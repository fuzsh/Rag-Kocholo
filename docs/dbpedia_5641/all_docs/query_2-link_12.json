        "text": "Prostaglandin E2 Stimulates EP2, Adenylate Cyclase, Phospholipase C, and Intracellular Calcium Release to Mediate Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Production in Dental Pulp Cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Mei-Chi; Lin, Szu-I; Lin, Li-Deh; Chan, Chiu-Po; Lee, Ming-Shu; Wang, Tong-Mei; Jeng, Po-Yuan; Yeung, Sin-Yuet; Jeng, Jiiang-Huei\n\n2016-04-01\n\nProstaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a crucial role in pulpal inflammation and repair. However, its induction of signal transduction pathways is not clear but is crucial for future control of pulpal inflammation. Primary dental pulp cells were exposed to PGE2 and 19R-OH PGE2 (EP2 agonist) or sulprostone (EP1/EP3 agonist) for 5 to 40Â minutes. Cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with SQ22536 (adenylate cyclase inhibitor), H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), dorsomorphin (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibitor), U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), thapsigargin (inhibitor of intracellular calcium release), W7 (calmodulin antagonist), verapamil (L-type calcium channel blocker), and EGTA (extracellular calcium chelator) for 20Â minutes before the addition of PGE2. PGE2 and 19R-OH PGE2 (EP2 agonist) stimulated cAMP production, whereas sulprostone (EP1/EP3 agonist) shows little effect. PGE2-induced cAMP production was attenuated by SQ22536 and U73122 but not H89 and dorsomorphin. Intriguingly, thapsigargin and W7 prevented PGE2-induced cAMP production, but verapamil and EGTA showed little effect. These results indicate that PGE2-induced cAMP production is associated with EP2 receptor and adenylate cyclase activation. These events are mediated by phospholipase C, intracellular calcium release, and calcium-calmodulin signaling. These results are helpful for understanding the role of PGE2 in pulpal inflammation and repair and possible future drug intervention. Copyright Â© 2016 American Association of Endodontists.

Because adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to inhibit cell proliferation, we examined the phosphorylation status of AMPK and p53 and the expression level of p21(waf1/cip1) after treating HDFs with LPA and ACI. Phosphorylation of AMPKalpha on threonine-172 (p-Thr172-AMPKalpha) increases its catalytic activity but phosphorylation on serine-485/491 (p-Ser485/491-AMPKalpha) reduces the accessibility of the Thr172 phosphorylation site thereby inhibiting its catalytic activity. LPA increased p-Ser485/491-AMPKalpha, presumably by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). However, ACI reduced p-Thr172-AMPKalpha by inhibiting the LKB signaling. Our data demonstrated that both LPA and ACI inhibit the catalytic activity of AMPKalpha and p53 by differentially regulating phosphorylation of AMPKalpha, causing increased senescent cell proliferation. These findings suggest that the proliferation potential of senescent HDFs can be modulated through the regulation of the AMPK signaling pathway.\n\nEffects of chlorogenic acid on carbachol-induced contraction of mouse urinary bladder.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneda, Takeharu; Sasaki, Noriyasu; Urakawa, Norimoto; Shimizu, Kazumasa\n\n2018-01-01\n\nChlorogenic acid (CGA) is a polyphenol found in coffee and medicinal herbs such as Lonicera japonica. In this study, the effect of CGA-induced relaxation on carbachol (CCh)-induced contraction of mouse urinary bladder was investigated. CGA (30-300Â Î¼g/ml) inhibited CCh- or U46619-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. SQ22536 (adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) recovered CGA-induced relaxation of CCh-induced contraction; however, ODQ (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) did not have the same effect. In addition, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) enhanced CGA-induced relaxation; however, forskolin or sodium nitroprusside did not have the same effect. Moreover, Ro 20-1724, a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, enhanced CGA-induced relaxation, but vardenafil, a selective PDE5 inhibitor, did not have the same effect. In the presence of CCh, CGA increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level, whereas SQ22536 inhibited the increase of cAMP levels. Moreover, higher cAMP levels were obtained with CGA plus IBMX treatment than the total cAMP levels obtained with separate CGA and IBMX treatments. In conclusion, these results suggest that CGA inhibited CCh-induced contraction of mouse urinary bladder by partly increasing cAMP levels via adenylyl cyclase activation.

AC genes were constructed into transfer vectors in a form fused with fluorescent protein or polyhistidine at the C-terminus. The recombinant BVs were collected by ultracentrifugation and AC expression was verified using western blotting. The BVs and giant liposomes generated using gentle hydration were fused under acidic conditions; the incorporation of AC into giant liposomes was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy through the emission of fluorescence from their membranes. The AC-expressing BVs were also fused with liposomes containing the substrate (ATP) with/without a specific inhibitor (SQ 22536). An enzyme immunoassay on extracts of the sample demonstrated that cAMP was produced inside the liposomes. This procedure facilitates direct introduction of large transmembrane proteins into artificial membranes without solubilization.\n\nBlocking adenylyl cyclase inhibits olfactory generator currents induced by \"IP(3)-odors\".\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, S; Lane, A P; Bock, R; Leinders-Zufall, T; Zufall, F\n\n2000-07-01\n\nVertebrate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) transduce odor stimuli into electrical signals by means of an adenylyl cyclase/cAMP second messenger cascade, but it remains widely debated whether this cAMP cascade mediates transduction for all odorants or only certain odor classes. To address this problem, we have analyzed the generator currents induced by odors that failed to produce cAMP in previous biochemical assays but instead produced IP(3) (\"IP(3)-odors\"). We show that in single salamander ORNs, sensory responses to \"cAMP-odors\" and IP(3)-odors are not mutually exclusive but coexist in the same cells. The currents induced by IP(3)-odors exhibit identical biophysical properties as those induced by cAMP odors or direct activation of the cAMP cascade. By disrupting adenylyl cyclase to block cAMP formation using two potent antagonists of adenylyl cyclase, SQ22536 and MDL12330A, we show that this molecular step is necessary for the transduction of both odor classes. To assess whether these results are also applicable to mammals, we examine the electrophysiological responses to IP(3)-odors in intact mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE) by recording field potentials. The results show that inhibition of adenylyl cyclase prevents EOG responses to both odor classes in mouse MOE, even when \"hot spots\" with heightened sensitivity to IP(3)-odors are examined.\n\ncAMP Level Modulates Scleral Collagen Remodeling, a Critical Step in the Development of Myopia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Shufeng; Fang, Fang; Lu, Runxia; Lu, Chanyi; Zheng, Min; An, Jianhong; Xu, Hongjia; Zhao, Fuxin; Chen, Jiang-fan; Qu, Jia; Zhou, Xiangtian\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe development of myopia is associated with decreased ocular scleral collagen synthesis in humans and animal models. Collagen synthesis is, in part, under the influence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). We investigated the associations between cAMP, myopia development in guinea pigs, and collagen synthesis by human scleral fibroblasts (HSFs). Form-deprived myopia (FDM) was induced by unilateral masking of guinea pig eyes. Scleral cAMP levels increased selectively in the FDM eyes and returned to normal levels after unmasking and recovery. Unilateral subconjunctival treatment with the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator forskolin resulted in a myopic shift accompanied by reduced collagen mRNA levels, but it did not affect retinal electroretinograms. The AC inhibitor SQ22536 attenuated the progression of FDM. Moreover, forskolin inhibited collagen mRNA levels and collagen secretion by HSFs. The inhibition was reversed by SQ22536. These results demonstrate a critical role of cAMP in control of myopia development. Selective regulation of cAMP to control scleral collagen synthesis may be a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating myopia.

Repaglinide induced vasorelaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. The repaglinide-induced vasorelaxation was not affected by removal of the endothelium. In addition, application of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) and a small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SKCa) channel inhibitor (apamin) did not alter the vasorelaxant effect of repaglinide on endothelium-intact arteries. Pretreatment with an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (SQ 22536) or a PKA inhibitor (KT 5720) effectively reduced repaglinide-induced vasorelaxation. Also, pretreatment with a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor (ODQ) or a PKG inhibitor (KT 5823) inhibited repaglinide-induced vasorelaxation. However, pretreatment with a voltage-dependent K(+) (Kv) channel inhibitor (4-AP), ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel inhibitor (glibenclamide), large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BKCa) channel inhibitor (paxilline), or the inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channel inhibitor (Ba(2+)) did not affect the vasorelaxant effect of repaglinide. Furthermore, pretreatment with a Ca(2+) inhibitor (nifedipine) and a sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor (thapsigargin) did not affect the vasorelaxant effect of repaglinide. The vasorelaxant effect of repaglinide was not affected by elevated glucose (50mM). Based on these results, we conclude that repaglinide induces vasorelaxation via activation of adenylyl cyclase/PKA and guanylyl cyclase/PKG signaling pathways independently of the endothelium, K(+) channels, Ca(2+) channels, and intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i).

Sulforaphane was found to have very potent inhibitory effects on tumor growth through regulation of diverse mechanisms. However, no data are available concerning the effects of sulforaphane on platelet activation and its relative issues. Activation of platelets caused by arterial thrombosis is relevant to a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the in vivo antithrombotic effects of sulforaphane and its possible mechanisms in platelet activation. Sulforaphane (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) was effective in reducing the mortality of ADP-induced acute pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. Other in vivo studies also revealed that sulforaphane (0.25 mg/kg) significantly prolonged platelet plug formation in mice. In addition, sulforaphane (15-75 Î¼M) exhibited more-potent activity of inhibiting platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen. Sulforaphane inhibited platelet activation accompanied by inhibiting relative Ca(2+) mobilization; phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)Î³2, protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt; and hydroxyl radical (OH(â)) formation. Sulforaphane markedly increased cyclic (c)AMP, but not cyclic (c)GMP levels, and stimulated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation. SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, but not ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxal in-1-one), an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, obviously reversed the sulforaphane-mediated effects on platelet aggregation; PKC activation, p38 MAPK, Akt and VASP phosphorylation; and OH(â) formation. Furthermore, a PI3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) and a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) both significantly diminished PKC activation and p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation; in contrast, a PKC inhibitor (RO318220) did not diminish p38 MAPK or Akt phosphorylation stimulated by collagen. This\n\nAmarogentin, a secoiridoid glycoside, abrogates platelet activation through PLC Î³ 2-PKC and MAPK pathways.\n\nPubMed\n\nYen, Ting-Lin; Lu, Wan-Jung; Lien, Li-Ming; Thomas, Philip Aloysius; Lee, Tzu-Yin; Chiu, Hou-Chang; Sheu, Joen-Rong; Lin, Kuan-Hung\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAmarogentin, an active principle of Gentiana lutea, possess antitumorigenic, antidiabetic, and antioxidative properties. Activation of platelets is associated with intravascular thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases. The present study examined the effects of amarogentin on platelet activation. Amarogentin treatment (15~60â Î¼M) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen, but not thrombin, arachidonic acid, and U46619. Amarogentin inhibited collagen-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) Î³2, protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). It also inhibits in vivo thrombus formation in mice. In addition, neither the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ nor the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 affected the amarogentin-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation, which suggests that amarogentin does not regulate the levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. In conclusion, amarogentin prevents platelet activation through the inhibition of PLC Î³2-PKC cascade and MAPK pathway. Our findings suggest that amarogentin may offer therapeutic potential for preventing or treating thromboembolic disorders.\n\nAmarogentin, a Secoiridoid Glycoside, Abrogates Platelet Activation through PLCÎ³2-PKC and MAPK Pathways\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYen, Ting-Lin; Lu, Wan-Jung; Lien, Li-Ming; Thomas, Philip Aloysius; Lee, Tzu-Yin; Chiu, Hou-Chang; Sheu, Joen-Rong\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAmarogentin, an active principle of Gentiana lutea, possess antitumorigenic, antidiabetic, and antioxidative properties.

Serelaxin elicits potent uterine and vascular relaxation via its cognate receptor, RXFP1, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and is being clinically evaluated for the treatment of acute heart failure. However, its direct bronchodilator efficacy has yet to be explored. Tracheal rings were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250â350 g) and tricolor guinea pigs, and precision cut lung slices (PCLSs) containing intrapulmonary airways were prepared from rats only. Recombinant human serelaxin (rhRLX) alone and in combination with rosiglitazone (PPARÎ³ agonist; recently described as a novel dilator) or Î²-adrenoceptor agonists (isoprenaline, salbutamol) were added either to pre-contracted airways, or before contraction with methacholine or endothelin-1. Regulation of rhRLX responses by epithelial removal, indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), L-NAME (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), SQ22536 (adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and ODQ (guanylate cyclase inhibitor) were also evaluated. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize RXFP1 to airway epithelium and smooth muscle. rhRLX elicited relaxation in rat trachea and PCLS, more slowly than rosiglitazone or isoprenaline, but potentiated relaxation to both these dilators. It markedly increased Î²-adrenoceptor agonist potency in guinea pig trachea. rhRLX, rosiglitazone, and isoprenaline pretreatment also inhibited the development of rat tracheal contraction. Bronchoprotection by rhRLX increased with longer pre-incubation time, and was partially reduced by epithelial removal, indomethacin and/or L-NAME. SQ22536 and ODQ also partially inhibited rhRLX-mediated relaxation in both intact and epithelial-denuded trachea. RXFP1 expression in the airways was at higher levels in epithelium than smooth muscle. In summary, rhRLX elicits large and small airway relaxation via epithelial-dependent and -independent mechanisms, likely\n\n\"Inject-mix-react-separate-and-quantitate\" (IMReSQ) method for screening enzyme inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Edmund; Okhonin, Victor; Berezovski, Maxim V; Nozaki, Tomoyoshi; Waldmann, Herbert; Alexandrov, Kirill; Krylov, Sergey N\n\n2008-09-10\n\nMany regulatory enzymes are considered attractive therapeutic targets, and their inhibitors are potential drug candidates. Screening combinatorial libraries for enzyme inhibitors is pivotal to identifying hit compounds for the development of drugs targeting regulatory enzymes. Here, we introduce the first inhibitor screening method that consumes only nanoliters of the reactant solutions and is applicable to regulatory enzymes. The method is termed inject-mix-react-separate-and-quantitate (IMReSQ) and includes five steps. First, nanoliter volumes of substrate, candidate inhibitor, and enzyme solutions are injected by pressure into a capillary as separate plugs. Second, the plugs are mixed inside this capillary microreactor by transverse diffusion of laminar flow profiles. Third, the reaction mixture is incubated to form the enzymatic product. Fourth, the product is separated from the substrate inside the capillary by electrophoresis. Fifth, the amounts of the product and substrate are quantitated. In this proof-of-principle work, we applied IMReSQ to study inhibition of recently cloned protein farnesyltransferase from parasite Entamoeba histolytica. This enzyme is a potential therapeutic target for antiparasitic drugs. We identified three previously unknown inhibitors of this enzyme and proved that IMReSQ could be used for quantitatively ranking the potencies of inhibitors.\n\nEx vivo and in vivo studies of CME-1, a novel polysaccharide purified from the mycelia of Cordyceps sinensis that inhibits human platelet activation by activating adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Wan-Jung; Chang, Nen-Chung; Jayakumar, Thanasekaran; Liao, Jiun-Cheng; Lin, Mei-Jiun; Wang, Shwu-Huey; Chou, Duen-Suey; Thomas, Philip Aloysius; Sheu, Joen-Rong\n\n2014-12-01\n\nCME-1, a novel water-soluble polysaccharide, was purified from the mycelia of Cordyceps sinensis, and its chemical structure was characterized to contain mannose and galactose in a ratio of 4:6 (27.6 kDa). CME-1 was originally observed to exert a potent inhibitory effect on tumor migration and a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress. Activation of platelets caused by arterial thrombosis is relevant to various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, no data are available concerning the effects of CME-1 on platelet activation. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the ex vivo and in vivo antithrombotic effects of CME-1 and its possible mechanisms in platelet activation. The aggregometry, immunoblotting, flow cytometric analysis and platelet functional analysis were used in this study. CME-1 (2.3-7.6 Î¼M) exhibited highly potent activity in inhibiting human platelet aggregation when stimulated by collagen, thrombin, and arachidonic acid but not by U46619. CME-1 inhibited platelet activation accompanied by inhibiting Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and hydroxyl radical (OH(â)) formation. However, CME-1 interrupted neither FITC-triflavin nor FITC-collagen binding to platelets. CME-1 markedly increased cyclic AMP levels, but not cyclic GMP levels, and stimulated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation. SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, but not ODQ, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, obviously reversed the CME-1-mediated effects on platelet aggregation and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), Akt, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and TxB2 formation. CME-1 substantially prolonged the closure time of whole blood and the occlusion time of platelet plug formation. This study demonstrates for the first time that CME-1 exhibits highly potent antiplatelet activity that may initially activate adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP and, subsequently, inhibit intracellular signals (such as Akt and\n\nA xanthine-based epithelium-dependent airway relaxant KMUP-3 (7-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-dimethylxanthine) increases respiratory performance and protects against tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced tracheal contraction, involving nitric oxide release and expression of cGMP and protein kinase G.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Rong-Jyh; Wu, Bin-Nan; Lo, Yi-Ching; An, Li-Mei; Dai, Zen-Kong; Lin, Young-Tso; Tang, Chao-Shun; Chen, Ing-Jun\n\n2006-02-01\n\nKMUP-3 (7-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzene)piperazinyl]ethyl]-1,3-dimethylxanthine) was investigated in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle. Intratracheal instillation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (0.01 mg/kg/300 microl) induced bronchoconstriction, increases of lung resistance, and decreases of dynamic lung compliance. Instillation of KMUP-3 (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) reversed this situation. In isolated trachea precontracted with carbachol, KMUP-3 (10-100 microM)-caused relaxations were attenuated by epithelium removal and by pretreatments with an inhibitor of K(+) channel, tetraethylammonium (10 mm); K(ATP) channel, glibenclamide (1 microM); voltage-dependent K(+) channel, 4-aminopyridine (100 microM); Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channel, charybdotoxin (0.1 microM) or apamin (1 microM); soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1one (ODQ, 1 microM); nitric-oxide (NO) synthase, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 microM); and adenylate cyclase, SQ 22536 [9-(terahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine] (100 microM). KMUP-3 (0.01-100 microM) induced increases of cGMP and cAMP in primary culture of tracheal smooth muscle cells (TSMCs). The increase in cGMP by KMUP-3 was reduced by ODQ and L-NAME; the increase in cAMP was reduced by SQ 22536. Western blot analysis indicated that KMUP-3 (1 microM) induced expression of protein kinase A (PKA)(ri) and protein kinase G (PKG)(1alpha 1beta) in TSMCs.SQ 22536 inhibited KMUP-3-induced expression of (PKA)(ri). On the contrary, ODQ inhibited KMUP-3-induced expression of PKG(1alpha 1beta) In epithelium-intact trachea, KMUP-3 increased the NO release. Activation of sGC, NO release, and inhibition of phosphodiesterases in TSMCs by KMUP-3 may result in increases of intracellular cGMP and cAMP, which subsequently activate PKG and PKA, efflux of K(+) ion, and associated reduction in Ca(2+) influx in vitro, indicating the action mechanism to protect against TNF-alpha-induced airway dysfunction in vivo.\n\nCalcium influx through L-type channels attenuates skeletal muscle contraction via inhibition of adenylyl cyclases.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenezes-Rodrigues, Francisco Sandro; Pires-Oliveira, Marcelo; Duarte, Thiago; Paredes-Gamero, Edgar Julian; Chiavegatti, Tiago; Godinho, Rosely Oliveira\n\n2013-11-15\n\nSkeletal muscle contraction is triggered by acetylcholine induced release of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although this signaling pathway is independent of extracellular Ca(2+), L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav) blockers have inotropic effects on frog skeletal muscles which occur by an unknown mechanism. Taking into account that skeletal muscle fiber expresses Ca(+2)-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms and that cAMP is able to increase skeletal muscle contraction force, we investigated the role of Ca(2+) influx on mouse skeletal muscle contraction and the putative crosstalk between extracellular Ca(2+) and intracellular cAMP signaling pathways. The effects of Cav blockers (verapamil and nifedipine) and extracellular Ca(2+) chelator EGTA were evaluated on isometric contractility of mouse diaphragm muscle under direct electrical stimulus (supramaximal voltage, 2 ms, 0.1 Hz). Production of cAMP was evaluated by radiometric assay while Ca(2+) transients were assessed by confocal microscopy using L6 cells loaded with fluo-4/AM. Ca(2+) channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine had positive inotropic effect, which was mimicked by removal of extracellular Ca(+2) with EGTA or Ca(2+)-free Tyrode. While phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX potentiates verapamil positive inotropic effect, it was abolished by AC inhibitors SQ22536 and NYK80. Finally, the inotropic effect of verapamil was associated with increased intracellular cAMP content and mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+), indicating that positive inotropic effects of Ca(2+) blockers depend on cAMP formation. Together, our results show that extracellular Ca(2+) modulates skeletal muscle contraction, through inhibition of Ca(2+)-sensitive AC. The cross-talk between extracellular calcium and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways appears to regulate the extent of skeletal muscle contraction responses.

We have discovered a new class of small molecule inhibitors of sGC and have characterised a compound designated D12 (compound 10) which binds to the catalytic domain of the enzyme with a KD of 11Â Î¼M in a SPR assay.

We designed a library of glutamyl cyclase (QC) inhibitors based on the proposed binding mode of the preferred substrate, AÎ² 3E-42 . An in vitro structure-activity relationship study identified several excellent QC inhibitors demonstrating 5- to 40-fold increases in potency compared to a known QC inhibitor. When tested in mouse models of AD, compound 212 significantly reduced the brain concentrations of pyroform AÎ² and total AÎ² and restored cognitive functions. This potent AÎ²-lowering effect was achieved by incorporating an additional binding region into our previously established pharmacophoric model, resulting in strong interactions with the carboxylate group of Glu327 in the QC binding site. Our study offers useful insights in designing novel QC inhibitors as a potential treatment option for AD.\n\nStructures of Human Golgi-resident Glutaminyl Cyclase and Its Complexes with Inhibitors Reveal a Large Loop Movement upon Inhibitor Binding*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Kai-Fa; Liaw, Su-Sen; Huang, Wei-Lin; Chia, Cho-Yun; Lo, Yan-Chung; Chen, Yi-Ling; Wang, Andrew H.-J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAberrant pyroglutamate formation at the N terminus of certain peptides and proteins, catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclases (QCs), is linked to some pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer disease. Recently, a glutaminyl cyclase (QC) inhibitor, PBD150, was shown to be able to reduce the deposition of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-Î² peptides in brain of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease, leading to a significant improvement of learning and memory in those transgenic animals.

Upon binding to PBD150, a large loop movement in gQC allows the inhibitor to be tightly held in its active site primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Further comparisons of the inhibitor-bound structures revealed distinct interactions of the inhibitors with gQC and sQC, which are consistent with the results from our inhibitor assays reported here. Because gQC and sQC may play different biological roles in vivo, the different inhibitor binding modes allow the design of specific inhibitors toward gQC and sQC.

While ATP-sensitive potassium channels are mainly involved in this relaxant effect in vascular smooth muscle, the mechanism in other smooth muscles has not been revealed yet. In the present study, we investigated how H(2)S relaxes non-vascular smooth muscle by using intact and Î²-escin permeabilized guinea-pig taenia caecum. In intact tissues, concentration-dependent relaxation response to H(2)S donor NaHS in carbachol-precontracted preparations did not change in the presence of a K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide, adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ-22536, guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, protein kinase A inhibitor KT-5720, protein kinase C inhibitor H-7, tetrodotoxin, apamin/charybdotoxin, NOS inhibitor L-NAME and cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. We then studied how H(2)S affected carbachol- or Ca(2+)-induced contractions in permeabilized tissues. When Ca(2+) was clamped to a constant value (pCa6), a further contraction could be elicited by carbachol that was decreased by NaHS. This decrease in contraction was reversed by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase or N-acetyl cysteine. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid, also decreased the carbachol-induced contraction that was further inhibited by NaHS. Mitochondrial proton pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide p-trifluromethoxyphenylhydrazone also decreased the carbachol-induced contraction but this was not additionally changed by NaHS. The carbachol-induced Ca(2+) sensitization, calcium concentration-response curves, IP(3)- and caffeine-induced contractions were not affected by NaHS. In conclusion, we propose that hydrogen peroxide and mitochondria may have a role in H(2)S-induced relaxation response in taenia caecum. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, its effect on platelet aggregation, a critical factor in arterial thrombosis, remains unclear. Consequently, chlorogenic acid-action mechanisms in preventing platelet activation and thrombus formation were examined. Methods and Results Chlorogenic acid in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 1 mmol/L) inhibited platelet secretion and aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid and TRAP-6, and diminished platelet firm adhesion/aggregation and platelet-leukocyte interactions under flow conditions. At these concentrations chlorogenic acid significantly decreased platelet inflammatory mediators (sP-selectin, sCD40L, CCL5 and IL-1Î²) and increased intraplatelet cAMP levels/PKA activation. Interestingly, SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and ZM241385 (a potent A2A receptor antagonist) attenuated the antiplatelet effect of chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid is compatible to the active site of the adenosine A2A receptor as revealed through molecular modeling. In addition, chlorogenic acid had a significantly lower effect on mouse bleeding time when compared to the same dose of aspirin. Conclusions Antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of chlorogenic acid are associated with the A2A receptor/adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.

The hallmark of this principle is the prevention of the formation of Abeta(3,11(pE)-40,42), as these Abeta-species were shown to be of elevated neurotoxicity and likely to act as a seeding core leading to an accelerated formation of Abeta-oligomers and fibrils. Starting from 1-(3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)thiourea, bioisosteric replacements led to the development of new classes of inhibitors. The optimization of the metal-binding group was achieved by homology modeling and afforded a first insight into the probable binding mode of the inhibitors in the hQC active site. The efficacy assessment of the hQC inhibitors was performed in cell culture, directly monitoring the inhibition of Abeta(3,11(pE)-40,42) formation.\n\nIdentification of an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor for treating neuropathic and inflammatory pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hansen; Xu, Hui; Wu, Long-Jun; Kim, Susan S; Chen, Tao; Koga, Kohei; Descalzi, Giannina; Gong, Bo; Vadakkan, Kunjumon I; Zhang, Xuehan; Kaang, Bong-Kiun; Zhuo, Min\n\n2011-01-12\n\nNeuropathic pain, often caused by nerve injury, is commonly observed among patients with different diseases. Because its basic mechanisms are poorly understood, effective medications are limited. Previous investigations of basic pain mechanisms and drug discovery efforts have focused mainly on early sensory neurons such as dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn neurons, and few synaptic-level studies or new drugs are designed to target the injury-related cortical plasticity that accompanies neuropathic pain. Our previous work has demonstrated that calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) is critical for nerve injury-induced synaptic changes in the anterior cingulate cortex. Through rational drug design and chemical screening, we have identified a lead candidate AC1 inhibitor, NB001, which is relatively selective for AC1 over other adenylate cyclase isoforms. Using a variety of behavioral tests and toxicity studies, we have found that NB001, when administered intraperitoneally or orally, has an analgesic effect in animal models of neuropathic pain, without any apparent side effects. Our study thus shows that AC1 could be a productive therapeutic target for neuropathic pain and describes a new agent for the possible treatment of neuropathic pain.\n\nThe Mechanism of Action of Zingerone in the Pacemaker Potentials of Interstitial Cells of Cajal Isolated from Murine Small Intestine.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Jung Nam; Kim, Hyun Jung; Kim, Iksung; Kim, Yun Tai; Kim, Byung Joo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nZingerone, a major component found in ginger root, is clinically effective for the treatment of various diseases. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are the pacemaker cells responsible for slow waves in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We investigated the effects of zingerone on the pacemaker potentials of ICCs to assess its mechanisms of action and its potential as a treatment for GI tract motility disorder. We isolated ICCs from small intestines, and the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record the pacemaker potentials in cultured ICCs. Under the current clamping mode, zingerone inhibited pacemaker potentials of ICCs concentration-dependently. These effects were blocked not by capsazepine, a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel blocker, but by glibenclamide, a specific ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker. Pretreatment with SQ-22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor), LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), and calphostin C (a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor) did not block the effects of zingerone on the pacemaker potentials relative to treatment with zingerone alone. However, zingerone-induced pacemaker potential inhibition was blocked by 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; a guanylate cyclase inhibitor), KT5823 (a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor), and L-NAME (a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor). In addition, zingerone stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production in ICCs. Finally, pretreatment with PD98059 (a p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor), SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), and SP600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)-specific inhibitor) blocked the zingerone-induced pacemaker potential inhibition. These results suggest that zingerone concentration-dependently inhibits pacemaker potentials of ICCs via NO/cGMP-dependent ATP-sensitive K+ channels through MAPK-dependent pathways. Taken together, this study shows that zingerone may have the potential\n\n25 CFR 225.36 - Minerals agreement cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs notice of noncompliance.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-04-01\n\n... 25 Indians 1 2012-04-01 2011-04-01 true Minerals agreement cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs...

The triphosphate chain, position 8 of the adenine base and the ribose residue of the ATP molecule were modified. Despite the presence of the alkylating groups in two former types of the analogs tested, no covalent blocking of the active site of the enzyme was observed. Most of the compounds appeared to be competitive reversible inhibitors. The kinetic data confirmed the importance of the triphosphate chain for substrate binding in the active site of adenylate cyclase. (Formula: See Text) The inhibitors with different substituents in position 8 of the adenine base had a low affinity for the enzyme. The possible orientation of the triphosphate chain and the advantages of anti-conformation of the ATP molecule for their binding in the active site of adenylate cyclase are discussed.\n\nInhibition of Heat-Stable Toxin-Induced Intestinal Salt and Water Secretion by a Novel Class of Guanylyl Cyclase C Inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nBijvelds, Marcel J C; Loos, Michaela; Bronsveld, Inez; Hellemans, Ann; Bongartz, Jean-Pierre; Ver Donck, Luc; Cox, Eric; de Jonge, Hugo R; Schuurkes, Jan A J; De Maeyer, Joris H\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMany enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains produce the heat-stable toxin, STa, which, by activation of the intestinal receptor-enzyme guanylyl cyclase (GC) C, triggers an acute, watery diarrhea. We set out to identify GCC inhibitors that may be of benefit for the treatment of infectious diarrheal disease. Compounds that inhibit STa-induced cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) production were selected by performing cyclase assays on cells and membranes containing GCC, or the related GCA. The effect of leads on STa/GCC-dependent activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator anion channel was investigated in T84 cells, and in porcine and human intestinal tissue. Their effect on STa-provoked fluid transport was assessed in ligated intestinal loops in piglets. Four N-2-(propylamino)-6-phenylpyrimidin-4-one-substituted piperidines were shown to inhibit GCC-mediated cellular cGMP production. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations were â¤ 5 Ã 10(-7) mol/L, whereas they were >10 times higher for GCA. In T84 monolayers, these leads blocked STa/GCC-dependent, but not forskolin/adenylyl cyclase-dependent, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity. GCC inhibition reduced STa-provoked anion secretion in pig jejunal tissue, and fluid retention and cGMP levels in STa-exposed loops. These GCC inhibitors blocked STa-provoked anion secretion in rectal biopsy specimens. We have identified a novel class of GCC inhibitors that may form the basis for development of future therapeutics for (infectious) diarrheal disease. Â© The Author 2015.

Receptor mechanisms were assessed by cross-adaptation with amino acids (L-cysteine, L-phenylalanine and 1-methyl-L-tryptophan) and bile acids (taurocholic acid and cholic acid). This suggested that relatively specific receptors exist for 1-methyl-L-tryptophan and L-phenylalanine (food-related odorants) in the lower epithelium, and for taurocholic acid (conspecific-derived odorant) in the upper. Inhibition by U73122 [a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor] suggested that olfactory responses to amino acids were mediated mostly, but not entirely, by PLC-mediated transduction (IC50 ; 15-55 nM), whereas bile acid responses were mediated by both PLC and adenylate cyclase-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AC-cAMP) (using SQ-22536; an AC inhibitor). Simultaneous application of both drugs rarely inhibited responses completely, suggesting possible involvement of non-PLC and non-AC mediated mechanisms. For aromatic amino acids and bile acids, there were differences in the contribution of each transduction pathway (PLC, AC and non-PLC and non-AC) between the two epithelia. These results suggest that differences in sensitivity of the two epithelia are associated with differences in odorant receptors and transduction mechanisms.

Seven membrane forms, which presumably exist as homodimers, and four subunits of apparent heterodimers (commonly referred to as the soluble forms) are known, but in animals such as nematodes, much larger numbers of GCs are expressed. The number of transmembrane segments (none, one, or multiple) divide the GC family into three groups. Those with no or one transmembrane segment bind nitric oxide/carbon monoxide (NO/CO) or peptides. There are no known ligands for the multiple transmembrane segment class of GCs. Mutational and structural analyses support a model where catalysis requires a shared substrate binding site between the subunits, whether homomeric or heteromeric in nature. Because some cyclases or cyclase ligand genes lack specific GC inhibitors, disruption of either has been used to define the functions of individual cyclases, as well as to define human genetic disease counterparts.\n\nHigh-throughput screening using the differential radial capillary action of ligand assay identifies ebselen as an inhibitor of diguanylate cyclases.\n\nPubMed\n\nLieberman, Ori J; Orr, Mona W; Wang, Yan; Lee, Vincent T\n\n2014-01-17\n\nThe rise of bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics has motivated recent efforts to identify new drug candidates that target virulence factors or their regulatory pathways. One such antivirulence target is the cyclic-di-GMP (cdiGMP) signaling pathway, which regulates biofilm formation, motility, and pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen that utilizes cdiGMP-regulated polysaccharides, including alginate and pellicle polysaccharide (PEL), to mediate virulence and antibiotic resistance. CdiGMP activates PEL and alginate biosynthesis by binding to specific receptors including PelD and Alg44. Mutations that abrogate cdiGMP binding to these receptors prevent polysaccharide production. Identification of small molecules that can inhibit cdiGMP binding to the allosteric sites on these proteins could mimic binding defective mutants and potentially reduce biofilm formation or alginate secretion. Here, we report the development of a rapid and quantitative high-throughput screen for inhibitors of protein-cdiGMP interactions based on the differential radial capillary action of ligand assay (DRaCALA). Using this approach, we identified ebselen as an inhibitor of cdiGMP binding to receptors containing an RxxD domain including PelD and diguanylate cyclases (DGC). Ebselen reduces diguanylate cyclase activity by covalently modifying cysteine residues. Ebselen oxide, the selenone analogue of ebselen, also inhibits cdiGMP binding through the same covalent mechanism. Ebselen and ebselen oxide inhibit cdiGMP regulation of biofilm formation and flagella-mediated motility in P. aeruginosa through inhibition of diguanylate cyclases. The identification of ebselen provides a proof-of-principle that a DRaCALA high-throughput screening approach can be used to identify bioactive agents that reverse regulation of cdiGMP signaling by targeting cdiGMP-binding domains.\n\nProtective Mechanisms of S. lycopersicum Aqueous Fraction (Nucleosides and Flavonoids) on Platelet Activation and Thrombus Formation: In Vitro, Ex Vivo and In Vivo Studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nFuentes, Eduardo; Pereira, Jaime; AlarcÃ³n, Marcelo; Valenzuela, Claudio; PÃ©rez, Pablo; Astudillo, Luis; Palomo, IvÃ¡n\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this research was to investigate mechanisms of antiplatelet action of bioactive principle from S. lycopersicum.

R.; Carvalho, Vinicius F.; dos Santos, Marcelo H.; Silva, Patricia MR.; Martins, Marco A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPrevious studies have described the antispasmodic effect of mangiferin, a natural glucoside xanthone (2-C-Î²-Dgluco-pyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxyxanthone) that is present in mango trees and other plants, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the potential contribution of the nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway to the antispasmodic effect of mangiferin on isolated tracheal rings preparations. The functional effect of mangiferin on allergic and non-allergic contraction of guinea pig tracheal rings was assessed in conventional organ baths. Cultured tracheal rings were exposed to mangiferin or vehicle, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 3 and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels were quantified using western blotting and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. Mangiferin (0.1â10 ÂµM) inhibited tracheal contractions induced by distinct stimuli, such as allergen, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine or carbachol, in a concentration-dependent manner. Mangiferin also caused marked relaxation of tracheal rings that were precontracted by carbachol, suggesting that it has both anti-contraction and relaxant properties that are prevented by removing the epithelium. The effect of mangiferin was inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NÏ-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 ÂµM), and the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1], [2], [4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (10 ÂµM), but not the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine (SQ22536) (100 ÂµM). The antispasmodic effect of mangiferin was also sensitive to K+ channel blockers, such as tetraethylammonium (TEA), glibenclamide and apamin. Furthermore, mangiferin inhibited Ca2+-induced contractions in K+ (60 mM)-depolarised tracheal rings preparations. In addition, mangiferin increased NOS3 protein levels and cGMP intracellular levels in cultured tracheal rings. Finally, mangiferin-induced increase in cGMP levels was abrogated by co-incubation with either ODQ or L\n\nSQ10R.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShaughnessy, Michael F.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nDescribes SQ10R, a system of reading hints and strategies similar to SQ3R (that is, survey, question, read, recite, and review).

The inhibition of hQC prevents of the formation of the AÎ²3(pE)-40,42 species which were shown to be of elevated neurotoxicity and are likely to act as a seeding core, leading to an accelerated formation of AÎ²-oligomers and fibrils. This work presents a new class of inhibitors of hQC, resulting from a pharmacophore-based screen. Hit molecules were identified, containing benzimidazole as the metal binding group connected to 1,3,4-oxadiazole as the central scaffold. The subsequent optimization resulted in benzimidazolyl-1,3,4-thiadiazoles and -1,2,3-triazoles with an inhibitory potency in the nanomolar range. Further investigation into the potential binding mode of the new compound classes combined molecular docking and site directed mutagenesis studies.\n\nThe relationship between the agonist-induced activation and desensitization of the human tachykinin NK2 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaudsley, S; Gent, J P; Findlay, J B C; Donnelly, D\n\n1998-01-01\n\nRepeated applications of neurokininâA (NKA) to oocytes injected with 25âng wild-type hNK2 receptor cRNA caused complete attenuation of second and subsequent NKA-induced responses while analogous experiments using repeated applications of GR64349 and [Nle10]NKA(4â10) resulted in no such desensitization. This behaviour has been previously attributed to the ability of the different ligands to stabilize different active conformations of the receptor that have differing susceptibilities to receptor kinases (Nemeth & Chollet, 1995).However, for Xenopus oocytes injected (into the nucleus) with 10âng wild-type hNK2 receptor cDNA, a single 100ânM concentration of any of the three ligands resulted in complete desensitization to further concentrations.On the other hand, none of the ligands caused any desensitization in oocytes injected with 0.25âng wild-type hNK2 receptor cRNA, even at concentrations up to 10âÎ¼M.The two N-terminally truncated analogues of neurokininâA have a lower efficacy than NKA and it is likely that it is this property which causes the observed differences in desensitization, rather than the formation of alternative active states of the receptor.The peak calcium-dependent chloride current is not a reliable measure of maximal receptor stimulation and efficacy is better measured in this system by studying agonist-induced desensitization.The specific adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 can enhance NKA and GR64349-mediated desensitization which suggests that agonist-induced desensitization involves the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the subsequent down-regulation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, possibly by cross-talk to a second signalling pathway.

The resulting fragment library (204 compounds) was acquired from commercial suppliers and pre-screened by differential scanning fluorimetry followed by functional in vitro assays. In this way, 10 fragment hits were identified ([Formula: see text]5Â % hit rate, best inhibitory activity: 16 [Formula: see text]). The in vitro hits were then docked to the active site of QC, and the best scoring compounds were analyzed for binding interactions. Two fragments bound to different regions in a complementary manner, and thus, linking those fragments offered a rational strategy to generate novel QC inhibitors. Based on the structure of the virtual linked fragment, a 77-membered QC target focused library was selected from vendor databases and docked to the active site of QC. A PubChem search confirmed that the best scoring analogues are novel, potential QC inhibitors.\n\nInhibitory mechanisms of CME-1, a novel polysaccharide from the mycelia of Cordyceps sinensis, in platelet activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Yi; Hsu, Wen-Hsien; Lu, Wan-Jung; Jayakumar, Thanasekaran; Liao, Jiun-Cheng; Lin, Mei-Jiun; Wang, Shwu-Huey; Geraldine, Pitchairaj; Lin, Kuan-Hung; Sheu, Joen-Rong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCME-1 is a polysaccharide purified from the mycelia of medicinal mushroom Cordyceps sinensis, its molecular weight was determined to be 27.6 kDa by using nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The initiation of arterial thromboses is relevant to various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and is believed to involve platelet activation. Our recent study exhibited that CME-1 has potent antiplatelet activity via the activation of adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP ex vivo and in vivo. The aggregometry, and immunoblotting were used in this study. In this study, the mechanisms of CME-1 in platelet activation is further investigated and found that CME-1 inhibited platelet aggregation as well as the ATP-release reaction, relative intracellular [Ca(+2)] mobilization, and the phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)Î³2 and protein kinase C (PKC) stimulated by collagen. CME-1 has no effects on inhibiting either convulxin, an agonist of glycoprotein VI, or aggretin, an agonist of integrin Î±2Î²1 stimulated platelet aggregation. Moreover, this compound markedly diminished thrombin and arachidonic acid (AA) induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, and Akt. Treatment with SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, markedly diminished the CME-1-mediated increasing of cyclic AMP level and reversed prostaglandin E1- or CME-1-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and p38 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation stimulated by thrombin or AA. Furthermore, phosphodiesterase activity of human platelets was not altered by CME-1. The crucial finding of this study is that the antiplatelet activity of CME-1 may initially inhibit the PLCÎ³2-PKC-p47 cascade, and inhibit PI3-kinase/Akt and MAPK phosphorylation through adenylate cyclase/ cyclic AMP activation, then inhibit intracellular [Ca(+2)] mobilization, and, ultimately, inhibit platelet activation.

Iridium (Ir) compounds are considered to be potential alternatives to Pt compounds, as they possess promising anticancer effects with minor side effects. Platelet activation is associated with the metastasis and progression of cancer, and also with arterial thrombosis. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel, effective antithrombotic agents. An Ir (III)âderived complex, [Ir (Cp*) 1â(2âpyridyl)â3â(3âmethoxyphenyl)imidazo[1,5âa]pyridine Cl]BF4 (Irâ3), was developed as a novel antiplatelet drug. Irâ3 exerted more potent inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen compared with other agonists, including thrombin. In collagenâactivated platelets, Irâ3 also inhibited adenosine trisphosphate release, intracellular Ca+2 mobilization and surface Pâselectin expression, as well as the phosphorylation of phospholipase CÎ³2 (PLCÎ³2), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase B (Akt) and câJun Nâterminal kinase (JNK) 1, but not p38 mitogenâactivated protein kinase or extracellular signalâregulated kinases. Irâ3 did not markedly affect phorbol 12, 13âdibutyrateâstimulated platelet aggregation. Neither the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 nor the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1Hâ[1, 2, 4] oxadiazolo [4,3âa]quinoxalinâ1âone significantly reversed the Irâ3âmediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Furthermore, Irâ3 had no considerable diminishing effects on OH radical signals in collagenâstimulated platelets or Fenton reaction solution. In conclusion, Irâ3 serves a novel function in the inhibition of platelet aggregation through inhibiting the PLCÎ³2âPKC cascade, and the subsequent suppression of Akt and JNK1 activation. Therefore, Irâ3 may be a potential novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders, or the interplay between platelets and\n\nNicotine-induced activation of soluble adenylyl cyclase participates in ion transport regulation in mouse tracheal epithelium.\n\nPubMed\n\nHollenhorst, Monika I; Lips, Katrin S; Kummer, Wolfgang; Fronius, Martin\n\n2012-11-27\n\nFunctional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) have been identified in airway epithelia and their location in the apical and basolateral membrane makes them targets for acetylcholine released from neuronal and non-neuronal sources. One function of nAChR in airway epithelia is their involvement in the regulation of transepithelial ion transport by activation of chloride and potassium channels. However, the mechanisms underlying this nicotine-induced activation of ion transport are not fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of adenylyl cyclases in the nicotine-induced ion current in mouse tracheal epithelium. To evaluate the nicotine-mediated changes of transepithelial ion transport processes electrophysiological Ussing chamber measurements were applied and nicotine-induced ion currents were recorded in the absence and presence of adenylyl cyclase inhibitors. The ion current changes induced by nicotine (100 Î¼M, apical) were not altered in the presence of high doses of atropine (25 Î¼M, apical and basolateral), underlining the involvement of nAChR. Experiments with the transmembrane adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine (50 Î¼M, apical and basolateral) and the soluble adenylyl cyclase inhibitor KH7 (10 Î¼M, apical and basolateral) both reduced the nicotine-mediated ion current to a similar extent. Yet, a statistically significant reduction was obtained only in the experiments with KH7. This study indicates that nicotine binding to nAChR in mouse tracheal epithelium activates transepithelial ion transport involving adenylyl cyclase activity. This might be important for novel therapeutic strategies targeting epithelial ion transport mediated by the non-neuronal cholinergic system. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Intestinal epithelial barrier was established by Caco-2 monolayers. Cells were divided into four groups: normoxia (Nx), normoxia plus Forskolin(Nx+FSK), hypoxia(Hx), hypoxia plus SQ22536(Hx+SQ22536). cAMP concentrations of different groups were assessed by cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1 and occludin under normoxic and hypoxic condition. Caco-2 monolayers were grown on Millicell filters, and transepithelial electrical resistance(TER) was measured using a Millipore electric resistance system. The concentration of cAMP under hypoxic conditions(Hx group) was higher compared with Nx group [(6.30Â±0.50) pmol/L vs. (2.38Â±0.18) pmol/L, P<0.01]. At the same time, both mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1 and occluding were lower in Hx group than those in Nx group(all P<0.05). TER decreased by 76.30Â±0.64(P<0.01). When the monolayers were exposed to hypoxia plus SQ22536 (Hx+SQ22536 group), the concentration of cAMP was(2.12Â±0.23) pmol/L, which was lower than that under hypoxic conditions(Hx group, P<0.01). Both mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1 and occludin were higher compared to Hx group (all P<0.01). TER increased by 32.96Â±2.16 (P<0.05). When Caco-2 cells are exposed to hypoxia, barrier function, claudin-1 and occludin expression are diminished in parallel with a high level of intracellular cAMP compared with the normoxic condition. Inhibition of the intracellular cAMP level under hypoxia can maintain the intestinal epithelial function through regulating the claudin-1 and occludin expression and attenuate the permeability of intestinal mucosa.\n\nFABP4 is secreted from adipocytes by adenyl cyclase-PKA- and guanylyl cyclase-PKG-dependent lipolytic mechanisms.\n\nPubMed\n\nMita, Tomohiro; Furuhashi, Masato; Hiramitsu, Shinya; Ishii, Junnichi; Hoshina, Kyoko; Ishimura, Shutaro; Fuseya, Takahiro; Watanabe, Yuki; Tanaka, Marenao; Ohno, Kohei; Akasaka, Hiroshi; Ohnishi, Hirofumi; Yoshida, Hideaki; Saitoh, Shigeyuki; Shimamoto, Kazuaki; Miura, Tetsuji\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) is expressed in adipocytes, and elevated plasma FABP4 level is associated with obesity-mediated metabolic phenotype. Postprandial regulation and secretory signaling of FABP4 has been investigated. Time courses of FABP4 levels were examined during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; n=53) or a high-fat test meal eating (n=35). Effects of activators and inhibitors of adenyl cyclase (AC)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and guanylyl cyclase (GC)-protein kinase G (PKG) signaling on FABP4 secretion from mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were investigated. FABP4 level significantly declined after the OGTT or a high-fat meal eating, while insulin level was increased. Treatment with low and high glucose concentration or palmitate for 2 h did not affect FABP4 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. FABP4 secretion was increased by stimulation of lipolysis using isoproterenol, a Î²3 -adrenoceptor agonist (CL316243), forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and atrial natriuretic peptide, and the induced FABP4 secretion was suppressed by insulin or an inhibitor of PKA (H-89), PKG (KT5823) or hormone sensitive lipase (CAY10499). FABP4 is secreted from adipocytes in association with lipolysis regulated by AC-PKA- and GC-PKG-mediated signal pathways. Plasma FABP4 level declines postprandially, and suppression of FABP4 secretion by insulin-induced anti-lipolytic signaling may be involved in this decline in FABP4 level.

Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) increases iNOS expression and activity in a number of cell types but decreases cytokine-stimulated iNOS expression in hepatocytes. The mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Rat hepatocytes were stimulated with cytokines to induce iNOS and cultured with cAMP agonists dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP), 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin (FSK). Nitric oxide synthesis was assessed by supernatant nitrite levels and iNOS expression was measured by Northern and Western blot analyses. Nuclear factor kappaB binding was assessed by electromobility shift assay. Cyclic AMP dose dependently decreased NO synthesis in response to a combination of proinflammatory cytokines or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) alone. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22,536 increased cytokine- or IL-1beta-stimulated NO synthesis. dbcAMP decreased iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS protein expression. Both dbcAMP and glucagon decreased iNOS promoter activity in rat hepatocytes transfected with the murine iNOS promoter and decreased DNA binding of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. These data suggest that cAMP is important in hepatocyte iNOS expression and agents that alter cAMP levels may profoundly alter the response of hepatocytes to inflammatory stimuli through effects onthe iNOS promoter region and NF-kappaB.

The efforts of the scientific community generally are directed toward investigating the long-term effect of atrazine on complex functions (reproduction or respiration), but in the present study, we investigated the short-term effect on the short-circuit current (I(sc)), a quantitative measure of the ion transport operated by frog (Rana esculenta) skin. Treatment with 5 microM atrazine (1.08 mg/L) does not affect the transepithelial outfluxes of [14C]mannitol or [14C]urea; therefore, atrazine does not damage the barrier properties of frog skin. Atrazine causes a dose-dependent increase in the short-circuit current, with a minimum of 4.64 +/- 0.76 microA/cm2 (11.05% +/- 1.22%) and a maximum of 12.7 +/- 0.7 microA/cm2 (35% +/- 2.4%) measured at 10 nM and 5 microM, respectively. An increase in Isc also is caused by 5 microM ametryne, prometryn, simazine, terbuthylazine, or terbutryn (other atrazine derivatives). In particular, atrazine increases the transepithelial 22Na+ influx without affecting the outflux. Finally, stimulation of Isc by atrazine is suppressed by SQ 22536, H89, U73122, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and W7 (blockers of adenylate cyclase, protein kinase A, phospholipase C, intracellular Ca2+ increase, and calmodulin, respectively), whereas indomethacin and calphostin C (inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and protein kinase C, respectively) have no effect.\n\nPartial reactions of d-glucose 6-phosphateâ1 l-myoinositol 1-phosphate cyclase\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarnett, J. E. G.; Rasheed, A.; Corina, D. L.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nAfter removal of tightly bound NAD+ by using charcoal, a preparation of d-glucose 6-phosphateâ1 l-myoinositol 1-phosphate cyclase catalysed the reduction of 5-keto-d-glucitol 6-phosphate and 5-keto-d-glucose 6-phosphate by [4-3H]NADH to give [5-3H]-glucitol 6-phosphate and [5-3H]glucose 6-phosphate respectively. The position of the tritium atom in the latter was shown by degradation. Both enzyme-catalysed reductions were strongly inhibited by 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate, a powerful competitive inhibitor of inositol cyclase. The charcoal-treated enzyme preparation also converted 5-keto-d-glucose 6-phosphate into [3H]myoinositol 1-phosphate in the presence of [4-3H]NADH, but less effectively. These partial reactions of inositol cyclase are interpreted as providing strong evidence for the formation of 5-keto-d-glucose 6-phosphate as an enzyme-bound intermediate in the conversion of d-glucose 6-phosphate into 1 l-myoinositol 1-phosphate. The enzyme was partially inactivated by NaBH4 in the presence of NAD+. Glucose 6-phosphate did not increase the inactivation, and there was no inactivation in the absence of NAD+. There was no evidence for Schiff base formation during the cyclization. d-Glucitol 6-phosphate (l-sorbitol 1-phosphate) was a good inhibitor of the overall reaction. It did not inactivate the enzyme. The apparent molecular weight of inositol cyclase as determined by Sephadex chromatography was 2.15Ã105.

SQ109 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the trypomastigote form of the parasite, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for cell killing of 50 Â± 8 nM, but it had little effect (50% effective concentration [EC50], â¼80 Î¼M) in a red blood cell hemolysis assay. It also inhibited extracellular epimastigotes (IC50, 4.6 Â± 1 Î¼M) and the clinically relevant intracellular amastigotes (IC50, â¼0.5 to 1 Î¼M), with a selectivity index of â¼10 to 20. SQ109 caused major ultrastructural changes in all three life cycle forms, as observed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It rapidly collapsed the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÏm) in succinate-energized mitochondria, acting in the same manner as the uncoupler FCCP [carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone], and it caused the alkalinization of internal acidic compartments, effects that are likely to make major contributions to its mechanism of action. The compound also had activity against squalene synthase, binding to its active site; it inhibited sterol side-chain reduction and, in the amastigote assay, acted synergistically with the antifungal drug posaconazole, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.48, but these effects are unlikely to account for the rapid effects seen on cell morphology and cell killing. SQ109 thus most likely acts, at least in part, by collapsing ÎÏ/ÎpH, one of the major mechanisms demonstrated previously for its action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall, the results suggest that SQ109, which is currently in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug\n\nEffect of nitroso complexes of some transition metals on the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeverina, I S; Bussygina, O G; Grigorjev, N B\n\n1992-03-01\n\nEffects of nitroso complexes of some transition metals (Fe, Co, Cr), differing in the character of NO oxidation on the activity of human and rat platelet guanylate cyclase were studied. 3 types of nitroso complexes were used: (1) NO group carries a positive charge--a nitrosonium cation (Na2[FeNO + (CN)5]-nitroprusside); (2) NO is neutral--(K3[CrNO(CN)5 and [CoNO(NH3)5]SO4) and (3) NO is coordinated as anion NO- (K3[CoNO-(CN)5]. It is shown that the highest stimulatory effect is produced by sodium nitroprusside, whose activating action is due to the interaction of its NO group with the guanylate cyclase heme. Nitroso complexes (Co and Cr) the NO group of which is neutral stimulated guanylate cyclase activity insignificantly and this activation was not guanylate cyclase heme directed. Nitroso complex (Co) with NO coordinated as anion NO(-)--is a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. In contrast to nitroprusside, the nitroso complexes used (Co and Cr) have no hypotensive effect. It was concluded that the essential requirement for the realization of the hypotensive effect of transition metals' nitroso complexes is the ability of these compounds to activate soluble guanylate cyclase solely by the heme-dependent mechanism.\n\nNobiletin, a citrus flavonoid, activates vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in human platelets through non-cyclic nucleotide-related mechanisms.\n\nPubMed\n\nJayakumar, Thanasekaran; Lin, Kao-Chang; Lu, Wan-Jung; Lin, Chia-Ying; Pitchairaj, Geraldine; Li, Jiun-Yi; Sheu, Joen-Rong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNobiletin, a bioactive polymethoxylated flavone, has been described to possess a diversity of biological effects through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteinÂ (VASP) is a common substrate for cyclicÂ AMP and cyclicÂ GMP-regulated protein kinasesÂ [i.e.,Â cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinaseÂ (PKA; also known as protein kinaseÂ A) and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinaseÂ (PKG; also known as protein kinaseÂ G)] and it has been shown to be directly phosphorylated by protein kinaseÂ CÂ (PKC). In the present study, we demonstrate that VASP is phosphorylated by nobiletin in human platelets via a non-cyclic nucleotide-related mechanism. This was confirmed by the use of inhibitors of adenylate cyclaseÂ (SQ22536) and guanylate cyclaseÂ [1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-oneÂ (ODQ)], since they prevented VASP phosphorylation induced by nobiletin. Furthormore, this event was also not affected by specific inhibitors of PKAÂ (H-89), PKGÂ (KT5823) and PKCÂ (Ro318220), representing cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways upon nobiletin-induced VASP phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibitors of p38Â mitogen-activated protein kinaseÂ (MAPK; SB203580), extracellular signal-regulated kinaseÂ 2Â (ERK2; PD98059), c-Jun N-terminal kinaseÂ 1Â (JNK1; SP600125), AktÂ (LY294002) and nuclear factor-ÎºBÂ (NF-ÎºB; Bay11-7082) did not affect nobiletinâinduced VASP phosphorylation. Moreover, electron spin resonance, dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and western blotting techniques revealed that nobiletin did not affect hydroxyl radicalsÂ (OHâ¢), intracellular reactive oxygen speciesÂ (ROS) and on protein carbonylation, respectively. Furthermore, the nobiletinâinduced VASP phosphorylation was surprisingly reversed by the intracellular antioxidant, N-acetylcysteineÂ (NAC), but not by the inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, diphenyleneiodonium chlorideÂ (DPI). It was surprising to observe the differential effects of nobiletin and NAC on VASP\n\nGlucose and cyclic adenosine monophosphate stimulate activities of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase of Tetrahymena pyriformis infusoria.\n\nPubMed\n\nShpakov, A O; Derkach, K V; Uspenskaya, Z I\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe sensitivities of cyclase enzymes adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase to glucose and extracellular cAMP were studied in Tetrahymena pyriformis infusoria.

Frequently, the chemotactic activity of cytokines depends on a modified N-terminus of the polypeptide. Among those, the N-terminus of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2 and MCP-1) is modified to a pyroglutamate (pE-) residue protecting against degradation in vivo. Here, we show that the N-terminal pE-formation depends on glutaminyl cyclase activity. The pE-residue increases stability against N-terminal degradation by aminopeptidases and improves receptor activation and signal transduction in vitro. Genetic ablation of the glutaminyl cyclase iso-enzymes QC (QPCT) or isoQC (QPCTL) revealed a major role of isoQC for pE1-CCL2 formation and monocyte infiltration. Consistently, administration of QC-inhibitors in inflammatory models, such as thioglycollate-induced peritonitis reduced monocyte infiltration. The pharmacologic efficacy of QC/isoQC-inhibition was assessed in accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE3*Leiden mice, showing attenuated atherosclerotic pathology following chronic oral treatment. Current strategies targeting CCL2 are mainly based on antibodies or spiegelmers. The application of small, orally available inhibitors of glutaminyl cyclases represents an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat CCL2-driven disorders such as atherosclerosis/restenosis and fibrosis.

In addition, these results, coupled with earlier findings on the capacity of D-LSD to interact with serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems from rat brain23,24 and other neural systems16, strongly suggest that this hallucinogenic agent is capable of acting as an agonist at central dopamine and serotonin receptors, as well as functioning as an antagonist at dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors in the brain.\n\nActivation of GPR4 by Acidosis Increases Endothelial Cell Adhesion through the cAMP/Epac Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeffler, Nancy R.; Asch, Adam S.; Witte, Owen N.; Yang, Li V.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nEndothelium-leukocyte interaction is critical for inflammatory responses.

Using molecular, cellular and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that activation of GPR4, a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, by isocapnic acidosis increases the adhesiveness of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that express GPR4 endogenously. Acidosis in combination with GPR4 overexpression further augments HUVEC adhesion with U937 monocytes. In contrast, overexpression of a G protein signaling-defective DRY motif mutant (R115A) of GPR4 does not elicit any increase of HUVEC adhesion, indicating the requirement of G protein signaling. Downregulation of GPR4 expression by RNA interference reduces the acidosis-induced HUVEC adhesion. To delineate downstream pathways, we show that inhibition of adenylate cyclase by inhibitors, 2â²,5â²-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) or SQ 22536, attenuates acidosis/GPR4-induced HUVEC adhesion. Consistently, treatment with a cAMP analog or a Gi signaling inhibitor increases HUVEC adhesiveness, suggesting a role of the Gs/cAMP signaling in this process. We further show that the cAMP downstream effector Epac is important for acidosis/GPR4-induced cell adhesion. Moreover, activation of GPR4 by acidosis increases the expression of vascular adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which are functionally involved in acidosis/GPR4-mediated HUVEC adhesion. Similarly, hypercapnic acidosis can also activate GPR4 to stimulate HUVEC adhesion molecule expression and adhesiveness. These results suggest that acidosis/GPR4 signaling regulates endothelial cell adhesion mainly through the Gs/cAMP/Epac pathway and may play a role in the inflammatory response of vascular endothelial cells.

These statins (i.e., simvastatin) may exert other effects besides from their cholesterol-lowering actions, including inhibition of platelet activation. Platelet activation is relevant to a variety of coronary heart diseases. Although the inhibitory effect of simvastatin in platelet activation has been studied; the detailed signal transductions by which simvastatin inhibit platelet activation has not yet been completely resolved. Methods The aim of this study was to systematically examine the detailed mechanisms of simvastatin in preventing platelet activation. Platelet aggregation, flow cytometric analysis, immunoblotting, and electron spin resonance studies were used to assess the antiplatelet activity of simvastatin. Results Simvastatin (20-50 Î¼M) exhibited more-potent activity of inhibiting platelet aggregation stimulated by collagen than other agonists (i.e., thrombin). Simvastatin inhibited collagen-stimulated platelet activation accompanied by [Ca2+]i mobilization, thromboxane A2 (TxA2) formation, and phospholipase C (PLC)Î³2, protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (i.e., p38 MAPK, JNKs) phosphorylation in washed platelets. Simvastatin obviously increased both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels. Simvastatin markedly increased NO release, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. SQ22536, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, markedly reversed the simvastatin-mediated inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation, PLCÎ³2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and simvastatin-mediated stimulatory effects on VASP and eNOS phosphorylation. Conclusion The most important findings of this study demonstrate for the first time that inhibitory effect of simvastatin in platelet activation may involve activation of the cyclic AMP\n\nSignal Transduction Triggered by Iron to Induce the Nuclear Importation of a Myb3 Transcription Factor in the Parasitic Protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHsu, Hong-Ming; Lee, Yu; Hsu, Pang-Hung; Liu, Hsing-Wei; Chu, Chien-Hsin; Chou, Ya-Wen; Chen, Yet-Ran; Chen, Shu-Hui; Tai, Jung-Hsiang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIron was previously shown to induce rapid nuclear translocation of a Myb3 transcription factor in the protozoan parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis. In the present study, iron was found to induce a transient increase in cellular cAMP, followed by the nuclear influx of Myb3, whereas the latter was also induced by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. Iron-inducible cAMP production and nuclear influx of Myb3 were inhibited by suramin and SQ22536, respective inhibitors of the GÎ± subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and adenylyl cyclases. In contrast, the nuclear influx of Myb3 induced by iron or 8-bromo-cAMP was delayed or inhibited, respectively, by H89, the inhibitor of protein kinase A. Using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry, Thr156 and Lys143 in Myb3 were found to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, respectively. These modifications were induced by iron and inhibited by H89, as shown by immunoprecipitation-coupled Western blotting. Iron-inducible ubiquitination and nuclear influx were aborted in T156A and K143R, but T156D was constitutively ubiquitinated and persistently localized to the nucleus. Myb3 was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of a T. vaginalis protein kinase A, TvPKAc. A transient interaction between TvPKAc and Myb3 and the phosphorylation of both proteins were induced in the parasite shortly after iron or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment. Together, these observations suggest that iron may induce production of cAMP and activation of TvPKAc, which then induces the phosphorylation of Myb3 and subsequent ubiquitination for accelerated nuclear influx. It is conceivable that iron probably exerts a much broader impact on the physiology of the parasite than previously thought to encounter environmental changes.

M.\n\n1996-01-01\n\n1. The nature of the receptor coupling mechanism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 (5-HT4) receptor in the circular smooth muscle of the human colon has been further investigated. 2. 5-HT stimulated cyclic AMP generation and caused a relaxation in a concentration-dependent fashion, with EC50 values of 175.5 and 274.9 nM respectively. DAU 6236 increased cyclic AMP formation and caused a relaxant effect but was a partial agonist relative to 5-HT. 3. The 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, GR 113808, inhibited cyclic AMP formation and relaxation induced by 5-HT with -log Ki values of 9.1 (cyclic AMP) and 8.9 (relaxation) and apparent pA2 values of 9.2 (cyclic AMP) and 9.5 (relaxation). 4. Ondansetron and methysergide failed to inhibit cyclic AMP formation or the relaxation induced by 5-HT. 5. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, produced a concentration-dependent relaxation (EC50 = 30 microM) and at 1 microM it enhanced the 5-HT-induced relaxation producing a leftward shift of the 5-HT concentration-effect curve with a concentration-ratio of 4.1. Rolipram caused a concentration-dependent relaxation (EC50 = 564.8 nM) and at 200 nm caused a leftward shift of the concentration-effect curve to 5-HT with a concentration-ratio of 5.5. 6. Application of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ 22536 (0.1 mM), and the protein kinase inhibitors, H7 (100 nM) and H89 (200 nM), inhibited the relaxant effect of 5-HT inducing a rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve with concentration-ratios of 10.1, 2.7 and 4.2 respectively. 7. Forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP production and caused a relaxation. The maximum relaxant effect of forskolin (6 microM, 13.8 +/- 1.9 cm.s) was not significantly different from the maximum relaxant effect of 5-HT (10 microM, 12.7 +/- 4.9 cm.s). However, the cyclic AMP levels stimulated by forskolin (6 microM, 49.3 +/- 6.6 pmol mg-1) were markedly greater than those stimulated by 5-HT (10 microM, 7.6 +/- 2.0 pmol mg-1). 8.
