Tom Bell is a Radio Forth legend - used to present the Saturday afternoon sports programme - as well as a number of weekday evening programmes in the 1980s.

He's a very talented broadcaster from the old school - and will fit perfectly at Smooth.

Is he still on air at Central FM too?

yeah, Tom's sounding good on air. Dave Marshall is back from hols next week so John Darroch will probably be returning to his evening slot. Tom would be a good addition to the station though, maybe for Dougie Jackson who sounds totally out of place - don't think many Smooth listeners are interested in news about Beyonce, Pete Docherty, Jordan & the like - more Real than Smooth\

I tuned into Smooth Glasgow last night after reading this thread to listen to Tom Bell.

I used to listen to him on Radio Borders when they took Max AM 1548 (now Forth 2 ) after 7pm. I loved his show then and I was not disappointed last night either.

Tom knows his music very well, in fact when he did the evening show on Max AM, he had a competition called 'Beat the Bell', where you would call in with a song title and he would identify the artist. I beat him on two occasions, but he beat me a lot more than that! What a memory he has!

I wish Tom every success at Smooth - He is a radio pro. I will be listening to him on-line a whole lot more now!

Tom Bell eh...... a Radio Forth heritage presenter that they expect West of Scotland listeners to have an affinity with....

More evidence of GMG plot and lost I think!

Oh for God's sake wavejock!

While I agree with much of what you say, I really must call you on this one

The logic of what you are saying is that the only people GMG can use on Smooth are heritage jocks of old from Radio Clyde.

Yes it helps and yes that is what they have done to a great extent but it isn't the be all and end all.

I had a dip into Tom's show tonight and felt he sounded really comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than he did on Central during it's "Musicfunlife" era. I suspect few if any Smooth listeners would have had cause for complaint.

Tom is a superb broadcaster - so what if he used to be on Radio Forth?!!

He fits the Smooth style like a glove.

Half of the guys on Clyde and Forth today have come from Tay or Northsound - no big deal is it?

Considering he worked at Central, which part of is in Smooth's TSA then surely he has an infinity with some listeners from the West of Scotland.

Added to that the last time he was on Forth was about 10 years ago....

Anyone remember some of Tom's work on Forth in the 80s?

Topside Stateside - a Tuesday evening American chart show

Play It Again Tam - Thursday night request show

Airplay Action - a chart based on UK radio airplay

The Gold Cruiser - Saturday afternoon oldies and sport

Ok, let me get the anorak off now. I'm frightening myself!
