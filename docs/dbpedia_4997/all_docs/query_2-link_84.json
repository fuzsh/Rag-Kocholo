        "text": "Lissy Taylor: Your Girl\n\n(Self Released)\n\nDownload/Streaming\n\nOut Now\n\nFollowing a flurry of summer festival appearances including Truck Festival and the main stage at Y Not Festival, Stoke-on-Trent based alt-rocker Lissy Taylor releases the radiantly catchy new single Your Girl.\n\nLissy continues to showcasing brilliant pop-rock songwriting that evokes both Avril Lavigne and beabadoobee which first brought her to the attention of Louder Than War a couple of years ago with her single Healer.\n\nLatest single, Your Girl, harks back to early 2000s classics while maintaining a breezy, contemporary freshness. The track features a tight, guitar-driven backdrop under Lissy’s charismatic lead vocals, where her smoky, sultry tone glides above the instrumentation, navigating the playful yet empowering lyrics with a summery feel, highlighted by the silky-smooth production of Tayte Nickols.\n\nThe single does a brilliant job of capturing the full-band energy of Lissy’s live shows while maintaining a commercial edge, particularly through its infectious chorus. It’s a brilliant example of what Lissy is capable of.\n\nThematically, Your Girl explores independence and empowerment, celebrating single life. Lissy explains: “I wrote it after a breakup, thinking, yes, I could be your girl, but I can be anything. I really wanted to capture the confidence and empowerment of being single.”\n\nLissy Taylor, a regular on Louder Than War Radio, has already earned numerous accolades, including a recent win at Manchester City FC’s Battle Of The Bands—an achievement that John Kennedy jokingly remarked made her “the best artist in Manchester” while introducing her at Truck Festival. With more music on the horizon, Lissy is poised for a big second half of 2024.\n\nFind Lissy on Facebook, X/Twitter and Instagram\n\nAll words by Simon Lucas-Hughes.
