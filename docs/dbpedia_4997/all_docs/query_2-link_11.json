        "text": "The Glasgow Magistrate Wrapper is one of our customers' favorite fronto leaves. Some customers are drawn to the Glasgow Magistrate’s thin veins, and others love its smooth and versatile aroma. It’s a premier quality, medium-color leaf with a rich texture and nice oil and stretch making it one of the best cigar leaves available. This leaf comes from Pennsylvania and is hand sorted by Amish farmers after being air cured.\n\nAir cured tobacco is generally cured in open or exposed barns for one to two months at a time. Thanks to this curing process, these leaves have a distinctive, pleasing aroma. Traditionally, this fronto leaf is a 'dark air cured tobacco' used universally as a wrapper in cigars. Our particular variety is often used as a substitute for CT Broadleaf, a very popular cigar leaf.\n\nOur Glasgow Magistrate is also frequently used as a binder or filler.\n\nAs with all of our retail sales, these leaves are unbound and separated from each other. If you'd prefer your fronto leaf order to be untouched and bound together in 'hands' by the farmer, we're happy to accommodate you. Just let us know. Large and wholesale orders are shipped in bound 'hands' of tobacco.\n\nType: Dark Air Cured\n\nOrigin: Pennsylvania\n\nGrade: Wrapper\n\nAverage length: 23\" long, not including the unusable length of the stem at the bottom of each leaf\n\nAverage width: 10\" at its widest point"
