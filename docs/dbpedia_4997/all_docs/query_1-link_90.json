        "text": "Hamilton, Bermuda, October 5, 2010 — Bacardi Limited, the largest privately held spirits company in the world, today announced the initial phase of its US$250 million dollar investment in Scotch whisky production has been completed. This investment is to meet growing demand for the premium portfolio of Dewar’s Scotch whiskies, which are among the top-selling, favorite and most awarded Scotches in the world.\n\n“Demand for Dewar’s Scotch whiskies has grown significantly in the United States, Asia and other emerging markets and we are excited to have completed the first phase of a new infrastructure project to support higher inventories of maturing whisky and increase our blending, bottling and packing capabilities,” said Séamus McBride, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bacardi Limited.\n\nDewar’s has undertaken a comprehensive redevelopment of an existing site in Parkhead, Glasgow, and has built five new maturation warehouses and a new blend center, as well as installed new bottling lines and packing equipment. The Dewar’s expansion project, which started in July 2007 and was one of the most significant investments ever in the Scotch industry at the time, will be completed in phases over ten years.\n\nThe Company also purchased more than 100 acres in central Scotland and developed a second maturation facility including six warehouses where Dewar’s ages whisky for flavor and smoothness. Three more aging warehouses are currently under construction and a blending facility will be built next year.\n\nBacardi environmental commitment to Scotland\n\nAs the Dewar’s business expands, the Company has an increasing commitment to protect and sustain the Scottish environment. “We believe the quality of Dewar’s fine whiskies are directly linked to the quality of Scotland’s natural elements,” said Iain Lochhead, operations director of John Dewar’s & Sons Ltd. “From Scotland’s clean air, pristine water and fine grain comes this great product. We take the original meaning of whisky — “water of life” — to heart from the natural ingredients in the environment to the final product.”\n\nDewar’s has planted close to 100,000 indigenous trees including birch, rowan oak and beech to naturally enhance its new maturation facility in central Scotland and complement the surrounding landscape. Another 40,000 more trees will be planted over the next three years. Careful planning was taken for both construction and tree planting to not interfere with bird nesting seasons.\n\n“We are extremely proud that our Scotch whisky distilleries have played a key role in protecting the environment,” said Jon Grey, Senior Vice President of Global Operations Group for Bacardi.\n\nEnvironmental efficiencies\n\nOverall, efficiencies in Dewar’s Scotch production have resulted in energy savings, and usage is down by 11% in distilleries over the past three years. Since fiscal year 2009, water usage has been cut by 17.5 percent, resulting in a savings equivalent to 300 Olympic swimming pools every year.\n\nReturning water back to nature is important as well. At its Aberfeldy distillery, which produces the award-winning single malt at the heart of the Dewar’s blends, treated leftover water is cleaned by passing through a reed bed, an innovative natural filtration process to flow into the River Tay, famed for its salmon and trout fishing.\n\nIn addition, the design and construction of the new facilities was undertaken by local suppliers and the vast majority of malted barley, yeast and packaging materials including glass, caps and cases are purchased locally to reduce “road miles” and cut carbon emission impacts.\n\nAnother sign of its move into the future, Dewar’s recently unveiled a new modern, bold and cohesive look and package design, visually linking its portfolio of premium blended and single malt Scotch whiskies. The Dewar’s portfolio includes DEWAR’S® WHITE LABEL®, DEWAR’S® 12 YEAR OLD, DEWAR’S ®15 YEAR OLD, DEWAR’S® 18 YEAR OLD, DEWAR’S SIGNATURE™ AND ABERFELDY® SINGLE MALT—12 AND 21 YEARS. The new design with its smooth curves and tempting colors emphasizes the artistry and craftsmanship that has defined the Dewar’s brand since 1846 and provides a window into the superior spirit inside.\n\nThe growing demand for Dewar’s has also led to an increase in visitors at the Dewar’s World of Whisky™, in Aberfeldy, one of the premier visitor centers in the world since it opened in 2000. This center has been voted “the ultimate distillery visitor center” by Whisky Magazine and is rated a five-star tourist attraction in Scotland.\n\n###\n\nAbout DEWAR’S® Blended Scotch Whiskies\n\nThe name of DEWAR’S® is one of the most respected in the world of blended Scotch whisky. Founded in 1846 by John Dewar Sr., quality and innovation are fundamental to the story of DEWAR’S. DEWAR’S blended Scotch whiskies have been awarded more than 200 medals along with awards at competitive tastings across the globe, providing a guarantee of the quality of the whisky. Today, DEWAR’S is one of the largest whisky brands in the world, and the top-selling blended Scotch whisky in the United States.\n\nThe complete DEWAR’S portfolio of blended Scotch whiskies includes: DEWAR’S® WHITE LABEL®, first crafted in 1899 and the flagship of the DEWAR’S portfolio; DEWAR’S® 12 Year-Old; DEWAR’S® 18 Year-Old and DEWAR’S SIGNATURE®, the ultimate expression of blended Scotch whisky.

Bacardi, through its John Dewar & Sons Ltd. subsidiary, employs 300 people at seven locations throughout Scotland. The Company currently operates whisky distilleries in Aberfeldy, Macduff, Aultmore, Craigellachie and Royal Brackla with blending, bottling and packaging facilities in Glasgow and maturation facilities in Poniel in Central Scotland.\n\nAbout Bacardi Limited\n\nBacardi Limited is the largest privately held spirits company in the world and produces and markets a variety of internationally-recognized spirits and wines.
