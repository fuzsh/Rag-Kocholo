        "text": "3D Milling & Paving\n\nWe outfit our milling and paving machines with 3D devices also known as Automated Machine Guidance technology (AMG). These control the vertical position of a machine’s components and will automatically adjust elevation and slope to match exact specifications of any project—resulting in less wasted material, more cost savings, and better accuracy of the final product.\n\n3D milling is especially important for ensuring overall surface smoothness. Milling at a uniform depth helps to eliminate flaws on the base level, creating an even foundation for paving crews to build on. Scotty’s surfaces are consistently within millimeters of design specifications.\n\nLarge-Scale Capacity\n\nScotty’s asphalt paving teams run year-round on projects of all sizes and scopes, from small parking lot restoration projects to large-scale civil construction improvements. Our depth of resources allows our paving operations to be responsive to the needs of Kentucky’s citizens and communities, mobilizing quickly to perform work when it’s needed most.\n\nOur paving equipment fleet consists of more than 160+ pieces of state-of-the-art heavy equipment, and our network of 13 asphalt plants allows us to streamline delivery of high-quality asphalt to jobsites throughout Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nVertical Integration\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in asphalt paving isn’t the paving itself but the logistics involved in transporting hot-mix when needed and maintaining the correct temperature of the product for placement. Late delivery of asphalt, or delivery before a paving crew is ready for laydown, can result in wasted material and production delays that impact profitability.\n\nScotty’s manages those challenges by controlling the complete supply chain—from aggregate mining to asphalt production, delivery to paving. Our teams communicate with each other closely to avoid surprises and collectively respond and adjust to unexpected changes in plan. The result is less wasted product, paved on time, every time."
