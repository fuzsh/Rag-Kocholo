More people have hair permanently removed by electrolysis than you might imagine.\n\nAdvanced Electrolysis can also alleviate many skin conditions >\n\nPlease make an appointment for your Consultation;\n\nit is confidential and you are under no obligation to have treatment.\n\nThe treatment is approved by the medical profession and you should confirm:\n\n(a) That your electrolysist uses sterile disposable probes, which are recommended by the Public Health Laboratory Service. You should have a brand new probe for each treatment.\n\n(b) That your electrolysist is fully-qualified and preferably a registered member of the British Institute & Association of Electrolysis – don’t be afraid to ask to see a certificate.\n\nThis can vary greatly depending upon the individual. Some people may need only a short treatment every 6 – 8 weeks, while others may need to attend on a weekly basis initially.\n\nPrices range from £29 for a 15 minute appointment to £79 for one hour. An average lip and chin area would require about half an hour to clear the hair which would cost £49. At the time of consultation, the electrolysist will give you a more accurate assessment as to the cost involved.\n\nRemember, having a consultation puts you under no pressure to go ahead with treatment.\n\nA 15 minute appointment includes up to 10 minutes of treatment. A 30 minute appointment includes up to 25 minutes of treatment and so on.\n\nScroll down to see our Electrolysis Price List below."
