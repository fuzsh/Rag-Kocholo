This new production sees Wilde’s genius humour meet contemporary culture in a theatrical rollercoaster packed with shade, wit and vibrant characters.\n\nView Event →\n\nHenry IV\n\nAdapted from Henry IV Parts 1 & 2, just four actors play out Shakespeare’s great historical and personal drama, bringing this powerful story and its vivid characters to life in the magnificent surroundings of the Kibble Palace Glasshouse.\n\nView Event →\n\nJulius Caesar\n\nBard in the Botanics opens our summer season with a new version of Shakespeare’s electrifying political thriller, as terrifyingly relevant today as it has ever been\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Tempest\n\nIn this new version of Shakespeare’s final play, The Tempest, past and present, reality and fantasy collide in a hauntingly beautiful story of love, loss and learning to let go.\n\nView Event →\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\nShakespeare’s warmest & wittiest comedy gets a thoroughly modern makeover as two of his best-loved characters are reinvented as Benedick & Bertram and the original romcom is given a 21st century twist.\n\nView Event →\n\nMedea\n\nBard in the Botanics are proud to produce this thrilling Greek tragedy in a powerful new version of Medea by Kathy McKean, with award-winning actor, Nicole Cooper, in the title role.\n\nView Event →\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream\n\nBard in the Botanics is thrilled to present a brand new production of Shakespeare’s most marvellous and magical play.

Their all-consuming love makes enemies of the establishment, alienates the King’s once-devoted Queen and threatens to tear the kingdom to pieces. A political thriller and an intense love story, Edward II is a powerful exploration of how far society will go to destroy a love seen as taboo.\n\nView Event →\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing fizzes with sparkling wit and romance. Although the path of true love certainly does not run smooth, as the lovers face obstacles both accidental and on purpose, it’s impossible not to be swept along by the original and best romcom.\n\nView Event →\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\n\nThe Roman general and emperor, Mark Antony, neglects his empire for a life of decadent seduction with his mistress, Cleopatra, queen of Egypt.
