        "text": "Today is indeed a time to reflect on my efforts of the past year or - if I was to be brutally honest with myself â possibly, with the lack of them (music business wise, anyway).\n\nI can now see that I allowed myself to become way too involved with my football project, believing that â provided I unearthed the next wonder kid â I may no longer have to rely on the income from my music business work, to sustain myself, in the years to come. How disastrously wrong I was. Thankfully, how fortunate I am to be able to negotiate a quick U-turn and make up for lost time (and income!). That U-turn starts on the 17th January. Wish me well.\n\nIâm actually itching to get started on the serious business of touring with Paul Potts: amongst many obvious advantages (not the least, being financial!) it will keep me from pondering the mistakes of the last eighteen months â and allow me an immediate opportunity to rectify them.\n\nI believed I could change the world of football â maybe I can, at some point in the future, but for the time being I must demote my (wild?) ideas to the back burner and endeavor to return myself to a sound financial footing. Itâs only in the last few days that Iâve truly come to realise how Iâve allowed myself to become so enmeshed in all things football. I was warned you know. Maybe itâs this rock ân roll work ethic of mine that fooled me into thinking I could make a success of anything I set my mind on.\n\nItâs surely impossible that everyone realises their dreams and therefore those of us that donât must be brave enough to stand up and accept it. The crucially important factor here is the timing, of course: but when youâre consumed with a vision, itâs far from easy to know when to quit. Not that Iâm quitting â Iâm just going to stand back from it for a while and try to take a more reasoned view. With hindsight, I should have reached this point twelve months ago.\n\nI would have to admit that my most lucrative period of the last ten years was the three years I spent with Westlife: not only was I so completely immersed in the job, that I had to shelve my football interests: I was also being very well paid for my involvement. The downside of all that, of course, was the fact that I was âfriedâ from almost three years of sixteen hour days. Something had to give â and something eventually did. Me. One day the lads will understand.\n\nThis last week, I have begun to rigorously prepare for a six-month world tour, something Iâve not undertaken for a good few years. Sure it was overly hectic on Westlife, however said activity tended to be confined, mainly, to the UK and Europe. The time between Christmas and New Year is certainly a good time to catch up, as the music business almost closes down.\n\nSo, my resolve is solid: throw myself back into the music business for the next year, at least, while keeping tabs on the football operation, just in case that âgemâ can be unearthed. Iâm sure that there will be many times, in the coming months, where I will be reminded that Iâve definitely made the right decision. Thereâs still a lot of things that I want to do in this life, but first I must rectify the error of my ways. Slowly, I feel the realization of the need to do something markedly meaningful with my life: but, I wonder, what? The best to you all for 2008.\n\nAlthough these diary entries are, technically, meant to detail the events in my life, based on the previous seven days (Monday through Sunday), I should mention that â having completed last weekâs entry on the Sunday morning flight back from Helsinki â who should I bump into at Heathrow airport, when I landed in London? None other than Nicky Byrneâs parents!\n\nIt turns out the Westlife lads had filmed a TV special the previous night in London â and here was Yvonne and Nicky snr, on their way back to Dublin. It was great to see them again: unfortunately Terminal One was overrun with passengers, and we just didnât have as much time to speak, as I would have liked. Even with an e-ticket to hand, it took me over an hour to check in for my flight.\n\nYou will therefore garner from the above that I was able to shoot home to Edinburgh for a day and a half, prior to setting off back down South again on Tuesday, via Leeds, for a Paul Potts tour production meeting at the premises of âProduction Northâ, the company responsible for the set-up and coordination of Paulâs upcoming world tour. Coincidentally, this is also the company (run by my long-time friend, Steve Levitt) that oversees all aspects of Westlifeâs tour co-ordination.\n\nBy the time I reached London on Tuesday evening, it was pushing 7.30 pm, at which point I jumped the Piccadilly line, from London Kings Cross mainline station, to Heathrow airport. Paul and I had an early start the next morning, en-route to Amsterdam, therefore we decided to stay at Terminal 4âs Hilton Hotel, from where it is only a six-minute walk to the Terminal 4 BA check-in. Paul had also managed to zip home for a couple of days, although â as a result of him not being home for almost a month â he did not expect to be able to relax for much of that time.\n\nAs luck would (wouldnât) have it, our flight into Amsterdam was delayed by over an hour, putting paid the opportunity to be able to swing by the hotel, upon arrival in Holland: instead the cars that met us upon arrival whisked us directly to the TV studio complex at Hilversum. When it comes to TV promotional work in Holland nowadays, most of it is centred around Hilversum. First up was a midday chat and appearance on the âMax and Lorretaâ daytime television show, followed by a lunch break and then a mid-afternoon recording for the popular âJensen!â TV show, due to be aired later that evening. In between times Paul made a brief appearance on the RTL lunchtime TV programme, where he was presented with a commemorative plaque, recognizing his âgoldâ Dutch record sales.\n\nNext day, Thursday, we filmed a five-song live appearance at Amsterdamâs quaint âFelix Meritisâ venue, in the city centre, in front of a small, invited, audience. With the requirement to rehearse the show during the afternoon, for the purposes of sound, camera angles, orchestra balance, etc, we didnât finish until around six oâclock that evening. It just so happened that Sony/BMG, Holland were holding their Christmas dinner that same evening, therefore Paul and I kindly accepted the record companyâs kind invitation to join their celebrations for the evening.\n\nFridayâs return flight (for a change!) was at the civil hour of 11.50 am, which put us back into the London office in time for me to meet with Paulâs management to discuss various tour matters. Being stuck there until after 8.00 pm, I had little choice but to book the overnight train from Euston to Edinburgh, arriving back in just enough time to have breakfast with my children! Cheers.\n\nHa! Itâs all coming back to me know â just how physically punishing these promotional campaigns can be: of course, having endured a couple of years of it with âWestlifeâ, at least I have a fair idea of what Iâm got myself into. This past week has been a whirlwind of activity. Read on.\n\nOn Monday, Paul recorded his performance on the Royal Variety show, which is due to be aired early next week. A glittering array of talent squeezed into the Liverpool Empire: everything from a marching band, to a full dance troupe, to Bon Jovi, to Katherine Jenkinson, to performers on stilts â and of course Paul himself, supported by a full live orchestra and choir.\n\nItâs rare that I tread even close to the risquÃ© (in fact, Iâm not even sure itâs risquÃ© â Iâm just âwarmedâ by the observation) but what is it about a fine looking woman in full flow on the cello?! Maybe some of my more seasoned female readers could offer an opinion on that (come on Colleen, youâll have something to say about this â you Americans are never backward at coming forwards!!).\n\nOn Westlife, during the âAllow us to be Frankâ album campaign, we used string players on several occasions and one particular lady (yes, a cello player) called Rosie occasionally, fleetingly, darts across my consciousness: a most engaging woman with a vibrant stroke. Whooa! Where is she now?\n\nRight, back to the purpose in hand: the after show party, for the Royal Variety show on Monday night, was staged in the most grand St. Georges Hall, just across the street from the Liverpool Empire. As part of the aprÃ¨s-show entertainment there was a short, yet impressive, set from another Artist of the Modest Management stable â the irrepressible Ray Quinn. What a decent lad and what a consummate performer. Iâm sure he will be around for a good while to come yet.\n\nIâm sure I would have hung around the after show party for a while longer, had it not been for the thought of the 07.00 am Easyjet flight that Paul and I were booked on the following morning to Barcelona (ah, once again, proof that this business is not as glamorous as itâs cracked up to be). Once our commitment to the recording of the TV show was completed on Tuesday evening, we headed straight out to the airport to catch the last flight to Madrid, to enable Paul to appear on one of the highest rated morning TV shows in Spain. Once we were âclearedâ at midday, it was back to the provincial airport to catch a private jet back to the UK (a bit of glamour for you there!) as this was the only feasible way to make it back for the Alan Titchmarsh show at the BBC.\n\nOn Thursday Paul paid a visit to Downing Street and actually met up the Prime Minister himself, Mr. Gordon Brown. Friday was spent based in London, firstly with Paul undertaking a comprehensive array of âphonerâ interviews, in relation to the UK segment of next yearâs tour. On Friday evening Paul then took part in a live Radio 2 programme, from the Mermaid theatre, hosted by the ever-young Aled Jones and featuring the young operatic quartet âTeatroâ.\n\nYesterday (Saturday) saw us board an early flight to Oslo, where Paul staged a performance in a very cool art gallery, just off the centre of town. Again, the after show festivities indeed looked inviting however, with a flight time this morning of 08.30 am, I decided to save myself for a time when I can steal a âlie inâ the next morning. What a week that was, indeed. Bring on the next one!\n\nAdmittedly, Iâve fallen behind with the last couple of my diary entries: however, I believe, I have reasonable cause for incurring this state of affairs. Allow me to explain.\n\nAs I disclosed in last weekâs entry (25th Nov.), Iâve landed the Tour Management of the opera singer, Paul Potts: infamous for having entered the revered world of opera, as a result of winning the UK âBritainâs Got Talentâ TV programme, earlier this year.\n\nPaulâs world tour commences in the UK on 17th January next year and winds itâs way across four continents and (at the last count) sixteen countries, up until mid July.\n\nCurrently, Paul is approaching the final stage of an exhaustive promotional campaign that has taken in almost as many â if not more â countries that the upcoming world tour will involve. However, as a result of his Promotions Manager having to honour a prior commitment, Paulâs management asked if I would be willing to undertake the last three weeks of his promotional campaign, centered around the UK and continental Europe. How could I refuse?\n\nNot only does this give me the opportunity to meet and work with Paul before the tour, it also sees me earn a few shillings during December â a possibility that I had given up hope for, particularly as I was committed to Paulâs touring project from mid January onwards.\n\nHaving only received the call to check on my availability for the promotional work on Tuesday of âthisâ week (27th Dec.), I quickly found myself boarding the last flight down from Edinburgh on Thursday evening, in preparation for an early start to the remaining promotional commitments, the following Friday morning.\n\nOur first task of the day was a filmed visit to the worldly-renowned Harrodâs store in London, as part of a GMTV programme feature, where Paul, and his wife Julie-Ann, enjoyed a reasonably leisurely stroll through several of the storeâs comprehensively stocked departments. Who â irrespective of age (be honest here, now!) can resist the lure of the toy department, particularly vibrant during the lead up to Christmas â and of course, Harrods being Harrods, you need look no further even for the most demanding of childlike imagination.\n\nThe remainder of our day consisted of a visit to the tailors (for a last minute check on Paulâs tuxedo suit that he would wear for the Royal Variety Show performance) followed by a Daily Mail interview â a 2-page spread since published â and several other print-related items of promotion.\n\nOn Saturday we traveled up (firstly) to Liverpool for rehearsals for the Royal Variety Show, after which, in the late afternoon, we transferred to Granada Studios in Manchester for a quick rehearsal for a guest appearance on the Sunday morningâs Lesley Garret show. Oh, Jakey boy was quite taken with Ms (Mrs? â damn!]) Garrett. The show featured a memorable duet with Paul and Lesley on the Christmas song âSilent Nightâ, after which, mid-morning Sunday, it was back through to Liverpool in preparation for the recording of the next dayâs Royal Variety Performance. Have you caught your breath yet? Stand by for a whirlwind six months: weâre back on the road! See ya.\n\nNovember\n\nEvening all (and let the record show that it is indeed Sunday evening â thereâs no knowing what feats of organization I will aspire to next). Not a bad week, for a couple of good reasonsâ¦\n\nFirstly, I now believe it is an appropriate time to divulge my next, upcoming, touring involvement: although it is something of a departure from mainstream rock ân roll (the mainstay of my work for the past thirty years) it is nevertheless an interesting challenge, from several aspects. First off, let me tell you that I will be working with Paul Potts, the opera singer.\n\nNow, before we go any further, there may be some of my non-UK readers who are not immediately familiar with the identity of Paul Potts. For a brief insight to the unmistakable talent (and incredible voice) of the man, then jump onto the âYou Tubeâ website and marvel at his winning performance on the recent UK prime-time television show, âBritainâs Got Talentâ.\n\nPaul has since released a debut album (âOne Chanceâ) and he is presently involved in a busy promotional campaign, both to promote said album and also to highlight the upcoming World Tour â and, yes, thatâs where Jakey boy enters the proceedings. Regular British readers of this column â who are partial to a bit of opera â may be aware that Paulâs UK tour (mid January until mid February) is already on sale and doing very nicely, thank you.\n\nOnce the UK phase has been completed, weâre off around the world to tour several other territories (as we sometimes refer to other countries/continents, in the music business) the details of which I will share with you once they have been publicly announced as going on sale.\n\nThere is certainly something challenging about being involved in a new artistâs initial touring project: one certainly has a real and tangible opportunity to assist in developing the awareness of the act. âOn the Roadâ opera performances are certainly a niche market and Paul can look forward to the exciting opportunity to establish himself on such a unique circuit - with the prospect of many more world tours to follow, down the years. Hopefully, I can play my part.\n\nSo, more information to follow on my involvement with Paul, over the coming weeks. As always, with any artist(s) that I work with, who are mentioned within the confines of my diary, this information is imparted on a âpastâ basis, as confidentiality (as Iâve stressed on many occasions) is everything in this business. However, you will be able to accompany me along the touring highway and hopefully garner a fairly unique perspective of life on the road, in the world of opera.\n\nJust to jump subjects for the moment, I have to mention the full-game debut of my Moroccan midfielder (Mehdi Taouil) for the Scottish Premier club Kilmarnock FC, yesterday. Although they were beaten 1-0 by a very in-form Motherwell FC side, Mehdi gave an impressive showing on his first full ninety minutes for the club: so much so that he was featured as part of the âTeam of the Weekâ in one of the two most popular Scottish Sunday newspapers!\n\nCanât be bad, huh? I know Iâm a fair way off considering early career retirement off the back of my football business but, hey, letâs take it while itâs going! Folks â as they say â itâs been real. BFN\n\nJust read briefly through last weekâs diary entry and realized, upon reflection, that I may have dragged the subject matter out a little. Having said that, we should all â certainly those belonging to my generation - take a little time, now and then, to be thankful that we have been spared having to live through such war-torn times.\n\nNow, depending upon how much of an interest you take in international football, you may â or may not â be aware that Scotlandâs European Championship dreams are over â and by the cruelest of refereeing decisions: having managed to claw back Italyâs very early one-goal lead, and sitting at 1-1 with under two minutes of injury time left, the Italians managed to score a goal from a âset pieceâ, awarded for a foul that never was. How heartbreaking. How typical.\n\nFrom elation to deflation, in the space of twenty-five minutes. Of course, had the game finished at 1 -1, we would still have required Ukraine to beat France, to ensure qualification for Scotland. However, far more importantly, it would have kept the dream alive â and, yes, when it comes to football aspirations, we Scots are the champion dreamers. Alas, weâre out.\n\nBeverley and I watched the game on the big screens yesterday at the Corn Exchange complex in Edinburgh (the same venue for one of the âJamesâ shows, a few of months back). The place was of course packed, and the atmosphere one of vibrancy and (misplaced?) anticipation. âI was thinking of putting a bet on Italyâ announced Beverley as we made our way onto the premises. âThat, my dearâ I advised her âis a thought best kept to yourself for the next two hours, particularly in the company that weâre about to keepâ. When Scotland equalised, we were showered, good naturedly, in a torrent of beer, as a result of a couple of exuberant, kilted, fans behind us throwing their arms (and drinks) to the ceiling. Short lived, Iâm afraid.\n\nSo, here we are today, in time-honoured Scottish football fan fashion: licking our wounds and wondering what might have been. In viewing the bigger picture, Scotland deserve a huge amount of respect for having achieved so much success in their qualifying section: beating France home and away is no mean feat, in addition to several other notable results. Next up of course is the 2010 World Cup, the finals of which will be staged in South Africa. That will also be a tough call to reach the final stages, however we must believe that our international standing has come on by leaps and bounds â and you just never know â¦\n\nOn the touring front, Iâm fairly confident of my involvement in a lengthy project (6+ months) that is due to commence the middle of January in the UK, and then off around the world for the next five months. I know Iâve been holding off making any sort of âannouncementâ about this particular tour, however â for some odd reason known probably only to myself â I just felt it would be better to hold off until the first week in December, before saying anything.\n\nNaturally, I would like to be starting the afore-mentioned project within the coming weeks, however Iâll just have to cool my heels for a while. Thankfully, thereâs plenty for me to be getting on with in terms of my football involvement, however Iâm definitely eagerly anticipating a return to touring work â if only because the Diary will live up to itâs name. BFN\n\nRemembrance Day here in the UK, although â much as we grapple to understand what really went on back there â how can my generation possibly relate to the enormity of it.\n\nNot as a result of any great feat of concerted planning on my part, I happen to have watched three very poignant movies in the last month or so. The first one was âFlags of my Fathersâ, the Clint Eastwood directed epic of the battle to capture the strategic island of Iwo Jima, towards the latter half of World War 2. Amazingly, he produced a âmirror-imageâ film (if Clint will forgive that expression) called âLetters from Iwo Jimaâ to illustrate the perspective of the same battle, from the Japanese side. You need to check them out. Stunning yet chilling.\n\nMore recently, I watched the film âThe Glory Daysâ which, if I recall correctly, highlighted the involvement of Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian soldiers to aid Franceâs second World war effort. These guys â if correctly portrayed in the movie â did not question their loyalty and responsibility to (as they termed it) the mother country. However, it would appear that they were utilized in the more dangerous and fortified areas of Italy and France â and never really received the proper and fair recognition for their efforts. According to information appended to the credits of the film, there are still issues outstanding regarding their war pensions.\n\nNow, come on, we all have daily frustrations to contend with - but how they pall into insignificance when you try to fathom the frustration of being bureaucratically shafted when you gave everything for your country in such intolerable circumstances. God help them.\n\nThen just the other day, on one of the main television channels, I watched a drama called âMy Son Jackâ the story of Rudyard Kiplingâs fixation with sending his son off to the first World War, where the boy lost his life on the front line, sadly only one day after his eighteenth birthday (his father had knowingly assisted the lad to falsify his proper age).\n\nI often think that I would have done anything back then â had I found myself faced with âgoing over the topâ â to ensure I lived through that, be in feigning death, shooting myself in the foot whatever. Would that be a common view of my generation, I wonder? If so, might it be based upon the (generally) war-free environment in which we have grown up with â and therefore our seriously stubborn resistance towards anything that might threaten such an existence? Were the young men of 1914 much more nationally spirited, to the end that they gave no second thought to rallying to the defense of their country at a moments notice? Does perceived glory (and propaganda fuelled victory) dull the senses of good reason and survival?\n\nIs there anything tangible we can do to properly pay our respects to these men and women for what they did to enable, in some way, peace in our time? This sentiment is particularly difficult to convey in actuality, when the numbers of those who thankfully (luckily?) survived are dwindling at such an alarming rate. That they will soon all be gone is frightening, is it not?\n\nWhile I believe Iâm a decent guy, I would certainly not purport to be of truly religious in any way. Having said that, I thank the Lord that I did not have to endure those times. BFN\n\nApologies that Iâm a couple of days behind with this entry: family matters to attend to.\n\nHowever, nothing dispiriting â quite uplifting in fact: my daughterâs 18th birthday and a time for reflection indeed. Possibly even more so as Jadeâs mum had compiled â as one of her birthday presents â a framed collage of snaps of Jade taken, mainly, during her younger years.\n\nWell, all you parental types, if that sort of thing doesnât tug at the heart strings, then you probably have no heart strings to be tugged. Where have all the years gone â and so quickly.\n\nI woke up late this morning (as a result of re-writing a contract for a player to which I had been alerted) to find the mid-morning sun streaming through all the windows on the south-facing side of the house. Sunshine makes such a positive difference to my demenour: I know Iâve mentioned before that Iâm certainly not the âlie and fryâ type of guy, when it comes to hot weather, I just love the warmth of the sun on my back. I need to plan to move away.\n\nA good friend of mine left today (Sunday) for a couple for weekâs vacation in South Africa, dividing her time while sheâs there between Johannesburg and Cape Town. Probably along with the likes of Vancouver and Perth (Australia!), Cape Town is a city I most definitely find myself at ease with and, consequently, I do believe I could live there for a while.\n\nHowever, this âup and offâ idea of mine is â at this time particularly â much easier said than done: I need to get myself sorted out first back here and then I can put my mind to that. If Iâm honest with myself, it will take me a couple of years from now to get right âback onto my feet againâ, which â as Iâve detailed in a previous version of the diary â involves me bringing my bank account back into the black, selling my property (now is not a great time to do that, in the UK) and then taking up residency in sunnier climes. Who knows? It may just be that having not had a vacation for a while, Iâm just yearning for a couple of weeks of better weather.\n\nThe fact remains, undeniably, that I engineered myself into this position, so Iâm just going to have to engineer my way out of it again. As soon as I am back out on the road, the outlook will certainly become much brighter and much clearer. I occasionally mislead myself into thinking that maybe Iâm due a little bit of luck to extricate me from my present plight, however that is something of a selfish viewpoint as most individuals would give their right arm to have enjoyed just half the luck that I have had in my time. The time has come to make my own luck.\n\nOn the subject of âback on the roadâ, I should finally know this week if the touring project that Iâve made reference to, over the last couple of weeks, is a definite âgoerâ. Not only am I fortunate to earn decent money when Iâm out on the road (although when one divides oneâs daily earnings by sixteen, then plumbers probably have a better hourly rate!), my normal domestic expenses (fuel, house phone, electricity, etc.) are substantially reduced: hence the reason Iâm always claiming that a good few months of solid touring will go a long way to seeing me back onto a even keel, financially. This week I must endeavor to find a few quiet, undisturbed, hours to think things through properly. Where have all the good times gone? BFN\n\nOctober\n\nEvening all. I sense I may have rambled a bit last week, but I was just telling it like it is (was).\n\nI sometimes wonder if I may really have little to say of any real substance, however that has to be balanced off with my inability to just miss a week once in a while. Thatâs hard to do.\n\nWell, in the way of a little hard news, Iâm off to London tomorrow to speak to some people about a project that would require my involvement from the middle of December onwards: again, canât divulge too much about it (you never know whoâs reading this!) however as soon as Iâm in a position to âgo publicâ, youâll here about it here first.\n\nI donât know if I ever mentioned that I live in a 10-house âcul-de-sacâ on the outskirts of Edinburgh: Iâve been at this current address now for over two years, during which time no other house in the cul-de-sac has ever been put up for sale. Until now. The house three up from me has now gone on the market, therefore I will be watching that situation with interest.\n\nIn Scotland, houses are either put up for sale on an âoffers overâ or âfixed priceâ basis. There are merits for both methods, however most owners trying to move their property via the âoffers overâ option will generally look to realize an eventual sale price of 20% over. From the point of view of the buyer, there is a fair risk to âblind biddingâ (having gone to the expense of a survey beforehand) in that once all bids are opened on the pre-agreed closing date, a fellow bidder has beaten you to the punch. Step forward the âfixed priceâ option.\n\nIn the latter respect, you will invariably find that the seller is asking above the market value of the property: the one advantage of this being that once you accept that price, then you know the property is yours â rather than risking waiting (say) another four weeks, until a closing date, only to find you have been outbid and â almost as frustrating â you have to start all over again. There you go: Jakeâs concise guide to selling your house in Scotland.\n\nSo, as I mentioned above, Iâm off to London tomorrow - albeit in a rather roundabout sort of way. As the people Iâm meeting cannot see me until 6.30 pm in Chelsea (and I donât want to stay over in London), Iâm going to drive down from Edinburgh to Crewe station, park the car, take the train from there to Euston - and then reverse the journey tomorrow evening! To most people this would appear to be a horrendously long day â however, I come from the world of horrendously long days so thankfully Iâm able to take the next thirty-six hours in my stride.\n\nThe only slight drawback of the job that Iâm chasing at the moment, is that I canât really get stuck into the work until mid-December: therefore, Iâll be making a few calls â to certain of the record companies that I have worked for before - to check on the possibilities of something short-term, that would tide me over from now until then. Itâs a long shot, but one can but try. Iâm glad Iâm heading back into the music business to undertake a substantial project: as I said last week, itâs time to redress the balance. Football is the income of the future: touring is the income of now â and itâs now I have to deal with. Iâm damned lucky to be able to have a lucrative âday jobâ. It would serve me well to keep that in mind. I intend to. BFN\n\nIâm happy to let you guys in on the plan, because itâs time I had a plan â and this, simply, is it:\n\nTwo years back in the music business to rectify my ailing financial situation and then sell my property in Scotland â and off I go in search of sunnier climes! You heard it here first!\n\nEither that or Iâm off to North America to rent a motor-home for a year and hopefully visit every one of the States. Ever since the children and I embarked upon our first motor-home vacation in 2001, Iâve been smitten by the bug. Itâs just the greatest sense of mobile freedom that Iâve ever experienced â and one day, I very much look forward to experiencing it again. Not sure if the children will venture out with me on the next trip â but you never know.\n\nI have loved â and still love â my involvement in football, however itâs time to stop spending money and start making money. Maybe the football is something that will eventually yield my âpensionâ and therefore (and, boy, I should have realised this a long, long, time ago), for the foreseeable future, I really need to stick to what I know best â namely, the music business.\n\nWith both of my children now at university (Bradley for one more year; Jade just starting a three year course) I have to remember my responsibilities and act accordingly. So, the plan.\n\nAs one gets older one realises that one has less time to rectify mistakes, therefore it follows that I need to invoke âthe planâ most carefully â and when Iâm in the right frame of mind. That latter part is most important and at this juncture Iâm reminded of what a wise man once said: âYou rarely choose what you do next â you only react against the lastâ. Wisdom, indeed.\n\nI shouldnât have ducked out of the touring business for such an extended period, however Iâm on my way back in, confident that once my face is âback in the frameâ, the work will once again flow consistently â then anything I make from the football project will just become a bonus. It then may be that I can attempt to schedule my touring work so that it does not conflict with when the transfer windows are open. Much easier said than done.\n\nOn the job front, I do believe progress is being made, however I once again apologise that I canât say too much about the Artist involved, until things get underway â Iâm sure youâll understand when I finally explain the circumstances. Some days I wonder where my life is really going â and if I actually have any chance of exercising any control over the outcome.\n\nAt least my Moroccan player, Mehdi Taouil, is now signed to the Scottish Premier Division club, Kilmarnock FC, until the next transfer window opens again, in January of 2008. I have great hopes for him and Iâm convinced that once he has a âfew games under his beltâ we may see great things from him. Kilmarnock actually received his clearance papers on Friday afternoon, from the Scottish Football Association, thereby allowing him to take part (albeit for only six minutes!) in Kilmarnockâs game against Falkirk. Iâm continually told that it only takes one good player to turn oneâs agency business around. Will Mehdi (or Thierry Gathuessi at Hibernian) be the one? God knows, Iâve waited long enough. Surely Iâm deserving of it? BFN.\n\nAs is often precipitated by a weird and unexplainable conflict of circumstances (deep, huh?) I found myself pondering this week as to what itâs really all about â life that is.\n\nI realise now that â while my football project has been most rewarding over the past 12+ years - I definitely need to pay more attention to my music business interests. I am well established in the concert touring business and (I believe) have a decent reputation for the ability to effectively manage complex touring projects. So, why donât I stick to it? After all, it is what I know best.\n\nIronically, while I quietly suspect that I have found my niche in the football business (developing young, talented, French players for the UK market), I have reached the point where I have invested too much money in the process. If I were able to ideally manage my time on an annual basis then it would go something like this: December and January based in the UK (to cover the mid-season transfer window); February, time-off; March through June on the road; July and August back in the UK (for the pre-season transfer window) and then September through November back out on the road. Well, thatâs what Iâm working on.\n\nIâve devoted almost the last year to my football project and have honestly found it hard going. Everyone in football continues to struggle to understand why I would choose football over the âglamourâ of concert touring â believe me, thereâs days I ask myself the same questio\n\nAs for the touring project that I may undertake in the near future (and which I made mention of last week), Iâm still waiting to hear from the people involved. However, being that said project does not seriously get underway until the latter end of this year, then â even if my involvement is confirmed â I may have to keep it âunder wrapsâ for a few weeks yet. You know, even though the football project consumes me at times, I still thoroughly enjoy my concert touring work. I continually remind myself how fortunate I am to have one and a half passions.\n\nTypically jumping back and forth between subjects on these pages, let me just briefly mention that my young Moroccan player, Mehdi Taouil, who is currently training with the Premier League team, Kilmarnock, is proving to be a very skilful player. The manager at Kilmarnock, Mr Jim Jefferies, is a shrewd and careful operator, however I suspect he is so far suitably impressed by what he has seen of the player and Iâm therefore hopeful that there may be some business to be done at the club â particularly as there are several first team players currently on the injury list.\n\nFollowing a break in the domestic football calendar yesterday (to allow for the playing of international games) I can look forward next week to the resumption of the Scottish Premier League â maybe even with a new player signed to Kilmarnock! As Mr Sandy Stewart (assistant manager at the Scottish First Division club, St Johnstone) told me many moons ago, âfootball is a day to day businessâ â and how right he was! I just hope Iâve not allowed myself to become too engrossed in the football side of things. However, if I do happen to discover the next Ronaldo tomorrow, my whole outlook will definitely change! Until next week, dear friends â¦\n\nNot to make my overseas readers envious or anything (and â letâs face it â if you were from California, why would you be?) but we âtea-bagsâ here in the UK have enjoyed some decent weather this past week. October rarely graces us with such clear blue skies.\n\nAh, California. You know Iâm convinced that I resided there â or thereabouts â in a past life, so comfortable am I with the lifestyle over there. Now, as youâve probably guessed, Iâm certainly not a âlie and fryâ type of guy: itâs just being able to go out everyday without a coat or heavy jacket on, or just the pleasure of eating outside at ten oâclock in the evening. Boy, I miss that.\n\nWithin five years I definitely plan to be living abroad, at least for six to eight months of the year. Right now thereâs the small matter of getting my head down to some serious work in the music business, in an effort to redress the balance of my overspending on the football project.\n\nOn that note, I spent late Friday afternoon past visiting several key, music-business, contacts in London, one of such meetings definitely pointing towards the possibility of some substantial touring work, from December onwards. Once again, I have to apologise that I cannot divulge any details of what this may involve, until such time as the work is confirmed. Right now, I would say thereâs a fair chance that the project may come to fruition for me, which would mean at least a five to six month involvement with the Artiste in question. There would also be extensive travel involved with this particular project â which wonât do my air miles any harm. The project is the type of all-consuming tour that I need to throw myself into at the moment, particularly as the transfer window is now firmly shut â and will not now re-open until the 1st January 2008. However, if this project happens, there will be no football for me in January!\n\nMuch as I have a passion for the player-representation side of my business, I am but one person - which makes it extremely difficult to compete on any realistic commercial level with âthe big boysâ. I continue to believe that â because I have acted with decency and honesty over the last twelve years Iâve spent in football â reasonably good fortune will find itâs way to me at some point. However, not everyone enjoys the realization of their dreams â and this chilling fact has to be confronted for those of us with occasional ideas way above our station.\n\nWhile I have yet to change the world of football, Iâve had a great time trying to do so. However, I should have realized a long time ago that one should really look to stick to what one does best and resist the belief that â just because one can boast considerable success in a given field of endeavor â one then has the ability to turn their hand successfully to whatever vocation takes their fancy. If you ever feel similarly intended, please call me first for advice!\n\nAs far as the above mentioned work goes, I should be able to confirm if it looks like a âgoerâ, by this time next week: however â and apologies again to my loyal (suffering?) readers â I doubt I would be in a position to name names, for a little while after that, as the main body of the work does not require my day-to-day involvement for a good few weeks yet. Iâll say it again: Iâm lucky to have another line of work that enables me to re-balance my books, in terms of my over-expenditure on the football side of things. Iâll know better in the next life!? BFN.\n\nSeptember\n\nThere I was â for a couple of weeks anyway - doing impressively well with my weekly diary entries and managing to actually write them on the Sunday to which each one pertained.\n\nHowever, as my regular readers (regular? Am I kidding myself maybe?) have no doubt suspected, over the last couple of weeks, Iâm slipping back to my old, delinquent, ways. Letâs just say that, as I sit here hastily catching up, today is certainly not a Sunday!\n\nSo, what news? Not a whole lot honestly, on the touring front anyway. I may have mentioned, earlier this month that September tends to be a fairly quiet period, as the touring calendar absorbs the âfalloutâ from the summer festival schedule. Iâve had a couple of tentative offers for decent-sized tours, in the early part of next year â however, Iâve got little choice but to hold off for the moment just in case I commit to something three months down the line, only to find out that it clashes, big time, with work that I may be offered in the next few weeks. Itâs a risky approach, I know, but my gut feeling tells me there is a suitable project lurking just somewhere around the corner.\n\nI recall my son telling me (many years back, when one of his foreign school trips happened to geographically coincide with a couple of Deep Purple dates I was doing in Germany) that an optimist lives 15% longer, on average, than a pessimist. I donât think I ever got round to asking him, from where he extricated that pearl of wisdom: however, I suspect, there must be some basis of truth in such a claim. Hey, if itâs any testimony to the above, Iâm still here - albeit having experienced more than a few âdark daysâ over the last couple of years.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Iâve really exhausted most of the funds which were laid aside for investment in the football project and therefore the time has definitely come to duck back into the music business for a while â and make good my (hopefully) temporary loss. Thankfully â and I know Iâve touched upon this before â Iâm well paid for the type of work that I do in the music business, therefore it doesnât (shouldnât!) take long to hoist myself back on to an even keel, financially speaking. I shouldnât really be complaining about having no luck.\n\nOf course, this is my first year with both children at University at the same time so that will be a further drain on family resources. How did my daughter gently put it to me a few months back, when making a case for additional University funding? âListenâ, she intoned, âitâs like this â do you want to be housed in a decent nursing home or a very average one?â Quite, Jade.\n\nAnyway, onwards and upwards as we look to the upcoming week and wonder what (possibly) lies in wait on the touring front. Whatâs happening in the world of football? Well, yesterday for the first time in a long time - I attended a Scottish Premier League game in which I had a player featuring for both sides, namely Hibernian versus Kilmarnock (namely, Thierry Gathuessi and Aime Koudou). Unfortunately for Kilmarnock, Hibernian were convincing winners.\n\nThank you for being (enduring) with me once again, as I strive to document my days and my ways. Iâm sure one day Iâll read back through the archived entries and marvel at my ramblings.\n\nIt was the end of an era, indeed, as of yesterday: my daughterâs now left the house as well - in Jadeâs case, she starts her introductory week at Strathclyde University tomorrow, 24th.\n\nStrange feeling indeed. Her mother, Stella, chose to say âgoodbyeâ here in Edinburgh, unsure as to her (Stellaâs!) emotional state if she had traveled through to the campus in Glasgow, where Jade will be housed for the next year. Anyway, upon arrival, Jade has discovered that there are still one or two items she requires for her room - which means Stella will be making her way over there sometime today. Without traffic, itâs only a 55 minute journey.\n\nAs we were unloading the car yesterday, I happened to remark to Jade (based upon the fact that her room is located on the first floor, accessed from the far end of the downstairs corridor) that âIâm glad I donât have to do this too oftenâ. Jadeâs reply was that I would be back there a year later, assisting her to switch accommodation, probably back off campus.\n\nIt was then that it struck me. Do you ever experience those melancholy moments â particularly during a âtransientâ period of your life, where you wonder just quite where youâll be, exactly a year hence? Iâve often hankered for someone to allow me a momentary glance at (say) three snapshots of me, taken over a three-day period, one year in the future. Would you see yourself in a situation or situations that would prove difficult to fathom?\n\nWell, in this particular instance, I reminded Jade that we must recall our brief, poignant, conversation twelve months down the line and see exactly what the outcome is â and whether we could possibly have imagined myself to be in that situation: will I be in a âbetter placeâ personally? I would certainly hope so. I might even not be here at all in this fragile life!\n\nYes, Iâve had that âone yearâ thought (I know I have) on several previous occasions, but then it always slips my mind as to the actual date and place of the original thought: this time I have a time and a place â and a daughter â to anchor it to. So, we shall see what we shall see.\n\nOn the work front, Iâve made the usual round of calls to my tried and trusted contacts within the concert touring business and therefore â complacent as it might seem â thereâs not really much else I can do. While this touring business of mine is definitely on a âfeast or famineâ basis, something always comes in - itâs just that sometimes it takes a little longer to do so than other times. The answer is to make efficient use of oneâs time during the âwaitâ.\n\nOn the football front, I witnessed a rather entertaining game of football this afternoon when Hibernian managed to scrape a 3-2 result against Celtic here in Edinburgh. The Celtic goalkeeper will want to erase this day from his memory as he made two âhowlersâ which â on both occasions â resulted in a goal for Hibernian. However, even more pleasing for me, was the fact that the other goal was scored by our Cameroonian player, Thierry Gathuessi. Great!\n\nSo, letâs see what the upcoming week will throw at us and which twist of fortune may determine what Iâm up to over the next few months. Yes, itâs risky, but I love it. See yâall.\n\nHow yâall doinâ? Although, Iâm not quite sure how many âyâallâ actually comprises nowadays!\n\nAs I mentioned in last weekâs entry, I spent the first two days of this past week down in London, working on two âshowcaseâ type performances by âJamesâ, at the Hoxton Bar & Grill, near Shoreditch â essentially to preview the new material that they intend to record in the near future. You may recall that the band played a small âwarm-up showâ at the same venue, back in late June of this year, prior to embarking on the outdoor festival tour. The capacity is only two hundred and fifty; therefore it makes for a most intimate experience!\n\nI chose to stay again this time at a very friendly âbed and breakfastâ establishment in Islington (and there are not too many of them in that neck of the woods) called The Kandara, run by Avril and her husband: if youâre ever in need of budget accommodation in that part of London, then I would highly recommend it. Why pay crazy London hotel prices?\n\nBoth shows went down very well and there is little doubt that this band has the ability to compose some very melodic tunes. Two or three numbers from the 13/14 songs on show immediately caught my ear and Iâll be most interested to hear the finished studio versions of those particular songs, when the new album is completed. Of course thereâs always a chance that â with such a variety (and diversity) of songs to choose from - that a few of Monday and Tuesday nightâs set-list may not make the âfinal cutâ. Weâll just have to wait and see.\n\nI traveled back up to Scotland on Wednesday, by train, and in time to witness (on satellite television, anyway) one of the greatest victories ever for the Scotlandâs national team, when we scraped a 1-0 victory against France, a team who made it to last yearâs world cup finals â and we achieved said victory âawayâ in France - and what a goal to win a game with, when James McFadden unleashed a left-footed screamer from all of 35 yards, which flew into the corner of the net. Paris would have been a great place to be on Wednesday night (provided you werenât a French football supporter, of course): and the next ones, right this way please.\n\nI actually found myself headed back down south on Friday afternoon, en-route to London for a Saturday midday meeting - with a couple of well-connected guys - in respect of my football project: Iâve actually been throwing several ideas around with these two particular gentlemen (off and on) for a couple of years now, however they have been heavily involved in their own entertainment-related projects and have only recently found their respective schedules easing up to the point that they are looking for a fresh and challenging venture. Not sure if â and when â we may be able to progress things but I was enthused and encouraged by their collective insight and understanding, relating to my ideas.\n\nSo, here I am back in the house on Sunday evening, preparing to push on with the touring side of my business as of tomorrow morning, and see what awaits me work-wise. I have several people on my list to speak with tomorrow, to follow up various possibilities, and therefore Iâm sure Iâll be âoff and runningâ again before I know it. One never knows just what is just round the corner, in this business. Thanks for being here with me. I know Iâm not alone. BFN.\n\nIâm reminded today of something Joe Cocker once said, on his live âMad Dogs and Englishmanâ album, as he introduced one of the tracks - namely âStrange feeling tonightâ.\n\nFor me, itâs more like âStrange feeling this past weekâ. Of course, I canât quite put my finger on what has heralded this state of mind: initially, I suspect, thereâs some connection to the closing of the âtransfer windowâ (31st August) in the footballing calendar, which effectively means my agency business gently grinds to a halt â in the earnings sense anyway.\n\nHopefully, in the future (when I no longer have to rely on my music business income to shore up my footballing activities) I can utilize the intervening months to continue to develop the football side of the business: there is much one could do in this respect, even just to be in the favourable position to travel around to market oneself.\n\nOne day, one day â¦â¦ (Iâm reminded now of the film âHollandâs Opusâ â check it out).\n\nI most certainly need to find some time to âsit offâ the football project, analyse the direction Iâve been pursuing and look to fine-tune that direction in the future. As I donât look to represent âlocalâ players on an annual basis (I just could not claim to fairly represent such individuals, when Iâm half-way across the world for extended periods of time) I must therefore continue to broker foreign-player deals, in conjunction with my European contacts, mainly in France and Scandinavia. Down through the years, Iâve always strived to conduct my business in a most professional manner and I remain hopeful that some past connection will yield an âundiscoveredâ player of distinction, on which to found the business going forward. I canât keep running around the world for the next ten years: thatâs for sure.\n\nOn the âtouringâ front, Iâm off down to London first thing in the morning to oversee a couple of small âJamesâ showcases where they will preview some of the new material they have been working on, in a live format, at the Hoxton Bar & Grill, in Londonâs east side. It will be good to hook up with the guys once again, while I will take the opportunity â during the day on Tuesday most likely â to meet up with some of my trusted contacts in London. Having narrowly missed out on that massive project which I made mention of last week (and I will âname namesâ at some point in the future, but Iâm afraid itâs still too early to do so, as yet) Iâm now on the lookout for something that will see me through the end of the year.\n\nThere is no doubt that the touring business is something of a âfeast or famineâ existence, however â even at that â it has sustained me through the last thirty plus years, so Iâm sure it will see me right for a few more yet. Am I due a little luck? That may be somewhat presumptuous of me to believe so, as (really) I know Iâve enjoyed a fair amount of luck in my life so far: yes, Iâve worked extremely hard, however if I had stuck to what I know, then I would certainly own, outright, the house in which I now sit. Hell, whatâs gone is gone. You know passion can be both invigorating and destructive: be careful you do not become so engrossed in your passion that you are beyond objective reasoning â and, yes, I know all about that. Onwards, upwards, sideways, down: Iâll find my true direction soon. See ya folks.\n\nToday is the day that I make an actual stab at ascertaining my true financial position.\n\nMy passion and/or love affair with my football project has, to date, a big price tag hanging over it: sure, after almost thirteen years in the business, I have (what I believe to be) an excellent reputation and a myriad of trustworthy and mutually respectful contacts â however, if the truth be known, I also have some hefty credit card balances as well.\n\nThankfully, the lionâs share of my earnings comes from my continued involvement with the music business. So the way it goes is this: run out on the road for a few months and make good money from a touring project â and then come back to Scotland and finance myself for the next six months, in the hope of progressing my football interests. To date, this approach has existed (again if Iâm honest with myself) on a âtwo steps forward, three steps backâ basis. We need to take at least another step forward each time.\n\nThis football agency business continues to be highly competitive and while the ârecentlyâ introduced transfer-window system may (in the eyes of FIFA, anyway) have settled some of the disruption to clubsâ long-term planning, it has only allowed the game to become even more corrupt â certainly in a moral sense, if not in a financial one. Believe me. Believe me.\n\nThis week, I am of a mind to write a piece for the sports section of one of the major UK broadsheets (as I have been approached to do in the past) and just lay bare the whole sorry mess â and a fine mess it is. You think the Stevens report has eradicated â in the main â the thick seam of corruption running through the game? Think again. The perpetrators, admittedly, kept their heads down during the recent flurry of investigative activity but with the heat now off to some degree, they are hesitantly peeking over the parapet again.\n\nYou know what hurts the most? What hurts the most (and this surely emanates from over thirty years of a fairly close involvement with client management in the entertainment business) is that the business world generally sees todayâs modern professional footballer as a seriously easy touch â sometimes nothing less than a cruising commission vehicle.\n\nProfessional football in the UK is riddled with what I term the âcircle the wagonsâ mentality: everyone who makes their living from this industry is in little doubt that all is not well at the heart of our once-beautiful game, but a blind eye is conveniently turned towards proceedings because â letâs face it â you just donât bite the hand that feeds you. I have been a supporter of Heart of Midlothian (âHeartsâ) for as long as I can remember and while Craig Gordon was an excellent goalkeeper and â by all accounts â a decent lad, what madness decrees that one football club pays (allegedly) nine million pounds just to have him play for their team (never mind a weekly salary in excess of Â£30,000 - therefore)? What other business â with budgets to adhere to â would make such an âinvestmentâ?\n\nYou see what happens when you get me started? Still, if nothing else, Iâm back up to speed with my diary entries: let the record show that itâs 12.11 pm on Sunday 2nd. Yes, I feel good!\n\nAugust\n\nI believe I may have touched â in last weekâs diary entry - upon a job opportunity that came my way (music business wise) in the middle of last week. Well, unfortunately I missed it. It was certainly one of the biggest touring projects in the world, between now and the end of this year â and continuing into the beginning of next year.\n\nHowever, being a fairly controversial project (and discretion being everything in my business â as I have made mention of before) I feel it would be inappropriate of me to divulge the details of the offer, just yet. To be honest, considering that for certain periods of the last year I have tended to concentrate solely on the football side of my business, I should probably be flattered that I was even approached in the first place â and then finding myself on short list of only two, to be considered for the position. While the guy who has landed the job ahead of me is a good lad (and highly experienced, into the bargain) Iâm convinced I would have excelled in the position.\n\nSo, letâs have the next job opportunity right this way please! In phoning around most of my trusted music business contacts, Iâm reliably informed that September looks fairly quiet, with things picking up again, from October onwards. This is quite common, on the annual touring calendar, with the summer festival season slowing down markedly and many acts/artistes taking a break, following lengthy touring schedules (the festivals being the icing on the cake, income wise).\n\nWith all my âJamesâ accounting complete and now submitted to the bandâs business management office (as of Friday past), Iâve spent the last two days giving my office a serious tidy. Work will come â it always does (he claims confidently) â and, until such time, the trick is to use oneâs available time effectively: there are always things that can be done.\n\nThis may be the time in my life where I consider attacking the mountain of archived paperwork Iâve accumulated, mainly from a variety of touring projects over the last thirty-plus years.\n\nWhile it is all neatly filed in a plethora of cardboard archive file boxes, there is undoubtedly a substantial portion of it that is now worthless: either as a result of the data being backed up onto my laptop â or purely because much of the information is simply way out of date. Sure, anything of a sentimental nature can be retained, however that can only represent about 20-25% of what lurks against the back wall of the garage. Iâve been contemplating such a clear-out for quite a while now and something in my water tells me the time is right to make a start to the job.\n\nOn the football front, not a whole lot to report. The âtransfer windowâ closes firmly shut next Friday, 31st August, at twelve midnight - although this is mainly in relation to contracted players. For my part, Iâm going to continue to root out âfree agentâ players and then bide my time (a good Scottish phrase that) until the window is closed â in the hope that certain of the clubs have been unable to secure the players they would have ideally liked to sign. Such an approach is not without its risks, however what was it the man once said? âHe who risks nothing, risks everythingâ.\n\nIs another chapter of my helter-skelter life about to unfold? You guys will be the first to know. We have to be careful to believe that we are due an unexpected turn of luck. Until next week â¦\n\nGood evening from the tour bus, en-route back to Manchester after this eveningâs âVâ festival at Chelmsford, having played the âsisterâ festival in Stafford, last night, Saturday.\n\nSadly, that was my last two âJamesâ shows for the foreseeable future: I believe the lads may now be heading into the studio to record some new songs â a couple of which were âroad testedâ on this tour (and to good effect). For my part, there are always the loose ends to tidy up, mainly in respect of the accounting: this should take no more than a few days, the trick being to take a breath and quietly reflect upon the financial comings and goings of the last eight weeks, to ensure that no substantial item of expense has been overlooked.\n\nOne of the drawbacks with festival shows (in comparison to, say, an arena tour) is the lack of consistency, in respect of daily production facilities. On a regular arena tour â or even, if one is able to boast of such a situation, oneâs âownâ stadium tour â you can be sure of having dedicated production facilities at the show each day, complete with your own production flight cases and with phone, fax and internet access. Not so on the festival circuit Iâm afraid where, with anything up to fifty acts on the one festival (typically spread over four or five stages) dressing room allocation is limited. Very often, in fact â particularly if oneâs Artiste is somewhere near the middle to lower half of the bill â only a certain amount of time is available to use the allotted dressing room (Portakabin!) space: said space may then have to be vacated maybe one hour after the Artisteâs set is finished.\n\nPoint being that: if the âdressings roomsâ are sometimes in short supply, then production office facilities can be even scarcer. Nowadays, most bona-fide festival promoters will allocate one Portakabin as a âshared productionâ facility: usually with a couple of phone lines and wireless internet access. However, on any given festival day, there could be as many as ten to twelve Artistesâ Production and Tour Managers making use of such a facility therefore â quite apart from being unable to âhogâ the space for extended periods of time â itâs not all that secure. Keep in mind that this production facility is generally located within the immediate âdressing room villageâ â which can become a substantially busy area as the evening wears on â so itâs really not advisable to leave your laptop sitting there âexposedâ while you run off (say) to procure more red wine for your Artisteâs dressing room.\n\nWhatâs the point of this long-winded explanation, I may hear you enquire? Indeed, just to reinforce my earlier observation that festival shows are not the ideal touring environments to enable one to fully concentrate on such matters as tour accounting â or to accomplish any really meaningful organisational tasks: but, hey, the profit margin generally makes up for that, being that itâs very much a âturn up and playâ situation (i.e. the Artiste does not incur the usual arena touring expense of hauling their own sound and lighting systems from venue to venue).\n\nWell, here we are: time to look around for my next project. I may have some more interesting news about this next week although â the nature of my business being what it is â Iâm not sure how much detail I will be in a position to divulge. For now, Iâm off (to attempt) to balance my books: itâs never a bad thing to know where one stands financially. Does one ever know?! BFN.\n\nGreetings from the south west of Portugal: Zambujeira du Mar, to be precise â which. Today. is the site of the âSudoesteâ festival.\n\nItâs early in the day (just after 1.00 pm) however â mainly because the festival site is over a two hour ride from the Lisbon Sheraton â I decided to travel down here today with the crew, leaving my son back at the hotel, to bring the band down later on, closer to show-time.\n\nIn keeping with most walks of business life, itâs the attention to detail that makes all the difference: in this case, the festival organisers have taken the trouble to allocate me a small production office, which â apart from enabling me to escape the stifling heat â also has internet wireless hooked up! Maybe I can even catch up on my accounting today. Maybe.\n\nAs weâre not scheduled to take the stage until 11.45 pm this evening (and then to play an hour and a half set) the chances are that we wonât make it back to the hotel in Lisbon much before 4.30 a.m. tomorrow morning â and Iâm on an 11.05 flight in the morning. Glamorous lifestyle? Mmmâ¦.\n\nIâm told the band are very popular in this part of the world, even allowing for the fact that â as with many of the âterritoriesâ on this tour, it their first time back in the market for over six years. Part (a major part, surely) on their enduring attraction must be down to the quality of their material down through the years: Iâve only had a quick glance at some of their videos from the last twenty years, however they too seem to be of an excellent creative standard. Jim Glennie â the bandsâ bass player â informs me that there has been at least one book written, charting the history of the band, although up until which point Iâm not sure. Having spent the last couple of months around the lads, I would certainly be interested to delve into the history of the band â so I might just check out the availability of said publication and enlighten myself further.\n\nWell, once tonightâs show is over, weâre down to the last four shows of the âtourâ, all within the UK. Next week we play our only indoor show of the run, at Edinburghâs Corn Exchange â a matter of only four miles from where I live: Iâm actually pondering now if that may be the shortest distance Iâve ever had to travel between my home and any venue I have played, in the last thirty years. This might just be the one. When I lived in California (Woodland Hills to be exact) I know I was involved with a show at âThe Whiskeyâ on Sunset, with the band âAlcatrazzâ, although â thinking back - Iâm sure that was a good fifteen miles from where I was staying at the time.\n\nI suppose I had better push on and find some other work, from the beginning of September onwards, or thereabouts. While we have made some great strides in the last twelve months with our football business, we are certainly not in a position to shelve the music business work. So, onwards and upwards. Something always comes in â mark my words.\n\nSo, with the band not arriving here, on site, for at least another five/six hours, Iâm going to push on with the tour accounting and try to balance my books. One has to be careful not to let the accounts slip too far behind, as itâs very easy to fail to recall every single item of expense, especially when â for whatever reason â there was no receipt available. Iâm counting on me. BFN.\n\nJuly\n\nWell, I can have no complaints regarding lack of time to complete this weekâs entry: Iâm sat here in Riga airport, waiting to board a 10.20 pm flight back to Prestwick Airport in Scotland, following Jamesâs appearance last night, at the Positivus Festival, 90 kilometers north of Riga.\n\nThis was a âfirstâ for the festival organizers, with the Stereophonics being the other band of note on the bill. Personally, I hope the promoter sticks with it as they have obviously put a lot of time and effort (not to mention money) into the production and marketing of their first event.\n\nWe were extremely well looked after and I detected a genuine concern â from all members of the local production staff â to all give it their best shot, in the hope that word will filter back to the industryâs âmover and shakerâ agents that the event is worthy of consideration for some of their other acts, when the festival rolls around again, next year.\n\nMy son (who accompanied me on this trip, as Zebâs availability clashed with dates on the Brian Ferry tour) and I spent most of the day wandering around the city of Riga, mainly working our way through the narrow streets of the âOld Townâ section. This was not my first time in Riga: I was here with âDeep Purpleâ in 2003, off the back of an eight-day Russian tour: however, on that occasion, we were âback-to-backâ with a show the next day in Vilnus in Lithuania which dictated (as is the rule rather than the exception with worldwide touring) that we saw little of Riga on that occasion.\n\nThe flight to Riga was very convenient for my son and myself, leaving Prestwick on late Friday afternoon and returning this evening and myself. Too convenient, I suspect, also for a bunch of Scottish lads to enable them to have spent the weekend here. These lads were in such exuberant mood when they boarded the flight that the announcement by the flight crew (that, due to an âunforeseen technical hitchâ there would be no trolley service on the flight) came as no surprise.\n\nBeing that the city is wide awake, nightlife wise, until the wee small hours of the morning, arriving at 10.15 pm on a Friday evening in no way hinders a bunch of lads intend on ripping it up for hours on end. They would have then had Saturday to recover, more of the same on Saturday night and then a lazy day, today, before boarding tonightâs 10.20 flight back to Prestwick.\n\nOn the football front, I have a couple of young French lads in with the club Partick Thistle at the moment although I suspect that the manager, Ian McCall, may not have the time â particularly as I believe the club will not be running a âreserveâ side this season â that these lads need to acclimatise and to adapt to the style of football here. I should know the outcome tomorrow.\n\nI donât have to leave town again until next Saturday, en-route to Portugalâs âSudoesteâ festival for a show a week today. This leaves me a clear six days to re-assert the whole football project and attempt to construct a template for the future for the most efficient approach for marketing the cream of the foreign players that we are recommended. I have to believe that, provided we do not heedlessly repeat the majority of our mistakes from the past, somewhere down the line we might actually make a living from the football project. Am I dreaming? Mmm...\n\nToday (meant to be Sunday 22nd July, when this edition of the diary should have been penned) I have to come clean: Iâm almost three weeks late in logging this particular entry.\n\nWhere does all the time go? I honestly wish I knew. Typically, I am trying to juggle my touring interests with my football interests: the touring, to pay the bills for the next few years â the football, to hopefully provide some form of âpensionâ, for the years beyond that.\n\nThis week, I may have gone part of the way to ensuring something of the latter, by overseeing the signing of our player, Thierry Gathuessi, to the Scottish Premier League club, Hibernian. As mentioned last week, the deal took a few days to close but â while I have my own views on the way certain aspects of the proceedings unfolded â for the time being, youâll just have to be content to read the facts of the case in my autobiography (not even started yet, but probably heading for two volumes, at this rate).\n\nYou know the main thing, which certain of my âfellowâ agents would do well to heed? The player is blissfully happy â and, for the time being anyway, thatâs all that matters. One is never too old to learn â and Iâve certainly realised a few home truths over the last week. The trick is to put those lessons to good (and, letâs face it, profitable) use when we â hopefully soon â find ourselves in the same, or fairly similar, situation.\n\nOn the touring front, James enjoyed a particularly successful show, on Wednesday past (18th) at the âFly Beeyondâ festival in Athens: there is little doubt in my mind that this band could certainly benefit from further touring work in Greece.\n\nIsnât it strange how certain countries take to certain acts? In the case of James, and these recent festival shows over the last six/seven weeks, they have been particularly well received in the likes of Turkey and Greece (there must be some sort of undercurrent of connectivity with these two countries, keeping in mind their geographical proximity). Busy as we are on these festival shows, I intend to ask Tim Booth or Larry Gott â two of the founder members of the band â just how this may have come about. Did the band enjoy particular âchartâ success in those two, afore-mentioned, countries? Is there something within the lyrical or melodic style of many of the bandâs better-known compositions, that strikes a cultural chord (hard to believe, as their songs are so â refreshingly â varied)? Are the band â and particularly Tim, as the front man, conveying some ethereal message through their music that is compatible with the Greek psyche?\n\nAlternatively, have I any idea what Iâm rambling on about?\n\nThe âFly Beeyondâ festival was staged in the shadow of Athensâs recently constructed Olympic stadium, a building that teetered on the edge of completion, for a good few months. I have to say that â having worked in that part of the world on several occasions, I harboured serious doubts over the nationâs ability to be ready to stage the Olympics in time â but they did it!\n\nNext week itâs Latvia, to where I shall fly directly, from Glasgowâs Prestwick airport. Result! BFN\n\nOla!\n\nToday, I correspond to you from Barcelona: definitely one of my favorite European cities, from where â later this afternoon â I am âforcedâ to return to the UK. I had hoped to spend the intervening days here between yesterdayâs âSummercase 07â festival, alongside Barcelonaâs waterfront, and the next date in Athens (the âFly Beeyondâ festival) on Tuesday, 17th July.\n\nHowever, I have little choice but to go back to the UK, as I need to keep a close eye on one of my French players, Thierry Gathuessi, who is currently being courted by the Scottish Premier Division club, Hibernian. In fact, âpursuedâ might be a better word than âcourtedâ as they appear to be very intent on adding him to the French contingent, already at the club.\n\nAh, the murky waters of football: the majority of the clubs accept that player representatives (âagentsâ as we are more commonly known â although I personally dislike the use of that term) are now part of the fabric of professional football. However, there are still those who see us as the âboilâ on the backside of football. Then there are others that obviously perceive us as a bank, rather than a client-management operation. If some of our clients (many of whom we have nurtured and developed over a considerable period of time) are now in a position to generate some income, within the foreseeable short term, then we should be allowed to share in that.\n\nTherefore, without launching into any blow-by-blow account of the shenanigans of the last few days (Iâll treat you to that in my autobiography), suffice to say that Iâve been left no choice but to âremove my glovesâ in respect of Thierryâs situation. Provided everything is fixed out, over the next few days â as Iâm hoping it will be â then the considerable hassle will have been worth it.\n\nMaybe itâs because Iâm one of the lesser known agents, that there is a tendency to attempt to âpull the wool over my eyesâ: if those that wish to follow that line of reasoning are assuming Iâm something of a lightweight, then let them underestimate me. Bring it on. I do not rely on my football interests to survive - and I will not be compromised in representing the best interests of my clients. Right, thatâs me â Iâve said my bit.\n\nOn the âJamesâ front, we have enjoyed two successful shows in Madrid and Barcelona this week and Iâm just disappointed that I could not have spent the intervening days â prior to next Wednesdayâs show in Athens â here in Barcelona. Nowadays, thankfully, there are âinternetâ airlines that travel between most major cities (Iâve been on quite a few of them on this tour!) so when I find the time to go back to Barcelona for a few days, it should not prove too costly, provided I book ahead of time.\n\nThese past couple of days I have had the luxury of an Assistant Tour Manager, in the form of the charming Ms âZebâ Minto, a Tour Manager in her own right with the likes of the Stereophonics: and what a breath of fresh air it has been. Unfortunately Zeb has other commitments over the next few weeks and cannot be available for all of the remaining dates. So, Iâm back on my âownsomeâ for the Latvia and Portugal shows. Not to worry. See yaâll next week.\n\nDid I ever make mention of the âKinksâ song âWhere have all the good times goneâ?\n\nThereâs a few lines that go something like:\n\nâOnce I had an easy life and always felt the same,\n\nTime was on my side and I had everything to gain,\n\nWondering what I did wrong â¦\n\nWill this depression last too long?â\n\nOver this past week, Iâve had cause â as I occasionally do (and of late, on a more regular basis) â to ponder if my involvement with football will actually, as Iâm often heard to claim, provide me with some sort of âpensionableâ income? Upon my return from Istanbul last week, I arranged to bring a squad of young players over to Scotland, to play in two friendly games, with the aim of placing some of them with Scottish (full time) First and Second Division sides.\n\nWhile the first of the two games (versus Falkirkâs reserve side) ended in a 3-1 victory for my guys, the second of the two games was less encouraging: a 7-1 âdrubbingâ, at the hands of a strong Dundee side â and in less than ideal conditions. However, some would say, such inclement weather conditions are more likely to be the ârule, rather than the exceptionâ â so these âtrialistâ players just have to get on with it and try to show what they can do, in the little time they have. I just wish some of those clubs would give these lads a few weeks to acclimatise, as Iâm convinced there are a few lads there who would settle in to the UK system with relative ease.\n\nOut of a total squad of fourteen players, I firmly believe that at least four of those lads could play regularly at First Division level, were they to be given a little time to integrate themselves.\n\nI continue to believe that this idea of mine â to bring the players to the coaches (because itâs almost impossible to do it the other way round, when the players in question are âunknownsâ) is financially viable in the long term: however, I need to face up to the fact that thereâs a far greater chance of success if I apply the idea to the English market. Thatâs the next plan.\n\nThis weekend past we played the now infamous âT in the Parkâ festival on Saturday and the âOxegenâ festival at Punchestown racecourse, this evening. On Friday night, prior to the T in the Park show, we played a small, âintimateâ set at the delightful âOran Morâ venue in Glasgow: a converted church building on the corner of Glasgowâs Great Western and Byres Roads. While these smaller venues are, respectfully, a severe test of patience for the technical crew, as they attempt to fit all the bandâs equipment onto a frighteningly small stage â but they managed it.\n\nActually, I started this weekâs diary entry on the way back from tonightâs show, as Punchestown is a good hourâs drive from the centre of Dublin. However, I would be misleading you entirely if I were to claim that this was finished on the same night. Anyway, itâs almost finished now: at the end of what has been a strength-sapping weekend. I could see a time where I may become somewhat disenchanted with the whole festival circuit â hopefully thatâs a long way off yet! BFN.\n\nThose of you who are (still) regular readers of this diary â and who log on to the website occasionally to update themselves as to my activities â will note that I have been seriously remiss over the last few weeks, in keeping said entries up to date.\n\nThat, of course, just gives you some idea of how manic things have been, of late. However, the first festival show â played on Friday 29th June â with âJamesâ is now under my belt and I feel a whole lot better for it! The setting for the Istanbul show was indeed marvelous, with the stage being âperchedâ on an elevated position, overlooking the beach front area.\n\nWhen the technical crew and myself arrived in Istanbul on the Thursday night, we decided it would be best to drop our bags and head out to the site that evening, if only to check that our air-freighted gear had arrived safe and sound (no pun intended). As a result of a two-hour delay out of Manchester airport, en-route to Istanbul, we did not reach the Istanbul hotel until after eight in the evening, after which we had to endure a seventy-five minute drive to reach the beach site (so, we were thinking, if it takes that amount of time to travel from the hotel to the site at nine âo clock in the evening â whatâs it going to be like during the day?!).\n\nIn these outdoor festival situations, it follows that the higher up you are on the âbillâ, the more control you have over the various parameters of your performance. In the case of Istanbul, James were topping the bill, therefore we were allowed as much time as was reasonably required to check and set our equipment in readiness for the bandâs sound-check the next day.\n\nWith the journey back to the hotel taking just as long â and with us having to leave the hotel the next morning at 8.00 am, to enable the band to have a sound-check at 10.00 am the next morning â we missed out on a decent nightâs sleep once again. This, invariably, is the life I lead.\n\nHaving arrived the night before, we were aware of a certain amount of general entertainment activity on the expanse of beach front below us: of course, in the warm light of day, all was revealed in itâs Technicolor splendour. Apart from the usual beach-side activities (pedal boats, water skiing, snorkeling etc,) there was also a wide variety of showground-type attractions spread out along the âpromenadeâ area of the beach front, for the festival goers to partake of, before â and after â the musical entertainment available on the main stage.\n\nThe heat, of course â come the middle of the day â was stifling and, with the advent of experience on their side, the Turkish promoters had installed some fairly heavy-duty air conditioning units in the temporary tent-like dressing room structures: so I spent a good amount of time, once sound-check was complete, working away in our âcoolâ dressing room.\n\nNot much sleep on Saturday night either, as the only flight we had been able to book â at the relatively short notice I had when setting up the Istanbul show â was an 8.45 am departure! Air travel nowadays is, unavoidably, a tedious rigmarole and to the man who can come up with a hassle-free alternative to be able to travel from A to B in the shortest of times â as an alternative to flying â great riches are on offer. Tonight, I will definitely sleep. Until next week...\n\nJune\n\nOK, in most cases honesty IS the best policy.\n\nTherefore I have to admit that, as I sit here in my Islington Guest House, itâs technically Monday morning, the 25th: however, when I reflect upon how late Iâve penned previous additions of the diary, then this could be considered as something of a âresultâ.\n\nJust before I delve into the goings-on of the last week, Iâm proud to announce that my son, at reasonable expense to his belaboured father, has received the news, a few days ago, of his successful graduation: I somehow perceive that he is the first Duncan to achieve such a feat.\n\nYou know, to give you some idea of how time consuming this James project has been (is), I havenât gone to bed at the same time as Beverley, in the last ten days: although, thinking about it, I did almost manage to clamber into bed before her once â last Sunday in fact â as it took her over three hours to return from the George Michael concert in Glasgow: sheâs got it bad.\n\nWeâve been in rehearsals, with âJamesâ for two days now, and â hectic as its been (as rehearsals always are) I now have a fair grasp of whatâs involved to make these upcoming festival shows happen. As I may have mentioned last week, this is about the first time in six or seven years that the band have undertaken festival shows: they all appear very enthused by the prospect.\n\nBradley and I traveled down to London, Friday night, on the sleeper train. Although I had looked forward for years to the prospect of making such a journey with him, can you believe that itâs only now, when heâs twenty-one, that weâve actually got around to it! Time marches on.\n\nIâve always had a fondness for the sleeper: maybe itâs just the old truck driver in me that prefers the still of the night, rather than the bustle of the day (although, having said that, I seem to have ended up living my life in the âbustle of the dayâ). Once the train is on the move, Iâll generally wander down to the âdiningâ car with my newspaper, order a beer and their haggis and potatoes dish, and observe the lights of the night slipping by. Look at it this way: if you canât finish your work â as I didnât on Friday evening â until just after ten, then how else are you going to be in the centre of London for 0800 in the morning, without losing a good few hours sleep? You have to sleep â so why not sleep while youâre traveling (the same way as a tour bus).\n\nUpon arrival in London, we dropped our bags over at the Islington Guest House, took the landladyâs kind offer of breakfast and then headed over to the rehearsal studio, via the bandâs city hotel, where I needed to check that the front desk was prepared for their arrival later on.\n\nSince that point, itâs just been a 48-hour flurry of activity but weâve certainly accomplished a whole heap of work: Bradley boy has definitley earned his corn: weâre on the first floor of the studios and heâs probably been up and down those stairs about fifty times so far. Tomorrow night we play a small âwarm-upâ show at the Hoxton Bar & Grill in east London, so that will be my first chance to check out the band in a live format. The studios close at 11.00 pm tonight, so it would appear that I will have little choice but to enjoy a good nightâs sleep! See yâall next week.\n\nBoy, did I get a little behind with my diary entry this past week: it might say the 10th, above, however itâs rather more into the next week as I sit here and pen this entry.\n\nHowever, with good cause!\n\nI have now taken on the Tour Management of the band âJamesâ, who â on the back of a very successful, recent, UK tour are now on the brink of venturing out over the summer, both in the UK and Continental Europe, to undertake a string of outdoor festivals.\n\nI met with the management company on Friday past, at their London headquarters, where they outlined the touring period on offer, as well as giving some insight into the history of the band â and most colourful it is. While I think the band will most fondly be remembered for their classic, almost-anthemic, âSit Downâ there are other tracks you would hear (as I have in the past few days), such as âSheâs a Starâ and âLaidâ, and think, yes â I know those songs.\n\nIâve loaded the âFresh as a Daisyâ CD into my carâs player, to find that â apart from the tracks mentioned above â there are several other pleasantly listenable songs: similarly some very imaginative videos have been produced to market many of those tracks. I honestly donât know when the first single on the album âRing the Bellsâ was released however consider the longevity that the band can boast, it was probably released a while ago â yet seems energetically fresh.\n\nAnyway â with respect to the lads in the band â Iâll just have to keep the music in the background, reason being Iâve got a tour to organize: first date, Istanbul on 30th of this month. Although I can see a few late nights coming up, itâs great to be back in the swing of things and I look forward to meeting the guys in pre-tour rehearsals. On the live performance front, the band are represented by the X-Ray touring agency, with whom I go as far back as 1980 when â in one of their former guises â I was associated with them when I worked with Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nOn the way back on the train from London on Friday evening my âhead was buzzingâ (as they would say in Scotland) with the all the information Iâd crammed into it, following the meeting with the bandâs management company and also their business managers (also located in London), therefore I took the opportunity to pop in and say hello: as with myself, to some degree, both companies work away, tirelessly, in the background to ensure the smooth running of the tour.\n\nSaturday and Sunday, I just chained myself to my laptop in the office, in order to formulate a framework for the many organizational facets of my Tour Management brief. As the tour consists almost exclusively of âmultiple billâ shows, we are saved the expense of trucking sound and lighting systems around with us: therefore a tour such as this does not merit a full-blown Production Manager. Nevertheless it requires me to oversee several production-orientated issues such as air-freight, musical equipment rental and technical document preparation.\n\nA busy upcoming week awaits me, but Iâm up to the challenge and although Iâve jumped onto a moving vehicle here, it wonât be long before Iâm up to speed. See you back here next week. BFN.\n\nEvening, all. And a fine Sunday evening it is, too (if youâll pardon the grammar).\n\nThe news this week is that I may be in the running for some touring work for the months of July and August â a string of festival dates with a very notable band (whoâs career was launched in the mid-eighties) and who are currently enjoying a refreshing resurgence of interest.\n\nAs Iâve mentioned before in the diary, I canât really ânames namesâ until Iâve confirmed my involvement with any given tour: tomorrow (Monday 4th), Iâll be following up last Fridayâs initial contact, from the management, to see how realistic my involvement might be. Cool, huh?\n\nOne heartening aspect of the touring period in question is that â for the time being at least â there is a six-day gap in the schedule that may allow me to stage the âtrialistâ football game that I was planning. However, itâs important that I pop down to London on Tuesday or Wednesday to clarify the situation. So, within a few days, I should know whatâs what.\n\nIâve spent a good few hours on the phone this week, to my football contacts in both Belgium and France (thank God for discount international calling cards!) just to ascertain how easy it will be to assemble another squad of âtrialistâ players to make the journey to Scotland.\n\nAs the majority of the professional clubsâ personnel (both players and coaches alike) are on vacation over the next 2 â 3 weeks, it will be difficult to get any commitment on prospective dates for the games that I have in mind.\n\nMeanwhile, I continue to believe that there are some great young â and relatively undiscovered â French players: they just need the opportunity to showcase their raw talent. With these lads, the plan is to place them with Scottish First and Second Division (full-time) clubs, for at least the upcoming season. These will be young, hungry, players who are desperate to show that they have the makings to force their way â albeit at an early stage â into the UK football market. To that end, I have great trust in my French contact, to unearth the required type of talent.\n\nThe game â provisionally planned for the third week in July â will be much along the lines of the recent game, on the 18th May, versus the Hibernian reserve side: that is, young professionals who have been âschooledâ at a decent level, on the continent, and who may â for whatever reasons â have âslipped through the netâ. Theyâre definitely out there. Iâm convinced of it.\n\nSo, the plan for the next week is this: meet up with the people concerned and hopefully have a decision on the touring project. As the first date, on the tour in question, is not until 30th June, that does leave me enough time to organise and prepare for the tour â and make the basic arrangements for the âtrialistâ game, provided of course that I can find the clubs who will offer the opposition (and confirm the dates) that will fit into my available âwindowâ. 24/7 here.\n\nIâm buoyed by the fact that we pulled the last game together at ten days notice therefore, provided the clubs can commit to the available dates, thereâs no reason we canât do it again!\n\nMay\n\nSomething of a reflective week, I would have to say.\n\nHaving arranged the trial game for my European trialist footballers â as detailed last week â Iâm now wondering if I should â could â do it again.\n\nAlready â based upon a squad of decent players who were hurriedly assembled in under a week â there has been noted interest from several Scottish professional clubs, to a lesser or greater degree, in the majority of the players. So, now Iâm thinking, given a little more time â what might I be able to accomplish? If, for example, I was given four weeks â rather than just one â could I unearth a squad of foreign players that (provided they are given a fair chance to show what they can do, to a wider footballing audience) could make it at a decent level in the UK?\n\nConsequently, this last week, I have met up with several trusted confidantes, who operate â in varying respected roles â within the football arena.\n\nObviously, while I have an excellent contact network here in Scotland, the ultimate aim is to give the players the opportunity to ply their trade âsouth of the borderâ, in England.\n\nThe dilemma here is palpable: thereâs enough time available to arrange a second (possibly even a third!) game, however Iâd have to dedicate the next six weeks to the related logistics. Could I arrange said games, if I was out on the road at the same time? One argument definitely says that, while Iâm awaiting the offer of appropriate touring work, I might as well make some initial enquiries as to which other (English?) clubs may be interested to provide the opposition for a similar type of game, as part of their pre-season build up â prior to the start of the new season.\n\nOf course, the weight of trusted opinion that I have received this past week leans towards advising (once again) that I stick to what I do best. So, I need to take some time on this one.\n\nI often (even more so lately) reflect that, based on the time and money Iâve invested on my football project that â surely â Iâm due a little slice of luck. I do believe that my steep learning curve is finally starting to straighten itself out at last: therefore I may just have to hang in a little longer until things start to come good for me. Is that how every entrepreneur sees it?\n\nThere are days when I believe Iâm so close to achieving my vision and, equally of course, there are other days when I sense I may be at the North Pole of hope, with a telescope trained on the South Pole of improbability (I just read that out to my son â who is home from University for the summer â and he appears fairly impressed!). Confidence, as always, is everything.\n\nOf course, Iâll let you know next week how things turned out: as I said before, I may as well make good use of my time and at least formulate the framework of an idea, the cost to do so being negligible, for the time being. Maybe, in the upcoming week, I will have some more positive contact from some of the clubs who attended last weekâs game. That would at least help to sway me in one direction, or the other, as to whether to push on with the project. Wish me well. BFN.\n\nYou may not believe this (because Iâm still having to pinch myself) but Iâve done it!\n\nIn the space of a week, Iâve somehow managed to confirm to Hibernian at 9.00 am last Monday that I could go ahead with the game â and by Friday at 1.00 pm said game was kicking off!\n\nMost of the players arrived during the day on Wednesday, therefore we took the advantage of a light training session that evening. We then did a more comprehensive workout the next day (including a 20-minute âbounceâ game against some of the younger Hibernian players, who were training at the same facility as us on Thursday: then the game on Friday.\n\nSpecial mention must go to John Robertson, the former Hearts striker, who was good enough to offer his services to coach the players over the three days that they were here. Now, John claimed to have seen himself in purely an organisational role rather than that of coaching, However, having spoken to several of the players on Friday night at dinner, after the game, there was no doubt in their minds as regards his coaching skills.\n\nThink about this now: we have a squad of twelve players (nationalities: 1 Brazilian; 1 Portuguese; 1 Benin; 5 French; 1 Cameroon; 1 Nigerian; 2 Gambians) arriving from all parts of Europe â mostly who have never met each other before â and within less than 72 hours John has them shaped into a âformidable fighting unitâ. Oh, to have that ability. It was a joy to behold.\n\nFor my part, Iâm sure the only reason that I pulled it off in such a short time, was as a result of my extensive touring experience when we invariably have to accomplish great amounts of work in considerably short spaces of time. Thereâs really no question of âcan it be done?â - it just has to be done. Yes, Iâve had some fairly late nights this week: but Iâve had the pleasure of working with a great bunch of lads.\n\nThe game finished 1 â 1 and the only slightly disappointing element to the day was that we only had a 70% turnout of the club representatives who had indicated they would make it along to the game. Unbeknown to myself, there was a football presentation dinner being held in Glasgow, where the famed Marcel Lippi was one of the speakers â and so several of Scotlandâs more renowned managers and coaches took the opportunity to attend that function.\n\nNot that I could have done much about it, even if I had known. I was fortunate to have Hibernian agree to play the game at such relatively short notice so I was in no position to attempt to shift the game around. For the next time (oh, yes, Iâm formulating the plan already) we should definitely look to stage the game in the evening: this way more coaches â who are not out on t"
