Whisk for 6-8 minutes on a medium to high speed until it starts to whiten and firm into stiff peaks, slowing the speed and add the sugar slowly in stages, increasing the speed in between adding the sugar, when all the sugar is added whisk on medium speed for 3 minutes.\n\nThe meringue is ready when a peak stays standing firm on the whisk attachments once you remove it. You’re looking for stiff peaks.\n\nLine 2 baking trays with parchment, using a large plate draw out a circle on each of the sheets of baking parchment. Fill both circles with you meringue mix, spreading it with a spatula till it fills the circle, leaving a couple of inches around the whole tray. Place in oven to bake for 1.5 hours.\n\nWhile the pavlova is baking, with a spoon remove the cream/fat at the top of the tin of coconut milk and transfer to a bowl. Add the coconut yogurt, maple syrup and the vanilla extract. Mix it all together for a minute or two until it becomes uniform and homogeneous in terms of texture and look.\n\nWhen the pavlovas are baked, turn off the oven and allow the pavlovas to cool and dry out further in the oven. We usually make them single layer pavlovas but if you are confident enough to make a double layer go for it, just ensure that your pavlovas are light and strong. When they have cooled, spread the coconut cream/yogurt over the pavlova and scatter with berries.\n\nAdd a couple of fresh mint leaves too, serve and enjoy.\n\nCook Time: 15 Minutes\n\nServes: 2\n\nIngredients\n\n2 eggs\n\n2 Tablespoons sugar\n\n3 teaspoons vanilla\n\n170g Mascarpone cheese\n\n1 Tablespoon milk\n\n175ml strong espresso\n\n4 Tablespoons Marsala wine\n\n1 Tablespoon cocoa powder\n\n2 Savoiardi Biscuits\n\nInstructions\n\nSeparate the eggs; place egg whites in one bowl and egg yolks in another bowl.\n\nBeat together yolks, vanilla, sugar, milk and Mascarpone cheese.\n\nBeat egg whites until stiff.\n\nGently fold the stiff egg whites into the cheese mixture.\n\nMix together the espresso and Marsala wine.\n\nDip the Savoiardi Biscuits into the espresso / Marsala wine mixture.\n\nLine 2 small bowls with the Savoiardi biscuits.\n\nTop each bowl with the Mascarponi mixture, dust each with cocoa powder, serve and enjoy!"
