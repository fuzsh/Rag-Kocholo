        "text": "Once the Absolute and 3 GHR AM transmitters are closed, looking at the OFCOM TxParams list, I make that 171 UK AM transmitters still on the air (or 170 if we ignore Premier Radio's Bow Tx which hasn't emitted anything since 2019).\n\nThat is split as follows:-\n\n24 x BBC 5 Live\n\n22 x Talk Sport\n\n17 x Smooth Radio\n\n15 x BFBS Gurkha Radio\n\n9 x BBC Radio 4\n\n8 x BBC Locals - Cumbria, Guernsey, Derby, Gloucester, Jersey, Norfolk & Somerset.\n\n7 x Bauer locals, mainly in Scotland\n\n6 x Gold\n\n5 x Greatest Hits Radio\n\n5 x Premier Christian Radio\n\n4 x BBC Asian Network\n\n3 x BBC Nations, Scotland , Wales.\n\nFinally LBC, Radio Caroline, Sunshine, various Asian, Hospital, Community, University and Military stations.\n\nOf those which are likely to not make the end of 2023 do you think?\n\nBaur's plans for the AM/MW services in Scotland, i.e. Clyde 2, Forth 2, Westsound etc., to rebrand as \"Greatest Hits\" and drop the heritage local names, would suggest shutdown of all AM transmitters by Monday 3 April 2023.\n\nThe Bauer press office release says that the Clyde 2 Breakfast Show with Ewan & Cat will continue on the \"Greatest Hits Radio\" in Scotland, with a the full programme schedule release later. If Bauer are not going to continue with the current Scottish daytime presenters and instead take GHR from 10am, then that will require surrender of all the AM \"2\" licences to enable GHR to be fully networked in Scotland on DAB.\n\nThis could be the reason for the early New Year announcement of the end of the heritage names in Scotland. Step 2 will be an announcement after RAJAR Q4/2022 results are published on 2nd February 2023, that the AM transmitters will be closed down in April 2023 to accommodate the new network service to Scotland.\n\nAfter 49 years on-air, Clyde on 261m/1152 kHz AM will go off-air as will all the others.\n\nThe fact that AM is mentioned in the press release about Clyde and all the other stations becoming GHR suggests that the switch off is not immenent.\n\n1161 and 1584 hasn't been mentioned for years on Tay 2 up in my neck of the woods and I assume likewise that 1152 isn't mentioned in any of the sweepers on Clyde 2?\n\nOver the past 15 years or so, Bauer have made all the changes gradually and I think the dropping of the local brands in favour of the one GHR brand will be enough for the first quarter of the year.\n\nI doubt they will be under any political pressure to retain the MW transmitters but maybe after six months they'll be able point to a country wide Rajar showing that almost no one is listening on MW (they've already got a head start in Aberdeen lol) and announce that the six remaining transmitters will close.\n\nBeing all sentimental about it, closing these transmitters on the 31st December, 50 years to the day that Radio Clyde 261 launched would be a fitting end. Unlikely to happen as accountants and business executives aren't generally radio geeks or sentimental about outdated and expensive radio transmission systems.\n\n0\n\nI'm sure it was suggested that Radio Norfolk could get coverage of some of west Norfolk that way, but the SSDAB service has finally launched and it hasn't happened. I'm also pretty sure there was talk of the Norfolk mux being expanded to cover the west of the county but nothing more seems to have been done there either even though there are several suitable sites in the area already carrying the BBC mux. Of-course Radio Norfolk is available on FM in west Norfolk and newer BBC locals, including the neighbouring BBC Suffolk, never had medium wave in the first place - it was FM or nothing.\n\nHere is a coverage map from (I think) the early 1990s, note that obviously Postwick has gone and that the Tacolneston FM site has moved to Stoke Holy Cross.\n\nWhich bits are not serviced by FM that are by West Lynn?\n\nhttps://up.metropol247.co.uk/commseng/BBC%20Radio%20Norfolk%20coverage%20map%201990s%20.jpg\n\nAlthough I live in Norfolk I am in the eastern bit and don't often go over to the other side (it's a big county!) so I don't really have any personal knowledge to share on that, but I can't see why Great Massingham wouldn't serve the area adequately. I know West Lynn's medium wave signal gets up to the north-west coast pretty well, but 104.4 comes in well enough there too despite what that map would have you believe. There's a further FM relay now at West Runton (95.6) which was added to improve reception along the north coast.\n\n0\n\nI spent far more effort than it was worth getting Absolute on 9°E.\n\nI can say that the feed is pre-processed somewhat, it's mono, the frequency response is cut off sharply just below 7kHz, and the AM switch off messages are of course there.\n\nInteresting, suggests the bulk of the processing is done pre feed, not at the tx, which is as I would expect\n\nThat was certainly the way it had been done when the BBC used the frequency, I suppose why pay for many processors when one (and a spare) at the point of distribution can be used.\n\nIt would also explain why the Boston tx suddenly managed to radiate a wider bandwidth although I would expect there to be some form of bandwidth limitting at the transmitter site and maybe a level limitter too should there be a fault on this main feed.\n\n1\n\nIt's very hard to predict. Two possble scenarios are\n\n1) No further closures this year.\n\n2) All remaining Bauer and Global transmitters close; the BBC close all AM transmitters except for the 12 most important 5 Live transmitters and the three LW transmitters; Talk Sport close half their transmitters; Premier give up on AM and most of the LPAMs either close or move to FM.\n\nThen we have everything inbetween.\n\nWe'd all be amazed if your first option is the one that happens.\n\nI was amazed that there was only one closure (Swansea) from the big four broadcasters last year. Therefore, I thought it wise to keep the no further closures option on the table, but I don't think it's very likely either.\n\nWe had this post a couple of weeks before Christmas and Commseng vouched for the poster's reliability\n\nI think you will find the new year will bring two announcements about BBC,AM. One in each direction\n\n…. But perhaps not what some would expect ….So not is all lost !.\n\nOne half of this has now been confirmed. We know that long wave has been extended for another year (at least). Thus, I think we can expect a further announcement about AM from the BBC in the near future.\n\nGlobal are hard to predict. They may shut down all of their AM transmitters at midnight toninght without warning (they've done this before with individual lincences) or keep them all going for another few years. Smooth South Wales and Smooth Herts, Beds and Bucks both saw increases in their RAJAR ratings after they lost AM at the end of 2020, so I suspect that the business case for keeping Smooth on AM is pretty weak.\n\nBauer will likely continue to close down local AM transmitters in batches of 4 (or so); the next batch may close later this year or in 2024. Clyde 2/ GHR Glasgow will probably be the last one to go unless Bauer buy the 96.3FM licence from Nation as its audience is much much bigger than any of the others .\n\nTalksport - it's very difficult to predict or not they will close transmittters this year. Power reductions are likely to be their main priority.\n\n0"
