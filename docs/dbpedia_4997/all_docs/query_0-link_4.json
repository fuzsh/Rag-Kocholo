        "text": "The Complete Biography\n\n1982\n\nRicky Ross, a former youth club leader and teacher joins Woza, a local band in Glasgow providing keyboards and vocals, while continuing to work part time as a teacher for children with behavioural difficulties in the Maryhill district. The band remain together for a year supporting bands like \"Friends Again\" and the \"Waterboys\" throughout the region.\n\n1983\n\nNow solo Ricky concentrates on his writing and records his efforts under the title \"So Long Ago\". The album was to feature eventual Deacon Blue bass player Ewen Vernal and also Ricky's first and then wife Zara.\n\nThe album was recorded on a small local independent label \"Sticky Music\" and around 800 cassettes were produced. Ricky sent a copy of \"So Long Ago\" to London based publishers, only to be told he should form a band. Forming a band was not central to Ricky's idea's at this stage, he firstly wanted to be a house songwriter allowing other artists to records his songs. But he later agreed that he should showcase his own material.\n\n1985\n\nForming a band suddenly became a focal point for Ricky and 1985 saw the first incarnation of Deacon Blue who took their name from a song on the Steely Dan album \"Aja\". There were several line up changes during this period but a stable five piece unit was eventually formed with Douglas Vipond on drums, James Prime on keyboards, Graeme Kelling on guitar and Ewen Vernal returning to Ricky''s side on bass. They experimented with backing vocals during their live sets and soon felt that a female vocal added a new perspective to the overall sound of the band. Carol Moore was replaced by Lorraine McIntosh who's amazing vocal talents and frenetic stage presence lit up their entire set.\n\n1986\n\nDeacon Blue embark on a whole succession of local gigs, honing their material and stage presentation. After rejection from every other record label they finally had interest from Gordon Charlton of CBS records. He was in Glasgow to see another band, and during his time there he heard a demo tape which the band had made. He was immediately impressed, particularly by the song \"Dignity\". Charlton persuades Muff Winwood CBS head of A&R to see the band at a showcase in Glasgow.\n\nAugust The band sign to CBS and, by the autumn are supporting \"Sandie Shaw\" and \" Lone Justice\" on a series of University gigs in the north of England and Scotland.\n\nDecember The band started recording their debut LP at AIR studios in London.
