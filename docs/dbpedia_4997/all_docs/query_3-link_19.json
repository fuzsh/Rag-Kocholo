        "text": "The world’s first TV stations appeared in the United States in the late 1920s and early 1930s. While TV shows were novel at the time, as we all know, they’ve become an almost universal part of life. TV is so integral to the world’s culture that many shows embody the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nOf course, all of the first TV shows are gone, but all of the shows on this list have been around for decades. In fact, many of these shows first aired in the 1950s, when TV started becoming an everyday pastime. And while it might be hard to believe, most of these shows are still going strong.\n\n8. The Young and the Restless\n\nphoto source: Wikipedia\n\nSince its debut in 1973, The Young and the Restless has won 9 Emmy Awards and has also been the highest-rated daytime drama on American television. Additionally, this iconic soap opera has been right at the top of the Nielsen ratings for more than 1,000 weeks since 1988.\n\nThe Young and the Restless focuses on two families and in particular the rivalry between Jess Walton’s “Jill Abbott” and Jeanne Cooper’s “Katherine Chancellor”, the longest rivalry on any American soap opera.\n\nThis widely popular show is also the first television show to receive its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe show aired its 12,000th episode in 2020 and CBS has renewed The Young and the Restless through the 2023–24 television season.\n\n7. The Price Is Right\n\nphoto source: Flickr via Digital Photos\n\nThough this show is relatively young compared to the other stalwarts on this list, The Price is Right is the longest-running game show in television history. This popular game show series has aired over 9,000 episodes over a span of 50 years!\n\nThe Price is Right is competition that lets the studio audience participate as contestants to win cash and prizes. It was originally hosted by Bob Barker until Drew Carey took over in 2007 — Barker hosted the show for 35 years!\n\nThis show is a staple of daytime television and it’s so popular that TV Guide even named it as one of the “greatest game show of all time.”\n\n6. Sesame Street\n\nphoto source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn its 53rd season, Sesame Street is one of the most iconic children’s educational programs in television history.

Due to this, Sesame Street is considered one of the best educational television shows for children across the world.\n\nAs of 1996, 95% of all preschoolers in America had watched the show before they turned 3, and as of 2014. The show has won 210 Daytime Emmy Awards, 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, and 8 Grammy Awards, surpassing the trophy tally of all other children’s shows.\n\n5. Scooby-Doo\n\nphoto source: Wikipedia\n\nThe fun of childhood was elevated to a whole new level with “those meddling kids” and their “meddling dog” and if Scooby-Doo wasn’t a part of your childhood, we seriously have no words for you!\n\nThis animated cartoon franchise, originally created by Hanna-Barbera Productions, gained a mass following the likes of which were unprecedented for a cartoon show. The enduring popularity of Scooby-Doo has lead lead to various movies and spin-offs, and is the reason why the show is still broadcast today, despite having gone through several networks over the years.\n\nThe current Scooby-Doo series is airing on the streaming service HBO Max.\n\n4. Days of Our Lives\n\nphoto source: Wikipedia\n\nDays of Our Lives is one of the longest running soap operas in television history, first going on air on November 8, 1965. The show hasn’t looked back since and is still going strong, with hour-long broadcasts every weekday around the world!\n\nDue to its coverage of topics that other soaps shied away from in the 70s, Days of Our Lives was considered a daring drama, making it the most widely distributed soap opera in the United States and leading to numerous references on other shows, parodies, and crossover appearances.\n\nIn fact, the show was (and still is!) so popular that apart from the good common folk of the United States, it has several A-list fans such as Julia Roberts and Thurgood Marshall!\n\nWhile there have been talks of ending one of the oldest TV series in recent years, NBC decided to renew “Days of Our Lives” through September 2023.\n\n3. Guiding Light\n\nphoto source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe mother of all soap operas, Guiding Light set the precedent for soap operas around the world. This American television soap even holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running television drama in the country’s history.\n\nInitially a radio broadcast from 1937-1956, the show switched to its televised format in 1957 and has an astounding runtime of 72 years with both formats combined.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, CBS announced that Guiding Light was canceled due to low ratings, after broadcasting more than 15,000 episodes.
