        "text": "There’s a real sense of exuberance in the largely Glaswegian, and ever-present crowd at The Sub. Every week, every warm-up, and every close, along with Harrigan, Cappello’s detailed understanding of the dancefloor, his unfathomable technical ability, and his sixth sense to build a groove are constant and undeniable.\n\nWith over twenty releases in his wake dropping on labels like 20:20 Vision, Nautilus Rising, Soma and his own Seventh Sign, Cappello, – who could easily of had an equally accomplished career in standup comedy – is about to drop an atomic bomb with his latest album, ‘Basement Philosophy.’\n\nThis man is not a seeker of the limelight. ‘Fuck Tik Tok & Fuck Instagram.’ Domenic Cappello really is all about the music.\n\nWhere are you from in Glasgow?\n\nI was born and brought up in Hutton Drive in Linthouse (Govan) in Glasgow. I used the street name for my first forays into producing. I now live Southside of the city.\n\nGlasgow’s has reinvented itself as a post-industrial hub of art & culture. Were there tough times growing up or are all your memories sweet?\n\nGlasgow was like most big cities growing up. There are places where you need to be very careful walking through, and there’s places where you could ride a unicycle wearing a fur coat, shin guards, and tiara and no one would look at you twice. It’s a city with a rough and smooth side, like most big cities.\n\nIt didn’t feel like a tough place to live growing up because when it’s all you know, you just get on with things. Looking back, there’s been some sticky moments when things could have gone badly, very quickly, and they have done for friends in the past, but I love the place warts and all and the only thing I’d change about it is the weather.\n\nWhat made you want to play music to people for a living?\n\nProbably just wanting to hear my own music that I had bought, loud on a club sound system.\n\nBefore The Sub I DJ’d in a bar playing blues. Then Acid House came along, and then Sonny Boy Williamson took a back seat for Phuture.\n\nI also DJ’d at an illegal after party called Desert Storm.\n\nSubculture is the longest running weekly house and techno night on the planet. Why has it gone on so long?\n\nIt’s all down to the people who own the club, and all the people who have worked hard behind the scenes for the past 30 years. We play only a small part in the success.\n\nIt would have been easy for the owners to put on big cheesy guests every Saturday, followed ever moving trends and filled the place, but they’ve never wanted that, they wanted something more, and probably sacrificed financially to give us that. That has given us the platform to play.\n\nThe best clubs and parties are resident focused. What are your thoughts on this in relation to Subculture?\n\nIt’s everything in relation to Subculture. Yes, there are guests, and yes, we try and bring in young local talent to play, but at the end of the day the residents are there pretty much every week.\n\nThe club site’s been many things over the years; a speakeasy where Louis Armstrong played, a steakhouse in the 70s and a ‘porn’ cinema.\n\nAll right apart from the cinema. That was next door!\n\nDidn’t Primal Scream play their first gig there in ’88?\n\nYeah, I think they did, I wasn’t there though, I was never an Indie kid so I wouldn’t have gone anyway.\n\nIn 2006 the club had a Bodysonic dancefloor installed. What is that and does it involve Lycra?\n\nBass bins are sunk in the floor under the dancefloor, and yes, Lycra is involved in everything I do.\n\nIs there anyone you haven’t been able to get as a guest?\n\nWould always have loved to have Laurent Garnier in for a Saturday but another Glasgow promoter used to book him and wouldn’t allow it. Club politics, eh?\n\nWould also have loved to have UR live in the club, the full collective. I think that would be unreal.\n\nHoney Dijon reckons the club is full of loads of “sexy drunk Scottish” people. Do you attest to that?\n\nI’d never dream of disagreeing with Honey.\n\nSubculture is older than some of the punters on your dancefloor. How do you maintain that connection with new generations?\n\nIt’s the music. That’s the key.\n\nIf most of the music you play each weekend is new, that’s a lotta digging. How do you keep up that volume?\n\nI listen to new music every single day. I’ll put stuff by every day, then come Friday, I’ll go through it all again, get rid of some of the stuff I’m maybe not feeling after another fresh listen, and then spend Saturday all day prepping for that night.\n\nWhat day of the week does it take you to recover after a Saturday sesh?\n\nI’m usually fine by Tuesday in July at some point.\n\nBasement Philosophy sets out a powerful intention. Has it been long in the making?\n\nIt’s been off and on since just after lockdown. I tried making stuff during lockdown, when I had loads of time, but I was so down, I just couldn’t get into it.\n\nOnce the clubs reopened, I got a rush of excitement and creativity and it all started from there. Some tracks happened really quickly, and some took a bit longer but that’s just normal.\n\nWhat is the ‘philosophy of the basement’ while we’re at it?\n\nEverything that isn’t Tik Tok techno. Deep, dark, smoke-filled intimacy.\n\nWhen you started making the album, did you have an intention in mind?\n\nI wanted something that would work in the club but also something that you could listen to at home on headphones and hear all the layers.\n\nSometimes these subtleties can get lost on a club system, or if there’s too much in the track, and it sounds good on headphones, it can sound too busy in a club.\n\nI’ve been guilty in the past of adding too much to tracks, having it sound amazing in the studio but it’s too much in a club. I wanted to get the balance right between both. I think I achieved that.\n\nI also wanted every track to be a club track for DJs. No ambient fillers or 3 min long tracks. I wanted them all to be useful to be played at different moments or moods in a night.\n\nWhat are you most proud of with Basement Philosophy?\n\nThe fact that the emotion and musicality comes through in the tracks. I’m not musically trained but even friends who are who have listened to it, are surprised I’m not. That gave me as much of a sense of pride as watching the dance floor react to them when I tested them.\n\nWhat was the most challenging part of getting the album together?\n\nFighting against my own brain, going from this sounds great to this is pish. Basically, the emotions most people who create go through. The stress dreams of having all the wrong tracks being cut on the record, to getting the record back and there’s no hole in the middle, to the tracks all having someone chatting over them and it being unplayable. There’s loads more I won’t bore you with 🙂\n\nWhat made you choose Alien Communications as home for the LP?\n\nI’m friends with Simon Bays who owns the label, and he put out a previous 12” I’d done called ‘Movements In Mind’.\n\nI love how much he’s all about the music and how much work he puts into the label. He genuinely cares about it, and that comes across.\n\nAcid Rain. What a track! Have you tested it out in the club yet?\n\nYeah! That’s been well rinsed, it goes down well every time. It’s great for transitioning from playing deep to let’s start going through the gears.\n\nThe first time I played it in the club it was about 12.30 and the dancefloor was slow building up that night as the bars were still open at 1am. I mixed it in, then had to run to the toilet as nerves and too many beers got the better of me. When I came back out the acid line was in full flow, and the dance floor had become packed. I thought… Wow. Still smiling thinking about it."
