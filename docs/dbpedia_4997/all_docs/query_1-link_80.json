        "text": "• McGill’s Group will take ownership of the business from 19 September\n\n• Both businesses pledge to put all staff and customers at the forefront of their plans\n\nFirst Bus has agreed to sell its First Scotland East business and all its routes in the area to McGill’s Group.\n\nThe sale, which will complete later in September, includes all First Bus depots in Livingston, Larbert, Bannockburn and Balfron, as well as the Edinburgh open-top bus operation Bright Bus Tours. It also includes all buses which currently operate in the region and approximately 550 staff.\n\nFirst Bus will remain a strong presence in Scotland with its long-established businesses in Aberdeen and Greater Glasgow and is concentrating on driving passenger recovery and growth across both networks following the pandemic. This includes supporting customers with innovative pricing and ticketing options and the introduction of new technology such as Tap On Tap Off in Glasgow and Tap & Cap in Aberdeen.\n\nFirst Bus is making great strides towards its commitment to a fully zero emission fleet by 2035. This includes £35m investment in green transport, in partnership with Transport Scotland, at its Scotstoun and Aberdeen depots.\n\nDuncan Cameron, Managing Director of First Bus Scotland, said: “I’d like to thank our employees for their continued hard work to deliver the best experience possible for our customers across the First Scotland East business. We will be supporting them fully as they transfer to their new employer.\n\n“This sale is part of a strategic refocusing of our Scottish businesses with significant investment in zero emission buses in Glasgow and Aberdeen. We’re pleased that McGill’s, who are a trusted Scottish bus operator brand, will take the Scotland East business forward and wish them every success.\n\n“We will continue to operate our services as usual until the handover date, working closely with McGill’s and with our local authority partners, and continuing our commitment to our customers through the service we offer them.”\n\nOwned by leading Scottish businessmen Sandy and James Easdale, McGill’s has invested heavily in its business and services, including the recent purchase of Xplore Dundee from National Express and its partnership with international coach operator FlixBus for longer distance routes."
