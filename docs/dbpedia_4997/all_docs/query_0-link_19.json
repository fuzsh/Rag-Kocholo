        "text": "I haven't run a Skye based workshop for the best part of ten years and it is certainly not because it has nothing to occupy the devoted landscape photographer, quite the opposite.\n\nThere are probably more Class 1 epic landscape locations on this relatively small Scottish island than just about anywhere in the UK. Names such as Elgol, Fairy Pools, Quiraing and the Old Man of Storr immediately roll off the tongue. Unfortunately its world class status has made it increasingly popular such that the local infrastucture just can't really handle it.\n\nFortunately photographers tend to avoid the months when most of the tourists and holiday makers descend on the island, unfortunately that is precisely when the island tends to shut down and the hotels close their doors until it starts up again the following Easter.\n\nA more creative approach was needed not least because of the dramatic increase in the pricing and scarcity of available options, to that end I am trying out something new. A privately owned rental property the Skye Bay in a dramatic location with an eye wateringly lovely view in a prime location for accessing most of the islands scenic highlights near Portree. It is modern, has TV and even has WiFi, (not always an option on Skye). After a hard days shoot, starting pre-sunrise and finishing post sunset, the last thing in the world I want to do is prepare a meal, I suspect my guests feel the same, they just want to be fed and watered, then chill before repeating the same the following day. Hence the catered option, namely my wife, Hilary, she enjoys cooking and has very kindly agreed to provide breakfasts and an evening meal during the course of our stay, which certainly helps to address the inherent costs of staying on Skye.\n\nIf you are interested then please do follow this LINK to the December 2024 Skye workshop on my website.\n\nThere are just THREE places available and I suspect they will fill quite rapidly.\n\nThe Skye Masterclass is now FULL\n\nThe Photoshop plug-in Photokit Sharpener by Pixel Genius (sharpening software), is one that I have used for ages and still used until December 2023.\n\nI think its really good and actually more than adequate for my needs. I was forced to abandon it when my old Windows 7 PC became \"unsupported and thus unprotected by Microsoft\" I was dragged kicking and screaming away from my non subscription Photoshop CS5, which frankly did all I ever wanted it to do, effortlessly, simply and reliably from as far back as 2010.\n\nA grumpy old man rant feel free to bypass.\n\nWith considerable trepidation I bought a new faster upgraded PC.\n\nI am now running Adobe Photoshop 2024, and Capture One 23 on Windows 11, with a substantially upgraded and much more expensive graphics card which was necessarily added to my set up. Because of the current fascination for everything AI, apparently it needs hugely more capable and rapid computing power to carryout the tasks related to the new AI related software packages.\n\nHonestly, I didn't feel the need to upgrade from Photoshop CS5, neither did I want to, it's expensive. It's \"subscription\" for everything and I loathe that feeling of being conned year on year. Needless to say because my previous computer is no longer supported, very little of my old software is supported either and none of it will run on the newer PC, forcing me down the subscription and new software route in order to make it work, whether you want it or not.\n\n\"Well it's better, it's faster you Neanderthal\", I hear you say, Granted, I'm in my sixth decade and I still occasionally shoot film on an old Pentax 67II just for the pleasure of it. My new PC may be faster but in my experience it certainly isn't better. Windows 11 strikes me as being glitchy, obstructive and non-intuitive, not to mention bloated with crapware that I just don't want or need.\n\nI am not interested in Cloud based anything, I have no interest in blasting aliens with laser beams or beheading manic goblins with machetes so I certainly don't need gaming in 3D. The Cloud is definitely something I don't require. Trying to get the bloody thing to \"LEAVE ME ALONE\", and not interact with me or my PC in any way seems to be nigh on impossible. Photoshop 2024 also seems to be in a permanent upgrade cycle and crashes with monotonous and infuriating regularity.\n\nI really, really wish I'd stuck with my old Windows 7 PC, Photoshop CS5, Photokit Sharpener, Neat Image Pro (noise reduction software) and retained total compatibility with my Nikon 9000ED scanner which I occasionally fire up on that same old PC in an upstairs bedroom un-connected to the internet. Life was so much simpler and considerably cheaper.... too late now.\n\nRant Over.\n\nFor those interested in using Photokit Sharpener 2, and believe it or not there are still an awful lot of you, the guys at Pixel Genius created this 3 stage sharpening solution; capture, creative and output sharpening for correctly and cleverly sharpening your images. It took into consideration a great many factors, including image size, resolution of camera and what it was output too (ie. inkjet print, contone, webpage etc). I can certainly vouch for the quality of the printed output as I used it for many years as my defacto sharpening routine.\n\nNow the good bit. Pixel Genius no longer exists, but the guys there decided to make the software free to share as a legacy to their former Company. If you Google the web for Pixel Genius I am sure you will find reference to it. There are three available downloads, one for Apple Mac based products, one for 32 bit PC's and one for 64 bit PC's. If it says you need a registration code you have downloaded the wrong version from the wrong website, before Pixel Genius made it free to download. I can only vouch for the 64 bit PC version which runs seamlessly and reliably on my Windows 11 computer in Adobe Photoshop 2024. I am so,so happy about that as I really missed being able to use it, despite the expensive offerings from Topaz AI and On1 which actually seem to me to be filled with artefacts when viewed at 100%. Heh! Photokit Sharpener 2 is free to try, what have you got to lose.\n\nNow the caveat. After investigation into Pixel Genius, particularly on Reddit forums headed \"Pixel Genius is dead\", there was a strong indication that after 2019 Adobe Photoshop would not accept the Plug-in and the plug-in failed to appear in \"Automate\" in Adobe Photoshop. I decided to give it a go anyway and amazingly given my general ineptitude with anything related to computers, after four half hearted attempts, I got it to work, and work just as it did when I was using it in subscription free Photoshop CS5.\n\nHere's how I did it. For Windows 11, and I strongly suspect for Windows 10 as well, hopefully for Apple Mac, and for the current version of Adobe Photoshop 2024 and doubtless some legacy ones too.\n\nFind the website for Pixel Genius - the one that indicates the free software offerings from the originators of Photokit 2 Sharpener. Click on and download one of the appropriate three download options for Apple Mac, Windows 32 or Windows 64 Bit. The appropriate one for me was the Windows 64 Bit option.\n\nFind your Downloaded file and click on the zip file there, in my case it was labelled \"PK-Win64 bit\". Once you have done that you should see a single folder labelled \"PixelGenius Toolbox Plug-in Module\"\n\nNow you have to physically drag this folder to two specific locations where Adobe Photoshop xxxx resides - in my case I am using the current version which is Adobe Photoshop 2024 and its in my C:Drive.\n\nFirst location:\n\nC: Program Files \\ Adobe\\ Adobe Photoshop 2024 \\ Plug-ins\n\nDrag that folder \"PixelGenius Toolbox Plug-in Module\" into Plug-ins.\n\nSecond location\n\nC: Program Files \\ Common Files \\ Adobe \\ Plug-ins\n\nDrag that folder \"PixelGenius Toolbox Plug-in Module\" into Plug-ins.\n\nThats it, all done. Open up your version of photoshop in the usual way, click on an image that you might want to sharpen, look down your side bar for \"automate\" and you should see the following list of items there as:\n\nPhotokit 2\n\nPhotokit Color 2, never used it, don't know what it is or does.\n\nPhotokit Capture Sharpener 2 - Pre sharpening for unsharpened Tiff/jpeg images dragged from camera.\n\nPhotokit Creative Sharpener 2 - Sharpening specific areas of an image.\n\nPhotokit Output Sharpener 2 - Sharpening for desired output media ie. Web, print, Press CMYK etc.\n\nIf it's not there or it doesn't work you can always remove the plug-in folders.\n\nPhotokit Sharpener is a subtle but distinct improvement to the output media. I love it but even if you end up not using it, it unobtrusively sits as a Plug-in and it's free and very quick to use. I am sure there are instructions as to how to use it probably inside the Zip file you downloaded when you extract it. Don't forget to look at the sharpening applied at 100%.\n\nPlease note you do this at your own risk I cannot be held responsible for anything you inadvertently do to your computer that causes it to malfunction.\n\nAt 4pm today Toffee one of two sister Dwarf Lion Head Angorra lop eared bunnies had to be put down by the local vet.\n\nShe was suffering with a deterioating condition whereby her breathing was becoming increasingly laboured due to a condition of Osteomyelitis, a bone infection around the nasal passage and lower jaw exacerbated by a dental abscess. Sadly Toffee is no more, outlived by her sister Fudge both having shared our home with us and our two children Ben and Lauren for eight and a half years bringing us huge amounts of joy, entertainment and pleasure.\n\nFudge and Toffee are completely different but both are very gentle and both had one other thing in common, they each completely adored the other and became completely inseparable.\n\nToffee was basically larger, hairier and of course the colour of toffee. She was a bit of a grumpy girl and really quite a smart wee Madam, she always wanted everything done for her, whenever she wanted it done, whether by humans or by rabbit, (Fudge). She would prod the water bottle with her nose and wait there for someone to squeeze it to get an increased flow of water that she could guzzle. She would demand feeding when she felt it was time by wandering out into the kitchen and sit and stare at you until one or other of us got the message and produced food for them.\n\nFudge bless her heart was quite different in the words of that advert on the telly, \"there's not much going on under the bonnet\", Fudge sad to say is really quite outstandingly thick, this doesn't make her any less loveable, quite the opposite, as surrogate parents we felt compelled to take care of her, make sure she got her share of the food and water, (not that Toffee would deny her anything anyway). Fudge is petite, less hairy, mottled in white and brown and she licks everyone, Toffee, us and any visitors, with a hot wee pink tongue. Toffee would tolerate our affections but she just loved the attention that Fudge would lavish on her. Fudge simply craved the attention of everyone whether rabbit or human. As for us we loved them both equally.\n\nNow Toffee's light has gone out I am grateful for one thing, having two rabbits that adore each other was the best choice we could have made, they have spent eight and a half happy years together but when one of them dies, what happens to the other? Personally I am content that Toffee died first for I am convinced that whilst Fudge might just cope without Toffee, I am quite sure that Toffee would have pined away without her Fudge.\n\nThat same evening Hilary, myself, Lauren and Ben solemnly carried Toffee out to a wee grave dug in the back garden by a favourite tree, she was placed gently inside and her grave carefully filled in. We said our goodbyes to her, tearfully hugged each other and reminisced the joyous memories that they both had given us over the years looking through some of their photographs together, some of which you can see HERE. I hope you enjoy them.\n\nWelcome everybody to my new all singing all dancing but fundamentally the same Transient Light website.\n\nAs of the beginning of January Adobe discarded its Plug-In Adobe Flash Player leaving me unable to play a rotating slide show of Transient Light images on my header page and also affecting the uploading of any new images. Over the Christmas period I have been very busy working with my website provider transferring the old site into something a bit more modern that is able to offer the same facilities but with much larger and fully scaleable images that show off the Transient Light pictures on my website for whatever platform it is viewed on at a resolution pertinent to the hardware used, be that iphone, ipad, small low res monitors or all singing all dancing retina screen monitors. That has involved the removal of the smaller low res images and replacing them with the same images but of a larger size for much more enjoyable viewing, time consuming yes, incomplete, I'm afraid so, call it an ongoing process.\n\nSome items will inevitably not link up properly. Print sizes for the moment should be taken with a pinch of salt or at least queried by common sense clearly a square image should not be offered for sale as a 40 inch x 20 inch acrylic. Please do CONTACT me if you want to purchase a print and what you see for offer makes no logical sense.\n\nI hope you enjoy what you see and be assured I will try to iron out everything over the next couple of months maybe the lock down might prove useful after all.\n\nJust a little bit more information on how to move around the galleries.\n\nOnce you have selected the gallery that you think you might like to look at click on the image and you will either see further sub-galleries relating to that gallery choice, or you will see a page of images that you can then click on again to view.\n\nHaving reached that stage you should be confronted by an enlarged image and several options that allow you to buy those images beneath, and of course I will be delighted if you do, (I remind you of the caveats above). But lets face it most folk will want to browse other images or look at the largest available version of the selected image and that option, if available, (it will be in due course), is directly beneath the gallery image \"Larger View\".\n\nOne of the most pleasing ways to browse the selected gallery or sub gallery is to click on \"view slide show\", hopefully you will be seduced by a plethora of related gallery images and be so intoxicated that you will feel compelled to buy one, two or maybe more. They do look amazing in print; well I would say that wouldn't I!\n\nIt is easy though perhaps not intuitive to migrate back to the gallery or sub-gallery of images at any time by stopping the slide show and clicking on that gallery image.\n\nLastly if you are looking for a particular subject, theme, area, region or name of a specific image it is helpful to use the website SEARCH system on the HOME PAGE, though I loathe key wording with a passion I am very grateful I did it right from the very beginning, as it works pretty well and it is a good way of tracking down a particular image inside my fairly capacious library of images.\n\nHave fun and all the best wishes for a much improved New Year.\n\nI am not a frequent blogger, nor do I usually feel the need to inflict my wayward musings on others, under normal circumstances I don't really have the time, but Covid 19 has changed all that with daily life still stumbling along between localised lockdown and an umbrella of uncertainty.\n\nTrue Moray is still largely unaffected. There has been no Covid related deaths in Moray since the last outpouring of frustration (otherwise known by me as a blog). It remains at 20 and has done since early June. Never-the-less that under current of fear still reigns and the previous normality is far from restored. So here it is, another blog and it centres around one extraordinary evening when I arranged to meet up with Jim Robertson a local landscape photographer for a wee evening excursion. The location, date and time were left vague because the weather hadn't exactly been kind. We had half heartedly agreed to meet up on Wednesday evening on 2nd September, Jim was more enthusiastic than me, it was apparently clear and bright at Lossiemouth, whilst I at Forres was looking at another deluge. After umming and aahing a bit longer we decided that Findhorn would be the venue and 6.45pm the meet up time with sunset around 8pm. It was apparent as soon as we got there that the sky was highly active with multiple layering of different types of cloud and even at this early stage I could see that the clouds exhibited an underbelly glow suggesting that a half decent sunset was at least a strong possibility.\n\nFindhorn has an immensely large sandy beach and at low tide which had already been taken into account, we knew there would be multiple channels in which water would sit amongst rippled tan coloured sand. Despite it's proximity to Forres it usually isn't very busy there so we hoped to have it very much to ourselves, we didn't - but Findhorn bay at low tide does have that ability to absorb people. Findhorn bay looks North across the Moray Firth, it is famous for its dolphin population. To the West is Inverness and to the East is the spit of land that forms Burghead. The beach itself is backed by low lying dunes and the river Findhorn discharges over a considerable estuary to the sea West of the footpath leading from the car parking area. Due to it's North coast facing position both sunrise and sunset can be enjoyed at Findhorn bay from late Spring to early Autumn, two bites at the cherry so to speak.\n\nLittle were we to know of the visual banquet that Findhorn was about to bestow upon us on this particular Wednesday evening in September but suffice it to say those that were on the beach at Findhorn at and beyond sunset, (and very few people left until the end of the show), were standing looking, pointing or trying to shoot selfies skyward with mouths and eyes wide open. It really was like a very fine three or four course meal, a banquet no less. I have included a few of the images in the recent uploads but if you would like to see the full progression of images and how it develops from 6.45pm to around 9.00pm taken on Wednesday 02 September 2020 at Findhorn bay then you can view them HERE. Included within that was the most bizarre and still unexplained lighting featuring inverted greenish crepuscular rays apparently from a light source on the horizon in the direction of Burghead, very rare mammatus clouds, (admittedly past their prime), a raging and turbulent sunset sky, extraordinary but genuine cartoonish coloured light and just before the end a spindle of rapidly rotating cloud (not pictured), which we both simultaneously agreed might well be a funnel cloud.\n\nI hope that you enjoy the photographs and to think we almost called it off lucky Jim was keen to give it a whirl, I have rarely felt more visually \"stuffed\".\n\nWell nearly and possibly temporarily but for the moment there is at last an awakening of the dormant hedgehog, Scotland. For the first time it's wee snout has sniffed the scent of summer air, wrinkled its nose, opened its watery eyes and sneezed, not because of Coronavirus but simply it's allergy to the great outdoors, hay fever. During the first two weeks of July everything in the garden will be lovely and as such our glorious leader has announced that all is well, (though we do still have to prod everything with a 2m barge pole). I have always been quite keen on statistics, my wife is after all a medical statistician. Moray council has a hundred thousand people living in it, population density is not high and I daresay if you asked the general public to identify Moray on a map of the UK very few would be able to make a decent prod at it with the aforementioned barge pole.\n\nTo be quite honest save for the quite correctly imposed initial precautionary lock down and the daily bombardment of media lead news, government statistics and the very vague and un-enforceable rules and regulations that the local Police long ago abandoned any hope of upholding, I could easily believe the virus itself was nothing more than a myth. Moray and indeed most of Northern Scotland have seen very low infection rates and mercifully few deaths, as far as I am aware there has been 20 attributed to Moray and a total of 86 confirmed cases. Highland too has been fortunate with very similar percentages, it covers a massive area and has a population of 235000, sadly 49 folk have died with 209 confirmed cases.\n\nHeart warming it is not, but it does feel like its time to come out of hibernation, Scotland has always relied on its tourist industry and it needs to welcome folk back with diligence and care but welcome they must and should be. It is time to come out from beneath mother's skirt of invincibility, life is for living and I cannot wait to start getting out to the mountains, lochs and coastline of the Scottish Highlands to once again confirm to the world that we live in a place with scenery that is quite simply world class and from 03 July I shall be doing just that and I doubt I will see another soul save for those that have snipped mother's apron strings.\n\nI'm bored, very bored, so bored that this is arguably my first ever Blog. Yes I know, that's how bored I am, and I guess you're bored too because your still reading this. Since I can't go out much further than my garden other than for exercise I thought I would entertain you with my latest rabbit pictures. Toffee and Fudge are 8 years old and absolutely adore each other. Toffee the brown one is independent, strong willed and just a wee bit grumpy. Fudge is the white and brown one she is very thick, licks everyone and everything and will happily sit on your knee, shoulder or wherever you put her for pretty much as long as you wish. Where Toffee leads Fudge follows.\n\nWith the exception of a healthy interest in the purchase of Transient Light prints and a few other miscellaneous outlets business has essentially dried up. We are I guess all sitting at least two metres apart confined in our homes, twiddling our thumbs and desperately trying not to succumb to the vacuum of day time TV or the stream of depressing Covid 19 daily death reports.\n\nA little bit of news for those that don't know, I recently moved house, actually we moved quite literally the day before lockdown was announced. We are fortunate to have a large garden of around 0.75 acres and our new (old) house built at the turn of the 20th century was the Old Excise House at the Dallas Dhu Distillery in Forres. The distillery itself is no longer a working distillery but it does have a tiny visitor centre, runs the occasional tour and sells off some of the special reserve bottles periodically (not at the moment of course). The distillery is a grade A listed building and as such nothing new is allowed to be built within direct line of site of it. Some how our property which is within the curtilage of the distillery escaped listing, though we were subsequently informed it should have been as it too was deemed to have been built by the distillery architect Charles Doig. This was great news for us as renovation was not subject to the minefield of Hysterical Scotland listed building constraints which would otherwise have resulted in us not buying the old house and likely as not seen it fall into total ruin. As it is we have tried to keep its appearance on the outside as similar as possible to the original countenance and modernised the inside for 21st century living, with regard paid to the original quality features that were already there and in relatively decent condition. We are very pleased with it and of course we hoped to be doing more work on it during the summer at least that was the plan before we were told even mowing your lawn or carrying out simple DIY is a risk too far.\n\nWith all the negative aspects of Covid 19 being constantly aired and wallowed in by the media I thought I might mention a few ironic positive things I have noticed.\n\nBefore the virus took hold there were only two things that the media held onto like a rabid dog with a bone, that was Brexit and saving the planet. I suspect like most folk here in Britain you have had a belly full of the former. Regardless of your own personal views, the political bickering, lies and point scoring showed all political persuasions during televised media interview and question time to be a total disgrace. I have only ever voted for a candidate that I felt deserved my vote. Not one of them met that most basic criteria, I didn't vote. Happily Brexit has for the present been banished from peoples minds.\n\nSecondly there is that tiny little issue about saving the planet. It appears human beings have been turning the Earth into a gigantic dustbin, understandably its a wee bit disgruntled. Oh the nations of the Earth collectively say how terrible it is and their G7, 8 10,12, 20 (or whatever number we are currently up to), are all terribly concerned, except Trump of course at least he's genuinely disinterested. Their representatives leap on to 1st class jets, quaff champagne, wine or beer, discharging great plumes of pollutants from their rear ends, (the aircraft, not the occupants, that's just hot air), they argue the toss for a few days and return having agreed to disagree about everything until the same time the following year. Well the Earth it appears has had enough, it's been feeling pretty lousy for decades, \"about time I took some effective medicine and got rid of this nasty infection, Covid 19 should do the trick\". Honestly, with far too much time on my hands and little to do other than applaud the NHS, it is difficult not to believe the planet is fighting back and taking care of itself. You reap what you sow.\n\nApparently the air globally is already cleaner than its been for years. Cities and towns are clear of smog and the usual clouds of pollutants, no cars, no planes, no trains, no industry, (Britain doesn't have much of that anyway). We as a nation have rarely been fitter, those that are well enough to go outside are reveling in their permitted hour of exercise. I now live adjacent to the Dava Way an old railway track which had been reclaimed as a public footpath. Before Covid 19 I rarely saw more than a few folk amble by, now it's the equivalent of the M1, I have never seen so many people about and I seriously doubt there are two metres between them all. Folk are running, walking, cycling, engaging with their kids indoors and out. Junk food outlets are nominally closed, people are baking their own bread and getting creative with craft related projects courtesy of their excess toilet rolls. Venice one of the most beautiful yet hideously polluted cities in the world has had an ethical renaissance, the water is clear and blue with jellyfish swimming by, (personally I could do without the jellyfish).\n\nThe above are just my musings and thoughts in one of several bored and admittedly frustrated moments where I feel imprisoned in a house and being told to sit on my arse when I believe I would be both safer and happier out with a camera alone in Scotland's great outdoors. As you are doubtless aware the government ramble on about recovery and a cautious return to normality. I do wonder if they have the faintest idea of how they are realistically going to achieve that goal or even if they should, perhaps this ought to be considered an opportunity to re-construct a new normality one that is not parasitic but symbiotic with its relationship to planet Earth particularly as it seems to hold all the cards.\n\nTo paraphrase an old classic, I too am now out of Africa.\n\nFor a considerable time now I have been mulling over the disturbing possibility that the human trade in such products as ivory and rhino horn and the general indifference on display in respect of animal conservation, typically trophy hunting of some of the most spectacular animals on planet Earth, could mean that my children and future generations might never get the opportunity to see such awesome animals as lion, giraffe, elephant, leopard and rhino outside of the sanitised and false environment of a zoo.\n\nTwenty one years ago my wife and I underwent a backpacking trip around the globe lasting a year and a half starting in South Africa shortly after Nelson Mandela took charge. We marvelled at our encounters with these animals which weren't just on show in game reserves, but just as likely witnessed at the side of a road. In Britain the largest animal we regularly come across is a red deer stag, but even so homosapien is undoubtedly king. Now I don't know about you, but if a large bull elephant were to amble across the road in front of me I personally think it sensible to defer to the elephant and that would hold true in respect of any of the so-called Big 5 and a few other beasts beside. Man seems a just a little bit insignificant and in the case of lion and leopard a bit further down the food chain.\n\nSo earlier this summer commencing 23 June my wife and I decided that we would once again visit Africa and this time travel overland for 21 days through South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe to give our children the opportunity and thrill of seeing some of these endangered animals up close and personal as we did so many years before, wild camping in the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park to mention just two.\n\nWe did indeed walk with elephants in hushed heart stopping silence beneath the cool splendour of a pink twilit sky and we thrilled to the subsonic bass roar of lion outside our tents whilst barely daring to breathe cursing silently at the noise our furiously beating hearts were making.\n\nPlease do have a look through the Africa galleries, I used the little Fuji XT-1 and 55-200mm lens for most of them and the landscapes were largely done on the Pentax 67II film based camera"
