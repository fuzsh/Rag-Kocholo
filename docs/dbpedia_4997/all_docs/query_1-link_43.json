        "text": "Have you ever been on a plane when suddenly the plane becomes unsteady in the air, swaying side to side and bumping up and down? Turbulence can occur on any flight and is quite normal and usually without any consequences. However, although it is normal, it still causes passengers concern and stress, especially those with a fear of flying or first-time flyers.\n\nWhat causes turbulence?\n\nTurbulence occurs when a plane travels through a patch of 'rough air'. Normally, planes travel on smooth flows of wind. However, sometimes these winds can have waves in them or disturbances to them, meaning the plane goes up and down and side to side in line with these interferences.\n\nThis rough patch of air can happen for a number of reasons and can occur anywhere from ground level up to above cruising altitude. Some of the most common causes include mountains, jet streams and storms, or any other ways the airflow can be pushed up or disrupted. For example, when smooth flows of air hit large objects such as mountains, it has nowhere to go but up, therefore adding disruption to a patch of air.\n\nJet streams\n\nThe jet streams are another area which often results in turbulence. Jet streams are fast-flowing air currents, with the strongest on Earth being the polar jets. Because these streams of air are often narrow and bending with different speeds of air, there is often turbulence associated when coming in or out of the jet streams.\n\nThunderstorms\n\nAnother reason why turbulence commonly occurs is because of thunderstorms. The way in which storm clouds form means air is pushed away rapidly, causing air to move in a different direction and thus waves in the atmosphere. This means that turbulence can occur as a result of a storm, but a few hundred miles away from the actual storm, making the encounter of turbulence less predictable.\n\nOther aircraft\n\nAn uncommon reason, yet still possible, for turbulence, is by flying in the 'wake' of another plane. This is similar to boats and waves on water, where the water is disturbed by a big and fast boat, causing the other boats to bob up and down on the waves. This is what happens in the air when large and fast aircraft disrupt the air nearby. This is usually avoidable by careful planning and monitoring, meaning that planes often don't get close enough in the air to cause this.\n\nWear your seat belt\n\nAlthough this may seem obvious, many passengers still don't wear their seatbelt when the seatbelt signs go off, meaning people often fall asleep and have to be woken up if the plane encounters turbulence. Even wearing your seatbelt loosely can prevent you from moving around in your seat and prevent injury.\n\nUnderstand why\n\nMost people find that once they have read guides like the one you're reading which explains what turbulence is and why it happens are much better with turbulence the next time they encounter it. This is because when you know what is happening, rather than just worrying about the possibilities of meanings when your plane lurches through the sky, you'll be less likely to worry.\n\nPlan your flight around the aircraft\n\nDid you know that some models of newer aircraft are better at preventing the effects of turbulence, with bigger planes often coping with rough patches of air much better. You can look up the model of the plane that you will be flying on during the booking process at Alternative Airlines - see how here. You can even use our Aircraft Filter to not show flights operated by specific aircraft models.\n\nMention your anxiety\n\nIf you suffer from a fear of flying and turbulence, it may be worth going to your doctor about it as they may have some anxiety management techniques for you to try out when flying. Similarly, it may be worth mentioning it to the flight attendants, so that they will be able to check on you if turbulence occurs."
