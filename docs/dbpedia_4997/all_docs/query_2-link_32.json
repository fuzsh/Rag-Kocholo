        "text": "Whisky has simple ingredients: barley, wheat or rye, yeast and water. The Scots drink it straight or with a dash of water.\n\nBut the drink is also complex. There's an abundance of different 'cask strengths', 'blended malts', and 'single grains'. Take a tour and learn the nuances.\n\nWhisky makers say distilleries are in remote locations because of fresh water sources. But this isn’t always true.\n\nIn the 18th century, distillers relocated to avoid tax collector routes. This was bad for distillers, but it’s great if you want to enjoy a dram near a delightful view.\n\nThe Water of Life\n\nMany of Scotland’s literary legends were influenced by the taste of whisky. Robert Burns penned entire poems in the drink’s honour.\n\nFind out why the Scots call it ‘The Water of Life’ and you may be inspired to write a verse or two yourself.\n\nDriven by curiosity\n\nOn small group tours, we all want to understand more. See from other points of view. Not satisfied by ‘top sites’ and tick-list routes, we find the stories that go deeper and live longer in your mind.\n\nStories take us places\n\nOur guides live and breathe places so you can too. They share did-you-knows and real-life memories that make the best stories. And leave time for you to stumble across your own.\n\nGo beyond\n\nFrom booking to disembarking, our team’s there for every ‘how?’ and ‘what’s next?’. Guaranteed departures. Guaranteed experience, or your money back.\n\nWe care about out there\n\nTogether, we move travel forward. We offset carbon, preserve footpaths and guide you to pitstops owned by locals. Connecting people and protecting places we love."
