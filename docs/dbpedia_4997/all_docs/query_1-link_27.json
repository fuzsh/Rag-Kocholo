However some families with kids were pretty distressed.\"\n\nMs Pettigrew said she was not aware how serious the incident was until they got into the terminal and heard people talking about what had happened.\n\nShe added that the air crew on board the plane were \"amazing\".\n\n\"They kept everyone calm,\" she said. \"The pilots seemed to do a smooth job of getting us down safely. Apparently the cabin crew were preparing for a crash landing.\"\n\nThe Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they were in attendance to help airport fire crews.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"We were requested at 11:23 to assist our fire service partners at Prestwick Airport.\"\n\n\"Operations Control mobilised four appliances to the site, where firefighters remain working to support their partners.\""
