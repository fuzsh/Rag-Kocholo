        "text": "The Edinburgh International Film Festival gave a world premiere to Big Gold Dream: The Sound of Young Scotland 1977-1985, directed by Grant McPhee. The film charts the story of a ground-breaking post-punk music scene which existed in Edinburgh at the end of the 1970's and of the extraordinary influence of the Fast Product record label in Edinburgh. Bob Last (pictured) challenged the mainstream music industry by setting up Fast Product in 1977 propelling a number of influential groups in the vibrant Edinburgh music scene at the time, from his flat in Leith, Edinburgh. All pictures by Ivon Bartholomew\n\nThe film's writer, Innes Reekie, poses with old friend, Jo Callis, guitarist for the Rezillos and The Human League, who appears in the film, alongside a host of musicians from the influential post-punk music scene.\n\nBluebells frontman Ken McCluskey, who had hits such as Young at Heart and I'm Falling in the 1980's, took part in a Q&A session after the film.\n\nAlan Campbell, manager of influential Edinburgh band Josef K , from 1979-1982, attended the screening. Leaving the Fast Product label, the band crossed the east-west divide, to give Glasgow's Postcard Records their first album release, The Only Fun in Town, which reached No 3 in the indie charts."
