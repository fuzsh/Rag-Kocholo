        "text": "Michael Jackson came to Scotland just once as a solo artist - and was banned from coming back.\n\nMore than 35,000 fans went wild when the superstar played gig on Glasgow Green in August 1992 as part of his DangerousT our.\n\nBut council chiefs later said he would not be welcomed back to the city after a deluge of complaints about the noise.\n\nThe gig began with Jacko - dressed in a gold lame bodice and black leggings - being catapulted 20ft through the air on to the stage from a trapdoor as fireworks exploded.\n\nHe then stood motionless for two minutes observing his ecstatic fans before saying: \"How ya' ... doin'. I love you.\"\n\nHit after hit followed as Jackson bodypopped and moonwalked through songs, including Billie Jean, Thriller and Smooth Criminal.\n\nHe then appeared to rocket off on a jetpack, soaring 100ft over the crowd.\n\nPop writer Billy Sloan - who pronounced the gig one of the greatest concerts in Scottish pop history - later revealed in the Record that the feat was actually performed by a stuntman.\n\nFan Garry McConnachie, 29, saw his hero when his mum's pal took him to the gig. He said: \"I can still picture things clearly. After Jacko took to the stage in style, he then appeared on a jetpack. I found myself next to a man uncontrollably sobbing at the sight.\n\n\"The Dangerous Tour was something to behold as he fired through a range of hits from old favourites Don't Stop Til You Get Enough and Bad to tracks from the tour album such as Black or White, Who Is It? and Remember The Time.\n\n\"It's an occasion that will live with me forever. He was a real showman and always gave the crowd exactly what they wanted.\n\n\"A musical genius has been lost and the music world will be worse without him.\"\n\nDuring the concert, however, the Record switchboard was flooded with calls from local residents complaining about the noise.\n\nCouncillors later said the star wouldn't be allowed back for any more concerts.\n\nHe had appeared in the city years earlier when The Jackson 5 played a Royal Variety Performance in 1977.\n\nThe Jacksons had to cancel a gig at Glasgow's Apollo in June 1974 because angry mums said they feared for their children's safety.\n\nAnother gig with his brothers in 1979 was cancelled because Michael fell ill on a plane on the way to the venue."
