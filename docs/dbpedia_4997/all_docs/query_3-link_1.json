        "text": "Giving Lost The Benefit of the Doubt\n\non •\n\nI’ll be the first to admit it, my Battlestar Galactica review earlier in the week took a lot out of me. It was an emotionally draining experience. I don’t find it easy to come down against shows that I usually… Read More ›\n\nProject: ALF Or, How To Fricasee a Cat in 10 Easy Lessons\n\non •\n\nFor those of you that are unaware, ALF is an alien life form. Actually, not only is ALF an alien life form, but ALF stands for Alien Life Form, which is probably why he’s called ALF (except when he’s called… Read More ›\n\nBattlestar Galactica’s Season Finale… What the Frak?!?\n\non •\n\nLet’s get something straight right off the bat, people: simply having a pretty good cliffhanger at the end of an episode, particularly a season finale, doesn’t make up for boring the audience for the previous 45 minutes. That’s right, today… Read More ›\n\nOh to be a Football Mogul\n\non •\n\nI love my fantasty sports. Not to a ridiculously insane degree, but I do. Let’s face it, people love their fantasy sports. They’re obsessed with it. As computing power grows, it seems that more and more of it is devoted… Read More ›\n\nGet Me Maxwell Smart!\n\non •\n\nMany moons ago, I told how I had received a short screener, touting some of the elements of Time-Life’s upcoming Get Smart: The Complete Collection DVD. I said something along the lines of that if the DVD collection was as… Read More ›\n\nReigning in Raines’s Imagination\n\non •\n\nThere I was last night watching Raines and wondering why. I’m just not sure I get it. Goldblum is good, but he’s playing, roughly, the guy he always plays. He’s sarcastic, sardonic, and generally an ass. My kind of guy. … Read More ›\n\nMy New Rule of Thumb: Never Give a Sucker an Even Break\n\non •\n\nW.C. Fields is a legend, a classic, one of the father’s of film comedy. He is oft parodied, oft remembered, and much loved. Starting in Vaudeville and making his way to Hollywood early in its existence, Fields found success in… Read More ›\n\nLost is Rich, The Riches are Lost, and Battlestar Galactica Barely Is\n\non •\n\nI just watched Monday’s episode of The Riches and I’m still not sure how I feel about the show. Everything about it screams “this is good TV,” at least everything except for the way the story is unfolding. I’m sorry,… Read More ›\n\nMonday Night TV: It’s All Lies\n\non •\n\nLet’s discuss lies, shall we. Working backwards, it was a huge issue on The Black Donnellys last night, in fact, it was such an issue that the episode was entitled “Lies.” I wonder though if they’re headed entirely too close… Read More ›\n\nTV, Where We Are Now\n\non •\n\nAs we approach the end of March, it seems to me like a wonderful time for taking stock, seeing where we are in the television world. There are only about two months left before the end of the season, and… Read More ›\n\nHooking in an Audience\n\non •\n\nYou want an idea for a hook? Here’s an idea for a hook: no hook, just good writing and good characters. Can we just avoid nonsense for a little while and concentrate on doing things well rather than having a… Read More ›\n\nAn Embarrassment of Riches\n\non •\n\nLike OMC once sang — how bizarre, how bizarre. A 24 episode that goes extra-light on the helping of Jack Bauer. It’s just weird. It was a good episode, but weird. And, I can’t be the only person that wants… Read More ›\n\nSchooling the Little Ones: Baby Einstein – My First Signs\n\non •\n\nHaving a nine-month-old child, I have an excellent handle on Baby Einstein and its myriad products; there are DVDs, CDs, games, toys, furniture-type things, the list goes on, and on, and on. The only thing more impressive than the quantity… Read More ›\n\nTuesday Morning’s Monday Television Night Wrap-up\n\non •\n\nFirst up, let me just say that we’re not going to be talking about The Riches today. We’re just not. Come 10 pm last night I had to make an executive decision, and it was The Black Donnellys that won… Read More ›"
