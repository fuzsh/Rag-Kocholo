        "text": "Hello everyone to my first ever flight report!\n\nWelcome to this trip that took place last month (November 2021) from London Stansted to Glasgow Intl. I decided to go visit Glasgow for the day and due to it being a doemstic flight there was no need for any testing to be done.\n\nI believe this is the first report on this route on FR and I hope I make it worth your time!\n\nMy journey starts from Tottenham Hale waiting for the 0652 Stansted Express. Weather was the typical London weather. Sorry for the blurry image, its hard to get pics before sunrise\n\nStansted express arrived ontime, there was just two stops inbetween Tottenham and Stansted airport. Journey time was 40 minutes\n\nStansted express 12 carriage, built by Swiss company Stadler at Tottenham Hale, November 2021.\n\nI got to Stansted airport for 0730 and had over 90 minutes for my flight depart so I didnt rush the experience and took my time to my gate\n\nStansted Airport, home to multiple carriers\n\nThe FIDS, in the sea of blue there are a couple Easyjet flights\n\nI then decided to head through to security, the overall wait time was no more than 10 minutes. Below is the main FIDS after security at Stansted before you go through duty free.\n\nAs my flight is part of a spin, I already knew what gate I needed to be at by tracking the inbound flight on Flight Radar\n\nGot to the gate nice and early and decided to eat the meal deal I bought from WHSmith. It was a nice day at Stansted with many flights departing.\n\nThe gate finally displayed my flight as I watched people rush to join the queue, I stayed seated until the final ones boarded to get some pics of the plane before departing.\n\nAs with any low cost carrier, there are no jetbridges. You would need to go down the hallway and take the stairs down to the tarmac\n\nMy aircraft below:\n\nAirline: Easyjet\n\nAircraft: Airbus A319-111\n\nRegistration: G-EZBF\n\nAge: 15 years\n\nMy seat today is 16F, I have a thing of only sitting on the right side of the plane, i'm not sure why but I prefer the right side over left side. Anyone else have a peferred side? Might just be me.\n\nMooving on, next to us was Loganair ERJ-145 heading to Dundee\n\nShort Taxi to the active runway and we was already on our way to Glasgow! Its nice to be in the sky again.\n\nWe climbed to our cruising altitude of 31000ft and the Easyjet buy on board was underway. Chose not to purhcase anything and save money for another time.\n\n40 minutes later we started our descend into Glasgow where the weather wasn't great. Beautiful landing, smooth like butter and taxi time from active to stand was no more than 4 minutes!\n\nAfter everyone got off and I asked the cabin crew if I could take a picture of the flight deck. I was suprised they agreed to it as it was a first for me! I spoke to the captain about the flight and where they are heading next before I made my way off the plane thanking everyone and wishing them all the best.\n\nBeautiful Twin Otters below heading into northern Scotland and the Scottish Isles.\n\nTook the airport express 500 bus into the city centre for the day, got a couple decent pictures!"
