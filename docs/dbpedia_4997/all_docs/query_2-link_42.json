        "text": "Know your TV’s signal inputs! Almost every TV today comes with multiple “inputs” where you are able to connect multiple devices such as a GEPB HD/Digital set-top box, Video Streaming Devices (Fire Stick, Roku, Apple TV), Gaming Consoles, DVD Players, etc. In order to verify your cable service is properly working, you will first need to verify you are on the correct input.\n\nTo do this, you will first need to determine if you have a GEPB HD/Digital Cable Box or DTA Alternative Tuner Box. If so, you will need to verify that the box is turned on (blue ring around power button for HD/Digital boxes and green power indicator on DTA). Then you will need to check on the side or back of your television to see what input your cable box is connected to. In most cases, GEPB service technicians will connect the cable box to your TV via the first available HDMI input, if the TV has that input. This will likely be labeled HDMI1 in your TV’s input list. However, if another device is already connected to the first HDMI port, then the next open port will be used. If the TV has multiple HDMI ports, then the box is likely connected to the port labeled HDMI2. If there are no open ports or no HDMI ports at all on the television set, the cable box will then be connected either by component (5 plugs on each end, Red, Green, Blue and Red, White/Black labeled audio) or composite (traditional RCA Red/White/Yellow plugs on each end) cables. This input can be labeled a variety of names on your TV, including but not limited to: Video 1, Comp 1, A/V 1, etc.\n\nThe best way to figure out which input is being utilized by your cable box is to scan through each input after verifying your cable box is properly connected and turned on. You will either use the “source” or “input” button on the remote that came with your TV or you may use your GEPB cable remote by pressing the “TV” button on the input button row close to the top and then selecting the “Video Source” button on the bottom left of the remote. Both of these ways will allow you to toggle onto each input one at a time until you find the cable box input.\n\nIf you have the alternative tuner box (DTA) or a digital box but not an HD TV, your box is connected via the RF connector on your TV and you will need to verify that your TV is on Channel 3.\n\nIf you only have the economy or essential GEPB cable subscription, you do not have a cable box. This means your cable service is directly connected to the RF connector on your TV, and will need to toggle to the input labeled “RF” or “Cable”.\n\nGEPB cable customers with the Economy or Essential cable subscription don’t have a cable box. Instead, cable service is directly connected to the RF cable connector on the TV.\n\nIf you have bought a new TV, you will need to connect the cable coming from the wall to that RF input on the new TV. You will then need to power on the new TV and begin the setup process. Most new TVs will allow you to select where you will be receiving channels from, with options likely labeled “Cable” or “Antenna” or even “CATV” and “Air” being possible labels for the choices. You will need to select the Cable/CATV option and then continue on to for a channel scan. If not prompted to do a channel scan, you will need to access the cable channel settings from your TV’s menu and complete a scan that way. The scan can take as long as 30 minutes depending on the TV. One finished, all cable signals that come with your appropriate GEPB Cable subscription will be available."
