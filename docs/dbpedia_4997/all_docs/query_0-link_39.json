For the big day, Putin opted to stage an informal gathering of\n\nPutin’s Botched Mobilization and Nuclear Non-Option\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s September 21 address to the nation could prove to be one of his most fateful blunders in his disastrous war in Ukraine.

In retrospect, the pitched battle\n\nRussia Cherishes Ambitions but Loses Positions in Middle East\n\nThe Ukraine war has generated shockwaves far beyond the Donbas battlefields, and the Middle East has absorbed and returned the variegated impacts and, as a result, has attracted increased attention\n\nRussian Assault on World Order Falters and Fails\n\nRussia’s attack on Ukraine has clearly lost momentum, but the intensity of its multi-prong confrontation with the West keeps rising.

They are still assessing the\n\nAfter 100 Days, Russian Offensive Crawls Toward Eventual Defeat\n\nRussian military strategists argue that modern wars are decided in the high-intensity initial period; and the multi-pronged large-scale offensive into Ukraine was indeed launched, on February 24, 2022, with the\n\nWill the Closure at Azovstal Plant Steel Ukraine’s Resolve to Keep Fighting?\n\nIn the seemingly deadlocked but, in fact, fast-evolving war in Ukraine, two impactful events coincided in mid-May, altering the course of the battles and political stand-off. The first one was\n\nCould Annexation Be Putin’s Response to NATO Enlargement?\n\nRussia’s aggression against Ukraine has energized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in every possible way, reviving the alliance’s purpose and unity, and granting it new attractiveness in Europe as\n\nOn the Occasion of May 9, 2022, Putin Had Nothing to Say\n\nFor weeks leading up to May 9, Russian President Vladimir Putin was widely expected to announce a major decision during the annual Victory Day military parade on the Red Square.\n\nEscalation of Lies and Threats Leaves Putin With Two Bad Choices\n\nThe deadlocked war with Ukraine has pushed Russia into an irreconcilable dilemma: it can neither accept reality nor keep denying it. This contradiction can be seen both in the official\n\nNo Feasible End-Game for Russia in Badly Mismanaged War\n\nPredictions of a decisive offensive in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas on the one hand, and speculation about peace talks on the other hand, have gained new intensity in\n\nFailure Looms Over Russia’s Decisive Offensive in Donbas\n\nTriumphalist rhetoric coming out of Moscow notwithstanding, Russia’s war in Ukraine is not progressing according to plan (see EDM, April 11). Nevertheless, President Vladimir Putin repeated yet again last week\n\nRussia’s Quick Victory Vanishes, as Protracted War Looks Inevitable\n\nRussia has revised its war plan multiple times during the, so far, seven-week-long, ill-conceived large-scale invasion of Ukraine, yet it still remains incompatible with both tactical imperatives and political ambitions.\n\nPutin’s First Assertive Move on the Energy Front Misfires\n\nCombat operations on all key fronts of the Russo-Ukrainian war continue non-stop, even if without decisive action, but the transit of Russian natural gas to Europe through Ukraine’s pipeline system\n\nRussia’s Strategic Confusion in Ukraine Deepens and Widens\n\nFor at least the past 3 weeks of the 33-day-long war against Ukraine, it has been clear that the Russian offensive has lost momentum, with its key groupings of forces\n\nStalled Military Offensive and Unfolding Political Defeat for Russia in Ukraine\n\nOne striking feature of Russia’s fast-evolving war against Ukraine is the highly uneven dynamics of escalation in its different domains.
