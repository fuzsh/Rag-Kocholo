        "text": "The Glasgow Magistrate is one of our customers' favorite grabba leaves. It's a premier quality, medium-color leaf with a rich texture and nice oil and stretch. Some customers are drawn to the Glasgow Magistrateâ€™s thin veins, and others love its smooth and versatile aroma. This leaf comes from Pennsylvania and is hand sorted by Amish farmers after being air cured.\n\nAir cured tobacco is generally cured in open or exposed barns for one to two months at a time. Thanks to this curing process, these leaves have a distinctive, pleasing aroma. Traditionally, this leaf is a 'dark air cured tobacco' used universally as a binder; however, many leaves may be suitable for use as wrappers.\n\nAs with all of our retail sales, these leaves are unbound and separated from each other. If you'd prefer your order to be untouched and bound together in 'hands' by the farmer, we're happy to accommodate you. Just let us know. Large and wholesale orders are shipped in bound 'hands' of tobacco.\n\nType: Dark Air Cured\n\nOrigin: Pennsylvania\n\nGrade: Binder\n\nAverage length: 23\" long, not including the unusable length of the stem at the bottom of each leaf\n\nAverage width: 10\" at its widest point"
