        "text": "John Darroch is filling in for Dave Marshall for the next few weeks so Tom Bell is filling for John Darroch on his show till Dave is back John is still staying on Saturdays nights.\n\nMust say its my first time hereing Tom Bell he is doing well on Smooth Radio whats every one els think.\n\n0\n\nTom Bell is a Radio Forth legend - used to present the Saturday afternoon sports programme - as well as a number of weekday evening programmes in the 1980s.\n\nHe's a very talented broadcaster from the old school - and will fit perfectly at Smooth.\n\nIs he still on air at Central FM too?\n\n0\n\nyeah, Tom's sounding good on air. Dave Marshall is back from hols next week so John Darroch will probably be returning to his evening slot. Tom would be a good addition to the station though, maybe for Dougie Jackson who sounds totally out of place - don't think many Smooth listeners are interested in news about Beyonce, Pete Docherty, Jordan & the like - more Real than Smooth\\\n\n0\n\nI tuned into Smooth Glasgow last night after reading this thread to listen to Tom Bell.\n\nI used to listen to him on Radio Borders when they took Max AM 1548 (now Forth 2 ) after 7pm. I loved his show then and I was not disappointed last night either.\n\nTom knows his music very well, in fact when he did the evening show on Max AM, he had a competition called 'Beat the Bell', where you would call in with a song title and he would identify the artist. I beat him on two occasions, but he beat me a lot more than that! What a memory he has!\n\nI wish Tom every success at Smooth - He is a radio pro. I will be listening to him on-line a whole lot more now!\n\n0\n\nTom Bell eh...... a Radio Forth heritage presenter that they expect West of Scotland listeners to have an affinity with....\n\nMore evidence of GMG plot and lost I think!\n\nOh for God's sake wavejock!\n\nWhile I agree with much of what you say, I really must call you on this one\n\nThe logic of what you are saying is that the only people GMG can use on Smooth are heritage jocks of old from Radio Clyde.\n\nYes it helps and yes that is what they have done to a great extent but it isn't the be all and end all.\n\nI had a dip into Tom's show tonight and felt he sounded really comfortable. Certainly more comfortable than he did on Central during it's \"Musicfunlife\" era. I suspect few if any Smooth listeners would have had cause for complaint.\n\n0\n\nTom is a superb broadcaster - so what if he used to be on Radio Forth?!!\n\nHe fits the Smooth style like a glove.\n\nHalf of the guys on Clyde and Forth today have come from Tay or Northsound - no big deal is it?\n\n0\n\nTom Bell eh...... a Radio Forth heritage presenter that they expect West of Scotland listeners to have an affinity with....\n\nMore evidence of GMG plot and lost I think!\n\nConsidering he worked at Central, which part of is in Smooth's TSA then surely he has an infinity with some listeners from the West of Scotland.\n\nAdded to that the last time he was on Forth was about 10 years ago....\n\n0\n\nConsidering he worked at Central, which part of is in Smooth's TSA then surely he has an infinity with some listeners from the West of Scotland.\n\nAdded to that the last time he was on Forth was about 10 years ago....\n\nAnyone remember some of Tom's work on Forth in the 80s?\n\nTopside Stateside - a Tuesday evening American chart show\n\nPlay It Again Tam - Thursday night request show\n\nAirplay Action - a chart based on UK radio airplay\n\nThe Gold Cruiser - Saturday afternoon oldies and sport\n\nOk, let me get the anorak off now. I'm frightening myself!\n\n0"
