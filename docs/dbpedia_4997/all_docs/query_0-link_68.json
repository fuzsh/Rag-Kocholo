Many of these short pieces grew out of commissioning projects that doubled as coping mechanisms, and you could hear the stresses etched into their surfaces.\n\nI was most deeply enchanted by the opening selection, “Dissolve, O My Heart” â a piece for unaccompanied violin that keeps trying out new and slightly different harmonies before returning to a single bass note â and by the fierce outbursts and motoric rhythms of “Tooth and Nail.” But all the pieces gloried, even in necessarily compact form, in Mazzoli’s slightly offbeat harmonic language and her gift for inventive instrumental textures.\"\n\nBy Joshua Kosman, San Francisco Chronicle, October 24, 2021\n\nRead the Article…\n\n\"Mazzoli’s compositions may have been short, but they imposed prodigious technical demands. Koh rose impressively to every challenge that Mazzoli had set for her...\n\nIt would probably be fair to say that a program of nine unfamiliar short pieces (followed by an encore) provided the attentive listener with a path along which acquaintance would begin to form. Koh’s mastery of Mazzoli’s technical demands meant that there was always a point of focus. Getting to the music behind the technique, however, required gradual assimilation. In my case I felt that, by the end of the program, I was beginning to appreciate rhetorical elements in Mazzoli’s instrumental music that had been more explicit in my encounter with her opera.\"\n\nBy Stephen Smoliar, The Rehearsal Studio, October 24, 2021\n\nRead the Article…\n\n[Feature] Isolated By Pandemic, Violinist Jennifer Koh Nurtured A New Community Online\n\n\"For her part, Koh says working on Alone Together made her feel less... well, alone.

During her childhood, my mother witnessed horrific violence and experienced overwhelming fear and hunger. Although my familyâs history is a common one for Korean Americans, it is a part of Asian American history largely ignored in this country. But perhaps even less known is what it is like to be an Asian American woman in classical music.\"\n\n\"I have witnessed throughout my career that those of us who are ethnically Asian but were born, raised or trained in America and Europe, are burdened with the belief that musicians of Asian descent are diligent, hard-working and technically perfect â but cannot understand the true essence of music, have no soul and ultimately cannot be true artists. In the beginning of my career, I was told by an influential conductor â who had never heard me play â that I could never be a true artist because he did not understand Chinese music and therefore Chinese people could never understand classical music.\"\n\nBy Jennifer Koh, The New York Times, July 21, 2021\n\nRead the Article…\n\n[Feature] 'Alone Together': Hear About The Project Pairing Together Young And Experienced Composers\n\n\"I remember I met Angelica Negron for the first time â on Zoom â learning her piece, and she was telling me how, it was so horrific, she was just watching Instagram videos of these two dogs who play with balloons. And so her piece is called \"Cooper and Emma,\" and it's based on these two dogs who play with balloons on Instagram. So I think we can kind of see how everybody processed that period. And it's helpful, because I think it was â I think, now, looking back, we realize that there are so many systemic inequities, and I think because most of the composers who were commissioned were either people of color, non-binary or non-gender conforming and women, it was interesting meeting them because I could literally see the systemic inequities when we were speaking and learning about what they were going through at that time.\"\n\nBy Arun Rath, GBH: All Things Considered, July 9, 2021\n\nRead the Article…\n\n[Feature] Strings Magazine No. 301, July/August 2021 issue\n\n\"Jennifer Koh's 'Along Together' project captured the pandemic lockdown experience while amplifying underrepresented musical voices\"\n\nBy Inge Kjemtrup, Strings magazine, No. 301, July/August 2021 issue\n\nRead the Article…\n\n[Feature] âIâm going to create my own doorsâ: In Chicago, Asian women arts heads lead by example\n\n\"I canât help but think of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

It brings you to places you donât experience every day. Thereâs a sense of risk, being completely exposed.

The internationally acclaimed violinist clearly forged a sturdy connection when she made her debut with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic four years ago, since she is returning to play again with the OKC orchestra Saturday night at the Civic Center Music Hall.\"\n\nBrandy McDonnell, The Oklahoman, October 1, 2017\n\nRead the Article…\n\nIn the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Williamsburg Symphony Orchestra\n\n\"[Koh's] credentials were on full display in this WSO performance.

She and I are sitting in her living room, the faint sound of traffic a gentle reminder of the city. Weâve been talking about commissioning and programming as advocacy for diversity over the past several days, and Iâve been bouncing some ideas off of her for this series. Iâm nervousâas I always am before my writing is publishedâand her encouragement to speak about these issues is centering. She continues:...\"It is our responsibility as artists to advocate for artists and composers who happen to be women or people of color. I feel that we as artists and as an industry need to model and advocate for our entire community. And frankly, diversifying programming is the only way that classical music will survive. If our programming does not reflect the diversity of our society, then we are not serving our community and by extension, we are actively making ourselves irrelevant to society.\"\n\nAnne Lanzilotti, New Music Box, July 27, 2017\n\nRead the Article…\n\nJennifer Koh at Aspen Music Festival\n\n\"At Wednesday eveningâs Aspen Philharmonic concert in the Benedict Music Tent, a sparse but attentive audience heard Anna Clyneâs faux-ballet The Seamstress through the patter of raindrops and a few well-timed thunderclaps outside. Natureâs intrusions seemed to enhance the episodic nature of this one-movement violin concerto, played evocatively by Jennifer Koh, for whom it was written and premiered in 2015 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra....English by birth, Irish by descent, Clyne builds the work around an original Celtic-steeped theme. Over its 22 minutes the beguiling pentatonic language undergoes swoops of glissandos by Koh and a range of embellishments in the orchestra, making for a dreamlike work thatâs easy on the ears and prods the imagination. This is a composer Iâd want to hear more of.\"\n\nHarvey Steiman, The Aspen Times, July 21, 2017\n\nRead the Article…\n\nJennifer Koh at Tanglewood Festival\n\n\"The highlight of the program was violinist Jennifer Kohâs brilliant account of Trouble, a concerto by Vijay Iyer, a jazz pianist whose first instrument was the violin. The challenging solo part is lyrical and at other times gritty and slashing. Iyerâs orchestration features a melancholic flute melody in the first of the workâs six movements, rhythmic contributions from percussion, and colorations from high (piccolo) to low (muted tuba).\"\n\nDavid M.
