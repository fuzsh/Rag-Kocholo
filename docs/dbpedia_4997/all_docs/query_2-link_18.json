        "text": "Katatonia\n\nSpecial Guests: Sólstafir + SOM.\n\nVenue: The Garage, Glasgow.\n\nDate: 13th February 2023.\n\nReview & Photos By: Dave Buchanan\n\nWith a stunning new album in their back pocket, the Kings of melancholy return to a packed out Glasgow Garage to show why they are one of the most impeccable live bands on the planet. Joining them on this run of dates, we have Icelandic post-metal band, Sólstafir, and kicking off each show, a band I’ve been itching to see, the ethereal doom pop unit, SOM.\n\nSOM\n\nIf you missed out on The Shape of Everything by SOM last year, then that needs rectified, stat (cheeky plug of our review here).\n\nThe experience of seeing these guys live is just as I hoped it would be. The album shifts seamlessly to the live stage, giving you even more atmosphere and density than I thought possible. Tracks like Animals and Moment sound utterly colossal through The Garage sound system, with the weight of the guitar and bass just sitting right on your chest. But it’s that more ghostly atmosphere that’s dispersed amongst the bands heavier side that really opens up their sound, giving them even more of an imposing size. It’s a shame they were on so early tonight, and the masses hadn’t fully appeared, because I honestly feel that seeing SOM in this environment is the perfect way to experience them.\n\n(4 / 5)\n\nSólstafir\n\nSo, cards on the table. I didn’t know a hell of a lot about Sólstafir before seeing them tonight. I’d had a listen through some of their extensive back catalogue, and could hear that they are fairly difficult to pigeonhole, ranging from Black Metal all the way through to Post-Metal and Post-Rock. An eclectic bunch, it seems!\n\nThe dynamic between the band was also a bit lop-sided, with 2 of the members being fairly animated, and the lead guitarist completely static. I could tell this was obviously just his style, but as a performance, visually, it felt off-balance. That being said, frontman Aðalbjörn Tryggvason is quite the character, and certainly delivered plenty of head-turning moments throughout the set, some entertaining and some just………(long pause)………awkward.\n\nUnfortunately, overall, this just wasn’t for me as a package. There’s clearly talent there, and I generally do like all of the styles they utilised tonight, but at 75 minutes long, their set just didn’t keep me engaged.\n\n(2.5 / 5)\n\nKatatonia\n\nAnd then the countdown was on to finally seeing the Swedish masters of melancholy go to work. I had never seen Katatonia live before, but they’ve been on my bucket list since forever. But with so many great albums, and a plethora of exceptional material to choose from, I knew it was extremely unlikely they could fail here. And they didn’t.\n\nIn all honesty, though, as good as the band were this evening (and they were incredibly tight), the MVP of the night was vocalist Jonas Renkse. His voice was utterly flawless, floating in and out of melodies that sounded just as pristine as they do on CD. Tracks like Atrium, from Sky Void of Stars, were like a masterclass in melody, really highlighting how nuanced and controlled he can be with his voice. Even after 30 years of pushing his voice to the extremes, his tone is still as smooth as it gets."
