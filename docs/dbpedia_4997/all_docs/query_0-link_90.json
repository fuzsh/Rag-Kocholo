It was initially set for a limited run through June 15, 2003. \"So many of the songs were born with the sound—the instruments and arrangements—going along with them. That's the record mentality, and Don (Sebesky) had that foundation. I made some suggestions: I fought real hard for the size of the band, which was influenced by economics and the size of the orchestra pit.\"\n\nOn May 29, Burt Bacharach presented Elvis Costello with ASCAP's highest honor, the Founders Award.\n\nOn November 11, Here I Am: Isley Meets Bacharach was released. Bacharach arranged, conducted and produced the album. When the album made the Billboard Hot 200 chart, the magazine reported it was Bacharach's seventh album to chart and that it had been 36 years and one month since Reach Out charted in October 1967.\n\nOn November 12, the duo appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien.\"\n\nI'd play the piano and listen to Ronnie [Isley] sing \"This Guy's In Love With You\" and think 'Look where this could go.' Just see where the singer leads you because the guy's a great, great singer. So I'd listen to a work tape on a boom box and hear a lick he sang and make a notation ajd just write it into the arrangement. You've got to give Ronnie room. You don't overwrite or get too busy. That's why we couldn't have done 'God Give Me Strength.\" It's too restrictive--too many words. I wanted him to have a reson to move away from the melody....You're privileged if you're good enough to depart from the origial versions, and he's more than good enough--and you want him to! --Burt Bacharach Billboard October 11, 2003\n\nReissues of Bacharach's recordings for the year included What the World Needs Now: Bacharach Classics and Rare Bacharach I.\n\nBacharach appeared on the television show American Idol. with the show's ten finalists.

The song was also licensed for television commercials for Sandals Resorts and the perfume Calvin Klein's Eternity.\n\nAshanti's song \"Rain On Me\" that sampled \"The Look Of Love\" made the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The last Bacharach-David Top 10 was \"Warning\" that sampled \"Walk On By\" in March 1995.\n\nBacharach guested on Chris Botti's album A Thousand Kisses Deep with \"The Look Of Love.\"\n\nDecember 20, 2003, \"McCormick Presents Burt Bacharach Tribute on Ice\" aired.

RobertsonExact publication date unknown\n\nSONGWRITERS REMEMBER BURT BACHARACH\n\nI believe Burt Bacharach to be the heir to Richard Rodgers in the continuity of American songwriting. On the one occasion when I persuaded Burt to play a song by another composer, he played the Rodgers and Hart song Little Girl Blue. It sounded as if it might have been one of his own compositions.--Elvis Costello, The Guardian, December 20, 2023\n\n*******\n\nBefore The Beatles, and before we all popped up and stuck our heads out there, it was Burt Bacharach. He was the reason I started writing songs. The Story Of My Life which he wrote for Marty Robbins, shocked me to my roots. How simple yet sophisticated. I've sung that song a million times.\n\nI realised early on that Burt had a rare genius. He had so much knowledge, but he understood the heart. He would change keys without you knowing it, slip in extra bars, change time - it was all subliminal and brilliant. He dominated what you thought as you went through a song and I just couldn't help but be inspired.\n\nFor me, if I have an idea for a song, it has to ferment. If you wait long enough, the song will be completed in your head or your heart. And that sounds like what Burt and Hal were doing. They would take their time. I understand Burt's preference for getting away from the instrument. I do it too. It gives you total freedom. Emotional freedom, mental freedom, the freedom to bring the melody wherever you want it to go in your head without having a guitar or a piano to establish chords. You want to go somewhere you'd never imagine you would go melodically, and that was Burt's gift.--Barry Gibb\n\n*******\n\nDear Burt Bacharach has passed away. His songs were an inspiration to people like me. I met him on a couple of occasions and he was a very kind and talented man who will be missed by us all. His songs were distinctive and different from many others in the '60s and '70s and when we met not too long ago he reminded me that he had been the musical director for Marlene Dietrich when The Beatles shared the bill with her at the London Palladium. He was a lovely man.--Paul McCartney\n\n*******\n\n“Baby It’s You” by The Shirelles is one of the first songs I remember that Burt Bacharach composed. His music deeply affected me. I could hear his classical training in the cadences, polyrhythms, and arrangements. I was 15 and I was hooked on Burt. He was my school. Bacharach and David were the pinnacle I aspired to.\n\nI studied him and them. I learned about chords from listening to Burt’s songs on the radio. I tried to write like him (listen to my song “The Girl’s Song” by The Fifth Dimension). He was integral to my informal songwriting education.\n\nWhen I was 22 years old and had several hits under my belt, I sent Burt a letter and told him that my songwriting success was born from listening to him. I told in that letter how much I respected him and owed him.\n\nYears later, an acquaintance of mine visited Burt in his NYC apartment; he shared that my letter was hanging by the fireplace in the living room! My hero, my teacher had my letter framed!\n\nNot too long ago, in LA at a George Martin tribute, I was backstage along with Burt as we waited to go on. I asked, “Is it true you have my letter over your fireplace?” He answered, “I sure do”. I put my arm around him, and we sat quietly in our world of song. We were kindred souls that traveled the same road. It was a moment of peaceful silent sharing.\n\n. As life model, a fellow traveler in this creative world, he was something stable and important that I could hold onto. I am bereft at the thought that he isn’t with us anymore. But in the same breath, what a mark he--and Hal and Dionne--made on the world!\"--Jimmy Webb\n\nTop\n\nBURT BACHARACH ON MUSIC\n\nTHE SONG\n\nA song is a very compact form--probably the most compact form. It's supposed to create an emotional response from a listener in two to three minutes time, an emotional response that people can identify with. My idea was always to search for a new way, a fresh way of portraying the emotion. I've always thought of myself more as someone who writes from an emotional point of view rather than a cerebral one.--Bacharach and David, Almo Publications 1978\n\n[A great song is] something that doesn't wear me out, doesn't beat me up. So it's not, you listen four or five times and you love it, and then you say, 'OK, enough with that.' If I get tired of it quicker than I should, I have to rethink it.--At 79, Bacharach Proves He's Got Staying Power. Stewart Oksenhorn. Aspen Times Weely. December 22, 2007.\n\nI never intended to appear introspective. But then, I've never been a consistent writer of up tempo songs. I kind of veer toward ballads and melody. I'm seldom totally positive. Maybe that's because 'she loves you' or 'I'm so happy' don't make for such good songs.--Bacharach to the Future. Paul Lester. Melody Maker. October 21, 1995.\n\nI don't look too much into my life for stuff. They're just melodic fragments. The autobiographical references are irrelevant. They're reflections, generalizations, not specific. I'm like a sponge. I absorb things.... When I'm really moved by something, by a beautiful view, I put that response into the melody. But that's it.--Bacharach to the Future. Paul Lester. Melody Maker. October 21, 1995.\n\nYou can't start out to write a song that will 'resonate the heart'. As a composer the style that's attracted me means you won't see a lot of uptempo tunes. Many of the songs are ballads. I think they're the things I can touch, or want to touch. I've always tried to create in a song form which will translate into a record. Making it like a four-minute movie with highs and lows.--Q&A. Select Magazine March 1996\n\nSONGWRITING\n\nThe best way, for me [to write a song], always is to get away from the piano, sit in a place and hear it in my head. And that's where everything gets born.--NPR, July 3, 2008\n\nPeople will tell me a song sounds great even if it's only mediocre. In the end you have to rely on your own ear. If something isn't right I know it and I have to start again. (B. Bacharach Is Hoping for First Oscar. Linda Deutsch. Associated Press, April 1, 1968.)\n\nIt's very hard for me to sit down and, as I'm writing at the piano, perceive this as a full song, knowing whether it's good or not good. It goes by in inches. If you get away from the piano and hear the melodic contour as well as the harmonisation in your head, you're hearing a long vertical line. I like to take a long look at the song.--Do You Know the Way to Monterey? Santa Fe? Whitley Bay?... Mojo Magazine. March 1996\n\nI do that when I'm orchestrating too. I have to have a long-range picture of he whole scope of a piece. I get a sense of balance that I couldn't get if I was sitting at the piano. Your hands tend to go places because they've been there before. You'll write what your hands can play instead of what an orchestration can play.--Do You Know the Way to Monterey? Santa Fe? Whitley Bay?... Mojo Magazine. March 1996\n\nWhat does happen with me is that I tinker, I fiddle, I've never had a song come to me fully formed in a blinding flash of inspiration. If it comes too easy I don't think it's any good. So I turn it upside down and look at it in the middle of the night. It's a short form, three and a half minutes, so everything counts. You can get away with murder in a forty-minute piece but not in three and a half. Some songs, you know, they beat you up. Too notey, too wordy, too much. You think, I don't wanna hear that again in a hurry.--See You Later, Elevator! Q. July 1996\n\nTIME SIGNATURES\n\nOccasionally there would be 'complaints.' With 'What's New, Pussycat?' someone said, 'This is in 3/4,' it's a waltz, how is somebody in a disco in Paris going to dance to this?' I said, 'They'll find a way. It feels right the way it is. They'll find a way to move to it.' You can't think about things like that. I never bothered counting the bars, about seeing whether or not there were eight bars in the first section. Sometimes there'd be nine bars, sometimes twelve. I never paid any attention. I never paid any attention to a changed time signature. I think it was Dionne who told me the turn-around bar on 'Anyone Who Had A Heart' was in 7/8. She counted it out, and I couldn't believe it. It wasn't intentional, that's just the way it came out.\n\nThose things never bothered me. They bothered some people. An A&R man in the early days might say, 'Here's a three-bar phrase instead of a four-bar phrase, and it really makes me uncomfortable. If you'll make it a four-bar phrase l'll record the song, but the way it is now I won't.' And I did that a couple of times, and I ruined a couple of good songs.--Bacharach and David, Almo Publications 1978\n\nARRANGEMENTS\n\nI started writing my own orchestrations as a kind of self-defense. No matter how good the words or the melody of a song, it has got to be showcased properly.--Hits. Lillian Ross. The New Yorker, September 14, 1968.\n\nWhen any instrumentalist would have a singular statement to make on a record, I'd write a lyric underneath. It might be words that made no sense at all, but it would help them speak through their instrument. There are certain things that can't really be notated in orchestration. It's maybe two eighth notes, a 16th note and another eighth note, and that's the way it should be notated, but that's not the way it totally feels. But if you put words with it, or even vowel sounds, it does make a difference.--Do You KNow the Way to Monterey? Santa Fe? Whitley Bay?... Mojo Magazine. March 1996\n\nSTUDIO MAGIC\n\nYou need that certain magic to happen at a recording session. Much of the feeling of a record—my records—comes from the rhythm section.--Hits. Lillian Ross. The New Yorker, September 14, 1968.\n\nPRODUCING RECORDS\n\nI did it [produce records] out of total self-defense. I saw a lot of songs get distorted, butchered, or changed, and I had to make compromises to people who had the power to let an artist record my songs.--Billboard August 16, 1986.\n\nBACHARACH ALBUMS\n\nI would only sing part of a song. I was afraid to do more. Then the girls would sing the rest. Or I wouldn't have a whole instrumental. If there were key lines I'd use vocal dramatically. Or maybe an English horn, which I'd try to use as judiciously as possible. Then maybe two flugelhorns. There's only so much expression you're going to get out of a lead instrument, so I would try and keep it interesting.--Props for Burt Bacharach. Skip Heller. Pulse Magazine. October 1995.\n\nTHE AUDIENCE\n\nThe biggest thrill for me is being able to make a dent, even a small one, in somebody's life. The reward is when someone tells you one of your songs means something special to them. It might be the memory of a good time, or a love affair, or when their baby was born.--Billboard Jul 25, 1970\n\nI found out doing concerts that you have to be very careful, when you have so much known material, [about] how much new material you can get away with--and where you can get away with it.--Billboard May 3, 2000\n\nTop"
