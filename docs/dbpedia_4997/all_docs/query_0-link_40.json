        "text": "The Convener\n\nAgenda item 2 is evidence on the Scottish Crown Estate Bill at stage 1. In this first evidence session, we will hear from Scottish Government officials on the background to and content of the bill. I welcome David Mallon, who is the head of the Crown estate strategy unit of Marine Scotland; Mike Palmer, who is deputy director in the aquaculture, Crown estate, recreational fisheries, European maritime and fisheries fund and Europe division of Marine Scotland, which is quite a title; and Douglas Kerr, who is a solicitor in the Scottish Government’s legal directorate. Good morning, gentlemen.\n\nLet us kick off by looking at the duties in section 7. How might those duties make a difference to how Crown Estate assets are managed?\n\nDavid Mallon (Marine Scotland)\n\nGood morning. I will kick off by outlining the Scottish ministers’ policy perspective on that. My legal colleague, Douglas Kerr, can add anything else that is worth saying.\n\nThe first thing to highlight is that the duty in section 7 is a reform of the duty in the Crown Estate Act 1961, which requires the manager to “maintain and enhance” the value of the estate\n\n“and the return obtained from it, but with due regard to the requirements of good management.”\n\nHowever, “good management” has never been defined. It has sometimes been interpreted as requiring good stewardship; at other times, it has been interpreted as having the ability to take account of other factors. There are examples of the Crown Estate Commissioners in the past, and Crown Estate Scotland currently, using that second interpretation at small scale, but the existing managers have always been wary about the legal vires of that. Therefore, in thinking about what the long-term framework for management of the Crown estate in Scotland should be, the Scottish ministers have wished to make it more explicit that wider factors—the economic, social and environmental benefits that can arise from decision making—can properly be taken into account. We expect that, through that more explicit ability, managers will be more encouraged and will be careful to take account of opportunities before final decisions are reached.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI want to focus on the environmental wellbeing aspect, in particular. On the Crown Estate’s role in leasing the sea bed for activities, my interpretation is that it currently performs that duty with a view to generating income, but takes no account of the environmental impacts of, for example, salmon farming or offshore wind turbines. There has been contention about those on the east coast. How will that situation be different in the future? Will it be different at all?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe short answer to that is that we will have to wait to see how managers will use the new discretion. The existing decision making by managers of Crown Estate assets sits within the wider context of Government licensing of activities: a fair amount of environmental assessment already takes place before any activity can happen in the sea. A Crown Estate lease provides the ability for an actor to secure exclusive use of a space, but I think that, with the new duties, over time the spotlight will increasingly be placed on the environmental, social and wider economic consequences, rather than on the more narrow return that can be obtained from the lease by the Crown Estate.\n\n09:45\n\nThe Convener\n\nI welcome the addition of environmental wellbeing, but I am trying to understand what purpose it will serve and what difference it will make. At the moment, we rely on Marine Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and others to consider the environmental impacts of such activities. What specific duty would be placed on the Crown Estate?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nWe have to look at section 7 in the context of section 11, which is about transactions such as sales and leasing, which are market considerations that have, until now for the Crown Estate, focused on profit maximisation. Section 11 contains reforms that open the possibility of wider factors being taken into account. Section 7 can be viewed as showing that the Scottish ministers wish to see wider consideration of social, environmental and economic factors across the whole range of Crown Estate activity. Without section 7, transactions would rely only on section 11 rather than on the ethos of the organisation’s whole operation.\n\nThe Convener\n\nDo you envisage that the Crown Estate may in the future engage with other agencies to see whether there are environmental concerns—for example, before it enters in to an arrangement to allow a lease of sea bed?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nTo be fair to Crown Estate Scotland, I say that such discussion already happens. The decision making to which the convener referred is in the context of the national marine plan, which gives direction to all consenters, including Crown Estate Scotland or future managers of Crown Estate assets. Over and above that, it should provide even more explicit requirements for a manager to look up front at the extent to which such wider factors—not just the return to the Scottish Crown Estate—should play out.\n\nThe Convener\n\nMike Palmer may wish to come in on that point. How do you see that interaction?\n\nMike Palmer (Marine Scotland)\n\nThe extra duties and powers that will be placed on local managers are part of an overall balance that the Scottish ministers wish to develop in the management of the Scottish Crown estate. The ethos encourages greater and stronger local stewardship of assets and greater community empowerment. The Scottish ministers also wish to ensure that, alongside those, due consideration is given to the wider societal benefits that local managers should pursue and seek to achieve. The ethos that has been pursued by the Crown Estate Commissioners has been very commercial, up to now. The Scottish ministers seek to broaden that as part of a trade-off that includes local empowerment and letting some national management go to the local level.\n\nJohn Scott (Ayr) (Con)\n\nGood morning. If the machine that has, in essence, produced yield on assets moves to the new ethos, there will be a loss of focus on that objective. Do you expect the change in direction to reduce the yield on assets? If so, how much of a reduction do you expect, given the tightness of the Scottish budget?\n\nMike Palmer\n\nThe bill includes a primary duty to increase the value of the assets.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nHow will you measure value?\n\nMike Palmer\n\nThe bill refers to seeking to achieve “market value”—a clearly understood term that is defined in the commercial world, as a concept—except in certain circumstances, which are also defined in the bill. Local managers would have a primary duty to obtain market value and, thereby, to increase the value of the overall assets, so that focus is not being lost in any way. However, in the view of the Scottish ministers, a balance must be struck between that and social and environmental considerations, without sight being lost of either.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI want to pin you down on this. Do you expect the yield from the assets to reduce as a result of the new focus?\n\nMike Palmer\n\nOur expectation is that the yield from the Crown Estate’s overall assets will rise, which will also benefit Scotland. The Scottish ministers’ intentions are that, across all the elements—the economic, the environmental and the social spheres—benefit should accrue to Scotland from how Crown Estate assets in Scotland are managed. Ministers do not want to lose sight of that financial benefit, which goes alongside the other benefits: they expect the overall yield to be protected and for it to rise.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI presume that some of the overall yield will not go to the Scottish ministers, but to local authorities.\n\nMike Palmer\n\nThe commitment has been made that part of the yield from assets will go to local authorities.\n\nMark Ruskell (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Green)\n\nHow will the new objectives on environmental and social wellbeing change the relationship with the regulators? For example, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is undertaking a sectoral review of salmon farming and will introduce new regulations. My impression is that Crown Estate Scotland has been only loosely involved in that process. Do you see a different, perhaps tighter, relationship developing with the regulator?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI have lots of discussions with Crown Estate Scotland and with regulators. My sense is that a lot of dialogue takes place. A partnership approach is taken by the public sector in Scotland to many activities. New discussions might take place around the margins, but I think that the relationships already exist.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nMy point is that we have not seen Crown Estate Scotland embedded in some processes—in particular, those on regulatory reform. Do you expect that to change? Is Crown Estate Scotland’s current level of engagement—with, for example, SEPA, on salmon farming—adequate, or do you expect that engagement will increase as a result of the new objectives?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nAs I have said, Crown Estate Scotland is already involved in a lot of initiatives. Engagement could increase. People understand that Crown Estate Scotland is an interim manager, so they might be involved directly in discussions.\n\nThe change that we can anticipate through implementation of the bill is that there would be more managers and that more one-to-one discussions could be had with the regulators. As Mike Palmer said, there is a wish to balance local discretion with a national framework. We see the strategic plan as a means by which strategic intentions can be outlined, and by which regulators can efficiently have that dialogue with managers of Crown Estate assets in Scotland. Over and above that, there may be specific initiatives in which managers could get involved.\n\nWe have to wait and see. It is difficult: there is no blueprint of what the future will look like because there is not yet full knowledge about local ambitions for management of Crown Estate assets. Everyone would like to see managers of Scottish Crown Estate assets being involved in those types of discussions. We are starting from a good foundation; the question is how much more will be needed as the changes play out.\n\nAlex Rowley (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab)\n\nA point was made about the new discretion in relation to social good and environmental good. Where will the final decisions on social good and environmental good be made? The convener gave the example of salmon farming. If Shetland Islands Council, for example, has control over waters, and decides on environmental grounds not to accept an application for a salmon farm, will that be the final decision or could the operator lobby the Scottish ministers? Where will the power lie? Will it be devolved to local managers or will there be a process by which their decisions could be overruled?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe power will lie with the managers of assets, who must have regard to the duty and can use discretion. They will have to be able to defend their decisions. The decisions will not be taken in isolation, but will sit within the wider context of Scotland’s regulatory framework, including the framework that governs the environmental context for decision making—the national marine plan, in the example that Alex Rowley used. There will also be the strategic plan, which is provided for in the bill, for the wider and longer-term approach to management of assets. That should set the context for managers, who must have regard to the strategic plan. There will be local discretion—but within a decision-making context that is provided for in the wider regulatory framework, and in policies and legislation other than the bill.\n\nMike Palmer\n\nOn where power will lie, the bill is drafted in such a way as to give ministers the discretion to decide case by case whether a transfer should be made to a local manager. There will be a very careful process of consultation and scrutiny of people’s proposals on how they wish to manage an asset. That process will be undertaken before any decision to transfer to a local manager. There will be checks and balances to ensure that, case by case, considered decisions are taken by the Scottish ministers before a transfer.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI want to go back to Mike Palmer’s answer to John Scott about what is envisaged in terms of income generation. In the financial memorandum, there is speculation on the range of possible financial costs to the Scottish Government. It suggests that there is potential—I stress “potential”—for a drop in income from local authority ports and from non-operational ports and jetties. It speculates that the range would be “zero to medium”, which over a five-year period could be anywhere between £2 million and £10 million. There appears to be anticipation of the possibility of a drop in revenue from one aspect of current income. Given that, do you still hold to the view that, overall, there will be an increase in income?\n\n10:00\n\nMike Palmer\n\nI think that the Scottish ministers envisage that there is a substantial opportunity for the overall value of the estate to rise. Some elements of the estate might not be expected to return as much in the short or medium terms as other elements, but there are other opportunities—offshore in the marine environment, for example—about which it is felt that the likelihood is quite high that revenues from the estate will increase quite significantly. Clearly we cannot guarantee that or know exactly what will pan out in the future, but those are the current indications.\n\nThe Convener\n\nOne obvious opportunity is offshore wind, but that depends on the United Kingdom Government’s attitude to financial support. John Scott wants to come in.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI am intrigued by the concept that income will fall in some areas and that, as a result, other areas will have to work harder and provide more income. Would you care to be more specific about that? Are we talking about rents from properties—farm rents, or whatever? In which areas is income expected to rise, given that income from other areas is expected to fall?\n\nMike Palmer\n\nI will defer to David Mallon on the detail—\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI think that you should answer the question, given that you made the statement.\n\nMike Palmer\n\nI guess that it is almost a statement of fact that some assets might in any one year be expected to deliver more revenue than others. It is not possible to predict that with total accuracy from one year to the next, and it is often dependent on the wider economic context within which one is managing the estate.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nForgive me for asking such a blunt question, but do you have a business plan for developing the project?\n\nMike Palmer\n\nYes. The current national manager, Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management), has a business plan and a forward strategy for managing the estate. Clearly, as we move towards the legislation and into a period when there will be the potential to transfer down to a local level, the overall dynamic of the management of the assets will change, and we will be looking at individual business plans and strategies drawn up by local managers. At the moment, however, a national planning regime is in place.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI think that Mike Palmer was looking at both dimensions: first, the more narrow return to the Crown Estate Scotland from a transaction; and, secondly, what might be called a national accounting framework. As far as a manager’s duties are concerned, the default would be a commercial approach unless they could demonstrate that it was expected that wider benefits would accrue. Where those benefits would accrue, it would be tolerable in a national sense to experience a reduction in that income. Even though the fiscal framework and accounting might result in an overall reduction to the Scottish block, the reduction in the revenue or capital obtained would be expected to be accompanied by wider benefits accruing to Scotland as a whole. As a whole, therefore, the position should be neutral, at least, or favourable.\n\nI should also add that the scenarios contained in the financial memorandum range from no change—which could be how managers choose to run and manage the assets—to a maximum position of no charge and zero revenue equivalent to what is obtained at present.\n\nThe truth probably lies somewhere in between, but until managers have the ability to follow their own local priorities, in that national context, precise changes in the existing income level will be quite difficult to predict.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nHave projections been made, or not?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThrough our work on the business and regulatory impact assessment for the consultation paper and, building on that, through the financial memorandum, we have looked at the potential consequences over the next five years and at the various scenarios. Underlying that are some assumptions and quite a lot of work that we have done with our finance colleagues, our economists and stakeholders.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThe Convener\n\nDonald Cameron has a question.\n\nDonald Cameron (Highlands and Islands) (Con)\n\nI refer the committee to my entry in the register of members’ interests, in that I am a landowner.\n\nI want to be clear about this. When we talk about management of an asset, to what extent does revenue accrue to the manager and to what extent does it remain with the Crown Estate?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI will try to cover that point, although I ask my fellow witnesses to add to my comments if I miss anything. The manager is responsible for the management of that asset and will receive the gross revenue that is generated from it. The costs associated with management of the asset will be paid from that gross revenue by the manager. If there is a surplus at the end of the year, it is required to be paid into the Scottish consolidated fund.\n\nDonald Cameron\n\nLet me give a hypothetical situation of a wind farm on one of the Crown Estate’s estates and perhaps both the local community council and the local authority want to be the manager, and a significant net income is involved. How would that situation be resolved? Does the bill put in place a framework for the resolution of such disputes?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but I think that the dispute that you mention relates to who should be the manager—the community or the local authority. In such a situation it is not impossible to foresee some difference of opinion. The Scottish ministers hope that, through following due process for the implementation of the bill, such issues might be resolved at an early stage. As part of the implementation plan, rather than just awaiting ad hoc proposals from individual organisations, the Scottish ministers are contemplating the value of a phased approach and a process that might involve seeking views from communities and local authorities over and above those that, to date, have expressed views on their ambitions to manage assets. A considered view might then be taken as to who, in any one circumstance, is best placed to take on management responsibility. Once that issue is decided, there will be duties that will apply to managers, relating to, for example, the production of a management plan to outline intentions on how assets will be managed, proposed sales and so on. At a practical level, I expect a manager to receive a lot of contributions on what should be in the plan, so that there is, at a second level, the ability to manage potential differences in opinion among parties.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThank you. Let us move on. Kate Forbes has a question.\n\nKate Forbes (Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch) (SNP)\n\nI will continue with the theme of revenue generation. In 2015, the First Minister stated that coastal and island communities\n\n“will benefit from 100 per cent of the net revenue generated in their area from activities within 12 miles of the shore”.\n\nYou may have touched on this earlier, but what is the current thinking on arrangements for distribution to coastal and island councils of net revenue from marine assets out to 12 nautical miles?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nWe are in discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities about the mechanics of implementing that commitment. The starting point is that, as we speak, and although the devolution of the management has been secured, we do not yet have a set of audited accounts for Scotland, let alone for the assets at a more local level. That set of accounts will be available only at the end of this financial year. Once it is produced and finalised by Crown Estate Scotland and audited by the Auditor General, that will provide the reference point for what the net revenue is. In our discussions with COSLA, we have been looking at a way in which there can be an allocation to individual local authorities based on that amount, probably on an interim basis, given that that will be the first set of accounts.\n\nKate Forbes\n\nPresumably, based on your earlier answer to Donald Cameron, that revenue would go directly to coastal and island councils only if the local authority was the manager.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nNot in the initial phase, because Crown Estate Scotland has been the manager for the past year. In a broader sense, that commitment recognised the point that has been made that some benefit should accrue from the presence of those activities taking place on assets adjacent to the population concerned. Ministers have so far sought to draw a distinction between management and revenue, so that we do not have to wait until the question of management is settled before local communities can benefit from the revenue that has been generated.\n\nKate Forbes\n\nIs it the case that, irrespective of who is the manager, coastal councils will benefit from 100 per cent of the net revenue?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nYes, in a sense, but I would like to rephrase that slightly, if that is all right. Irrespective of who is the manager, we want coastal communities to benefit, and the interim arrangements would go through the local authorities. As management changes and we perhaps have a mix of community organisations and local authorities, the unanswered question is whether it is correct that local authorities should be the only beneficiaries of that income as the whole system develops, or whether there is a need to reappraise the way in which the money ultimately reaches a community.\n\nKate Forbes\n\nWhere there are councils—Highland Council, for example—that have some islands but a lot of area that is landlocked, would the net revenue go directly to the council, and would there be any stipulation that it is to return to communities that are actually on the coast?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nAnother strand to the dialogue with COSLA concerns the extent to which it will be an allocation without any description of what its purpose is, or whether there will be some guidance on how it should be used. Sometimes there is ring fencing around local authority funding. It is unlikely that ring fencing will be the favoured option, but dialogue is happening and there may be some communication by ministers when the award is given as to the overall purpose of that money. Those discussions have not yet concluded.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nWhat motivation will there be for organisations to become managers, given that 91 per cent of the revenue will go to the Scottish consolidated fund, although there will obviously be different arrangements for local authorities? To pick up on Donald Cameron’s example of a community wanting to become the manager of a wind farm, there would be some profit there, but most of the revenue profit would go elsewhere. How will the arrangements that you are setting out in the bill affect that motivation, when managers are not able to invest their full profits back into the assets?\n\n10:15\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe finances are an interesting and complex set of issues to work through. You are referring to the 9 per cent that the existing manager can at present retain for reinvestment in the estate. Even if the figure remains at 9 per cent—with the ability to vary that in future—although 91 per cent will go into the Scottish consolidated fund, as is the case for Crown Estate Scotland, that amount for reinvestment would not be an insignificant sum for a local community that was managing an asset that is perhaps underutilised at present. Although there is a focus on national management, a community might have ideas on how a local asset could be managed differently but might not have the ability to do that. Even 9 per cent could be a game changer if it is directed at that specific activity rather than across the estate.\n\nOver and above that, in my dialogue with stakeholders and in the stakeholder advisory group, which is convened by the cabinet secretary, and through the consultation responses, the theme of local control has been, I would say, stronger than that of revenue. Also, as I just said in relation to the question on revenue, there is potentially the ability to go beyond the 9 per cent that can be retained before money is paid into the Scottish consolidated fund, through decision making on what happens once the money reaches the consolidated fund. As a starting point, the issue is as much about control as it is about the revenue that can be generated. However, the revenue may not be insignificant, even at 9 per cent, although it could be more.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nI hear that but, in managing a wind farm, for example, there is a huge amount of sweat equity involved. How was that 9 per cent figure arrived at?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThat is a carryover and a continuation of the long-standing arrangements that the Crown Estate Commissioners agreed with the Treasury. Through discussion with Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management), that was thought to be the appropriate requirement moving forward. The bill will enable that 9 per cent to be varied, primarily depending on need for reinvestment, such as capital investment, in the estate.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nSo it is an historical figure.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nYes.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nIt does not reflect the new arrangements, in which there will be a more diverse base of managers.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThat is correct, but the bill provides the ability to take account of the requirements of an individual manager.\n\nFinlay Carson (Galloway and West Dumfries) (Con)\n\nMy primary question about the 9 per cent figure has been answered. There is potential for multiple managers to be identified across Scotland. We have a lot of coastal councils. What process will there be for deciding who the most appropriate manager is? Even in my constituency of Galloway and West Dumfries, we could have the local authority as well as multiple community organisations wanting to take over harbours or have a share in the community benefit that could be derived from managing wind turbines in their patch. How will that process play out? Will there be a bidding process?\n\nHow will you address the potential for conflicts of interest, given that local authorities will potentially take 100 per cent of the income generated but will also be the planning authority or the authority that looks after environmental health?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nTo take the last point first, in other settings, local authorities have to manage those conflicts of interest, and they have experience of putting in place systems that are designed to avoid such conflicts coming into play.\n\nOn how a manager will be decided, as I said, one option would be for the Scottish ministers just to await proposals or requests from individual parties, with the expectation that there could be a variety of proposals for the same asset. Another option, as I mentioned earlier, is for ministers to attach a process to that.\n\nThe Scottish ministers’ view is that, whoever becomes a manager, it would have to be as a result of an inclusive process, in which the existing manager and others who will be doing business with the new manager are involved and consulted, and come to a view on an appropriate arrangement. As I said, ministers are contemplating having a process whereby parties can make a request, which would have to demonstrate that a proposal is of benefit and that the required capability exists. In the consultation that the Scottish ministers conducted last year, I think that 86 per cent of respondents to the question said that councils or community organisations should demonstrate their capability.\n\nProposals that come forward will need to be looked at carefully to ensure that the arrangements are appropriate. Even if the council or community organisation has a good stake, good knowledge and, in principle, a good reason to take on management of an asset, there is a need for a smooth transition through any change and for a service to continue to be delivered to tenants, industry bodies and companies that depend on that service.\n\nFinlay Carson\n\nAt the moment, it could be said that the Crown Estate wind farms are all managed by one or two people; there is one person who looks after the coastal areas. Following this bill, there could be multiple managers. Would the income generated by the whole of Scotland be reduced because there would be far more management involved than there is at the moment?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI will try to answer the different strands to that question. There will need to be a final decision on whether it is appropriate to devolve that particular activity further. Even if it is—which is a fairly open question, as no final decision has been taken—and there is more than one manager, the bill provides for a strategic plan for the management of the assets, and therefore a strategic overview. There is also the national marine plan.\n\nAs outlined in the financial memorandum, there is the possibility that there could be increased costs associated with administration. However, there could be increased opportunities such as new revenue from a manager managing assets commercially that have not been managed commercially before. There is the possibility of increased costs—primarily one-off changes—such as some additional administration costs and some additional transaction costs for operators in the industry that have to deal with more than the one or two people whom they deal with at present. We hope that those transaction costs would be reduced based on the ability of the industry to engage primarily at the strategic-plan level.\n\nFinlay Carson\n\nDo you foresee a situation in which, if the income generated is not greater, one manager would be retained for all the wind farm interests that the Crown Estate has at the moment, and that management of wind farms would not be devolved to local authorities or community group organisations?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nIt is not possible to rule out that ministers might have concerns about the costs involved. There might be other ways in which the end could be achieved, such as some form of local decision making through support, administration or involvement by the local community. Ministers want the bill to make it possible to change who manages the assets at present, through the two processes that exist. The Smith commission recommended that further devolution opportunities should be considered. Ministers want the bill to enable that process to happen, but also for the bill to be a tailored approach to local circumstances, which takes account of the wider asset base as well.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nForgive me for this question; I probably have not read enough on the subject. If 100 per cent of the net income from fish farming or wind farms is to be given to local authorities or community bodies, will the same amount be deducted from councils’ overall annual budget settlements from the Scottish Government, or will those net incomes be in addition to councils’ annual settlements? That might be a binary question; forgive me for not knowing the answer.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nAt present, the intention is not to deduct an equivalent amount from general local government budgets, but I think that we will have to—\n\nJohn Scott\n\nIt will be in addition, then.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nIt will be in addition. That is the current proposal, but no final decision has been made.\n\nThe Convener\n\nDoes not that potentially create a conflict of interest for a local authority when it comes to make a decision about consent for, say, a salmon farm? The local authority must weigh up the environmental impacts, for example, but its decision could generate income for it.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI see the link as quite indirect, given the mechanics of the Scotland Act 2016, which requires the revenue to be paid into the Scottish consolidated fund. The discussions about how allocations are made to local authorities will probably, in the absence of our being able to pinpoint how much each asset is making, naturally mean—although the system is not designed in this way—that the decision on a particular asset for a particular purpose will be a few steps removed from the issue of how much is received at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe Convener\n\nMy point is about the principle.\n\nMike Palmer\n\nIf I might refer to something that David Mallon said earlier, we are conscious that local authorities already have to make a wide range of decisions that potentially draw them into conflicts of interest. Local authorities have rigorous governance arrangements in place to ensure that there are checks and balances in the internal systems that they run, so that their decisions are proper, objective and not unduly coloured by conflicts of interest. We expect the local governance arrangements in local authorities to be rigorous enough to enable authorities to make the decisions that we are talking about.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI am not suggesting that local authorities would necessarily act in a certain way. However, they could be open to allegations about conflict of interest from people who oppose projects. I am thinking about how we safeguard local authorities from allegations or accusations in that regard.\n\nMike Palmer\n\nIndeed. I think that the Scottish ministers recognise that. It is worth repeating David Mallon’s point about the indirect way in which the money will flow and the methodology that we envisage using for redistributing the money—we do not envisage it being tied to individual income that is received from, say, a fish farm. I think that that will create sufficient distance to reassure detractors that there is no perceived conflict of interest.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWe will explore the issue more as we go through the evidence-gathering process.\n\nAlex Rowley\n\nWe have mentioned the potential for increased administration costs. In relation to the proposed reporting arrangements, the bill provides for the setting up of a new Scottish public body and for mechanisms such as the preparation of a strategic plan, which will be laid before the Parliament, and the preparation—by managers of assets—of annual reports and management plans, which will also be laid before the Parliament. The bill also provides for a framework to transfer and delegate management to a number of different types of manager.\n\nWith all that, is there not potential for establishing what could become a complex set of management arrangements? In terms of the reporting requirements for ministers, Crown Estate Scotland and asset managers, is there a balance between the level of bureaucracy and the ability to innovate with new ideas and developments? After all, what is this all about and what change will it bring? I assume that that ability is behind the thinking for making the devolution changes, so is there a balance between allowing local managers to innovate and keeping control of the estate as a whole?\n\n10:30\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThere is, very much so. There is a balance to be struck between local discretion and accountability, and, along with accountability, consistency around Scotland where there is value in having consistency. The bill’s provisions seek to ensure that there is a balanced approach.\n\nWhen it comes to the costs, ministers view it necessary that a set of accounts is produced for transparency and accountability purposes. That is also because the assets remain under the ownership of the Crown, and decisions on how to obtain revenue from the assets could potentially have an impact on the overall Scottish block. From those perspectives, it was thought important to have that accounting framework. On the cost, Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) is required at present to produce accounts and a plan, and we see the cost as being broadly equivalent to that.\n\nThere is the possibility of some increased costs as a result of the change in management process. Ministers have overseen the process by which the new interim body was established; it involved the establishment of a new set of systems, staff transfers and so on, and that experience will assist when it comes to making further change in a way that is sensitive and takes account of staff welfare.\n\nWe are probably in a different scenario from that recent change, in that the way in which the devolution was done resulted in the need for the Scottish ministers, Crown Estate Scotland and Crown Estate Commissioners to establish brand new systems, because there was no willingness for shared services on a wider United Kingdom basis. Those systems were created and they have been designed to run the assets in Scotland. Therefore, further change at an operational level could be expected to require adaptation of the systems rather than brand new systems or, in the case of, say, a local authority, the adaptation of its own system. The costs are likely to be significantly lower than the initial costs of setting up Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management).\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI want to discuss the difference between the transfer of powers under section 3 and the delegation of powers under sections 4 and 5. What is the rationale for the two different means of devolving management powers?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nMinisters’ basic approach is to have more than one tool in the toolbox—it is horses for courses. The transfer process would result in a permanent change, whereas the delegation process is required to have a timescale that could be quite long term, although there is the ability to complete the process on a shorter-term basis.\n\nMore fundamentally, the result of a transfer would be the end of Crown Estate Scotland’s involvement in the direct management of the asset whereas, with a delegation, there would still be a relationship between Crown Estate Scotland and the new manager. We view the second result, in which there is the ability to have that relationship, as potentially more attractive to some local managers. It could involve Crown Estate Scotland providing such things as staff support, other infrastructure or guidance. The main on-the-ground difference between the two processes for further devolution is that delegation would enable Crown Estate Scotland to be one step removed from direct involvement.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nThank you. Can you give me examples of circumstances in which you might expect each process to be used? What happens if a transfer goes wrong, such as if a body ceases to exist—if, having had assets transferred to it, it goes bankrupt, for example? What would be the fall-back position in those circumstances?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe provisions in the bill make it possible for a community organisation to take on the management of one or more assets on an area basis or a community-of-interest basis. Because of that possibility, the bill could lead to one of the few instances of a non-public organisation managing a public asset. The fact is that it is, unfortunately, more likely that a private company or a community organisation in the third sector will cease to exist. Therefore, the bill’s provisions not only enable a transfer to community organisations but allow for the arrangements that should apply on an organisation’s ceasing to exist to be specified in the transfer order.\n\nFor a delegation to that type of organisation to be made, ministers would first direct the existing manager to delegate the management. There would then be a requirement for the existing manager and the future delegate to strike a delegation agreement. There would be the ability through that delegation agreement to specify what would happen should the organisation that is taking on the delegated management cease to exist, including what should happen to the management of the asset in the future.\n\nAlso—importantly in the case of delegation—until that unfortunate scenario occurred, Crown Estate Scotland would be involved in some way, shape or form. Therefore, it would be able to readily take on again the direct management of the delegated asset.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI am more interested in the transfer than in the delegation. I presume that the transfer is an arm’s-length agreement and that, once an asset is transferred to another body—whatever that body is—it is gone. What happens then?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nIn the bill, there are provisions that enable the specification of what will happen once the organisation ceases to exist. Over and above that, there is the ability, in theory, for another transfer to another body to take place through another Scottish statutory instrument.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI would like to clarify something. I would guess that it is just part of a belt-and-braces approach to cover any eventuality, but for both transfer and delegation there is a reference in the bill to\n\n“another Scottish public authority”,\n\nmeaning something other than a local authority. If I am right in interpreting that as belt and braces, that is fine. If not, do you have any thoughts on what other Scottish public authorities might take on the management of assets?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nI hasten to add that the Scottish ministers currently have no plans for that. However, ministers consulted last year on a long-term framework for the management of Crown Estate assets. When formulating the bill proposals, we wanted to think beyond the first phase of any transfers or delegations and to consider what might be appropriate in the future as far as the landscape for delivery is concerned.\n\nIt is difficult to say where such possibilities might emerge. However, what you suggest is probably more readily a good proposition where there is alignment between an organisation’s existing functions and the area of activity or the economic sector in which the manager of a Crown Estate asset is currently involved. One way of looking at it, therefore, is as providing the potential for greater alignment between the functions of existing bodies and the related leasing function that Crown Estate Scotland operates.\n\nThe Convener\n\nJohn Scott has another question to ask before I bring in Mark Ruskell.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nThis will be my final question, convener. What are the opportunities for public and parliamentary scrutiny of decisions to transfer or delegate powers?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe transfer of powers would happen through a Scottish statutory instrument, which would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Obviously such an order would be published and agreed thereafter.\n\nDelegation would take place through a direction to the existing manager, which would be published. The bill does not require the delegation agreement to be published, because the detail is likely to include commercially sensitive information or other information that it would not be appropriate to publish. However, over and above the requirements of the bill’s provisions, ministers’ policy is to have transparency, openness and accountability, and the content of the delegation agreement could therefore be published in some way, shape or form.\n\nI should also point out that, for any transfer, ministers will be required by the bill to consult the existing manager, the future manager and anyone else whom they consider appropriate. Moreover, any delegation will require the agreement of the delegate.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nYou have said that a transfer will happen through an SSI. Given that the transfer of some assets might be quite significant, will such an instrument be subject to affirmative or negative procedure?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe proposal is for any transfer order that seeks to amend primary legislation to be subject to affirmative procedure; if that is not the case, it will be subject to negative procedure.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nHowever, in the interests of the openness and transparency that you have already referred to, would it not be better in most cases for the instrument to be affirmative?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe provisions in the bill sit alongside what is likely to be a lot of dialogue that will take place prior to the laying of an order, including discussions with the existing manager, the proposed new manager and other interests. I envisage a lot of that activity taking place before ministers are satisfied that the order is ready to be laid.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI see. Thank you.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nWhy does the bill not contain an automatic presumption that local authorities will be the managers of the foreshore and sea bed?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nMinisters have taken a view that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate for such a diverse range of assets. The consultation outlined three options: first, the traditional do-nothing scenario, in which everything would still be managed at the national level; secondly, the devolution of all assets to a local level, either to local authorities or to community organisations; and, thirdly, a case-by-case consideration of the appropriate level for managing individual assets. Although there was no overriding expression of support for any one of those options, the most favoured option was the case-by-case approach. Because of the complexity and variety of assets and the different views that exist on the matter, ministers have carried that approach into their proposals, to enable more than one outcome.\n\nIn addition, so far, not all local authorities have said that they want to take on the management of the assets. Ministers did not want to impose the change, especially as some of the assets may have significant liabilities. At present, we do not have a full set of accounts for the entire estate, let alone for individual assets. Only at the end of this year will we have a year of accounts for the Scottish assets.\n\n10:45\n\nMike Palmer\n\nWe are also aware that, in some areas where local authorities have expressed an interest in taking over management, community organisations have also expressed an interest. It is important to take into account that, as well as local authorities, other types of organisations are interested in taking over management. That is another reason for making decisions on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIt may be worth making the committee aware that arrangements are being developed to pilot local management of assets so that we can test-bed the process of transferring management to a local level. Those arrangements are being developed by Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management).\n\nAngus MacDonald (Falkirk East) (SNP)\n\nPicking up on that point, can you tell the committee what progress there has been on the development of pilot schemes for the devolution of assets to the island authorities? Can you give an indication of the timing of that and of any support that may be required by the local authorities?\n\nI refer members to my interests in non-domestic property in the Outer Hebrides.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nCrown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) was requested by the Scottish ministers to continue dialogue with the islands councils about the proposal for pilots of local management in the island areas. Those discussions have continued between Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) and the local authorities.\n\nAnother strand of thinking that Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) has been developing involves the possibility of pilots in other areas. The board of Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) has been considering how best to take forward the issue of pilots. It is finalising its thinking and is in dialogue with COSLA and the islands councils about making an announcement on the best way forward in the near future.\n\nDonald Cameron\n\n“In the near future” is an interesting phrase. Discussions that I had with one islands authority indicated that it is very keen to pilot a scheme. I hope you understand that there is not impatience but enthusiasm for pilot schemes and know that the island authorities want to start as quickly as possible.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nAnother sign of Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management)’s serious intent to take forward pilot proposals is that, in the autumn, it appointed an independent contractor to develop advice and a programme of work for how it could do that.\n\nI know that “in the near future” is not as specific a timetable as you would like, but it is important that Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) makes the announcement, and I do not think that it will be too long in coming.\n\nStewart Stevenson (Banffshire and Buchan Coast) (SNP)\n\nI have a brief point about the definition of “community organisation” that is used in the bill. First, and most obviously, why is it different from the definition of community bodies that appears to fit in other legislation? Why have a different definition?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nWhat is being contemplated here is different from what is in other legislation, but the bill is modelled on existing legislation in terms of the characteristics and criteria. The value of not exactly mirroring what is in other legislation is that this situation is different and ministers think that it is very important to make it possible for community organisations to take on the management of assets. A third sector community organisation would need to consider carefully whether its constitution and so on will tolerate it becoming the manager of an asset on behalf of the Crown. Other legislation mentions specifically Scottish charitable incorporated organisations or community benefit societies, and the judgment was made that such mentions could imply that it would be automatically possible for any such organisation to take on management. In fact, very careful case-by-case consideration will be required.\n\nStewart Stevenson\n\nExisting community bodies take ownership, in essence, of assets on a permanent basis, such as Machrihanish airbase. Such a situation is clearly different from being a manager of someone else’s asset. Some bodies are hybrid and own assets as well as managing other people’s assets—I think that Stòras Uibhist is one example. Have you looked at the crossover between existing models and reached any conclusions on what works well and, perhaps in some cases, less well? Community bodies, in particular, have sometimes had local issues to do with definitions of geography. For example, the Ulva buyout depended on the consent of people on the mainland, because the definition is based on postcodes. Have you learned from those difficulties and deliberately come up with different things because of that knowledge?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nWe have certainly learned from wider experience. The proposed definitions are the product of substantial discussion with policy leads in community empowerment and land reform about what is appropriate for this setting. The conclusions that have been reached so far are about a complex area: Stòras Uibhist has a mix of functions; some charitable and community organisations are a mix of a SCIO and a community benefit society, while some organisations are one or the other; the provisions also make it possible for a private organisation to take on management. The two types of charitable organisation will need to think through the complexities carefully in the context of the asset that they are interested in taking on and the way in which the management would operate, so that they can best ensure that what they want to see happen will not risk their status or existence.\n\nStewart Stevenson\n\nMy final question is about mainly the risks and maybe the opportunities. A community organisation would be a manager on behalf of the Crown Estate. If the community organisation fails, would its liabilities stay in the organisation or would they pass back to the Crown Estate?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThe transfer or delegation would be implemented in such a way as to ensure that the asset would come back to the Crown Estate.\n\nStewart Stevenson\n\nMy question was broader. It is clear that the asset that the community body had managed would remain with the Crown Estate. If, for example, the community body concluded that the best way to discharge its responsibilities would be to enter into a contract to manage some aspects of its responsibilities with a third party that then failed, I can see liabilities being created that would have to either stay with the now-failed community organisation or pass back to the Crown Estate. Are we clear about the legal issues that might cause an organisation to fail and who would end up with the liabilities in that category?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nA substantial amount of thinking has been done on liabilities. The transfer order or the delegation agreement would make provision for the management of liabilities and a requirement for the manager to keep separate accounts for the management of the Crown asset and the management of any other activities. Therefore, it should be possible to discern the liabilities associated with the management of the Crown asset, which will be helpful to an extent in the scenario that you have painted. However, I do not think that that will be an easy scenario to work through; it never is.\n\nThere is also the question of what a liability is. Largely speaking, it is a cost. It could be an historical cost or a future cost.\n\nThinking through all those aspects has taken up a substantial amount of time to date, and they will have to be properly reflected in the mechanism or vehicle for effecting a transfer so that we can minimise the negative scenarios.\n\nStewart Stevenson\n\nI am hearing that the community organisation would be allowed to take on a contingent liability or a liability that could pass to the Crown Estate only if the Crown Estate had given permission in the first instance for that possibility to exist.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nIn practice, that is probably right. It is difficult to make a general statement about such a complex area, but there is an expectation. I go back to the prior question about what the benefit to a community organisation from managing an asset is. I think that it is encapsulated by the idea of having control and some financial benefit for reinvestment in the estate to benefit the community. However, if that is the extent of the benefit, ministers are keen to be careful not to overburden the manager with liabilities that would sit with it if it no longer existed. It is all managed as a Crown asset, so it is about how we can recognise what a Crown liability is and ensure that it is treated separately, as it should be, from the manager’s other activities.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI want to raise an issue before we come to Richard Lyle’s final question. There is considerable experience in the Crown Estate of creating local management agreements. How much of an asset will that be in coming to arrangements? The experience among staff of guiding organisations and determining the appropriateness of arrangements might help us to avoid the scenarios that Mr Stevenson has identified.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nA lot of experience exists, and I think that the intention is to ensure that that experience is not lost and that it can be accessed and used to think through those issues.\n\nRichard Lyle (Uddingston and Bellshill) (SNP)\n\nGood morning. At stage 2 of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Bill recently, I was successful with amendments to remove sections 18 to 20 of that bill, which might have caused confusion and additional complexity for groups that seek to get involved in land management. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Connectivity agreed with those proposals and supported them. What help will you give to groups to realise their potential and their ideas? I want groups to get access and to be part of the new idea. What will you give them? Will you pay for start-up costs or allow them to access revenue streams immediately if they come up with ideas that you guys or girls support?\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nThere are three ways in which that capacity can be built, the first of which involves looking to increase awareness and knowledge of what the assets are and how they are managed so that there is an understanding of what is involved, what could potentially be taken on and whether, in the group’s view, it is appropriate for it to seek to take an asset on.\n\nSecondly, we will I hope benefit from experience as pilot proposals are developed and begin to be implemented. The experience on the ground of running the pilots will help in considering the future use of the powers for ministers in the bill, not only in the pilot areas but potentially in other areas.\n\nThirdly, the bill includes powers for ministers or Crown Estate Scotland to provide support costs for the transition of an organisation to being a manager or for that matter a delegate.\n\n11:00\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nSo I am right in thinking that you will empower groups and will be prepared to look at any legal proposals that will increase assets or encourage community groups in local areas.\n\nDavid Mallon\n\nYes. Any reasonable request will need to be properly assessed and a decision will have to be taken. The Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform has made it clear that she is interested in community organisations that wish to take on management of one or more of the assets. We are in discussion with Community Land Scotland and other organisations about how we can disseminate information on what the bill enables and how organisations can express an interest. The pilots and, I hope, the parliamentary scrutiny process will be important in raising the profile of this set of issues.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThank you, gentlemen. This has been a useful scene setter for the work that we are about to undertake.\n\nAt the committee’s next meeting, on 27 February, we will take evidence from Paul Wheelhouse on the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2017 (SSI 2017/451). We will also consider our draft report to the Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee on our inquiry into the environmental impacts of salmon farming and consider our approach to future work on the marine environment.\n\nAs agreed earlier, we will now move into private session. I ask for the public gallery to be cleared, as the public part of the meeting is now concluded.\n\n11:02 Meeting continued in private until 12:56.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWelcome back. The third item on the agenda is to take evidence on the Scottish Crown Estate Bill at stage 1, with a particular focus on the agricultural assets of Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management). I welcome Gemma Cooper from the National Farmers Union Scotland, Tom Cattanach from Fochabers estate, Hew Hunter from Whitehills estate, Jim Inness from Glenlivet estate and Brian Shaw from Applegirth estate.\n\nWe are already well behind schedule, so I ask members to ask short, sharp questions. If witnesses do not feel the need to respond to a particular question and feel that it has been well enough answered, they do not need to respond. If we proceed on that basis, we will get through this meeting in an appropriate fashion.\n\nI will start with an obvious question. From the evidence that we have had, it strikes me that, although there will always be individual issues, in a general sense there is a degree of contentment with the Crown estate, and with Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management), in terms of its relationship with tenant farming set-ups. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nBrian Shaw (Applegirth Estate)\n\nYes. We have come from a position, with the old Crown Estate, where we did not have any communication or say at all. Now we have established a working group and we are getting on very well with Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management). We like it. There are issues, of course.\n\nThe Convener\n\nAs ever. Jim Inness, do you wish to concur with that?\n\nJim Inness (Glenlivet Estate)\n\nI agree with it. We represent the Crown Estate’s four estates in Scotland—Applegirth, Whitehills, Glenlivet and Fochabers. We are the community of farmers. Our working group has come on by leaps and bounds, and we would like it to be advantageous for both sides, going forward.\n\nClaudia Beamish\n\nGood morning, panel. Can I tease out some of the opportunities that are presented by the rural estate? Some of us visited tenanted farms and areas in the previous parliamentary session. We saw interesting models of things such as best practice in managing tenants and encouraging young farmers and young entrants, which is very important. We also saw interesting examples of innovation and management of the environmental wellbeing of the land. Do you see there being any other positive and possible opportunities?\n\nGemma Cooper (National Farmers Union Scotland)\n\nI can answer that. The Crown Estate provides a unique opportunity for best practice in that, although it is mainly composed of secure agricultural tenants, there will be pieces of land that come back to it. It would be very positive if it had policies that were more in favour of getting young entrants into farming, perhaps by providing something akin to the starter farm units that the Forestry Commission offers. I think that the Crown Estate has a unique role to play in that and it is a really important opportunity, because at the moment, generally, opportunities are very limited.\n\n10:45\n\nJim Inness\n\nI would say that we are quite fortunate to be on the Crown estate. Its management would like to see the wellbeing of the estate and the tenants within it, which is a healthy approach. Other landlords may be less scrupulous and less accommodating, so we have an opportunity to show best practice to the other landlords out there.\n\nThere is a possible case for a subsidised rent for new entrants to farming, to give them a start. It is in our submission. On the wider issue of rent reviews and sustainability for farmers in the tenanted sector, due account has to be taken of the social infrastructure of where you farm. It is not all about revenue. We have to keep the fabric of these communities intact. If we keep the community intact and the farming intact, the whole thing looks after itself. It is not all about revenue all the time. We have to be careful of how we manage rent reviews going forward.\n\nThe Convener\n\nOne of the things that I have picked up in dealings with the tenant farmers on the Crown estate is a possible concern about the factoring arrangements. There is not an embedded factor on an estate or even an embedded factor for the whole of the Crown estate that tenants can go to. Very often, it is a local land agent or a locally based land agent, who is available for one or two days a week. Does this bill present an opportunity to change that approach and would you welcome such a change?\n\nHew Hunter (Whitehills Estate)\n\nWe have asked a number of times—would Bell’s Brae have its own factor? The response was always that the Crown Estate relied on Savills to give it more experience and more staff. I think that we would be quite keen to have an in-house factor.\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nWe have a junior factor who comes round but he only works two days a week. There is a problem with tenants not being able to converse well. We are only just picking up on emails, but if you want something done, you have to do the paperwork and get it logged. The general tenant will meet up with the guy who comes round and they will agree on something, but then it will be forgotten about. Both sides need to set up a situation where they are quite clear about what they want and whether it can be done.\n\nThe Convener\n\nIs it a generally held view that an in-house factor would be a step forward?\n\nJim Inness\n\nI think that it is normally the case. At the Fochabers estate, we have a specific factor from Savills, and it is the same for the Glenlivet estate. That works, but I think that the fact that we have this tenants working group up and running is like having a halfway house. We have a meeting with the Crown Estate twice a year and we are starting to involve the factors as well.\n\nWe are intermediaries between them, so there is more accountability creeping in all the time. Accountability is expanding, which has to be good. We have meetings with our own tenants on each estate maybe twice yearly—just as and when necessary. Up to now, those meetings have been pretty well attended—probably 90 per cent of tenants have attended. Their feedback is that this is good and they have never seen this before. So far, it is all positive.\n\nClaudia Beamish\n\nDo the panel members have any brief comments on investment and whether there is a disparity in investment between different tenanted farms and different areas of the Crown estate? Jim Inness said that it is not all about revenue and I understand his point, but is there any concern that there are showcase areas and then other areas that might lose out a bit?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nWe could not possibly comment on that.\n\nJim Inness\n\nI farm on the Crown estate in Glenlivet but I also farm down in Dufftown, which is a different type of ownership altogether. It is chalk and cheese with the different landlords. The Crown Estate in the past was the bee’s knees with regard to investment in farms. Obviously, with the way that costs have crept up for buildings, for example, there is not the same money going about but the Crown Estate is still focused on keeping the farms alive and kicking and replacing buildings as and when needed. It is still an on-going situation. It works out.\n\nHowever, it is not all about money. The farm has to be viable for the future and the buildings need to be up to scratch. The financial plan is pretty good reading. The plan is to grow the portfolio by £2 million in 2018-19. The net revenue would be about £1 million. That is all good but, although the rural estate is worth £96-odd million in capital, the revenue from it is not very clever. That is farming, but it is a key area of the Crown Estate portfolio and it needs to be looked after.\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nWe have an issue, particularly in Applegirth, which has been taken over. My family has been there since before the Crown Estate took over. No proper maintenance is ever done. Investment is now left to the tenants, by and large. The Crown Estate does not invest in dairies, for example. However, we are considering maintenance.\n\nAn audit must be done. Last night, I got an email from Andy Wells who said that one would be done. If the Crown Estate does not know its liabilities, it cannot do a budget. There are so many underlying issues that need to be addressed that have happened over the years. It is not the current lot’s fault—although it is their problem now—but has come from what happened before. Therefore, an audit must be done.\n\nAs tenants, we have the opportunity for an amnesty, whereas we are putting forward our tenant investments. Alongside that, I believe—I think that we all do—that the landlord should understand what his problems are, because he needs to lay aside money to fix the lead pipes and the fallen-down sheds.\n\nThe Convener\n\nSo, to answer Claudia Beamish’s question, there is an inconsistency of approach to investment across the four estates.\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nI agree. In general, the tenants are proud to be Crown Estate tenants. That is refreshing in agricultural tenancies. There probably is a disparity between what happens now and what has happened previously. Brian Shaw mentioned the Applegirth estate in Dumfries and Galloway.\n\nPart of the issue is transparency. There has not been much transparency until now, and it is good to see that theme in the bill. The tenants do not have a lot of input into decisions or understanding of how they are made, so a bit more information might help them to feel confident about investment in future.\n\nAlex Rowley (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab)\n\nI was going to come in later but, because Claudia Beamish touched on the question, I will ask it now. I am really interested in an audit. I assume that the Crown Estate has not done one. Any large organisation—a local authority, for example—would know the condition of its buildings and other assets. Are we saying that the Crown Estate does not?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nAbsolutely. Only when a tenant comes and says that they have a problem because the roof is falling in is it put into the budget. There are many underlying problems about which tenants are honestly frightened to go to the Crown Estate. There are some houses that need a lot of work. However, an audit is not difficult.\n\nA crazy thing that the Crown Estate has done recently is a drive-by audit. I do not understand it. It is perhaps something technical. The factor phoned me up and told me, “I am driving past your farm very slowly. If you wonder what I am doing, I am doing a drive-by audit.” I said, “You’re a kerb crawler.” I do not know how he can value my farm or whatever part of it they are interested in. The snow was on the ground as well.\n\nAlex Rowley\n\nCan I follow that up? One of the questions that I was going to ask was about the benefits from the Crown Estate in terms of investment. Is there cross-investment to target areas of greatest need? If the Crown Estate does not know the condition of its properties, I assume that that is a serious issue.\n\nJim Inness\n\nI think that Brian Shaw down in Applegirth has been disadvantaged for long enough. Up in our neck of the woods, in Fochabers and Glenlivet—we could say that Glenlivet is the showpiece—we have been looked after quite well. The agents come round and look at things, and letters have been sent to me over the past six months when there have been issues, such as with the budget, repairs and so on. I reckon that the Crown Estate has sharpened up its act already.\n\nI would not be too worried just yet, but Brian Shaw is quite right that we need to see where you guys are at with regard to the finances of the rural estate and how much needs to be spent in order to correct things. In all fairness, Applegirth probably needs more money spent on it than Fochabers or Glenlivet. I had experience of the other landlord and it is like chalk and cheese, but we need to keep the momentum going.\n\nThe Crown Estate should be an example of best practice as regards landlords, input and all the rest of it. If you put the money in, you will get delivery. If the farm is healthy—the portfolio of the buildings and all the rest of it—the whole community is healthy. It all filters back to the environment round about. If you look after the farmers, the whole thing falls into place and is kept intact.\n\nHew Hunter\n\nI am on Whitehill estate, which was bought as an investment—the Crown Estate has had a lot of money from it. We had opencast coal mining, but Scottish Coal went bust when it was being put back, so the interim committee has had to pick up the pieces in re-establishing some of my farm. However, there is a quarry elsewhere on the estate and the Crown Estate has been able to sell land for housing behind Rosewell, not far from here.\n\nThere are only three or four of us farmers left on the estate, and we are out of the way of the rest of them. We are being managed from Dumfries now, so our situation is a wee bit like Brian Shaw’s in that agents are not coming up to Whitehill as much to see what needs to be done and what have you.\n\nJim Inness\n\nOur working group has regular meetings with the managing agents, Andy Wells and company. That has got to be a good thing, because we can tease out the negative aspects within the portfolio of the rural estate and try to get some more action on that.\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nAmong its assets, Crown Estate Scotland is responsible for managing 37,000 hectares of rural land, which includes agricultural tenancies, residential properties and so on. In your opinion, what are the wider benefits for rural Scotland of Crown Estate Scotland continuing to hold on to and manage those assets effectively?\n\nJim Inness\n\nAs I said before, for a rural estate it is self-explanatory. If you manage the assets, it pays dividends right down the line in social infrastructures, environmental balance and the whole thing.\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nWhat about employment?\n\nJim Inness\n\nIt pays dividends in employment as well; the whole thing is related to a degree. Post-Brexit it could be negative. It is all relevant. That is a tricky question for the future, given that Brexit is a hidden area—we do not know what will happen with it.\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nI do not think that anybody knows.\n\nJim Inness\n\nNo.\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nThere are huge benefits to retaining the Crown estate as it is. These guys have been really clear from day 1 that they are proud to be tenants and think that the estate is a showcase. It could be a showcase for Scotland if it is done right and the positives are built on.\n\nAs for the agricultural tenants, the estate has a huge number of the secure tenancies that are left in Scotland, and those tenancies provide opportunities and long-term security. I also point out that, with regard to wider food security for Scotland, these guys are a massive part of the economics of these rural areas, and in anything that goes forward, the emphasis must be on giving them stability, particularly with the future of subsidy support, Brexit and so on.\n\nIn summary, then, the estate seems to have been functioning quite well in general, and I have seen no hugely compelling case for splitting it up.\n\n11:00\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nIt was said that you have meetings twice a year, but should you not be having a meeting every month or four times a year to fix the problems that Mr Shaw mentioned earlier?\n\nJim Inness\n\nWe could, but I should point out that, at one point, there were no meetings at all—\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nI know that.\n\nJim Inness\n\nThen there was one per annum, and now there are two.\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nPush for more.\n\nJim Inness\n\nYou could push for more—\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nNo—you push for more.\n\nJim Inness\n\nAye.\n\nThe Convener\n\nBrian, you seem to be in agreement.\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nThat is right. Certain things are coming up. In his email, Andy Wells said that, after our suggestion, the Crown Estate was now going to do this audit—or so we believe—and that it would get in touch with us once it had been organised. That is not the way to go about this. We need to help the Crown Estate organise it to ensure that the job is done correctly and that this is not some top-down thing. We are now part of this infrastructure; in fact, we are buried in the churchyard, so we want to be part of the decision making.\n\nJim Inness\n\nI agree with Brian Shaw. The Smith commission recommended the devolution of more assets down the line; we have made it quite clear that we want the estates to be managed from a national perspective, but now that we are involved in this process, we seem to be this halfway house between the board and the managing agents. The Government seems to have bought into this; it is delivering, to a degree, what the Smith commission suggested, and I think that that should be built on—and indeed expanded—as time goes on.\n\nAs for Richard Lyle’s suggestion of four meetings per annum, it is the same thing as our having meetings with our fellow tenants: you do not have meetings just for the sake of having meetings. The easiest way of ensuring good attendance is to wait until priorities come to the fore and there is something to discuss, such as consultations; indeed, I see that a new one on pilot schemes came out yesterday. That is why you have a meeting.\n\nRichard Lyle\n\nYes, but given you are already in the door, you should be pushing for more. That is my point.\n\nJim Inness\n\nI agree, but we should not have meetings for meetings’ sake. There needs to be something of substance to talk about.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThe door has been opened to another subject, which Finlay Carson will ask about.\n\nFinlay Carson\n\nJim Inness mentioned the possibility of the bill empowering communities to manage their rural assets more. What is the panel’s view on devolving more of that management to local authorities, other public authorities or community organisations? Could Brian Shaw down in Applegirth, say, form a community group to seek to manage assets, given the issues with factoring in the past?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nTo be quite honest, managing my own business is enough of a job. At the level that we are talking about, it is fine; we can get some cohesion with the tenants. However, all that we want to do is help the thing to run smoothly. We do not want to take over, because it works pretty darn good as it is.\n\nJim Inness\n\nCan I come in again? You can shut me up if you want to. [Laughter.] We do not really want things to be devolved down to councils, because Moray Council, for example, has a big enough job running its own show. As you know, it is in deep trouble financially. I should perhaps not say that, but it has already been picked up on.\n\nThe estates that we represent form a big portfolio; you need expertise to manage them, and in my opinion, that expertise lies in Bell’s Brae. Those people have been doing the work for years, and I do not think that we should diverge from the original format in the slightest.\n\nIt is the same with community involvement. Do communities have the money or the expertise to dip their toe in the water? There might be certain avenues—bike trails or whatever—that they could go down, but we in the rural farming sector see it as a no-no.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWhat about the interaction with the wider community around estates? It is not just about the agricultural tenancies. At Tomintoul, there is the village, and other things are going on. How can there be better and wider engagement with local communities in the context of Crown Estate tenants and tenancies?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nWe have created some walks and trails. There was subsidy to help to put them in place. One of the benefits of the approach is that we can regulate where the community comes, rather than have people walking everywhere, willy-nilly. We have made interesting walks along a riverbank and the like. We have nothing to do with the fishings—they are all owned and let out by different people.\n\nI will meet RSPB tomorrow, to do work to try to save the tree sparrow or the house sparrow. People want to talk to us, and we respond.\n\nJim Inness\n\nOver the past 10-plus years, the Crown Estate has been instrumental in putting in bike trails and walks, especially in Glenlivet—it is way ahead of the game on all that; other estates do not do it. There is community involvement in that. We had a meeting with the community association; I think it was around December last year—no, it was further back, because it was in Richard Lochhead’s time. The farmers had their say, and then the community association came in, and everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet. It was all on a par.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nI declare an interest: I am a member of NFU Scotland, although I am not a tenant farmer.\n\nNFU Scotland said in paragraph 9 of its submission:\n\n“The group is not in favour of too much local community or local authority involvement and believes that the estate is best served by retention of the national management structure where possible.”\n\nIs that the panel’s view? Do you think that the structure should remain as it is, with, of course, the enhancement of the stronger community links that you have talked about? Does that encapsulate your position?\n\nHew Hunter\n\nWe have said that we want the estate to stay together.\n\nAt Whitehills, the community has been given an old steading to develop and use. The Bell’s Brae team will have to get better at publicising what the Crown Estate does with communities. A lot of things are not seen. We have trails in some of the woods, and they need to be better publicised.\n\nFinlay Carson\n\nAre people ruling out the opportunity for a group of tenants to come together to form a community group, which could provide factoring services to tenants in Applegirth, for example?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nThat is the next step, I guess. We have a group in Applegirth, which meets and deals with things.\n\nThe farmers are farmers, and they do not want to get too spread out; they want to concentrate on what they are doing, but if there is some way in which we could help, let us hear about it.\n\nKate Forbes\n\nI want to ask about the farm sales framework and how decisions are made about the sale and reletting of farms on the estates. The bill requires the Crown Estate to “maintain and enhance value” of the estate and the return from it. My understanding is that, at the moment, unless there is a clear justification for an alternative, a unit will always be relet for agricultural use—I understand that the same goes for sales.\n\nDoes the panel have any thoughts on whether the new requirements in the bill will have an impact on the farm sales framework, as it stands?\n\nJim Inness\n\nWhy not ask Tom Cattanach to comment on that? He is being very quiet here. He might give you an opinion.\n\nTom Cattanach (Fochabers Estate)\n\nMy opinion is that it should be left the way it is just now. There will be circumstances in which they want to sell a farm, and I think it works well the way it is just now. If you block that, you will shut that off, and it will not be able to happen once the bill has gone through. I would prefer that we were left with the status quo.\n\nKate Forbes\n\nWhat about reletting and sales for agriculture?\n\nTom Cattanach\n\nThat can happen as long as the money is reinvested in something else. A farm should not be sold only for the money to be frittered away; perhaps it could be used to provide a higher income for the Crown Estate.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWhat about the reletting of farms that become available? Should there be a presumption in favour of reletting units to existing Crown Estate farmers, whether or not units are broken up? That could help to strengthen the tenancies that are already there. I accept the point about new entrants, but should that approach be taken as opposed to letting units to people who might be farming already, outwith the Crown Estate? Does anybody have views on that?\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nYou would probably expect me to say yes, but we have discussed that and people are quite keen that it does not always happen like that. The Crown Estate recently let a farm on one of the northern estates, and the tenants there are keen that what they call empire building does not happen. They see anything that becomes vacant as a potential opportunity for the younger guys to come in. I do not think that it is the sort of thing that we can have an inflexible policy on.\n\nTo go back to Kate Forbes’s question about the framework in the bill, it has become apparent during discussions that we are talking about a massive estate and a hugely diverse portfolio with stuff coming in and stuff going out, and the ability to maintain that is crucial to its long-term survival.\n\nThe Convener\n\nCan I push you on the question? It would be good to get clarity. Given what you have said, is there a preference for a unit that becomes available to be let to the next generation—for example, to new entrants who are already involved in the Crown Estate? They could be the sons or daughters of existing farmers who want to branch out themselves. Do you still want it to be done on a wider basis?\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nThere are probably pros and cons to that approach. Given that the majority of the tenancies are 1991 act secure tenancies, those individuals will likely inherit or be able to have farms assigned to them anyway, so we have to question whether that is the right route.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThat would happen eventually.\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nYes.\n\nJim Inness\n\nIn the past 10 years or so, the Forestry Commission has created starter farms. A lot of starter farms have 10-year leases, and at some point they come to an end. The Crown Estate could be a role model in creating opportunities for guys moving up the ladder. By the same token, as has been suggested, we have farmers’ sons branching out with their own structure and taking on farms, and that has to be a good thing. There needs to be a system for people to climb rungs on the ladder, because guys who go through the 10-year leases need that. If no farms are available, they will be dead and buried because they cannot get anywhere.\n\nAs regards rental revenue, Kate Forbes mentioned growing the revenue in the estate, but due account also has to be taken of the sustainability of farms. Empire building is a non-starter for me. On the revenue side and the rents that are achieved, it is not all about maximum revenue. As we have seen in the past, people all too often go for big bucks, and three years down the line the tenant pleads poverty and says, “This isn’t working. I need a rent review and a rent reduction to make it viable.”\n\nAs regards new farms coming on to the scene for let, there has to be a rigorous forward plan of, say, five years, and there has to be financial accountability so that the rent that is offered can be sustained and we do not have the situation of people pleading poverty in three years’ time. It has to be sustainable. However, that does not necessarily grow the estate as regards revenue. You cannot have it both ways.\n\nThe Convener\n\nOkay. Thank you for that.\n\n11:15\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nWe took evidence from the Government’s bill team a couple of weeks ago on the proportion of net revenue that can be retained by asset managers and reinvested back into estates. The figure of 9 per cent was mentioned, which seems to be an historic figure that is based on Treasury rules. I probably know the answer to this already, but is 9 per cent enough? How does a variation of that figure affect the motivation of managers?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nI guess that, if the audit is done, we will know. The part of the world that I come from will need more than that initially and for a few years to come. Three or four farms have already been sold off, and that seems to be where revenue is coming from to afford the keeping up of the estate. If that is to be, it is to be. I do not have a clue about the 9 per cent, but it needs to be enough to do what is needed to keep it tenable.\n\nJim Inness\n\nThere is a cross-subsidising element to the management of the portfolio, as some parts of the estate might not be doing as well as others. If the capital fund is grown and if the 9 per cent is too high, there would not be enough money left to divert or to cross-subsidise to maintain the estate portfolio.\n\nTo come back on one specific point, farm sales are needed at the moment to provide revenue to keep everything mobile and moving forward. However, we do not agree with selling farms from the central part of our rural estate, because it might start off with one farm being sold, but then two are sold, and that leads to fragmentation creeping in, which is not a good idea. Farm sales have to be analysed in full; perhaps one corner could be sold off so that the estate is not fragmented. By the same token, there should be consultation with groups such as ours before any sales or purchases are made. Perhaps I am being a bit self-important with regard to the group, but it is all to do with accountability and making the right decisions for the benefit of the whole portfolio.\n\nThe Convener\n\nTo go back to something that Brian Shaw mentioned a second ago, I think that you would all accept that what you as tenant farmers might deem to be necessary by way of repair and restoration work, the Crown Estate might hold a different view on. How do you envisage compromise and mediation working in practice to come to an agreed position? Inevitably, there will be differences of opinion.\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nLet us start by getting all the houses up to a reasonable standard. At the minute, agricultural laws do not require farmhouses to be up to the lettable standard. It is heading in that direction, but some houses out there are really not very good.\n\nAs far as maintenance and bringing them up to standard is concerned, that will be quite obvious. What has been stopping or retarding that is the fact that there has not been enough money in the budget. This budget is derisory and we do not know where it comes from; I think that it is just the same as last year. Some tenants say, “Oh yes, we’ll do that,” but the onus has to come back to us to tell the bosses what the situation is so that they can afford to put right the estate in a timely manner.\n\nJim Inness\n\nThat is why a repair and investment audit is totally relevant at this juncture, so that we can see where we are financially and for the future.\n\nGemma Cooper\n\nTo build on what Jim Inness said, the Crown Estate calls it an audit, but I call it a record of condition. This is a chance to start afresh, and carrying out records of condition of all the holdings would be really useful. It could be followed by an agreed schedule of works, which would tie in with the estate budgets.\n\nWith regard to wider industry codes, a lot of work is being done by the tenant farming commissioner, which is about behaviour, and I think that that underpins discussions already. I do not see that as necessarily being a source of conflict—it can be just a discussion—but the tenants need information that they do not have currently to be able to be involved in the process.\n\nMark Ruskell\n\nTo go back to the points about the audit and how it might function, will it look at the condition of existing assets or at their economic potential? If there is a farmhouse or an abandoned building on a farm that could be used for bed and breakfast but a substantial investment would be needed to achieve that, would an audit pick that up, or would it merely look at whether the building is falling down and can be retained as it is, abandoned?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nYes, it certainly would pick that up. The picture would be painted and then a decision about what would have to happen would be taken. Sometimes, a building is made redundant and then a bit is maybe knocked off the rent. I have had a building renewed. The problem is that there are leases. That is the problem that the Crown Estate and all landlords and tenants have—there is a lease that has to be adhered to. If a building that someone is paying rent for is falling down, it should be replaced. Whether it is replaced in its traditional form is a moot point.\n\nIn the cases that I have been involved in, buildings have become worn out. I have pointed out to the landlord that I am paying rent on them but they are no good to me, and they have put up something substantial. They have done good. However, quite a few tenants are not able to push that enough. If there were a review, as Gemma Cooper says, we would all start from a level base and then people who are, sadly, behind at the moment would get up to speed.\n\nJim Inness\n\nHouses might be not derelict but not being used. You make the point that diversification is an avenue for the tenant and it can be co-funded by the Crown as landlord. That is food for thought going forward but, at the moment, what happens if the house has never been used and is in a sad old state? What happens if it is in a prime location and a decent spot? The landlord will take the opportunity to sell that site or house and grow the revenue, or the capital budget. There are two ways of looking at it.\n\nAs regards bed and breakfasts and stuff like that, Glenlivet might be overdone already as regards holiday accommodation, but in other areas that could be a useful secondary income. Any of those avenues will be useful post-Brexit if subsidies are going to decline.\n\nDonald Cameron\n\nI refer to my farming interest, which is in the register of interests.\n\nHow should tenant farmers be represented and involved in the decision-making processes of the Crown Estate in this new environment? How would you like to be involved? Do you want the status quo? Do you want more consultation with you as tenant farmers? Do you want a voice in a management structure? What is the best way?\n\nTom Cattanach\n\nThe forum that we have, with two tenants from each estate, is essential going forward, because we can speak with tenants and take forward what they say either to the interim board or direct to Government, if needed. If everybody is in a circle round the table at Bell’s Brae and speaking, we have got to come to good decisions.\n\nJim Inness\n\nThe fact that we are here today giving evidence shows how far we have come. On the question of how we would like things to go forward, we are the farming community that ticks the Smith commission box, and we would like to see our group’s involvement in decision making expand.\n\nDonald Cameron\n\nThe convener touched on this, and it is an interesting scenario. If there was a dispute between a tenant farmer and the Crown Estate as landlord, would that kind of system nip it in the bud? Would it help mediate when there are problems?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nIn light of the above, what are your views on the bill? For example, are additional safeguards or commitments needed in some areas? Many of the witnesses said that you quite like the status quo. You have all said that it is a privilege to be tenants of the Crown Estate, so you are already examples of good practice, but how do you see possible improvements being made?\n\nBrian Shaw\n\nYou mention safeguards in the bill. We are moving in that direction. The bill provides a big improvement for us. We see nothing lacking in the bill that we are looking for. We believe that we are heading in the right direction. We are not propelling the ship; we hope to steer it.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWe will finish on that optimistic note. I thank the witnesses for their time. It has been a useful and constructive meeting.\n\n11:25 Meeting suspended.\n\n11:32 On resuming—\n\nThe Convener\n\nThe third agenda item is to take evidence on the Scottish Crown Estate Bill at stage 1. We will focus on stakeholders who are directly affected by the management of Crown Estate assets.\n\nI welcome Patricia Hawthorn from Scottish Renewables, David Sandison from the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, Mark Simmonds from the British Ports Association and Dr Alan Wells of Fisheries Management Scotland. Good morning to you all. We move straight to questions.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for coming.\n\nI note the diverse range of backgrounds from which you come. What are your experiences of the Crown Estate and Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management)? In your view, what makes for good estate management? Discuss.\n\nDr Alan Wells (Fisheries Management Scotland)\n\nWe have wide-ranging discussions with the Crown Estate. The Crown Estate owns about 140 salmon fisheries across Scotland. It sits on several of the boards of our member organisations, the district salmon fishery boards. We have a close relationship with it on the management of wild fisheries.\n\nWe also work with the Crown Estate on salmon farming, marine renewables and other developments in the marine environment. For example, we are working with the Crown Estate on identifying and assessing methods of monitoring potential impacts on wild fish with regard to Aquaculture Stewardship Council certification for fish farms and the environmental management plans that come through the planning process for salmon farming.\n\nWe work with the Crown Estate on marine renewable leases—we have done a lot of work on the potential impact of marine renewables and offshore wind farms on migratory salmon and sea trout.\n\nPatricia Hawthorn (Scottish Renewables)\n\nGood morning. I am here in my capacity as a director of Scottish Renewables, but I am also a partner in the law firm Shepherd and Wedderburn, which acts for a number of offshore developers, both tidal and offshore wind. I am happy to answer questions from both perspectives, although I am primarily here to represent Scottish Renewables.\n\nThe engagement that we have with the Crown Estate is largely through its role as a landlord in the offshore sector in relation to offshore wind and marine wave and tidal projects. In anticipation of this committee session, I spoke to a number of our members. The description that the Crown Estate offered up for itself on its involvement with renewables as being a\n\n“landlord, catalyst and supportive partner”\n\nwould broadly be echoed by the industry and most of our members.\n\nThe relationship is triggered by the lease process, but the Crown Estate has also been influential in bringing forward licensing rounds for the development of projects and in participating in the delivery of the projects. The supportive role has been important and has ranged from participating in consultations to helping to fund and manage enabling works in the early stages of projects.\n\nBroadly, our engagement is through that landlord and tenant context, but the relationship is a bit wider than that.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nDo you expect that positive relationship that you have had to continue into the future?\n\nPatricia Hawthorn\n\nYes. It has been broadly a positive relationship and an effective and efficient management process.\n\nDavid Sandison (Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation)\n\nLikewise, our relationship with the Crown Estate is mainly based on its being a landlord. We have a significant number of sea bed leases around Scotland’s coastline. Our needs and the scale of the sites that we require for our industry to move forward have developed rapidly over many years, and the landlord-tenant relationship has been productive over that time. Indeed, it is the fundamental relationship, and we view the Crown Estate as a body that has supported our development plans over the years.\n\nMark Simmonds (British Ports Association)\n\nMy association represents the overwhelming majority of ports in Scotland, and most of our members’ engagement with the Crown Estate comes about because the Crown Estate owns most of the sea bed and, in order to carry out and fulfil their statutory duties, our members have to work with it on leases and licences for, say, dredging and maintaining navigable channels. Not all our members have always found that process to be the easiest; it has sometimes been difficult or time consuming, and at times it has added to development costs or caused delays.\n\nIn answer to your question about what would be good as far as the management process is concerned, I would say responsiveness; working with the users of the assets; and ensuring that the process remains affordable. Obviously our members cannot move elsewhere, and they will have to work with the manager of the asset.\n\nThe Convener\n\nAre you reflecting the view across the UK of dealings with the Crown Estate, or are you talking specifically about the experience in Scotland? Is there a difference?\n\nMark Simmonds\n\nWe have found the experience across the UK to be quite similar, but I am speaking today on behalf of our Scottish members.\n\nThe Convener\n\nI was just wondering, because I am interested in finding out, as we move to Crown Estate Scotland, whether you are identifying opportunities for things to be done better.\n\nMark Simmonds\n\nThere is definitely an opportunity for things to be done better, but it remains to be seen whether it will be taken.\n\nThe Convener\n\nHave the delays that your members have been confronted with arisen as a result of environmental concerns, local concerns or other concerns, or have they been caused by the process itself?\n\nMark Simmonds\n\nIt is quite often just the process of, say, extending leases or getting licences for certain activities for which, as I said, our members are statutorily responsible.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThank you.\n\nClaudia Beamish\n\nI want to ask Alan Wells about his percep"
