        "text": "BY age 12, Damien Fahey was running his own pretend radio station in his bedroom, recording his shows on tape. Two years later, he was interning at a local station in Springfield, Mass., and soon after he landed a part-time DJslot.\n\nHe was 22 and just out of college when MTV discovered him at an audition and tapped him to replace Carson Daly as host of “Total Request Live,” and 25 when he was given a one-week tryout to be Craig Kilborne’s replacement as host of “The Late Late Show.”\n\nHe didn’t get the late-night job – but that doesn’t mean he won’t someday. When Fahey, now 26, goes after something he seems to get it. Meet the man who’s schmoozed on-air with everyone from Bono to Jennifer Lopez – and recently did a stint filling in for the ailing Regis Philbin.\n\nWhat was your first radio job like?\n\nI had the overnight shift, from midnight to 6 a.m. My father would drive me to work at 11:30 p.m. and pick me up the next morning.\n\nDid your parents set any rules – like, you have to finish your homework before you go on the radio?\n\nYeah, my mom was really strict about school. My dad was, too, but my mom was more like, “Hey, I don’t want my 14-year-old son being driven to a shady part of town at 11:30 at night to work in a building alone until 6 in the morning.” Whereas my dad was like, “Ithink this is a great opportunity, he should capitalize on it.”\n\nHow did you get a gig like that at such a young age?\n\nI started as an intern. Then two nights a week I’d come in and spend a few hours practicing talking over the music and making fake commercials. I started making demo tapes and sending them to disc jockeys in New York, including Dave Stewart at WPLJ. He’s one of the main reasons I am where I am, because he gave me such great feedback. Eventually I got up the nerve to drop a tape off at this small radio station, and they gave me a shot.\n\nWhat was the transition like from radio DJ to MTV VJ?\n\nIt was pretty difficult, actually. With radio you have to put on this voice, and you can’t be as personable as you can be on television. Television is a little more of an interactive medium, or at least “TRL” is. It took a while to get really comfortable.\n\nWhat is a typical day like for you?\n\nIt changes every day. Yesterday I was up at 7. We had a “TRL” taping at 9, and then I had a photo shoot at 12:30 and a voiceover session for “Family Guy” at 4:30. Today I got up at 10 and I don’t have to be in until 2. It goes from a crazy day of tapings and interviews to a day when I can get up late and go to band practice. Yes, I’m in a band.\n\nDo you ever get nervous at this point?\n\nUsually it’s just the big interviews, like if Madonna is coming by, or Tom Cruise or someone like that. I won’t really get nervous, I’ll just become a bit more focused. I tend to get more nervous on “Regis & Kelly,” just because it’s a new audience and that show is really personality-dependent. It’s all about what you did last night and coming up with funny stories.\n\nWhat’s next for you career-wise?\n\nI’m enjoying where I am, but I’m also keeping in mind that this isn’t a permanent gig. I’d love to do a late-night show. I really like to act as well, and play the drums, so I guess we’ll see. These are all of my passions, and luckily I’m in a good place right now to pursue them."
