        "text": "For other places with the same name, see Glasgow (disambiguation).\n\nGlasgow (Gaelic: Glaschu) is the largest city in Scotland, located on Clydeside in the Central Belt. Glasgow reinvented itself from the 1990s, one of the most successful examples in Britain, with a range of developments in industry, culture, cuisine and architecture. It's now a lively must-see destination meriting several days to explore, and with excellent visitor amenities in all price brackets. Its deep-red sandstone buildings have been scrubbed free of grime and the city is glorious in the sunshine, but it's a year-round place with plenty to occupy the dreich days.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2021 the city had a population of 612,000, with a total of 1.2 million in the Greater Glasgow area, Scotland's largest conurbation. The name derives from ancient Brittonic glas cÃ¶Ã¼, a green hollow, which you will struggle to locate. What you do encounter is a lively year-round destination with lots to see and do.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGlasgow was a small market town until the 18th century, focused on the cathedral, so its \"High Street\" is a modest thoroughfare a mile east of the present centre. It grew rapidly when the 1707 Act of Union allowed Scotland to trade with English overseas colonies, flourishing with the transatlantic trade in tobacco, sugar and slaves. Glasgow's mills and foundries also drew in labour from the west Highlands and Donegal, as those regions lost their traditional smallholding ways of life. But the River Clyde was shallow, so the ports and shipyards grew up 25 miles downstream at Greenock, while a ramshackle flotilla of Cluthas and \"Clyde Puffers\" plied the city river. In the 1880s a deep channel was blasted, so shipyards and other metal-bashing industry developed at Govan. Their wealth created an elegant Victorian West End of mansions and parks, while the inner city earned a reputation as a dirty, rough place of teeming tenements, sectarian tensions, drunken brawls and poor life expectancy. The 1960s saw the collapse of industry and employment, ill-designed new housing schemes, and drug misuse.\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nCity Centre has the transport hubs, most visitor attractions, shopping and entertainment, and the commercial sector. It's an elegant grid of Victorian streets, several pedestrianised, bounded to the south by the Clyde and to north and west by M8. Principal thoroughfares are Argyle Street and Sauchiehall Street running east-west, and Buchanan Street south to north. East side of the centre is marketed as Merchant City, focussed on Glasgow Cross.\n\nEast End: the medieval small town was around the cathedral, then it expanded west around Glasgow Cross. But property development means that the likes of Trongate, Saltmarket, High Street, Gallowgate and London Road now feel instead like the eastern expansion of Merchant City.\n\nWest End is the prosperous district with the University of Glasgow, Hunterian and Kelvingrove Museums, and Botanics, with the small River Kelvin running through. The main thoroughfare is A82 Great Western Road, the traditional road to Loch Lomond and the Highlands, though now you do better to follow M8 then Erskine Bridge. Byres Road is its main north-south route. It's a boho area of cafÃ©s, restaurants and quirky independent stores.\n\nSouth of the Clyde has the football stadiums and Bellahouston Park. Clydebank west of the centre is the former ship-building area, now regenerated with event venues such as the Armadillo, and the Science Centre and Riverside Museum. North of the M8 has little to interest visitors.\n\nGlasgow visitors information website\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish is universal, but such a large city has multiple accents representing its waves of immigration and social strata. One major wave was from the Gaelic-speaking Highlands, and probably for this reason Glaswegian has a sing-song pattern. It can be low and rapid, but whether it's hard to follow depends on whether people have a financial interest in you understanding them. Those in the hospitality sector will make sure you do, no-hope Neds will take pride if you don't.\n\nMost dialect words are common to Scotland, and a remarkable proportion are insults. For instance \"teuchter\" (say \"chookter\") means a Highlander. It had been used by Highlanders to mock southerners trying to pronounce Gaelic, then it got inverted. Glasgow has the world's largest Gaelic-speaking population and that language is being promoted (you'll see it on signage), so perhaps a re-inversion is coming.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nAirport hotels: see Paisley, as the airport is a couple of miles north of that town. Several are within walking distance, others are reached by shuttle bus or taxi.\n\nParking: Pick-up and drop-off costs Â£5 for 15 min. Use Short Stay for up to 90 minutes. There's a range of long-stay parks off-site, with transfer minibuses.\n\nTransport from GLA is usually by bus, there's no railway station.\n\nGlasgow Airport Express takes 15 min from the terminal via Dundas St (for Queen Street Station) to Buchanan Bus Station. It's every 10-15 minutes from 8AM to 11PM and hourly through the night. Tickets cost Â£10 for a single adult, Â£16 for an open return (within 28 days), and can be paid in cash (change is given) or by card, a little cheaper if booked online. Single tickets (but not returns) include an onward transfer to any other First Glasgow bus in the city centre.\n\nFirst Glasgow Bus 77 takes an hour via Renfrew, Braehead, Govan (for QE Hospitals), Partick and Kelvingrove to Buchanan Bus Station. It's every 30 min 5:20AM to 9PM and while it's slow, it may be more convenient for the West End, and cheaper at Â£5.40 for a Dayrider single. (The airport is in \"Local\" zone, so the \"City\" zone fare isn't enough.)\n\nMcGill's Bus 757 trundles every 30 min to Paisley Gilmour Street railway station, which has very frequent trains to Glasgow Central, and outbound to Gourock (for Dunoon ferry), Wemyss Bay (for Bute ferry), Ardrossan (for Arran ferry) and Ayr. The bus takes 15 min by a zigzag route and you could almost walk it in that time; northbound it continues from the airport to Inchinnan, Erskine and Clydebank bus station.\n\nThe west: Bus 926 calls once a day at the airport on the way to Dumbarton, Inverary, Tarbert and Campbeltown. Others on that route, and all buses to Oban, Fort William and Skye, go north of the Clyde, so join them either at Buchanan Station or at Dumbarton.\n\nTaxis to the city centre take 20 min, and in 2023 are about Â£40.\n\n(PIK IATA) is on the Ayrshire coast 32 miles southwest of Glasgow. Its heyday was over 50 years ago when its long fog-free runway served transatlantic flights, but these now land elsewhere. Ryanair is nowadays the only operator, with routes to the Mediterranean and the Canaries, many seasonal. This means Prestwick takes Glaswegians on their holidays but is seldom a route to get into Scotland.\n\nSee Prestwick#Get in for details of the trains to Glasgow Central (with half-price fares for air passengers), Bus X77, and motorway routes.\n\nEdinburgh Airport (EDI IATA) has several routes not available from Glasgow, such as Istanbul, and is easily accessible from Glasgow since it's west edge of Edinburgh, only 35 miles away. See Edinburgh#Get in for the direct bus to Glasgow Buchanan Station, and trams/buses to Edinburgh Haymarket for trains and buses onward.\n\nManchester Airport (MAN IATA) has global connections to rival the London airports. Hourly train services from the airport take five hours to Glasgow Central with a change.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\n\nThe stations are an easy 10-minute walk apart and the route is well signposted, don't take the Subway. Link Bus 389 plies from Central to Queen Street (6 min) and the bus station then back to Central. It's every 15 min M-Sa, 20 min on Sunday, and free if you are holding a through railway ticket.\n\nMost trains within Scotland are run by ScotRail, but for comprehensive times, fares and tickets see National Rail.\n\nFrom Edinburgh all trains start from Waverley and stop at Haymarket then fan out, with four routes to Glasgow.\n\nFastest: The ScotRail Shuttle takes 50 min via Falkirk High to Queen Street, every 15 min on weekdays until 6:30PM, then half-hourly.\n\nFast: LNER trains starting from London King's Cross and CrossCountry from Bristol, Birmingham and Leeds take an hour from Edinburgh to Central.\n\nSlow: 80 min via Bathgate and Airdrie into Queen Street (Low Level) en route to Milngavie or Helensburgh Central, every half hour.\n\nSlower: 90 min via Shotts or Carstairs into Central, hourly.\n\nThe fare is the same by any route: in 2024 a day trip is Â£15 and an open return is Â£20.\n\nFrom London and the south train is quicker and cheaper than plane, once you factor in transport to the airport and check-in times.\n\nWest coast: Avanti West Coast run hourly from London Euston, taking five hours via Crewe, Preston and Carlisle. There are also direct trains from Birmingham (4 hr 30 min) and Manchester Airport and Piccadilly.\n\nEast coast: LNER has hourly trains from London King's Cross via York and Newcastle to Edinburgh, where you change for the shuttle, journey time 7 hours.\n\nOvernight: The Caledonian Lowland Sleeper runs Su-F from London Euston, departing around 11PM to arrive at Glasgow Central by 7:30AM and you can stay aboard to 8AM. (Another portion divides at Carstairs to run to Edinburgh.) The southbound train leaves around 11:30PM to reach Euston at 7AM, again you can stay aboard until 8AM. No trains on Saturday night, and the Highland Sleeper doesn't run via Glasgow. Sleeper compartments have two berths and are sold like hotel rooms, so you won't be sharing with a stranger. Tickets can be booked at any UK mainline railway station or online: in 2024 a single fare is around Â£230 for a two-bunk cabin. You can also just use the sitting saloon, single from Â£50. If you have an existing ticket or rail pass for a daytime train you need to buy a sleeper supplement. Pricing is dynamic: weekends cost more and may sell out. Booking is open 12 months ahead, and you need to print out your e-ticket to present on boarding.\n\nFrom elsewhere in Scotland the other inter-city routes are:\n\nAberdeen via Dundee and Perth: hourly to Queen Street.\n\nInverness via Aviemore and Perth: every two hours to Queen Street.\n\nStirling: every 30 min to Queen Street.\n\nFort William, Oban and Mallaig (for the Hebrides): three trains per day to Queen Street.\n\nStranraer (for Northern Ireland): four trains per day to Central.\n\nAyr via Prestwick Airport and Troon: every 30 min to Central.\n\nDumfries via Kilmarnock: every two hours to Central.\n\nBy road\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1 June 2023, the city centre is a Low Emission Zone. There is a Â£60 penalty charge for driving into the city centre in a non-compliant car or van. Cars built after 2015 generally are compliant, but check online. The zone covers the area between the M8, River Clyde and High Street.\n\nFrom England follow M6, which becomes A74 (M) / M74 from the border. This crosses Beattock Summit at 1029 ft / 314 m, but it's rarely closed by snow.\n\nFrom Edinburgh follow M8 west, but for Glasgow Airport use M73 and M74 to bypass city centre. From Stirling follow M80 south.\n\nFrom the western Highlands follow A82 to Dumbarton, then cross the Clyde on Erskine Bridge onto M8 east, instead of grinding through west end traffic.\n\nCar hire is available from several companies at the airport and in city centre, but you only need it to get further afield. For a tour of Scotland, consider seeing Glasgow and Edinburgh by public transport before picking up the hire car to visit the Highlands, where you certainly do need it.\n\nDon't take a car into city centre if you can avoid it. For a day trip, park up at one of the outlying railway stations, if you can find a space among all the commuter vehicles. Closest in is Shields Road, by the junction of M8 and M74, where you transfer to the Subway. It has 840 spaces and in 2023 you pay Â£5.70 for all-day parking plus the Subway fare, see below. It closes at the same time as the Subway so it's not for overnight stays. There is no Park & Ride with a dedicated connecting bus - one was established at Hampden but folded with covid.\n\nBest option for central parking is one of the many multi-storeys. These are clearly signposted into \"East\", \"West\", \"North\" and \"South\" zones on the approach roads, with a display showing how many spaces are left. They don't, however, differentiate between the expensive NCP car parks and the cheaper ones inside shopping centres or run by the council. Check what your accommodation has to offer: in city centre they'll probably just direct you to the nearest multi-storey. West End hotels may have their own car parks but charge. On-street parking is too scarce, time-limited and expensive for sight-seeing.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nis the hub for inter-city buses. It's in city centre, just north of Queen Street railway station off Killermont Street, and ranged around a square. West side has a small mall with toilets, ticket office, news shop and luggage store, but no cafe or retail, head out into the street. Long distance bus stands (48-57) are down this side, eg Scottish Citylink to Belfast, Oban, Skye, Inverness, Edinburgh city and airport, and Aberdeen. Here too are National Express and Megabus for London. The Glasgow Airport bus departs from stand 47 on the southwest corner. The north and south stands are for medium-distance destinations such as Kilmarnock and Fife, and the east stands are only for tour buses.\n\nEmber Electric Buses glide ever so quietly from Dundee every two hours daytime, with two night runs, for a single fare in 2022 of Â£8.50. They take two hours via Perth Broxden P&R, Dunblane, Stirling Castleview P&R and Cumbernauld.\n\nCity buses and those to nearby towns don't come into the station, find them out on the street. Those are the daytime buses for Balloch, Bearsden, Dumbarton, East Kilbride, Milngavie, and one of the routes to Paisley; and all the night buses. The main taxi stand is north side of the station.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Ireland you sail to Cairnryan near Stranraer, by either Stena from Belfast or P&O from Larne. The crossing takes 2 hr 30 min, with almost a dozen car ferries a day. Without a car, take the daily bus from Belfast via Cairnryan and Ayr to Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nFrom Europe the nearest ferry port is Newcastle upon Tyne, with overnight ferries from IJmuiden near Amsterdam.\n\nGlasgow itself has never been a liner port. Ferries from the Clyde islands and Argyll peninsula sail to ports \"doon the water\" at Gourock, Wemyss Bay and Ardrossan. In the twentieth century paddle steamers ran between Glasgow and other Clyde ports, this continues with occasional sailings of the PS Waverley but these are only a realistic option for a day trip from Glasgow.\n\nBy canal: you can get here from Edinburgh, Linlithgow, Falkirk and Dumbarton by boat. Small craft must give notice so that locks and low bridges can be opened, kayaks and canoes can portage, and it's a pleasant hiking or cycle route, see \"Further out\" below.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nStrathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) is the local agency which operates the Subway, a few specialist bus services and co-ordinates public transport in the Greater Glasgow area. Glasgow's public transport system is one of the most extensive in the UK outside of London.\n\nThis is the best way to see city centre and the East End. Many streets (eg Sauchiehall St) are pedestrianised, and all areas have proper pavements, with pedestrian crossings at major junctions. The River Clyde also has road and foot bridges. The main impediment as you head north or west is the M8, with dingy underpasses and bridges.\n\nKelvingrove is two miles west, and Glasgow University campus even further, so you might prefer Subway or bus.\n\nBy Subway\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Subway is a loop around city centre, West End and inner suburbs. It's the third oldest subway system in the world, after London and Budapest, and at times has smelled that way. It's now modern and pleasant enough to use, but has never expanded beyond its original loop. Always call it simply the Subway, rather than the \"underground, \"metro\", or \"tube\" (a Scottish insult), and never \"the clockwork orange\", which is a myth created for tourists. The gauge is only 4 ft (1219 mm), so any chubby passengers will need to breathe in as they step aboard the rinky-dinky coaches.\n\nIt's described as an inner and outer circle but that just means the direction of travel, with the outer circle running clockwise. Going anti-clockwise on the inner circle, the Subway runs from the city centre to West End and Glasgow University, south under the Clyde to Ibrox Stadium then back into the city, with each orbit taking 24 min. Use St Enoch for Central and Argyle St stations, and Buchanan St for the bus station and Queen Street station. No bikes are carried, and wheeled access to platforms is limited.\n\nThe system runs M-Sa 6:30AM-11:30PM and Sunday 10AM-6PM, with trains every 4-8 minutes. There's a flat fare regardless of distance, which by cash at any station in 2023 is Â£1.75 single, Â£3.30 return, day ticket Â£4.20. Smartcards are cheaper if you're doing a lot of travel but are unlikely to benefit short-stay visitors. They're free if ordered in advance to a UK address, or Â£3 if bought at the station for immediate use, and can be topped up with any amount from Â£5. Your first journey of the day is Â£1.55, then with the second the total is capped at Â£3 for all-day travel. See below for the SPT ZoneCard & Roundabout ticket.\n\nThe Plusbus rail ticket add-on does not include the Subway.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nLines radiate from Central and Queen Street stations to the suburbs and surrounding towns. There isn't a separate entity called a suburban railway, these services are all part of the mainline Scottish network, so the National Rail website has full details of times, fares, real time running and station facilities. The only difference is that local trains stop at dozens of small places that the inter-city trains flash through. They're primarily commuter routes and visitors would only use them for the few outlying attractions that are beyond the Subway loop and inconvenient by bus. For instance to reach Holmwood House and Linn Park, take the train from Central to Cathcart: these run every 30 min and take 12 min on their way to Neilston, and an off-peak return is less than Â£3.\n\nBikes go free, but many trains have no bike spaces. See below for the SPT Zonecard & Roundabout day ticket.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst Glasgow is the principal bus operator within the city. Buses on main routes are every 10 min or better during working hours and on Saturday, but become sparse in the evening and on Sunday.\n\nCheck from the sign on the bus stop that your intended route stops there, and signal clearly as the bus approaches; the driver won't stop for folk just milling about.\n\nFirst buses do not give change: you put your money in a slot that checks the amount and deposits it in a storage box. Better still, use a bank card to tap in and out. In 2023 a single ticket within the city costs Â£1.95 and a day ticket is Â£5.40. The bank card charges are capped at this amount. A one-week city ticket is Â£20.40. Higher charges apply beyond the city zone (such at the airport), and tickets are only valid on First buses.\n\nHalf a dozen other operators ply to the outlying towns: these include McGill's, JMB, Stuart's, McColl's, West Coast Motors and Stagecoach West Scotland. They each sell tickets valid only on their own services.\n\nCombi-fares\n\n[edit]\n\nSPT offers tickets valid over several travel modes and different bus operators, but they're mostly aimed at regular commuters.\n\nThe ZoneCard is for a minimum seven days, valid for all daytime buses plus Subway and Scotrail trains, and ferries if you buy zones far enough out. A seven-day card valid for the two city zones (basically north and south of the Clyde) is Â£20.90 in 2023. Buy them from mainline railway stations, and you need to bring a passport-style photo of yourself.\n\nThe Roundabout day ticket (Adult Â£7.40) is valid on Subway & Train in the Greater Glasgow area after 9AM and all day at weekends and local public holidays.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditional cabs can be hailed from the roadside - look for the yellow \"Taxi\" sign, illuminated when available. The fleet is operated by Glasgow Taxis, and can be ordered by phone (+44 141 429 7070). There are taxi ranks outside Buchanan Bus Station, Central and Queen Street railway stations, adjacent to George Square and along the southern end of Queen Street. The cabs seat five or six and are wheelchair accessible. From city centre to the West End you might pay Â£6 in 2023. They also offer guided tours.\n\nPrivate cabs must be pre-booked by phone or app. There are multiple operators, somewhat cheaper than traditional cabs, and display a yellow Glasgow City Council licence number at the back. They include Uber, Glasgocabs (+44 332 5050), Executive Cabs (+44 7825 911179), Saltire (+44 141 319 5344) and Deuce Private Hire (+44 141 222 2222).\n\nUnlicensed taxis lurk for trade especially around pub closing time. Don't use them, their fare may include a demand for sexual services.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nA foot-passenger ferry plies every 30 min or so between Yoker on the north bank of the Clyde and Renfrew on the south. It's a cute rinky-dinky affair, bikes can be carried. The Renfrew pier is within walking distance of Braehead shopping centre and the Xscape leisure complex.\n\nA bridge between Yoker and Renfrew is under construction and expected to open in autumn 2024 - this may spell the end of the ferry.\n\nBy bike\n\n[edit]\n\nOVO Bikes offer app-based cycle hire in Glasgow. Bikes and e-bikes cost Â£1 for 20 minutes, or Â£10 for the day. Bikes are hired and returned to stations around the city.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nEast End\n\n[edit]\n\nThis was the medieval centre of Glasgow until the 18th century, when the city grew rapidly along the Clyde.\n\nCity centre\n\n[edit]\n\nCalled Merchant City in tourist material, this is the confident Victorian heart of the city, bounded by M8 and the Clyde.\n\nThe Mural Trail is a series of street-artworks painted on any available bare wall. They come and go, see the website for the latest. In 2022 they included St Mungo as a rough sleeper, Honey I shrunk the kids, and da Vinci's \"Mona Lassie\".\n\nWest End\n\n[edit]\n\nThis prosperous, elegant quarter lies along the River Kelvin, with Glasgow University, multiple attractions and quality accommodation.\n\nCountry Surgeon Micro Museum is in the Wolfson Medical Building on University Ave, a block west of Gilbert Scott Building. It exhibits the life and times of James Douglas (1798-1882), who practised medicine and surgery for 60 years in Carluke. It's open M-F 9AM-5PM, free. For specialist visitors there's a separate Anatomy Museum, by appointment.\n\nClyde & South\n\n[edit]\n\nClyde Tidal Weir spans between Glasgow Green and Adelphi Street. It was built in 1901 to maintain a constant water level upstream, with its three gates adjusting for tidal or river flow. The motive was to create a constant head of water for industry, but other benefits are in stabilising the river banks, and creating a pleasant freshwater channel through Glasgow Green submerging what had been tidal mud flats. There's no public access over the weir.\n\nis a footbridge between Broomielaw near Central station on the north bank, and Tradeston and Kingston on the south bank. Opened in 2009, it's known as the \"Squiggly Bridge\" for its distinctive S-shape. The reason for this was to create clearance for small boats on the Clyde, by making the bridge longer not steeper.\n\nCentral Mosque is south end of Gorbals St Bridge. Built in 1983, it's a striking mix of Arabian, modern, and traditional city red sandstone. Its religious affiliation is Deobandi Sunni Islam. It's open M-F 10:30AM-4:30PM.\n\n, opened in 1970, carries the seething five-lane M8. There's no walkway, so pedestrians and cyclists should use Tradeston footbridge or Clyde Arc. Traffic volumes beyond its design capacity, and shoddy construction, necessitated a decade of repairs from 1990, with the entire bridge lifted on jacks while its piers were replaced. Completion of M74 southern city bypass in 2011 has reduced some of the traffic pressure. Southbound visitors should think ahead which motorway they're joining on the other side (choice of Carlisle, Prestwick or Glasgow Airport) as this is no place for hysterics over a crumpled map or misfiring Satnav. On foot, you can admire its arches and murals from Broomielaw below.\n\nis known as the \"Squinty Bridge\" as it crosses the river at an angle and has a curved steel arch. Opened in 2006, it carries Finnieston Street (vehicles, cycles and pedestrians) between Anderson Quay north bank and Govan south. In 2008 one support cable snapped and a second was found to be cracking, so two years of repairs followed. Since then the dual-carriageway bridge has reserved one carriageway for public transport, reducing the weight of general traffic.\n\nThe giant metal armadillo turns out on closer inspection to be Clyde Auditorium. See \"Do\" for this and the adjacent Exhibition Centre.\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nA summary of some of the styles and gems described in other sections\n\nMedieval and earlier: the East End has Provand's Lordship, but early years have few remnants here.\n\nVictorian: the city sprang up in a profusion of Italianate, neo-Grecian and Gothic styles. Its housing was in tall sandstone tenements, traditionally grimy but now scrubbed up to their glowing red glory. The most florid are known as \"Glasgow Baroque\", top examples being Kelvingrove Gallery in the West End, and Athenaeum Theatre on Buchanan St.\n\nCharles Rennie Macintosh (1868-1928) did for Glasgow what GaudÃ­ did for Barcelona, with his unique exterior and interior unified style. The best example is the House for an Art Lover (south of Clyde); the Glasgow School of Art has twice been ravaged by fire and Scotland Street School is closed for rebuilding.\n\nModern: the \"armadillo\" of the Scottish Exhibition Centre graces the north bank of the Clyde.\n\nFurther out\n\n[edit]\n\n, completed in 1790, runs from the Forth estuary below Falkirk (where the ingenious Wheel connects it to the Union Canal to Edinburgh) via Kirkintilloch into the north of Glasgow. The main canal continues west to join the Clyde near Dumbarton, while a spur branches south for two miles to Port Dundas near city centre. Reach it by walking north up Cowcaddens Rd onto Garscube Rd under the M8, and join the well-signed cycleway. The towpath is a good paved track on the west bank of the spur, lined with restored 18th- and 19th-century warehouses before becoming a woodland linear park. There are no gradients on the spur, but \"stop-locks\" were fitted in wartime in case bombing broke the banks and flooded the factories below. The spur meets the main canal at Stockingfield footbridge, built in 2022 and surrounded by weird statues such as the monster \"Bella the Beithir\". The canal is navigable all the way to Edinburgh, but they need notice to open the locks and low bridges - these are easily portaged by canoe or kayak.\n\nwas laid out in the 19th century to serve the teeming city south side. It's named for Mary Queen of Scots, who lost the Battle of Langside nearby in 1568, and was fugitive or captive for much of her remaining twenty years. \"Queens Park\" also is the name of a football team, but they nowadays play at Firrhill, see Football below. The hill has good views north and is a popular sledging spot in winter. Earthworks round its summit were probably a Norman motte-and-bailey redoubt. Take the train from Central to Mount Florida or Queens Park, 10 min.\n\nlies south of Holmwood House across the White Cart Water, cross either upstream by the Ha'penny Bridge or downstream by the Snuff Mill Bridge. There are bosky dells and a golf course. At the north end on Court Knowe, only a few foundation scraps remain of Cathcart Castle.\n\nAntonine Wall was the Roman frontier defence built across the narrow waist of Scotland from 142 AD. Its western sections have mostly been lost, but in 2023 the buried remains of a fort were found at Carleith near the Auchentoshan distillery. Nothing to see there and the site is not being excavated: go further east for the Roman bathhouse at Bearsden and substantial earthworks around Kilsyth. The wall was only garrisoned for 20 years then they retreated to the more substantial Hadrian's Wall.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nGlasgow has a big music scene in all genres.\n\nSub Club is a basement nightclub and music venue within Classic Grand, open F Sa 11PM-4AM.\n\nOVO Hydro the third on the Event Campus was completed in 2013. It has an all-seater capacity of 12,300 and 14,500 with standing.\n\nArts and theatrical venues\n\n[edit]\n\nCinema\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most interesting films in Glasgow are shown at:\n\nAs I was out a-walking, I chanced to see the Queen, playing at the fitba wi' the lads on Glasgow Green\n\nThe captain o' the ither side was scoring in great style, the Queen she called a polisman and had 'im clapped in jail\n\n- Trad ballad \"And wi' you my Johnny lad\"\n\nGlasgow has Scotland's national stadium and four pro men's soccer teams. The most famous rivalry is the \"Old Firm\": Celtic (in green and white hoops) is traditionally supported by Catholics, and Rangers (in blue) by Protestants. Since 2018 both stadiums sell out to their own fans, with very little ticket allowance to \"away\" supporters or neutral visitors. You should have no trouble getting tickets to other games.\n\nLesser Hampden is a small stadium west side of Hamden Park which in 2023 is expected to become the home of Queens Park FC, see below. So the marketing people have until then to come up with a better name for it.\n\nSee the club website for tickets, stadium and museum tours, and merchandise. In summer 2023 Rangers opened a new museum and events space called 'New Edmiston House'. The official Glasgow City Sightseeing tour bus will take you to Ibrox Stadium on the city tour from summer 2023 where the stadium, museum and club shop can be visited. (updated May 2022)\n\nQueen's Park (\"The Spiders\") were promoted in 2022 and now play in the Championship, the second tier. Historically they played at Hampden Park and owned it, but their limited fortunes and attendance made that a nonsense; only in 2019 did they turn professional. Hampden Park was sold to the Scottish Football Association and Queen's Park are sharing other clubs' grounds - in 2022/23 they play at Ochilview in Stenhousemuir near Falkirk. Don't confuse them with Queen's Park Rangers, the team from London Shepherd's Bush.\n\nGlasgow City FC are a women's team playing in the Scottish Women's Premier League, their top tier and are reigning champions. They're not affiliated to any men's club, and play at Petershill Park in Springburn two miles north of city centre. That makes them the leading women's team within Glasgow, as Celtic and Rangers women play out of town.\n\nRugby Union\n\n[edit]\n\nGlasgow Warriors are the city's professional club, playing in the United Rugby Championship (formerly Pro-14), the predominantly Celtic super-league. Their home ground is Scotstoun (capacity 7300), five miles northwest of city centre. This occasionally hosts internationals but those are usually at Murrayfield in Edinburgh.\n\nGlasgow Hawks play in the Premiership, the amateur top tier in Scotland. Their home ground is Balgray Stadium (capacity 3000) in Kelvinside two miles northwest of the centre.\n\nGlasgow Hutchesons Aloysians or G-HA were relegated in 2023 so they play in National League One, the second tier. Their home ground is GHA Park in Giffnock, five miles south of city centre.\n\nCartha Queens Park also play in National League One. Their home ground is Dumbreck, north end of Pollok Country Park.\n\nGlasgow Academicals were promoted in 2023 so they also now play in National League One, at New Anniesland to the northwest of the city.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nDistillery and brewery tours: see Drink below.\n\nIce Hockey: Glasgow Clan play Sept-April in the Elite Ice Hockey League, the UK's top tier. Their home rink is Braehead Arena in Renfrew.\n\nShinty: Glasgow Mid-Argyll were relegated in 2023 and now play in Mowi National Division, the second tier. Their home ground is Peterson Park in Yoker. The playing season is April-Sept.\n\nSteam railway excursions run from Glasgow in summer: one operator is Tornado Railtours.\n\nGlasgow Central Tours explore Central Station and its place in the life of the city.\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nCeltic Connections is a music festival in January, several venues. The next is probably 17 Jan - 3 Feb 2025, tbc\n\nGlasgow Film Festival is in Feb / March. The next is probably 27 Feb - 10 March 2025, tbc.\n\nGlasgow International Comedy Festival is in March, with the next on 12 - 30 March 2025.\n\nGlasgow International is a festival for contemporary art held in alternate years, with the next probably on 5-21 June 2026, tbc.\n\nGlasgow Jazz Festival is mid-June. The next is probably 11-15 June 2025, tbc.\n\nWestFest is held throughout June, with the next probably 6 - 29 June 2025, tbc.\n\nGlasgow Real Ale Festival is probably next held 5-7 July 2025 at The Briggait on the riverbank, tbc.\n\nOrange Parades are held in the run-up to 12 July, the anniversary (allowing for the change in calendar) of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. These are a piece of living history and used to be huge. Nowadays it's usually a series of small parades (with marchers outnumbered by police) rather than one big one.\n\nTrnsmt is a rock music festival on Glasgow Green, with the next probably on 11-13 July 2025, tbc.\n\nMerchant City Festival is an arts and music festival in July. The next is 19-21 July 2024.\n\nThe World Pipe Band Championships are held on Glasgow Green in mid-August, with the next on 16-17 Aug 2024.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nJobs in Glasgow can be found through the government-run JobCentres. Employment prospects rise and fall with the general economy, but usually the problem is not in finding a paying job, but finding accommodation affordable on that wage. To work legally you must have a National Insurance number and be a citizen of the UK or Ireland - other EU / EEA citizens are no longer eligible unless they have \"settled\" status in the UK. You may find bars and nightclubs offer work cash-in-hand and don't inquire about immigration status.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland's largest city of course has the largest choice of retail, in all sectors: standard chains, independent and specialty shops, and markets. The principal area is west of George Square and the bus station, along the pedestrianised malls of Argyle Street, Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street. There are more independents a block or two back on Bath Street and Hope Street. Glasgow is not immune to the hollowing-out of the traditional \"High Street\", but its centre is less blighted than most by empty retail lots, charity shops and vape stores. Byres Road in the West End has quirky independents, such as De Courcy's Arcade (a block back on Cresswell Lane) with craft shops and cafes. There are large retail parks on the city outskirts at Braehead, Silverburn and Glasgow Fort.\n\nPrinces Square is a mall off Buchanan St 100 yards east of Central Station. The stores close at 6PM but the food court stays open daily to 10PM.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nTis beautiful to see the ships passing to and fro, Laden with goods for the high and the low;\n\nSo let the beautiful city of Glasgow flourish, And may the inhabitants always find food their bodies to nourish.\n\n- William McGonagall, who else\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nFish & chips: There are dozens and dozens of mostly takeaways with only a few sit-in cafes. Along with \"fish suppers\" they offer burgers, haggis, pakoras, pizzas and kebabs, and some daunting combinations that would be called \"fusion\" if they were ten times more expensive. A Munchy Box is a bit of everything and is woozy post-pub fare. The deep-fried Mars Bar is also available: see Stonehaven#Eat for its oily social history.\n\nCity centre\n\n[edit]\n\nPurrple Cat at 2 Trongate (foot of Gallowgate) rescues cat and the cafe is swarming with them. It's open daily 9:30AM-8PM.\n\nElsewhere\n\n[edit]\n\nPalm Tree Kitchen[dead link] is a Yemeni cafe at 22 Bridge St just south of the Clyde and Central Station, open Su-W 9:30AM-9:30PM, Th-Sa 9:30AM-10:30PM.\n\nGrain and Grind is a good coffee shop at 45 Old Dumbarton Rd opposite Kelvingrove, open daily 8AM-5PM.\n\nGusto & Relish is a great cafe at 729 Pollockshaws Rd just north of Queen's Park, open daily 9AM-5PM.\n\nSunny Acre at No 745 likewise gets good reviews. There's also another branch of Grain and Grind here, but not as well-regarded.\n\nMcMonagles is a fish & chips restaurant on a boat moored in the canal next to Clyde Shopping Centre, open daily 11AM-9PM.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nItalian\n\n[edit]\n\nDi Maggio's has three outlets east flank of Central Station (at 87 St Vincent St, 21 Royal Exchange St and 55 St Enoch Square) with another near the bus station at 163 West Nile St.\n\nNonna Said, opened in 2021, is a pizzeria at 26 Candleriggs. It's open daily noon-10PM.\n\nVegetarian\n\n[edit]\n\nRose & Grants[dead link] is a mostly vegan cafe at 27 Trongate next to the theatre, open M-Sa 8AM-5PM, Su 9AM-4:30PM.\n\nSuissi (Subway: Partick) is an excellent Asian vegan restaurant at 494 Dumbarton Rd, open Tu-F 5PM-10PM, Sa 1PM-10:30PM, Su 1PM-9PM.\n\nIndian\n\n[edit]\n\nLots and lots and lots, mostly in the Charing Cross area at the west end of Sauchiehall Street.\n\nAnd see Splurge for Mother India and Killermont Polo Club.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nZique's is a lively European restaurant at 66 Hyndland St (100 yards north of Partick Duck Club) open Su-W 9AM-4PM, Th-Sa 9AM-10PM.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo Fat Ladies have two outlets. The main restaurant is The Buttery at 652 Argyle St, west flank of Junction 19 of M8, Tu-Su noon-10PM. The smaller city branch is at 118 Blythswood St, open W-Sa. Both serve great contemporary Scots cuisine.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nPubs were the traditional meeting rooms of the city, where the world was put to rights over a pint and dram or three, be that fitba', weather, politics or the holidays. They were grand welcoming places so long as you were male, white, and of the pub-appropriate religion. They catered to a tribal, tightly-knit society that worked together, lived close together, went to the match together, and in \"The Trades\" went en masse to the same beach resorts. There was stupid violence, but also camaraderie and quixotic generosity - \"It's ma round!\" Their wives waited at home with their hair in a tight bun and their faces pinched even tighter, clutching rolling pins not for vengeance but to defend themselves and the weans.\n\nA counter-charge was led from the prosperous West End by a troupe of formidable women all called Margot, who preferred wine and spirits. But the big changes in drinking culture from the 1990s were those at large in British society, allied to Glasgow's civic renaissance. Workplaces were smaller and folk lived out in the suburbs. Trad pub culture declined, and proprietors realised they'd make more money by offering decent meals, and even more from tapas. Pubs became female-friendly and family-friendly, and the growth of university education brought in a cosmopolitan student clientele. And the weather improved - let's hear it for climate change! Summer evenings with the wine-of-the-day on blackboards, strappy dresses and smell of garlic, Glasgow is nowadays on the Med.\n\nPubs are wary of anything that looks like a \"lads' outing\" even if not football-related - stag groups are notorious and often \"pre-loaded\" with supermarket spirits.\n\nCity centre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe trad drinking stretch is along Sauchiehall Street between Queen Street Station and Charing Cross. Merchant City, towards Strathclyde University campus, is more upmarket but with lots of student dives. The west part of Merchant City is also the \"pink triangle\". Lots of pubs claim to be LGBTQ+ friendly, they want the income, but the attitude of the clientele or on nearby streets may be something else.\n\nThe Absent Ear is a quirky basement bar on Brunswick St, within Amsterdam Hotel. They're aiming for Vincent-van-Speakeasy, and open Tu-Th 5PM-1AM, F-Su 3PM-1AM.\n\nWest End\n\n[edit]\n\nFocused around Byres Road and Ashton Lane, this is more upmarket and you're more likely to encounter a dress code.\n\nOran Mor Whisky Bar: See Do / Arts & Theatre for this place on Byres Road.\n\nElsewhere\n\n[edit]\n\nDistilleries & breweries\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2023 many tours remain suspended, but you might still like to sample their product.\n\nCrossbill is a gin micro-distillery south side of Barras marketplace. They offer a gin school, where you learn to blend your own. They're open M-F 10AM-5PM.\n\nIllicit Spirits make gin and rum entirely legally at 12 Cook St G5 8JN, under the railway arches by O2 Academy.\n\nStrathclyde Distillery is across the river from Glasgow Green. It's the whisky distillery for Chivas Brothers, part of Pernod Ricard, with most produce blended into well-known brands: Chivas Regal, Ballatine's, Scapa, 100 Piper, and dozens more. That means they're big, and the southside gets a good whiff of their industry depending on wind direction. No tours, but every bar and supermarket stocks their range.\n\nJacobite Spirits make spiced rum out east at Rutherglen. They go big on the Bonnie Prince Charlie connection, but like most 18th century gentlemen he drank copious amounts of French brandy. A series of wars with France cut the supply and fostered the Scottish whisky business.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nSee Paisley for the hotels around Glasgow Airport.\n\nAll short-term accommodation in Scotland must be registered, otherwise it's illegal and probably a flea-pit or fire-trap. The law (which does not apply to England) was introduced in 2022 but there is considerable wriggle room until July 2024, so for the time being proprietors can reasonably say that their registration is still being processed. Be increasingly sceptical as the deadline approaches. It's a bit of unwelcome extra bureaucracy for B&Bs, campsites and so on but in the long-term should better protect travellers and honest providers.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nTravelodge is round the corner from the Hilton at 5 Hill St.\n\nHouse of Gods on Glassford St opens in March 2024.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nGlasgow's rough reputation is a thing of the past and you are unlikely to encounter problems unless you're drunk, stupid or very unlucky. The city centre, drinking areas and transport hubs are well-policed especially around match days and pub closing times. Further out are tatty estates (Possilpark, Easterhouse, Drumchapel, Castlemilk, Pollok) with drug-related violence; you have simply no reason to be there. Govanhill (south side) also gets a bad rep.\n\nExercise caution around the 'Four Corners' area (where Argyle Street, Union Street and Jamaica Street intersect); even in daytime, the fast food places at each corner attract a fair number of 'neds' (= non-educated delinquents). The area going from the Citizens Theatre in the Gorbals towards Bridge Street Subway station can seem unsettling at night-time. Also, taxi queues in the city centre after the pubs have shut can get a bit lairy.\n\nWearing a football shirt, especially Celtic or Rangers, marks you as a member of a tribe. There's safety in numbers, but as an individual you risk being targeted â€” watch any TV nature documentary about wolves and deer for what might happen. Many bars ban all football colours, as if Grimsby Town ever did them any harm.\n\nIt is illegal to \"kerb-crawl\" looking for paid sex, or to solicit custom. The police keep a close watch on likely areas, such as the draughty fringes of the M8: payment for sex is not illegal, but the girls and boys are often funding a drug habit or other abuse that needs to be curbed. That leggy blonde in the alley may be a plain-clothes female PC, who will take you back to hers for a chat about your eventful trip to Glasgow, and whether your permission to visit the UK is at an end.\n\nCall 999 in an emergency, but for lesser incidents call the police on 101. Police Scotland the national force has a \"Safe Nights Out\" guide.\n\n999 is also the way to reach Scotland's Fire & Rescue Service - the \"and Rescue\" is a major part of their work, such as cutting people out of mangled cars, or inland water rescue. Until 2005 the Glasgow Humane Society, founded in 1790, was the doughty group that fished you out of the Clyde. But mustachio'd derring-do was no match for fast-flowing waters with hidden obstructions, and a solitary volunteer rescuer was a recipe for making a bad situation worse.\n\nStay healthy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a medical emergency, dial 999 or 112, free.\n\nFor anything less than emergency, dial 111, free. This connects you to NHS24 who can advise, and direct you to assistance such as late-night pharmacies. Glasgow does not have an NHS walk-in centre.\n\nThe two closest hospitals with Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments are:\n\nThe rules on access by overseas visitors to NHS care apply nationwide, see Scotland#Stay healthy. In brief, the NHS always provides lifesaving immediate care free. Anything beyond is free to residents of the UK or Ireland, and residents of the EEA or Switzerland with an EHIC card to prove it. This includes maternity care and treatment for pre-existing conditions.\n\nConnect\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of Jan 2022, city centre has 5G with all UK carriers. 5G coverage with Three and Vodafone extends out to the suburbs, airport, and along M8 towards Edinburgh. Wifi is widely available in public places.\n\nCope\n\n[edit]\n\nConsulates\n\n[edit]\n\nAlways check your country's embassy website first - help for things like stolen passports and emergency travel documents might be organised from the London embassy or even your home country rather than a local consulate. There are also several consulates in Edinburgh."
