        "text": "About Us\n\n\"Happiness comes when you believe in what your doing, know what you are doing, and love what you are doing\"\n\nPremier Weddings and Events Scotland was founded in 2007 by Cheryl and Lucy Swanson. Cheryl and Lucy are best friends,as well as sisters, with very complimentary business skills.\n\nCheryl has significant experience in all areas of business, graduating with a BA:Hons Marketing from the Business School at Strathclyde University Glasgow in 1999. Her introduction to event management came whilst working at Coca Cola Enterprises Ltd and she has never looked back. Co-ordinating events comes naturally to Cheryl and as her wedding industry knowledge, expertise, wedding venue contacts and high end supplier list grows, so does her dedication to unique and bespoke weddings.\n\nLucy graduated as a school teacher from Strathclyde University, with a BEd:Hons in Primary Education. Predominately known for her energetic disposition and her people skills, her employment as a sports coordinator gave her her initial event planning experience. Even though she has successfully managed different sporting events for hundreds of individuals across Scotland and the USA, it was her love of weddings that directed her towards wedding planning. Lucy has a firm belief that Scotland is the ultimate destination wedding location and that all wedding requests and dreams can be played out on its stage.\n\nBoth sisters share a passion and enjoyment of Scotland, and weddings, that is second to none. They take pride in delivering weddings in Scotland that are perfect, memorable and stress free for the brides and grooms.\n\nIf you would like a no obligation wedding consultation please get in touch.\n\nOur Service\n\nIt's your day. It's all about you!\n\nWe provide a bespoke, highly personalised wedding coordination service. We believe a wedding should be a reflection of the couple and represent what matters to them. No two people in the world are the same and we believe no two weddings should be the same.\n\nIt's these beliefs that form the foundations for our tailored, flexible and very personal service.\n\nWe can do full service coordination ( everything for you) through to you cherry-picking a few elements for us to help with, right through to just the on the day coordination. It's your choice.\n\nCommunication is key, and an area we excel in. From the outset we pride ourself on spending a great deal of time understanding exactly what your needs and wants are, your budget, and your vision for your big day. It's this knowledge, and the relationship that we develop with the couple, that enables us to deliver exactly what you envisage, exceeding all your expectations.\n\nAdvantages of booking a planner also include maximising the return from whatever budget you have and the elimination of any stress, allowing you to really enjoy the build up to your wedding... How it should be!\n\nKind Words\n\n\"Work hard in silence. Let success be your noise\"\n\nThank you so much for all your dedication to our Vow Renewal. It was so very very special. Attention to detail second to none. Thank you!\n\nNicole and Jason Dickson, Sept 2018\n\nCheryl and Lucy are professional and creative wedding planners with great ideas, insight, opinions and vendor contacts that made our special day such a dream. They ensured we got the wedding day we envisaged, and all this done with a calmness and confidence that left us free to just enjoy the day. I highly recommend their services!\n\nLorraine and Tharanga Walpita, Mar 2018\n\nThank you very much for your great and hard work! We had the perfect day and we have very fond memories of the \"mastermind\" of our wedding. Fantastic Job!\n\nAndreas and Kirsten John, Sept 2017\n\nA big thank you for all your hard work. It was just a wonderful day. The guests were amazed and they enjoyed every minute. Could not have done it without you.\n\nElizabeth and Kristian Whitaker, Aug 2017\n\nI wanted to tell you that you did such an incredible job!\n\nYou advised and helped us every step of the way. We have nothing but amazing memories of not only the entire weekend, but our working relationship with you. Love you!\n\nAshley and Stuart Petrie, May 2016\n\nThank you for being particularly amazing! Everything went so smooth over the 4 days! It was absolutely perfect! Better than I could have dreamed of!\n\nBlake and Jaime Rogers, Aug 2015\n\nWe'd recommend you a million times over! Such attention to detail!\n\nVinay and Neetu Sharma, July 2015\n\nYour attention to detail, diligence and enthusiasm is second to none. Thank you so much for making our dream wedding a reality!\n\nS & J Willis, Sept 2014\n\nBeyond perfect! You got our vision and played it out!\n\nNiall and Amber Sinclair, Aug 2014\n\nOur wedding was just so incredible! I am at a loss for words that truly express it. The entire day was everything we wanted! Thank you so much for helping us, we could not have done it without you. You are indeed a real gem!\n\nMr and Mrs W Langbehn, Aug 2013\n\nWe are still on a high! The wedding weekend was amazing and it was all down to your planning and execution! We cannot thank you enough!\n\nSandra and Iain Millership, Aug 2013\n\nCheryl and Lucy, my wedding angels! Our wedding was enchanted, all our relatives left feeling like they’d lived a truly unique once in a lifetime experience. It was your management that made this all happen!\n\nLarissa and Fernando Leira, Jul 2013\n\nNot only was your planning and delivery exceptional but the personal touch from start to finish, was unforgettable- full of warmth with a “can do attitude”. Our wedding day was perfection!\n\nPam and Ashok Bains, Dec 2012\n\nWords fail us in trying to express or gratitude for everything you’ve done for us. We feel totally blessed for having you there to help and support us on our wedding journey. The communication was excellent and we always felt Cheryl and Lucy had things “in hand”. This was very reassuring. The immaculate organisation of everything as well as hard work and dedication resulted in the most wonderful experience, better than we could ever have imagined.\n\nMinni and Robert Lockhart, June 2012\n\nWhat can we say apart from thank you! Your absolutely professional and fantastic work left us stunned!! Our dreams came true!\n\nJudit and Eduardo Sanchez, Nov 2011\n\nThank you so much for delivering the wedding of our dreams!\n\nHarneen and Amrit Dhillon, Jul 2011\n\n\"We were a bit nervous about strangers taking care of the coordination of our wedding, in a city that was foreign to us. However, we needn't have worried as Cheryl and Lucy immediately put our minds at ease. Our wedding was more than we had ever dreamed it would be! We had a beautiful, stress-free ceremony and vacation in the Highlands, thanks to Premier Wedding Planners Scotland. The girls really hit the note as regards suggestions for our venue, accommodation, flowers\n\nand photography. We would recommend them a thousand times over!\"\n\nKen and Millie Stanford, Feb 2011\n\nWe can't thank you enough for all your hard work! We were reluctant to hire a wedding planner, but after going deep into the matter we soon found out it was the best decision we could have made! There are so many things we would never have thought of! Our wedding turned out to be a bigger project than we ever imagined and we can’t thank you enough for taking all that work from us. Thinking back, pre, during and post wedding, we don’t think there was anything you could have done better. We called you our \"good fairy\", as you made our day perfect! We wish you were in our everyday lives to get us organised! Organising a wedding is a job on its own. Unless you want it to be your only job, get professionals- get Cheryl and Lucy!\n\nMaja and Steven Stirrat, Sept 2010"
