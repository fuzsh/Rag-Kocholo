Smooth Radio in Glasgow has raised £32,000 for its chosen station charity – Marie Curie's Big Build Appeal.

The station held its annual fundraising day last Wednesday in aid of the charity and say it's the biggest amount raised so far.

Businesses across Glasgow and the West signed up to take part, with items being auctioned on-air all day, including an ultimate room make-over and a seven-night holiday to Majorca.

Gerry Burke, Head of Presentation for Smooth Radio said, “I’m beyond delighted with what the team achieved on Big Wednesday. Our target was £30,000 and to beat it, especially in the current economic climate is just fantastic.

"I have to say a big thank you to Smooth Radio listeners for taking the time to bid on auction items, donate money and fundraise, every penny is much appreciated."
