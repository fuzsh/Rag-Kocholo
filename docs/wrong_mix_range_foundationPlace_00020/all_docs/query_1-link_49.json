        "text": "In February 2023, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is likely to propose a rule that would require certain facilities that emit ethylene oxide (EtO) to reduce those emissions (Reed 2022). This flammable, colorless gas is used largely to sterilize medical devices, as well as some plastics and packaged spices. It is also used to make chemicals for manufacturing antifreeze and other products. Despite its wide usage, the EPA, National Toxicology Program, and International Association of Research on Cancer all classify EtO as a carcinogen, a substance that can cause cancer (NCEA 2016, NTP 2021, IARC 2012).\n\nIn effect, the very product used to sterilize critical medical equipment also endangers people who live, work, or attend school near these facilities. Chronic exposure through inhaling EtO is associated with the development of cancers of white blood cells, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as breast cancer in women. Children are particularly vulnerable: their bodies experience frequent cell divisions as they grow, and they are susceptible to DNA mutations caused by EtO exposure. Acute inhalation of EtO can also contribute to respiratory issues, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue (EPA, n.d.a).\n\nThe EPA's forthcoming rule will affect only commercial sterilizers, which use EtO to sterilize medical devices, spices, and other products. In 2020, the EPA updated emissions standards for facilities regulated under a source category1 known as \"Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing\" or MON (EPA 2022a; EPA 2022b). MON facilities can emit EtO (and several other hazardous air pollutants) as a byproduct of producing chemicals used to make solvents, plastics, and pesticides. In December 2022, the EPA affirmed its decision to adopt stronger EtO emissions standards from MON facilities; however, the agency has yet to close emissions loopholes and require fenceline monitoring at these facilities (Earthjustice 2022).\n\nHowever, commercial sterilizers and MON facilities are just two of several types of facilities that emit EtOâ€”a piece of the puzzle of air toxics that contribute to pollution in communities. Hundreds of facilities in a variety of chemical sectors nationwide emit EtO. For example, two Union Carbide facilities less than five miles apart in Institute and South Charleston, West Virginia, do so (WVDEP, n.d.). But because EtO emissions are regulated under different source categories, stronger emissions requirements for one facility may not apply to the other. This piecemeal, convoluted approach to regulating hazardous air pollutants leaves communities in the dark and continuously exposed to this toxic gas.\n\nThe EPA's decision to consider requiring facilities to reduce EtO emissions comes after decades of communities and workers shouldering the burden of harmful exposure. For example, Clean Power Lake County has fought to limit EtO emissions from the Medline Industries commercial sterilizer in Waukegan, Illinois (Clean Power Lake County, n.d.). The community where the facility is located has a high concentration of Latino and low-income residents. Or take Allentown, Pennsylvania: more than 30 residents have sued the B. Braun commercial sterilizer facility, charging that its EtO emissions are responsible for elevated cancer rates (Pradelli and Mettendorf 2022). This community also has a higher proportion of people of color, people with low incomes, and people with limited English language proficiency compared with the county overall. And in Geismar, Louisiana, the BASF chemical plant (regulated as a MON source category) is one of 13 plants producing EtO in the state's so-called \"Cancer Alley\" (Parker and Russell 2021). According to a ProPublica analysis, BASF is one of the nation's top five corporations for cancer-causing air emissions (Younes et al. 2021).\n\nCommunity members and workers should not have to carry the burden of ensuring that facilities control cancer-causing air emissions. Indeed, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to update emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants every eight years. However, the EPA, which was due to update its commercial sterilizer rule in 2014, is now nine years overdue on doing so (OIG 2021). Moreover, it has been seven years since the EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)2 program updated its risk assessment for EtO inhalation, determining that the chemical is a carcinogen (NCEA 2016). And in 2022, after assessing risks to communities near active commercial sterilizers, the EPA found an elevated cancer risk in 23 communities (EPA 2022c). In these communities, the maximum cancer risk level from EtO emissions exceeds the EPA's threshold of 100 additional cancer cases per 1 million people.3\n\nThat said, the concept of \"acceptable risk\" must be questioned when people's lives are at stake. The EPA's assessments of EtO from commercial sterilizers do not consider exposure to other chemicals or pollutants that may be in a community. Nor do they consider other cumulative impacts, such as poverty, that can increase susceptibility to poor health outcomes. And even communities adjacent to facilities not identified in the EPA's assessment or that fall below the agency's risk threshold may still face elevated cancer risks due to EtO emissions. Thus, the EPA's risk estimates likely underestimate the cancer risk for communities near these facilities. Moreover, while the EPA has identified facilities that emit EtO, who lives near these facilities has been less clear. Nor has the agency completed an equity analysis to identify possible environmental injustices.\n\nTo understand who EtO emissions from commercial sterilizers and MON facilities4 most endanger, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has analyzed emissions and enforcement data for 104 facilities, as well as sociodemographic characteristics of the communities surrounding these facilities. Our analysis, covering US states and Puerto Rico, includes 96 commercial sterilizers that the forthcoming rule may affect, as well as another eight facilities with MON-related EtO emissions (EPA 2022d; EPA 2019). The methodology for this analysis can be found at the end of this document.\n\nFigure 1: More than 14 million people live within five miles of the 104 ethylene oxide-emitting facilities shown here. Many are people of color, people with low incomes, and/or people with limited English language proficiency.\n\nThe UCS analysis also identified EtO \"sterilizer hotspots\"â€”communities within five miles of two or more commercial sterilizers (in other words, two or more sterilizers that are less than 10 miles apart). We found that 28 percent of commercial sterilizers are in hotspots, potentially exposing people to multiple EtO sources (Table 1). Note that this finding does not include other EtO-emitting facilities that may be in those communities.\n\nLiving in a sterilizer hotspot does not mean that a person is absolutely exposed to hazardous levels of EtO, but someone could be exposed to EtO from multiple facilities. Nevertheless, the EPA does not account for these cumulative exposures. Three hotspots with multiple commercial sterilizers are home to facilities identified by the EPA as having an elevated cancer risk from EtO emissions: in Denver, Colorado; Hanover-Jessup, Maryland; and Richmond, Virginia.\n\nSeveral facilities may be violating the Clean Air Act. According to the UCS analysis, eight of the 46 commercial sterilizers identified by the EPA as contributing to elevated cancer risks, in hotspots, or both have been in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act at least once during the last 12 quarters or been subject to informal or formal EPA enforcement actions in the last five years (Table 1).\n\nUnfortunately, penalties for violating the Clean Air Act too often represent a small cost of doing business. For example, the Sterigenics facility in Charlotte, North Carolina, paid $11,500 in penalties in 2020 for a Clean Air Act violation, a drop in the bucket for a company that reported more than $931.5 million in total net revenues in 2021 (ECHO 2020; SEC 2021).\n\nCommunities near EtO-Emitting Commercial Sterilizers and MON Facilities Face Elevated Cancer Risks\n\nThe UCS analysis found that communities adjacent to commercial sterilizers and EtO-emitting MON facilities are exposed to above-average cancer risks from toxic air pollutants. According to the EPA's AirToxScreen 2018,5 Americans face an average cancer risk of 20 additional cases per 1 million people if they breathe air toxics based on 2018 emissions levels for 70 years (EPA, n.d.c). This estimate incorporates most Clean Air Act--regulated air toxics, including EtO.\n\nAccording to the UCS analysis, the average cancer risk from air toxics in the census tracts where these 104 facilities are located is nearly 60 additional cancer cases per 1 million peopleâ€”nearly three times the national average (AirToxScreen 2022). Furthermore, EtO emissions contribute to roughly one-third of the total cancer risk in these census tracts, representing a significant portion of cancer risk among 138 air toxics included in AirToxScreen (EPA, n.d.c). The overall air toxics cancer risk in the census tracts where these facilities are located ranges from 10 to 400 additional cancer cases per 1 million.\n\nFifteen facilities are in census tracts with a total air toxics cancer risk of at least 100 per 1 million, which is the EPA's threshold for acceptable risk. These facilities are in Arizona (two), Florida (one), Georgia (two), Louisiana (one), Missouri (one), Puerto Rico (two), Tennessee (one), and Texas (five).\n\nCommercial Sterilizers and EtO-Emitting MON Facilities Are Disproportionately Located in Underserved Communities\n\nExposure to EtO is an urgent environmental justice issue. UCS has estimated the total number of people living within five miles of each facility, including the proportion of people of color, low-income residents, and people with limited English language proficiency. Of the roughly 14.2 million people living within five miles of at least one facility, nearly 8.5 million identify as people of color; 4.8 million identify as people with low incomes, and 1.2 million identify as people with limited English language proficiency (Table 2).\n\nCompared with the counties in which the facilities are located, 57 commercial sterilizers (59 percent) are in communities with a higher proportion of people of color; 41 (43 percent) are located in communities with a higher proportion of people with low incomes; and 24 (25 percent) are in communities with a higher proportion of people with limited English language proficiency. Of the eight facilities with MON-related EtO emissions, five are in communities with a higher proportion of people of color compared with the county averages. For 16 commercial sterilizers and two MON facilities, the proportion of people of color, people with low incomes, and people with limited English language proficiency are all greater than the average for the counties in which the facilities are located.\n\nThese differences are even more pronounced when compared with the nation overall. Twenty-seven commercial sterilizers and two MON facilities (28 percent of facilities included in this analysis) are in communities with a higher proportion of people of color, people with low incomes, and people with limited English language proficiency compared with the US average. Indeed, on average, commercial sterilizers and EtO-emitting MON facilities appear to be concentrated in communities and counties with a higher proportion of people of color, people with low incomes, and people with limited English language proficiency compared with the United States overall (Table 2).\n\nOur findings align with those of an EPA Inspector General's 2021 report. It stated that \"minorities or [people] part of low-income households\" comprise more than half of the people living in census block groups of 14 (of 22) EtO-emitting facilities contributing to elevated cancer risks (OIG 2021).\n\nThe UCS analysis substantiates earlier analyses that communities of color are treated as sacrifice zones for toxic pollution (Lerner 2010). Nearly 62 percent (64) of commercial sterilizers and facilities with MON-related EtO emissions are in communities where the proportion of people of color is greater than the US average.\n\nThese disproportionate impacts are particularly stark in sterilizer hotspots. Seventeen of the 27 sterilizers (63 percent) in hotspots have a greater proportion of people of color within five miles compared with county averages. On average, the proportion of people of color within five miles of these facilities in hotspots is nearly 10 percent greater than communities within five miles of sterilizers in non-hotspot areas. Multiple commercial sterilizers and other polluting facilities may expose the communities in these hotspots to harmful EtO emissions. Furthermore, more than half (13) of the 23 commercial sterilizers contributing to excess cancer risk from EtO emissions are in communities with a higher proportion of people of color compared with county averages.\n\nIndeed, communities of color face higher cancer risks from air toxics overall. Among the facilities in communities with a higher proportion of people of color than the US average (40 percent), the average air toxics cancer risk is nearly 70 cases per millionâ€”which is 17 percent greater than the average for census tracts with commercial sterilizers and EtO-emitting MON facilities overall. And finally, among the facilities in our analysis, 15 (12 commercial sterilizers and 3 MON facilities) have been found to be in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act in at least one of the last 12 quarters. Ten are in communities with a higher proportion of people of color than the US average.\n\nIn sum, race is a key indicator of exposure to ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizers and MON facilities. People of color are disproportionately exposed to EtO emissions, face elevated cancer risks, and are in communities that are more likely to have multiple commercial sterilizers and facilities that fail to comply with the Clean Air Act.\n\nGoing Deeper: 10 Case Studies\n\nUCS looked deeper into communities in nine states and Puerto Rico that may be disproportionately burdened by EtO emissions from commercial sterilizers and MON facilities. Our analysis considered the results within buffer zones around each facility of one mile (red in the maps), three miles (orange), and five miles (yellow). We retrieved data on facility noncompliance and EtO emissions from the EPA's ECHO database.6\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia has 15 commercial sterilizers, and more than 4.8 million Californians (roughly 12 percent of the state population) live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (US Census Bureau 2020). Nine of these facilities are located in metropolitan Los Angeles. See more here.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado has four commercial sterilizers. More than 592,000 Coloradans live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (roughly 10 percent of the state population) (US Census Bureau 2020). Two of the metropolitan Denver sterilizersâ€”Terumo BCT in Lakewood and Livanova in Arvadaâ€”are a hotspot roughly five miles apart. See more here.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia has five commercial sterilizers. More than 412,000 Georgians (roughly 4 percent of the state population) live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (US Census Bureau 2020). Two facilities in Atlantaâ€”Sterigenics and Sterilization Services of Georgiaâ€”are less than 10 miles apart. See more here.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland has four commercial sterilizers. More than 343,000 Marylanders live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (nearly 6 percent of the state population) (US Census Bureau 2020). The two sterilizers in metropolitan Baltimore, in Hanover and Jessup, are roughly three miles apart. See more on here.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAll six of Minnesota's commercial sterilizers are in metropolitan Minneapolis-St. Paul (Figure 6). Nearly 842,000 Minnesotans (nearly 15 percent of the state population) live within five miles at least one of these facilities (US Census Bureau 2020). See more here.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey has three commercial sterilizers. More than 716,000 New Jersey residents (roughly 8 percent of the state population) live within five miles of them (US Census Bureau 2020). In metropolitan New York City, just over the border in New Jersey, two sterilizers are roughly 12 miles apartâ€”EtO Sterilization in Linden and Steris Isomedix in South Plainfield. See more here.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nThe commonwealth of Puerto Rico bears a disproportionate burden of EtO pollution from commercial sterilizers. Only California and Texas, the two most populous states, have more sterilizers, even though Puerto Rico has roughly one-tenth the population of Texas and 1 percent of its land area. Puerto Rico has seven commercial sterilizers. The EPA has identified four as contributing to elevated cancer risks. In all, the seven sterilizers are within five miles of more than 413,000 Puerto Ricans (roughly 13 percent of the commonwealth's population) and nearly 300 schools and childcare centers (US Census Bureau 2020). Puerto Rico has a very high proportion of Latino residents, with people of color making up 99 percent of the population within five miles of these sterilizers.8\n\nSee more here.\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee has two commercial sterilizer facilities, Sterilization Services of Tennessee in Memphis and DeRoyal Industries/Royal Sterilization in New Tazewell. Both sterilize medical equipment and nearly 141,000 Tennesseans (roughly 2 percent of the state population) live within five miles of them (US Census Bureau 2020). Organizers from Memphis Community Against Pollution have been pushing federal and local officials to hold the facility accountable and protect public health (MCAP, n.d.). See more here.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas has eight commercial sterilizers and one facility with MON-related EtO emissions. More than 1.1 million Texans (roughly 4 percent of the state population) live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (US Census Bureau 2020). Two sterilizersâ€”Sterigenics and Cosmed of Texasâ€”are less than a mile apart in Grand Prairie, between Dallas and Fort Worth. See more here.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia has four commercial sterilizers, two in metropolitan Richmond and two in Virginia Beach. Both areas are sterilizer hotspots. Nearly 726,000 Virginians (more than 8 percent of the state population) live within five miles of at least one of these facilities (US Census Bureau 2020). In Richmond, Sterilization Services of Virginia in Henrico and Central Virginia Health Network/Bon Secours Mercy Health are located less than 10 miles apart. See more here.\n\nMethodology\n\nData Sources\n\nThe analysis included 104 Commercial Sterilizer and Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing (MON) facilities total.\n\nData for commercial sterilizers were gathered from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) webpage of Ethylene Oxide Commercial Sterilization Facilities (EPA 2022a). Twenty-three of these commercial sterilizers were also identified as contributing to elevated cancer risk by EPA risk assessments in 2022 (EPA 2022b). Information about these facilities, including lifetime cancer risk estimates attributable to ethylene oxide emissions, were provided on individual webpages for each facility, accessed on November 25, 2022. EPA's threshold for \"elevated\" cancer risk is that which exceeds 100 additional cancer cases per 1 million people, assuming 24 hours of exposure over a 70-year lifetime (EPA 2022b). These risk estimates were based solely on ethylene oxide emissions from each facility and do not consider other exposures or stressors that may impact one's risk of developing cancer. Data for MON facilities were drawn from Appendix 10 of the EPA's 2019 \"Residual Risk Assessment for the Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Source Category\" (EPA 2019).\n\nLocation coordinates, compliance, enforcement, and emissions data for each facility were gathered from the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database, accessed on November 25, 2022 (ECHO, n.d.). It is important to note that the ECHO database is inconsistently updated and is missing data. We were unable to locate 19 facilities in ECHO, and 72 facility pages (nearly 70 percent) did not include ethylene oxide releases and transfers data for 2021.\n\nUS population data, as well as data on people of color, people with low income, and people with limited English language proficiency were gathered from the US Census Bureau, 2016-2020 American Community Survey, 5-Year Estimates. \"People of color\" was defined as the population that did not identify as \"White Alone, Not Hispanic or Latino\" (the variable value was subtracted from the total population). \"People with low income\" was defined as the population living below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. \"People with limited English language proficiency\" was defined as the population that identifies as speaking English \"not well\" or \"not at all.\"\n\nThe number of \"schools\" includes both public and private schools. Data on public and private schools and childcare centers were gathered from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Geoplatform (DHS 2022).\n\nAirToxScreen data were gathered from EPA's AirToxScreen 2018, which was the latest version available at the time of the analysis (EPA 2022c). The EPA's AirToxScreen database integrates emissions, ambient concentrations, and exposure estimates for 181 of the 189 Clean Air Act air toxics, plus diesel particulate matter. Cancer risks are included for nearly 140 of these. According to the EPA, AirToxScreen \"helps assess which air toxics and emission source types may pose health risks\" (EPA 2022c).\n\nIdentifying Impacted Communities and Cancer Risks\n\nThe facilities were mapped as points in ArcGIS using geographic coordinates. For each point, the one-, three-, and five-mile buffer circles were added. While the distance that gases can travel from a facility will vary greatly based on weather, geography, and other factorsâ€”and ethylene oxide emissions will generally most impact those living on the fenceline or working in these facilitiesâ€”we selected the five-mile buffer around each facility as the study area because the EPA's 2022 risk assessment of 23 commercial sterilizers demonstrated elevated cancer risks more than four miles away from some facilities.\n\nAny facility with a buffer area that overlapped with the buffer of another facility was deemed a \"hotspot.\" Hotspots are areas where a facility is 10 or fewer miles from at least one other facility. Communities between facilities in a hotspot may be exposed to higher levels of ethylene oxide. In this analysis, all hotspots included commercial sterilizers only.\n\nFor each facility, we estimated the population; number of schools (public and private) and childcare centers; and number of people of color, people with low income, and people with limited English language proficiency within the five-mile buffers. These estimates were determined in R-4.2.2, where each facility was geolocated in space and a 5-mile radius was drawn around the point using the sf package. A fraction of the area of the circles within each geography (block group, tract, county, and state) was calculated using the tigris package. Next, the census variable and total population counts or estimates for each geography were extracted using the tidycensus package. The final \"buffer population\" for the census variables was estimated by multiplying the census geography population by the fraction of the facility buffer area compared to the area of the total census geography. If the buffer overlapped more than one census geography, these population estimates were summed to reflect the whole buffer.\n\nTo understand whether there were local and regional disparities in who is most impacted by ethylene oxide pollution, we compared the sociodemographic data within five miles of each facility to county averages. To calculate county averages, the population estimates for total geographies were extracted as described above. If a buffer overlapped more than one county, a mean was calculated for the population estimates for each overlapped county.\n\nFor each facility, the proportion of people of color, people with low income, and people with limited English language proficiency within the five-mile buffer were compared with the county averages. The proportion within the five-mile buffer was only deemed greater than the county average if there was a 1 percent or greater difference.\n\nTo determine the estimated air toxics cancer risk attributable to ethylene oxide, we divided the \"Ethylene Oxide Risk\" by the \"Total Risk\" for each census tract where the facilities are located. Note that AirToxScreen assumes that \"exposures to multiple carcinogens can be added together to estimate risks\" (EPA 2022d). According to the EPA, \"This approach has drawbacks: Effects from multiple chemicals may be greater or less than additive, and statistical limitations exist. But this straightforward calculation is widely used to estimate cumulative risks\" (EPA 2022d). While this approach may not fully capture the synergistic interactions between chemicals, it provides an estimate of ethylene oxide's contribution to the total cancer risk from nearly 140 air toxics. In the StoryMap, we included the estimated air toxics cancer risk attributable to ethylene oxide if it exceeded 10 percent. If it is not provided, it means that ethylene oxide is estimated to contribute to less than 10 percent of the overall air toxics cancer risk in the census tract where the facility is located. Finally, while the EPA has not yet released a Technical Support Document for AirToxScreen 2018, the map indicates that ethylene oxide risks have decreased since 2018 due to emissions controls; however, at the time of this analysis, AirToxScreen 2018 was the latest version available."
