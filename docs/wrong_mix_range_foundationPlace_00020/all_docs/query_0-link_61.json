        "text": "At the elementary school level, additional skills and developmental topics build on the core skill set to broaden the student’s sense of self-efficacy and confidence.

These additional concepts include:\n\nManaging Mistakes and Disappointment\n\nResisting Peer Pressure\n\nUnderstanding Peer Influence\n\nMaking Healthy Choices\n\nSubstance use and its effect on the body are introduced when developmentally appropriate.

Students set and reach more complex goals and, in the process, develop and practice stronger decision-making skills and effective-communication skills.\n\nStudents also learn to identify and manage their emotions and the emotions of others so they can better relate to others and seek to associate with positive peer groups. Too Good for Drugs addresses environmental and developmental risk factors related to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs through the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes teens need to make healthy decisions consistent with their healthy goals.\n\nSubstance use topics are discussed in the context of expectations, peer pressure and influence, and the role of the media. In particular, more complex social challenges and influences that present a greater risk for escapism and risky behavior are explored and met with strategies for managing those situations in a positive and healthy way.\n\nInteractive games and activities create an experiential learning environment so students can learn and apply the skills in the classroom setting.\n\nAdditional skills and developmental topics build on the core social skill set to broaden the student’s sense of self-efficacy and confidence and are tailored to the intellectual, cognitive, and social development of the student.\n\nMedia Literacy and Media Influence\n\nResisting Peer Pressure\n\nUnderstanding Peer Influence\n\nUnderstanding Addiction\n\nComplex Social and Dating Relationships\n\nExploring Risk Taking and Differentiating Healthy and Unhealthy Risks\n\nSubstance use and its effects on the body are introduced when developmentally appropriate. More complex discussions are introduced at the Middle School level and progress in depth as the students mature.\n\nSafe Use of Prescription and OTC drugs\n\nEffects of Nicotine Use including ENDS\n\nEffects of Alcohol Use\n\nEffects of Marijuana and THC Use\n\nEffects of Street Drugs including Opioids and Stimulants\n\nToo Good for Drugs in High School applies real world challenges teens face in high school to explore practical guidance for understanding the negative health effects related to prescription drug misuse, underage drinking, marijuana abuse, opioid abuse, and nicotine use. Students also explore the stages of addiction and the risks associated with experimentation.\n\nSkill development is at the core of Too Good to promote social awareness and self-awareness to equip teens to evaluate the social and peer influences they face as well as the internal pressures to take unhealthy risks to fit in with their peers or to escape. Interactive activities challenge students to explore healthy alternatives to unhealthy risks as they work to reach their goals.\n\nAdditional skills and developmental topics build on the core social skill set to broaden the student’s sense of self-efficacy and confidence and are tailored to the intellectual, cognitive, and social development of the student.\n\nMedia Literacy and Media Influence\n\nResisting Peer Pressure\n\nUnderstanding Peer Influence\n\nUnderstanding Addiction\n\nComplex Social and Dating Relationships\n\nExploring Risk Taking and Differentiating Healthy and Unhealthy Risks\n\nSubstance use and its effect on the body are introduced through more complex discussions around the effect of substance use on health, life, academic, and career goals.\n\nSafe Use of Prescription and OTC drugs\n\nEffects of Nicotine Use including ENDS\n\nEffects of Alcohol Use\n\nEffects of Marijuana and THC Use\n\nEffects of Street Drugs including Opioids and Stimulants\n\nToo Good for Drugs & Violence High School\n\nTGFD&V combines the Violence prevention and Substance Abuse prevention components of Too Good for Drugs with the additional interpersonal skills, conflict resolution, and problem solving skill development of Too Good for Violence - Social Perspectives into one seamless 15 lesson course.\n\nThese additional concepts include:\n\nRespect for Self and for Others\n\nConflict Resolution\n\nAnger Management\n\nHealthy Teen Dating\n\nSocial Media Awareness\n\nLearn More"
