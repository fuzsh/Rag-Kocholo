        "text": "Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Athena, Kristin, and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy husband and I have a rocky marriage. I am in therapy trying to work out staying with someone who is a great dad but very moody and carries far less than his household share. But today it got worse when he came to me with a confession.\n\nHe racked up over $1,000 in debt from online gambling. This is enough money to make things financially stressful for us. He only came clean because I asked for access to the credit card he was using. This information wasn’t offered voluntarily. Even though he said he had quit, his last bet for $100 was two days ago. It’s not only the money, it’s the lying and lack of trust. Who knows what secrets could come next? Is it worth taking steps out of the marriage?\n\n—Lost the Bet\n\nDear Lost the Bet,\n\nAt the very minimum, the two of you should be dealing with this in couples therapy. Gambling, hiding debt, lying—it’s hard to work through these problems on your own, especially in a marriage that’s already rocky. There’s a good chance the problems you’re experiencing in your marriage might overlap with his behavior. He might have kept this debt secret because he was afraid to make things between the two of you worse, for example. Don’t get me wrong: He is responsible for his behavior and lying in a marriage can completely erode the foundation of trust. But that’s all the more reason why you’re going to need the help of a professional to work through this.\n\nAssuming both of you want to stay in the marriage (or at least give it one last shot) commit to working on this together. Try to look at the situation not as you versus him, but as the both of you versus this unwieldy problem. The actual work will take some time and effort, and having a third party to help with this will be crucial. You need someone who can look at the situation objectively and give you feedback, tools, and a roadmap for moving forward. Whether or not you want to endure this work is up to you, but if you decide to stick it out, bring in some outside help.\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nI have a younger sister. She constantly borrows money from people and often doesn’t pay it back. She quit a good job years ago because she didn’t like the stress, and things got worse. We’re about eight years apart and are both over the age of 50. We used to be fairly close but, partially because of her borrowing habit, we are no longer as close as she’d like. My husband and I make a good living, but she doesn’t know that. Our other sister is very good at saving and has given more than I have. Younger sis even “borrowed” money from our 90-year-old mother’s bank account until all of my mom’s money had to go to an assisted-living facility. In the fall of last year, my brother fell ill and was no longer able to care for his pit bull. My sister took the dog and felt that our other sister and I should help chip in when she took it to the vet to get spayed. We agreed to send the money directly to the provider, but she never followed up. Eventually, a wealthy friend of hers took care of the vet bill. After that, Sis declared, “I’m never gonna ask to borrow money again, since that was such a big deal.” Given the fact she doesn’t pay it back, her declaration was a ludicrous statement.\n\nOf course, that policy didn’t mean she wouldn’t continue to ask for handouts. My brother passed away about a week ago and she immediately wanted to charge some items for the dog to his debit card. I told her I didn’t think that was a good idea, so she took offense and said, “Well, do you wanna pay for it?” in a rude manner. She also declared how upset she was that she could no longer buy a car because our brother wouldn’t be able to pay her rent money. (They were living together.)\n\nThe only way I can see my relationship with her improving is by having a serious talk about how borrowing money as a lifestyle is not acceptable. She now works at a prestigious institution—it’s the same place she left earlier but in a different position. I don’t know her salary, but surely it should be enough to let her take care of herself. When I mentioned a budget several times, she found that offensive, too. She drinks a lot and I know a lot of her income goes toward that. How can I broach the subject without making things worse?\n\n—Sick of Slack Sister\n\nDear Sick of Sister,\n\nIt’s hard to help people who aren’t asking for help. Before approaching your younger sister, talk to your other sister about the situation. Does she see things the same way? It might help to get her input. Does she have any ideas for how to best start the conversation?\n\nIt’s worth pointing out here: Your younger sister may still be grieving in her own way. Yes, her irresponsible financial behavior predates the loss of your brother. But grief has a way of making everything more difficult, and if she and your brother lived together, his absence might be causing her a lot of pain—not only because she lost a brother, but also because her daily routine is totally different. All of this is to say, it’s a tough time for all of you. Take that into consideration.\n\nThink about approaching the conversation in three parts. Part one: listen. Ask her where she’s at lately: mentally, emotionally, and financially. How is she handling the grief? Share with her how you’re coping with it. If you can connect with her emotionally before bringing up her finances, there’s a better chance it will go smoothly. Tell her you know that things have been tense for her money-wise and you want to make sure she’s OK. Why is she struggling so much? Maybe her job doesn’t pay as well as you thought. Or maybe this drinking problem is worse than you thought.\n\nSecond, set some boundaries. Decide on what those will be before you talk. Maybe you’ll tell her you don’t want her to ask you for money anymore, which is fair and straightforward. Think about what you’ll do if she does continue to ask: end the conversation, walk away, or go home early are all ways to disengage. Or, maybe your boundary is that if she does ask for money, she has to agree to draft a budget with you. Ultimately, she’s responsible for her finances, but if she keeps hitting you up for cash, you can make it part of the deal that she gets her finances in order.\n\nWhich brings me to the third part of the conversation: How can you help? It seems to be a given that your sister isn’t asking for a loan, she just wants financial help. You can tell her you’re willing to offer that help, but it will come in the form of talking through her finances and helping her draft a budget rather than a cash gift. Or helping her find a financial planner or research debt payoff. Whatever her scenario, if you approach the conversation from a place of care, it will be much easier to get a read on her behavior, what’s causing it, and how to correct it. If you want to have a relationship with your sister, and her financial issues continue to bug you as much as it does, you’ll need to get to the bottom of this. And that means giving her a chance to explain her situation, set some boundaries, and offer alternative forms of help.\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nI’m one of the many TV writers being affected by the entertainment industry’s current contraction period after surviving spending half of last year on strike. I have ongoing produced projects (they’re just not currently paying me) and solid connections, so I have no intention of leaving the industry at this time—it’s still absolutely in my best interest to hang in. But I don’t enjoy watching my hard-earned savings deplete in the meantime! I’m looking for advice on how to supplement my income when I’m only available for part-time work—work I’ll have to leave as soon as a writing job comes my way again.\n\nGoogling “side hustles” is overwhelming. I have a BFA and plenty of admin experience, though I’m over 40 and extremely reluctant to go back to temp assistant work, especially in the industry I work in as a professional writer (awkward). Any advice on what kind of work I should seek out to get through this rough time when I’ve spent the last 20 years focused on developing this very specific set of creative skills? Especially something that I can build on for future rough times (I’m a realist, and I’ve chosen an extremely competitive profession!). Thank you for any advice you may have!\n\n—It’s Hard Out There for a Writer\n\nDear Writer,\n\nIt’s tough out there for workers in so many different industries right now, and TV writers are no different. The future is wholly uncertain and there’s no roadmap to tell you what to do.\n\nThere are a handful of options for side hustling outside of your skillset —ride-sharing, dog walking a part-time job— but if you can monetize your creative skills, why not? Teaching in some form or another could be a relatively straightforward way to earn a little extra income. You could do this through a local university’s continuing education program or a community writing center—or you could just do it on your own. You could reach out to your network and social media community to see if anyone might be interested in signing up for some kind of writing class. There may be other writers willing to pay for a screenwriting consultation, a course on pitching ideas to producers, adapting their novels for screen, and so on. All of this might require a little research on personal branding, but you already have your TV credentials working for you. You’ve found success in an extremely competitive industry, which means you have some skills and experience that many folks would love to learn. Why not monetize that?\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy boyfriend’s ex-wife is 47 years old. Two years after their divorce, she went through the settlement money and her spousal support is over. She can’t afford to maintain her household expenses, and she’s asking my partner for help. He wants to help her because he says he wants his daughter to have a stable place to stay when she is with her mom. I feel like he’s having a hard time letting go of control and that he likes that his ex needs him. She has no job experience or formal education, so there’s an unlikely possibility that she’ll be able to find a job to support herself. Years ago, she left him for another man, who she is still with and dependent on her for money. But that man is older, in poor health, and on disability. Should I accept that he will always financially support her? What should I do?\n\n—Unsure In Atlanta\n\nDear Unsure,\n\nI understand your partner wants to support his daughter, but it also sounds like you need to discuss his finnacial support and the shape it will take in the future.\n\nOne factor that might be important here: Are your finances combined or separate? If you both have totally separate financial accounts and budgets, this might be less of an issue. But if you combine your finances in any way — or have plans to do so — you should definitely have a say in this. If your partner insists that he needs to offer his ex financial support, talk about what that looks like. What expenses, specifically, would benefit their daughter? This might be housing. It might be the cost of education or childcare. Whatever it is, he should be specific. He should have a hard rule in place for what and how much he’ll pay each month. Otherwise, things can quickly get out of hand.\n\nMost importantly, you need to be looped into this discussion. You should both talk about this before he brings any stipulations to his ex. If it really is about him controlling the situation, he might push back, and then you can bring up that concern. But if it’s truly about making sure his daughter has a stable environment, decide what that looks like together.\n\n—Kristin\n\nClassic Prudie"
