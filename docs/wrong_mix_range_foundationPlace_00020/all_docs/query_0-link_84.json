        "text": "The first time I visited Fisk University was during Scholar's Weekend. I saw that Fisk shared the same family atmosphere as my own family. I knew Fisk was the perfect fit for me, even during the horrible tornado that hit North Nashville in March of 2020, I was on campus and was able to see how all the incredible Fiskites band together to help out the community. Fisk not only gives you an extraordinary education but lessons that follow you past your years on campus.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced my decision to attend Fisk was the small class size because I was very particular about receiving one-on-one attention from professors (I prefer one on one tutoring). Fisk was my first choice because of the small class ratio of about 12:1, which was the lowest of the other schools I applied to. Aside from the small class size, Fisk also provided me with a full tuition scholarship. There are numerous activities in place to ensure that each student has a positive school experience and thrives here.\n\nUpon completing my matriculation through my Biology program, I plan on attending medical school and ultimately becoming a medical anesthesiologist. This ardent ambition is deeply rooted in my desire to serve as a beacon of inspiration within my community, a testament to the unwavering power of hard work and determination. With each step I take, I yearn to demonstrate to others that every goal, no matter how lofty, can be achieved through sheer dedication and perseverance.\n\nFisk's stellar academic reputation, especially in arts and sciences, and the inspiring legacy of social justice champions like John Lewis and Justin Jones, irresistibly drew me in. The university's dedicated Office of Career Planning and Development resonated with my aspirations. I'm thrilled to embark on the dual-degree nursing program at the Galen School of Nursing, working toward my dream of becoming a Registered Nurse. With Fisk's legacy as my foundation, I'm committed to a future as a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA).\n\nMy time at Fisk University has laid a solid foundation of knowledge and skills; thus, I look forward with great anticipation to the next chapter of my academic and professional journey. Upon the completion of my political science degree at Fisk University, my immediate goal is to further my academic journey by enrolling in law school. This step is pivotal in achieving my aspiration to become a civil rights attorney. Fisk stood out immediately, as it was the first institution to extend me an acceptance, merely four days after I submitted my application. This swift acknowledgment marked a significant personal milestone, symbolizing the initial steps towards independence and the advancement of my career objectives, undertaken entirely on my own volition.\n\nAs I navigate my career, I envision pursuing graduate studies to specialize in an area that captivates me within the tech landscape. I am eager to give back by assisting future Fiskites in their professional journeys, leveraging my experiences to guide them. Serving on the other side of the table, as a mentor, holds great significance to me."
