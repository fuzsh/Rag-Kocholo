While there, she was an integral part of TCM, which specialized in airing uncut and commercial free classic movies – the channel earning a Peabody in the process. She worked with Robert Osborne and Ben Mankiewicz on a daily basis, and when someone couldn’t find some information or needed to know how many Oscar nominations a film had earned, or how many husbands Elizabeth Taylor had, she was the go-to-gal.\n\nHer latest research project: All That Heaven Allows, a biography of Rock Hudson, was published by HarperCollins in December 2018, and is in production for a major motion picture. The biography was chosen by Sight and Sound as one of its top ten for 2019.\n\nCurrently she is back at TCM as a freelance researcher, and has written, directed and produced a documentary entitled Scandal: The Trial of Mary Astor, which concerns actress Mary Astor and her 1936 fight to gain custody of her daughter. The documentary premiered at the TCM Film Festival in Los Angeles in April 2018. It has since been screened at the Hollywood Heritage Museum, and been accepted as an Official Selection at both the Dallas Film Festival and the Sedona Film Festival. Scandal had its television premiere on January 6, 2020 on TCM, and is now licensed to the channel.\n\nSpeaker Series: More Atlanta History with James Ottley\n\nJanuary 20, 7 pm\n\nFree Zoom online presentation\n\nAccess link sent after registration\n\nJames Ottley is the author of two volumes on Atlanta history, titled Atlanta History for Cocktail Parties volumes 1 and II.

LeRoy Wiley Gresham was born in 1847 to an affluent slave-holding family in Macon, Georgia. After a horrific leg injury left him an invalid, the educated, inquisitive, perceptive, and exceptionally witty 12-year-old began keeping a diary in 1860–just as secession and the Civil War began tearing the country and his world apart. He continued to write even as his health deteriorated until both the war and his life ended in 1865. His unique manuscript of the demise of the Old South has been lauded by the Library of Congress as one of its premier holdings. Richard Waterhouse will lead this discussion.\n\nThe War Outside My Window offers interesting contrasts to other books about the same Civil War era that were also set in southern Georgia, such as Lamb in My Bosom by Caroline Miller and The War-Time Journal of a Georgia Girl, 1864-1865 by Eliza Frances Andrews. These books highlight differing class views of Georgia farm life and the role of slavery, and present interesting questions about the historical context of the Civil War.

Rasbach, in I Am Perhaps Dying: The Medical Backstory of Spinal Tuberculosis Hidden in the Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham.\n\nSpeaker Series: Spalding Nix, History of Georgia Painters\n\nMay 5th – 7 pm Live Zoom Event with Spalding Nix\n\nFree\n\nSpalding Nix will discuss the History of Georgia Painters, from colonial times onward, concentrating on 18th and 19th century artists and their subjects.\n\nBesides being an entertaining speaker, Spalding is a gallery owner, accredited art appraiser and advisor, attorney, and former Buckhead Heritage board member.

As a Senior Mortuary Archaeologist with New South Associates, he uses a variety of tools, some quite ordinary and some high-tech, to help determine what’s hidden underground. Older cemeteries that date to the 1800s, like the one across from Arden Road’s New Hope AME Church can have many unknowns. Some burials got wood markers that only lasted a few decades, some stones were broken up by falling trees, and some sites may have been unsanctioned. Cemetery lot lines weren’t obvious from adjacent farmland, and some graves may now be in adjacent areas. How many burials, who, and when, are Matt’s initial challenge. He maps the graves using flags and gps coordinates, and uses church records and family descendants’ histories to help identify what’s where.\n\nSurrounding Buckhead neighbors have a long history of supporting this still active African American congregation and former school that once spanned both sides of Northside Drive from Arden Road north to Moores Mill Road. One church member told us last year about growing up where Heiskell School sat; her dad was a Wender and Roberts Pharmacy motorcycle deliveryman before he went to medical school.\n\nMatt worked on Harmony Grove Cemetery on West Paces Ferry with Buckhead Heritage, and is now mapping the New Hope Cemetery through a grant from the Massey Charitable Trust. He will talk about the process and his findings at a free Buckhead Heritage Speaker Series presentation at the New Hope Sanctuary at 3012 Arden Road on March 5th.
