        "text": "HELP A STRANGER\n\n1 Help a stranger and make their day\n\nAccording to the World Giving Index 2018, 63% of people in the UK helped a stranger last year. Why not carry on the trend and hold a door open, give up your seat on the train or just smile for someone you don’t know?\n\nShare your good deeds on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n2 Teach your kids about giving\n\nGet your children involved by talking to them about the importance of giving. Giving unwanted toys to those less fortunate, smiling at someone on the street, holding doors open for people or visiting a sick relative is still charity because it warms someone's heart.\n\nStart your children's giving\n\n3 Donate blankets, gloves, coats etc.\n\nSpare a thought for those who are homeless or in temporary accommodation. Use our charity search to donate to a homeless charity near you.\n\n4 Be a bobble hat hero\n\nEncourage your children to come to school wearing their favourite bobble hat and raise money to make a difference for other young people.\n\n5 Support a toy box scheme\n\nNot every child has toys or games, so buying an extra toy for a toy box scheme such as KidsOut can go a long way to putting a smile on someone’s face.\n\nFind out more about KidsOut\n\nGIVE YOUR TIME\n\n6 Donate blood\n\nDonating blood regularly - or even as a one-off - is a great way to ensure that you're giving back to those who need it. By giving blood, every donor is contributing to a nationwide challenge to provide life-saving products whenever and wherever they are needed.\n\nFind out more and search for your nearest venue\n\n7 Volunteer your time in a soup kitchen or homeless shelter\n\nCharities really appreciate volunteers and there are likely to be organisations in your community that could use an extra pair of helping hands. It’s a great way to meet new people and develop skills to use at work or university.\n\nStart thinking about volunteering\n\n8 Take part in a charity run\n\nCompleting a charity run is a great social event which can make you feel great while helping a cause close to your heart. It also gives you an excuse to tuck into some goodies as a reward.\n\nFind out more about running for charity\n\n9 Get involved with Decembeard\n\nMen – why not ditch your routine and grow a beard for charity? You can spend the time you’d normally spend shaving to do a good deed for someone.\n\nFind out more about Decembeard\n\n10 Sell or donate your unwanted gifts\n\nIf you receive unwanted presents, why not spend some time selling them on eBay, Amazon or Gumtree and donate the proceeds to the charity of your choice. Use our charity search for inspiration.\n\nENCOURAGE OTHERS TO GIVE\n\n11 Shout loud on social media\n\nShare one of our quirky Facebook wall posts to raise awareness for a cause close to your heart. It’s a free and easy way to support a charity at any time of year.\n\nJoin us on Facebook\n\n12 Hold a fancy dress day, or a dress down day\n\nHave a dress down day, or a themed fancy dress day, at work and charge your colleagues to get involved.\n\n13 Hold a raffle for charity\n\nIf you’ve got chocolates or biscuits leftover from a party, why not raffle them – and other unwanted goodies – for charity? You can pool your money while you decide who to donate to.\n\nTell your employer about the CAF Staff Charity Fund\n\n14 Organise a charity shop Secret Santa\n\nRather than buying your annual Secret Santa present from a high street shop, agree to buy your gifts from a charity shop. Your favourite causes will benefit and you’ll receive an unusual and unique present!\n\nDon’t forget to let us know what you got!\n\n15 Encourage your employer to develop a charity partnership for 2019\n\nIf your employer isn’t already partnered with a charity, speak to your CSR or HR colleagues about getting involved. Let them know that they can contact one of our expert advisers for help.\n\nGIVE MONEY\n\n16 Support national giving days such as #givingtuesday\n\nJoin us again to celebrate all that’s good about giving. Whether you’re an individual, a company or a charity, there are plenty of ways to get involved in national events throughout the year.\n\nGet involved with #givingtuesday\n\n17 Donate money\n\nGive a gift that makes a difference by donating to your favourite cause by credit or debit card, PayPal or CAF Charity Account. UK taxpayers can add an extra 25p for every £1 you donate through Gift Aid.\n\nDonate now\n\n18 Sign up for payroll giving in 2019\n\nIf your employer offers a payroll giving scheme, such as CAF Give As You Earn, you can donate from your pre-tax salary and benefit from the full income tax relief.\n\nGet started with payroll giving\n\n19 Think global on International Human Solidarity Day\n\nEvery December, the United Nations General Assembly encourages people around the world to think about the value of human solidarity. Why not donate to an overseas charity?\n\n20 Throw an office party for charity\n\nThrow an office party and encourage everyone to contribute. Send round a donation tin to collect donations for your favourite cause and encourage your employer to match your contributions.\n\nGet started with matched giving"
