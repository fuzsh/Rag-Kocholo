The main factor driving our grantmaking to AMF is an analysis of its program’s cost-effectiveness. We summarize our cost-effectiveness analysis in detail in our separate report on mass distribution of insecticide-treated nets. This page provides additional information on AMF’s program, our qualitative assessment of AMF, and the monitoring and evaluation data AMF shares. This information feeds into our overall recommendation for AMF (alongside cost-effectiveness) and provides additional context so that we can understand and appropriately model the impact of its program.\n\nPublished: December 2023\n\nSummary\n\nWhat do they do? Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) provides funding for insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) (for protection against malaria) in low- and middle-income countries. AMF collaborates with each country’s national malaria program and other partner organizations to distribute ITNs in mass campaigns. AMF covers the costs of purchasing the nets and other partners cover the costs of distributing them to households (More).\n\nWe recommend AMF because of its:\n\nImplementation of a program (mass distribution of ITNs) that we think is very cost-effective (more in our separate report on ITNs).\n\nLong track record of supporting campaigns in a number of countries. (More)\n\nProcesses for tracking other actors’ malaria spending in the countries where AMF works, giving us more confidence that it is filling genuine funding gaps. (More)\n\nTransparency – AMF shares significant information about its work with us. (More)\n\nOur main reservations about AMF are:\n\nWe have some uncertainty about data from AMF’s post-distribution monitoring, so we rely on other sources of data and rough guesses for some parts of our cost-effectiveness analysis. (More)\n\nWhile we see all our top charities as exceptional relative to the majority of organizations, our qualitative assessment of AMF is less positive than for our other top charities. (More)\n\nWe have found it challenging to obtain and publish data on other funders’ contributions to the campaigns AMF supports. We see this as a concern because we rely on comprehensive data to produce an accurate analysis of the cost of AMF’s programs, and for transparency reasons. (More)\n\nThis assessment of AMF is based on the following components:\n\nWhat do you get for your dollar? We think that AMF is one of the most cost-effective organizations that donors can support. We estimate (as of December 2023) that it costs ~$3,000 to ~$8,000 to avert a death in locations where GiveWell funds campaigns. That’s because ITNs are cheap to purchase and distribute (roughly $4 to $6 per net) and significantly reduce malaria mortality, among other benefits.\n\nWe also have a number of uncertainties about the evidence for ITNs in general, including how long the protection from ITNs lasts and the level of insecticide resistance in locations where GiveWell funds ITN distributions. We discuss these in our separate report on ITNs\n\nWhat information has AMF shared on its program? We ask organizations that we fund to share monitoring data and other detailed information on their programs. We use the data as inputs in our cost-effectiveness analysis, and its quality and reliability also informs our overall assessment of the program.\n\nAMF has shared detailed information that we use to evaluate its program. We have a number of reservations about this information, which limits how much we are able to learn from it. The information we’ve seen includes:\n\nData from post-distribution surveys to determine whether nets have reached households and how long they remain in good condition. Overall, we think that the results from these surveys provide some signal that the campaigns it supports are reaching recipients as intended. We have a number of open questions about it, including:\n\nLower correspondence than we’d expect between monitoring data and audits of that data.\n\nMore positive findings about ITN condition over time than we would expect from other high quality net durability literature.\n\nWe therefore only use this data in a limited way in our cost-effectiveness analysis of AMF's program (more).\n\nData on AMF's spending, primarily on net purchase costs. We have seen only limited information on costs contributed by other funders to AMF-supported campaigns, which make up a substantial portion of the total cost to deliver nets to households (more).\n\nData on the number of nets distributed to households. We have not investigated the methodology used to gather this data in detail, but our understanding is that it is not audited. This reduces our confidence in the data and limits our ability to check its accuracy (more).\n\nBefore deciding whether to support campaigns, AMF gathers information on other malaria funders’ spending plans. This information increases our confidence that the programs AMF supports would not have been fully funded by another actor in AMF’s absence. This in turn increases our confidence that AMF’s funding results in a genuine increase in the overall number of nets distributed (more).\n\nWhat is GiveWell’s qualitative assessment of AMF? We make qualitative assessments of our top charities alongside our cost-effectiveness analyses to inform our grantmaking. While we see all our top charities as exceptional relative to the majority of organizations, our qualitative assessment of AMF is less positive than for our other top charities. Factors informing our assessment include (more):\n\nWhile AMF shares detailed information about its work, we have sometimes questioned whether the information we received is fully comprehensive or reliable. In some cases, we have found that information shared by AMF does not reflect the full picture after deeper investigation, and we perceive AMF as hesitant to bring us negative updates about its program. Our impression is also that AMF is less concerned about the issues we have identified in its monitoring than GiveWell.\n\nAlthough we have mainly heard positive feedback about AMF, we have occasionally received feedback that AMF can be difficult for national malaria programs to work with. Specifically, we have heard that its policy of funding only ITNs and not the costs to distribute those ITNs (more) and some of its monitoring requirements (more) can cause challenges.\n\nAMF is a small organization for its budget size. As of December 2023, it had 13 team members and was raising more than $100 million per year. It does not have the types of support staff (particularly in finance and human resources) that many organizations rely on to identify and mitigate risks to the organization. It also employs fewer staff focused on monitoring, evaluation, and research intended to evaluate and improve its program.\n\n1. What do they do?\n\n1.1 In a nutshell\n\nAgainst Malaria Foundation (AMF) supplies insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for protection against malaria to malaria endemic countries. AMF collaborates with each country’s national malaria program and other partner organizations to distribute these nets in mass distribution campaigns.\n\nMass distribution of ITNs is one of GiveWell’s top recommended programs. Our assessment is that there is strong evidence that these campaigns reduce child mortality (and may provide other benefits for which there is weaker evidence). We discuss the evidence for mass distribution of ITNs in detail on a separate page.\n\n1.2 Overview of Against Malaria Foundation’s activities\n\nAMF’s role in ITN campaigns includes:\n\nWorking with national malaria programs to identify funding gaps (more)\n\nProcuring nets (more)\n\nMonitoring and evaluation (more)\n\nThe national malaria program organizes each country’s ITN campaigns and is responsible for the country’s overall malaria control strategy. AMF’s partner organizations (either government health agencies or in-country non-profit organizations) are responsible for carrying out the ITN campaigns (more). AMF does not itself carry out campaigns or employ staff in countries where it funds ITNs. As of December 2023, AMF employs 13 staff members.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2021, AMF supported large-scale campaigns in eight countries (The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ghana, Guinea, Malawi, Papua New Guinea, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia), for a total of around 85 million ITNs distributed. A summary of AMF's campaigns in that period can be found in this spreadsheet. Since 2021, AMF has also supported campaigns in Chad, Nigeria, and South Sudan.\n\nCountries with AMF-supported campaigns (2012-23) are highlighted in blue (Papua New Guinea not shown)\n\nHow do ITN campaigns work?\n\nITNs are typically distributed through mass campaigns and \"continuous distribution\" channels.\n\nMass campaigns are time limited and involve large-scale distribution of ITNs to households, either door-to-door or through central distribution sites in a community. The aim of mass campaigns is to reach as many people as possible in a given location. The interval between campaigns recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is three years. Many malaria endemic countries aim to deliver nets on this three year schedule, and depending on their size they may conduct campaigns nationwide or on a regional level on a rolling basis.\n\nContinuous distribution involves ongoing distribution of ITNs during other touchpoints that people may have with the state or healthcare system. Continuous distribution is typically targeted at groups at elevated risk of malaria (e.g., young children and pregnant women), and also helps to fill coverage gaps that emerge after mass campaigns as nets are lost or deteriorate over time. Settings where people can access ITNs via continuous distribution include antenatal clinics, immunization clinics and schools.\n\nAs of 2017, the WHO recommends that malaria endemic countries should use a combination of mass campaigns and continuous distribution to achieve high coverage of ITNs. AMF focuses on supporting mass campaigns and our analysis below focuses on mass campaigns.\n\nIdentifying funding gaps\n\nNational malaria programs in malaria endemic countries receive funding for malaria control interventions from external donors. The largest of these donors are The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) and the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). Depending on the level of funding provided and the national malaria program’s specific malaria control priorities, this may leave funding gaps for ITN campaigns that the national malaria program wishes to conduct.\n\nWe have heard of a number of different strategies that national malaria programs employ when there are funding gaps. These can be divided into two main approaches:\n\nReducing the number of ITNs distributed in each campaign below the level needed to achieve universal coverage (e.g., by skipping subnational regions with lower malaria rates or regions that are targeted with another malaria intervention, or by reducing the number of ITNs distributed per household).\n\nExtending the interval between campaigns (e.g., by conducting rolling campaigns by region so that campaigns happen less often than every three years in each region, or delaying the campaign to continue fundraising).\n\nWe think that the impact of AMF’s funding varies depending on which approach the national malaria program would use without its funding:\n\nIn the first case, we think that the impact of AMF’s funding is to increase the number of people who receive a net in the campaign.\n\nIn the second case, we think that the impact of AMF’s funding is to shorten the interval between campaigns. We have received feedback from AMF that it believes this mischaracterizes the impact of its funding (see footnote for details).\n\nEach of these scenarios has different implications for our cost-effectiveness analysis (all else equal, we estimate that reducing the interval between campaigns is less cost-effective than increasing the number of people in a campaign who receive a net, although still highly cost-effective in some locations). See this section of our report on ITNs for a discussion of how this impacts our cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nAMF identifies these funding gaps primarily through discussions with national malaria program partners (including inbound funding requests from countries with funding gaps or renewing support to countries it supported in prior campaigns) and contacts at the Global Fund and PMI. AMF says that when selecting locations to support, it prioritizes based on the severity of the geography's malaria burden and the likelihood that the funding need will go unmet without support from AMF. The information that AMF collects and analyzes to assess whether funding needs will go unmet without their support is an important input into our cost-effectiveness analysis (discussed in more detail below).\n\nAs part of their negotiations, AMF, the relevant national malaria programs and partner organizations agree operational and funding details for each campaign. These include:\n\nFunding arrangements: In the campaigns we have seen, AMF has always covered the purchase cost for the nets, while partner organizations (in most cases the Global Fund) usually cover distribution and other \"non-net costs.\" AMF also covers the costs of its post-distribution monitoring (discussed below), although these are a small portion of total costs.\n\nThe in-country organization (either a government health agency or a non-profit organization) which will carry out the campaign and the process that will be used to carry out the campaign.\n\nWhat information will be collected and shared with AMF, how it will be collected and when it will be shared. AMF requires that all registration and distribution data is collected digitally rather than using paper-based forms.\n\nWe have received occasional feedback that AMF’s policy of paying for ITNs but not funding distribution costs can make it difficult for national malaria programs and partner organizations to work with. This policy can cause coordination challenges and delays because partners must reallocate some funding (usually funding that would have otherwise gone towards purchasing nets) to cover the distribution costs that AMF does not pay for. In the campaigns we have seen, the way that this typically happens is:\n\nA national malaria program plans to deliver a campaign, using funding from the Global Fund or PMI to purchase and distribute ITNs. There may be a funding gap, meaning the national malaria program cannot purchase and distribute the full number of nets it would ideally wish to (as an example, a $20m gap consisting of $10m required to purchase nets and $10m required to distribute them).\n\nAMF negotiates with the national malaria program to fill the funding gap by providing funding to purchase nets (in this example, $20m of nets).\n\nThe national malaria program then works with its other funding partner(s) to reallocate funds for the campaign. This involves these partners spending less on nets than originally planned, and more on distribution costs for the nets AMF has purchased. In the example above, this would involve partners other than AMF spending $10m less on nets and $10m more on distribution costs.\n\nOverall, this policy results in a larger number of nets being purchased, but additional time may be needed to coordinate the process and reallocate the funding. AMF notes that it sees benefits from this policy including each partner focusing on its area of specialization and simplifying coordination for in-country partners (e.g., because fewer distribution contracts are needed). We have not deeply investigated or tried to corroborate this.\n\nProcuring ITNs\n\nFor each campaign, AMF works with the national malaria program to identify which net types to use based on malaria prevalence, insecticide resistance and price data. It then purchases the nets, while other partners handle the costs of international shipping and logistics. We have previously heard from AMF that it can take over a year for nets to be ordered, manufactured, shipped to countries, and transported within countries. This means that AMF needs to order nets well in advance of when a campaign is scheduled to occur.\n\nDistribution of ITNs\n\nAMF’s in-country distribution partners (either government health agencies or non-profit organizations) typically pay for and manage the distribution of nets for each campaign. The specific processes used for campaigns have varied by country and over time. We provide a brief summary of key stages in the process below.\n\nRegistration\n\nDuring the registration process, national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door in targeted areas to collect the information used to determine the number of ITNs to allocate to each household (e.g., the number of sleeping spaces and/or the number of household members), as well as the information used to identify the household for the distribution and post-distribution surveys (e.g., the name of the head of the household and GPS data on household location).\n\nThe registration process is typically conducted before the distribution phase. The data gathered during registration provides campaign planners with information they can use to more accurately allocate the right number of ITNs to communities and households. However, our understanding is that in some campaigns the registration and distribution phases have taken place simultaneously (particularly campaigns conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to minimize the number of touchpoints with households). We have not investigated in detail what the implications have been for campaigns which conducted simultaneous registration and distribution.\n\nAs part of the registration process, AMF typically requires that a specified percentage (typically 5%) of registered households are randomly selected to be revisited by a second set of data collectors in the days after registration. AMF reports that the main objective of the backcheck is to improve data quality across the registration data, as workers implementing the registration know their work may be checked. This “backcheck” data and the original registration data are compared to assess the accuracy of the original registration data. We have previously received feedback that this procedure causes challenges for national malaria programs and other partners, because AMF does not cover the costs of the procedure and national malaria programs may have existing procedures that need to be replaced with a new methodology. AMF reports that it is now more explicit about this requirement in initial discussions with each country, and aims to ensure that partners do not have to incur extra costs as a result of the procedure (e.g., because AMF will purchase additional nets to compensate for the costs). It also reports that 5 of 8 countries where it works have adopted the procedure nationwide (including in areas where AMF does not fund nets). We have not independently investigated or tried to corroborate this.\n\nDistribution\n\nDistribution partners manage the logistics of in-country shipping and storage of ITNs prior to the distribution. To distribute ITNs to recipients, AMF's distribution partners have used a mixture of distribution procedures. In some cases, recipients collect nets from a specified distribution point in or near their community. In others, distributors travel door-to-door to hand out ITNs to households. In some door-to-door campaigns, distributors may assist households with hanging up nets (a \"hang-up\" procedure). Distribution partners may conduct awareness raising activities or meet with local leaders to prepare communities for the campaign.\n\nMonitoring and evaluation\n\nAMF funds in-country monitoring partners to monitor its campaigns. The main monitoring information we have seen is from AMF’s post-distribution monitoring (PDM) , which tracks whether ITNs are in good physical condition, retained in households and used as intended in the months and years after the campaign.\n\nPDMs are conducted by independent survey partners funded by AMF. PDMs survey a sample of households in the areas targeted by a campaign to assess the presence, usage, and condition of ITNs over time. Typically, PDMs survey 1.5% of registered households and occur at 9 months, 18 months and 27 months after the campaign.\n\nSee the section below for further details on the information we have reviewed from AMF’s monitoring.\n\nResearch on net effectiveness\n\nIn addition to its core activities, AMF has also funded research into the effectiveness of different kinds of ITN. As part of its support for the 2017 campaign in Uganda, it funded a randomized controlled trial of PBO (piperonyl butoxide) ITNs. PBO is added to ITNs to mitigate the impact of insecticide resistance. The study was the second large scale trial of PBO nets and found that, in an area of Uganda with high insecticide resistance, PBOs outperformed standard pyrethroid LLINs (long-lasting insecticidal nets) for 25 months after distribution. More details on the research are available in this blog post. As of 2019, the WHO conditionally recommends that PBO nets should be distributed instead of standard LLINs in areas where mosquitoes exhibit certain kinds of insecticide resistance. This study was continued during the Uganda 2020 and 2023 mass campaigns, with each campaign testing the efficacy of a newly developed net to combat insecticide resistance.\n\n1.3 How does Against Malaria Foundation use its funding?\n\nA large majority of AMF’s total funding is dedicated to ITN purchases, with small proportions going towards \"non-net costs\" (e.g., costs related to distributing nets or conducting post-distribution monitoring), insecticide resistance research costs, and operational costs. In the past, AMF also paid for electronic data entry for some paper-based distributions.\n\nSee the table below for a breakdown from July 2011 to June 2022. We include spending since FY 2012 (July 2011 to June 2012) because this is when AMF shifted to its current model of larger-scale campaigns.\n\nCategory July 2011 to June 2022 spending Percentage of total spending, FY 2012 to 2022 Net purchases $347 million 95% Costs of distributing nets and monitoring (\"non-net costs\") $12 million 3% Insecticide resistance research $3 million 1% Salaries and other organizational costs $4 million 1% Total spending $366 million -\n\n2. Monitoring and information sharing\n\n2.1 Overview\n\nGiveWell asks organizations that we fund to share detailed information on their programs. The aim of reviewing this information is to assess how much the program costs, whether the program is being conducted to a high quality, and whether it is reaching recipients as intended. We use data from these reviews as inputs in our cost-effectiveness analyses, and the quality and reliability of the information we’ve seen also informs our qualitative assessment of the program.\n\nAMF and its partners collect a large volume of information about the campaigns it supports, and AMF is transparent about sharing this data. This includes:\n\nData on the number of households registered to receive nets and the number of nets distributed to them (more).\n\nPost-distribution monitoring to assess net usage, ownership and physical condition over time (more).\n\nInformation on costs incurred to deliver the campaigns it supports (more).\n\nInformation on other funders’ malaria spending (more).\n\nThis information allows us to better understand AMF’s work, but we have a number of reservations about its quality and completeness, including:\n\nConcerns about some aspects of AMF’s post-distribution monitoring (more). These include:\n\nLow rates of correspondence between the main data and audited data.\n\nMore positive findings about ITN retention over time than we would expect from other high quality net durability literature. AMF reports that more recent surveys do not follow this trend, although we have not yet analyzed the data to assess this claim.\n\nConcerns about the quality of the registration data used to allocate nets to households, again because of low rates of correspondence between the original registration data and audited data (more).\n\nLimited visibility into the data on the number of nets distributed to households in each campaign, which is not subject to data audits (more).\n\nVery limited data on costs contributed by other funders to AMF-supported campaigns. This is a concern because we use estimates of other funders’ spending as part of our analysis of the cost per net (more).\n\nAMF’s post-distribution monitoring also samples only from households who have been registered to receive nets in the campaign, not the population as a whole. While we think this is appropriate for AMF’s main intended use of the data (understanding what happens to AMF-distributed nets over time), it means the data is less informative for understanding what proportion of the overall population are reached with nets, as some households may be missed by the registration process.\n\nUltimately, the information AMF has shared with GiveWell informs either our cost-effectiveness analysis, our qualitative assessment of AMF, or both. We divide our analysis below into information AMF has shared which directly feeds into our cost-effectiveness analysis (more), and information AMF has shared which we use in other ways (more).\n\n2.2 Information informing our cost-effectiveness analysis\n\nCost information\n\nFor each of our top recommended programs, GiveWell conducts a \"cost per output\" analysis. This analysis aims to estimate the total cost to deliver one unit of the intervention (in this case, one net distributed to a household). Each analysis is designed to be comprehensive and include commodity purchases, distribution, organizational and other costs required to deliver the program.\n\nWe calculate the cost per ITN distributed in each country based on the following estimates:\n\nEstimates of the costs that AMF expects to pay to purchase each ITN in the future (at the time we made our most recent grant). We adjust these to account for an estimate of the proportion of nets which are purchased but not delivered, based on previous campaigns. Averaging across countries and net types, this accounts for 52% of total costs.\n\nEstimates of the \"non-net\" costs (e.g., distribution costs) per ITN. This is based on estimates of costs that AMF and other funders incurred in previous campaigns (rather than projections of future spending). These account for 44% of total costs on average.\n\nThis is an uncertain part of our analysis, because we have very limited information on other funders’ non-net costs for AMF-supported campaigns. We rely on country-specific information on costs incurred by the Global Fund, but the information we have only covers a small number of previous campaigns (including some but not all the countries in our analysis). This means we’re unsure how reliable or generalizable it is.\n\nA rough estimate of the value of in-kind government contributions (e.g., staff time) to the ITN campaigns that AMF supports. These account for 5% of total costs on average.\n\nAs of December 2023, we estimate that it costs between approximately $4 and $6 (varying by location) to distribute each ITN.\n\nUnlike most of our analysis, our estimates of cost per ITN are unpublished. This is because we have not received permission to publish country-specific cost estimates we received from the Global Fund or AMF’s projections for the costs it expects to pay to procure each net by country and net type, which our calculations rely on. AMF notes that, while they would like to allow the publishing of net costs, in keeping with their approach to transparency, doing so has the risk of compromising sensitive net price negotiations with manufacturers.\n\nWe discuss our method for calculating these estimates in detail in our separate report on mass distribution of ITNs (here).\n\nDistribution data\n\nAMF’s partners (either national health agencies or in-country non-profit organizations) gather data at the distribution stage of each campaign on the number of nets distributed to households. AMF has shared this data with GiveWell for previous campaigns, and we use this data as one input into our estimates of AMF’s cost per net (discussed above). Specifically, we use data on the proportion of nets that were purchased but not distributed in previous campaigns (e.g., because they are lost, stolen, damaged, or otherwise not accounted for) to estimate the proportion of nets that will be purchased but not distributed in the future. As of December 2023, we estimate that this proportion is 5% overall (varying somewhat by country, from 2% in Uganda to 10% in Guinea).\n\nOur main uncertainty about this data is that we have very little visibility into how it was collected. We have not investigated in detail the methodology used to collect the data or possible sources of bias to the same extent as for AMF’s post-distribution monitoring. Our understanding is also that the distribution data is not audited (whereas the data collected on registration and in post-distribution monitoring is). This reduces our confidence in the data and limits our ability to check its accuracy.\n\nInformation on other malaria funding\n\nWhen negotiating with national malaria programs and other malaria funders, AMF has a process for tracking how each national malaria program plans to spend its budget and what proportion of that budget goes towards campaigns. It uses this information to assess whether in its view there is a genuine gap for net campaigns, whether national malaria programs and other funders are taking AMF’s previous support for the program into account in their funding decisions, and whether other partners are likely to fund the campaign in AMF’s absence.\n\nThis information is among the most comprehensive we have seen from any grantee on other actors’ spending. We find this information valuable because we aim to account for other actors’ spending behavior in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we adjust our cost-effectiveness estimates to account for the likelihood that our grantees’ funding is causing other actors (governments and NGOs) to spend more or less on a program than they otherwise would.\n\nThe way AMF’s process typically works is:\n\nThe Global Fund, the largest global funder of malaria programs, determines its funding allocations to national governments on a three-year cycle.\n\nFor each funding gap it considers, AMF asks national malaria programs and other funders to fill out a spreadsheet with information about how the current Global Fund malaria allocation is being used, how that compares to the previous Global Fund malaria allocation, and what other funding sources are supporting the malaria budget. See GiveWell’s summary here for an example of this information for the 2018-20 and 2021-23 Global Fund allocations for Togo, Guinea, Chad and Uganda.\n\nThis information allows AMF and GiveWell to monitor patterns in how the country’s malaria budget is being used, including patterns which give us clues about the likelihood that a funding gap would be filled in any case without AMF support. This is one input we use to generate the adjustments for other actors’ spending in our cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n2.3 Information that we use in other ways\n\nSome of the information AMF has shared with GiveWell does not feed directly into our cost-effectiveness analysis but does still inform our view of AMF as an organization. We use this information either indirectly to feed into our cost-effectiveness analysis (more), or as part of our qualitative assessment of AMF (more).\n\nRegistration\n\nThe ITN registration process, during which national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door to determine the number of nets required for each household, is summarized above.\n\nAMF publishes data from the registration process and has shared more detailed registration information for some campaigns with GiveWell. We have not reviewed this data as carefully or comprehensively as we have reviewed data from AMF’s post-distribution monitoring (see below), and we have more limited information on the methodology used to collect this data.\n\nAMF also requires that the campaigns it supports conduct a \"backcheck\" after the registration process, where a small percentage (typically 5%) of households randomly selected to be re-registered by different data collectors to validate the initial registration data. In principle, we see the backcheck procedure as a positive, both because it may encourage more accurate data collection (if staff conducting the registration think their work may be audited) and because it provides a check on the accuracy of the data. However, as discussed in an earlier section of the review, we have previously received feedback that this procedure can cause problems for AMF’s partners.\n\nWe have also previously seen AMF analysis indicating low levels of correspondence (exact correspondence in the 65% to 95% range, varying by country) between the registration and backcheck data in previous AMF-supported campaigns. These rates are lower than we would have expected, given the seeming objectivity of the data collected (the number of residents per household and number of sleeping spaces) and reduce our confidence in the accuracy of the registration data. In 2021, we also compared the registration and backcheck data for AMF-supported campaigns in Uganda and Togo in 2020 to inform a grant decision for future campaigns in both countries. We found similar levels of correspondence to AMF’s previous analysis. See this section of our grant page for further details.\n\nMonitoring and evaluation\n\nAMF funds in-country monitoring partners to monitor its campaigns. The main monitoring information we have seen is from AMF’s post-distribution monitoring (PDM), which tracks whether ITNs are in good physical condition, retained in households, and used as intended in the months and years after the campaign, as well as the proportion of people in the household protected by nets. We use this data to understand what proportion of distributed ITNs reach their intended recipients, are used by those recipients, and remain effective while they are in use.\n\nOverview of post-distribution monitoring\n\nAMF's PDMs are conducted by independent partners funded by AMF. These partners survey a sample of households in the areas targeted by a campaign to assess the presence, usage, and condition of ITNs over time. Typically, PDMs survey 1.5% of registered households and occur at 9 months, 18 months and 27 months after the campaign.\n\nOur analysis focuses on three outcomes we can evaluate based on the data collected in PDMs:\n\nSelf-reported net usage: What proportion of household members report sleeping under any net found hanging by data collectors (AMF-distributed or not) the previous night?\n\nInferred usage (from net presence): As part of the PDM, data collectors assess what proportion of AMF-distributed nets are found hanging in households. We then use this figure to calculate an \"inferred\" usage rate (see below).\n\nNet condition: What physical condition are the households nets in (as classified by the data collector)?\n\nAs of December 2023, we have reviewed results from 19 of the 22 large-scale campaigns that occurred from 2017-2021. As such, we are reasonably confident that we have seen a thorough picture of the impact of AMF's work in those years. We have not yet reviewed results from campaigns that AMF supported more recently, which means that the results presented below may not capture any differences in the outcomes achieved by those recent campaigns. See this spreadsheet for the results and methods of PDMs since 2017.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results from the PDMs we have reviewed. A more detailed summary of the PDMs is available below for both methodology (more below) and detailed results (more below).\n\nSurvey period Outcome 6-11 months 12-17 months 18-23 months 24-30 months Self-reported net usage (% of people sleeping under nets found hanging) 83% avg 70% avg 69% avg 60% avg Inferred usage (Based on % AMF-distributed nets found hanging) 68% avg 63% avg 62% avg 56% avg Net condition (% nets in at least \"viable\" condition) 89% avg 82% avg 80% avg 65% avg\n\nMethodology\n\nAMF's PDMs survey households in the areas targeted by a campaign to assess the presence, usage, and condition of ITNs in those households. Typically, PDMs survey 1.5% of registered households and occur at 9 months, 18 months and 27 months after the campaign. We have focused on understanding the methodology used in the PDMs of AMF's recent campaigns in DRC (Équateur province, 2019), Guinea (2019), Ghana (2018), Malawi (2018), Togo (2017), Uganda (2017), and Zambia (2017). Full details of those PDMs are in the \"Methods\" sheets of this spreadsheet.\n\nAlthough they are included in the results above, we have not reviewed the methodology used for more recent campaigns in DRC (2020 and 2021), Togo (2020), and Uganda (2020). The discussion that follows therefore does not apply to those campaigns, though AMF has informed us that the methodology used for those more recent campaigns has been largely similar. We have also not reviewed the methodology of surveys taking place since 2021.\n\nBelow, we summarize AMF's general PDM methodology and discuss methodological strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we believe that AMF's PDMs are designed to measure the key indicators of the success of a campaign, and the fact that respondents are selected randomly and ITNs can be directly observed increases the credibility of the results.\n\nHowever, our confidence in the accuracy of these results is reduced by the fact that AMF only surveys households that were registered to receive nets during the relevant campaign (more on the registration process above), moderate to high sample attrition in several cases, the potential for respondent bias on self-reported measures, only moderate correspondence in results found by AMF's auditing procedure, and more positive findings about ITN durability over time than we would expect from other high quality net durability literature.\n\nRespondent selection: AMF selects households to be surveyed during PDMs from the household-level data collected during registration. Because AMF only samples households that were registered to receive nets, its surveys do not capture households that might have been missed by the registration process. This means that the surveys do not provide information about what proportion of the target population was not registered at all (and therefore missed by the campaign).\n\nAMF randomly selects villages and households from all regions or districts that were covered by the campaign of AMF-funded nets. AMF also randomly selects \"spare\" households that can be visited if households on the original list are unavailable.\n\nAMF's inclusion of all regions or districts and its random sampling of villages and households increase the likelihood that the sample of households it selects is representative of the population that received nets. However, AMF's sampling procedure results in households from smaller villages being overrepresented in the sample because, in almost all cases, AMF selects the same number of households per village. Because AMF has data from registration on the total number of households per village, it is possible to correct for this overrepresentation. AMF has shared results from some PDMs that are weighted by village size. Weighted results show slightly higher (1-5% across PDMs) proportions of nets found present and hanging in households compared with unweighted results. This suggests that AMF's sampling procedure results in a slight downward bias in results, at least for this outcome.\n\nAnother concern is that sample attrition (i.e., households randomly selected to be interviewed not being interviewed) may bias results upward, as households that cannot be interviewed during PDMs may also have been less likely to be reached by the campaign; see footnote for AMF's response to this concern. In PDMs in Malawi and Zambia, around 60% to 65% of households selected to be interviewed were interviewed, and in the Équateur province of DRC, 67% were interviewed; we believe these figures suggest a high risk of bias in results from those countries. In Guinea, Togo, and Uganda, these figures are ~75% to ~85% of households selected to be interviewed, which we believe suggest a moderate risk of bias.\n\nWe also note that because sampling is among households that were registered to receive nets, the survey is not designed to check what proportion of the total population was missed by the campaign, as many other surveys aim to.\n\nSurvey design: AMF contracts with other organizations to implement PDMs (\"PDM implementers\"). AMF provides PDM implementers with a standard questionnaire, which AMF may adapt for each context. Data collectors are instructed to directly assess net presence, hang-up, and condition by observing nets in respondents' homes. They also ask respondents to report the number of ITNs received by the household during the campaign, to report nets that are taken down during the day but hung at night, and to answer additional questions about net usage during the previous night.\n\nWe believe that some of the responses collected through this survey are at relatively low risk of bias. The presence and condition of ITNs (both those found hanging and reported as taken down during the day but hung at night) are objective measures that data collectors can directly assess. However, self-reported responses are at greater risk of bias. Responses about ITN hang-up and usage during the previous night may be at risk of social desirability bias that leads respondents to overreport usage, though validation of these responses is possible through comparison with objective measures. Responses about the number of ITNs received by the household report on an event that occurred at least 9 months prior and thus may be at risk of recall bias. AMF has shared results from some PDMs that replace self-reported responses with data on the number of nets that households were registered to receive. Results using registered ITNs show slightly lower (2% to 8% across PDMs) proportions of distributed ITNs found present and hanging in households compared with results using self-reported ITNs. The direction of these differences is consistent with our expectation that more ITNs are registered than are actually received by households, as net need at times outstrips the number of nets procured, leading to rationing in the distribution. The magnitude of this difference suggests that recall bias is not a major concern.\n\nSurvey implementation: The PDM implementer recruits data collectors and supervisors to conduct and oversee data collection. With one exception, PDM implementer organizations were not involved in the campaign, which suggests that they are unlikely to have a personal interest in survey outcomes. In multiple cases, however, data collectors and/or supervisors hired by the PDM implementer to conduct the survey were involved in the campaign, though in the PDMs they are typically assigned to survey different areas than those in which they supported the campaign. These individuals may have a personal interest in survey outcomes reflecting favorably on the campaign, such that results are biased upward; we have not seen evidence that this incentive influenced data collection and note it only as a possibility.\n\nAMF selects 5% of surveyed households to be re-surveyed within one to seven days by a different data collector or supervisor who is blinded to the original results. Because data collectors are aware that their work will be audited, this procedure may encourage accurate data collection. It also provides a check on the accuracy of results. The first step in analyzing this data is to pair re-survey records with records from the original data collection using household identification numbers. Overall, AMF has paired around 85% of re-survey records with original records across all PDMs. AMF told us that records may not be paired for several reasons — most notably, because households that were unavailable for the original data collection may still be re-surveyed if their availability changes; this is consistent with high attrition in surveys (discussed above).\n\nThe next step in analyzing this data is to check for correspondence between re-survey records and original records along several data points. We are particularly interested in correspondence levels for the number of ITNs that are present and hanging, which includes both ITNs found hanging by data collectors and ITNs that households report as being taken down during the day but hung at night. Across PDMs, exact correspondence on this number has ranged from 44% to 85%. Correspondence within +/- 1 (meaning re-survey records find either the exact same number of nets hanging, one more, or one fewer) has ranged from 78% to 92%. AMF notes that more recent PDMs (conducted in 2022 and 2023) show higher levels of correspondence, although we have not yet analyzed data from more recent surveys to assess this claim or understand what could be driving this difference.\n\nThese correspondence rates are lower than we would have expected, given the seeming objectivity of this measure; they suggest that different data collectors may be assessing this measure differently, that households may be reporting differently on different days, or that these figures reflect a true change in net presence in a matter of days. Regardless of the explanation, these correspondence rates decrease our confidence in the accuracy of the original results. AMF notes that it considers these results acceptable according to its criteria.\n\nDetailed results\n\nNet usage\n\nWe define net usage as the proportion of people living in households that were targeted by an AMF campaign who subsequently sleep under a net, thereby benefiting from the protective effect against malaria. To understand the usage achieved by AMF's campaigns, we use two types of PDM data: self-reported data from respondents about their usage of all ITNs found hanging in households, and data about the presence of AMF-distributed ITNs in households, from which we can infer usage.\n\nDuring household interviews, PDM data collectors ask respondents to report their net usage during the previous night by specifying how many people slept under each ITN found hanging in the household, including AMF-distributed ITNs and ITNs from other sources.\n\nThis data provides a \"reported\" usage rate, defined as the proportion of people sleeping in the household the previous night who slept under any hanging net. See reported usage rates for different countries and time points in this spreadsheet, sheet \"Results: Summary.\" In short:\n\nReported usage is generally high 6-11 months post-distribution (i.e., as measured by that campaign’s first PDM), varying from 72% (Malawi 2018) to 94% (DRC Kongo Central 2020).\n\nReported usage decreases over time. Across PDMs, average reported usage is 83% between 6-11 months post-distribution and 60% between 24-30 months post-distribution. This matches our expectation that ownership of usable ITNs decreases over time from the point of distribution, as nets wear out.\n\nPDMs conducted after Zambia's 2017 campaign found relatively low usage compared to other PDMs.\n\nDuring household interviews, PDM data collectors also ask respondents how many ITNs their household received from the relevant AMF campaign (by visually inspecting the net label), then classify each reported AMF netas either present and hanging (which includes both nets found hanging by data collectors and nets that households report as being taken down during the day but hung at night), present and not hanging, missing, or worn out. We use this data, and an estimate that on average each net covers 1.8 people, to calculate an \"inferred\" usage rate representing the usage provided by AMF-distributed nets found hanging. This measure captures a different outcome (usage from all nets versus usage from AMF-distributed nets). See inferred usage rates for different countries and time points in this spreadsheet, sheet \"Results: Summary.\" In short:\n\nInferred usage 6-11 months post-distribution (i.e., as measured by that campaign’s first PDM) varies from 57% (DRC Haut Lomami 2020) to 83% (Uganda 2017).\n\nLike reported usage, inferred usage decreases over time, from an average of 68% between 6-11 months post-distribution to an average of 56% between 24-30 months post-distribution.\n\nIn almost all cases, reported usage from all ITNs is higher than inferred usage from AMF-distributed ITNs, suggesting that households use ITNs from other sources in addition to AMF-distributed ITNs and/or that more people sleep under nets than 1.8 on average. The difference between reported usage and inferred usage remains fairly consistent across PDMs for the same campaigns.\n\nThese two measures are subject to different potential sources of bias. On the one hand, reported usage is a more direct measure that explicitly asks households how they use ITNs, but it may be subject to social desirability bias that leads respondents to overreport usage. On the other hand, inferred usage is an indirect measure that relies on our assumptions about how households use ITNs, but it uses data that is at somewhat lower risk of bias. We see these data as providing cumulative evidence that, in general, a reasonably high proportion of targeted recipients sleep under ITNs over time.\n\nNet condition\n\nOur expectation that ITN usage confers a protective effect against malaria requires that ITNs remain effective over time. To understand the effectiveness of AMF-distributed ITNs over time, we review ITN condition data from AMF's PDMs. AMF reports on whether each net found in a household is either in \"very good,\" \"good,\" \"viable,\" or \"worn out\" condition. See the proportion of hanging nets in at least \"viable\" condition for different countries and time points in this spreadsheet, sheet \"Results: Summary.\" In short:\n\nAcross countries, PDMs conducted between 6-11 months found an average of 89% of nets in at least \"viable\" condition. Uganda (2017) had the highest rate of viability at 99%, and DRC (Tanganyika province, 2020) had the lowest at 62% for the 6-11 month range.\n\nFor the campaigns that occurred between 2017 and 2021, we have seen results from eight PDMs conducted at 24-30 months post-distribution, which found lower rates of hanging nets in at least \"viable\" condition (an average of 65%).\n\nAcross time, the average proportion of nets in at least \"viable\" condition decreases from 89% at 6-11 months to 82% at 12-17 months, 80% at 18-23 months, and 65% at 24-30 months. This matches our expectation that ITN condition decreases over time from the point of distribution.\n\nThese results imply more positive findings about ITN durability over time than we would expect from other high quality net durability literature. For comparison with independent studies measuring net durability over time, see the results summarized in this spreadsheet, “PermaNet 2.0 Field Study Data Inputs” sheet.\n\nThe measure where we see a major discrepancy is net retention. AMF’s PDMs report consistently high levels of net retention over time (over 90% up to 24 months post-distribution). This compares to an average of around 70% nets retained after 24 months in the independent studies we have assessed. Some (though not all) of the independent studies track net retention by enrolling and tagging study nets at baseline, and then follow up on the same cohort of nets over time. Our best guess is that this is a more accurate methodology than the method used in AMF’s PDMs, which rely on self-reports on the number of nets retained over time.\n\nTo reflect our higher level of confidence, we use the data on net durability from independent studies in our cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the durability of ITNs distributed by AMF over time rather than the data from AMF’s PDMs (more in this section).\n\nAMF reports that more recent surveys it has conducted (in 2022 and 2023) show significantly lower levels of retention than previous PDMs. We have not yet analyzed data from more recent surveys to assess this claim or understand what could be driving this difference.\n\nHow AMF’s monitoring feeds into our cost-effectiveness analysis\n\nOverall, we believe that these results provide some signal that AMF-supported campaigns are reaching recipients as intended. However, our confidence in the accuracy of these results is reduced by the fact that AMF only surveys households that were registered to receive nets during the relevant campaign, moderate to high sample attrition in several cases, the potential for respondent bias on self-reported measures, only moderate correspondence in results found by AMF's auditing procedure, and more positive findings about ITN durability over time than we would expect from other high quality net durability literature. This means we have significant uncertainty about the precision of the data. AMF notes that it is engaging with GiveWell to discuss possible changes to its monitoring approach to address some of these concerns.\n\nWe therefore only use our analysis of AMF’s PDMs in a limited way in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we roughly adjust our cost-effectiveness estimate for AMF’s ITN program downwards to account for our level of confidence in AMF’s monitoring and evaluation.\n\nInstead, to assess the usage and condition of AMF’s ITNs over time, our cost-effectiveness analysis relies on estimates based on other sources of data or rough guesses:\n\nNet condition: ITN campaigns typically take place at three-year intervals, but ITNs degrade over time and on average provide less than three years of full protection over the distribution cycle. As of December 2023, we estimate that ITNs in AMF campaigns in most countries confer two years of effective coverage during each distribution cycle relative to the nets evaluated in previous studies. This estimate is based on independent studies that tracked, in real life conditions, the retention, physical survival (i.e., number and size of holes), and insecticide effectiveness at killing mosquitoes of two of the main brands of ITNs that AMF has purchased in the past.\n\nOne exception where we do use AMF data from PDMs is our adjustment for lower net durability (-17% as of December 2023) in DRC. This adjustment is based in part on evidence from an AMF PDM survey in one province in DRC in 2019.\n\nNet usage: We roughly estimate that average usage rates for ITNs in AMF campaigns are 63% across all countries. This estimate is based on usage data from three studies in a meta-analysis of insecticide-treated nets, which found average usage rates of around 70%. We then adjust this estimate downwards because we expect that usage rates in contemporary campaigns would be lower than usage rates in randomized controlled trials (which included activities to encourage usage and guidance on how to hang nets properly).\n\nAdjustment for pre-existing nets: Some people may receive ITNs in AMF campaigns when they already have a non-worn-out net available from previous campaigns. We account for this with an adjustment for pre-existing nets. As of December 2023, we estimate that this reduces the effectiveness of AMF’s ITN campaigns by 3% to 7% (varying by location).\n\n3. Qualitative assessment\n\nIn theory, our recommendations are maximizing for one thing: total improvement in well-being per dollar spent. This is what our cost-effectiveness estimates intend to capture.\n\nIn practice, there are costs and benefits that we do not observe and are not estimated in our models. We make qualitative assessments to account for these unmodeled costs and benefits. We then use these assessments alongside our cost-effectiveness estimates to inform our funding recommendations.\n\nAs one tool for thinking through and communicating about impressions we have that aren't captured in our cost-effectiveness estimates, we assess each top charity on eight dimensions on a four-point scale (“Stands out,” “Relatively strong,” “Average,” “Relatively weak”). We believe our top charities are exceptional relative to the majority of organizations and so these assessments are intended to capture differences among GiveWell top charities, rather than absolute rankings among all charitable organizations. Our latest assessment of AMF (for 2023) is in the table below.\n\nDimension What does this capture? Assessment of AMF Responses to our questions When we ask the organization a question, do its answers generally either indicate that it has thought through the question before or show us why getting an answer is not important to understanding its work? Average Prioritization discussions Do the organization’s explanations about how it allocates funding among different locations and program participants seem to be aimed at maximizing its impact per dollar? Average Self-improvement and attitude toward mistakes Does the organization proactively share information with us and publicly about mistakes it has made? Average Role in field Is the organization producing research aimed at informing policymakers or other implementers? Does it participate in global conversations about its field of work? Average Responsiveness Does the organization send us information by mutually agreed-upon deadlines? Is it responsive to our emails? Relatively weak Giving us feedback Does the organization catch our mistakes and let us know, thus improving our research? Does the organization make useful suggestions for how we could improve our research process and cost-effectiveness models? Average Quality of information shared Have the documents that the organization has shared with us contained significant errors? Has the organization told us things that were inaccurate? Has the information provided been easy to interpret and use? Have the organization’s projections of when it would achieve its goals generally been accurate? Average Incorporating feedback from participants and last mile providers How does the program collect feedback from program participants and from program implementers, i.e., those directly delivering the program? How does the program incorporate feedback to improve service delivery? Not yet assessed\n\nSome of the main factors informing our assessment are:\n\nResponses to our questions (average)\n\nAMF has generally engaged with and shared detailed responses to our questions. However, in some cases we have had concerns about the reliability of these responses.\n\nFor example, our grants rely on best guesses of what would happen in a scenario without GiveWell-directed funding, which we refer to as \"the counterfactual.\" One input into our view of the counterfactual to a given grant is what AMF tells us it believes the most likely counterfactual to be (which we aim to corroborate by having conversations with other program stakeholders and by reviewing the track record of previous campaigns in a given country). There have been cases in which we felt, after more investigation, that the situation was different or more nuanced than AMF had communicated to us. We see this as a concern because it directly impacts our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of AMF’s program (more here in our separate report on ITNs).\n\nSelf-improvement and attitude toward mistakes (average)\n\nWe strongly value working with organizations that proactively bring negative updates (i.e., concerns or problems about the programs they support that might affect our view of those programs) to our attention. We perceive AMF as being somewhat hesitant to do so. Part of what informs this impression is we have perceived AMF to be less concerned than we are about issues we've identified in the data it collects (e.g., the lack of correspondence discussed above between original and revisit data in post-distribution monitoring).\n\nWe perceive AMF as being less invested in improving its monitoring & evaluation or pursuing other routes to fill data gaps (e.g., conducting a costing study to gather information about other funders' contributions).\n\nRole in field (average)\n\nWe have heard from one partner organization that AMF played an important role in building production capacity for PBO nets. Our understanding of this feedback is that AMF was an early adopter of PBO nets relative to other ITN funders, and the scale of their PBO purchases encouraged manufacturers to start or scale up production.\n\nResponsiveness (relatively weak)\n\nAMF has been more likely to submit information after the agreed upon date than our other top charities. In one case in 2022, we made a grant to AMF on the condition that it would provide us with certain information before signing an agreement with a national malaria program and it did not do so.\n\nQuality of information shared (average)\n\nAMF generates a large volume of data about its campaigns and is transparent about sharing that data. This includes real-time access to AMF systems containing net purchase data, registration and distribution data and data from AMF’s post-distribution monitoring. However, we have sometimes found it difficult to interpret this data (e.g., because it lacked clear documentation) and have not always been confident in the quality of the data (see the section above for further details).\n\nAs we discuss above, AMF has established processes for tracking other funders’ contributions to the campaigns it supports. It uses this information to determine whether it thinks that there is a genuine funding gap before it commits funding to ITN campaigns. On at least one occasion AMF has declined to fund a campaign because it was concerned that the impact of supporting the campaign would be to free up funding for another intervention (e.g., indoor residual spraying) rather than increasing the volume of ITNs delivered. Although we have not always agreed with AMF’s conclusions about the implications of this information, we find this process and the information AMF shares from it valuable. This is because our cost-effectiveness analysis aims to account for how AMF’s funding for a program might impact other actors’ spending. For more information about how we estimate these adjustments, see this section of our report on ITNs.\n\nGiving us feedback (average)\n\nAMF has engaged with and given feedback on the cost-effectiveness models we use to evaluate its programs. However, our impression is that this feedback much more often seems to be aimed at increasing than decreasing estimated cost-effectiveness, which leads us to put less weight on it. For example, AMF has consistently disagreed with the downward adjustments we use to account for the impact on other actors’ spending (more here in our separate report on ITNs) and for the impact of its spending reducing the interval between campaigns rather than expanding coverage in a given campaign (more here). We haven't been able to reach agreement on the inputs we use for these adjustments in some locations.\n\nOther factors\n\nIn many conversations with national malaria programs and AMF's other partners, we have explicitly asked for feedback about AMF as a partner and have broadly heard positive feedback. We have, however, occasionally received feedback that AMF can be difficult for national malaria programs to work with, relative to other ITN funders. We have heard two main points of constructive feedback. Firstly, that AMF’s policy of funding only ITNs and not the costs to distribute those ITNs can cause delays and coordination problems (more), and secondly that its requirement to \"backcheck\" 5% of households registered to receive ITNs can make it difficult to work with, because it does not cover the costs of this procedure (more).\n\nAMF is a small organization for its budget size. As of December 2023, it had 13 team members and was raising over $100 million per year. It does not have the types of support staff (particularly in finance and human resources) that many organizations rely on to identify and mitigate risks to the organization. It also employs fewer staff focused on monitoring, evaluation, and research intended to evaluate and improve its program. This organizational size and structure is notably different from GiveWell's other top charities.\n\n4. What do you get for your dollar?\n\nGiveWell recommends programs that we believe are cost-effective in the sense of saving or improving lives as much as possible for as little money as possible. We summarize the full reasoning behind our cost-effectiveness analysis for AMF in our separate report. In summary, as of December 2023, we think:\n\nIt costs between $3,000 and $8,000 to save a life in countries where GiveWell currently supports AMF to deliver ITN campaigns. This equates to being 9x to 23x as cost-effective as direct cash transfers (GiveWell’s benchmark for comparing different programs). This is because:\n\nMalaria is a major driver of child deaths in countries where we fund free distribution of ITNs.\n\nITNs provide strong protection against malaria and deaths caused by malaria.\n\nIn addition to preventing childhood malaria deaths, we think ITNs provide additional benefits through protecting individuals above the age of five from malaria mortality and lead to long-term increases in income later in life.\n\nITNs are relatively inexpensive to provide (approximately $4 to $6 each).\n\nSee our report on ITNs for more details.\n\n5.
