        "text": "Advocacy | Nonprofit Organizations | Religion | Legends\n\nADVOCACY\n\nStacey Abrams\n\nFounder and Chair\n\nFair Fight\n\nAfter serving 11 years in the Georgia House of Representatives, including seven as minority leader, Stacey Abrams became the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia in 2018. The first Black woman to receive a major-party nomination in a gubernatorial race in the United States, Abrams got more votes than any Democrat in the stateâs history. Following the election, Abrams launched the organization Fair Fight to mobilize voters, advocate for electoral reform, and fight voter suppression. In January 2019, she was tapped to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union address. In 2022, Abrams was again the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia. In 2023, Abrams, a New York Times bestselling author, was appointed as the inaugural Ronald W. Walters Endowed Chair for Race and Black Politics at Howard University.\n\nEDUCATION Spelman College, University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs (MPAff), Yale Law School (JD)\n\nNOTABLE ACHIEVEMENT Founded the New Georgia Project, which submitted more than 200,000 registrations from voters of color between 2014 and 2016\n\nDouglas B. Ammar\n\nExecutive Director\n\nGeorgia Justice Project\n\nDouglas B. Ammar has been an active presence at Georgia Justice Project (GJP) since its beginning in 1986. Starting as a volunteer, then joining as a staff attorney in 1990, Ammar became executive director in 1995. GJP provides holistic criminal defense and social services while seeking systemic change in Georgia law that will reduce the number of people under correctional control and reduce barriers to reentry into society. During his leadership, GJP has helped to change 22 laws in Georgia, such as Senate Bill 288 which enables Georgians to have second chances by expanding access to record restriction and sealing for certain eligible Georgia criminal records.\n\nEDUCATION Davidson College, Washington and Lee University School of Law (JD)\n\nHOMETOWN Charleston, West Virginia\n\nWHY I CHOSE THIS WORK Growing up poor with an addicted, single-parent father, my childhood goal was to escape and live a life of comfort. But later, before law school, I felt called to return to the places and people I was running from. Being married to a woman of color for over 30 years, and raising our sons, has also reinforced my sense of mission and commitment.\n\nAparna Bhattacharyya\n\nExecutive Director\n\nRaksha, Inc.\n\nAparna Bhattacharyya is the executive director of Raksha, Inc. The mission of Rashka, which means protection in several South Asian languages, is to promote a stronger and healthier South Asian community through confidential support services, education, and advocacy. Having served as executive director since 1998, Bhattacharyya built the organizationâs capacity from a volunteer-run, grassroots organization to a nationally known full-service agency providing counseling, legal advocacy, economic empowerment, training, and technical assistance locally and nationally. Additionally, she increased the organizationâs budget by over 400 percent. As a representative of Raksha, Bhattacharyya has served as a founding task force member and board secretary for the International Womenâs House, the only shelter in the nation to serve battered women and children of all nationalities, supported by a multicultural and multilingual staff. A member of the Leadership Atlanta class of 2010, Bhattacharyya was honored as a White House Champion of Change in 2013.\n\nEDUCATION Georgia State University\n\nHOMETOWN Atlanta\n\nStephanie Cho\n\nDirector, Democracy Lab South\n\nAsian Americans Advancing JusticeâAtlanta\n\nFormerly the executive director of Asian Americans Advancing JusticeâAtlanta, Stephanie Cho leads Democracy Lab South, an initiative from AAAJA, the organization which advocates for the civil and human rights of Asian Americans in Georgia and the Southeast. Her project is focused on environmental justice work in Atlanta and AAPI political power building in a few other southern states. Bringing more than 20 years of experience in labor and community organizing, strategic planning, and fundraising at the local and national levels, Cho was previously the Los Angeles director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, where she worked to raise industry standards and wages for LAâs restaurant workers.
