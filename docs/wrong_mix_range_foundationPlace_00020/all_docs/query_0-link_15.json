Why is history important?\n\nIf you are looking to homeschool your elementary- or middle-aged child, let us help. With our comprehensive, memorization-based Foundations Curriculum, parents and tutors work with children to build a solid understanding across the core literacies and subject areas—history, science, English, geography, math, and Latin. All through a Christian worldview.\n\nFoundations Cycles\n\nThe homeschool material taught in Foundations is divided into three cycles: one cycle per year, for three years. Children who begin Foundations in K4 will complete each cycle at least twice, developing greater understanding and mastery through repetition. However, children at any age will benefit from learning the memory work, even if they only complete one cycle.\n\nSince cycles aren’t related to a particular grade level, families may begin in any cycle at any time. Sixth graders cover the same grammar as kindergarteners and are encouraged to cover the material in greater depth at home."
