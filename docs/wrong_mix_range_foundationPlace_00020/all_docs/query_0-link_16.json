We selected the tunnel for Door #1 a few reasons. Most importantly, Krog is an active street art location and we hoped this project would be one other artists would respond to in some way. In 2014, we first painted the hashtag #TinyDoorsATL by this door hoping people would upload photos to social media as a way to document not only the door itself, but also an active response to the door.\n\nPeople noticed the door, and to our surprise, began leaving tiny gifts on the stoop. A very small to-go box from a popular neighborhood restaurant, The Flying Biscuit, appeared on the doorʼs front porch. A tiny Atlanta Journal-Constitution left by Scoop Callahan documented the buffing of the tunnel. A miniature pumpkin appeared around Halloween. FAFATL artists began using the door as a drop site for art. We were thrilled!\n\nYears later, Door 1 has evolved to a new spot on Wylie Street as a part of our Atlanta Beltline Summer Exhibition! The design reflects the architecture of the Krog Tunnel, honoring the original location. It also features a tiny tiny door that represents a long-running collaboration with artists Lotus Eaters Club.\n\nTo watch the TINY Tiny Door come to life:\n\n1. Download \"lotus eaters club\" app on Google play or iTunes\n\n2. Choose Tiny Doors ATL\n\n3. Aim at door or sticker and watch all four animations currently available.\n\nTo see Door 1 for yourself, look between the two murals on Wylie Street that were created in conjunction with Forward, Warrior!! Mural Project and Art on the Atlanta BeltLine. This location is only 100 yards from the door’s original spot!\n\nShout out to our friends who painted the murals on either side: Lela Brunet Raymond (@lelabrunetart) on the left and Janice Rago (@janiceragoart) on the right!\n\nDoor #2: Old Fourth Ward Skatepark on the BeltLine\n\nNovember 2014\n\nWe selected a very active pedestrian area for Door #2, the Freedom Parkway overpass by the O4W Skatepark. Although the mirrors around the door remain, the original door #2 has actually been completely removed and replaced due to damage. The rainbow was added after the door’s original construction in honor of Atlanta PRIDE, and the rainbow has become our longest running design (even inspiring our logo!)\n\nAs part of our Summer Exhibition with Art on the Beltline, we are excited to introduce augmented reality features to Door 2! Follow along on Instagram to try it out.\n\nTo see Door 2 for yourself, parking is available at Old Fourth Ward Skate Park - 830 Willoughby Way NE, Atlanta, GA 30312. Once there, head across the field to the overpass along the Beltline!\n\nDoor #3: Inman Park Pet Works\n\nDecember 2014 – Replaced Aug. 2016\n\nSome of our favorite tagged images are of dogs in front of Tiny Doors! Door #3 is in front of a pet store called Inman Park Pet Works. This installation features a doggie door and a bulletin board for tiny announcements. We want each door to fit into its surroundings and to be a reflection of the neighborhood.\n\nOver the years, folks have left many miniature bulletins including posters for Snoop Dogg (get it?) and Blue’s Clues. Tiny animals and packages have also appeared. This door was the longest-lasting wooden door, and was replaced with a resin replica in 2018.\n\nHere's some tiny trivia- that dog butt is actually a cat butt!\n\nTo see Door 3 for yourself, visit Inman Park Pet Works at 914 Austin Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30307\n\nDoor #4: Little Shop of Stories\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nFrom the window outside of the store, you can peer into our tiny library. The book titles are from the imaginations of our tiny friends, who sponsored a book by donating to Tiny Doors ATL. The tiny library was installed in January 2018.\n\nTo see Door 4 for yourself, visit the Little Shop of Stories at 133 E Court Square # A, Decatur, GA 30030\n\nDoor #5: Stumpery Garden\n\nFebruary 2015 - Redesigned and Relocated June 2022\n\nAs part of our Summer Exhibition with Art on the Beltline, we are bringing back Tiny Door 5 in 2022! Just like the 2015 original, this door was created in partnership with Trees Atlanta, and is now being featured in their Stumpery Garden. As a Tiny Doors ATL original is evolving, we brought back the classic burnt orange color, but innovated the door by placing it into a hand-sculpted acorn, reflective of the arborous space. The augmented reality features associated with this door provide interactive ways to learn about the local tree canopy, which you can check out on Instagram!\n\nTo see Door 5 for yourself, visit the Extension Trail within the Trees Atlanta Stumpery Garden, which is off of Kirkwood AVE SE and Kenyon St SE.\n\nDoor #6: Eastside Trail\n\nMay 2015 - Redesigned and Relocated June 2022\n\nDoor 6 was originally installed in May of 2015, and it was beloved by tiny friends everywhere. After a fire at its location, Paris on Ponce, the door was retired. That is, until now! As part of our Summer Exhibition with Art on the Beltline, Door 6 is back and better than ever, in a new location with a reimagined, yet familiar, design. Along the Eastside trail featured in a custom bench by artist Ira Hill, the French inspiration and signature red color of Door 6 has returned.\n\nFun fact: at the original Door 6, a Tiny Doors themed marriage proposal took place in 2018. She said yes!\n\nTo see Door 6 for yourself, visit the section of the Eastside Trail overlooking Ponce De Leon, near Ponce City Market.\n\nDoor 7: 7 Stages Theatre\n\nOctober 2019\n\nGreeted by llamas, cake, beer, and some fantastic Tiny Friends, Door #7 has returned to Little (tiny) Five Points. Thank you @7stagesatl for helping us make our way back into Little 5! The marquee is interchangeable and we're excited to update it for upcoming shows.\n\nTo see Door 7 for yourself, visit the theatre in Little 5 Points at 1105 Euclid Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30307\n\nDoor #8: Milltown Arms Tavern\n\nDecember 2015\n\nThe culmination of our successful Brick Campaign, Door #8 is special because it features messages from over 200 individuals and businesses who donated to Tiny Doors ATL. The words engraved on the bricks range from the names of your family members and dogs to significant dates and causes. This door also reflects the surrounding colors of Cabbagetown.\n\nFun fact: One of the bricks is written in Braille, AND, if you look near the top left of the door you will even find a marriage proposal…. She said yes right in the parking lot!\n\nTo see Door 8 for yourself, visit the Tavern at 180 Carroll St SE, Atlanta, GA 30312. Look to the planters along the side of the building that complement the outdoor seating area!\n\nDoor #9: King of Pops\n\nMarch 2016\n\nThis tiny door can be found 15 feet from the famous King of Pops walkup window. It has its very own tiny sandwich board and sidewalk. The door also features a tiny mural painted by artist Chris Veal, the original painter of the larger mural on the same wall! See those chocolate stains on the sidewalk? So many tiny friends stop by every week with their melting pops that we canʼt keep the sidewalk clean! We take it as a compliment. :)\n\nTo see Door 9 for yourself, visit King of Pops at 337 Elizabeth St NE, Atlanta, GA 30307. (It’s actually just across Freedom Parkway and down the trail from Door 2!)\n\nDoor #10E: Grant Park Tree Door\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nDoor #10E is currently the only door that opens! By serendipity, this door is reminiscent of the shape of Georgia. The colors were inspired by red clay and green lichen on nearby tree branches. This door is located on the highest natural point in the city. Come check out the view!\n\nTo see Door 10E for yourself, park in the Gateway garage (759 Boulevard SE, Atlanta, GA 30308) and follow the Grant Park Trail up the hill. If you’re coming from the garage, look to the bases of trees on your right side as you reach the top of the incline!\n\nDoor #10W: Grant Park\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nDoor 10W is in Grant Park, and is designed to reflect the architecture of the Grant Park neighborhood (see the tiny transom and sunburst house number?), it was installed in September of 2016 at the invitation of residents of the neighborhood and the park itself. On ribbon cutting day it poured rain, but a troop of Girl Scouts still came out to sing us an original song they'd written about tiny doors. Such a special moment! ☔\n\nIf you visit this door on a Sunday between April and mid December, you will also find yourself at the tasty Grant Park Farmers Market!\n\nTo see Door 10W for yourself, park along Cherokee Avenue near the Milledge Fountain (574 Cherokee Ave SE, Atlanta, GA 30308) OR park in the Gateway Garage and follow walking signs to the westside of the park.\n\nDoor #11: Center for Puppetry Arts\n\nMarch 2017\n\nThis door and its tiny ramp can be found at the Center for Puppetry Arts! At Tiny Doors ATL, our mission is to create free, public, and accessible art for everyone to enjoy. When the Center for Puppetry Arts applied for a door we were excited. (I mean, Big Bird lives there!) When we found out their building is made of special stucco that can't handle adhesives, we were puzzled about how to continue until someone suggested using a mini version of the Center's iconic ramp to anchor the door. Brilliant!! We think about wheelchair and stroller accessibility when choosing door locations. What better way to show that tiny doors are for everyone than to make sure everyone can get in! Door 11 is ready whenever you are, Tiny Friends! Can you see the face in the door?\n\nTo see Door 11 for yourself, visit the Center for Puppetry Arts at 1404 Spring St NW, Atlanta, GA 30309. The door is along the iconic ramp leading up to the main entrance inside the gated parking area!\n\nDoor #12: Westside Trail\n\nSeptember 2017 - Redesigned June 2022\n\nWe are so excited to introduce the reimagined version of Door 12 as part of Art on the Beltline’s Summer Exhibition! At the core of Tiny Doors ATL is a commitment to creating installations reflective of their surrounding neighborhoods. We met with students at KIPP STRIVE and KIPP WAYS Academies to hear what young local residents had to say about their community. Their guidance is evident through this new installation, which features artistic representations of the West End neighborhood created by KIPP STRIVE students, displayed inside a classic boombox. You can enjoy the student’s artwork by interacting with our new augmented reality features, available on Instagram!\n\nTo see Door 12 for yourself, visit the section of the Westside trail that backs up to KIPP Academy at 1448 Lucile Ave SW, Atlanta, GA 30310\n\nDoor #13: Piedmont Plaza\n\nSeptember 2016 - Redesigned and Relocated June 2022\n\nAlthough it was originally installed as a temporary piece for the Atlanta Beltline, Tiny Door 13 under the Virginia Avenue Bridge quickly became a fan favorite in 2016. When the original location was renovated, the piece was retired. We are so excited that its legacy lives on in the new version of Door 13, part of our Summer Exhibition with Art on the Beltline! This reimagining reflects the original installation’s classic 6-panel door style and bright pink color. New elements include sculptural dogwood flowers inspired by its location near the entrance to Piedmont Park. (To honor the namesake, there are 13 of them!)\n\nTo see Door 13 for yourself, come from the Eastside Trail, along the Monroe street entrance.\n\nDoor #14: EAV Farmers Market\n\nJuly 12, 2018\n\nHave you played in the playground and garden in front of Tiny Door #14? We love it! We try to feature something new and interactive at every door. A living garden felt perfect for the East Atlanta Farmers Market! The reveal of this door coincided with our FOURTH birthday! Karen Anderson Singer, the Director of Tiny Doors ATL, was caught by surprise during the party and given a Tiny Key to the City by Representative Natalyn Archibong! Atlanta, you are the best.\n\nTo see Door 14 for yourself, visit the East Atlanta Village Farmers Market at 572 Stokeswood Ave SE, Atlanta, GA 30316.\n\nDoor #15: Fox Theatre\n\nNovember 2018\n\nFor years we've dreamed of installing a door at Atlanta's historic Fox Theater. A landmark in ATL art culture since the late 1920s, \"The Fox\" as it's called by locals even unknowingly hosted Prince's final concert. Sponsored by the Atlanta Ballet and located on the building's iconic box office, installing Door #15 at such an important ATL landmark was a dream come true. Our goal was to respect and reflect the space, adding something as close to worthy as we could get!\n\nFun fact: There’s an exact replica of this door in the green room backstage. The stairs below it have a worn-in backstage feel instead of the marble staircase. The door is often shared to Instagram and twitter by talent performing at the Fox.\n\nTo see Door 15 for yourself, look to the box office at the Fox - 660 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30308\n\nDoor #16: State Farm Arena\n\nApril 2019\n\nTiny Door #16 is between the \"T\" and the \"L\" on the front face of State Farm Arena. Although this new door is on the massive arena, it's still free to visit, public, wheelchair and public transit accessible, and made for absolutely everyone to enjoy. Thank you to the @atlhawks for believing in this tiny project, and helping to bring this dream to life.\n\nTo see Door 16 for yourself, look between the letters of the giant “Atlanta” face of the arena at 1 State Farm Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303\n\nTiny Door 17: Woodruff Park\n\nAugust 2019\n\nThe Woodruff Park door was designed to reflect the angles of the skyline and the green space of @woodruffpark. We're so excited to share it with you! Thank you to Woodruff Park and Atlanta's Department of Parks for the opportunity to design a door for this epic location!\n\nTo see Door 17 for yourself, enter Woodruff Park near the International Peace Fountain (89 Park Pl NE, Atlanta, GA 30303) and look along the bottom of the structure!\n\nDoor 18: Atlanta Symphony Orchestra\n\nSeptember 2019\n\nThis tiny door has plenty of keys and took about 55 hours to create, including 15 hours on the 40 sq ft mural. Thank you @janiceragoart for fantastic mural assistance! Symphony musicians and visitors alike will pass Door 18 on their way to Symphony Hall at the @woodruffartscenter. The door is also higher than most, so that it's easy to reach for folks in fancy symphony outfits and wheelchair accessible as always.\n\nTo see Door 18 for yourself, visit the Woodruff Arts Center (1280 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30309) and head outside, near the main entrance to Symphony Hall. There is a parking garage on the property!\n\nDoor 20 : Kirkwood\n\nAugust 2020\n\nTiny Door 20 happily captures the essence of the Kirkwood neighborhood! Including classic elements such as train tracks and faux stone, we are so happy with how this door came together! Thank you to the Kirkwood Neighbors Association and the Park Pride Community Building Grant funded by the Home Depot Foundation for bringing this door to life with us.\n\nFun Fact: The color of Door 20 was determined by Kirkwood neighbors and our Instagram followers! It was so fun to get community input, and the vote was actually so close that we found a way to incorporate the second place color, lilac, into the design as well!\n\nTo see Door 20 for yourself, visit the end of Coan Park that runs along Anniston Avenue SE\n\nDoor 21 : Atlantic Station\n\nOctober 2020\n\nLocated on the new Atlantic Green at Atlantic Station, Tiny Door 21 is just a block away from the Tiny Doors ATL Studio! We are so excited to call Atlantic Station home as its Artist in Residence. This piece reflects the Atlanta skyline and is one of our largest builds yet!\n\nTo see Door 21 for yourself, park in the Atlantic Station garage (1380 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30363) and head to the center of the commercial space to the Atlantic Green.
