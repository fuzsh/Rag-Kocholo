        "text": "Our patented helical pile, with its' ICC-ES approved design, takes your foundation stabilization project to the next level. Cantsink's professional staff has worked with contractors and engineers on new construction support, home elevation issues, utility support, and more. Our products have also been able to provide remedial support to structures that did not have proper foundational stability.\n\nHelical piles and I-beams (also known as H Beam and H Pile) are types of deep foundations used to transfer load from structures above the ground to deep suitable soil. The pile or beam soil capacity must be designed based on soil properties which are determined from soil investigation such as boring logs.\n\nHelical pile embedment depth can be approximated with some degree of accuracy which avoids any major changes/costs change during construction and delays on site."
