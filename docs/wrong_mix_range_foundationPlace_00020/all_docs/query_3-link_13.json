        "text": "Reservations are limited to one night per party and are for overnight stays only. New reservation requests for the 2024 visiting season may be submitted via email to lightningfield@diaart.org beginning on Thursday morning, February 1, 2024, at midnight (12 am) Mountain Standard Time (MST). Phone requests are not accepted.\n\nRequests must include size of party (up to 6 guests), a preferred date range, and alternate availability. Please note that Dia receives thousands of emails on February 1 at midnight and that reservations are offered in the order in which the requests land in the queue. Because demand far exceeds availability, Dia cannot guarantee every request will receive a reservation offer. If Dia is unable to offer an initial reservation, you may be placed on the waitlist for the 2024 season.\n\nOnce a date has been agreed upon, registration and payment links will be sent and must be completed to confirm the hold. Reservations are nonrefundable unless the spot is rebooked by a party on the waitlist.\n\nDue to the remote nature of the site, children under five are not allowed.\n\nDay visits, camping, and pets are not permitted.\n\nSee Cancellations section for more information.\n\nTo ensure guest and staff safety during multi-group visits in 2024, the following policies are in place for all visitors:\n\nAll visitors must comply with New Mexico state, local, and federal COVID-19 regulations current at their time of travel. To preserve guest and staff safety, please protect yourself and others from COVID-19 with the following recommendations:\n\nRemain up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines and boosters before you travel\n\nFollow CDC recommendations for masking in travel and public transportation settings\n\nConsider getting tested before travel as close to the time of departure as possible (no more than 3 days)\n\nAdditional information is available on the CDC website, accessible here.\n\nIf a guest must cancel a reservation due to a positive COVID-19 test, please notify us via email at lightningfield@diaart.org as soon as possible. Dia will refund the visitor fees upon receipt of proof of the positive test. No additional refunds for travel or other guest expenses will be provided.\n\nThe actual cost of maintaining The Lightning Field and accommodating visits greatly exceeds visitor fees. Contributions toward the operating expenses of The Lightning Field are appreciated, and donations beyond the listed rates are tax-deductible. Scroll down to the Support The Lightning Field section to make a donation.\n\nOnce a date has been secured, visitors will receive an email with a registration link and instructions for payment and confirmation.\n\nA reservation is confirmed only upon receipt of the registration form and payment in full within five days of receiving the hold email. Payment is not accepted upon arrival in Quemado, New Mexico. If you need to cancel a booking after submitting a payment, please do so as soon as possible. If a booking is canceled for reasons other than those listed under the Cancellations section below, the reservation is nonrefundable unless the spot is rebooked by a party on the waitlist.\n\nThe Lightning Field is located in a remote area in the high desert in Western New Mexico. Extreme weather events can occur that cause The Lightning Field to pause operations on short notice. Please be aware that there is a risk your visit may be cancelled on short notice if we cannot safely access the visitor cabin due to such events. If your visit is cancelled due to extreme weather, Dia can attempt to rebook you later in the season (though we cannot guarantee availability), rebook your visit for the following season, or you can request a refund. No additional refund for cost of travel or other expenses will be provided.\n\nThe Lightning Field operations may be paused on short notice due to changes in COVID-19 or other health and safety regulations from New Mexico state, local, or federal governments or in the case of a known COVID-19 exposure among staff or visitors. If Dia pauses operations due to health concerns, the cost of your stay will be refunded or your visit will be rebooked. No additional refund for cost of travel or other expenses will be provided.\n\nIn the event that a visitor must cancel their reservation due to reasons other than those noted above, please email lightningfield@diaart.org as soon as possible. Dia will make a good faith effort to rebook the visit with another party. If we can successfully rebook, visitor fees will be refunded to the original party. Please note that your reservation is nonrefundable unless we can rebook your visit with a new party. If you need to cancel, notify us as soon as possible so we can begin this process.\n\nVisits must be overnight, from May 1 to October 31, 2024.\n\nA visitor cabin adjacent to The Lightning Field provides shelter and simple meals during the overnight stay. Due to the remote nature of the site, children under five are not allowed.\n\nA Dia staff driver will greet visitors at the Dia office in Quemado and transport them to and from the cabin at The Lightning Field for their reservation.\n\nThe cabin has three bedrooms and can accommodate up to six guests (two bedrooms with two twin beds each, and one bedroom with a double bed). There are two bathrooms with showers, a fully appointed kitchen, and a common room. Linens and blankets are provided, and the cabin is connected to all utilities, including water and electricity.\n\nDia hosts multiple groups in the cabin. When requesting a reservation, visitors should keep in mind their comfort level in sharing the kitchen, bathroom, and common spaces. Specific bedrooms may not be requested or reserved.\n\nMeals are provided with all reservations. A simple supper is prepared and left with heating instructions along with a selection of breakfast items to prepare the next morning. For special dietary requirements, visitors are welcome to bring other food and beverage items.\n\nVisitors are asked to refrain from bringing loud electronic devices or anything that may disturb other visitors.\n\nCamping and day visits are not permitted.\n\nPets are not allowed.\n\nVisitors must arrive in Quemado no later than 2 pm on the day of the visit. Upon confirmation of the reservation and payment, visitors will receive driving instructions to the location, which is an approximately three-hour drive from Albuquerque. There is no public transportation available between Albuquerque and Quemado.\n\nVisitors will check in at Dia’s Quemado office, located in a white two-story building on the north side of the town’s main street. Transportation from Quemado to the site is provided by Dia and takes 45 minutes. Visitors will leave their vehicle parked outside the office. The following day, Dia will drop off visitors in Quemado at approximately 12 pm.\n\nIt is important that visitors meet this schedule, as off-schedule trips cannot be accommodated. If arriving from Arizona, please note that during the summer months, New Mexico’s time is one hour later than Arizona’s time.\n\nDaytime trips and short visits cannot be accommodated. The Lightning Field may only be viewed through an overnight visit.\n\nLocated in the high desert at an elevation of 7,200 feet, The Lightning Field is situated on a flat plain. Depending on the time of day and month, the weather ranges from 30 to 90 degrees. The terrain is generally flat but can be rough or muddy depending on weather conditions, and there are no improved trails. Visitors should be prepared to walk over flat but rough terrain and should bring a pair of sturdy walking shoes or boots. We also recommend sunglasses, a hat, sunscreen, layers for varying temperatures, insect repellant, a raincoat/windbreaker, and a water bottle.\n\nAlthough lightning storms typically occur in this area from mid-July through August and may also occur at other times during the visiting season, the probability of lightning during your visit cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Lightning Field is located in a very remote part of western New Mexico. Health care facilities are not available locally, with the nearest hospitals located about a two-hour journey from the cabin location. There is no Wi-Fi or internet service at the cabin, and cellular service is extremely limited. Please be prepared for a remote experience and carefully plan your communications, attire, and food supplies (if needed to supplement what is provided)."
