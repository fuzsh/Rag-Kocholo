        "text": "How will you be prepared to be a DCAA auditor?\n\nOur unparalleled, focused training program sets us apart. As a new auditor, you’ll receive in-depth professional training from DCAA’s Defense Contract Audit Institute (DCAI), along with on-the-job training at your assigned DCAA location.\n\nInitial Auditor Training at DCAI\n\nDCAI training includes initial instructor-led courses onsite at DCAI in Atlanta, Georgia, self-study e-learning courses, and blended learning across the U.S. for some advanced courses.\n\nDCAA has a formal, structured program for new auditors called the New Hire Continuum. In your first 6 months with DCAA, you will complete several required courses at DCAI, along with focused training for your identified needs.\n\nNew Hire Onboarding: Orientation begins at DCAI on your first day as a DCAA employee.\n\nThe first week provides an introduction to the Agency. You’ll meet the cohort of new employees who go through training with you, receive HR training, and enroll in benefits. You’ll also receive your laptop and CAC (Common Access Card), a smart ID card that allows you access to DCAA facilities and computer systems.\n\nThe second week dives into an introduction to audit concepts and contract auditing.\n\nFollowing this initial training, you’ll report to your assigned office, meet your supervisor and teammates, and gain further orientation and guidance. You will return periodically to DCAI during your first six months to complete the courses summarized below.\n\nâBasic Contract Audit Skills: You’ll complete this two-week course 6-8 weeks after the onboarding program. It covers basic concepts, techniques, and procedures of DCAA contract auditing, and introduces Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and audit criteria requirements. It also explains the end-to-end audit process and the importance of effective communication with our stakeholders.\n\nAudit Applications: You’ll complete this two-week course about 60 days following the Basic Contract Audit Skills course. It prepares new auditors to apply basic audit methods to plan and conduct both incurred cost and forward pricing audits.\n\nAdditional Mandatory Training\n\nDuring your second and third year of service with DCAA, you must complete several additional required courses through DCAI, and a Defense Acquisition University (DAU) course on Fundamentals of Systems Acquisition Management. You will also be able to choose among elective courses to fulfill additional focused training requirements (i.e., courses that prepare you for your specific job responsibilities).\n\nEvery new auditor must also achieve the following required job certifications and compliance, which are incorporated into DCAI’s internal and external learning plans.\n\nDoD Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) Certification – This certification supports an agile and high-performing military and civilian workforce that meets eligibility criteria, makes smart business decisions, acts ethically, and delivers timely and affordable capabilities to the Warfighter.\n\nDoD Financial Management (FM) Certification – This certification supports the professional development of the FM workforce and provides a framework for a standard body of knowledge. DCAI maintains FM certification for all of its auditors and several other job classifications included in the FM program.\n\nGenerally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) Certification - All courses and certifications help ensure compliance with GAGAs requirements.\n\nThese certifications assure auditing compliance, provide you with the knowledge and skills required for contract auditing, and greatly enhance your professional development and marketability.\n\nOpportunities Beyond Initial Training"
