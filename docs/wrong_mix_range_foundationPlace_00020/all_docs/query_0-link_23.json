The Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center is where innovative conferences thrive and business and sophistication meet. In the heart of Atlanta’s vibrant Technology Square, the only hotel on the Georgia Tech campus offers the perfect blend of a world-class conference center with the style and convenience of a chic city center hotel. We’re just moments from the Georgia World Congress Center and premier attractions, shopping, dining and nightlife.\n\nFully wired for business and steps from the Georgia Tech academic and administration buildings and athletic facilities, our hotel is ideally positioned for Atlanta GA corporate travelers and visiting Georgia Tech families, alumni and friends.\n\nMy favorite part of working with the GA Tech hotel, apart from your staff, is the flexibility you offer to your clients:\n\n- Last minute requests are implemented quickly\n\n- There is no bureaucracy or red tape. I feel like your entire staff is easily accessible in the planning process.\n\n- Small requests do not amount to a \"surprise invoice\" At the end of the event. I can tell you how refreshing this is.\n\nHats off the chef. This is the only conference we run in the entire world where I don't get one complaint about the food. Rather our attendees rave about it. In an industry where you can't please everyone, your chef has managed to do so."
