        "text": "Why should I replace missing teeth?\n\nYour appearance is one reason. Another is that the gap left by a missing tooth can mean more strain is put on the teeth at either side.\n\nA gap can also mean your ‘bite' is affected, because the teeth next to the space can lean into the gap and change the way the upper and lower teeth bite together. This can then lead to food getting packed into the gap, which causes tooth decay and gum disease.\n\nHow are missing teeth replaced?\n\nThis depends on the number of teeth missing and on where they are in your mouth. The condition of the teeth you still have also affects the decision.\n\nThere are three main ways to replace missing teeth. The first is with a removable false tooth (or teeth) - called a partial denture. The second is with a fixed bridge. A bridge is usually used when there are fewer teeth to replace, or when the missing teeth are only on one side of the mouth. The third way is by the use of dental ‘implants'. This is where an artificial root is placed into the bone of the jaw and a crown or bridge placed on top of this. See our leaflet ‘Tell me about: dental implants'.\n\nWhat is a partial denture?\n\nThis is a plate with one or more false teeth on it. It may be all plastic or a mixture of metal and plastic. Both types may have clips (clasps) to help keep the denture in place in your mouth. Depending on where they are, some of these clips may show when you smile or open your mouth.\n\nWhat is the difference between a plastic partial denture and one that contains metal?\n\nPlastic partial dentures are less expensive to make. But unless they are designed very carefully they can damage the teeth they fit against.\n\nMetal partial dentures are usually made from an alloy of cobalt and chromium, and they are much stronger. They are lighter to wear and can be supported by the remaining teeth. Although the base is metal, they have gum-coloured plastic and natural-looking teeth fixed to them. They are more expensive than plastic ones.\n\nHow do I choose the best type for me?\n\nBe guided by your dentist. They will know the condition of your remaining teeth. In most cases a metal-based partial denture gives the best result.\n\nCan I have a bridge fitted straight after having a tooth removed?\n\nIt can take up to 6 months for your gums to heal properly after an extraction. This means that you may need to have a temporary denture before the bridge is fitted.\n\nHow do I look after my denture?\n\nDentures may break if you drop them. Always clean your denture over a bowl of water or a folded towel in case you drop it.\n\nTo clean your dentures, the general rule is: brush and soak every day. Brush your dentures first, to help remove any bits of food. Use a non-abrasive denture cleaner, not toothpaste. Be careful not to scrub too hard as this may cause grooves in the surface.\n\nMake sure you brush all the surfaces of the dentures, including the surface that fits against your gums. This is especially important if you use any kind of denture fixative.\n\nSoak your dentures every day in a denture-cleaning solution. This will help remove any plaque and stubborn stains that are left. It will also help to disinfect your dentures, leaving them feeling fresher. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nDon't keep your dentures in overnight unless there are specific reasons for you to keep them in.\n\nIf you notice a build-up of stains or scale, have your denture cleaned by your dental team.\n\nShould I take my denture out at night?\n\nYour dental team may recommend taking out your dentures at night to give your mouth a chance to rest. If you do this, it is important to leave it in water to prevent any warping or cracking.\n\nWhat is the alternative to a partial denture?\n\nThe main alternatives are a fixed bridge or a dental implant. A dental bridge is made by putting crowns on the teeth at either side of the gap, and then joining these two crowns together by placing a false tooth in the space. This is all made in the laboratory and then the pieces are cemented into place with special adhesives. The bridge can't be removed.\n\nAnother option is an adhesive bridge. This has ‘wings' that are bonded to the back of the supporting teeth, with very little drilling needed.\n\nCan I always have a bridge to replace missing teeth?\n\nThe cost will vary depending on the size and type of bridge you need. Always get a written estimate and treatment plan before starting any dental treatment. Although a bridge may seem expensive it should last many years.\n\nHow do I look after my bridge?\n\nYou need to clean your bridge every day, to prevent problems such as bad breath and gum disease. You also have to clean under the false tooth every day. Your dentist or hygienist will show you how to use a bridge needle or special floss, as a normal toothbrush cannot reach.\n\nAre there other methods for fixing false teeth?\n\nThere are other methods, such as using a combination of crowns and partial dentures that can keep the retaining clips out of sight. These are quite specialised dentures, so you should ask your dental team about them.\n\nCan I have teeth which attach to the jawbone?\n\nYes, by having implants. This treatment means you may be able to replace missing teeth without having crowns on other teeth. Click here for more information about dental implants. Remember that it is as important to care for your remaining teeth as it is to replace the missing ones.\n\nPeople who viewed this page also visited...\n\nDental implants\n\nGum disease\n\nTooth decay"
