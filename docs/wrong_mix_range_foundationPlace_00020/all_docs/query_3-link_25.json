In that time, homeowners are likely to see tons of houses with issues, some of which are bigger than others.\n\nOne of the most significant of these issues is foundation damage, and knowing when to walk away from foundation issues can be a real gut-check moment.\n\nFeatured Partner\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

It provides stability and keeps the living space insulated and dry from groundwater. It also anchors the home in place, keeping the structure from moving or shifting during natural disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes and tornadoes.\n\nThere are a few basic types of foundations:\n\nSlab foundations are simple concrete pads, about eight inches thick, while slab-on-grade foundations are similar but feature footings around the perimeter and under load-bearing walls.\n\nCrawl space foundations have short masonry walls around their perimeter and several footings underneath, but they do not have a finished concrete floor.\n\nFull basements are dug into the ground and feature full-height concrete walls and concrete floors.\n\nThere are other foundations as well, but they’re mostly variations of these three common types. Common materials used to build these structures include concrete blocks, bricks, poured concrete or prefabricated concrete panels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

These issues can occur for a number of reasons, including poorly prepared concrete or site work and excessive groundwater. The following are some of the most common foundation issues.\n\nCracks\n\nFoundation cracks are extremely common with masonry structures of all sorts and can occur during the curing process, but if they’re small, they’re rarely an issue. Large cracks can allow water to penetrate the basement or let pests sneak in.\n\nLeaks\n\nOne of a foundation’s main jobs is to keep water out of the home, and groundwater leaking from under the slab or penetrating the walls is a common issue. This can lead to increased humidity in the basement, causing mold and mildew while also attracting bugs and pests.\n\nSinking\n\nAll structures have to settle, but when a slab or wall is sinking, it’s an issue. This often occurs when the ground underneath the foundation wasn’t packed well, and as that dirt settles, it leaves air pockets that allow the foundation to sink over time.\n\nBowing\n\nBowing foundation walls is also common. This often occurs when the groundwater outside of the home doesn’t drain enough, placing increased amounts of hydrostatic pressure against the outside of the foundation. This pushes the walls inward, causing the walls to bow.\n\nDeterioration\n\nDeterioration is a common issue with a couple of possible causes. First, it may be a result of a poorly-prepared concrete mixture when the foundation was poured, as too much water (or not enough) can cause a weak bond between the mixture.\n\nAnother common cause is frozen water. While freezing water generally cracks masonry, small amounts of water that penetrates the concrete, freezes, and thaws can cause deterioration and crumbling.\n\nNote: Many folks wonder, “can a house collapse from foundation issues?” The truth is yes, a house can eventually collapse from foundation issues. However, this usually takes many years, and a homeowner can usually catch their issue in time. Left on their own, foundation issues can cause structural collapse, so it’s best to handle these problems as soon as they’re apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Home shoppers should look out for these signs, but homeowners should keep an eye out in their own homes as well.\n\nWindow and Door Issues\n\nAs a foundation issue develops, the doors and windows in the home could be the first indicator. Their opening may start to rack, or go out of the square, leaving gaps when closed, becoming difficult to operate or even opening or closing on their own.\n\nCracks in Interior and Exterior Walls\n\nFoundation walls that are shifting or sinking will experience stress, and this often results in cracking inside or outside. Small cracks are normal, but large cracks spell trouble, as they will allow groundwater and pests to penetrate the wall.\n\nMold and Mildew\n\nMold and mildew are signs that the moisture in the basement is too high. This is usually the result of cracks or slab leaks, so the homeowner needs to pinpoint the problem and fix it before the mold and mildew spread throughout the house.\n\nLeaning Structures\n\nA leaning porch and a tipping chimney or fireplace can be a sign that a foundation issue is well underway. When this is the case, the structure holding these items in place is failing, and it could be due to sinking, settling or deterioration.\n\nBouncing Floors\n\nWhile not always a foundation issue, bouncing floors are cause for concern. It’s possible that a footing or beam underneath that section of floor isn’t supporting it anymore, allowing the rest of the floor to bear the weight of the joists, subfloor, and finished flooring in the area.\n\nPopping Tiles or Drywall\n\nAs a foundation fails, the home’s frame will begin to shift and rack. This can cause items installed by the builder when the house was square to pop loose. This includes floor and wall tiles, drywall nails, counters and cabinets and even trim work.\n\nWhat Are Your Options if You Have Foundation Issues?\n\nFoundation issues don’t have to be make-or-break. While they sound like a death sentence for a home (and an impending sale), there are options.\n\nFor Small Issues\n\nFirst, small issues like cracks and moisture can be repaired rather quickly, and they may not cause any issues with financing. Home shoppers should consider bringing these issues to the seller’s attention, though, as they may be able to negotiate for a lower price on the house.\n\nFor Large Issues\n\nLarge issues, such as significant sinking or deterioration, may be an issue. The homeowner will probably have to fix these issues before selling the home. Luckily, many of these foundation problems are repairable through processes like slab jacking (injecting material under the slab to lift it in place), standard brick or block replacement, or pouring new footings.\n\nThe final option is to walk away from the foundation issue, and this may be the best move in some cases.\n\nThe Cost of Foundation Repairs\n\nThe average range for foundation repairs is between $2,200 on the low end and $7,500 on the high end, with a national average of around $4,750. However, it’s important to note that the cost of the repair will vary greatly depending on the cause and extent of the damage.\n\nSmall cracks and waterproofing may cost just a few hundred dollars to repair, which is well below the average range. However, slab jacking and intense excavation can cost well north of the average range.\n\nTo arrive at the average costs in this article, we surveyed four national cost databases. All averaged figures were correct at the time of publication and may be subject to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Most foundation issues can be repaired, but there are instances where it’s better to withdraw your offer and keep searching.\n\nIf there are foundation issues and you’re considering moving forward with the purchase, it will be important to have a professional masonry contractor or structural engineer examine the damage. They’ll be able to detail what likely needs to be done to repair it, as well as offer a price range for the repair.\n\nOnce you have a professional assess the foundation, you’ll have a better idea of whether it’s a smart move. Instances of when it’s time to take your checkbook elsewhere include:\n\nWhen the repair will cost more than the seller is willing to take off the price of the house.\n\nWhen the repairs will take longer than you’re willing to wait to move into the house.\n\nIf you’re using a government-backed mortgage program, as they will require the repair to be finished before financing the home.\n\nWhen the area is known for unstable soil, making the issue likely to occur again.\n\nBeyond these red flags, it may be worth following through with the offer.
