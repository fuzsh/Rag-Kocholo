While some hairline cracks might be harmless, larger or growing cracks could indicate a serious issue. This guide will explain how to tell the difference—and what to do about cracks in your home’s foundation walls or concrete slab.\n\nWhat Are Foundation Cracks?\n\nFoundation cracks are one of the most common foundation problems. They are fissures or breaks that appear in a home’s foundation walls or concrete slab.\n\nNot all foundation cracks are cause for concern. The natural curing process of concrete can cause hairline cracks—less than 1/8 inch wide—to appear in the first few years after a home is built. However, larger cracks and those that grow over time could indicate a serious structural issue. Here are a few examples of foundational movement:\n\nSettlement: Downward movement of the foundation\n\nUplift: Upward movement of the foundation\n\nRotation: Movement of foundation walls either inward or outward\n\nBulging: Part of the foundation wall protrudes outward from the rest of the wall.\n\nIf you notice new or expanding cracks in your home’s foundation, it’s worth paying for a foundation inspection. Hire a structural engineer or other qualified professional to evaluate the cause and severity of the cracks, and complete any recommended repairs as soon as possible. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent further damage.\n\nWhat Are Problems with Different Types of Foundations?\n\nDifferent types of foundations can have unique problems. Knowing your foundation type and materials will help you make an educated assessment of any foundation cracks and decide when to call in a professional.\n\nWhat Are Common Causes of Foundation Cracks?\n\nMost foundation cracks are caused by soil movement. However, natural disasters and construction problems can also play a role. Here’s a complete list of possible causes:\n\nConstruction additions: Adding significant weight to your home through extensions or renovations can put additional stress on the foundation.\n\nFrost heave: In freezing climates, water in the soil expands when it turns to ice, pushing upwards and potentially lifting or shifting the foundation.\n\nImproper grading: If the land around your home slopes towards the foundation, it can cause water to pool and increase the soil pressure.\n\nMoisture fluctuations: Drought and flooding—or even excess water from poor drainage—can cause the soil to expand or contract, putting stress on the foundation.\n\nPlumbing issues: Leaky sewer or water lines can saturate the soil and trigger foundation movement.\n\nPoor soil composition: Clay-rich soils are particularly prone to expansion and contraction, increasing the risk of foundation cracks.\n\nSeismic activity: Earthquakes can cause significant stress on foundations, leading to cracks or more serious damage.\n\nTree roots: As tree roots grow, they can exert pressure on the foundation, causing cracks and displacement.\n\nFree Quote: Get your quote on foundation repair today\n\nConcrete Slab Cracks Vs. Foundation Wall Cracks\n\nWhile both concrete slab cracks and foundation wall cracks may appear concerning, their significance and underlying causes differ. Here’s what homeowners should know about each:\n\nConcrete Slab Cracks\n\nSome homes are built on a horizontal concrete slab. Hairline cracks that haven’t changed in size, do not allow in water, and show no vertical displacement are often cosmetic and require no immediate action. In areas with extreme temperature variations, cracks may form as the slab expands and contracts.\n\nWide cracks, growing cracks, or cracks accompanied by other signs of a foundation problem may warrant a professional inspection. These cracks may be caused by uneven settling of the soil beneath the slab, moisture fluctuations, poor soil compaction, or tree root growth.\n\nFoundation Wall Cracks\n\nMany homes have foundation walls rather than a concrete slab. Cracks may appear in these walls due to seismic activity or poor construction. Uneven settlement or water pressure from the surrounding soil can also put stress on the foundation walls.\n\nEven seemingly minor cracks in foundation walls require professional assessment. They are much more likely to indicate a serious structural issue than the cracks that appear in concrete slabs. Depending on the severity and cause, repairs might involve crack injections, underpinning, wall reinforcement, or more extensive interventions.\n\nHow Much Does it Cost to Fix Foundation Cracks?\n\nThe cost to fix a foundation crack depends on the cause and severity of the issue, as well as the type of foundation you have. Hairline cracks can cost as little as $250* to repair with epoxy or polyurethane foam. Larger cracks are more serious but may still only cost about $800 to fix. You can see one method of fixing concrete foundation cracks in the video below:\n\nIf the cracks turn out to be merely one symptom of a bigger foundation problem, you could end up paying thousands of dollars. Replacing or repairing a severely damaged foundation can cost $20,000 or more. A structural report alone costs $300–$1,000. For wet cracks, you may also need invest in a drainage system ($2,800–$6,500) and/or waterproofing ($2,000–$6,000).\n\nFree Quote: Get your quote on foundation repair today\n\n*Costs are sourced from contractor estimates used by Angi, as updated in November 2023.\n\nIs Fixing Cracks in Concrete Worth it?\n\nEvaluating foundation problems can be challenging, even for professionals who see them every day. While some cracks can be ignored, others will require time and money to resolve the issue. Remember, the general guidelines in this article are not a substitute for professional training and experience.\n\nIf you are concerned about a foundation problem, we recommend calling a professional, such as a structural engineer. The cost to repair a foundation typically increases the longer you wait, so the recommendation is to fix them sooner rather than later.\n\nFAQs About Foundation Cracks"
