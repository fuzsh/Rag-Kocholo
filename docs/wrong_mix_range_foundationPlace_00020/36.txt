Connecting people who care

with causes that matter

Everything we do centers around one purpose – improving our world through the power of philanthropy

We believe in the power of a connected, giving community.

That’s why, for more than 30 years, the Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia has connected people who care with causes that matter. Together we can improve our world!

Discover more about who the Community Foundation is, our vision to improve our world through the power of philanthropy, and what we do that impacts our communities!

Every single individual that we’ve been introduced to through the Community Foundation, whether Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta or Good Samaritan Health Center of Gwinnett, or other folks we’ve met along the way, are all tremendous organizations and individuals. We love everything going on at the Community Foundation!
