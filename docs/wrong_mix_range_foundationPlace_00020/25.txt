Historic Marietta is located a short drive from downtown Atlanta but feels a world away with five National Register historic districts and nearby Kennesaw Mountain. The thriving downtown has locally owned restaurants, shops, and art galleries as well as a popular year-round weekend farmers market. History buffs can't miss the museums, including one devoted to "Gone With the Wind." Start your trip at the Marietta Welcome Center, located in an old Western & Atlantic Railroad Passenger Depot.

Earl and Rachel Smith Strand Theatre

The 1935 Art Deco Earl and Rachel Smith Strand Theatre is perhaps the most iconic building in Marietta, which operated as a movie theater until 1976. It sat vacant for years before being restored to its former glory, now hosting classic films, concerts, stage productions and special events. The terrace has a bar that overlooks the square.

William Root House Museum and Gardens

One of the oldest homes in the Atlanta area, the Root House is more typical of its time and place than the columned mansions popularized by Gone With the Wind. Though the home and grounds have been meticulously restored to their 1860 appearance, modern touchscreens and interactive displays have been added to help tell the story of the Root family and their enslaved house servants.
