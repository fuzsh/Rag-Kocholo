I have had two sons at Imhotep who are 14 years apart. I knew with my second child that IA was the place for him. It is a nurturing place that fosters creativity and discipline and prepares our children to be successful in and increasingly challenging world.

"A true gem on the cultural landscape of Atlanta!!! You’d be hard-pressed to find a school where the teachers care as much for your child as they do at Imhotep Academy. If you want a culturally relevant, truly caring experience for your child, you must consider Imhotep. They offer an invaluable life experience at a very affordable price. I can’t emphasize enough how well cared for our daughter was by both teachers AND administrators. This school is truly a blessing to the city of Atlanta."
