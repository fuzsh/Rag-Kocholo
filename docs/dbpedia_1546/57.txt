GoldenSource, a provider of enterprise data management (EDM) solutions for the securities and investment industry, reports the integration of its EDM platform with Avox Ltd.’s Web-based application programming interfaces (APIs).

Avox, which provides Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) standard reference data, recently launched a series of Web-based APIs for LEIs, legal names, addresses, industry classifications and corporate hierarchies, according to a GoldenSource statement.

GoldenSource’s integration with these services will enable clients to “bring legal entity data into the GoldenSource platform on a real-time basis. In addition, clients will be able to acquire Avox data held on their entities of interest on a request/response basis and then access and manage this data within GoldenSource’s EDM platform,” according to the statement. “The integration will facilitate client on-boarding and counterparty data management as well as help firms to satisfy regulatory requirements.”

The new service will “add value to trading, operations, risk and compliance areas of both buy-side and sell-side institutions,” says Neill Vanlint, global managing director of GoldenSource.

Avox is a wholly owned subsidiary of the DTCC.
