        "text": "Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\n\nNot half as wonderful as foresight, though. As the man said (and he should know), “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get”. In other words, investment in your commercial and technological future is worth every penny and more.\n\nIn this look at 2024’s onrushing tech juggernaut, we’ll uncover the trends, strategies and technologies that separate industry leaders from followers and help steer your bank toward a prosperous and competitive future. From the continued evolution of Al-driven chatbots and personalized customer experiences to enhanced security and efficiency, we’ll look at how technology is reshaping the core operations of banks and the financial industry itself.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nData is the new currency. Consequently, cybersecurity and safeguarding customer information will remain front of mind as banks battle increasingly sophisticated threats.\n\nThe combined force of data analytics and generative Al is revolutionizing risk assessment, fraud detection and omnichannel transactions. With its ability to generate predictive models and unearth valuable insights buried in vast datasets, AI and advanced analytics will empower decision-makers to make even better, real-time choices.\n\nTake care of your customers\n\nElsewhere, machine learning (ML) is establishing hyper-personalization and targeting as core services. With ML, banks see customers as individuals, offering them tailored financial products and recommendations, and increasing user satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAutomation — the watchword for efficiency — streamlines manual and other routine tasks, from transaction processing to customer support, freeing human resources for more strategic activities that require creativity and empathy.\n\nPutting down a marker\n\nEmbracing emerging technologies enables banks to do more than simply survive. And Luxoft can help you thrive in financial markets where agility, insight and innovation are table stakes.\n\nIt’s your future. Make the most of it.\n\nBanking market overview\n\nThe banking and capital markets industry will face shifting market dynamics, and fundamental and disruptive business model challenges.\n\nAs customers become more open to having their banking requirements provided by non-financial institutions, the pace and intensity of competition against new and traditional rivals will rocket.\n\nKey technology trends for 2024\n\n1. Customer engagement and experience\n\n2. Open banking and ecosystem\n\n3. Cards and payments\n\n4. Product and capability innovation\n\n5. Emerging technology\n\nGenerative AI is acknowledged to be one of the most important and transformative technologies for 2024. The technology brings many benefits and a sharper competitive edge, but banks must be careful when using it.\n\nThe banking BPS market is expected to reach $9.5 billion–$9.7 billion in 2024\n\nCelent expects IT spending to reach $274.4 billion, an increase of 5.0% on 2023\n\nOver 80% of institutions increased IT budgets in 2023, and 85% are planning increases for 2024\n\nCorporate banking technology trends\n\nCorporate banking 2024: Key stats\n\n70%\n\nof banks say, \"It’s more challenging to win and retain customers than it was 12 months ago\"\n\n52%\n\nof banks say, \"greater speed and agility\" is a top priority for solution delivery\n\n83%\n\nof banks rank \"corporate digital channels and trade services/SCF\" as top investment priorities\n\n61%\n\nof banks prioritized advanced analytics, AI and ML as top priorities\n\n5.6%\n\nThe global average by which banks expect their IT budgets to increase in 2024\n\nSource: Celent - Technology Trends Previsory Corporate Banking 2024\n\nPrime technology trends for corporate banking 2024\n\nSource: Celent - Technology Trends Previsory Corporate Banking 2024\n\nCustomer engagement and experience\n\nEnhanced onboarding will accelerate in 2024. A digital onboarding experience cuts time-to-revenue and drives the adoption of digital channels from the outset. One bank reimagined its corporate onboarding with a concept of “moments that matter” to clients and the relationship/servicing teams\n\nDigital channel investments focus on the digital experience or “the consumerization of corporate banking,” including alternative access methods, personalization and embedded servicing capabilities\n\nBanks will also use digital tools and analytics to enrich client engagement. While modernizing CRM platforms, banks should consider the following as a connected strategy supported by an integrated data and analytics platform:\n\nDigitally engaged relationship managers\n\nBeyond CRM — relationship analytics and advisory\n\nIntelligent contact center\n\nOpen banking and ecosystem\n\nWhether via open banking, embedded finance or banking as-a-Service (BaaS), 75% of banks worldwide said they have a clear engagement strategy for the open ecosystem. Fintechs and small banks entering the BaaS and embedded finance markets have grabbed the innovation headlines for years. Now, major banks with larger innovation budgets and robust risk frameworks are fighting back\n\nBanks offering banking as-a-Service for digital B2B markets and platforms (allowing the buying and selling of products for multiple vendors) will enable a marketplace to leverage a bank’s license and secure payments network to incorporate financial services into their offerings\n\nU.S. regulators have established supervisory programs for the safe development of banking innovation and fintech partnerships. Banks must adopt strong risk frameworks with partners and proactively engage regulators where necessary\n\nCards and payments\n\nBanks face challenges on multiple payment fronts — compliance programs, rising costs and revenue pressure, etc. — as well as opportunities to differentiate. Making meaningful rather than incremental improvements will be vital\n\nISO 20022 is the future, with financial messaging projects in virtually every payment type and country. Banks must implement changes ASAP to derive the full benefit for themselves and their clients\n\nAI applications are deployed throughout the payment life cycle. Banks must clarify the beneficiary (bank or client) to avoid conflicts of interest\n\nInnovation will flourish with new forms of money that banks need to rationalize rapidly, establishing which provide client value and how to incorporate them into client propositions\n\nProduct and capability innovation\n\nBank and third-party small-business banking data can deliver actionable insights to customers and accelerate employees as trusted advisors. Efficient journeys mean focusing on customer-centric workflows across the supply chain, i.e., beyond traditional banking. It also means facilitating financial management by delivering basic alerts, insights and so on\n\nTrade services: In 2023, the market dynamic changed for banks and corporate clients looking to maximize liquidity and reduce credit exposure. The global supply chain problems increased inefficiency. Banks face an ever-changing technology landscape as fintechs and pioneering banks develop new value propositions and services\n\nBank clients want enhanced data-oriented capabilities to improve treasury operations and working capital. Cash management data will be transformed, acknowledging that the underlying data enables a more advisory treasury relationship\n\nEmerging technology\n\nGenerative AI is now a consumer service. What started as a global stateless currency has evolved into routine use cases. With quantum on the horizon, it’s good to begin preparing, if only for cybersecurity reasons\n\nEarly GenAI-mover banks are already progressing from exploration to PoC. GenAI will allow users to combine AI with human intelligence to enhance and expand our abilities — at base level, to generate content and get answers quickly; at a higher level, to improve decision-making, problem-solving and overall cognitive skills. However, it must be handled with care and guidance\n\nThe private sector is ahead of central banks in developing and launching digital money. With proven value in select use cases, initiatives must scale. Only a few central banks have launched CBDCs (to a lukewarm response)\n\nCorporate bankers and tech partners should initiate a quantum computing program of awareness and understanding\n\nRetail banking technology trends\n\nRetail banking 2024: Key stats\n\n75%\n\nof banks say, \"It’s more challenging to win and retain customers than it was 12 months ago\"\n\n57%\n\nof banks say, \"greater speed and agility\" is a top priority for solution delivery\n\n45%\n\nof banks say, \"digital account opening\" is a top product investment priority\n\n41%\n\nof banks are currently exploring GenAI use cases. A further 31% have products related to the technology on their 2023-2024 roadmap\n\n4.6%\n\nThe global average by which banks expect their IT budgets to increase in 2024\n\nSource: Celent - Technology Trends Previsory Corporate Banking 2024\n\nPrime technology trends for retail banking 2024\n\nSource: Celent - Technology Trends Previsory Corporate Banking 2024\n\nCustomer engagement and experience\n\nThe next evolution of retail delivery will be in hyper-personalized, valuable life and financial experiences for customers. The future is customer engagement\n\nThe difference is a shift from one-time value (“I have an auto loan at a great rate”) to continuing customer value via personalized, proactive digital engagement\n\nBanks are digitally acquiring new customers. Better onboarding is next up\n\n“We’re here for you” is no longer enough. Banks must deliver personalized value propositions through ongoing customer engagement\n\nBanks have overplayed digital’s ability to cut cost-to-serve, treating human-to-human interactions as a last resort. A more balanced model, tailored to each institution’s target market and brand promise, is needed\n\nBlended automated digital and human assistance will achieve cost savings and retention. GenAI real-time coaching during interactions will help\n\nOpen banking and ecosystem\n\nThree-quarters of banks say they have a clear strategy for increasing open-ecosystem investment, and 60% are generating commercial gains in open finance, BaaS and embedded finance\n\nThe industry agreed on the need for regulatory involvement in innovation. API standards fragmentation, differences in the data banks provide to common requests and inconsistent UX are not conducive to widespread adoption. It also recognized the need for better value-chain cost and incentive alignment\n\nLending, a key use case for open banking, gives access to new forms of support application and underwriting process insight. It’s part of a more extensive alternative data landscape for consumer-permission data\n\nEmbedded finance needs fresh thinking, particularly partnerships between banks and fintechs (challenging for both sides). Banks must improve partner relationship management — especially compliance and risk — and explore solutions to help scale embedded finance\n\nCards and payments\n\nThe impact of activities will not be the same across the board, and not everything needs urgent attention\n\nPayments remain mission-critical, but banks face many challenges, e.g., compliance programs, rising costs and revenue pressure. Making meaningful rather than incremental improvements will be vital\n\nISO 20022 is the future. Banks need to embrace the change in financial messaging ASAP to get to the benefits for themselves and their clients\n\nThere’s plenty of innovation, from next-gen tech providers enabling new types of card programs to new forms of money that banks must address rapidly\n\nAI has been used in payment use cases for over a decade. Now, GenAI could provide a step change. However, fraud professionals must tread carefully\n\nProduct and capability innovation\n\nWinning/retaining deposits and loans will be even more crucial. Higher-for-longer interest rates, fintech offerings and a yearlong expansion of banking features by digital brokerages mean the continued fracturing of customer relationships\n\nBanks will increasingly offer targeted and differentiated product propositions (often via integration with segment-focused fintechs). Large and small institutions chase a broader market with new, all-digital brands to extend the reach and open deposit-gathering opportunities beyond their physical footprint\n\nThis will drive product development investment and the creation of customer-centric bundles that allow for product, pricing, terms and feature customization to meet customer and regulatory demands. Banks must create enterprise services, spanning individual product systems to support sales and service functions\n\nBesides increasing speed and agility, cloud will determine how and what financial institutions migrate. In addition to intelligent automation, prime technology investment will include a growing interest in low-code tooling for business-critical applications\n\nGenAI will be embedded in DevOps, accelerating modernization, new development and testing\n\nEmerging technology\n\nGenAI is now a consumer service. What started as a global stateless currency has evolved into routine use cases.\n\nGenAI, metaverse, AR/VR and quantum computing are being explored or evaluated by many banks and will have a significant impact on the market in 5 years’ time\n\nGenAI is moving from initial experiments to value delivery. Many vendors are incorporating GenAI into their offerings with cloud (and other) platforms, bringing foundation models and environments to develop and scale solutions. However, GenAI must be handled with care and guidelines\n\nThe private sector is ahead of central banks in developing and launching digital money. With proven value in select use cases, initiatives must scale. Only a few central banks have launched CBDCs (to a lukewarm response). The ECB has just approved the next phase of its Digital Euro project, and European banks must engage to influence development\n\nIn Europe, the momentum is shifting towards digital identity with large-scale pilots testing the European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet. U.S. banks should monitor digital identity while continuing to improve traditional IDV approaches\n\nRetail banking IT spending forecast\n\nIT spending in 2022 continued 2012’s recovery, with global spending rising to 4.3%. A similar increase (4.4%) is expected, reaching $261.3 billion in 2023. This is lower than projected (5.2%) mainly because of weaker growth in Tier 2 and Tier 3 U.S. banks\n\nThe 2024 outlook is even more positive. Celent expects IT spending to reach $274.4 billion, an increase of 5.0% over 2023\n\nSource: Celent – Retail banking IT spending forecast 2023-2028\n\nMedium-term IT spending is set to grow as banks pull focus on digital transformation, driving investment in modernization, security, automation and digital engagement\n\nCelent expects stronger short-term growth, peaking at 5.5% in 2025. In 2024, a 5% increase is expected\n\nGrowth will slow as banks try to extract cost benefits from application rationalization, modernization and cloud migration\n\nIT intensity (IT spending as a proportion of non-interest expenses) has risen steadily over the last decade, with many banks attempting to curtail growth or even reverse IT spending as a proportion of overall operating costs\n\nCore banking systems: Mainframe or cloud?\n\nAccording to IDC’s recent Future of Digital Infrastructure Worldwide Sentiment Survey, 47% of financial institutions intend to keep production workloads on premises over the next 2 years, either on private cloud deployments or on dedicated, traditional platforms.\n\nWhether on mainframe or server farms, traditional technological resources will remain in operation and form part of the organization’s innovation strategy for the foreseeable future. However, this depends on the bank continuing to develop new platform functionality or find ways to modernize elements and create business opportunities.\n\nBanks with older technologies not considered for immediate transformation should plan to maximize their value, forming strategies that include go-forward development.\n\nWhat goes/stays?\n\nMany banking workloads will move to the cloud, but other applications (or parts thereof) will remain on dedicated mainframe resources. Consequently, banks need to plan for innovation in the core regardless of the deployment technology. The primary considerations for determining which bank workloads to migrate to the cloud include security, cloud costs, data sensitivity and compliance.\n\nFinancial services deployment landscape 2025\n\nn = 133 financial institutions worldwide\n\nSource: IDC’s Future of Digital Infrastructure Worldwide Sentiment Survey, June 2023\n\nCloud has become a transformative technology for the banking industry and continues to advance daily. Even so, the on-prem data center is still a critical deployment model for many financial services institutions as part of an overall fit-for-purpose infrastructure strategy.\n\nModern mainframes\n\nToday’s mainframes still provide traditional high availability, highly secure and high-transactional throughput. But now they support microservices-based workloads, IoT, AI/ML workloads, modern development tools and agile development methodologies as well. These capabilities can be leveraged by core systems that are also modernized and remain on the mainframe.\n\nMainframe hybrid cloud strategy\n\nMainframe transformation supported by APIs, microservices and containers has given banks more freedom to decouple the business logic of the traditional, monolithic core and modernize/migrate pieces of the core system to appropriate platforms (including cloud), avoiding the considerable risk of wholesale platform migration. The institution might choose to keep some of the most critical core functionality (e.g., transaction processing, customer data and general ledger) on the mainframe by design.\n\nSupportive partnerships\n\nVirtually every global sector lacks the skilled staff to operate (let alone transform) their infrastructure. Consequently, to ensure that mainframe-based platforms continue to provide secure, resilient and scalable operations, using partners that understand banking business models and have the resources to work on existing systems and innovate will be critical.\n\nFirms need to find partners that understand the banking rules about data sensitivity, regulatory compliance, resilience, performance and scalability. Prospective partners must also be experts in banking products and services to support ongoing development.\n\nIn addition to having the experience (and people) to understand the characteristics of mainframe development and operations, the right partner will have equal expertise in digital infrastructure, including cloud and edge, as these technologies must be perfectly meshed to maintain all the characteristics required by the banking industry.\n\nBanking BPS market size and growth\n\nBanking Business Process Services (BPS) refers to outsourcing specific business processes to third-party providers. Outsourced services aim to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and enable banks to focus on core competencies.\n\nThe banking BPS market — valued at US$ 22.58 billion in 2022 — is projected to reach US$ 39.70 billion by 2030 (a CAGR of 11.11% from 2023-2030).\n\nPrimary factors driving market growth include increased lending and depositing, the increasing acceptance of digitalization, centralization and competition. The global banking BPS market report thoroughly analyzes key segments, trends, drivers, restraints, the competitive landscape and factors that play a substantial role in the market.\n\nMarket overview\n\nCost reduction is a significant driver for banking BPS. Outsourcing non-core processes enables banks to achieve cost savings through economies of scale, reduced operational expenses and optimized resource allocation.\n\nOutsourcing allows banks to concentrate on core functions like strategic planning, customer relationship management and product innovation. They can enhance their competitive advantage by delegating routine and administrative tasks to BPS providers specializing in specific banking processes, efficient workflows and technologies. In this way, banks benefit from streamlined and optimized operations.\n\nBanks can access advanced technologies, software and infrastructure through BPS providers, navigating complex regulatory environments effectively without substantial upfront investment. Providers often specialize in managing regulatory compliance and risk mitigation, too. Banks face the challenges of finding and retaining skilled personnel for specific functions.\n\nBanking BPS market size and growth\n\nRevenue in US$ billion. Source: Everest Group – Banking Operations State of the Market 2023\n\nThe global banking operations outsourced market grew by 10%-11% in 2022, with total spending crossing US$ 8 billion\n\nThe 2021-2022 double-digit growth in BPS outsourcing came after 2020’s pandemic shutdowns. Cross-industry enterprises turned to outsourcing as a cost-cutting BCP lever and a strategic differentiator for providing frictionless, digital CXs. This was also fueled by increased demand for cards, payments and FCC operations\n\nIncreasing adoption of digital banking services, cost-effective solutions and customer-centric services are driving market growth\n\nKey contributors are risk and compliance, mortgage and loan servicing, payment services and retail banking operations\n\nLooking for more?\n\nIf you’d like to discuss further the opportunities that future AI-driven services and emerging technologies have in store, visit our website or contact us.\n\nAfter all, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone else planted a tree a long time ago.”"
