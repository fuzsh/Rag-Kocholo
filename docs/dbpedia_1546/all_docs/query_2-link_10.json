        "text": "The recent bank bailouts and buyouts have created an atmosphere of concern and uncertainty in the banking industry. Additionally, traditional banks face significant challenges amid changing consumer behavior, an economic landscape still recovering from the impact of COVID-19 and competition from born-in-the-cloud challenger banks. In this increasingly demanding environment, bankers have the chance to fight back by investing further in their digitalisation programs.\n\nAI, data analytics and automation technologies offer an opportunity to transform customer experience and automate repeated processes. With these tools, banks can supercharge their operations by delivering relevant data and insights at the right time and speed to the right people, optimising and accelerating decision making. At the heart of this transformation is data. Properly sourcing, managing, interpreting and protecting data will be the key ingredient for banks to grow, manage risk and make strategic investments for years to come.\n\nWith so many opportunities within the sector, here are five data-related trends that are shaping the future of banking.\n\n1. Banks must create digital operating models fit for the modern customer experience.\n\nFor banks to remain relevant to a new generation of tech-savvy consumers they must focus on digital customer journeys and how people are accessing and experiencing their products and services. Banks are moving as quickly as they can to power this customer experience, but as they do so they must continue to adopt technologies with the latest security protocols.\n\nThe agility that new technology brings also enables banks to quickly launch new products and services, extend customer contact, make business processes more efficient and improve connectivity with ecosystem partners. For example, Open Banking protocols allow data to be exchanged (with the customer’s permission) among ecosystem players to drive greater value, benefits and innovative offerings for the customer.\n\nMany traditional banks are making headway, including JP Morgan Chase, which recently announced plans to open a digital bank in Germany by 2025; Lloyds banking group, which outlined a three-year digitisation strategy; and Santander, which is utilising big data to drive customer experience and digital transformation.\n\nDeriving insights about customer experience will continuously enhance what this experience looks and feels like, creating a virtuous circle and, ultimately, increased customer loyalty. To make all this happen, banks must also re-assess their operating models: easier and better data integration, more efficient processes, faster response times and creating “plug & play” platforms make for a more resilient business and enable faster monetisation of the available data.\n\n2. Protecting data from cyberattacks will continue to be a top priority for corporate banks and their customers.\n\nAt the boardroom level, the C-suite will continue to prioritise cybersecurity, knowing that any breach would have a disastrous impact on their reputation and, by extension, their bottom line. The penalties associated with failing to secure the data entrusted to them as they evolve their business models are too great for the banks to take this matter lightly. Therefore, banks will continue to invest heavily to protect against cyberattacks, data breaches and financial crime.\n\nAs banks transform their businesses, they are increasingly partnering with financial technology companies to optimize payments, underwriting and app development. Some banks are even offering banking-as-a-service to fintechs, giving them the opportunity to take advantage of the bank’s charters and deposit insurance while providing more nimble services to consumers.\n\nHowever, it is essential that banks have the right cybersecurity controls in place to protect themselves and their customers’ data when partnering with less-regulated companies. Equally, fintechs looking to partner with banks need to prepare for the complex regulatory, cybersecurity and risk management obligations of banks if they are to establish a successful relationship.\n\n3. Sophisticated, secure identity management will help banks manage their cost base and personalise consumers’ day-to-day transactions.\n\nBanking communities in Europe, the Americas and Asia are moving quickly to roll out new digital platforms. Digital Identity management is key to making them secure and efficient. Indeed, there is a great deal of interest in the work DXC Technology has done in Norway to implement and run the BankID identity scheme for the country. Relying on trusted and verifiable sources, BankID has dramatically increased the speed and reliability of validating identities and processing transactions across all areas of banking in Norway: from payments to account opening and asset transfers. This work has provided deep, data-driven insights into what is possible in digital banking when infrastructures, ecosystems and business processes align, and is helping lay the groundwork for tomorrow’s model.\n\nElsewhere in the market, secure identity management is facilitating moves like Western Union’s (WU) integration of Mambu into its new digital bank platform, which gives WU full control to deploy new banking products and services that are easy to configure and integrate with external applications. In a single native mobile app, customers can now open an account in minutes in what is being seen as a move to transform the transactional relationships WU has with its customers into closer customer-centric connections.\n\n4. Data will be at the heart of proving the effectiveness of sustainability investments.\n\nAll businesses – small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular – are transforming to ensure their operations are sustainable. The scale of the task can seem overwhelming. Banks help remove some of the angst by providing the critical financial vehicles to help SMEs on their sustainability journeys, as well as fund public-private partnerships that further the sustainability agenda.\n\nAs well as being the right thing to do and a key part of the corporate social responsibility banks hold, such investment will be increasingly welcomed by customers who are more discerning of sustainable business practices. Many banks are creating ecosystems that bring together a range of relevant organisations, including specialist ESG-related public and private finance suppliers. These platforms can provide and exchange the data required to monitor progress and create innovation.\n\nDemonstrating the impact of the banks’ contribution to such causes will depend on the ability to monitor, track, report and (therefore) adjust their initiatives for maximum effect. This can only be achieved with data: banks will invest in the proper tools, processes and reporting environments to manage the impact of their ESG-related investments effectively.\n\n5. Banks need to reinvigorate their hiring practices to ensure they are reaching the talent that can take them into the future.\n\nThere are multiple scenarios that impact staffing needs. These include:\n\nIncreasing reliance on digital technologies\n\nTransitioning to platform-driven businesses powered by data\n\nShifting focus from shareholder relations to stakeholder relations\n\nRenewing emphasis on purpose-led strategies\n\nWith such a wide range of issues impacting a bank’s day-to-day operations, proper staffing is as vital as it is nuanced, and requires upskilling existing staff and hiring to plug skills gaps and service growth areas.\n\nOf equal importance are the expectations of the people being recruited. Younger employees work and communicate very differently to those who are used to historic “analog” banking operations. To attract and retain the best talent, banks need to invest in practices and technologies that speak to this audience, and mirror the digital offerings being put to customers. Data gleaned through the recruitment process and employee staff surveys will ensure banks stay on track."
