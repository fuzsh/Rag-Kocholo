        "text": "GoldenSource, the leading independent provider of Enterprise Data Management (EDM) and Master Data Management (MDM) solutions for the securities and investment management industry, bolstered its management team today with the announcement of three new hires to support its growth across capital markets in Europe.\n\nThe recruits include Charlie Browne, who will head up Market Data and Risk Solutions, in addition to Haider Mannan and Graham Langley, who will lead dedicated buy and sell-side sales teams respectively. Charlie’s previous post was as Head of IPV at Lloyds Banking Group. In his new role, he will be tasked with continuing to build-out the firms Market Data Solutions product – which links reference data such as corporate actions and end-of-day pricing, with more time-critical market data, including intraday pricing, rates and curves.\n\n“In the current regulatory climate, efficient integration of risk and market data management is the next major step for financial institutions. Being able to provide integrated solutions that address the control and regulatory demands is crucial for GoldenSouce’s success,” said Charlie in reaction to his appointment.\n\nHaider Mannan joins the team from IDS GmbH. In his role as Senior Sales Director he will develop GoldenSource’s buy-side proposition. Haider’s sell-side counterpart, Graham Langley, has a strong sales track record working for the likes of SunGard Financial Systems, Misys and other banking enterprise providers. Graham’s experience will ensure GoldenSource continues to meet its strategic objectives for sell-side clients.\n\n“It is hugely exciting time to join the company. From a brokerage perspective, I believe that a consultative and strategic approach is key to delivering answers to the questions the industry is posing,” said Graham. “Today, all asset managers are faced with new data management challenges, particularly around reporting and centralisation. It is great to join at a time when GoldenSource has released its latest platform and strategically invested in cloud capabilities, both tailored to the needs of buy-side firms,” added Haider.\n\nCommenting on the significance of the appointments, Neill Vanlint, Managing Director of EMEA and Asia at GoldenSource, said: “This hat-trick of hires is a clear sign of our continued commitment firstly to deepening our capability in the market data space – with FRTB a clear driver – but also to the growing community of European clients. The wealth of experience and industry knowledge of our new recruits will help us ensure that our solutions meet immediate and ongoing needs of both brokers and asset managers.”\n\nAll three execs are based in GoldenSource’s London office."
