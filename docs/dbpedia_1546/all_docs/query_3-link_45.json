        "text": "However, as with most things, it’s easier said than done. There are three key challenges, according to Erfurth, that private equity firms face when adopting new technologies, namely a lack of standardised processes, a certain friction in the technology and ways of working between asset managers and third-party service providers, such as quarterly accounting vs. the wish to access real time data, and a required shift in the mindset of people to adapt to new ways of working. “It always needs to be a combined approach considering the people, the organisation, the processes, and the systems. All of these aspects need to go hand-in-hand to make a true transformation successful” emphasises Erfurth. “To take everyone along on the journey, make sure not to lose talented people and that the organization is mature enough to value the new ways of working and to embrace them into the company culture takes more time than just introducing new tools.”\n\nDigitalisation will impact the operations teams’ day to day as their focus will shift away from data collection as well as low variance processes that can be automated, and towards processes with higher variance and lower standardisation. That’s where the teams’ expert knowledge adds the most value.\n\nAlongside the drive to bring new technology into operations, digitalisation can significantly increase the transparency, security and availability of information to investors. Online communication platforms, such as the EQT Investor Portal, where EQT’s fund investors receive account statements, drawdown notices and other investment related information in a secure and centralised place, are replacing emails entirely. Covid also put an emphasis on the ability to perform fundraising in a digital way.\n\nBesides their investors, private equity firms put a strong focus on the development of their portfolio companies. Helping them to adapt to the right technologies is a key priority. This has been further enhanced by Covid. In this respect, within days of switching to remote working, EQT reached out to the portfolio companies and offered them support with best practices around remote ways of working, virtual training sessions and technology recommendations to help them to maximise online collaboration and productivity of their workforce as well as to increase cybersecurity. “What started as an ad hoc activity following the initial impact of Covid has since grown into a full digital support concept for portfolio companies, including dedicated EQT digital relationship leads with ongoing dialogue with the portfolio companies to discuss digital strategy and value creation opportunities” Erfurth notes. This has since morphed into ensuring these companies develop their expertise for digital capabilities and incorporate new technologies into their day-to-day work.\n\nErfurth espouses that “everything can always be improved… This is one of EQT’s key mission statements. The goal is to make EQT a smarter investor, owner and seller and to future-proof all portfolio companies by making them digital leaders in their industries.” Given the growing industry competition, those private equity firms that are set up to succeed in the coming years are those that are able to harness the value of data management and the new technologies to remain top performers and provide stakeholders with the best digitally-enabled solutions."
