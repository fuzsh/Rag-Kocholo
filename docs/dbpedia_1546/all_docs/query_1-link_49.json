In addition, clients will be able to acquire Avox data held on their entities of interest on a request/response basis and then access and manage this data within GoldenSource’s EDM platform,” according to the statement. “The integration will facilitate client on-boarding and counterparty data management as well as help firms to satisfy regulatory requirements.”\n\nThe new service will “add value to trading, operations, risk and compliance areas of both buy-side and sell-side institutions,” says Neill Vanlint, global managing director of GoldenSource.\n\nAvox is a wholly owned subsidiary of the DTCC.\n\nNeed a Reprint?"
