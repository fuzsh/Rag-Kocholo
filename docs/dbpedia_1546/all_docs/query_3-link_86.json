CUBE’s intelligent tools also allow for fully automated workflows to be created, based on previous actions.\n\nThe architecture of the product and serverless deployment in the cloud is built specifically to manage the volume, variety, and velocity of modern regulatory issuances.\n\nARI delivers actionable insights into changing regulatory trends, suggests other relevant topics that may of interest, and help teams prioritise the right resources to tackle the regulation effectively.\n\nThis proactive approach ensures compliance with evolving regulations and enables businesses to adapt swiftly to regulatory changes, positioning them for success however uncertain the regulatory landscape.\n\nThe birth of RegBrain\n\nThe new era of compliance will be marked with advances such as our intuitive RegBrain solution. It allows banks to apply AI models directly to their own content, ensuring much faster release and feedback cycles.\n\nRegBrain equips compliance teams with the power to access revolutionary features such as structural detection, classification, entity extraction, summarisation, and recommendations.\n\n“As CUBE embarks upon a new era, we have reached the point where we have gone from machine reading of regulations to the early stages of machine understanding and the next phase will be machine enforcing,” said Dr Yin Lu, Head of Product and AI at CUBE.\n\n“Compliance is a competitive advantage, not a cost centre. We have to shift this frame of thinking. And the advantage is provided by AI (with human experts in the loop, of course). Because of RegTech, the role of the compliance manager is fundamentally evolving.”\n\nCUBE’s purpose-built AI engine (RegAI) tracks every single regulation in every regulated country, territory, and state across the globe in every published language.\n\nThe future of compliance and Automated Regulatory Intelligence\n\nThere are two clear trends apparent in compliance today; the volume and velocity of regulation will continue to rise, and proactive compliance is the only way to manage such a level of change.\n\nFor banks, Automated Regulatory Intelligence is the key to meeting these challenges, delivering efficiencies at scale, and revolutionising the capabilities of the compliance function.\n\nTo learn more about Automated Regulatory Intelligence and how CUBE can ease your regulatory burden, contact us today."
