        "text": "Bigger may not always be better, but after a period in which large financial institutions appeared to struggle most with rising data requirements, the most recent Fitch Solutions Credit Risk Survey points to the burden shifting to small and mid-sized institutions.\n\nFitch Solutions research shows it’s now often mid-sized banks experiencing the biggest rises in data use, and that even small banks see quantitative and qualitative data increasing faster than large banks.\n\nFor all this abundance, mid-sized and smaller banks also face more challenges in securing the data they need. For example, mid-sized institutions are most likely to report challenges resulting from counterparties being reluctant to share information, reliance on assumptions, or future uncertainty. Smaller banks meanwhile run into barriers due to a scarcity of reliable historical data far more frequently than larger peers.\n\nNot surprisingly, many small and mid-sized banks are scrambling to marshal resources in response. “A decade ago we saw chief data officers (CDOs) start popping up in tier one institutions, but over the last couple of years it’s clear the trend has spread to the mid-market,” says Ben Abbate, Global Head of Sales, Data and Analytics, Fitch Solutions. “There’s a real push to have data lakes, access to data, quantitative analytics and similar tools in place.”\n\nBut according to Abbate many of these efforts may be misdirected – even ultimately unnecessary. A lot of the fixation on data capabilities, he says, “is driven by hype rather than anything more tangible.”\n\n“The vendor community is certainly talking it up, and there’s also a degree of customer-driven market pressure to have answers to questions like how scientific your data analysis is, who manages your data lake, and what your alternative deep data sources are,” he explains. “Yet outside that reflexivity, there’s often not a genuine business need for these things.”\n\nThe fact is, at least when it comes credit risk, regulatory trends are poised to ease the data burden on banks of all sizes.\n\n“Regulations are actually making credit risk management easier, and much less data intensive,” Abbate says. “Basel IV is going to make calculations simpler, and put a floor on the reliance on proprietary data modeling, so from a risk perspective, it's going to be much easier to calculate. Yet what we see in the market is this thirst for doing more things with numbers, when the numbers are only good for so much. You actually need to make these things work for the business.”\n\nLearning to let go\n\nRather than racing to onboard specialists or adopting the latest data platforms, Abbate advocates a more measured, tactical approach to data in credit risk management, particularly for smaller institutions that may lack the resources to support star hires or transformational technology projects.\n\nStep one is to change the mentality around the risk management role, to make the most of existing resources and capabilities instead of bolting on new ones that can rapidly outgrow the organisation’s practical needs.\n\n“Credit risk managers need to understand that the job is evolving; that they have to be more data savvy and scientific in their approach, to manage more complicated layers of governance,” he says. “When you use a data set to make predictions, it will have to be validated. Your models will have to be peer reviewed. As a risk manager you have to be part of the changes in your space.”\n\nThis doesn’t mean risk managers will be forced to turn into quasi-data scientists. Abbate notes it’s much more about learning to work with the tools that are available, and crucially, having the right data foundation to start with.\n\n\"If you as a credit risk professional are adapting your processes to become more data centric, and preparing for more governance and scrutiny around your data sets and your models, the underlying data you’re using becomes incredibly important,\" he says.\n\nInstead of pouring investment into the integration of multiple data sources or sophisticated analytics platforms, Abbate urges institutions to concentrate on finding a “golden source” – a comprehensive, high-quality data set that can serve as a reliable basis for compliance, and informed decision-making.\n\nSets should be evaluated in terms of their data quality, depth and diversity. To provide a robust historical lens on crises, credit professionals will need data assembled over decades, and fully covering regions.\n\n“Emerging markets are really where the predictive analysis is most needed,” says Abbate. “No one really needs to analyse how tier-two US banks are going to perform; they’re looking at emerging markets like Asia. Managers need to be able to understand the markets where there's not a consensus view.”\n\nThe ideal starting point\n\nA high-quality data set that has already been subjected to multiple layers of analysis can effectively give institutions a head start in their efforts to pursue predictive analysis, saving the time and resources needed to clean data, or to build models from scratch.\n\nThe Fitch Solutions data set, for example, has been assembled over decades, perfectly harmonizing data in publicly available statements from multiple continents and institution types to provide the kind of historical lens on crises that less robust or far-reaching sources may lack. It also benefits from Fitch’s ratings intelligence, a long-established financial industry benchmark, and geographic reach with especially strong coverage of emerging markets.\n\n“The mid-market is the perfect application for this kind of data set because it’s analytically ready,” says Abbate. “You can use it as a foundation to make almost any type of predictive analysis, whether a macro trend, micro trend, institutional trend or peer groups.”\n\nWhile Basel IV may level the playing field somewhat, the slow pace of implementation and a generally higher-risk environment mean the data pressures on small and mid-sized banks are unlikely to diminish. But Abbate says regardless of how requirements or conditions change, institutions won’t go wrong if they go “back to the basics” – which in this context means finding sources of data capable of supporting the goals of credit risk teams, rather than doubling down on new hires, expensive technology or complex infrastructure.\n\n“We have an extraordinary data set that that really fits the moment,” he says. “Instead of trying to tackle a project that’s not really related to your core business, or having some generalist data scientists tell you what you need, you can simply plug into this assembled expertise, all this standardized and analyst-ready data, and the accuracy and consistency of having done it since the 1980s. A clean, golden source is what every institution ultimately needs for predictive analysis, and it’s not an innovation we’ll see in the distant future – it's available right now.”"
