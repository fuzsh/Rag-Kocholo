        "text": "In brief\n\nDigital transformation is essential for traditional banks to remain competitive against fintech companies and neobanks\n\nKey drivers include high customer expectations, competition for wallet share, operational efficiency objectives, and risks caused by outdated infrastructure\n\nTechnologies such as cloud computing, robotic process automation, advanced data analytics and chatbots are transforming the financial services industry\n\nIs it the end of the line for traditional banking?\n\nWhy is digital transformation a necessity for incumbent financial institutions today? One word — competition.\n\nNot only is there competition from other banks with a digital transformation strategy in place (three-quarters of them already have one), but fintech startups and neobanks are also putting pressure on traditional banks, competing for their wallet share.\n\nThe pandemic only accelerated the digital-first approach to financial services. In the United States, 42% of surveyed consumers reported having at least one fintech account at the end of 2020. The pandemic prompted a 6% increase in the share of fintech users within as little as six months.\n\nThe allure of fintech for consumers is simple — convenience. From AI-powered personalization to digital account opening, fintech products make their lives easier. And if banks don’t keep up with the technology-powered services, they’ll lose their competitive edge and wallet share.\n\nWhat is digital transformation in banking?\n\nDigital transformation (DT) is the strategic embedding of new technologies in the organization’s operations to:\n\nOptimize and streamline existing processes\n\nDeliver a more satisfying and valuable customer experience\n\nLaunch and develop a new, innovation-driven activity or product\n\nConquer a new market or niche\n\nAs Harvard Business Review puts it, digital transformation relies on five essential components:\n\nExamples of digital transformation in banking include:\n\nIn this industry, digital transformation comes with its challenges — regulatory compliance and cybersecurity. So, keep know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) best practices and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) in mind.\n\nSix drivers of digital transformation in banking\n\nToday, consumers expect banks to meet them where they are — online and on their preferred devices. For example, only 17% of U.S. bank customers would opt to go to a branch to make a transfer. Instead, they prefer using online (46%) or mobile (30%) banking to complete their transactions. And PwC found that in 2021, 61% of U.S. consumers used digital banking channels weekly.\n\nCompetition for wallet share\n\n47% of bank and credit union executives consider fintech companies a significant threat. Neobanks, however, have become less intimidating. Only 21% of executives reported seeing them as a threat in 2023, as opposed to 33% in 2022.\n\nBut fintech companies and neobanks aren’t the only one’s that banks will have to compete with in the digital banking domain. Over three-quarters of banks already have a digital transformation strategy and more than 18% plan to launch theirs in 2023.\n\nOperational resilience required\n\nMuch like digital transformation itself, operational resilience is no longer an option. Instead, banks have to operate in a hectic market environment, rocked by one event after another. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing US banking crisis are just a few examples.\n\nSix technologies transforming the financial services of today\n\nNow, let’s review the six technologies that power digital innovation in banking.\n\nApplication programming interfaces (APIs)\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA)\n\nThis technology increases productivity and reduces labor costs while improving employee job satisfaction and mitigating human error. The beauty of RPA is that it doesn’t require overhauling existing systems; RPA tools are akin to an add-on a bank can easily integrate.\n\nWhen it comes to the nitty-gritty applications of advanced data analytics during digital transformation in banking, they include:\n\nWhat may stand in the way of digital transformation in banking?\n\nHere’s what prevents banks from reaching their objectives and nailing the DT strategy implementation.\n\nResistance to change\n\nDigital transformation of banks often requires a shift in the organization’s culture. Without it, banks risk resistance to change, undermining its DT results.\n\nTo achieve this cultural shift, it’s crucial to bring every stakeholder on board to pinpoint knowledge-sharing and training needs. This includes branches in different jurisdictions; front, middle, and back offices; C-level executives to frontline employees.\n\nLack of skills or resources\n\nExecutives should approach DT planning with expertise and caution to avoid this mistake. The two will help adequately assess the current state of things and the scale of change digital transformation will entail.\n\nChange complexity\n\nExecutives also tend to pay more attention to the complexity of change required for a meaningful, impactful digital transformation in banking. And that mistake translates into underestimating the resources needed for DT.\n\nThe transition requires executives to reflect on data management, interdependencies across multiple tools and ecosystems, existing and desired IT infrastructure, and more.\n\nTo accurately assess and prepare for change complexity, it’s crucial to involve all stakeholders in strategy development. Executives should also clearly understand the current and desired state of the bank’s digital ecosystem.\n\nDependency on legacy systems\n\nHow banks approach digital transformation: Three case studies\n\nWhat does digital transformation in banking look like in practice? Let’s break down three examples of how banks successfully made the transition.\n\nThe reason? Extensive customization features, high personalization, and tight security with location-based features. It’s also backed by machine learning that allows sending three billion personalized messages a year.\n\nHow banks can benefit from digital transformation\n\nWith the right strategy, talent, partnerships, and resource allocation, here are the five benefits banks can reap from digital transformation in banking.\n\nImproved customer acquisition\n\nDigital transformation may involve introducing the tech-driven services that fintech companies and neobanks are usually known for. Doing so will make the bank’s brand more alluring to potential customers who’d otherwise turn to its tech-savvy competitors.\n\nPersonalizing the customer experience\n\nDetailed insight into consumers\n\nAll that data serves not only to power personalized multichannel customer experiences, but also to inform the bank with strategic decisions, marketing or otherwise.\n\nOn an individual level, these insights will help accurately assess risks associated with each customer, streamlining — and possibly automating — lending decisions.\n\nEnhanced flexibility and adaptability\n\nWith a leaner infrastructure that runs like a well-oiled machine, banks can reduce time to market for updates, new features, and products. This will allow for quickly matching new customer preferences, adapt to emerging and existing competitors’ offerings, innovate and respond to market trends.\n\nComprehensive data security\n\nFor more Banking and Capital Markets insights, see Luxoft on LinkedIn\n\nFollow Us"
