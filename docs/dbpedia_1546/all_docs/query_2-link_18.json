        "text": "Key Take-aways: In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been working on rules regarding the disclosure of corporate carbon emissions. However, California is now taking the initiative to address climate change concerns independently. The proposed legislation, which has already been passed by lawmakers in Sacramento, has two main components. First, it mandates that larger companies report comprehensive data on their emissions, offering a more detailed picture of their environmental impact. Second, it requires these companies to assess the financial risks associated with climate change, potentially introducing new complexities in financial reporting. Impact on Reporting: The legislation's requirement for expansive emission reporting and financial risk assessment could pose significant challenges for banks and other large corporations in California. For instance, banks might need to disclose detailed information about their carbon emissions stemming from their operations, including data on energy consumption, transportation, and office facilities. Furthermore, they may have to assess the financial risks posed by climate-related events, such as wildfires, droughts, or extreme weather events, which could impact their assets and investments. This could result in banks needing to reevaluate their risk management strategies and potentially allocate additional resources to climate-related risk mitigation. In essence, this legislation may prompt a fundamental shift in how banks report on their environmental impact and financial exposure to climate change. #regulations #climatechange #emergingrisks #banking #SEC\n\n490 pages to 886 pages That is the transition from the SEC's proposed Climate risk disclosure rule titled \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors \" from March 2022 to March 2024. However, the final rule is significantly watered down, especially by excluding Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions, or financed emissions, would have caused significant issues for financial institutions. The proposed March 22 regulation would have required public companies to report their climate emissions in three standardized reporting forms: 1. Scope 1 emissions are those generated onsite. For a bank, it could be the boiler in the basement burning natural gas to provide heat for the building. 2. Scope 2 emissions are from purchased energy, such as electricity from the local utility. 3. Scope 3 emissions are generated by a company’s supply chain and products in service. For a bank, it could be carbon emissions that result from the bank’s loans and investments, which are the bank's products. These range from real estate to fossil fuels and other carbon-intensive products. Some companies already disclose Scopes 1 and 2. These are the easiest to report using energy supply and utility bills. Scope 3 is complex. It requires an analysis of all greenhouse gas impacts from a company’s supply inputs and the carbon implications for its products used over their lifetime. This change will certainly reduce the reporting burden, but it will also dash the hopes of climate activists, as Scope 3 emission disclosure from banks would have given greater transparency on the global climate emissions generated by bank investments and made an asset's carbon profile relevant to banks' credit risk policies.

Banking groups are concerned that the state regime won't align with federal rules. Earlier this month, lawmakers in Sacramento passed two bills that would require larger companies that operate in California to report expansive measurements of their emissions, as well as to account for the financial risks of climate change. For months, banks and other U.S. companies have been waiting for new rules from the SEC on the disclosure of corporate carbon emissions. But now the state of California appears poised to act first, which could complicate the reporting requirements for many banks — assuming the Golden State's legislation survives likely legal challenges.\n\nAfter a summer of wildfires and storms, there is timely news out of #California. The state legislature has just approved the #Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act. This legislation is significant as it will mandate that both public and private companies in the state with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion to disclose their #emissions data. The act follows Federal Reserve's recent research, which revealed that only eight out of the world's 30 largest #banks are currently tracking their #scope3 emissions, and even those that do are doing so only partially. Scope 3 emissions are a significant contributor to overall emissions for banks, and the research paper highlighted the lack of clear standards as a potential obstacle to comprehensive reporting. https://lnkd.in/gWhUMjmG #risk #stresstesting #carbonemissions #carbon Canadian Lenders Association\n\nTreasury has recently released the draft bill for Climate-related financial disclosure, making mandatory climate reports required from 1st July for large companies across all industries that meet any of the two criteria: $500 mil Revenue, 500 employees or $1 billion Assets. This includes climate change risks and opportunities, scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. At AIgorithm, we have been fortunate to be working in this specific field for years with ready made solutions having been in discussions with the regulators on specific solutions to provide compliance on a silver plate by the short deadline. #ClimateChange #FinancialDisclosure #Compliance\n\nwhat is the controversy surrounding osfi's involvement in climate policy The controversy surrounding OSFI's involvement in climate policy stems from its implementation of guidelines that require financial institutions to disclose and manage climate-related risks. This has been criticized as regulatory overreach, with concerns raised about the plausibility of the required climate risk disclosure and the potential negative implications for the efficiency of the financial system. The guidelines, such as the Climate Risk Management Guideline B-15, have been a point of contention, as they impose additional requirements on over 350 financial institutions, including chartered banks, and may lead to increased capital requirements to reflect perceived elevated climate risks. While OSFI aims to help institutions understand and mitigate potential impacts of climate-related risks, the controversy lies in the perceived departure from its core mandate of regulating the financial industry to ensure its stability and effectiveness."
