        "text": "Enjoy all the benefits of cloud data services, without having to relearn data management\n\nCloud data platforms, like the one offered by Snowflake, are the latest paradigm in data storage philosophy and promise a number of benefits to aid analytics, processing and reporting. However, when it comes to structured financial data types, there are a number of limitations that impede the potential.\n\nA challenge when taking data into a cloud data platform is that the source data schemas or formats either need to be replicated within the platform or mapped to a schema within the platform. Deciding which approach is most appropriate and putting it into practice is challenging for many IT and data teams. GoldenSource solves for this with our financial services cloud data model and cloud data services to create your data fabric, weave cloud technology and data together, and tailor it to your needs.\n\nWe complement your capabilities – data pipelines and beyond\n\nGoldenSource is synonymous with the industry standard financial data model to mobilize data from all data vendors, data marketplaces and internal sources. So, don’t start from scratch to create a new business information model or data schemas when you license a cloud data warehouse. Let us take care of feeds, formats, symbologies, methodologies and governance, while you get the most from your data (including the full range of ESG data types). Our serviced data pipelines enable rapid ingestion at scale for:\n\nMastering\n\nEnrichment and Data Quality\n\nCross Referencing\n\nValidation\n\nConversion\n\nUnstructured and Structured\n\nHybrids of any of the above\n\nOur cloud data services deliver your capability to get data ‘easy in’ and ‘easy out’ in a consistent way. We provide instant access and analytics, plus on-the-fly calculations for all data used across your business, delivered by our business-as-usual (BAU) services for operational efficiency, resilience and governance.\n\nYou've licensed a cloud data warehouse. Now get the most from it with GoldenSource Cloud Data Services.\n\nLet us take care of getting the data in and making it available for all your business needs. That’s our expertise.\n\nWe provide an open framework that serves all data warehouses and lakes, regardless of cloud provider. Our services ensure you can bring in vendor data, shared data from a cloud marketplace or the data cloud of an investment platform, and your own data. We also provide all the tools to plug in more functionality and data feeds, while we run the service in the background, ensuring the right data is always accessible to the right teams and systems.\n\nFor example, we ensure that you can effortlessly utilize data in four different states of refinement:\n\nRaw Data – e.g. for analysts who want a vendor data feed as is for immediate analysis – onboarded rapidly, validated for essential quality, with no operational overheads\n\nStructured Data – e.g. for client managers who want reporting data readily available in a flat data mart\n\nRefined Data – e.g. for portfolio managers who want highly normalized, mastered data, perhaps matched with internal identifiers\n\nAggregated Data – e.g. for heads of business lines or CFOs who want rolled-up data for performance reporting\n\nCloud Data Services"
