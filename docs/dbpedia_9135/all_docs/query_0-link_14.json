Traditionally it was thought that there were four full cycles, but today it is believed there were only two;\n\n(b) Full style 30 Jan 1962 - 8 Jul 1966: Mwami y'Uburundi = Mwami / Roi du Burundi (also styled in French: Mwami du Burundi)(\"King of Burundi\"). Mwami du Burundi and Roi du Burundi were used in French versions of the legislation interchangeably;\n\n(c) 1 Sep 1966 - 28 Nov 1966: Umwami y'Uburundi = Roi du Burundi (\"King of Burundi\").Umwami w'Abarundi (Kirundi) and Roi des Barundi (French) were also occasionally used in legislation.\n\n²On 6 Jun 1903 the German authorities imposed on Mwezi Gisabo the independence of the two chiefs Macoonco and Cyilima. On 8 Oct 1905 the Germans recognized Mwezi Gisabo as \"Sultan\" of Burundi and its only supreme authority.\n\n³President Nkurunziza died 8 Jun 2020. President of the National Assembly, Pascal Nyabenda (b. 1966)(Hutu) CNDD-FDD, was a constitutional successor in accordance with Art. 121 of the Constitution of 2018. However, Nyabenda never assumed the functions of President. On 12 Jun 2020, the Constitutional Court passed a resolution declaring that an interim presidency was not necessary and called on the authorities for inauguration of the president elect Évariste Ndayishimiye (s.a.) which followed on 18 Jun 2020. The Council of Ministers chaired by First Vice President Gaston Sindimwo (b. 1965)(Tutsi) UPRONA, and Second Vice President Joseph Butore (b. 1969)(Hutu) CNDD-FDD, administered the government until the swearing-in of President elect Évariste Ndayishimiye.\n\nNote: Ethnic groups, which play a preeminent role in politics, are listed in parentheses following names i.e. (Hutu) or (Tutsi). All the kings (mwami) were ethnic Tutsi.\n\nTerritorial Disputes: Burundi and Rwanda dispute two sq km (0.8 sq mi) of Sabanerwa, a farmed area in the Rukurazi Valley where the Akanyaru/Kanyaru River shifted its course southward after heavy rains in 1965; cross-border conflicts persist among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces in the Great Lakes region.\n\nParty abbreviations: CNDD-FDD = Conseil National pour la Défense de la Démocratie-Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy, multi-ethnic Hutu dominated, legalized 2005, est.1994); FRODEBU = Front Démocratique Burundi (Burundi Democratic Front, Hutu moderate, legalized 1992, est.1986); UPRONA = Parti de l'Union et du Progrès National (Party of National Union and Progress, authoritarian, multi-ethnic Tutsi dominated, only legal party 1966-76, 1980-91, dissolved Nov 1976-1980, est.1957); Mil = Military;\n\n- Former parties: UPP = Union des Partis Populaires (Union of People's Parties)\n\nMartyazo\n\n1 May 1972 Hutu rebels proclaim secessionist state Republic of Martyazo\n\n(République de Martyazo) inside the mountainous Vuzigo commune,\n\nbetween the Makamba and Lake Nyanza.\n\n9 May 1972 Rebellion ended by Tusti dominated national government.\n\nPresident\n\n1 May 1972 - 9 May 1972 Antoine Serukwavu?
