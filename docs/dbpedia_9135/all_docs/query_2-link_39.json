        "text": "Tiny Rwanda—the country is approximately the size of the U.S. state of Maryland—sits south of the Equator in central Africa. The landlocked country is bordered by Burundi to the south, Tanzania to the east, Uganda to the north, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.\n\nKnown as the “land of a thousand hills,” Rwanda’s landscape is mostly hilly and mountainous. The Virunga Mountains, located in the northwest part of Rwanda, contain the country’s highest peak, Karisimbi, which reaches nearly 15,000 feet.\n\nTwo major African rivers, the Nile and the Congo, flow through Rwanda. Lake Kivu is the country’s largest lake (and Africa’s sixth largest) and separates Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west. At its deepest point, Lake Kivu plunges 722 feet (220 meters) below the surface. Many people live on the shores of Lake Kivu and fish its waters.\n\nDespite being one of Africa’s smallest countries, Rwanda is one of the continent’s most densely populated with approximately a thousand people per square mile. The Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups make up most of the country’s population. Hutus make up about 85 percent of the population, with most of the remaining population being Tutsis. The majority of both groups practice Christianity.\n\nThe capital of Kigali is the largest city in the country, but most Rwandans live in rural areas. Music and dance are a big part of Rwandan culture in cities and rural areas. Rwanda’s most famous dance is made up of three parts: the intore, meaning dance of heroes, performed by men; the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women; and drumming, performed on drums known as ingoma.\n\nCommon ingredients in Rwandan dishes include bananas, plantains, sweet potatoes, and beans. Fish dishes, especially ones with tilapia, are popular with Rwandans living near lakes. Most Rwandans eat meat only a few times a month.\n\nHome to tropical rainforests, mountain ranges, and volcanoes, Rwanda is one of the most ecologically diverse places in Africa. The continent’s Albertine Rift region, which covers much of western Rwanda, is home to about a third of Africa’s birds, 40 percent of its mammals, and 20 percent of the continent's amphibians and plants.\n\nTravelers come to Rwanda to spot one of the 12 species of primates that inhabit the country’s national parks. Chimpanzees and several types of monkeys live in Nyungwe and Gishwati Mukura National Parks. Volcanoes National Park is home to about one third of the world’s mountain gorilla population as well as five of the eight volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains, a mountain range that stretches across East Africa. The country’s remaining national park, Akagera National Park, is home to black rhinos, hippos, elephants, giraffes, and Rwanda’s national bird: the gold-crested crane.\n\nIn 2003, Rwanda adopted a constitution mapping out a presidential system of government. Rwanda’s president serves as the head of state overseeing two governing bodies: the cabinet, which works alongside the president to create policies, and the parliament, which makes legislation and oversees the activities of the president and the cabinet.\n\nThe country is currently organized into four provinces, plus Kigali, the capital city. A different governor heads each of these five regions. The president is elected every seven years by winning the popular vote from Rwanda’s citizens; he or she appoints the five province governors. The president has a broad set of powers, including commanding the country’s armed forces, negotiating treaties, and declaring war or states of emergency.\n\nRwanda’s economy is mostly agricultural. Bananas, coffee, tea, and tobacco are all major cash crops. One of the fastest growing sectors in the country is tourism, driven mainly by visitors coming to see mountain gorillas in their natural habitat.\n\nConflict between the Hutu and Tutsi people defines much of Rwanda’s history. The Hutus first arrived in Rwanda sometime between the 5th and 11th centuries. The Tutsis arrived a few centuries later, around the year 1300. Despite being the minority group, the Tutsis conquered the Hutus and ruled over Rwanda up until the late 19th century.\n\nIn the 1890s, Germany claimed Rwanda as a colony. Then Belgium occupied the territory in 1916, during World War I. After the war ended in 1918, Belgium renamed Rwanda and its neighboring country of Burundi as the territory of Ruanda-Urundi.\n\nRelations between the Tutsis and the Hutus during the early 20th century were strained. A civil war erupted between the two ethnic groups in 1959, leading to thousands of Tutsis fleeing the country. Rwanda declared itself an independent country in 1962 under new Hutu leaders.\n\nThe Hutus remained in power until 1990. Then, Tutsi rebels invaded the country, starting another civil war. The two groups fought until 1993, when peace negotiations began to take place. But then in 1994, a rocket deployed by the Tutsis shot down the Rwandan president’s plane. The president was a Hutu. Over the next hundred days, the Hutus retaliated by murdering 800,000 people, many of them being Tutsis. Millions of Rwandans fled to escape the genocide, or mass killings.\n\nIn the years following the genocide, many of the refugees did eventually return to their home country. To identify and punish the people who took part in the killings, the United Nations set up a court to hold trials, which lasted until 2015.\n\nRwanda adopted a new constitution in 2003 that aimed to prevent one ethnic group from ever holding too much power in the country. After struggling for decades to recover from the 1994 genocide, the country’s economy has improved, and Rwanda is starting to become known as a technology hub in Africa. But the genocide is still impacting life in Rwanda today; for instance, the government has discouraged citizens from publicly identifying as either Hutu or Tutsi."
