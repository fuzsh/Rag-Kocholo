        "text": "Burundi was part of German East Africa beginning from July 1, 1890 until it was occupied by Belgium in June 1916. It became part of Ruanda-Urundi, which Belgium ruled as a trust territory under the League of Nations on July 20, 1922 and under the United Nations on December 13, 1946. Burundi gained autonomy in January 1961, became an independent kingomd on July 1, 1962, and became a republic in 1966.\n\nThe German Administration in German East Africa Rupie (DOAR) issued banknotes in what is now Burundi until 1916. The Rupie was divisible into 64 Pesa until 1906, and divisible into 100 Heller from 1906 until 1917. After the war began, Von Lettow-Vorbeck, military commander of the German colony, continued to issue banknotes using a child's rubber printing toy set. Since Belgium was under German occupation, the Congo Franc was linked to the British Pound Sterling until June 1919.\n\nFranc banknotes (CBEF), were used in Burundi, originally issued by the Banque du Congo Belge, as a result of the agreement of October 10, 1927. The Banque du Congo was nationalized on July 30, 1951, lost its right to issue banknotes and became the Banque Centrale du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi which became a central bank with the sole right to issue banknotes in the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi beginning on July 1, 1952. The Banque Centrale du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi also issued coins for Ruanda-Urundi in 1952.\n\nWhen Congo left the currency union, the Banque d'Emission du Rwanta et du Burundi was established to issue Francs (BRIF) for Ruanda-Urundi on August 31, 1960 at par to the Belgium Franc. Burundi began issuing the Burundi Franc (BIF) beginning on May 19, 1964. Banknotes were issued by the Banque du Royaume du Burundi from 1964 until 1966, and by the Banque de la Republique du Burundi since 1966."
