        "text": "Before Rwanda gained independence from Belgium in 1962, the country used the Belgian Congo franc and later the Ruanda-Urundi franc. In 1964, Rwanda introduced its own currency, the Rwandan franc (RWF), which replaced the Ruanda-Urundi franc at par.\n\nThe first coins issued in Rwanda were in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 francs. These coins were made of aluminum. Over the years, Rwanda has issued several series of coins with changes in design, metal composition, and denominations to reflect economic conditions and national symbols.\n\nThe following coins in circulation in Rwanda are 1 franc, 5 francs, 10 francs, 20 francs, 50 francs and 100 francs. The 1 franc coin is made from aluminum, while the 5 and 10 franc coins are made of bronze. The 20 and 50 franc coins are made of nickel-plated steel, and the 100 franc coin has a nickel-plated steel ring with a copper-plated steel center.\n\nRwanda's coinage reflects its history and culture, adapting over time to the country's economic and symbolic needs. Rwanda occasionally issues commemorative coins to mark significant national events or anniversaries. These coins are often of higher value and may be made from precious metals."
