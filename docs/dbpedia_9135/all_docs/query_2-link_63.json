Much of this mobility was initiated by migrants themselves rather than by colonial authorities. Building on analytical concepts from economic history and migration theory, this study explains the changing composition and magnitude of one such uncontrolled migration flow, from Ruanda-Urundi to Buganda. Migrants’ mobility choices – when to migrate, for how long, and with whom – proved highly responsive to shifting economic opportunity structures on the sending and receiving ends. Initially, large differences in terms of land and labour endowments, socio-economic structures, and colonial interventions, combined with substantial scope for price arbitrage, created large spatial inequalities of opportunity and strong incentives for circular male labour migration. Over time, however, migration contracted as opportunities in Ruanda-Urundi and Uganda converged, not in the least as a result of large-scale mobility itself.\n\nKeywords\n\nlabour migrationcolonial policyeconomic historyUgandaRwanda\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of African History , Volume 60 , Issue 3 , November 2019 , pp. 379 - 406\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021853719001038 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2019\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Import prices for cloth from British India in Uganda and Ruanda-Urundi closely followed the official exchange rate. While no consumer price series are available for comparison, if anything we may expect prices to have been slightly higher in Ruanda-Urundi than in Uganda, considering that most textiles were imported via the East African harbours, and had to be transported over railway and road via Tanganyika Territory. The market for currency itself appears to have been quite functional, although currency traders probably made substantial profits. Dorsey cites evidence ‘that currency speculation was so profitable to some Africans that [in the late 1920s] the Union Minière had difficulty recruiting workers in eastern Ruanda.’ Dorsey, ‘Rwandan colonial economy’, 92–3. By 1943, South Asians controlled at least some of the currency exchange at the border, charging a commission of 10 to 15 percent.
