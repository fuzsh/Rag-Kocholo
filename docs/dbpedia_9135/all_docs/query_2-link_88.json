        "text": "The National Flag of Rwanda was officially adopted on October 25, 2001. The flag has been designed by a local artist - Alphonse Kirimobenecyo. It represents heroism, confidence, national unity, and respect for work.\n\nThe National Flag of Rwanda is a tricolor featuring three horizontal bands of sky blue (top, double-width), yellow, and green. A golden sun with 24 rays is placed near the fly end of the blue band. The blue color symbolizes peace and happiness. The yellow color of the flag represents economic development and mineral wealth. The green color epitomizes the hope for the country's prosperity and natural resources. The golden yellow sun is a symbol of unity as well as enlightenment and transparency from ignorance. The flag has a width-to-length ratio of 1:2.\n\nHistory of the Flag of Rwanda\n\nIn 1891, Rwanda became a German colony and adopted the flag of German East Africa. This flag featured a white background with a black cross and the top red portion of the flag is colored red with five white-pointed stars. During the First World War in 1916, Belgium invaded and colonized Rwanda and the area was renamed as Rwanda-Burundi under Belgian rule. The flag that was used during this time was a vertical tricolor of black-yellow-red. In 1961, Belgium abolished the monarchy in Rwanda, and the country separated from Burundi and emerged as an independent nation on July 1, 1962. Rwanda, during this time, adopted a red-yellow-green vertical tricolor flag with a large black “R” placed in the central yellow band. This flag was discarded since it became associated with the brutal 1994 genocide. The new flag designed by Alphonse Kirimobenecyo was adopted on October 25, 2001.\n\nThe National Coat of Arms of Rwanda\n\nThe current National Coat of Arms/Seal of Rwanda was adopted in 2001. It contains tribal devices, a sorghum stem, a coffee tree branch along a traditional basket all of which are placed in the central part of the shield. Below these are a cogwheel. A Sun is placed above and two Rwandan shields that are protecting the elements are placed on either side of the central elements. A yellow banner displaying the country name (Repubulika Y’U Rwanda) is placed above the sun. The coat of arms is encircled by a square knot and is attached with a yellow banner displaying the national motto: \"Ubumwe, Umurimo, Gukunda Igihugu\" (\"Unity, Work, Patriotism\")\n\nNational Motto\n\n\"Ubumwe, Umurimo, Gukunda Igihugu\" (\"Unity, Work, Patriotism\")\n\nThe current official currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc (RWF). The Rwandan franc was introduced in 1960 with the first issue in 1964. Each franc has 100 subunits called centimes. The Banque Nationale du Rwanda is the central bank of Rwanda responsible for issuing the Rwandan franc. The Rwandan franc is not pegged to any currency, and therefore, its value tends to change with shifting economic trends.\n\nThe Rwandan franc is issued in various denominations and forms.\n\nCoins\n\nCoins come in small denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 francs with the 100 franc coin being the highest valued coin. Coins are made from various metals including bronze, aluminum, nickel, steel, and copper. Some of the coins have mixed metals such as the 100-franc coin, which is made of steel plated with copper at the center and nickel on the outer ring.\n\nBanknotes\n\nBanknotes are issued as 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 francs and have different designs and colors. The 20-, 50- and 100-franc notes were replaced by coins in 1977 and 2007 for the 100 francs note. Recent issues of the high-value notes have no French descriptions and have their security features reinforced."
