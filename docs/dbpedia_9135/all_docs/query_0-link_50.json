        "text": "LOCATION & GEOGRAPHY: Burundi is a landlocked country in the center of Africa. It is bound by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, Lake Tanganyika to the southwest and Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire) to the west. Burundi is a high rolling country that is part of the Great African Plateau while it forms the divide between the Nile and the Zaire River Basins and has three natural regions. (1.) The Rift Valley also known as the Imbo which is a narrow plain along the western border with Zaire. (2.) The eastern zone known as Kumoso which consists of the central and eastern plateaux and the savannas of the eastern border. (3.) The central mountain region which is a series of ridges that lie north to south. The Ruzizi is the most important river which flows into the Zaire River Basin and all other rivers and tributaries are connected to the Zaire and Nile River Basins. Major Cities (pop. est.); Bujumbura 236,000, Gitega 21,000, Ngozi 15,000 (1990). Land Use; forested 3%, pastures 36%, agricultural-cultivated 53%, other 8% (1993).\n\nMODERN HISTORY - WWII TO 1993: After World War II the former German colony of Ruanda-Urundi was made a trust territory under Belgian administration by the UN. In 1959 it was split into Rwanda and Urundi. In Sept. 1961 Prince Louis Rwagasore became Prime Minister but was assassinated two months later. In the same year Urundi voted to become the independent Kingdom of Burundi and on July 1, 1962 it gained independence with the Tutsi controlling the country. After Burundi's independence, ill feeling between the Hutu and Tutsi led to almost continued unrest. Between 1962 and 1965 two more Prime Ministers were assassinated and in 1966 a military coup led by Michel Micombero overthrew the monarchy and Burundi became a republic. In 1972 an unsuccessful revolt by the Hutu against the Tutsi resulted in 100,000 deaths, most of which were Hutu as well as the death of King Mwami Ntare V. In 1976 Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza ousted Micombero and became President. In 1981 voters approved a new constitution which provided for a National Assembly and in 1982 an assembly was elected. Under Pres. Bagaza relations between Burundi's government and its influential Roman Catholic church deteriorated. Discontentment within the army led to the overthrow of Bagaza in 1987 and Pierre Buyoya succeeded Bagaza. He began working for greater religious freedom, although ethnic fighting flared up resulting in an estimated 5,000 further deaths during 1988. In Feb. 1991 Pres. Buyoya signed a decree which established the Charter of National Unity as a result of a national referendum and on Feb 12, 1991 reshuffled the Council of Ministers in an attempt to mend the ethnic differences resulting in the appointment of 12 Hutu members to the Council including the Prime Minister, Adrien Sibomana. On Nov. 23, 1991 while Pres. Buyoya was on a visit to France some 270 people were killed in simultaneous attacks by rebels that continued for several days in some of the regional provinces. By Jan. 1992 the death toll was estimated to be some 550 with 10,000 mainly Hutu refugees. On Jan. 4, 1992 the Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire agreed to reactivate permanent security commissions while on Mar. 9, 1992 a referendum on a draft constitution resulted in overwhelming support for changes that included multiparty politics. In Mar. 1992, some 30 soldiers thought to be in pay of ex-Pres. Bagaza unsuccessfully attempted a coup and in April former hard line Tutsi minister Cyprien Mbonimpa was arrested for his alleged involvement in the plot. On Apr. 17, 1993 Pres. Buyoya signed a decree setting June as the date for Burundi's first democratic multiparty elections. The elections resulted in Melchoir Ndadaye of the Democratic Front being elected as President, the first Hutu to become head of state, although demonstrations followed by disgruntled Tutsi. On June 29, 1993 legislative elections resulted in a Tutsi woman, Sylvie Kinigi, being appointed Prime Minister of a carefully balanced government. On Oct. 21, 1993 a Tutsi inspired attempted coup resulted in the death of Pres. Ndadaye while Kinigi sought refuge in the French embassy. Waves of ethnic violence followed the attempted coup with thousands of Hutu and Tutsi being killed and whole villages being burnt to the ground while some 800,000 refugees had fled."
