        "text": "On June 7, the Central Bank of the Republic of Burundi began issuing modified, upgraded banknotes in the denominations of 5,000 and 10,000 Burundi Franc (BIF). They are part of the country’s 2022 series, and both notes are dated 7 November 2022.\n\nThe upgraded notes are printed on the ENDURANCE™ substrate by Crane Currency. This material provides a strong foundation of cotton fibers infused with AST, a chemical that imparts additional strength as well as resistance to and soil and moisture.\n\nThe design and security of the new 10,000 Franc note\n\nThe color scheme of the new 10,000 Franc note is rose (pink), a change from the yellow/brown color of the previous version.\n\nFront Side\n\nBack Side\n\nFront side: Portraits of Prince Louis Rwagasore and former President Melchior Ndadaye; geometric ornaments in the background; pale green horizontal lines at top and bottom; an image of a Nile hippopotamus; in the stylization of the seal, the Burundi coat of arms surrounded by the country’s motto: UBUMWE – IBIKORWA – AMAJAMBERE (Unity – Work – Progress); the national flag; and identification marks (horizontal lines). Also at the left edge are five raised (tactile) squares arranged vertically; this feature helps visually impaired and blind consumers identify the denomination.\n\nBack side: The primary motif is the contour of the country, filled with plants. There are also green horizontal stripes, at the top and bottom of the note.\n\nSecurity features\n\nAs in the previous version, a Rapid® security thread and SICPA SPARK® Live are the main security features.\n\nTwo important changes (compared with the previous 2018 series) are:\n\nThe note’s dominant color is now pink with two horizontal stripes in green.\n\nA modernized watermark is now visible in an oval shape.\n\nThe design and security of the new 5,000 Franc note\n\nThe color scheme of the new 5,000 Franc note is grey. The previous version was primarily blue.\n\nFront Side\n\nBack Side\n\nFront side: The primary motif is of dancers with drums; background with geometric ornaments; pale rose (pink) horizontal lines at top and bottom; the image of an African buffalo; within the stylized seal is the coat of arms of Burundi surrounded by the country’s motto: UBUMWE – IBIKORWA – AMAJAMBERE (Unity – Work – Progress); and the national flag. At the left edge are markings (four squares, arranged vertically) to help visually impaired and blind consumers identify the note’s denomination.\n\nBack side: The primary image is the contour of Burundi, around a landscape scene; and pale rose (pink) horizontal lines at top and bottom.\n\nSecurity features\n\nAs in the previous version, a Rapid® security thread and SICPA SPARK® Live are the main security features.\n\nThree important changes (compared with the 2018 series) are:\n\nThe note’s dominant color is now grey with two horizontal stripes in rose.\n\nThe color of the security thread is now grey instead of blue.\n\nA modernized watermark is now visible in an oval shape.\n\n2018 versions of these denominations withdrawn from circulation\n\nBanknotes in denominations of 5,000 and 10,000 Burundi francs dated 04/07/2018 were withdrawn from circulation on 07/06/2023 and ceased to be legal tender on 18/06/2023.\n\nSources/References:\n\nCentral Bank of the Republic of Burundi\n\nBanknote Industry News\n\nNotafilia"
