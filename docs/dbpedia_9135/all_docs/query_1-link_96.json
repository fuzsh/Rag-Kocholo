        "text": "When you’re sending a high value payment it’s especially important to do your research and find a provider which is safe and which offers low fees and great exchange rates. It’s also well worth comparing some providers based on transfer times, as the delivery time can also vary pretty widely.\n\nSome international money transfer services offer discounts for high value transfers, either through lower fees or a better exchange rate. Use the Exiap cost comparison calculator to make sure you’re getting the very best deal available for your specific transfer.\n\nChoosing an international money transfer service can feel like a risk. However, our comparison tool will only ever recommend secure providers which operate within the law in any part of the world they’re in.\n\nWhen you’re looking for the safest ways to send money to Burundi from United Kingdom you’ll usually want to look out for providers which are registered with and operate under the FCA. In some cases operators may also be regulated by the PRA. And if you’re sending money with your bank, you may also read about the FSCS. Too many acronyms? Let’s look at what they mean.\n\nFCA - Financial Conduct Authority - almost all financial activities have to be authorised by the FCA. The FCA's job is to regulate and oversee financial activities to make sure standards are upheld and financial businesses are trading safely and legally.\n\nPRA - Prudential Regulation Authority - the PRA exists to make sure banks, building societies, insurance companies and other similar financial institutions are being managed safely, to control risk and keep customer money safe.\n\nFSCS - Financial Services Compensation Scheme - the FSCS protects customers when their bank, insurer or other eligible financial service company fails. You may be able to get compensation through the FSCS to make sure you don't lose out if your bank goes bankrupt or runs into other financial difficulties.\n\nThe exact cost depends a lot on where you’re sending money, how much you’re sending, how you want to pay, and how you want the payment to be received.\n\nTypically sending money directly to a recipient’s bank account using a specialist service can be done with fairly low costs, while traditional bank transfer fees can be higher. Paying for your transfer with either a credit card or cash can often mean the fees crank up, too.\n\nWhen you’re sending money internationally, don’t forget that the overall fee you pay can include the transfer fee, an extra charge wrapped up in the exchange rate used, and third party charges like a cash advance fee from your credit card issuer.\n\nThe best rate available to send money to Burundi will usually be the mid-market exchange rate. The mid-market exchange rate is the rate used when banks buy and sell currencies on global markets.\n\nHowever, this rate isn’t always available to individual customers sending money abroad. Instead, providers often add a markup - an extra fee - to the exchange rate they offer customers. This pushes up the costs and makes it harder to see exactly what you’re paying for your international bank transfer.\n\nRight now, the mid-market rate for a Pound Sterling to Burundi Franc is 3730.91.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best provider for sending money to Burundi from United Kingdom, it really depends on what your needs are.\n\nThe cheapest provider shown in our comparison table is Remitly and the fastest is Remitly. If the transfer time is what you're interested in, then Remitly is the fastest to transfer money to Burundi. Remitly can get your money to your recipient to Burundi in 0-2 Days.\n\nIf safety is what interests you the most when it comes to picking the best international money transfer provider to Burundi, then all the providers we listed above are regulated by different financial institutions and should be safe to send money to Burundi with."
