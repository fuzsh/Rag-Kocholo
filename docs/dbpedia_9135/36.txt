The Burundi Franc (BIF) is the official currency of Burundi, a small, landlocked country in East Africa.

Burundi is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and southeast, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.

The currency is issued and managed by the Banque de la République du Burundi, which is the Central Bank of the country.

The symbol for the Burundi Franc is “FBu,” but it can also be abbreviated as “Fr” or “Fbu.”

The Burundi Franc is a floating currency, which means its value relative to other currencies is determined by market forces, including supply and demand, as well as political and economic factors in Burundi.

The absence of a fixed exchange rate against other currencies allows the Burundi Franc to fluctuate based on these factors.

The Central Bank of Burundi is responsible for issuing and managing banknotes and coins in the country.

Banknotes are available in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 Francs. Coins are issued in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 Francs.

The Burundi Franc does not have any subdivisions into smaller units.

The country relies heavily on agriculture, which accounts for a significant portion of its GDP and employs a large percentage of the population.

These challenges have contributed to inflation and depreciation of the Burundi Franc over time, causing the currency’s purchasing power to erode.

As a result, the Burundi Franc may not be widely accepted or easily exchanged outside of the country.
