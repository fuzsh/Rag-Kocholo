Burundi, in long form the Republic of Burundi (in Kirundi: Republika y'Uburundi), is a country in East Africa without access to the sea but with a large shoreline on Lake Tanganyika, located in the region of Great lakes and bordered to the west by the Democratic Republic of Congo, to the north by Rwanda and to the east and south by Tanzania. The territory was colonized in 1885 by the German Empire before becoming part of the Belgian colony of Ruanda-Urundi following the First World War.

In 1960, the Belgian Congo gained its independence and Ruanda-Urundi was the last Belgian possession in Africa and a new currency was then issued, the Ruanda-Urundi franc, which lasted until 1964, two years after the respective independence of Burundi and Rwanda in 1962. The currency was then replaced by the Rwandan franc in Rwanda and the Burundian franc in Burundi.
