Seaside heliotrope (Heliotropium curassavicum) is an attractive flowering perennial that's also called salt heliotrope. Seaside heliotrope grows throughout the US. In California, it is commonly found near water sources, in alkaline or saline soils. This plant has a creeping growth habit, although it can grow to around 1.5 ft in height. The leaves and stems are thick and fleshy. The small, bell-shaped flowers grow along curved stalks and are white with yellow centers that turn purple as they mature.

Seaside heliotrope is not generally known for its fragrance, unlike other varieties of heliotrope which are famous for their sweet, almond-like scent. But the blooms are attractive to bees and butterflies, making it a worthwhile addition to the pollinator garden. It grows in full or partial sun in a variety of soil types and does best with occasional supplemental water. It can also be a container garden plant.
