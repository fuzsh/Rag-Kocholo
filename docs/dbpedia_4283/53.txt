Heliotropium curassavicum * Salt Heliotrope

Heliotropium curassavicum blooms Spring into Summer and may still be blooming into the Fall in good conditions. The small white flowers of the Salt Heliotrope with yellow centers may have hint of lavender or in selected varieties rich purple flowers. The flower centers darken as they age. Heliotropium curassavicum is native to much of the Americas and can often be found in other parts of the world as well. The Salt Heliotrope requires moisture and will spread rather enthusiastically in wet sections of the garden. Heliotropium curassavicum grows 1-2 feet tall and sprawls as far as the moist ground permits. The plants will not tolerate being submerged in a pond for long but love the wet zone next to a stream or pond. Heliotropium curassavicum grows in full sun to light shade. The Sara Orangetip and California Common Ringlet will periodically drop by for some nectar.
