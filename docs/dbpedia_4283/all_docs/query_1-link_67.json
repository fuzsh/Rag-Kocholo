It is approximately 22 acres and reaches a height of 160 ft. The outer slope is steep and precipitous with sparse vegetation and the inner slope is less steep and is where most of the vegetation grows. It is home to Portulaca molokiniensis, an endemic, federally listed endangered species. Harsh winds keep woody vegetation from growing no more than one or two meters. Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), dominates the islet. Near the landing are a few non-native species, such as sourgrass (Digitaria insularis) and Boerhavia (Boerhavia coccinea). Non-native portulaca species (Portulaca pilosa and Portulaca oleracea) are scattered about the islet, mostly in open areas. Also scattered about the islet are tree tobacco and koa haole. Native species, such as Pa‘ū o Hi‘iaka (Jacquemontia ovalifolia subsp. sandwicensis) and ilima (Sida fallax) are also found scattered about the islet. The diversity of plants increases in open areas not dominated by buffel grass. Along the lower portions of the islet, close to the ocean, a few native species were found, including ‘ena‘ena (Heliotropium curassavicum), ‘ākulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum), and ‘ōhelo kai (Lycium sandwicense). ‘Ua‘u kani (wedge-tailed shearwaters or Puffinus pacificus) are the main residents, accompanied by ‘iwa (frigate birds or Fregata minor) which are often observed soaring over the islet.\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting Molokini is prohibited. The sanctuaries are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young. Turtles and seals can rest on their tiny shores without harassment and the sanctuaries are havens for native insects and plants without people constantly inadvertently bringing in weed seeds and other alien pests. Respect and admire these places through binoculars, peacefully, from shore.\n\nActivities\n\nNo activities are possible on Molokini Islet without a permit (see below). Rules regarding activities in the waters around Molokini are regulated by the DLNR Division of Aquatic Resources (as well as relevant federal or other entities).\n\nTo fish for, take, or possess any fish by trolling in Subzone B only.\n\nTo possess in the water any knife and any shark billy, bang stick, powerhead, or carbon dioxide injector.\n\nWith a permit, to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by law for scientific, propagation, or other purposes.\n\nTo engage in commercial activities, excluding the taking of marine life, with a permit.\n\n(Source: State of Hawaiʻi Division of Aquatic Resources)\n\nPermits & Rules\n\nThis sanctuary is CLOSED, per administrative rules Chapter 126 (Wildlife Sanctuaries).\n\nCommercial activities are prohibited.\n\nOther activities (like scientific research, conservation management, or subsistence, traditional, and customary practices by Native Hawaiians consistent with the long-term preservation of the wildlife sanctuary resources) may be possible with a permit.

It is located a short distance offshore south of Hāna. The islet is a cinder cone and has a central sloped section, with sheer cliffs on the south and west side, a few ridges on the east side which protrude from the central cindery section toward the sea, and a small cinder and boulder beach between the two ridges. Vegetation on ʻAlau is made up primarily of coastal plants dominated by naupaka (Scaevola taccada) and ‘ākulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum) with patches of nanea (Vigna marina), alena (Boerhavia repens), ‘īhi (Portulaca lutea), and schiedea (Schiedea globosa). There is a grove of about a dozen niu (coconuts or Cocos nucifera) on its summit. The west tip has some lantana (Lantana camara) with nanea and love-in-a-mist (Passiflora foetida) sprawling over the area. Just below, on the sheer west cliffs, a few rare native plants exist, including numerous schiedea and several maia pilo (Capparis sandwichiana). The slopes are predominantly naupaka and grasses including Henry’s crabgrass (Digitaria ciliaris) and wiregrass (Eleusine indica), with scattered pōpolo (Solanum americanum), pigweed (Portulaca oleracea), sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) and pualele (Emilia fosbergii).\n\nThe near ocean areas are blanketed with ākulikuli, alena, and ‘īhi. The rare ‘īhi (Portulaca villosa) has been found on the windswept cinder ledges on the east side along with the native sedge (Cyperus phleoides). Most of the islet is heavily burrowed by ‘ua‘u kani (wedge-tailed shearwaters or Puffinus pacificus), especially near the top of the islet. Koa‘e kea white tailed tropic birds (Phaeton lepturus dorotheae) and ‘iwa (frigatebirds or Fregata minor palmerstoni) may nest there. Many noio (black noddies or Anous minutus melanogenys) and‘akekeke (ruddy turnstones or Arenaria interpres) can be seen.\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting ‘Alau is prohibited. They are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young. Turtles and seals can rest on their tiny shores without harassment and they are havens for native insects and plants without people constantly inadvertently bringing in weed seeds and other alien pests.

Pu‘u Ku is about 1.3 acres in size and reaches a height of about 60 ft. Pu‘u Ku is a mix of cinders and lava flows, part of the East rift of Haleakalā, and is barely detached from the main island. The islet is covered on the west side by ironwood (Casuarina equisetifolia) with a mix of naupaka (Scaevola taccada), maia pilo (Capparis sandwichiana), and ‘ānaunau (Lepidium bidentatum var. o-waihiense) on the steep north and east sides. The summit is a mix of sourbush (Pluchea carolinensis), ‘ūlei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia), lantana (Lantana camara), laua‘e (Phymatosorus grossus), and naupaka (Scaevola taccada). Hala (Pandanus tectorius) is found scattered about the islet. Up to a thousand ‘ua‘u kani (wedge-tailed shearwater or Puffinus pacificus) burrow under the ironwood grove on the west side of the islet. Koa‘e kea (white-tailed tropic bird or Phaeton lepturus dorotheae) may nest there. Long legged ants (Pheidole megacephala) and unfortunately, hala scale (Thysanococcus pandani) have been found there.\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting Pu‘u Ku is prohibited. They are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young. Turtles and seals can rest on their tiny shores without harassment and they are havens for native insects and plants without people constantly inadvertently bringing in weed seeds and other alien pests.

Moku Mana is a long shaped islet about 1.1 acres in size and about 65 ft. high. The lower portions are wave worn. The vegetation on the top flattish area of the islet is made up of a fairly dense low grass, herb, and shrubland. There are large patches of wiregrass (Eleusine indica), ‘ākulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum), and naupaka (Scaevola taccada). In between these large patches and on margins are occasional lantana (Lantana camara), christmas berry (Schinus terebinthifolius), pōpolo (Solanum americanum), ‘ihi (Portulaca lutea), pigweed (Portulaca oleracea), and pualele (Emilia fosbergii). ‘Ūlei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia) is found on the sheer windward slopes, along with a few native sedges, including Carex wahuensis and Cyperus phleoides. ‘Ākulikuli drapes down the slopes. Additional native plants include ko‘oko‘olau (Bidens hillebrandiana subsp. polycephala), button sedge (Fimbristylus cymosa), and itchy crabgrass (Digiteria setigera).\n\nMany seabirds can be seen nesting or resting on Moku Mana: ‘ua‘u kani (wedge-tailed shearwaters or Puffinus pacificus) on top of north islet; noio (black noddies or Anous minutus melanogenys) nest on sheer walls; ‘ūlili (Heteroscelus incanus), ‘a (brown boobies or Sula leucogaster plotus), and ‘iwa (frigatebirds or Fregata minor palmerstoni) also frequent the islet.\n\nInvertebrates on the northern vegetated side include: honey bee (Apis melifera); native naupaka moths (Udea littorea), Hyleus bees, and Hawaiian beet webworms (Spolodea recurvalis). Aliens have found the islet such as crazy ants (Paratrechina longicornis), praying mantis, and Tornatellid snails (Tornatellides sp.).\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting Moku Mana is prohibited. They are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young. Turtles and seals can rest on their tiny shores without harassment and they are havens for native insects and plants without people constantly inadvertently bringing in weed seeds and other alien pests.

It’s just 0.2 acres in size and about 55 ft high. The southern side and upper portions of the rock are covered mostly by naupaka (Scaevola taccada) with occasional patches of grass (Digitaria spp.) and sedges (Carex wahuensis). ‘Ākulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum) is found lowest/closest to ocean. Wave action prevents plants from growing on the northern side and lower portions.\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting Moku Hala is prohibited. They are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young. Turtles and seals can rest on their tiny shores without harassment and they are havens for native insects and plants without people constantly inadvertently bringing in weed seeds and other alien pests. Respect and admire these places through binoculars, peacefully, from shore.\n\nActivities\n\nNone.\n\nPermits & Rules\n\nThis sanctuary is CLOSED, per administrative rules Chapter 126 (Wildlife Sanctuaries).\n\nCommercial activities are prohibited.\n\nOther activities (like scientific research, conservation management, or subsistence, traditional, and customary practices by Native Hawaiians consistent with the long-term preservation of the wildlife sanctuary resources) may be possible with a permit. Individuals interested in permits should review the detailed information on our Permits & Guidelines page and contact their local DOFAW office.\n\nSome Native Plants & Animals\n\nThese are examples of native species associated with this site.

Itʻs heavily vegetated. Native plants include ‘ūlei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia) growing on the narrow ridge top, with two lama (Diospyros sandwicenis). A thick tangle of christmas berry (Schinus terebinthifolius), hala (Pandanus tectorius), lantana (Lantana camara) and two young Port Jackson figs (Ficus cf. platypoda) battle for space. Scattered under the canopy are laua‘e (Phymatosorusgrossus). The sides of sheer slopes are slightly less vegetated and include naupaka (Scaevola taccada), native sedges (Cyperus phleoides and Carex wahuensis) and other species, such as makou (Peucedanum sandwicense) found closer to the upper portions of sheer walls and ‘ākulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum) closer to the lower wave worn sections. Numerous nest burrows show the islet is home to ‘ua‘u kani (wedge-tailed shearwaters, Puffinus pacificus) and native insects.\n\nAs with all state Seabird Islet Sanctuaries, visiting Keōpuka is prohibited. They are rare places where seabirds can nest with few or no predators and no large mammals (including humans) trampling and crushing the burrow where they raise their young.

This islet is one of six seabird sanctuary islets that is protected by the Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW). Unlike the other islets, Papanui O Kane has no vegetation and is often washed over the waves from high surf. As a result, this islet would be expected to have less seabird activity compared to other seabird sanctuary islets. Due to Papanui O Kane’s status as a seabird sanctuary, it is closed to the public.\n\nActivities\n\nNone.\n\nPermits & Rules\n\nThis sanctuary is CLOSED, per administrative rules Chapter 126 (Wildlife Sanctuaries).\n\nCommercial activities are prohibited.\n\nOther activities (like scientific research, conservation management, or subsistence, traditional, and customary practices by Native Hawaiians consistent with the long-term preservation of the wildlife sanctuary resources) may be possible with a permit.
