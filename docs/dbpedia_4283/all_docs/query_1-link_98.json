        "text": "In this study, methanolic extract of Heliotropium dasycarpum was assessed to explored for its biological and pharmacological activities. For antibacterial, antifungal and phytotoxicity activities 11bacterial, 10 fungal and 4 weed plant species were used respectively. Plant showed inhibition zone against only 3 Bacterial (Chlamydia trachomatis, Î²-hemolytic streptococci and Corynebacterium diphtheria) and four fungal species (Pneumocystis jiroveci, Cryptococcus neoformans, Zygomycetes and Microsporum canis) at maximum inhibitory concentration like; 60, 120 and 240 mg/ml and no inhibition zone was noted with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10, 20 and 30 mg/ml. Phytochemical investigation exposed the occurrence of plant alkaloids, cardenolides, saponnins, flavonoids, enzymes, terpenoids and pigments. Results also indicated that H. dasycarpum had important phytotoxic activities. Plant designated maximum inhibition for the growth of Lemna minor L. (100 %) and Eichhornia crassipe...\n\nEthnomedicinal practices used in better health treatment system from ancient time. Phytomedicines are now an essential area of better treatment and high prospects in many nations. It is less expensive as well as has better cultural and societal recognition, has better feasibility with the human physiological system and has decidedly fewer side effects. Heliotropium indicum Linn. (Family-Boraginaceae) an annual herbaceous medicinal weed and it is commonly known as Indian heliotrope. It is not only a common weed but also it is an important medicinal herb, too. These medicinal herbs are found in tropical and temperate parts of the world along with India, Bangladesh, and some other African countries. Extensive literature studies suggested that the various parts of the plant are reported to possess anti-microbial, anti-tumor, anti-tuberculosis, antiplasmodial, anti-cataract, anti-fertility, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, analgesic and histo-gastro protective properties. Many pyrrolizidine categories of alkaloids have been separated from this particular medicinal plant. Maximum alkaloids which are isolated from Heliotropium indicum are toxic effects and for that reason use of Heliotropium indicum in internal therapy is not recommended. External methods to cure wound healing and skin infections are less risky, still much more research study is needed. The present review study deals with natural habitat, pharma phytochemical screening, botanical, taxonomical and other critical biological aspects of Heliotropium indicum. The main phytochemicals found in this plant are tannins and alkaloids. The present review may be helpful for identification and preparation of a clear monograph of Heliotropium indicum.\n\nObjective The in vitro studies on phytochemical analysis and antioxidant activity of Heliotropium indicum Lin. (Boraginaceous) was evaluated by different assaying. Methods The in vitro antioxidant activity was evaluated for total antioxidant activity, 1,1-diphenylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Results The percentage of inhibition of the total antioxidant activity, DPPH radical scavenging and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was varying from ethanol and aqueous extracts. Conclusion The results clearly indicate that the ethanol and aqueous leaf extracts of the study species is effective in scavenging free radicals and has the potential to be a powerful antioxidant.\n\nIn the present study, the ethanolic leaf extract of Heliotropium indicum L (H. indicum L) was investigated for phytochemical screening and antipyretic activity in rats using Brewer&#39;s yeast induced Pyrexia. The leaves of H. indicum were collected from different part of Assam and cut into small pieces and shade dried. The dried powdered leaves (100 gm) were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus by using 95% ethanol. Phytochemical screening has been done by standard procedure and showed the presence of alkaloids, glycoside, carbohydrate, phytosterol, flavonoids and saponins and absence of fixed oil and gums-mucilage. Albino rats weighing (200-250g) were taken for the experiment divided into four groups of six animals each. Group 1 received 3% aqueous suspension of gum Acacia (1ml/200g) as vehicle orally, group 2 and group 3 received ethanolic leaf extract of H. indicum 250 and 500 mg/kg with 3% aqueous suspension of gum Acacia orally and the group 4 served as standard received paracetam...\n\nThis study aims to compare five species of Heliotropium collected from Jazan region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This comparison was carried out on basis of morphology, pigments content, proteins, total phenolics, flavonoids as well as their antioxidant activity. According to similarity matrix and cluster analysis, H. longiflorum and H. zeylanicum were closely related while H. pterocarpum and H. zeylanicum were distantly related species. The variation in pigments content of the five studied species of Heliotropium was obvious. H. zeylanicum recorded the highest content of pigments while H. bacciferum was the lowest. Moreover, H. jizanense and H. pterocarpum had almost similar pigments content. Proteins, phenolics and flavonoids showed noticeable variation among the tested species. In other words, H. zeylanicum and H. bacciferum had the highest contents of proteins, phenolics and flavonoids and H. jizanense had lowest and the difference was significant. Meanwhile, the total antioxidant activity was variable among species. Higher antioxidant activity was detected in H. zeylanicum (93%) and H. bacciferum (84%) while H. pterocarpum (34.5%)."
