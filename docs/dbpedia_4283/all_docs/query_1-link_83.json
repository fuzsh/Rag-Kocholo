        "text": "<p>Sand Verbena (Abronia latifolia) is a species of the Four O'Clock Family (Nyctaginaceae) native to the west coast of North America, from Santa Barbara County to the Canadian border, where it grows on beach dunes and sand dunes of coastal bars, river mouths, spits along the immediate coastline (0-10m elevation). Its National Vegetation Community Status (NVCS) is the Ambrosia chamissonis herbaceous alliance (dune mat). It grows in succulent mats where it has room to spread. It is an important plant in helping to stabilize dunes and resist erosion. It grows from a stout, fleshy root structure which are edible, traditionally eaten by the Chinook Indians. When stressed it will die back to the root, to sprout again when conditions are more favorable. It has attractive neatly-rounded heads of small, bright golden flowers and small, winged fruits. The individual flowers have no petals being composed of yellow bracts forming a trumpet-shaped calyx about the stamens. If given the proper conditions it will flower most of the year. It is geared for salt spray and will not tolerate regular water nor extreme drought.</p>\n\nAbronia umbellata (Pink sand verbena) is a flowering and ornamental. Plant native to the western United States. Other common names include Beach Sand Verbena and Purple Sand Verbena. Abronia umbellata is a prostrate. Perennial or annual, with thick, succulent leaves. Leaves are slender, may be either smooth or hairy, and oval ore diamond-shaped. Stems are as long as leaf blades, and often hairy. Plant has pink to purple colored flowers with white centers. Generally found in sandy, well-drained soil in areas with low precipitation, it can become a striking carpet-like groundcover in undisturbed areas after winter rains. Pink Sand Verbena tolerates seaside conditions and is found on the west coast of the North America from British Columbia, Canada to Baja California, Mexico. Sand Verbena is typically found on beaches and sand dunes blooming throughout most of the year. Flowers occur in clusters subtended by 5-8 lance-shaped leafs. A. umbellata frequently hybridizes with other species of Abronia, including Abronia maritima. Its flower is fragrant at night and attracts moths. The foliage can be deciduous based on environmental stress. This plant is a popular native plant for landscaping in California.\n\n<p>Box elder (Acer negundo), sometimes called boxelder, is a type of maple tree commonly found growing in moist areas near streams and rivers. Box elder is a deciduous tree with pinnate compound leaves (small leaflets that branch out of a single stem). The leaves turn yellow in the fall. Clusters of small flowers appear in spring. The flowers on female trees develop winged fruits called samaras. The flowers attract pollinators and the seeds provide food for birds and small mammals.</p><p><br></p><p>Box elder is an attractive tree that provides shade and visual interest in the landscape. Some gardeners prefer male box elders because they are less messy than female trees. Gardeners should also be aware that this tree sends out suckers which can become weedy and invasive. This fast-growing tree needs a large planting area as it can reach over 50 ft tall - and nearly as wide - when mature. It also requires a moderate to high level of moisture, including weekly supplemental irrigation in summer.</p><p><br></p><p>Box elder gets its name from its wood, which is used to make boxes and crates. The wood pulp is used in paper making. Like other maples, the tree's sweet sap can be cooked into a syrup.</p>\n\nDeer Plant (Acmispon glaber) is a perennial subshrub in the Fabaceae (Legume family). The plant is a pioneer species found in dry areas of California, Arizona, and Mexico. It is grows in many habitats, including chaparral, coastal sand, roadsides and other disturbed areas at elevations below 4900 feet. <br><br>The stems are green, erect, somewhat branched, with small, deciduous leaves. When this plant blooms, from about March to August, it displays small yellow flowers bunched together in a flower cluster. The flowers become reddish with age. The fruit consists of a curved pod with two seeds. <br><br>There are two recognized varieties with overlapping ranges. Fortunately it is widely available, and would be a great addition to any garden. It has excellent habitat value, and because it is nitrogen-fixing it is often used in restoration projects. Sometimes the wrong variety is planted in an area. Intermediates between the varieties have been observed as a result of such plantings.\n\nLotus junceus is a species of legume known by the common name rush deervetch. It is endemic to California, where it is known from the northern and central coast and the coastal mountain ranges. It can be found from beaches inland to serpentine slopes and chaparral. It is a hairy, prostrate or spreading perennial herb lined with leaves each made up of small oval leaflets. The flower cluster bears up 8 yellow pea-like flowers each up to about a centimeter long. The fruit is a small beaked legume. The fruit beak curves a lot, the keel can exceed the wings, the calyces are entirely red sometimes, and the stems can be darker.\n\nLotus strigosus is a species of legume known by the common name strigose bird's-foot trefoil. It is native to the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico, where it is known from many types of habitat, including disturbed areas. This is a prostrate annual herb. It is sometimes roughly hairy as its name suggests, but it may be somewhat woolly, fuzzy, or nearly hairless as well. Its slender branches are lined with leaves each made of several small leaflets. The flower cluster bears one or two yellow to orange or red pealike flowers, each with a corolla one half to one centimeter across. The fruit is a legume pod 1 to 3 centimeters long.\n\nChamise, or Greasewood, (Adenostoma fasciculatum), a member of the Rose family, is a flowering plant native to California and northern Baja California. This shrub is one of the most widespread plants of the chaparral biome, sometimes forming monotypic stands. <br><br>Chamise is an evergreen shrub with dry-looking stick-like branches. The leaves are quite small, sprouting in clusters from the branches. Its leaves are shiny with flammable oils, especially in warmer weather. Chamise is said to be highly flammable but can be more fire-resistant with occasional watering. The branches terminate in bunches of white tubular flowers. <br><br>Chamise is one of the best plants for anchoring a slope and resisting erosion, due to its wide-spreading and deeply-penetrating roots. In maturity, it develops a large burl from which it will resprout after fire or severe pruning. In the wild, it is the host plant of a common root parasite, Chaparral Broomrape. <br><br>There are three recognized varieties of this plant. Adenostoma fasciculatum var. fasciculatum is found throughout the range of the species. Adenostoma fasciculatum var. obtusifolium is found only in San Diego and Orange Counties. Adenostoma fasciculatum var. prostratum, a low-growing form, is found primarily on the northern Channel Islands. A cultivar known as 'Black Diamond' (Adenostoma fasciculatum 'Black Diamond') is popular and widely available. <br><br>To learn more about this species and its close relative, Red Shanks (Adenostoma sparsifolium), visit the Jepson Herbarium's YouTube channel and watch a short video: <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3G8MlSzo1A\n\nAgoseris apargioides is a species in the sunflower family, is commonly called seaside agoseris or seaside false-dandelion. It is native to the Pacific coast of the United States from Washington to central California, where it grows primarily on coastal dunes. Agoseris apargioides is a low-growing, perennial herb with milky or orange sap, that may be stemless or with long, rhizome-like stems that are buried by drifting sand. The leaves form low rosettes on the ground. They are slender to broad, up to 15 centimeters long, and usually with 3-5 pairs of lobes along the margins (these sometimes lacking). The peduncle of the inflorescence can be as tall as 45 centimeters but is usually much shorter. The flower head is up to 2 centimeters wide, surrounded by glabrous to hairy phyllaries, and contains yellow ray florets (the outer ones often have a purple strip on the lower surface) but no disc florets. The fruit is an achene between 5-12 millimeters long; the lower part of the achene contains a single seed, while the upper portion of the achene forms a slender beak that possesses a terminal, white pappus.\n\nAgoseris grandiflora is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common names bigflower agoseris and grassland agoseris. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California to Utah, where it grows in many habitat types. This is a perennial herb producing a basal patch of leaves of various shapes reaching maximum lengths of 50 centimeters. There is usually no stem, but there is sometimes a rudimentary one. The upright part of the plant is actually the peduncle of the flower cluster, which can approach a meter in height. It is coated in soft white hairs. The flower head at the top is up to 4 centimeters wide and lined with reddish or purplish green phyllaries with curling tips.\n\nAgrostis pallens is a species of grass known by the common name seashore bent grass. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Montana to California, where it grows in many types of habitats. In California it is widespread except for the central valley and deserts. It is a perennial grass growing 10 to 70 centimeters in height, sometimes from a rhizome. The leaves vary in width and length but are generally not more than 5 centimeters long. The flower cluster is a narrow array of thin branches bearing small clusters of spikelets, each spikelet being just a few millimeters long. <br/><br><br>This is a native grass that can be used as a lawn substitute. It has a deep green color, medium leaf blades, can be mowed if desired, requires half the water of non-native lawn grasses, and tolerates some foot traffic. If mowed, the look would be similar to the edge of a golf course fairway; if not mowed it will have a meadow look. This grass is becoming more available through commercial seed vendors as people look for alternatives to non-native lawn grasses.\n\nAmbrosia acanthicarpa is a species of ragweed known by the common names flatspine burr ragweed, annual burrweed, and annual bur-sage. This spiny, weedy plant grows in clumps of many erect stems which may reach over a meter in height. Its gray-green stems are covered in a coat of stiff, bristly hairs. The few rough leaves are several centimeters long. The racemes of flowers are more plentiful, with each hairy flower head a few millimeters wide. The spiny, burr-like pistillate heads have pointed, twisting leafs and the staminate heads are rounded. This ragweed is native to western North America. It is adaptable and grows well in disturbed areas, easily becoming weedy.\n\nAmbrosia chamissonis is a species of ragweed known by the common names Silver Burr Ragweed, Silver Beachweed and (Silver) Beach Bur(r). It is known from most of the coastline of western North America from Alaska to Baja California, where it is a resident of beaches and other sandy coastal habitat. This is a large, sprawling perennial herb exceeding three meters in maximum width. The stems are roughly or softly hairy and longitudinally ridged. The plentiful leaves are a few centimeters long, woolly and silver-green, and variable in shape. The plant is monoecious, with male and female flowers on each individual. Staminate (male) flower heads containing many pale colored florets occur at the tip of the flower cluster, with pistillate (female) flower heads clustered below them. Each pistillate head contains a single tiny flower which develops into a fruit. The fruit is a brown bur up to a centimeter wide covered in sharp spines.\n\nAmbrosia psilostachya is a species of ragweed known by the common names Cuman ragweed, perennial ragweed, and western ragweed. It is native to most of North America including all of southern Canada, nearly all of the continental United States, and the northern half of Mexico. It is a common plant in many habitat types, including disturbed areas such as roadsides. It can be found in parts of Eurasia as an introduced species. This is an erect perennial herb growing a slender, branching, straw-colored stem to a maximum height near two meters, but more often remaining under one meter tall. Leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and vary in shape from lance-shaped to nearly oval, and they are divided into many narrow, pointed lobes. The stem and leaves are hairy. The top of the stem is occupied by an flower cluster which is usually a spike. The species is monoecious, and the flower cluster is composed of staminate (male) flower heads with the pistillate heads located below and in the axils of leaves. The pistillate heads yield fruits which are achenes located within oval-shaped greenish-brown burs about half a centimeter long. The burs are hairy and sometimes spiny. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting up from a creeping rhizome-like root system. This plant had a number of medicinal uses among several different Native American groups.\n\nAmsinckia spectabilis is a species of fiddleneck known by the common names seaside fiddleneck and woolly breeches.

Amsinckia spectabilis is a bristly annual herb similar in appearance to other fiddlenecks. The leaves are sometimes edged with fine teeth. The coiled inflorescence holds tubular yellow flowers up to 2 centimetres (0. 8 in) long and 1. 5 centimetres (0. 6 in) wide at the face.\n\nArctostaphylos crustacea is a species in the Ericaceae (Heath) family known by the common name Woollyleaf Manzanita. It was formerly considered a subspecies of A. tomentosa but has recently been elevated to species status. A. tomentosa remains as a distinct species. This shrub is endemic to California where it is a resident of chaparral canyons, foothills, and lower-elevation mountains from the San Francisco Bay region to Los Angeles County. One specialized habitat in which it is found is the Monterey Cypress forests at Point Lobos and Del Monte Forest in Monterey County, California. This is a low-lying, spreading Manzanita, generally quite a bit wider than it is tall. It is a variable species with six recognized subspecies. Some of the subspecies can vary in appearance across individuals. The stems may be red or gray or both, with smooth, rough, or shreddy bark, hairless to quite bristly. The leaves may be oval to lance-shaped and sometimes toothed, but the upper surface is generally darker and shinier than the lower. The flowers are white to pink and may be hairy or hairless inside. The fruits are fuzzy reddish drupes under a centimeter in diameter.\n\nArctostaphylos hookeri is a species of manzanita known by the common name Hooker's manzanita. This shrub is endemic to California where its native range extends from the coastal San Francisco Bay Area to the Central Coast. This is a low shrub which is variable in appearance and has several subspecies. These are generally mat-forming plants or low bushes with small green leaves, dense flower clusters of white to pink flowers, and shiny egg-shaped or round red drupes. It does not form a burl and can be killed by fire.<br><br>Hooker's Manzanita comes in a number of subspecies and cultivars. Two low growing, mounding forms include ssp. hearstiorum and Monterey Carpet (about 1 foot tall and 6 feet wide). Upright forms can reach 6 feet in height. In general, this species prefers full sun within a few miles of the coast, and part shade when more inland. This plant will tolerate some summer water (1-2x per month).

It is a perennial grass growing in clumps 0.5 to 1.5 meters tall, with many narrow leaves up to 40 centimeters long. The flower cluster is a spreading or drooping array of flat spikelets longer than they are wide. The grass is wind-pollinated but is also sometimes cleistogamous, so that the flowers pollinate themselves, especially under stressful conditions. It also reproduces vegetatively via tillers. This grass is used for control of erosion and revegetation of damaged land, as well as a highly palatable forage for livestock. In the garden it has a reputation for being short-lived but readily re-seeds. It completes well with non-native weeds, and its sod-building root system makes it useful for erosion control.\n\nCalystegia macrostegia is a species in the Convolvulaceae (Morning Glory) family known by the common name Island Morning Glory. It is found on the Channel Islands and also on the mainland coast from Monterey County southward into Baja, Mexico. It is a woody perennial vine which may be a low and herbaceous or a stout, climbing plant which can approach 9 meters in length. The triangular leaves may be over 10 centimeters wide. It blooms over a long period, producing white to very pale pink blooms with corollas 2 to over 6 centimeters wide. <br><br>There are six recognized subspecies with overlapping ranges. There is also a commonly available horticultural variety known as 'Anacapa Pink'. It works best with a fence, trellis or something it can climb on, but can also be used as a ground cover. It grows so vigorously that it may need to be cut back annually. Plant in full sun along the coast. Inland give afternoon shade and additional water.\n\nCamissonia strigulosa is a species of flowering plant in the evening primrose family known by the common name sandysoil suncup. The plant is native to California and Baja California, where it grows in sandy areas, such as beaches, mountain sandbars, and the Mojave Desert. Camissonia strigulosa is an annual herb with a tough, slender, hairy stem which may grow erect or lie along the sand. It approaches 50 centimeters in maximum length and is lined with small, thin green to red linear leaves with tiny bumpy teeth along the edges. The flower has four yellow petals a few millimeters long which may have red spots near the bases. The fruit is a long, very thin podlike capsule containing tiny seeds.\n\nCamissonia micrantha is a species of flowering plant in the evening primrose family known by the common name miniature suncup. It is endemic to California, where it grows along the coast and in the coastal mountains as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as in the Central Valley. It grows in sandy areas in a number of habitats, from beaches to inland slopes. This is a small, hairy annual herb producing a basal rosette of leaves. The stem varies in morphology, approaching half a meter in erect height or quite short and flat, with or without branching. The larger leaves are located in the basal rosette; those on the stem are narrow and shorter. The flower cluster produces bears a number of flowers with petals less than 5 millimeters long. They are bright yellow and dry to a reddish color as they close. If the flower cluster is located on an erect stem it bends the stem over with its weight. The flowers self-pollinate. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule 1 to 2 centimeters long.\n\nCardamine californica (Milkmaids) (also Dentaria californica) is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, native to western North America from Washington to California and Baja California. It is common in a variety of habitats including shady slopes, open woodlands, chaparral and grasslands in the winter and early spring. In the San Francisco Bay Area, it is one of the first wildflowers to bloom, with blossoms from January to May. Cardamine californica is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to about 1 foot tall. The flowers are produced on a spike, each flower about 1/2 inch in diameter with four white petals. The flower closes its petals in late afternoon as the sun goes down and nods its pedicel before a rain, protecting the pollen. Hand pollination of two milkmaids populations in the San Francisco Presidio improved seed set from 8% to 85%, with seeds ripening in about 53 days.\n\nSand Dune Sedge (Carex pansa) is a member of the Sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a grass-like perennial with triangular blades and clusters of dark brown nutlets as flowers. <br/><br/>Butterflies and moths use Dune Sedge flowers for nectar. Small shore birds may use sedges and rushes for hiding and nesting. <br/><br/>Dune Sedge naturally grows in the Sand Dune plant community along the west coast. <br/><br/>Although this Sedge is sometimes recommended as a lawn substitute, it grows best in sandy soil, with regular water and no more than light foot traffic. Use Dune Sedge for coastal gardens with sandy soil and to create habitat for coastal wildlife.\n\nCarex pellita is a species of sedge known by the common name woolly sedge. It is native to much of North America, including most of the United States and southern Canada. It grows in wet and dry areas in a number of habitat types, including disturbed areas such as ditches and roadsides. This sedge grows in colonies of individuals made up of clumps of stems 30 centimeters to one meter tall from a network of spreading rhizomes. The flower cluster is up to 30 centimeters long, a cylindrical body of overlapping flowers. Female flowers have dark brown or purplish, hairy scales with long tips. The fruit is coated in a fuzzy to woolly perigynium.\n\nClustered Field Sedge (Carex praegracilis) is a species in the Cyperaceae (Sedge) family. It is native to much of North America, from Alaska across southern Canada and throughout the continental United States, except for the southeastern region. <br><br>It grows in wet and seasonally wet environments in a number of habitats, including meadows and wetlands; it is often riparian or semi-riparian in the drier parts of its range. It tolerates disturbed habitat such as roadsides and thrives in alkaline substrates. <br><br>This sedge produces sharply triangular stems from a network of thin, coarse rhizomes. The flower cluster is a dense, somewhat cylindrical array of flower spikes. <br><br>The plant is often dioecious, meaning that an individual plant will bear male or female flowers in its flower clusters but not both. It spreads readily by rhizomes. In the garden, it can be useful in poorly draining areas, in the spaces between pavers, and as a replacement for non-native lawn grasses. It has a soft texture, can be mowed, and requires significantly less water than turfgrass."
