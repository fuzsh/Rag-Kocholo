        "text": "We have an online wildflower field guide that is designed to help you identify desert wildflowers by color, scientific name, region and common name. The pictures are sized to work on the iPod, iPhone, iPad and similar devices. With your iPod or phone you will easily be able to identify wildflowers while in the desert. Links for downloads are on the bottom of the Wildflower Field Guide page.\n\nPhoto tips: Most digital point-and-shoot cameras have a macro function - usually symbolized by the icon of a little flower.
