        "text": "Native plant identification key for the\n\nPalos Verdes Peninsula, California\n\nLeaves cuneate (wedge-shaped) narrow at base, fanning out to an obtuse or rounded tip, ~1-4 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, short petioled (very short stem attaching leaves to main stems). Leaves are mostly cauline (on the stems), arranged alternately, often with new stems or whorls of new leaves in the leaf axils. Leaf is slightly concave upward. Inflorescence is a solitary or paired spike without bracts (leaves), ~2-10 cm long, scorpioid (coiled like a scorpion's tail), with flowers densely attached in pairs. Flowers are small (~0.3-0.6 cm across), white, with corollas divided into 5 symmetrical ovate lobes, which are often folded lengthwise along a midrib, making the petals concave upward. The center of the flower is usually yellow or lavender, often on the same cyme (flower spike), with 5 stamens visible deep inside the corolla. Bloom from March to October. The fruit is a glabrous round nutlet ~0.1-0.2 cm in diameter. The plant itself is a perennial herb usually 10-50 cm tall, diffusely branched and sprawling. Favors either dry or moist sites and is common in saline or alkaline soils.\n\nHeliotropium curassavicum (Boroginaceae): heliotrope or salt heliotrope or seaside heliotrope or Chinese parsley\n\nCalfora Taxon Report 4060 and county map\n\nCalphotos images\n\nJepson Manual treatment and floristic province map\n\nFirst placed on web: 07/28/11\n\nLast revised: 07/28/11\n\nChristine M.

Thanks also to the students in sections of biogeography, introductory physical geography, GDEP, and LSAMP for \"test-driving\" various editions of this key."
