        "text": "HelpLog In\n\nBoraginaceae\n\nAsteridae: Lamiales. The Boraginaceae are herbs, shrubs or trees comprising about 100 genera and 2,000 species that have flowers in helicoid cymes and often have herbage that is coarsely hairy. The leaves are simple, mostly entire, and alternate; stipules are lacking. The flowers are nearly always bisexual and actinomorphic. The calyx consists of 5 distinct or connate sepals. The corolla is 5-merous, sympetalous, and often has small appendages in the throat. The androecium consists of 5 distinct stamens adnate to the corolla tube or perigynous zone and alternate with the corolla lobes. The gynoecium consists of a single compound pistil of 2 carpels, a single, often gynobasic style, and a superior, often deeply 4-lobed ovary with 4 locules, each containing a single basal-axile ovule. An annular nectary disk is sometimes present. The fruit consists of 4 1-seeded nutlets or a 1-4-seeded nut or drupe.\n\nEach \"thumbnail\" image below is linked to a larger photograph."
