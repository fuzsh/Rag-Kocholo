        "text": "In mid-August, I visited friends who have a beach house in Crystal Beach, a small, mostly weekender, community on Bolivar Peninsula, a landform part of the network of barrier islands along Texas' Gulf coast. This beach is in close proximity to Houston, but is less developed than Galveston, which is just across the bay.\n\nTypical of Texas beaches, with the exception of South Padre, the water is muddy and the sand is pretty brown. But for someone who can count on one hand how many times they've been to a warm-weather beach, it was a treat. Although the weather was not that cooperative, I was still able to observe a lot of great native Texas species of flora, and many are unique to coastal areas.\n\nI was inspired by the number of colors and textures at the beach and created an arrangement from what I observed. Many of these blooms are short-lived and aren't ideal for cutting, but they did create a nice composition, and an even better example of what all grows just a few feet from the house."
