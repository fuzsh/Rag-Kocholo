        "text": "Two organophosphate (OP) insecticides (Chlorpyrifos and Fenitrothion) and one synthetic pyrethroid insecticide (Deltamethrin) were evaluated against 4 instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) under laboratory condition. The larvae were collected from nearby area of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202 campus and reared at the Insect Biotechnology and Biopesticide Laboratory of Department of Entomology. For bioassay, five concentrations (viz. 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90ppm) of each of the insecticide were prepared. Ten actively swimming 4 instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus were added into respective concentration. Mortality was recorded and the LC50 and LC90 values were determined by probit analysis. The LC50 values for Fenitrothion, Deltramethrin Chlorpyrifos, and were found to be 8.88, 26.73 and 71.14ppm, respectively. Thus, the Fenitrothion exhibited comparatively higher toxicity about 3 and 8 times more toxic compared to deltamthrin and chlorpyrifos...\n\nThe knowledge of how herbicides affect mosquito ecology and behavior is confined. This study evaluated the toxicity of six selected herbicides in comparison with one insecticide (thiamethoxam+ chlorantraniliprole) on 4th instar larvae of Culex pipiens after 24, 48, and 72-h exposure. Plus, this study investigated the biochemical effects of these pesticides on 4th instar larvae using sodium dodecylsulphate-total protein (SDS-total protein) technique. As a result, thiamethoxam+chlorantraniliprole was the most toxic pesticide among all tested pesticides (LC50 was 0.0083, 0.0016, and 0.0004 µg/ml after 24, 48, and 72-h exposure, respectively) while mesosulfuron-methyl+iodosulfuron-methyl is considered the most potent herbicide among the evaluated herbicides (LC50 was 0.67, 0.45, and 0.36 µg/ml after 24, 48, and 72-h exposure, respectively). Clodinafop-ropargyl+ pinoxaden, diclofop-methyl, bromoxynil octanoate, and fenoxaprop-p-ethyl were demonstrated to be of moderate toxic herbicides on the mosquito larvae. In biochemical studies, new bands of protein were found rather than those in the control. For instance, Three new bands with molecular weight of approximately 41, 22, and 19 kDa were detected in Culex pipiens larvae samples treated in the same of these herbicides with glyphosate isopropylamine, diclofopmethyl, and mesosulfuron-methyl+iodosulfuron-methyl. Future studies should be conducted to investigate the mechanisms of the selected herbicides that induced changes in mosquito to get better comprehension of these functions.\n\nMosquitoes in general and Culex quinquefasciatus in particular have for a long time been a source of nuisance due to diseases they transmit, punctures and annoying buzzes. They are also a public health problem. That is why this study aim to find a biopesticide that can fight effectively but also be an alternative to persistent chemical pesticides in the environment. Thus, we decided to control the mosquito larvae of Culex in the wild with biopesticides suneem1% alone, Metarhizium anisopliae alone and their mixture. To arrive at this we determined the lodgings and determine their physicochemical conditions. We also evaluated larval densities before and after treatment with the ladle technique. This methodology allowed us to have results. The lodgings of Pikine, Kaffrine and Goudiry gave mortalities greater than 50% in 2 days. Suneem alone, Metarhizium anisopliae alone gave mortalities, but the formulation of these two biopesticides is more effective with high mortalities in 2 days. T...\n\n— The present study was planned to test on certain chemical insecticides from different groups such as organophosphates, pyrethroids and Bioinsecticide. Among these compounds two were chemical insecticides (Propetamphos and Cypermethrin), while the third one is Bioinsecticide (Baciloid 5000: Bacillus thuringiensis) against Culex pipiens, the dominant mosquito species in Abha city. Taking LC50 values (concentration which to kill 50% of mosquito larvae) into consideration, mosquito larvae of CX. Pipes against Propetamphos was effective (LC50 0.0162 ppm) against the 3rd instar of the laboratory strain comparing with a field strain which was 0.0442 ppm. At LC90 level, data indicated that Propetamphos (LC90 0.8109 ppm) was effective insecticide against the 3rd instar larvae of laboratory strain, while against field strain gave (LC90 3.31 ppm). Similarly, the results clearly showed that Cypermethrin was also very effective insecticide (LC50 0.0132 ppm) against the adult females against laboratory strain, while against field strain Cypermethrin gave (LC50 0.1192 ppm). On the other hand, the residual activity of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis reached from 4 to 20 days of concentrations ranged between 0.001 to 100 p.m. in case laboratory strain, while reaching between 6-23 days of concentrations ranged between 0.001 to 100 p.m. in case field strain. Mortality percent was also found between 11.7 to 96.8% of concentrations ranged between 0.001 to 100 p.m. against laboratory strain in the 1st week, whereas ranged between 0.0 to 70.8% in the 2nd week against the same concentrations finally ranged between 0.0 to 12.7% in the 3rd week. Hence, the field collected larvae of Culex pipens were more susceptible and have prolonged residual effect as compared to laboratory reared. Keywords— Evaluation of insecticides against Culex pipiens, in Abha city.\n\nThe irritant effect of some insecticides can cause a proportion of mosquitoes to leave the sprayed rooms before acquiring a lethal dose, so the repeated contact al sub-lethal dose may lead to extent the resistance. Larvae and pupae of Culex pipiens complex were collected in mass from open canals of waste water in capital city Tehran and reared to obtain the first generation at laboratory. Sugar-fed 2-3 days female mosquitoes were used for the experiments and compared with laboratory strain. The irritability tests of insecticides impregnated papers were measured in plastic conical exposure chambers placed which implemented at controlled conditions according to the method described by WHO. Number of take-offs were counted during 15 minutes of exposure time. DDT had the most irritancy effect against field population of Cx. pipiens. DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin was moderately irritable against laboratory strain, whereas, addition to three previous insecticides, malathion, cyfluthrin..."
