A species may utilize the range during different times of the year or different stages of their lifecycle. A species’ depicted range can over-estimate the area occupied due to the inclusion of non-habitat areas. Species distribution models are created to identify suitable habitat within their range and are not displayed on this map.\n\nSpecies’ ranges included on the Idaho Species Catalog originate from a variety of sources. Some are created in house by intersecting verified or trusted observations with a hydrologic unit boundary to depict range extent.\n\nIn accordance with our terms of use for this site, you agree to this disclaimer"
