        "text": "“I wonder if that tree feels the same way I did,” I said to Rowshan as I snapped a photo of some of the mistletoe that grew in big bunches on an ironwood tree (Olneya tesota) next to the Yaqui Well trail in Anza-Borrego.\n\nA couple weeks ago we got back from a trip to Costa Rica and found we had brought an unintentional souvenir: giardia. It took about two weeks to figure this out for sure. For those two weeks I felt exhausted, had no apetite, and when I forced myself to eat anything substantial, suffered dearly for it.\n\nI had heard mistletoe is a parasite can eventually kill its host. However, according to Live Science, this is not true, or it takes a long time (60–70 years), or the tree has to be weakened by other things like disease or drought. In the meantime the mistletoe steals minerals and water from its host, but also uses photosynthesis (which makes it a hemiparasite since it doesn’t rely completely on its host). I guess the tree just struggles through life feeding itself and its parasites until it dies. And I thought two weeks of hosting a parasite was bad.\n\nThe mistletoe I saw was desert mistletoe (Phorodendron californicum). It has reddish berries and grows on several trees/shrubs in the fabaceae family including desert ironwood and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana). Also in this area we saw several phainopeplas, the males of which are pretty shiny black birds (females are gray) with a crest, red eyes and splashes of white under their wings. These birds rely on the mistletoe for food during the winter. They eat the berries and poop out the seeds, thereby spreading the mistletoe to other trees.\n\nThe ironwood and mesquite trees in the Yaqui Well area host other non-parasitic entities as well. And it was one of these that brought us to the trail. While I had been sick in bed, Rowshan had gone with friends to Yaqui Well and seen “at least 20” long eared owls. They returned with pictures of adorable owls with long feather tufts on their heads. They were long-eared owls (Asio otus).\n\nTo ensure a sighting, we first had stopped at the Tamarisk Grove campground to visit the resident long eared owl. “This one is really used to people so you can get really close,” Rowshan told me. “The ones near the trail are more skittish and would fly before you get that close.” Sure enough, the owl was in the exact same spot near campground 18 where it was last week. But this week there was a second one as well. They looked small compared to barn and great horned owl, but also tall and skinny—even more so due to their long ear tufts. We were able to stand right under the tree and look at them. And they looked back at us.\n\nWhen we’d first seen the ironwood with the mistletoe Rowshan said, “The owls could be in any of these trees,” We didn’t see any. We walked up a wash and saw another ironwood tree. “That’s where I saw them before. There is one in the middle.”\n\nWe observed the tree from a distance and managed to find three. “You’ll see. There are probably a bunch hidden.” We got a little closer and I saw one more. It was like one of those picture games where you have to find how many things were hidden. Then one that I hadn’t seen flew. Then a couple more. By the time we reached the tree about ten owls had flown and three remained. Some of the owls had flown up the wash to another tree.\n\nAfter walking up the wash for a bit, we turned back and followed the trail to a grove of ironwood trees closer to the road where we saw more owls flying. Seeing this number of owls was a treat since a year or so ago we’d asked at the campground about a resident owl and the ranger said it hadn’t been seen for a couple years, speculating the drought had reduced the rodents that they fed on, so they had to go elsewhere.\n\nSpring in San Diego is the time for fabulous fabaceae flowers. I was looking forward to writing about the pea family because there are so many pretty flowers to illustrate it with. They are blooming like crazy. The banks of Lake Hodges are covered with white and yellow sweet clover. Purple spears of lupines have shot up along the highway and hot pink wild pea flowers dangle from chaparral trees.\n\nPea flowers are very easy to identify. They have 5 petals: one big one at the top that makes a sail (called a banner), 2 to the side that are called the wings, and 2 that are fused together to make the keel.[1] Basically, the pea flower looks like a magic flying boat. The flower sizes range from large wild pea (Lathyrus vestitus var. alefeldii) flowers to the many tiny flowers that make the clover head’s “petals.” Their leaves are often pinnate which means they are made up of 2 opposing rows of leaves, though lupine leaves have a very recognizable palmate form where the leaves radiate from a central point. Another notable feature is their pea pods.\n\nFabaceae makes up the 3rd largest land plant family behind Orchidaceae and Asteracea. The name comes from the Latin Faba which means beans[2] (think of the redundant fava beans).\n\nThe first local pea I noticed last year was Astragalus trichopodus var. lonchus. It has funny bulbous pea pods. I was really excited when I looked it up because I had just learned that Astragalus is an excellent immune system builder in Asian medicine. In a perfect example of knowing just enough knowledge to be dangerous, I didn’t realize at the time that there were about 3000 different species of astragalus plants[3]. A bit of research quickly revealed that many of the American astragalus plants contain toxins. Astragalus trichopodus has the common name of coast locoweed. Some locoweeds produce a toxin called swainsonine which poisons livestock. Others are poisonous because they accumulate selenium.[4] Another astragulus plant in San Diego is the Parish milkvetch (Astragalus douglasii).\n\nWhen I think of lupines, I think of gorgeous photos of snow-capped Mt. Ranier, a bright blue sky, and meadows of purple lupines. (Unfortunately, I don’t have a photo of it.). Lupines can be recognized even when they are not in bloom by their palmate leaves. There are several lupines in San Diego. We found miniature lupines (Lupinus bicolor), Bajada lupines (Lupinus concinnus) and stinging lupines (Lupinus hirsutissimus).\n\nCertain types of lupines have edible beans (or rather edible after processing). They were eaten in ancient Rome, but they seem to be making a comeback. One web site that called them “miracle beans” and listed various conditions they purportedly helped with.[5] According to www.lupini.us, they are second to only soy beans as a great source of protein for vegetarians and contain “the full range of amino acids.”[6] However, since the beans contain toxic amounts of alkaloids they need to be specially processed.\n\nOf course, there are peas, beans, and peanuts in the Fabaceae family, but I didn’t find any growing in the wild, or in my garden since I didn’t plant them this year.\n\nThere are fabaceae trees as well. I couldn’t help but notice an Acacia saligna—Willow Acacia next to the World Beat Center ethnobotanical garden. I’ve seen them from a distance in other places as well. I glanced at it without realizing it was a fabaceae since its pom-pom flowers didn’t look pea-like at all. It is an invasive plant, as is the cyclops acacia which I found in the Tijuana River area. Both came from Australia. There is also the western cowboy BBQ evoking mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana) The beautiful smoke tree (Psorothamnus spinosus) and indigo bush (Psorothamnus schotti) are both found in the desert and have beautiful purple flowers.\n\nClovers are secret Fabaceae plants. Their clover flowers are not actual flowers but rather bunches of tiny flowers. Sometimes they are so small it is hard to tell they are individual flowers rather than petals. Red clover has been used for a variety of health purposes including as an expectorant, for skin problems, as an anti-inflamatory and even as a cancer treatment. In other places I’ve lived there was red clover all over the place. Here I could only find some sad white clover in park lawns.\n\nThe main native clover species here is the sweet clover. Instead of round heads of tiny clover flowers, the flowers grow on a stalk. This flower has been used by Native Americans for colds, a bed bug repellant, for pimples, and for sunburn. [7] White sweetclover (Meliltus alba), Indian sweetclover (M. indicus), and yellow sweet clover (M.officinalis) can all be found in the San Diego area. Caution must be taken with clovers because they contain coumarins which are the natural compound that the blood thinner coumadin was based on. If the clover becomes moldy, the coumarin can convert to dicoumaraol which can lead to internal bleeding.[8]\n\nPea plants play an important role in the ecosystem. They are nitrogen fixers. This means they have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria that live in nodules on their rots systems and create nitrogen compounds which are used by the plant. When the plant dies this nitrogen is released into the soil and other plants can use it.[9] This mad rush of pea plant blooms which makes the landscape a rainbow, fades and dies and then helps other plants grow. So, even though many of these plants are toxic to humans and animals, they still are important for the world. Perhaps their toxicity keeps them in the ground so they can flower and then go back to the soil and help the other plants.\n\nFabaceaes seem to range from important food staple to important medicine to poisonous. It seems that even though they are plentiful, I probably won’t be harvesting any for personal use or casually nibbling any on the trail. I’ll leave that to the experts. However, enjoying the flowers is always safe.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Elpel, T. J. Botany in a day, the patterns method of plant identification. Hops Press, LLC, 2004.

The trail and earth around the trail are also this pinkish beige color. The green is a bit misleading. It isn’t a green of lush rich damp earth, but a fleeting green sigh left by winter rains and destined to be gone by summer. The ground speaks of a harsher climate, bleached stones crushed into gravely top soil. It’s not quite a desert, but takes a hardy plant to thrive there. The tough needled buckwheat plants, prickly leaved live oaks, tough leaved white sage, and pungent bitter black sage thrive. It isn’t a place for fragile flowers… well…. At least, not most of the time.\n\nBut spring is different. The sun is gentle, there is a bit of dampness in the air, and the chill of the night leaves dew on the ground. So, between the tough bushes there is a fresh fragile layer of plant life… a breath of a meadow. These micro-meadows are filled with fragile flowers in gentle pinks, yellows and purples. Their leaves and petals are tender. Though from a distance it isn’t visible, the whole area is in delicate state of bloom. The sage has sent up shoots of white and pale lavender flowers. The air hums with bees. The buckwheat has pink buds. The ceanothus plants have their bluish purple flowers. It is a little disconcerting when I think about it… like finding out a tough boxing champion writes sensitive love poetry.\n\nRowshan had suggested hiking in Sycamore Canyon. “Maybe there will be some flowers blooming.” The last time we went it was July and it was hot. I agreed. I wanted to do a page about the pea family and there are a lot of pea family flowers in bloom right now. It probably took us 10 minutes to get 20 feet down the trail because we had to stop and photograph so many flowers. There were Parry phacelia (Phacelia parryi), California poppies (Eschscholzia californica), and stinging lupines (Lupinus hirsutissimus). We’d see a single beautiful flower and Rowshan would struggle to get the perfect angle and light. Then a little farther down the trail there would be a whole patch of them.\n\nMost of the flowers were small—their plants less than 10 inches tall. They made me think of old children’s stories about fairies and other little creatures living in a miniature world. I squatted down and looked at the flowers. The plants required a closer look to see the interesting little details of the flowers. Yellow sweet clover had flowers that were so tiny that I couldn’t even see if they had the tell-tale wings and keel petals of the fabaceae family. Purple owl’s clover flowers (Castilleja exserta ssp. exserta) had strange marks like eyes.\n\nIt is so pleasant to come across beautiful things when one isn’t searching for them. We weren’t expecting to see so many flowers. We didn’t even know they grew there. But, there they were. I think perhaps one of the thing we have lost with technology, the Internet and modern life in general, is the element of surprise and the joy of serendipity. Modern society seeks to give you exactly what you are searching for or to persuade you that you want what someone wants to sell you. We must have everything, “On Demand.” Nature, on the other hand, doesn’t care what you want, and she sure isn’t going to try to sell you anything. She is also not about to give you anything “on demand.” But that makes the surprises more treasured. Maybe by next week the flowers will have withered. Or maybe next week they will be out in full force with even more blossoms. There is this delightful lack of control. I guess that is one of the things I like about traveling as well.\n\nAnyway, we descended a hill into the Martha Harville Memorial Oak Grove. There had been a fire at one point and there were several burnt tree trunks, though there were quite a few large live oak trees as well. A Benwick’s wren perched on a burnt tree and sang into the sky, its slender beak wide open. In the shade of the oak trees, miner’s lettuce (Claytonia exigua) flourished. I love the strange way the flowers grow out of the middle of the leaves. The shade of the grove was refreshing. As we reluctantly left the grove, we saw wild onions. I tasted the leaf of one. A Northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) flew into a tree near us.\n\nFarther up the path, I noticed a lizard running. It wasn’t running the way most lizards run, so I suspected it was a horny toad. Sure enough, it was a coast horned lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum). This was the second one we’ve seen this year. This makes me happy because supposedly they used to be all over the place, but up until this year we hadn’t seen a single one in San Diego County. I also like them because they look like mini-ankylosaurusus. On the last leg of the loop, we came upon our first snake of the year: a Southern Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus helleri). It was reclining with its tail in the road. As Rowshan took a photo, it slid into the grass, vibrating its tail in a delicious whirr.\n\nLater, it struck me that we hadn’t seen any sycamore trees, even though the canyon was named after them. “Maybe they burned down in a fire,” Rowshan suggested. It wasn’t until I re-checked the trail information that I realized we’d skipped the part of the trail that went to the actual “Sycamore Canyon.” I guess we will just have to make another trip.\n\nUseful Information\n\nThe part of Sycamore Canyon/Goodan Ranch Preserve we visited is accessed from Poway Road. Even though it looks like you can get there from Scripps Poway Parkway, you can’t. Take Poway Road and continue straight onto Garden Road when Poway Road turns sharply north. Go for a mile or so on Garden and then turn right on Sycamore Canyon Road and follow it until it ends at the park entrance and parking area. Don’t rely on Google Maps for this one.\n\nThe San Diego Reader’s Sycamore Canyon description by the Canyoneers describes the trail including some of the history of the area.\n\nGoodanranch.org is the web site for the Friends of Sycamore Canyon and includes history, photos, events and their newsletter.\n\nCounty of San Diego Sycamore Canyon and Goodan Ranch Preserve page contains basic information including a brochure with a map\n\nOn the weekends, we often find ourselves having a conversation that goes something like this:\n\n“Let’s go hiking.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Where should we go?”\n\n“I don’t know. Where do you want to go?”\n\n“Let’s go to ______.”\n\n“That’s too far.”\n\n“Are there any hikes in San Diego we haven’t been on?”\n\n“I don’t know. Let me check the book.” (the book meaning Jerry Schad’s book, Afoot and afield in San Diego County)\n\nThis time I flipped through the section for south San Diego. There was a small trail that had been traced with a pencil.\n\n“Have you been to Rice Canyon?” I asked.\n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“Chula Vista.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Are you sure? There’s a mark on the map.”\n\n“I don’t think I’ve been there.”\n\nThen technology seeped in. Each of us with our respective computers started looking for information. I put “Rice Canyon San Diego” into a search engine. Rowshan looked at Google Earth. “It looks like it is in the middle of a housing development,” I complained. “Maybe we should go somewhere else. It’s connected to a playground area. It is probably just a place where everyone goes jogging and walks their dogs.” I dug up a Canyoneer’s brochure and started searching until I found another possibility. “We haven’t been to this one.” Rowshan Google Earthed the second trail. “It looks like it has fewer trees than Rice Canyon.” I pulled up a trail map with some photos.\n\nIt was at that moment Rowshan said, “Well if do this for another couple hours, we won’t have to make a decision. We’ll spend the whole afternoon in front of the computers. Let’s just go to Rice Canyon.”\n\n“I guess we won’t know how it is unless we go,” I replied.\n\nWith that we put our computers away, and within a few minutes were out the door and in the car headed to Chula Vista.\n\nThe trailhead was located in a parking lot behind a sign I mistook for a housing development sign. It didn’t look bad at all. There was a cactus garden at the top where some of the flowers were already blooming and lizards skittered among the stones and plants.\n\nWe walked along a gravel road. At the top there was a sign which showed a much larger number of trails than I had thought were there. There was another canyon that we had passed on our way there. It looked like it was possible to hike a loop by hiking through Rice Canyon, going a few blocks up H Street and then turning and meeting up with the beginning of a trail through the second parallel canyon.\n\nNext to the trail were patches of cactus and other plants. Some were nicely labeled with signs. The San Diego sunflowers (Bajiopsis laciniata) were in bloom. So was the coast locoweed (Astragalus trichopodus var. lonchus) with its pea pods drooping like overdone costume jewelry. To the left of the trail were trees and patches of reeds suggesting a riparian area. The birds chirped and sang, invisible to us in the willows.\n\nThe dominant plants of the area were the lemonade berry trees (Rhus integrifolia). Some had buds, some had flowers, and others had berries. Some of these berries were coated thick with a sticky white substance. I knew the Kumayay had soaked the berries to make a lemonade drink, but most of the time I had just seen fuzzy berries. I thought at first it was something from a bug, but then decided it must be the lemony tasting substance that would mix into the water to make the lemonade. I hesitantly touched a berry and the substance felt like icing. I tasted it and to my relief, it was very lemony.\n\nSome parts of the trail had welcome bits of shade provided by pepper trees, which are invasive, but make nice shade trees. We only ran into a few people on the trail. Mostly it was peaceful and quiet.\n\nThe trail met a street, which we crossed, and then went back down into the canyon. This part was shorter and we soon came to busy H Street. This was the unpleasant part of the loop. H is a busy street and the “trail” according to the map sign which I had photographed, was a sidewalk on one or the other side of the street. The cars roared by us on one side as we walked looking at snail filled iceplants on the other. It was a long block before we got to Paseo Del Rey and were able to get away from H Street. Since the reassuring “Rice Canyon Loop Trail” signs had disappeared at the end of the last bit of trail, we had to find the next part of the trail on our own. We poked around and peered down into the canyon. Eventually we backtracked down Plaza Court which led to the Home Depot parking lot. With great relief we saw a metal gate with a sign with a list of prohibitions. We were back on track.*\n\nThis section, known as Snake Canyon, was even quieter than the first part. I guess people don’t combine their hiking trips with home improvement shopping. Soon we came upon a wooden wall of planks with the top angled out from the trail. A biker had been stenciled on it. Later we came upon another wooden structure: a raised ramp with a part that pushed down like a see-saw. It also had a biker stenciled on it. Someone had made a bmx obstacle course. I was surprised that the area was empty because it looked fun and I hadn’t ever seen a public trail set up like this. Though that could be because it isn’t the safest thing to mix a hiking trail with a BMX course.\n\nWhat impressed me most about this trail were the huge lemonade berry trees. A lemonade berry forest stretched up the sides of the canyon. They were the tallest lemonade berries I’d ever seen. I wonder if they could be considered old growth lemonade berry trees. From around a bend in the trail, I heard Rowshan call to someone, “There’s one more up ahead.” Soon a group of BMX bikers came racing through. The last had a bell. They raced quickly causing me to listen even more carefully as I hiked.\n\nThis part of the trail ended up by a fire station. We crossed the street and walked into the YMCA parking lot. From there we caught the last short bit of the trail past a field of flowers (crown daisies, perhaps (Glebionis coronaria)). Crossing another street brought us back to the Rice Canyon entrance.\n\nUseful Information\n\nRice Canyon is located in Chula Vista. From 805, take the East H Street exit, and go east for around 3 miles. Turn left on Paseo Ranchero and then right on Rancho Del Rey Parkway. The Rice Canyon trailhead parking lot will be on your left, across the street from Discovery Park.\n\n* http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=747066 Everytrail.com has a map of the loop showing how you can cut through the parking lot instead of walking up H Street. There may be some paths from the west end of the parking lot into the canyon as well making it possible to avoid the parking lot.\n\nThe suburbs make me uneasy. They aren’t lively and diverse enough to be a city and aren’t wild enough to be nature. I think it is the walls, housing developments and chains that bother me the most. Interesting how the word chain can mean a metal linked device that literally binds you, or a business that hopes to figuratively bind you. Either way, it’s not very nice.\n\nHowever, I tolerate the San Diego suburbs because if I make it through them I can get to some nice hiking areas. There is the highway, then the suburbs, and finally, beyond that, the open spaces stretch into hills as a reward.\n\nWhen Rowshan and I both used to work in Rancho Bernardo, we would sometimes go hiking in the Blue Sky Ecological Reserve after work. It was a nice way for us to change gears and let the work day dissolve. We would watch for birds of prey soaring above us and stink bugs at our feet looking like they were trying to break dance.\n\nThe past couple days have been beautiful hiking weather. It poured down rain last week and now the weather is sunny, clear and clean. The pounding heat has finally dissipated. I suggest doing the hike from Blue Sky, past Lake Poway and up Mt. Woodson. It is a good hike of 10 or so miles. But we decide that’s too much and opt for a less ambitious loop from Blue Sky to Lake Poway, around the lake, and then back.\n\nThe laurel sumac berries are mostly dried up but the sugar bush berries are just starting. The 2 bushes look very similar with oval leaves that fold down the middle making them resemble green taco shells. However, the berries are different. The sumac has little torches of berries while the sugar bush berries are larger, flatter and furry growing off pinkish scaled stalks. A little down the path, we turn onto the Creekside Trail. This is a quiet trail alongside a damp area (the creek). “It smells so good,” R says. There’s a smell of cool dampness mixed with sage scrub. Ragweed, mugwort and poison oak line the trail. Above, huge live oak trees make a canopy. There are also willows. I stop for a while to examine the plants. I’ve been trying to learn to identify various Artemisia plants, especially mugwort. It is an interesting plant that is used in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, European and Native American herbal medicine.[i] In fact, it is so interesting, I think I’ll have to write a different blog post about it. I don’t think common mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) grows in So Cal; but there are several other species of Artemisia. I find Douglas Mugwort (Artemisia douglasiana) and Palmer’s Sagewort (Artemisia palmeri). There is also a lot of Coastal Sagebrush (Artemisia californica) I get a little frustrated because I keep seeing ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) and thinking it is an Artemisia plant.\n\nAs I try to sort out my Artemisias and Ambrosias, a hummingbird whizzes by and settles, wings out stretched a couple feet away from me on the mugwort. Before I can get my camera, it whizzes off again. Then I notice another bird rustling in a tree. Then I hear birds beginning to chirp. I have been there long enough for the birds to feel comfortable enough to come out. I watch a yellow rumped warbler picking at a worm or piece of a plant. A lizard scampers down a nearby tree. A jay calls from above. Little chirps and twitters drift down from the light speckled tree tops. A small bird that looks as grey and soft as a mouse, maybe a female yellow rumped warbler lands on some sumac and proceeds to pick at the berries. A little farther down the path a plain titmouse (Parus inornatus) clambers on a tree branch, accidentally flipping upside down. In the underbrush and dry leaves, I barely catch a glimpse of a wren like bird hopping along the ground. These are subtle little birds colored grey and browns so they can remain hidden in the branches. As other people walk by, they again disappear and the path became silent.\n\nAbove me on the main path, I can hear people jogging by or casually walking and talking loudly. Sometimes I step aside for people to speed by me blind to everything around them. It occurs to me that so many people are in a state of self-desensitization. <RANT> We wear headphones or blast loud music, slowly making ourselves deaf. We use perfumes and air fresheners to block the smells. We deaden our eyesight staring at computer and TV screens. There are even “augmented reality” glasses that alter our vision of what’s around us adding things that are not there to what is really there. We blast ourselves with sensory overload until we learn to tune everything out. And touch? I think a lot of people are afraid of touching things because they worry about germs or unfamiliar consequences. I think people remark on how beautiful something is but are a lot less likely to comment on how it feels… except maybe clothing. And taste? OK we are Americans; we like to eat. However, I think in spite of that, many people are less aware of taste and more aware of quantity. We’ve blasted our taste buds with salt and sugar, so end up reacting to addiction more than taste. Of course there are many people who are paying attention to the taste of food, especially with the slow food and local food movements. However, I think the average person takes the taste of food for granted. I only realized how not all tomatoes were equal when after moving to California from Turkey I was shocked to find an abundance of tomatoes in supermarkets with no taste. It struck me that everyone in Turkey, even those without much money, eats better produce than the average middle class American. </RANT>\n\nAs I’ve been studying plants, I have started to pay more attention to senses that perhaps I don’t use as much as I should. So, back to Blue Sky. As I stare at a ragweed and an Artemisia plant, trying to notice the differences, I realize, “Duh! Smell them!” The ragweed has a fairly ordinary generic plant smell. The Artemisia is minty, with the slightest bitter tone. It is cooling. It’s smell is obvious. I can’t believe I hadn’t compared the smells until this point. The Artemisias don’t smell exactly the same but the smells have similar tones. I think the Douglas mugwort is more medicinal smelling than the sagebrush. I tasted the Douglas mugwort and found it way too bitter.\n\nI catch up with Rowshan and we make our way out of the willow shade and up to the Lake Poway dam. The water level is quite low judging from the 2 distinct colors of stone on the banks. Dragon flies mate resting on water grasses and the brush around the lake. After the walk up the hill in the hot sun, it’s refreshing to sit on the sand next to the lake in the shade of a small willow. This part of the lake is full of coots who make funny honking squawks as they paddle about, streaking in waves away from the rowboats.\n\nWe head back to Blue Sky and come across a huge lizard in the middle of the trail. He is so still, I wonder if he is dead. R slowly brings his camera closer and closer to catch the lizard’s smile. After his photo shoot, he takes off into the brush.\n\nUseful Info:\n\nThe Blue Sky Ecological Reserve is located at 16275 Espola Road\n\nPoway, CA 92064.\n\nHours: sunrise to sunset. Note that the parking lot gate is locked at sunset.\n\nEvents: You can download a schedule of guided walks and other events at the Reserve at http://www.poway.org/Index.aspx?page=676\n\nMore Information: The Friends of Blue Sky Canyon have a lot of information including photos of plants, articles and maps on their web site http://www.blueskyreserve.org\n\nHike: We hiked the main trail (Green Valley Truck Trail) into the reserve, turned left onto the Creekside Trail which joined the main trail again. Then we took the trail to Lake Poway, going right when the trail split to the Mt. Woodson trail. We walked counter clockwise around the lake and then joined the Mt. Woodson trail down to join up with the trail back to Blue Sky.\n\nRules: Please note, bicycles are not allowed in the reserve and dogs must be leashed. Dogs are also not allowed on the Creekside Trail. This is probably because riparian habitats are scarce in San Diego and often nesting places for endangered birds. Dog owners, please respect this.\n\n[i] Wikipedia contributors. “Artemisia vulgaris.” Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 10 Sep. 2012. Web. 21 Oct. 2012.\n\nA few minutes down the trail, we came upon a huge patch of wild roses. Most of the flowers were gone, but the rose hips hung like little red Christmas ornaments. “This must be why it is called Rose Canyon,” I said. I took a bite of one. The dry fruit’s center was full of seeds. I wondered how anyone could get enough fruit to make a batch of jam from these things.\n\nRose Canyon was different from the other San Diego canyons. Tall Matilija poppies (Romneya trichocalyx) with big yellow centers and big white crinkly petals grew just beyond the information sign. These were followed by pink clumps of buckwheat flowers. Then came the roses.\n\nRose Canyon is actually named for Louis Rose who came to San Diego in the mid 19th century. He had various business ventures, but also purchased a lot of land. At one point he owned almost 4,000 acres.[i] Rose had various commercial ventures including mining coal in the canyon and running a tannery.[ii] Before Rose bought the land, it had been occupied in one way or another for 7000 years.[iii] Archaeologists have found evidence of both seasonal settlements and a permanent one. When the Spanish arrived there was a large Kumeyaay village. Later Mexicans called it La Canada de las Yeguas (Canyon of the Mares)[iv].\n\nIt is easy to see why people chose to live in the canyon. It offers a cool respite from the heat of the summer, there is a creek running through (though we couldn’t get close to it until the end of the trail) and a wealth of edible and useful plants. According to the Rose Canyon brochure, the park houses “a very rare riparian habitat.”[v] This and the oak woodland habitat are “fragile, rare and mandatory for the survival of over 100 federally endangered plants and animals.”[vi] Now it is a nature preserve with a dirt path leading under live oaks, elders and sycamores. It isn’t completely quiet since the train track goes through so every now and then the Coaster or an Amtrak train passes by. However, an occasional train is much more endearing than the constant flow of traffic down a highway.\n\nAfter seeing how the summer heat had decimated the elderberries in Mission Trails, I decided the summer hot season was upon us and didn’t expect to find many interesting plants since everything was probably dried up or had already gone to seed. The Rose Canyon summer is milder than other parts of San Diego. The tall oak and sycamore trees cool the area and the elderberries were still going strong.\n\nThe coastal clouds had seeped into the canyon making a comforting blanket of white. Birds chirped from where they hid above us in the tree branches. The poison oak draped itself on trees and bushes making a wall dotted with dangling white clumps of berries. At one flourishing poison oak covered elderberry tree, orioles feasted on berries inaccessible to poison oak shy people. At the base of the tree there was a bee hive. I thought it was interesting that the natural wall of poison oak did more to stop people from going into the sensitive wetland habitat area than the wooden fences with “habitat restoration” signs.\n\nAlong the edge of the trail I noticed pretty purple and yellow flowers. The purple petals were fused together so they resembled bat wings. Little green and yellow fruits dangled from stems. I guessed nightshade. It was White Horse-Nettle (Solanum elaegnifolium) which is in the nightshade family. It is nice to see that my botanical studies are starting to pay off. I also found some salt heliotropes (heliotropium curassavicum). The flowers grow on curled inflorescences which is a sign that they are of the borage family. It is native to both the mainland southwestern states and Hawaii (where it is known as Kīpūkai.)[vii]\n\nTowards the end of the trail, the peace was broken by I-5. We stopped at a bridge to watch red crayfish (probably invasive Procambarus clarkii\n\n(red swamp crayfish)) in a small pond, then headed back up the canyon.\n\nUseful Information:\n\nTo get to Rose Canyon, take I-5 or the 805 to 52. Exit at Genessee. Drive past the canyon and park on the street near the housing developments. When school isn’t in session you may be able to park across from the park in the high school parking lot.\n\nRose Canyon Open Space Park: San Diego City website with pdf of trail map (and parking information).\n\nFriends of Rose Canyon: Information about Rose Canyon and conservation efforts.

Phillip the resident manager had some bad news for us, “As you see, everything bloomed early this year. I saw just one moth and that was a month or two ago. Let’s see… we had a lot of rain in the fall and then nothing. All the plants started blooming because they thought it would be their only chance.” I love the way Phillip seems to know exactly what’s going on in the natural world and why. I guess that’s why he is the resident manager. “You only see them at night anyway,” he added. I felt a little foolish. We were hoping maybe they would be around at dusk. Since we were there anyway, we walked a bit around the sanctuary. As usual, I was glad we did. Even though we didn’t have a lot of time, it was enough to see that it was spring in Silverwood. The Silverwood Sanctuary is full of wild lilac trees, Ceanothus. Right now they are all in bloom. The hillside was covered in purple.\n\nWe walked around a little then headed over to the neighboring Oak Oasis Open Space area which is open until 5PM. The Ceanothus were even more amazing here. The trail wound down a hillside covered in purple. The scent of the lilacs was gentle like the coolness in the air. The sky was a clear blue. Where it ended, a sea of Ceanothus began. It looked like the trees had caught whispy pieces of the sky in their branches. Ceanothus trees are small so we could see billowing waves of their flowered upper branches rolling down the hill. Distant green hillsides were also dusted with purple.\n\nThere are a lot of beautiful things in nature, but their beauty has a harshness and inapproachability like snow capped mountain peaks and wild animals. The lilac forests have a gentility which would make an English gardener jealous. They don’t have the erotic flamboyance of tropical flowers. They don’t have the chaos of wild forests. Instead, their flowers have the primness of lace. They conjure images of Victorian picnics or impressionist paintings. The Ceanothus hillside dipped into an oak forest for which the area was named. Here we could hear California quail rustling and calling.\n\nUseful Information:\n\nBoth the Silverwood Wildlife Sanctuary and the Oakoasis Open Space Preserve are located on Wildcat Canyon Road. From I-8, take hwy 67 to Lakeside, turn right onto Mapleview and then left onto Ashwood which becomes Wildcat Canyon Road. Oakoasis is about 4 miles up the road on the left and Silverwood is about 5 miles up on the right. Silverwood is run by the San Diego Audubon society and is only open to the public on Sundays from 9-4 from approximately October to July.
