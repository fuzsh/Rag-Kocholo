        "text": "On August 31st, spend an ‘Evening in the Hamptons’ at the beautiful East Hampton estate of Ted and Dina Merrill Hartley. The night benefits the New York City Mission Society, also known as the longest running charity in Manhattan (200 years old!) Guests will enjoy food, drinks, fireworks, and special musical guest performances by singer Cole Rumbough and Tony Award nominee Christine Andreas (below).\n\nThis year’s ‘Evening in the Hamptons’ esteemed committee includes philanthropists Lizzi Bickford, Martin and Cornelia Bregman, Jay Moorhead, Charles Bullock, Stanley H. Rumbough, and Jean Shafiroff. All of the proceeds will go to the New York City Mission Society to help break the cycle of poverty for New York’s children, youth, and families. This year they will provide services to more than 7,000 youth and families in Harlem, the Bronx, and Brooklyn.\n\nSinger, Cole Rumbough, is proud to be the 7th generation of his family to be involved in the New York City Mission Society and recently co-founded the “Junior Society” with his friend Brooke Laing. His father, Stanley H. Rumbough, has been on the board since 1983, and his grandmother, Dina Merrill, has been on the board since 1946. When Dina married Cole’s grandfather, her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Colgate, said that “Every new bride should have a charity” and continued the New York City Mission Society tradition."
