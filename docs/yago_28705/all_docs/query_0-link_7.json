        "text": "It would have been pretty difficult for willowy actress/model Dina Merrill to have pulled off playing a commoner on stage, film or TV in her day. She reeked of elegance and class. The epitome of style, poise and glamour, the New York-born socialite and celebrity was born Nedenia Marjorie Hutton on December 29, 1923, the daughter of E.F. Hutton, the financier and founder of the Wall Street firm that bore his name, and heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, of the Post cereal fortune. Although Dina made elegant, elaborate use of her upbringing over the decades, she handled it all positively and graciously without tabloid incidents, instilling these same refined credentials into a large portion of her characters.\n\nDina did not originally intend on an acting career. After studying at George Washington University, she suddenly dropped out after only a year (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents) after demonstrating a late desire to perform. Enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studying with Uta Hagen among others, Dina appeared in the comedy \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" before taking her first Broadway curtain call in \"The Mermaids Singing\" in 1945. She took some time off to play wife and mother to three children after marrying Stanley Rumbough, Jr., heir to the Colgate toothpaste fortune.\n\nDina finally made an official film debut with a smart and stylish support role in the Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn vehicle Eine Frau, die alles weiß (1957). She continued to charm in the same upper crust vein playing some version of the model wife or blue-blooded maven in frequent posh outings. Some of her more noticeable roles came with Unternehmen Petticoat (1959) with the equally classy Cary Grant; Telefon Butterfield 8 (1960) starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey; and Die jungen Wilden (1961) opposite Burt Lancaster.\n\nFollowing her divorce to Rumbough after 20 years, Dina married ruggedly handsome actor Cliff Robertson in 1966. The pair had one daughter and were a popular Hollywood fixture for nearly 20 years. With her film career on the wane in the mid 1960's, Dina gravitated toward TV guest spots on such popular shows as \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Burke's Law,\" \"Rawhide,\" \"Daktari,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"Daniel Boone,\" \"Batman\" (as the villainous \"Calamity Jan\" alongside Robertson's western bad guy \"Shame\"), \"The Name of the Game,\" \"The Virginian,\" \"Night Gallery,\" \"Marcus Welby,\" \"The Love Boat\" and \"The Odd Couple.\" She also graced a number of TV-movie dramas beginning with The Sunshine Patriot (1968) co-starring husband Robertson and Seven in Darkness (1969) (as a blind survivor of a plane crash), and continuing with The Lonely Profession (1969), Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones (1971), Start ins Ungewisse (1972), The Letters (1973), The Tenth Month (1979), and a featured part in the mini-series sequel Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979).\n\nDina returned to Broadway as the co-star of the drama \"Angel Street\" (1975) and again with the revival of the musical \"On Your Toes\" in which she played \"Peggy Porterfield\" in both the 1983 Broadway revival and 1986 national tour. In the same year that Dina divorced second husband Cliff Robertson (1989), she married actor/investment banker Ted Hartley. Together the couple bought RKO Studios and renamed it RKO Pavilion. He serves as chairman and she vice chairperson/creative director. The studio produced such popular efforts as Milk & Money (1996) and the remake of Mein großer Freund Joe (1998).\n\nAdmired for her tireless philanthropic contributions, Dina was a moderate Republican (vice chair of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition), and an active lobbyist for women's health issues. She also devoted much time working for the disadvantaged, particularly for the New York City Mission Society. She remained active and was an avid tennis and golf player for quite some time. Broaching age 90, the ever-glamorous actress appeared in a summer stock production of \"Only a Kingdom\" (2004) and continued to appear in occasional movie and television productions until developing dementia. Dina died on May 22, 2017, at age 93, survived by her third husband."
