        "text": "THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SITS ALONE AWAITING HER next cue.\n\nAnd in the case of that beautiful woman — actress Dina Merrill Hartley — that cue is directing her to art.\n\nMrs. Hartley has quietly turned away from a 60-year acting career that included roles in such classic films as “Desk Set,” “Butterfield 8,” “Operation Petticoat” and “The Sundowners” to focus on her watercolors of birds and flowers.\n\nShe is 87, and art seems to be a logical course for the actress, whose first museum exhibition opens Jan. 14 at the Lighthouse ArtCenter in Tequesta. In the living room of her Palm Beach condo near The Breakers, a sheaf of watercolors sits on the cocktail table.\n\nLike its owner, the room is refined, but not fussy.\n\nThe comfortable sofas are upholstered in a blue and white toile that seems to have taken its cue from Mrs. Hartley’s cerulean eyes. An antique table and antique chairs sit in a dining area, and a vintage secretary stands to the side, while Lucite tables are filled with shells and other objects of the sea that Mrs. Hartley loves so much.\n\nHer handshake is firm as she greets a visitor, and those blue eyes of hers sparkle as her husband, movie producer Ted Hartley, joins her.\n\nThey hold hands as they talk, their eyes occasionally looking east to the Atlantic.\n\nOne could say Mrs. Hartley grew up on the ocean.\n\nBorn Nedenia Hutton, she came of age in Palm Beach, where her mother, Marjorie Merriweather Post, reigned from 1927 to 1973 as queen of the town’s society from her palatial home at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAs a child, Mrs. Hartley traveled the world with her parents — her father was financier E.F. Hutton — on their yacht, The Sea Cloud.\n\nThat brings the couple to a story.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Hutton family was sailing in the Pacific and Marjorie Merriweather Post had a hankering for turtle soup.\n\nThey were near the Galapagos Islands, and had heard about the tortoises there.\n\nSo Mrs. Hartley and her father set out in a longboat to retrieve a tortoise for soup.\n\nMrs. Post had to wait for her soup.\n\n“I liked the turtle so much that I didn’t want him to made into soup,” Mrs. Hartley says. “It was like a real person.”\n\nHer husband corrects her: “It was a tortoise, wasn’t it?”\n\n“What’s the difference?” Mrs. Hartley says.\n\n“Big. Size, primarily,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\nWell, that, and the tortoise is a land animal and turtles live in water.\n\n“That’s another thing,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\n“I didn’t know the difference,” Mrs. Hartley says.\n\nIn any event, she decided that her mother was not going to have tortoise soup.\n\nBut the captain had other ideas, and started planning a menu.\n\n“I was furious and I hid him,” she says of the tortoise.\n\nShe named him Jumbo and kept him in her cabin, much to her mother’s chagrin.\n\nJumbo even took a stroll or two of his own.\n\n“He went onto the aft deck and I rescued him before he could fall overboard,” she says.\n\nThe tortoise didn’t fall overboard, and he obviously had a strong personality, which is something she admires.\n\nE.F. Hutton had that.\n\n“He was true to himself, and his friends,” she says.\n\nAnd creating art is how Dina Merrill Hartley remains true to herself.\n\n“She is a lovely lady. She is the true definition of a lady. She’s just sweet. She’s really caring about people. She’s just a wonderful person,” says her teacher, artist Ted Matz, who also will curate this show for the ArtCenter.\n\nMrs. Hartley began painting in earnest about three years ago.\n\nHer compositions are solid, Mr. Matz says.\n\nThat suggests a confidence in what she is doing.\n\n“There’s no hesitation,” he says. “We work mostly off of pictures. She’ll look at the picture. She spends a lot of time sketching it, and then she starts painting. And a lot of times, I’ll be sitting going, ‘What are you doing?’ It’s like she has her own mind. She knows what it’s going to look like. Nobody else would think that, but she really does know what it’s going to look like.”\n\nMrs. Hartley and Mr. Matz sit together and paint; Mr. Hartley frequently joins them for their lessons. “She’s not pretentious,” he says. “She loves fish. She loves to fish … so she talks about when they used to go out to the ocean and fish.”\n\nThat speaks to her art.\n\nMrs. Hartley looks at a watercolor of a clownfish.\n\n“He’s smiling,” she says.\n\nThat’s one happy fish.\n\n“He likes being a clownfish,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\nMrs. Hartley says she sometimes sees herself in the creatures she is painting.\n\n“Not many people can do that,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\nAnd Jumbo?\n\n“Jumbo was very strong and he had a mind of his own. I was afraid people would throw him overboard. The captain didn’t like him very much,” Mrs. Hartley says.\n\nMarjorie Merriweather Post didn’t like the tortoise very much, either, but that independent streak served Jumbo well.\n\nHe now lives, 70-odd years later, at the Hawaiian Aquarium, Mr. Hartley says. It’s a story that has a happy ending. And what of the Hartleys’ love story? They have been married 23 years, and they can thank Marjorie Merriweather Post for making the introduction. Mr. Hartley was in the Navy at the time, serving as an aide at the White House under President Eisenhower. “The president’s wife said she had a very important guest coming to the White House and she wanted me to personally take care of her. It turned out to be Marjorie Merriweather Post,” he says. “I escorted her into dinner, introduced her to people.” Mrs. Post seemed to enjoy herself. “At the end of the evening, I took her down to her car — roll-up windows in those days. She rolled down her window, and said, ‘Young man, thank you so much for all you have done for me this evening. I had a wonderful time and I wish there was something I could do for you — do you play tennis?’\n\n“I said, ‘Well, I’m a Navy officer, ma’am. Probably not very well.”\n\nMrs. Post was nonplussed.\n\n“‘My daughter and her husband play tennis. You should play tennis with them. I’ll arrange it.’ And that was the way I met Dina Merrill.”\n\nMrs. Hartley was married to her first husband, Stanley Rumbough Jr., at the time, who Mr. Hartley says remains great friends with the couple.\n\nShe later married actor Cliff Robertson, and stayed active, working onstage and onscreen.\n\nShe also was her father’s daughter, serving on the board and the compensation committee of Lehman Brothers for more than 18 years. Her net worth has been estimated as high as $5 billion.\n\nThrough the years Mrs. Hartley has been a big supporter of the arts.\n\n“I like to do that because it’s something different,” she says, downplaying her role.\n\nBut the Guild Hall in East Hampton, N.Y., was only too happy to honor her last year after her family raised $1 million to name the Dina Merrill Pavilion. The Hartleys actually appeared onstage together at Guild Hall.\n\nThis year, Mrs. Hartley will serve as honorary chair of the ArtCenter’s 49th annual Beaux Arts Ball, set for Feb. 9 at Jupiter’s Loxahatchee Club.\n\nMrs. Hartley also is a presidential appointee to the board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a trustee of the Eugene O’Neill Theater Foundation and vice president of the New York Missionary Society.\n\nThat’s the perfect complement to her husband, who after he left the Navy, went on to star in such television series as “Peyton Place” and “Chopper One,” before heading a theater company, trad- ing in commodities and working as a film and theater producer.\n\nNow the chairman of RKO Pictures, he is 76 and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\n“I’m on a springboard. It’s really fun. I’m finally beginning to get things figured out. I’m a late bloomer,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\nThat is a valuable asset, he says.\n\n“The great thing I find about going from green to gray is part of your brain operates faster. I understand people and their motives and what they’re about much more quickly than I did when I was younger. It saves a lot of time and makes life interesting. You have so many more friends and get to know people faster. A few years ago, I always wanted to be quarterback, and now I’m OK with playing any position at all to be part of a team. It’s a different feeling. It’s a lot of fun.”\n\nThe couple also spends time in southern California and in New York.\n\n“Basically, I have a day job in California, and I have every weekend with this gorgeous girl, when she’ll have me — wherever I am in the world. I have this big hit play in London that’s setting records, called ‘Top Hat,’ at the Aldwych Theatre,” Mr. Hartley says.\n\nMrs. Hartley beams as he says that.\n\nHis current film, “A Late Quartet,” with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christopher Walken, has won praise from critics, and he says Mr. Walken deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.\n\nBut right now, it’s his wife who is set to make her debut in a new venture.\n\nAnd forget the Oscar predictions: Ted Matz says Mrs. Hartley has added a certain Galapagos tortoise named Jumbo to her list of creatures to paint. ¦"
