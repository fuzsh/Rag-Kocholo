He did not want the \"good name\" of Hutton paraded on the Great White Way. She asked her father who he disliked more than anyone else in the world . He said Charlie Merrill, the founder of Wall Street competitor Merrill Lynch and thus Nedenia Marjorie Hutton became Dina Merrill.\n\nMerrill acted in twenty-two motion pictures, including Desk Set with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, The Sundowners, Don't Give Up the Ship, Caddyshack II, I'll Take Sweden with Bob Hope, The Young Savages with Burt Lancaster, A Nice Little Bank That Should Be Robbed with Mickey Rooney, Catch Me If You Can, Operation Petticoat with Cary Grant (who had previously been married to her cousin, Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton) and Tony Curtis, The Courtship of Eddie's Father with Glenn Ford and Ron Howard, Butterfield 8 with Elizabeth Taylor, A Wedding with Desi Arnaz, Jr. and Carol Burnett, True Colors with John Cusack and The Player with Tim Robbins and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nMerrill appeared regularly on television in the 1960s, including a guest role in James Franciscus's The Investigators on CBS in 1961 and on the NBC medical drama The Eleventh Hour in the role of Rita Hall in the 1962 episode entitled \"Everybody Knows You Left Me\". Another NBC medical drama Dr. Kildare (1961–1966) saw her guest star as the adult daughter of series regular Raymond Massey in his role as Dr. Gillespie, mentor to the eponymous Dr. Kildare, played by Richard Chamberlain. In 1966, she appeared as extra special guest villainess Calamity Jan on Batman alongside husband Cliff Robertson as her on-screen husband Shame. In 1969 she co-starred with Dean Jagger, Fernando Lamas and Joseph Cotten in the made-for-television suspense film The Lonely Profession. She appeared as a What's My Line? Mystery Guest on the popular Sunday night CBS program, and later appeared on the panel of the syndicated version of that game show.\n\nHer legitimate theater credits include the 1983 Broadway revivial of the Rogers & Hart musical On Your Toes starring Russia prima ballerina and emmigree, Natalia Makarova.\n\nThe actress has been married three times.

Her second husband was the American actor Cliff Robertson (married 1966, divorced 1986); they had one child, Heather Merriweather Robertson (1969–2007). She has six grandchildren: Denia and Welyn Craig, David Colgate (Cole), Allegra Hutton, Siena Post, and Kiera Basten Rumbough. In 1989, she married the former actor Ted Hartley.

She also made guest appearances on Bonanza, The Love Boat, and The Nanny, as Maxwell Sheffield's disapproving and distant British mother. Her stage credits include the 1983 Broadway revival of the Rodgers & Hart musical On Your Toes, starring Russian prima ballerina Natalia Makarova.
