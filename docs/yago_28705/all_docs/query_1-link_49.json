Guest stars: Shirley Knight, Dina Merrill. With Angela Lansbury.\n\nHoi Polloi Meets Hoity Toity\n\nThe Conners get a taste of upper crust living when they visit the wealthy Wentworth family at their home on Martha's Vineyard. The experience proves eye-opening when the Conner family discovers the pill-popping, alcohol-sipping, and irresponsibility of Astrid's dysfunctional family. As the weekend drags on, the Conners give the Wentworths a lesson in real life."
