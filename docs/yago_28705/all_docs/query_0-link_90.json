She was Chairman of the board and Director emeritus with over 50 years of service to the New York City Mission Society. When her son David was diagnosed with diabetes, Dina founded the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, dedicated to diabetic research. She served as the International Ambassador for ORBIS International, the flying eye hospital which teaches advanced eye care and eye surgical techniques all over the world.\n\nMs. Merrill was an energetic supporter of the performing arts. She was a founding trustee of the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center and an early director of the Paley Media Center. She served for 12 years as presidential appointee to the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She was honored by Guild Hall, where she performed on stage for many summers in East Hampton, NY, by the naming of their theater and back theater spaces the Dina Merrill Pavilion.\n\nShe was a trustee of the Hillwood Estate, Museum and Gardens in Washington, DC.\n\nShe also served as a board member of the Population Resource Council and the Republican Majority for Choice Committee promoting “choice” for women and was a founding vice chairman of the Pro-Choice Coalition.\n\nAs a corporate leader, she served as the Vice Chairman of RKO Pictures and was actively involved in many of its productions and activities. She has served on the Board of Directors of E.F. Hutton Company and the Board of Lehman Brothers.\n\nShe is survived by her loving husband Ted Hartley, son Stanley Hutton Rumbough, and daughter Nedenia Rumbough Roosenburg and six grandchildren.\n\nBurial services will be private for the family.
