        "text": "RKO Pictures' romantic comedy ''Milk and Money'' is very much a family affair. The film, which had its premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival in East Hampton, is produced by Ted Hartley, RKO's chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife, Dina Merrill, vice chairman. Ms. Merrill also plays in the film as Ellen, the mother, and Mr. Hartley gives a cameo appearance as a wacky lingerie salesman.\n\n''Normally I don't appear in the pictures,'' Mr. Hartley said in a recent interview, ''but we just happened to be shooting near our home in Long Island and like the famous mystery director Alfred Hitchcock, just occasionally I'll do a cameo. But I don't normally wear lingerie.''\n\n''Milk and Money,'' the first theatrical release from RKO's new small pictures label, Radio Active Films, created for promising new talent, is a modern-day fable about falling in love in New York City and dealing with where to put 21 cows. It is the first feature by Michael Bergmann, who wrote and directed.\n\n''Michael Bergmann actually came to me as an actor to work in the film,'' Ms. Merrill said, ''and that's how we happened to read the script and fell in love with it.''\n\nWriting and directing the film was only the beginning for the New York-born Mr. Bergmann, 42, who spent much of the time at the Hamptons festival promoting the film, with RKO's encouragement. Mr. Hartley, who has been with RKO for six years, said what intrigued him about the story of ''Milk and Money'' was the fantasy and magic of relationships in New York.\n\n''It's about young people living in the fantasy that New York is,'' he said, ''finding their way to each other. The wonderful thing about the movie is it is a fantasy, so that things happen which really normally only happen in your imagination or perhaps you could imagine them happening to you in New York.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
