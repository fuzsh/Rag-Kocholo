        "text": "NEW YORK — Dina Merrill, the rebellious heiress who defied her super-rich parents to become a movie star, often portraying stylish wives or \"the other woman,\" has died at age 93.\n\nMerrill, raised in part on the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida now owned by President Donald Trump, died Monday, according to a family spokeswoman. The cause of death and other details were not immediately available Tuesday.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, Merrill appeared in more than 100 films and television programs, her break coming after Katharine Hepburn recommended her for the 1957 Tracy-Hepburn comedy \"The Desk Set.\" Merrill, who had the poised, aristocratic beauty of fellow blonde Grace Kelly, co-starred with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis in \"Operation Petticoat,\" Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in \"The Sundowners\" and Oscar winner Elizabeth Taylor in \"Butterfield 8.\" More recently, she was part of Robert Altman's ensemble cast for the Hollywood satire \"The Player\" and in television programs such as \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"The Nanny.\"\n\nBut becoming an actress was not considered proper for someone of Merrill's privileged status. Her mother was Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress to the Post cereal fortune and one of the nation's richest women. Her father was E.F. Hutton, founder of the stockbroker firm that bore his name. Heiress Barbara Hutton was a cousin.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in 1945 with \"The Mermaids Singing\" and followed with \"George Washington Slept Here\" and off-Broadway plays. She quit acting in 1946, partly because of her mother's pressure. \"My mother brainwashed me,\" she said. \"I turned down my career to marry my Marine.\"\n\nHe was Stanley Rumbough Jr., heir to a Colgate fortune who had been serving as a White House aide. After his Marine Corps' service he became head of the Metal Containers Corp. and a company that made pari-mutuel betting machines. The couple had three children — Stanley, David and Nina. After the birth of her daughter, Merrill resumed her acting and modeling career and was invited to Hollywood by Dick Powell for appearances in his television series.\n\nMerrill and Rumbough divorced in 1966, the same year she married actor Cliff Robertson. As a result, her name was dropped from the snobbish Social Register, which excluded actors.\n\nShe was born Nedenia Hutton in New York City, and was drawn to the acting life at age 8, when she played an Indian in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta at Greenvale School. She grew up in lavish surroundings, particularly Mar-a-Lago, her parents' 118-room Mediterranean-Moorish estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nWhen Hutton began her acting career, she chose to call herself Dina Merrill, a combination of her and a brother-in-law's names.\n\n- The late Associated Press writer Bob Thomas contributed to this report."
