        "text": "So many really big deals have been happening of late. Who says that the Hamptons market has cooled? Not us. That’s for sure. But first, before we dive into the notable closers, a little price reduction is in order to start us off.\n\nICONIC PRICE CHOP\n\nWhat began at $30,000,000 was reduced to $23,000,000 and was recently reduced again to $19,995,000! Priced to sell is an understatement. This spectacular timeless estate is a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire an iconic property in an iconic location. It seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor living with all facing views. 35 Morrison Lane has it all — a lofted guest house, tennis court, waterside pool and a 50 foot dock on Mecox Bay. There is a rare combination of mid-century modern architecture, design, and craftsmanship. This estate is inspired by Gwathmey, designed by the renown Tod Williams, and pays attention to detail like no other. Doreen Atkins of Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.\n\n‘OPERATION’ DINA’S ‘DESK SET’\n\nThe daughter of Dina Merrill has officially acquired yet another property in East Hampton. 108 Egypt Lane, which had been offered for rent for as much as $55,000 a month in the past but had not been offered for sale, was presumably previously held by her famous mother. The circa-1920, 2,000-square-foot estate was purchased by Nedenia Colgate Rumbough for $4.9 million from Lane East Holding LLC. The fairly modest three-bedroom, four-bath shingle-style supplements those she already owns in the village, which include 55 Egypt Close and 8 West Dune Lane, purchased from Ms. Merrill’s estate. The actress and philanthropist, whose birth name was Nedenia Marjorie Hutton, passed in 2017 at the age of 93. She was the only child of Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and famous Wall Street stockbroker E.F. Hutton. She appeared in the films “Butterfield 8,” “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father,” “Desk Set,” “Operation Petticoat,” and numerous television shows. Married to former film producer and RKO Pictures Chairman Ted Hartley for nearly 30 years preceding her death, Ms. Merrill had previously been married to Colgate-Palmolive heir, and Ms. Rumbough’s father, Stanley Rumbough for approximately two decades and to actor Cliff Robertson for 20 years.\n\nHOT FOR NATURAL GAS\n\nIn another off-market deal, natural gas billionaire Michael S. Smith and his wife, Iris, sold their Bridgehampton home at 263 Surfside to the tune of $42.5 million. The seven-bedroom house, designed by Barnes Coy Architects, is sited on 1.42 acres and comes with its own private walkway to the beach, a pool, pool house and an outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven and bar, plus panoramic views of Sagg Pond and the Atlantic Ocean. No word yet on who the buyer was but their brokers were Ryan Serhant of Nest Seekers and Eileen O’Neill of Douglas Elliman.\n\nNO FAIRYTALE ENDING\n\nAnother property that recently changed hands is 86 Georgica Road in East Hampton, which had been owned by the late novelist Barbara Goldsmith, the writer of “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” who died in 2016. Offered in 2013 for more than $10 million, the property — which included a 5,000-square-foot traditional built in 1907 and with elegant interiors by Mica Ertegun, landscape by James Van Sweden, guest cottage, pool and pool house on 1.1 acres — ended up changing hands for about half that price.\n\nGROSVENOR GOES\n\nAnd yet another prime parcel that recently closed is 199 Coopers Neck Lane in Southampton. Designed by Grosvenor Atterbury in 1910, the historic estate sold for $11.6 million. Represented by Tim Davis and Thomas Davis of Corcoran, the 3-acre property features a 14,000 brick home with 11 bedrooms and 12 baths and wood-shingled roof, plus pool, pool house, sunken tennis court and mature plantings.\n\nCPF CLOSES A DEAL\n\nThe valuable land at 81 Ocean Avenue in East Hampton is now the property of East Hampton Town. The house that sat on it until last month, not so much, as it’s been torn done already. The 1-acre property, which borders Hook Pond in the village and comes with 107 feet of frontage as well as views of the dunes and Maidstone golf course, had been on the market since 2014. Represented by the Atlantic Team’s Justin Agnello, James Keogh and Hara Kang of Douglas Elliman, it sold for $4.995 million to the Community Preservation Fund.\n\nCH-CH-CHANGES\n\nWhile Ani Antreasyan has spent most of her time designing apartments, homes and gardens, she is now looking forward to finding the right homes for her clients as she joins the Halstead team. She says that she has been training all her life for her new career in Real Estate in the Hamptons. Ani, owner of Ani Ancient Stone, the New York based antiques and design firm she founded in 1998, is recognized as the creator of idyllic gardens and karmic interiors. Ani works and lives in East Hampton, New York."
