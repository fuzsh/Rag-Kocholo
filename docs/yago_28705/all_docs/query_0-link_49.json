        "text": "ShareBar\n\nAbove: photo by Beth Perkins\n\n“There’s an artistic spark in everybody,” says Ted Hartley (MMP 4, 1956). “If you can get rid of that left-brain inner critic, you can explore what will open up in the right-brain side in all of us.” Hartley came to painting a little over a decade ago, when he brought an instructor to his home for a Sunday-morning art class. He had organized the gathering to engage his wife, the actress Dina Merrill, as she began showing signs of dementia: “I was afraid of losing contact with her, that I would miss the fading signals. It feels as though you’re walking on the edge of a cliff. I asked myself, What can I do to keep my wife interested and alive? With that objective in mind, I started the watercolor class and invited eight of her friends to join.”\n\nWhen Merrill died in 2017, Hartley struggled to find a new focus. The couple had been together for nearly 30 years. “After the mourning and confusion, you need to reinvent yourself, find out how you think and who you’re going to be, alone.” He continued the classes, bringing in a new instructor and rebuilding his own interest in painting with watercolor and acrylics. He walled in a breezeway in his home to create a studio with skylights. “I continued to draw and paint but now I had a place to do it—and that changed everything,” Hartley recalls. An art gallery in Sag Harbor, New York, held a one-man show of Hartley’s work in 2019 and 2021, followed by another in November 2022 that included three paintings inspired by the war in Ukraine. Proceeds from the sale of those works totaled just under $150,000 and benefited Ukrainian aid organizations.\n\nA similar sense of kismet runs through the other branches of Hartley’s remarkable career: US Navy carrier fighter pilot, investment banker, actor, and film producer. His acting career began with the role of Reverend Jerry Bedford in the 1960s television series Peyton Place. He says playing a sniveling coward opposite Clint Eastwood in 1973’s High Plains Drifter was a career opener. Many other roles followed, as did his work as a film producer, director, and CEO of the revived RKO Pictures. In that sense, Hartley already had extensive experience with creative expression when he came to his next career move.\n\nOf his painting process, Hartley says, “I start with the colors, which leads to a more powerful, intuitive paint-on-canvas movement. If I use my analytical brain to figure out how something should go, it’s usually wrong.” That effortless, spontaneous, go-with-the-flow approach has taken Hartley in some completely new directions over the decades: “However you start is not how you’re going to end up,” he explains. “If I consider how I began painting and where I am now, I realize I have not figured it out in advance. One way I think about it is that I’m on an unmarked trail—and there will surely be some deluges of rain and other catastrophes—but the trail goes on, and if I follow it, so do I.”\n\nHow to: Go in a Completely New Direction\n\nFind your river, flow, and jump in.\n\n“Look for a strong interest that fits who you are, that you can be good at, so you can come out into a more wide-open area to play in your imagination. Then, go for it.”\n\nRemember there’s room at the top in anything you do.\n\n“Whatever your thing is, notice who else is trying to do it and their approach. Try that and do it a bit better. Trust your instinct to beat back doubts and discouragement and get on the path again.”\n\nStay focused.\n\n“There’ll be times when you lose the way, but don’t let that distract you. Just stay open and move ahead—and when you do find the trail again, relax. Follow it trustingly with the right side of your brain, not the smart side.”\n\nShareBar"
