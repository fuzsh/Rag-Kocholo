        "text": "De Carteret, Le Quesne & De Jersey connections\n\nAnother Interesting Connection – following on from Colin Le Messurier’s article in May 1998\n\nDear De Carteret descendants,\n\nI am writing to you in the Spring of 2004 from the Island of Tasmania, Australia where my great great great Grandfather Charles De Jersey, was born in St Peter Port, Guernsey, Channel Islands, UK. In the 1850’s he came with his new wife Charlotte Golding and some children after visiting and living in New Zealand for a time, to the capital city of Hobart, Tasmania. And thus established a large clan in Tasmania.\n\nCharles was a carpenter and emigrated as a free person as was the case for a great percentage of Australian descendants.\n\nThis is contrary to the popular myth propounded by media that most Australians are descendants of convicts – this latter assertion, in my case, is far from the truth as none of my direct ancestors were convicts.\n\nI have enjoyed exploring the website and being able to connect my Great Great Great Great Grandfather Peter De Jersey to the De Carteret line.\n\nThank you to the person/s who have so generously created the Data Base and made it available and so easy to manipulate and navigate.\n\nPeter De Jersey was the son of Henry De Jersey ( who hosted John Wesley & Adams at his home in St Peter Port Guernsey and was the driving force for Methodism in the Islands) who married Susanne Le Quesne (27/05/1739-21/05/1818).\n\nMy Great Great Great Great Great Grandmother Susanne (Le Quesne) De Jersey was the daughter of John Le Quesne and Susan Le Maistre. John’s Grandfather\n\nJohn Le Quesne (3/05/1627) married Elizabeth De Carteret. Elizabeth was the daughter of\n\nWilliam De Carteret (1599 – 1664) and Sarah Sarre.\n\nThe line continues up to Guillaume De Carteret (980 – 1004), my 36th Great grandfather!\n\nThe interesting thing when I was reading the article by Colin Le Messurier was his connection to the late Princess of Wales via Sir Phillip De Carteret and Lady Georgina Carteret. This pair is my nineteenth great-grandparents, so I too would be connected to the Spencers and the young princes. So they do have another connection whether they like or not Downunder! What a surprise to discover.\n\nI thought you might like to share with other De Carteret members this connection.\n\nRegards,\n\nKim O’Brien (Mr.)\n\nLe Cercle De Carteret Jersey Reunion 2017.\n\nFriday 12th of May\n\nJohn George De Carteret met all the group attending our Le Cercle De Carteret weekend at the Societe Jersaise Head Quarters, in Pier Street.\n\nJohn presented his line of De Carteret family research. We were shown documents and family photos. He explained that during the time spent gathering all documentation for the project, he discovered through looking at his Grandfathers details, he had Uncles and Aunts, also cousins he had previously not known about.\n\nOur family group also shared their interest in recognising their links to the De Carteret name.\n\nSaturday 13th of May,\n\nBecause John George is a member and volunteer of both Societe Jersaise and The Jersey Archives, he organised a special visit for our group on a Saturday morning to the Jersey Archives, St Helier.\n\nWe were very grateful for the volunteer staff who came to give the tour, we were shown how they take great care storing the bequeathed documents. Trudi our guide had prepared a display of some De Carteret documents she knew would be of interest to us. One very old deeds of sale, a document was particular interest as it was pertaining to a claim for reimbursement of goods lost while under Nazi Occupation. These and other documents are available to view. For anyone who wishes to use this research tool Jersey Archive membership is essential.\n\nSaturday evening some of the group joined a walking tour of St Helier. This was headed by Ned Malet de Carteret a Blue Badge accredited guide.\n\nNed seen here is explaining the Town church monument dedicated by the De Carteret Family.\n\nnedmalet1@gmail.com\n\nAn evening at The Quayside Restaurant, St Helier, organized by Denise De Carteret where we had a very good evening meal.\n\nMartyn Sayer the owner of the restaurant is very interested in the “De Carteret” family history, he has written an article about Sir George Carteret, which he presented to Le Cercle De Carteret. The article describes how Sir George Carteret and his family helped King Charles the Second while fleeing to Jersey during the English civil war. The King honoured The De Carteret’s and Jersey’s loyalty in 1645. The history can be found on Wikipedia or Books written about George Carteret’s life and times.\n\nwww.libertysjersey.co.uk/quayside-bistro\n\nSunday 14th May\n\nTantivy Bus Company organised by John George De Carteret, collected all our group from the various hotels in St Helier.\n\nOur first stop was La Hougue Bie Prehistoric Burial Chamber that is under a large hill mound which has a medieval chapel on top of the mound.\n\nThere is a German bunker also in the area of Jersey Heritage site.\n\nOn special display in the premises at the side of the Burial Chamber is the spectacular Jersey Hoard which was found in a field, the huge soil and clay bound hoard has coins and gold jewellery still to be uncovered. It now has a permanent home at the museum. A display of various Geology and other information about Jersey’s natural history is also on display including artefacts discovered by archaeologists through the ages.\n\nClose by are stones from the various Prehistoric tombs with descriptions of where the stones were originally placed in Jersey countryside.\n\nLunch was held at “The Sir George Carteret” for 20 people. Although the sign outside the premises advises that they do not accommodate large coach parties, we had secured a booking for our gathering and having the name De Carteret being relatives were welcomed and had a lovely English Sunday lunch.\n\nOur “Tantivy” coach had been hired for most of the day. We drove through the lovely Jersey countryside and on to St Ouen’s Manor.\n\nWe were welcomed by Charles and Georgina Malet de Carteret, and Charles brother Ned Malet de Carteret.\n\nCharles and Georgina opened their home to our group, Charles gave the group all the detailed history about the construction of the Manor and also pointed out the Family portraits of people who previously lived in the Manor throughout its history.\n\nOn our tour of the gardens Charles described how his forebears had constructed the garden which is there today, we were shown a memorial to Monsieur Francis Scornet. A Frenchman who with other men sailed into St Peter Port, Guernsey, June 1942. They were escaping from France and mistakenly took Guernsey for the South of England. Little did they realise that the Channel Islands was occupied by the Nazis. Unfortunately Francis Scornet was suspected as being the ring leader and taken to Jersey, he was executed at St Ouen’s Manor as a warning to the population. Every year a memorial service is held in the gardens and attended by French delegates.\n\nAt 5.30 we were collected by an open topped vintage bus, Denise De Carteret organised and arranged the tour in memory of John Philip De Carteret one of our founder members, who passed away in 2015. We had very scenic hour long tour. With special permission to drive through the grounds of Trinity Manor. Which at one time was also the home of the De Carteret’s in Jersey."
