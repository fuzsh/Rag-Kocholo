        "text": "Second-year head coach Kevin Freeman knows the learning curve for his youthful Ramblers is still ongoing as their season opener against J.F. Kennedy-Iselin is Aug. 26 in a Week 0 match-up of two teams looking to set the tone for the 2022 season.\n\nHis biggest worry is the graduation of just about the entire offensive and defensive lines which featured All-Area defensive tackle Jehu Andrews, a dominant two-way performer last season. However, he is happy with what he has seen thus far from his team.\n\n“I like how these younger guys who were sophomores last year are coming together,” Freeman said. “They are willing to put in the extra work to get better.”\n\nWith that being said, the Ramblers’ mentor thought it was a good idea to change their offensive scheme which best suits the athleticism of this large junior class.\n\nOn opening night, the Carteret faithful will see the unveiling of a spread offense that will utilize the speed and athleticism that is in abundance in the sophomore and junior classes.\n\nJuniors Tyrece Parrott and Michael Gomm are both competing at quarterback with the decision as to who gets the nod against Kennedy on opening night to be decided in the final days of the preseason preparation.\n\nJakir Thomas (So.) who saw significant playing time in the second half of last season will start as the feature back in the multiple spread offense. Thomas has legitimate track speed and was a prolific long and triple jumper this past spring. Jordan Muniz (Jr.) will be the backup at feature back or as a slot back.\n\nThe slot backs, which act as receivers and running backs, will incorporate three juniors Jahad Thompson, Jeremiah Serrano and Asi Powell – all skilled in running the jet sweep, swing pass, toss or taking the pitch from the quarterback in the zone read.\n\nWhen Carteret looks to take a deep shot down the field, Sir Hezekiah Ragland (Jr.) can go up high for the pass using his 6-foot-3, 195-pound athletic frame to snatch the ball away from would-be-defenders.\n\nFellow classmate Yariel Castellanos will align opposite Ragland along with sophomore Eric Thompson, also in the mix at receiver.\n\nSenior Rasheim Price-Jones will handle the shotgun snap and will be backed up at center by sophomore Yari Miranda, who transferred in from New York.\n\nFrancis Boakye (Sr.), Hasaan Khan (Jr.) and Jacob Bess (So.) will align on either side of Price-Jones, while Cameron Browne (Jr.) mans the left offensive tackle with Jack Wlodarczyk at right tackle and Khris Armstrong as the backup.\n\nJamil Jackson, the former Elizabeth High School head coach, is now Carteret’s new defensive coordinator. Opposing offenses can expect an aggressive attacking 3-4 defensive that will utilize the speed and athleticism of the Ramblers.\n\nWlodarczyk, Browne and Boakye will play the defensive tackles who can align in various shades on the offense linemen based on the defensive call. Bess will join Antwaun Jackson (Jr.) and Napoleon Williams (Sr.) as defensive ends.\n\nThe linebacker corps is led by Ragland on the inside, while Castellanos and Price-Jones will align on either side of the man in the middle who will remind the opposition that his full name is Sir Hezekiah Ragand when they meet each other at the line of scrimmage. Marckel Aiken will also be in the linebacker rotation.\n\nThomas and Jahad Thompson will man the lock down corner positions, while Parrott and Eric Thompson cover center field or fill the alley on run plays from their safety positions in the defensive secondary. Muniz and Serrano are capable backups and will give Carteret added depth on the defense.\n\nNapoleon Williams will handle the punting and place-kicking duties for the Ramblers. Thomas and Jahad Thompson will be threats to take it to the house should the opposition kick the ball to either of these speedy return specialists.\n\n“Many of these juniors were on the field toward the end of the year last season and have a lot of experience,” the Ramblers head coach said. “We have a bevy of skill players who can make plays.”\n\nOne thing is for sure, after winning two of their last four games a year ago, the Class of 2024 wants everyone to know they are ready to take that next step in bringing Carteret football back to its winning ways.\n\nCARTERET RAMBLERS\n\nCoach: Kevin Freeman, second season\n\nAssistants: Nick Hrycuna (special teams and passing coordinator); Jamil Jackson (defensive coordinator); Dan Morvay (quarterbacks); Lewis Peccarelli (running backs, outside backers); Rob Lorenzo (offensive line); Billy Merz (defensive backs); Ken Freeman (offensive and defensive lines); Clark Coe (safeties), Charles Faulkner (running backs, head freshman).\n\nState classification: South Group 3\n\nLeague: Big Central United Silver\n\nColors: Blue and white\n\nOffensive formation: Multiple Spread\n\nDefensive formation: 3-4\n\n2022 SCHEDULE\n\nAug. 26 J.F.
