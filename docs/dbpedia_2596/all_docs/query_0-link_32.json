        "text": "on 17 Jul 2006 •\n\nI wonder if Sir W.W. *really* learned something from our Sam or if he was dissembling as being the polite thing to do with the man who controls the contracts? I picture him nodding and smiling and saying really, he didn't know that! My, my, that really is very clever Mr Pepys.\n\n\"they neither do understand to this day Creed's accounts\" . Reminds me of Dilbert's pointy-haired boss - sailing along with power and influence but not understanding how it all works at all really.\n\n\"stand still and do nothing\"\n\nThey would be better not meddling in Naval matters at all and it would be worth their having larger salaries, just to get them out of the way!\n\nI am sure I am not the only one annotating who has longed for an incompetant manager to get promotion so they are more out of harm's way and away from the real work.\n\non 18 Jul 2006 •\n\nNot all men have equal talent when it comes to understanding the mating game.\n\nSam be a pioneer in the game of superior organising, he is in the process of setting standards for game of commerce. The English, up to 1946 played the game of gents and players, whereby the gents [lauded ones ] never discuss LSD in front of the ladies, merchants, and labourers and their ilke. They took the the kudos for the the bottom line.\n\nIt was a great system, separation of pomp from circumstance. A good exec. knows what, who, when where and how to delegate the real work, but then there be some poor judgement that uncovers the curtain of ignorance.\n\nStalin found it was ok to delete Generals but to feed his sergeants to the siberean sharks nearly unseated him, like it does the future James, and G. III.\n\non 18 Jul 2006 •\n\nI'll go with Sam's opinion on Minnes but I think he's seriously underestimating Carteret.\n\n***\n\nI think our ambitious young Bagwell spotted Pepys' roving eye some time ago...\n\nWhether his missus is the virtuous modest woman Sam sees or a behind-the-scenes scheming Judy Barton (the film Vertigo) as I noted a few days ago time will tell...\n\nInteresting to consider what our boy would do should his patron Sandwich declare serious interest in Bess.\n\nWould he go the Poldy Bloom road of quiet acceptance for the sake of peace and finances...With a vague consideration of future hush money? (\"I would never wish my Lady Jemina to suffer embarassment, my Lord.\")\n\nDefy cousin Ed in his teeth and risk all? (\"Creed? Howe? What is this...Cement?\" \"Ah, Pepys...I regret to tell you, my Lord was most displeased by your attitude. Was he not, Howe?\" \"Most displeased, Mr. Creed.\")\n\nFind a middle ground, retiring with Bess quietly to the country? (\"Let us away forever from this wicked Sodom of London, Bess.\" \"Leave London? For Brampton? Forever?\")\n\n(Take my wife, please...My Lord.)\n\non 18 Jul 2006 •\n\nMy note on Bess and Sandwich here is speculation of what Sam would do if faced with a situation where Sandwich was showing the same interest in Bess that he's increasingly showing in Mrs. Bagwell. Other notes have likewise been speculation as to how Bess or Sam would deal with a situation that was all too common at this time...So common Sam is showing signs of trying it himself on his own smaller scale.\n\nA few entries back, Sam recorded that Sandwich suddenly noted to several people in his presence that Pepys had married a great beauty. When a nobleman of this court who's shown a tendency to follow the court's tastes goes out of his way to say something like that it's reasonable to suppose that there is some interest that way and to wonder what might be happening behind the scenes when Bess is living away from Sam and near Sandwich's estate and likely a frequent visitor owing to her friendship with Lady Jem. Sandwich no doubt feels Sam and Bess owe him all their success and a powerful fellow like him feels entitled to ask a lot at this period in history. The real point though is to wonder how our Sam would deal, given what we know of his character and attitudes.\n\nAs for the future, I leave it to itself...\n\non 18 Jul 2006 •\n\n\"I think he’s seriously underestimating Carteret.\"\n\nA little off topic,and a few \"little general spoilers perhaps\"~~ I just started reading Carteret's biography, but am not far enough along to get a full picture of him. What is clear is that he did NOT like school,or his early teacher (Pipon), but loved the sea. Balleine in \"All for the King\", says \"George hated the school. He hated Pierre Pipon, the Regent. The syntax problems of the ancient Romans roused in him no spark of curiosity. In later life his ignorance of the classics shocked some of his colleagues. Once, when he saw hangings in the Duke of York's chamber depicting a scene in Rome, he asked Pepys what the S.P.Q.R. on the standards stood for, \"ignorance\", scoffed the Diarist, \"not to be borne in a Privy Councillor; methinks a schoolboy would be whipped for not knowing\". Yet George's schooltime was not wasted. Scores of his letters survive, which show that he could express himself in good grammatical English, remarkably good when one remembers that French was his native tongue. His spelling was better than that of many of the other courtiers, and the detailed Reports that he wrote of his two expeditions are admirably lucid and graphic. Moreover the intricate financial transactions that he had to control later, first as Treasurer of the Navy, and then as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland show that he must have been no mean arithmetician. Pierre Pipon had not wielded the birch in vain.\" (p. 5)\n\nGeorge also left school at an early age to go to sea (around age 13 or younger). Lady Fanshaw (who knew him well) says in her Memoirs that he was \"bred as a sea-boy\". (p. 5)\n\nAnother interesting point is that \"no scandal marred his record\", so the libertine court of Charles II and the loose morals of the time did not seem to be a pull to him as there are no mentions of mistresses and his love letters to his wife during their courtship have a nice sincerity to them.\n\nFinally, in a general context, Balleine says\" Carteret was no dashing hero of romance like Montrose or Rupert, though, as many of his exploits show, as a fighting man he was utterly fearless: but we see him mainly as a sober, hard-working servant of the King whose Royalism was his religion. A simple, undeviating, almost doglike devotion to the Crown was the mainspring of all of his actions. He had his faults, including one bad one [which isn't mentioned here],which we have tried not to disguise;but he remains an outstanding example of the Cavalier ideal of utter and unswerving loyalty, an ideal which his family enshrined in their motto 'Loyal devoir'\". (p 2)\n\non 15 Jul 2007 •\n\nNo free press in the religiously \"tolerant\" Netherlands\n\nSpinoza to Oldenburg, July 17/27, 1663\n\nDistinguished Sir,\n\nI have at length received your long wished for letter, and am at liberty to answer it. But, before I do so, I will briefly tell you, what has prevented my replying before.\n\n....While [in Amsterdam] certain friends asked me to impart to them a treatise containing, in brief, the second part of the principles of Descartes treated geometrically....[,] to compose a similar treatise on the first part...[and] for leave to print it, which I readily granted on the condition that one of them should, under my supervision,...add a little preface warning readers that I do not acknowledge all the opinions there set forth as my own....\n\n....It may be that on this occasion some of those, who hold the foremost positions in my country, will be found desirous of seeing the rest of my writings, which I acknowledge as my own; they will thus take care that I am enabled to publish them without any danger of infringing the laws of the land. If this be as I think, I shall doubtless publish at once; if things fall out otherwise, I would rather be silent than obtrude my opinions on men, in defiance of my country, and thus render them hostile to me.... http://bdsweb.tripod.com/en/lette…\n\nSpinoza's magnum opus, his *Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata* (Ethics) was published after his death in 1677."
