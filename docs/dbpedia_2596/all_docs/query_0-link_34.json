We are informed by a Correspondent, that had the wind shifted suddenly to southward, and blown equally hard (as sometimes happens) a great portion of this fine fleet of vessels would, in all probability, be stranded, whereas with the proposed Breakwater they may at all times ride within it in perfect safety, in any wind.\n\nMarriage\n\nPortrait of Emily, Wife of Carteret John William Ellis, by John HOLLINS (1798-1855)\n\nHe married Emily Railton on the 6th July 1831, in the Parish Church of St George Hanover Square, Middlesex.

Mrs. Kempson - Newspaper notes her on the second will. Sir John Nicoll giving judgement.[50]\n\nCourt of King's Bench [51][52]\n\nMr Erskine moved on behalf of Messrs, Scobell, Tremainer, and Painter, Magistrates of the County of Cornwall, for a rule to show cause why a criminal information should not be filed against Carteret Ellis, John Ellis, and Frederick Goddard, residing in the vicinity of Penzance. Carteret Ellis against whom he moved as the principal party in the transaction of which he complained, was the son of John Ellis, who had practised as an attorney, and , in the year 1823 had come to reside on certain lands the vicinity of Penzance, to which it was supposed he had a derived a right under a will. Mr John Ellis was without hesitation received by the Magistrates and gentlemen of the county into their society, as one upon whose character there was no imputation. But in 1824 rumours were circulating about a proceeding in the Ecclesiatical Court, respecting the very will under which John Ellis was supposed to hold the lands on which he resided, and in that year a report appeared in the newspapers, of a judgement pronounced by Sir John Nicholl, in a suit respecting this will, in which his sisters of Mr John Ellis, and another, were plaintiffs, and Mr John Ellis was defendant, and in that judgement Sir John Nicholl was represented as animadverting in severe terms on the conduct of the defendant, Mr John Ellis, in reference to the execution of the will, and as having ordered to pay the costs of the suit. Mr. Scobell, one of the Magistrates on whose behalf he now moved, had an interview with John Ellis on the subject of these rumours, and Mr Ellis asserted that the imputations against his character were grossly false, and that it was his full intention to appeal against Sir John Nicholl, and the gentlemen still continued on friendly terms. A considerable time elapsed, and it did not appear that John taken any proceedings for the prosecution of the appeal, and the gentlemen began to withdraw their confidence from Mr. Ellis. Matters were in this situation when, in the year, 1826 John Ellis presented himself in order to get himself qualified as a Magistrate. The Magistrates directly declined qualifying him at that time, and adjourned the sitting to a future date, but before the day arrived they sent word to Mr. John Ellis, that, as long as the rumours against his character remained unexplained, that they must decline admitting him to qualify, and that they hoped that, in order to prevent the matter being made more public, John Ellis would refrain from presenting himself. Mr Ellis, however, chose to preserve, and that they had written to the Lord Lieutenant on the subject, and that, if it should be his Lordship's determination that he should be admitted aa a Magistrate, they could not prevent his qualifying.\n\nIn 1827, no proceedings were taken by Mr. Ellis to the delegates, although one of the Judges of Appeal had taken notice of the circumstance and animadverted upon it.\n\nIn 1828, Mr F Goddard presented a letter from Carteret Ellis, to Mr. Scobell, Mr Tremaineer who both refused to look at it, so he delivered it to Mr Painter, when it was found to contain a demand for an explanation, or for the satisfaction due to a gentleman. Mr Painter in reply to this , stated that, as Magistrates, acting on public grounds, they did not think themselves called upon to give either the explanation or the satisfaction required. Then on on 27th July 1828 Mr Scobell received Carteret's letter enclosed in Mr F Goddard letter, in which he intimated that now all communications must be made through him (Goddard). In the letter of Mr. C Ellis, the Magistrate was described as so mean, shuffling, paltry, base, and cowardly, that they had forfeited all claims to the society of gentlemen.\n\nMagistrates thought it was there duty to bring these parties to court; and they now stated in their affidavitis that they had no share in raising or propagating the rumours against the character of Mr John Ellis, and they disclaimed all personal motives, and averred that they acted entirely on public grounds, and had no ill-will to Mr Ellis.\n\nPortrait\n\nCarteret John William Ellis (1805–1858), JP, Deputy Lieutenant for Cornwall, MA Portrait [53]\n\nHistory of Parliament Online (http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/search/node/carteret%20John%20William%20ellis) ELLIS I, John (1812-?), of 50 Hereford Street, Grosvenor Square, London ... b . 21 Nov. 1812, 5 th s. of John Ellis, of Sennen, Cornw.

Read Preface, to understand. Tries to correct with later Versions of the book, not all successfully. Here is a Searchable Copy I have included it because it gave me an idea of what to search. He found out about Carteret's Anna Scobell but not her father."
