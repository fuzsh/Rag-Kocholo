It was noted in 1771 that Dagnams had a central block of two storeys with attics, containing eleven bays which may have been the original house of c1660. Carteret's extensions meant that this central block was flanked at each end by five-bay wings, also of two storeys, but without attics - creating a very large, 21-bay house, but shallow at only four bays deep. â¨\n\nEdward appeared at the Old Bailey Court.22 nd May 1735 Ref : t17350522-3\n\nCrown v Peel , Forgery\n\n(see www.oldbaileyonline.org.)Charles Peel 22 may 1735\n\n3.

Owned 1749-72 by Henry Muilman\n\nSt Clement Danes Essex & Dagenham Park in 1772, covered 680 acres, consisting of capital messuage (Dagnams) and land of 200 acres,\n\nSir Henry, Wright who died under age, was succeeded by his sister Ann,Auant of Jeminah, daughter of Lord Sandwich, married to Phillip the son of Sir George Carteret, treasurer to the Navy. Lady Jeminah was niece to Lady Anne Wright and sister-in-law to Lord Sandwich, who was Vice-Admiral of the fleet and to whom Pepys was secretary. Pepys, an inveterate snob, was only too happy to act as intermediary, because of the great honour of being invited to stay at Dagnams and the possible influence the two great aristocratic families could bring to bear on his future career at the Admiralty, if the marriage settlement was successfully negotiated. During the negotiations, Pepys visited Dagnams several times, and his visits were recorded in his diary:\n\n\"July 15th [1665]. Mr. Carteret and I to the ferry-place at Greenwich, and there staid an hour, crossing the water to and again to get our coach and horses over; and by and by set out, and so toward Dagenhams. But Lâd! what silly discourse we had as to love matters, he being the most awkward man ever I met with in my life as to that business. Thither we come, and by that time it began to be dark, and were kindly received by Lady Wright and my Lord Creweâ¦\" Anne, his sister, now a great heiress. In 1689, she married Edmund Pye, of Farringdon, Berkshire, and later William Rider; and by these two husbands had a large family. During the first two decades of the eighteenth century, the estate was heavily mortgaged; Anne entered into bonds with Edward Carteret [1711], and the Earl of Dysart [1720], and others.\n\nAnn who married Edmund Pye and later William Rider. By her will, proved 1732, she devised all her Essex estates to her relative Edward Carteret (d. 1739). (fn. 69) She expressed the wish that Carteret would never part with the estate, and would keep it in his family, but in 1749 his daughters and coheirs Ann, widow of Admiral Philip Cavendish, and Bridget Carteret sold it to Henry Muilman. (fn. 70) Anne Rider (nee Wright) in her will dated 1726, left Dagnams to her cousin Edward Carteret instead of her husband, William Rider, or her children. Dagnams was conveyed to Carteret by deed of title at the time of the will. The proviso to the bequest stated that he was to redeem all mortgages and other debts outstanding on the estate after her death. The reason for the bequest is not known, but possibly the estate was so heavily encumbered that it had to pass to a member of the family - Edward Carteret - who could afford to pay all debts outstanding. Alternatively, Carteret may have held mortgages on Dagnams - deed of mortgage between Anne Rider and Edward Carteret, 1711, so that the bequest of the estate to him in 1726 may have been one way of redeeming the bond.\n\nEdward Carteret, related to the family by the marriage of Lady Jeminah and Phillip Carteret in 1665, was Postmaster General during the reign of George II, and came into full possession of the estate after the death of Anne Rider in 1731. He married Lady Bridget, Sir John Sudbury's widow, by whom he had several children, Carteret died in 1739, Dagnams passing to his two remaining children, Bridget, Maid of Honour to the Queen Caroline, and Anne-Isabella, the wife of Admiral Cavendish.\n\nNotes for Bridget (Spouse 1)"
