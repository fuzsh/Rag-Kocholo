        "text": "Woodbridge\n\nOn March 12, 1664, King Charles II granted the land now known as New Jersey to his brother, James, the Duke of York. On June 24, 1664, James gave the territory called East Jersey to Sir George Carteret, governor of the Channel Island of Jersey. The territory became English on September 7, 1664 when the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam. Carteret authorized a plan called \"Concessions and Agreements,\" intended to open Jersey to Puritan land speculators from New England and Long Island. Later in September 1664, Puritan Associates purchased the territory known as the Elizabethtown Purchase, and the deed was confirmed on December 1, 1664. On December 11, 1666, New England associates agreed to purchase the southern section of this purchase which extended from the Rahway River to the Raritan River and west including all of the present day townships of Woodbridge and Piscataway and the City of Perth Amboy. In December 1667, a confirmatory deed for accommodating the town of Woodbridge was issued. Woodbridge Township was chartered on June 1, 1669.\n\nThere are conflicting stories as to the origins of the name \"Woodbridge\" for the settlement. One theory holds it was named in honor of Rev. John Woodbridge (right; 1613-1696), one of the original European colonists of Massachusetts. Another theory claims settlers chose the name after a market town in Suffolk, England, where some had originally been from. One story claims Rev. Woodbridge arrived with five men - John Pike, Hopewell Hull, John Martin, Charles Gilman, and John Gilman - who built five wood cabins and an octagonal-shaped meeting house and church on what they called Kirk Green, \"kirk\" being a Scots word for a church. It is presumed Woodbridge returned to New England. This was on the land now occupied by the First Presbyterian Church of Woodbridge Township.\n\n1669 Towne Charter\n\nLord Carteret (right, c.1610-1680) shared interest in New Jersey with Lord John Berkeley (left, 1602-1678). In December 1667, a confirmatory deed for the accommodating of the town now called Woodbridge was issued. It was signed by Daniel Pierce, John Pike and Abraham Tappen and associates, Pierceâs son Joshua, Obadiah Ayers, Thomas Bloomfield, Elisha Parker, Richard Worth, John Whitaker, Robert Van Quellen, John Bishop, Henry Jacques, and Hugh Marsh, of Newbury; Steven Kent, of Haverhill; Robert Dennis, of Yarmouth; and John Smith, of Barnstable - all from Massachusetts. On June 1, 1669, an association of Proprietors led by Daniel Pierce received a private charter for a portion of their land grant with the charge of settling at least sixty families and incorporating the Towne of Woodbridge. The original bounds of the town were set as Piscataway, Elizabethtown, the Arthur Kill, and Raritan River. A government of freeholders would collect rents, set up courts, select militia leaders and ministers, set up a free school, etc.\n\nThe Dunham family's prominence in Woodbridge is reflected by the fine two-story, four room home his youngest son, Benjamin, constructed near the mill. It was built around 1709 of brick imported from Holland and used as ballast in ships. The distinctive checkerboard pattern visible on the first and second floors of the faÃ§ade were created by using Flemish (or Dutch) bond bricklaying techniques. The house was subsequently added onto but still stands. Benjamin Dunham became a founding member of Woodbridge's Trinity Episcopal Church in 1703 and the house became their rectory in 1873. While the mill is no longer standing, one of the millstones is on display outside the house.\n\nJonathan Dunham is the eighth great-grandfather of the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama. He is also the first of Obamaâs Dunham ancestors to be born in America.\n\nJames Parker\n\nJames Parker was born in Woodbridge in 1714, the second of four boys and two girls of Samuel and Jana Parker. When Samuel died in 1725, Jana sought apprenticeships for her boys. James was indentured for 8 years to William Bradford (1719-1791), a pioneering printer from Philadelphia who had resettled in New York as that cityâs chief printer and who established The New-York Gazette newspaper. But by April of 1733, with only 21 months remaining in the apprenticeship, Bradford advertised the remaining indenture for saleâhe evidently didnât have enough work to keep the 19-year-old Parker busy. Rather than allow this to happen, and feeling confident in his skills, Parker joined the ranks of the runaway apprentices. He ended up working in the shop of Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia until 1742, when he returned to New York and made amends with Bradford. With Franklin as a silent partner, he set up his own print shop in Manhattan and would replace Bradford as the city's government and crown printer. His newspaper, The New-York Gazette or The Weekly Post-Boy (right) became the city's newspaper of record.\n\nUp to the 1750s, it had been illegal to have a printing press in New Jersey. Colonial authorities understood the press could be used to support dissent and wished to control information. Presses had only been set up temporarily twice before to print money that, by law, had to be printed in the colony. In 1723, William Bradford came to Perth Amboy to print currency for East Jersey and, in 1728, Samuel Keimer and Benjamin Franklin came from Philadelphia to Burlington to print the same for West Jersey. In both cases, they removed their presses when the job was done. The inconvenience of having to go to New York or Philadelphia to have government materials published finally ended the prohibition and James Parker opened his print shop in his native Woodbridge - the first permanent establishment in the colony. As the provincial and crown printer, his presses produced a wide variety of items: collections of laws, proclamations, paper currency (right), lottery tickets, etc. He also started the New American Magazine which ran from 1758 to 1760. Edited by Samuel Neville in neighboring Perth Amboy, it was the first periodical published in NJ.\n\nThe best evidence suggests that Parker had his print shop in the area of where St. James Roman Catholic School now stands, at the south corner of Amboy Avenue and Grove Street. He inherited property from his father and added more of his own. He held land roughly from modern Grove Street south to the NJ Turnpike and from Amboy Avenue west to Route 9.\n\nLater, in 1763, as Deputy Post Master General for the American Northern Colonies, Franklin undertook a five month long tour inspecting the postal system. He used this as an excuse to visit and stay with friends throughout the colonies, including his old friend, business partner, and postal official, James Parker. On June 9, 1763, Franklin and his daughter Sarah (right-left; nicknamed \"Sally,\" 1743-1808) came to the Woodbridge home of James and Mary Parker for dinner. Also present was the Parker's son, Samuel Franklin Parkerâhis middle name was in honor of Benjamin Franklinâand their daughter Jane, who was good friends with Sally. Franklin's son, William, (1730-1813; right-right) also attended, with his wife, Elizabeth. William had recently been named Royal Governor of New Jersey. They had taken up residence at the Proprietary House in neighboring Perth Amboy."
