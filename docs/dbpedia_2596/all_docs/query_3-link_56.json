        "text": "10 OCTOBER 1939 — CARTERET BENCH\n\nMEMORIAL TO THE NEW JERSEY COLONIES\n\nELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY\n\nTuesday, October 10, 1939, marked another milestone in the history of the National Society, Daughters of the American Colonists, when a Memorial commemorating the formation of the province of New Jersey in 1664 was dedicated in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the first capital of the state. The monument was presented to the state of New Jersey in the name of the National Society.\n\nThe monument is in the form of a large limestone bench, decorated with five bronze tablets, and measures thirty-two feet long and nine feet deep. The basic idea of a bench, a place to rest and contemplate on the heroic men and women who laid the cornerstone of the state is indeed a fine conception for a memorial. The Carteret Bench stands on a plot of ground at the intersection of North Broad Street and Salem Avenue, in Elizabeth, New Jersey; now called North End Park.\n\nAlthough this monument commemorates the valorous deeds of the past it will always mean a great deal more to New Jersey. In the future it will be a mute reminder of the ideals of those early colonists, who entered into what was then a wilderness, in search of freedom and liberty, and it will always be a challenge to hold in reverence the fulfillment of those patriotic ideas.\n\nTwo of the five panels tell of the state’s early beginnings, and the center plaque is a scene in bas-relief showing Lord Carteret’s arrival in New Jersey, and bears the inscription:\n\n“ARRIVAL OF GOV. PHILIP CARTERET, AUGUST, 1665, AND HIS MEETING WITH THE ASSOCIATES”."
