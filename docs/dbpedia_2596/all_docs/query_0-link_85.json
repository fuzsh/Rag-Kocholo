        "text": "This article has been contributed by author Rhoderick W. J. Jones. His book John Ashburnham: Faithful Servant of King Charles I is out now.\n\nAn exhibition of items from the Ashburnham family collection is currently on display at Carisbrooke Castle Museum.\n\nWhen I was appointed Head Gardener & Grounds Manager of Ashburnham Place in East Sussex, I soon realised that there was much more to this historic estate than its beautiful ‘Capability’ Brown landscape of woodlands, lakes and gardens. In the midst of the Ashburnham family’s 900 year story, there is one particular character who was active in the highest society in the land at the most turbulent period of our constitutional history, with an unwavering loyalty to his friend the King – but who today is rarely mentioned in histories of this tumultuous period.\n\nThroughout the conflict John was by the King’s side, and when the tide turned and the Parliamentarians took the upper hand, John was one of the key negotiators with Cromwell and Ireton on the King’s behalf. When King Charles felt sure an assassination attempt was becoming inevitable, it was John who was entrusted to organise the King’s escape. Many historians have blamed John for the King’s decision to go to the Isle of Wight, and for his ultimate failure to secure a deal with Parliament. However my research has led me to conclude that the King always had the final word on all decisions taken – and that as a loyal servant John always did what the King asked of him. Charles acknowledged John’s loyalty in a letter he wrote to the Queen, which refers to:\n\nFollowing defeat in the Civil War and the King’s execution, many Royalists apportioned blame to John for the failure of the King’s cause. The Parliamentarians saw him as a traitor to their cause, and imprisoned him for many years, imposing heavy fines upon him.\n\nYet in spite of all this John survived, and at the restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 Charles II reinstated him to his former position of Groom to the Bedchamber where he served for the rest of his life. John also received such financial reward as the Treasury could afford, in recompense for John’s expenditure on the King’s cause. Nevertheless John was a relatively poor man and remained simply ‘Esquire’ (his descendants achieving an Earldom in 1730) – though he was re-elected as Member of Parliament for Sussex.\n\nJohn died in 1671. He left behind a wealth of primary sources, including an autobiographical narrative of his actions (later published by his descendant the 3rd Earl of Ashburnham in 1830), as well as personal artefacts belonging to the King which are now on display at Carisbrooke Castle Museum.\n\nFast forward 300 years, and the culmination of John’s legacy – following the death of Lady Catherine Ashburnham in 1953 – was the establishment of the Ashburnham Christian Trust in the 1960s by Revd. John Bickersteth, grandson of the 5th Earl Ashburnham, which regularly receives up to 20,000 visitors a year.\n\nI hope that my book, and the public display at Carisbrooke Castle Museum, will bring a wider awareness of the extraordinary story of this man and his friendship and devotion to his King and his God, and the legacy this left for the generations that followed."
