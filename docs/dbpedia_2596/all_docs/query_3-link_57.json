        "text": "Proprietors & Adventurers - Document Images\n\nRecord Book of Robert Barclay, Proprietary Governor of East New Jersey, 1684\n\nThis volume is the most significant item included in the Christie’s acquisition, containing transcriptions of land grants, legal cases, correspondence with officials including William Penn, and a record of the proceedings of East Jersey’s Lords Proprietors during 1682-84. The volume originally also held the five maps purchased separately at the auction (see above). Three documents are shown, as follows:\n\nKing Charles II’s patent of 12 March 1664 (top left) granted a vast expanse of the eastern seaboard to his brother James, Duke of York. The Duke subsequently granted authority for the land and governance of New Jersey to John, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret.\n\nNew Jersey’s first colonial governor, Philip Carteret, asserted ownership of Staten Island based on the language of the 1664 grant to Berkeley and Carteret (top center). New York’s governors disagreed, and the question was not fully resolved until 1834."
