        "text": "The de Carteret family was perhaps the greatest of the patrician families of the Channel Islands. Their influence on the Island lasted from the 10th century until the present time.\n\nThe family originated from Normandy where their ancestor Guy de Carteret was the first Lord of the Barony of Carteret in Normandy. The family sided with William the Conqueror in the Norman conquest. Years later Renaud de Carteret I returned from First Crusade and took the parish of St Ouen by force, establishing the family's presence in the Channel Islands. A descendant of Renaud de Carteret I named Hellier de Carteret colonised the island of Sark and became the first of the Seigneurs of Sark. During the English Civil War, the Great-Grandson of Hellier de Carteret, Sir George Carteret became a prominent Royalist and Friend to King Charles II, he was made Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, Treasurer of the Navy, Member of Parliament and made a Baronet.[1][2] He was also granted lands in the Carolinas and in what eventually became the state of New Jersey. His descendants later became Barons Carteret and the Earls of Granville.[3]\n\nTheir ancestral seat is Saint Ouen's Manor, Jersey, still today owned by persons of that name.\n\nMembers of the family included:\n\nJohn Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 7th Seigneur of Sark, KG, PC\n\nRobert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville\n\nVice Admiral Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet (1610-1680)\n\nSir Philip Carteret, FRS\n\nHenry Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret\n\nSophia Carteret (wife of Prime Minister William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne)\n\nGeorge Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret\n\nSir Philip Carteret, 1st Baronet\n\nSir Philip Carteret, 2nd Baronet\n\nSir Charles Carteret, 3rd Baronet\n\nRenaud de Carteret III (1140-1214)\n\nPhilippe de Carteret, 2nd of St Ouen (1152-11xx)\n\nRenaud de Carteret I (1063-1125)\n\nRenaud de Carteret V (1316-\n\nHellier de Carteret (1563-1578)\n\nPhilippe de Carteret II (1584–1643)\n\nPhilippe de Carteret I (1552–1594)\n\nJason De Carteret (19xx-)\n\nSir Francis de Carteret Attorney-General of Jersey\n\nGeorge William de Carteret (1869 Jersey-4 September 1940)\n\nCecil de Carteret (1886–3 January 1932)\n\nPhilip de Carteret, 8th of St Ouen (14xx-1500)\n\nPhilippe de Carteret III (1620-between 1663 and 1675))\n\nPhilippe de Carteret IV (1650-1693)\n\nCharles de Carteret (1679-1715)\n\nRear-Admiral Philip Carteret, Seigneur of Trinity\n\nSir Philip Carteret Silvester\n\nCapt.
