And whereas the lords commissioners for trade and plantations having examined the said petition, and considered thereof, did, by their report to the said lords of the committee of his majesty's most honorable privy council, offer as their opinion, that it would be for his majesty's service that the said Lord Carteret's property should be separated from that of his majesty, wherein the said Lord Carteret should enjoy whatsoever he was entitled to by the charters of Carolina, and the aforesaid act of parliament; and for the better preventing any difficulties that might attend the setting out an eighth part of the soil of the said province, the said lords commissioners conceive the method proposed by the said Lord Carteret would be most effectual, which said report the said lords of the committee of his majesty's most honorable privy council having taken into their consideration, did agree in opinion with the said lords commissioners for trade and plantations.

and that the said commissioners should make a return of their proceedings herein to his majesty in council, within eighteen months from the date of the said order, and that they should at the same time transmit to his majesty a plan containing a full and exact description of the said lands, together with the respective boundaries thereof, in order to his majesty signifying his royal pleasure, (in case his majesty should approve thereof) for conveying the same to the said Lord Carteret in such manner as shall be advised by his majesty's counsel learned in the law, provided that the said Lord Carteret should at the same time make a surrender to his majesty of all his pretensions to the government of the said provinces of Carolina, and should convey, release and confirm to his majesty, his heirs and successors, the other seven parts of the said provinces as by the said petition and order, relation thereunto likewise being had, may more fully appear.\n\nAnd whereas, commissioners were accordingly appointed on behalf of his majesty, and of the said John Lord Carteret, to set out and allot to the said John Lord Carteret one full eighth part of the said provinces of Carolina, who by their humble report to his majesty in council bearing date the sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and fortythree, did certify that in pursuance of his majesty's said order in council, dated the fifteenth day of September, one thousand seven hundred and fortytwo, and of his majesty's royal instructions thereupon, given the twentyfifth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and fortythree, they did immediately proceed to set out and allot to the said John Lord Carteret one full eighth part of the provinces of Carolina, in one entire separate district, in the province of North Carolina, next adjoining and contiguous to the province of Virginia, which eighth part is bounded to the north by the line that divides Carolina from Virginia, to the east, by the great western ocean, commonly so called, and as far southwardly as a cedar stake set upon the sea side, in the latitude of thirtyfive degrees and thirtyfour minutes at north latitude, being six miles and a half to the southward of Chickmacomack inlet, from that stake by a west line which passed twentyfive feet to the southward of the house wherein Thomas Wallis liveth, and so west as far as the bounds of the charter granted to the lords proprietors of Carolina\n\nby his majesty King Charles the Second, which west line went one thousand six hundred and sixty poles to the north of the south end of Bath-Town, and the said commissioners did, pursuant to the said order in council, transmit to his majesty a plan containing a full and exact description of the said one eighth part of the said provinces or territories, so set out and allotted to the said John Lord Carteret, annexed to their said report, and all which boundaries are marked out and ascertained by the said plan, a true and exact copy whereof is stampt on the fifth skin of these presents; which said return of the said commissions his majesty was pleased by his order in council, bearing date the twentyfirst of March last, to refer to the said lords of the committee of his most honorable privy council, for them to consider thereof, and report their opinion thereupon to his majesty in council; and whereas the said right honorable the lords of the committee of his majesty's most honorable privy council for plantation affairs, did upon consideration thereof, by their report to his majesty in council, bearing date the ninth day of May last, reciting such orders, reports, and proceedings upon the said petition of the Lord Carteret as are herein before recited, agree humbly to report as their opinion, that his majesty might be pleased to approve of the said return and plan of the allotment thereby made to the said Lord Carteret, for his one eighth part of both the provinces of Carolina, and that thereupon it might be advisable for his majesty to order his attorney and solicitor general to prepare the necessary instruments or deeds, conformable to what is contained in the afore mentioned reports of the fifteenth of September, one thousand seven hundred and fortytwo, for conveying, releasing and confirming the said lands to the said Lord Carteret and his heirs, and likewise for the said Lord Carteret's surrendering up to his majesty all his pretensions to the government of the said provinces of Carolina, and for conveying, releasing, and confirming to his majesty, his heirs and successors, the other seven parts of the said provinces.
