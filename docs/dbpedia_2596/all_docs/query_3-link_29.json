        "text": "Lord John Carteret is a historical character who appears in the 2011 Disney live-action film Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.\n\nBackground[]\n\nJohn Carteret was a British statesman who served under alongside King George II. During his duty as a statesman while serving as Lord, he served as one of the King's advisor and knew how to stick to the right side of serving the King, notably residing in St. James's Palace. During the King's reign, the British became aware that Ferdinand VI of Spain sent the Spanish to find the Fountain of Youth; later, after Jack Sparrow was arrested and brought to St. James's Palace, King George was accompanied by Lord John Carteret and Prime Minister Henry Pelham within the Palace.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides[]\n\nAfter Jack Sparrow was arrested and brought to St, James's Palace, Lord John Carteret and Prime Minister Henry Pelham approached him who was brought to the Palace. Pelham asked Jack to know if he had a map after which Carteret said to him that they should confiscate the map and send Jack to execution. After Jack told them that he lost the map, Carteret and Pelham asked him to know if he knows the way to the Fountain of Youth that much so he could send an expedition to the area, which Jack began to inquire that only a ship and a crew would help reach the Fountain. However, Barbossa came in and approached Jack, reuniting with him, as Carteret became aware of Barbossa arriving at the Palace; King George then continued to resume the matter of Barbossa completing his search for the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish arrived.\n\nWhen Jack was planning to escape the Palace, George then started feel humiliated for his plans to escape while Carteret cowered behind the King's seat, as Jack planned to escape the Palace. Jack then grabbed onto a chandelier where the King and his advisors became shocked. After Jack escaped from the Palace, the King then sent Barbossa to continue the expedition for the Fountain of Youth via HMS Providence. However, in the end, the Spanish were successful in destroying the Fountain of Youth, which the British did not realize their intentions.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhile not featured in the junior novelization adaptation of On Stranger Tides, Carteret's dialogue was given to Henry Pelham. Additionally in the movie storybook adaptation of said film, Carteret was depicted on a portrait but was never identified by name.\n\n[]\n\nLord John Carteret on Pirates of the Caribbean Wiki."
