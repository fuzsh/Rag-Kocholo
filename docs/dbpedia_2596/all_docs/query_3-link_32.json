        "text": "It would appear that the origins of our State names would be well-established facts; however, when an attempt is made to trace these origins, they are found to be quite elusive and controversial. In most instances, loose translations are offered as an explanation for the meaning of the original word; this is especially true for State names of Indian origin. Some of the following information is quoted, and some is a composite of ideas and opinions expressed by several authorities. Among the authorities from which parts of the material were gathered are State historical societies, the Bureau of American Ethnology, college and university departments of history, and individual researchers.\n\nA State that many have never heard of -the State of Franklin was named for Benjamin Franklin. In 1784, Franklin was a part of North Carolina's western territory, a part of the grant of Charles II. It broke away from the original territory and elected a legislature' and a governor. For about three years, the two factions were nearly at war. Congress was petitioned by the newly formed State and asked for recognition, but this was not granted. Franklin was ceded to the Federal government in 1790, became the State of Tennessee in 1796, and was admitted to the Union.\n\nFollowing are the 50 States' names, listed alphabetically, with brief explanations of their origins:\n\nALABAMA: From an Indian tribe of the Creek Confederacy originally called the Alabamas or Alibamons, who in turn gave the name to a river from which the State name was derived.\n\nALASKA: From Eskimo word \"alakshak”, meaning peninsula; also said to mean \"great lands.\"\n\nARIZONA: Many authorities attribute the meaning to a word meaning arid zone or desert. Others claim the name is Aztec, from \"arizuma\" meaning \"silver bearing.\" Still another version: attributes the origin to the Papagos tribe of the Southwest, wruc named it from the locality in which they lived called Arizonac, meaning \"site of the small springs\" (lack of water). This place was near the present town of Nogales, and in the early 1700's, silver ..was discovered near here, which gives some credence to the Aztec word \"arizuma.\"\n\nARKANSAS.: Origin uncertain. As usual with words of Indian origin, there are various spellings for this State name, among them Alkansia, Alkansas, and Akamsea. The word, according to some, is of Algonquin origin, and the meaning is unknown. Others say that Arkansas is a French version of \"Kansas, a Sioux Indian name for “south wind people.”\n\nCALIFORNIA: Generally agreed that Cortez first applied the name, the origin is traced to the name of an imaginary island in an old Spanish romance written by Montalvo in 1510. The island is described as an earthly paradise, abundant with gold and precious gems.\n\nCOLORADO: Presumably named from the river bearing the name, although only tributaries flow through the State. Other theories are that it might have come from the Spanish word meaning \"rad\" or \"ruddy,\" describing the color of the stream in various places or the red earth found in some areas.\n\nCONNECTICUT: Appears to be a derivation of the Indian word \"Quonoktacut\" (also Quonecktacut) , interpreted by some to mean \"river whose water is driven in waves by tides O:c:\" winds.\" Other interpretations include \"long river,\" \"the long ({without end) river,\" and \"long river place.\"\n\nDELAWARE: Named for Lord De La Warr, first governor and captain-general of Virginia, who in 1630 explored the bay and river area where his name was first applied.\n\nFLORIDA: In 1513, Ponce de Leon landed here on Easter Sunday, the Spanish Pascua de Flores, meaning \"Feast of Flowers,\" for which the State is named.\n\nGEORGIA.: Named by and for King George II of England.

Some claim it to sterol from an Indian word of unknown meaning, while others claim the mean1img \"gem of the mountains,\" which properly describes the State especially because Indian translations quite often referred to natural features of surrounding country. Another claim is the Shoshone translation of \"Edah hoe,\" or \"light on the mountains.\"\n\nILLINOIS: From the Illini Indian word meaning \"men\" or \"warriors,” supplemented by the French adjective ending \"ois..”\n\nINDIANA: Presumably named from the fact that the land lying along the Ohio River was purchased from the Indians.

The name translates as \"south wind people,\" or \"wind people.\"\n\nKENTUCKY: Origin and meaning controversial. Pioneer George Rogers Clark claimed the name was derived from the Indian word \"Kentake,\" meaning \"meadow land.\" The claim is also made that it stems from the Shawnee word meaning \"at the head of a river\" inasmuch as they used the Kentucky River in traveling throughout the area.

Later, about 1663, the name Carolina was definitely applied by those who had received a grant to the land from Charles II, and so it was named in his honor.\n\nNORTH DAKOTA: From Indian name meaning \"allies. \"' Indian form is - Lakota, Nakota, Lahkota, or Dakota, depending on dialect. \"Allies\" was used to signify the common name of the confederated Sioux tribes.\n\nOHIO: Iroquois Indian word meaning the river of the same name. \"beautiful river,\" taken from the river of the same name.\n\nOKLAHOMA: Choctaw Indian word meaning “red people.\"\n\nOREGON: One theory is that the name is derived from \"origanum,\" a species of wild sage which grows abundantly on the coast of Oregon; another, that it stems from the Spanish \"Oregones,\" which referred to the Indian tribes inhabiting the region and meant \"big-eared men.\" Joaquin Miller, poet of the Sierras\" gave another version - that the name came from the Spanish \"alura agua\" meaning \"gently falling waters.\"\n\nPENNSYLVANIA: This is the only State in the Union named for its founder, William Penn, who wanted to call it \"Sylvania\" because of the extensive forest areas.\n\nRHODE ISLAND: Originally called \"Roode Eylandt'\" by the Dutch Navigator Adrian Block (for whom Block Island was named), presumably from the redness of the clay in the area along the shore. Name was later anglicized to Rhode Island. Also said to have been named from the Island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean, but several historians give this little or no support.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA: Named for Charles II of England, the same as its sister State, North Carolina. (See North Carolina.)\n\nSOUTH DAKOTA: From Sioux Indian name meaning “allies.” (See North Dakota.)\n\nTENNESSEE: Name is of Cherokee origin from a tribe located at a village site called Tanasse (also spelled Tennese).

When the western counties left Virginia (rejecting secession), they retained a portion of the original name.
