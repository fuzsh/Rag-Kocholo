        "text": "on 20 Jan 2004 •\n\nwe think to decline\n\nAnd why Sam and co. aren't involved in these particular payings-off: \"The parliamentary commissioners (provided since 29 December 1660 with additional funds by 12 Car. II c. 27) had held their first meeting (as the statute required) on 12 January. Local commissioners had been appointed to assist them to pay off 65 ships. The Navy Board (normally in charge of pay) was required by the act to supply information, but not to assist in the paying-off.\" (L&M)\n\nA lot of men are losing their positions with these events, so it makes sense that Sam prefers to be uninvolved. At the same time, one doesn't want to be ignored completely . . .\n\non 20 Jan 2004 •\n\nat the Theatre\n\nThe Lost Lady - \"A tragicomedy by Sir William Berkeley, acted and published in 1638; now at the Theatre Royal, Vere St.\" (L&M)\n\nBerkeley had a new world connection: \"Sir William Berkeley (1605-1677) held office longer than any other governor of Virginia, colonial or modern. He was born in 1605 to Sir Maurice and Elizabeth Killigrew Berkeley, both of whom held stock in the Virginia Company of London. Educated at St. Edmund Hall and Merton College in Oxford, he subsequently studied law at the Middle Temple in London before he toured Europe. In 1632, he gained a place in the household of Charles I. That position gave him entré into a court literary circle know as “The Wits” and led to social ties that stood him well for the remainder of his days. He wrote several plays, one of which—The Lost Lady, A Tragi-Comedy—was performed for Charles I and Henrietta Maria.”\n\nhttp://www.iath.virginia.edu/vcdh…\n\nAnd about the seating:\n\n“Above the pit there were usually three tiers of seats: the boxes, where a seat cost 4s., the middle gallery, and the top gallery. Pepys was in the middle gallery; the clerks probably in a special box on the same tier.” (also L&M)\n\non 20 Jan 2004 •\n\nExecutions\n\nSam's attitude to executions does seem rather cold. We know that he was present at the execution of Charles I and commented \"The memory of the wicked shall rot.\" And the at the execution of Thomas Harrison he said \"Thus it was my chance to see the king beheaded at Whitehall and to see the first blood shed in revenge for the blood of the King at Charing Cross.\"\n\nAt the time of the execution of Charles I Sam was stronly Republican, along with Montagu and Monck, and now he is a Royalist. We have also seen that when he was reminded of his comments about Charles I by someone from his old school, he became decidedly nervous! After changing sides he cannot aford to show or write his emotions.\n\nThe poem \"The Vicar of Bray\" sums up our Sam;\n\n\"And this is law, I will maintain\n\nUnto my Dying Day, Sir.\n\nThat whatsoever King may reign,\n\nI will be the Vicar of Bray, Sir!\"\n\nFull poem on www.stthomasu.ca/~hunt/braytext.h…\n\non 20 Jan 2004 •\n\nA cruel time?\n\nI disagree with the assumption that times were so different then and that Sam was a \"child of his time\". One of the most remarkable aspects of Pepys is that he demonstrates through his portrayal of every day life how little human character changes over centuries. Change is not as dramatic as it may appear. Its the details that change not the overall scheme of things. For example, while we may be shocked by the grusomeness of public execution, we are quite capable of accepting equally gruseome actions - but in a form that our realignment of 'right and wrong' makes acceptable to our society. Look at how we justify the attrocities of modern warfare (affecting infinitely more civilians and innocents than in Pepys's day)- and read the details and view pictures and film of it. Pepys teaches us rather more about ourselves than language and history.\n\non 20 Jan 2004 •\n\nIs \"out of sight, out of mind\" the same thing as a lessening of cruelty?\n\nPublic executions were still in force well into the 20th century. The only change seems to be that they gradually went for less messy ways of doing it. Less messy can certainly be equated with less graphic and less upsetting. Moving it behind walls so only the select few witness the act only depersonalizes it, it doesn't make it less cruel.\n\nThus I \"vote\" with those backing Pepys as every bit as human as today. Nowadays we (in the States) may mutter and shake our heads at the news of an execution; Pepys seems to do the same with the traditional mode of executions in his day.\n\nOh, and as a half-jesting aside, I would say my fellow Americans want public executions not to make a pro or con statement. They're just running out of new ideas for reality TV shows.\n\non 21 Jan 2014 •\n\nLyn Believeau raises a question: How many of us keep diaries? Watch out. Here is another word that separates British and American English. What an American Businessman would call an \"Appointments Calendar\", a British Businessman calls \"A Diary\". When one uses the word \"Diary\", the other may misunderstand. It is common office practice on both sides of the pond to keep a schedule of upcoming appointments, work that should be done today, deadlines etc., and at days end, to annotate them to record actions completed or which scheduled tasks were not completed. Filed away, they thus become a record of both expected events and completed events. SP's form of Diary is a whole lot more fun. In the future, will people using electronic \"organizers\" or \"day planners\" use them to keep records of who did what, when, where and how? Will the technology to read their files survive?\n\non 19 Jan 2024 •\n\n\"... wrote by post to Portsmouth to my Lord ...\"\n\nThis must have been a hard letter to write, diplomatically.\n\nDear My Lord:\n\nAll's Well That Ends Well ... on my return from handing out guns at Deptford against the Venner Uprising (which was already over), I learned your wife had lost her mind at the sight of the returning King and his guards and fled with Lady Jem and 8 members of your household, including the musician Wm. Child (whose horse went lame within the hour and returned to Whitehall), to Chatham.\n\nFortunately our friends Cuttance and Blake secured their lodgings, and I was able to catch up with them by dark.\n\nWe assured her the danger is over, and we are all now back in London, no harm done. John Goods had the money to settle the inn bills, and when we toured the Sovereign, Charles and Newcastle to My Lady's delight, I distributed 7l. appropriately.\n\nI'll give my invoice for horse and guide rentals and the gratuities to Mr. Shepley.\n\nWe were sorry to hear about William Hetley, and hope you don't catch the pox.\n\nYour devout friend and cousin, Samuel\n\nP.S. Laud is too old to be a page. He rides well, and is bothering Mary.\n\non 20 Jan 2024 •\n\nAllow us to opine on whether living in such a violent century as this XVII has dulled the sensitivities of the People, and they just shrug at the cartloads of smoking bowels they pass on their way to the theater. We're not inside their heads, and inner feelings leave few fossils, but surely this gruesome justice is meant to horrify! It's not meant to be nice or routine, if it didn't sap the appetite (OK, not Sam's) and cause nightmares what would be the point? And so, watch in fascination and cheer on as they may, we phant'sy that the citizen do find it horrific.\n\nNow, to business. We daily receive news on the sheer audacity of this Venner plot, of the sort which would send a shiver up any king's spine, and make him sign a few more HD&Q orders. In the State Papers today (19 Jan.), a \"Geo. Bushfield\", mercer in Paternoster Row, confesses hearing \"George Tutchins\" say that, since Venner did fail, the phanaticks \"would rise the next moonshiny night, and bring up all their powder, 55 barrels, now at Deptford, to Whitehall\". Nice touch, the werewolfy rising by moonshine; and, if not an idle boast, that would supply quite a boom, given estimates that Guy Fawkes' 36 barrels already amounted to one or two tons of explosive.\n\nAlso today, Sir John Maynard MP, a lawyer, writes to Lord Mordaunt (why him?) that, not only \"so many persons were committed at the last sessions [of the bench in Croydon, Surrey] who will not take the Oath of Allegiance that they are puzzled what to do\", but their chief, \"Dr. Bradley\", is allowed by the gaoler to vent his damnable doctrines among his proselytes\". Surely future centuries will not suffer their jailhouses to be where inmates become, er, \"radicalized\"?\n\nOn the Fifth Monarchists' grand vision, the French Gazette (at https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148…, pages 109-120) is about to reprint (on 4 Feb., new style) a \"Letter of an Englishmen, to one of his friends\", which provides a fascinating, blow-by-blow reportage of last week's events. It alleges, from a Fifth Monarchist \"Manifest\" - possibly an actual document - that the idea was, after felling \"Babyllon, it is the name they give to the Monarchy\", to \"go to the other States, to make their triumph general; to this end, they will gather their Brothers, to detach them from all the Monarchists: & being disposed to die or vainquish (...) they will rise against all the Carnals, who, they say, only seek the possession of the World, & will put their Kings into irons\". This in Louis XIV's propaganda journal, but we thought the idea of exporting the revolution being on the plotters' agenda to be worth mentioning."
