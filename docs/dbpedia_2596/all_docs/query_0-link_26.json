        "text": "The earliest type of land records in North Carolina were headrights, also known as landrights, a common land grant system used in all of the original 13 colonies. In summary, headrights gave each grantee a particular amount of land based on the number of people they brought into the colony. Those people could have been enslaved, indentured servants, or free men, women, and children. Although land could be purchased outright, obtaining land through headright was much more common. It should be noted that headrights were granted, not purchased. It was given simply for bringing people into the colony. The Declaration of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina allowed the system in the Carolinas. Section 7 of the Declaration specifies how much will be given for each person brought in to settle the colony.\n\nThe earliest headright was dated September 25, 1663 and the practice continued until it was abolished in the 1744 due to abuse of the system. There were modifications made in 1712 as well. It was always assumed ones a person received a headright, they would remain in the state, but due to abuses of the system, a stipulation was added in 1712 requiring the person had to reside in the colony six (6) months before they could make a claim of headright.\n\nBefore 1734, headrights could be proved in several ways: before a magistrate, by oath in court, or by oath at the governor's council. In 1734, the Lords Proprietor headrights could only be claimed in the court where the person resided, to the governor's council, or to the General Court of the colony.\n\nAs stated above, headrights were given for enslaved people and servants brought into the state. For servants, they could receive a \"freedom\" headright at the conclusion of their term of indenture. Learn more about the headright system from NCpedia.\n\nThere were eight (8) Lords Proprietor that governed different areas of the state through 1775. The eight men were Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon; George Monck, Duke of Albemarle; William, Lord Craven; John, Lord Berkeley; Anthony, Lord Ashley; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Berkeley (brother of John); and Sir John Colleton.\n\nProprietors had land offices set up in the state. If a person wanted a parcel of land, they filed an application, which is known as an entry. The next step of the process was an order from the land office to the surveyor, this is known as a warrant. The surveyor returned his findings with a plat that described the land. The final step was a land patent, often referred to as a grant, given to the person who made the application in exchange for a sum of money.\n\nThese records are on file with the Secretary of State's office and located in the State Archives of North Carolina. These record can be found in the Archives catalog of some records called DOC. With the information in the MARS record, you can request a copy of the original through the State Archives.\n\nCharles II died in 1685. Forty-two years later, in 1727, George the II was crowned King of England. The Lords Proprietors, with the exception Earl Granville, returned their rights to the land given to them by Charles II, effectively ending the grants from the Lords Proprietors in 1729."
