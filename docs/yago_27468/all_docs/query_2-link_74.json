        "text": "When people ask me what my all-time favorite song is, I’m not the guy who says, “Oh, there’s too many to choose from. I can’t possibly pick!” My answer is always, “Hook,” by Blues Traveler, not because it’s the best-sounding song in the world (although, it’s great) or because I have some great emotional attachment to it. I love “Hook” because I think it’s the smartest song that has ever been written. I’ve written about it before, and spoken about it on the podcast, as well.\n\nAll of which is to say: You have no idea how gleeful I was when Benjamin Bratt’s character in Poker Face worked the lyrics to “Hook” (also the name of the episode) into a monologue in the season finale. I do wonder, however, whether Rian Johnson and Co. really understand what the song is about, because its use in the episode — to try and create a tone that is “funny, but it’s also frightening,” according to co-showrunner Lilla Zuckerman — is not exactly in keeping with the message of the song.\n\nCreator Rian Johnson, who wrote the finale, had a different explanation for the use of the song. “The whole episode is kinda about the format of the show, and the addictive little hooks in life that pull us into situations,” Johnson explained to THR via email. “These catchy little tunes, hip three-minute ditties — that also describes each episode of Poker Face … So, using the episode to look at the format of the show and the actual effects on Charlie’s life being caught in that seemed interesting.”\n\nThat’s more in line with John Popper’s original meaning, but not quite. The song is about selling out. Specifically, it’s about selling out to a kind of algorithm. It’s not about making something good or important, it’s about mindlessly giving the audience what it wants based on what the audience’s mind has been conditioned to love. It’s literally Pachelbell’s “Canon,” and the greatest genius of “Hook” is that the song itself is a sell-out. Popper is telling the listener that his song is crap, that he’s only giving us what we want to hear, and that we’re too dumb to tell the difference.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what I say\n\nSo long as I sing with inflection\n\nThat makes you feel I’ll convey\n\nSome inner truth or vast reflection\n\nBut I’ve said nothing so far\n\nAnd I can keep it up for as long as it takes\n\nHe’s saying he could spew a bunch of nonsense words, and it wouldn’t matter what he said, because it’s the hook — the jingle, the pop ditty — that will catch in your mind and stay for days. He doesn’t even mean what he’s saying:\n\nI am being insincere\n\nIn fact I don’t mean any of this\n\nPopper has written the perfect algorithmic pop song and he knows that MTV will play it, even though he’s using it to mock the kind of sh*t that MTV was playing at the time:\n\nWhat you’re doing to me, this MTV is not for free\n\nIt’s so PC it’s killing me\n\nThis is not about craft or creativity. There is no luck involved. It’s cynical kowtowing to the algorithm.\n\nAnd when I’m feeling stuck and need a buck\n\nI don’t rely on luck because\n\nThe hook brings you back\n\nIt’s the greatest fuck-you metafictional song in the history of music — I wanna bust all your balloons I wanna burn all your cities to the ground — it’s the close-up magic of songs — suck it in suck it in suck it in — and he’s Babe Ruth telling us he’s going to hit a home run. He is snowing us, telling us that you will love this song, that it will get stuck in your head for days, that you are powerless to stop it.\n\nBecause that hook brings you back\n\nI ain’t tellin’ you no lie\n\nThe hook brings you back\n\nOn that you can rely"
