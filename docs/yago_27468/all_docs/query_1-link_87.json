        "text": "George Lucas\n\nAmerican director, producer, and screenwriter\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 28, 2024, 5:32 PM ET (AP)\n\nPrincess Leia bikini costume from set of 'Star Wars' movie sells at auction for $175K\n\nGeorge Lucas (born May 14, 1944, Modesto, California, U.S.) is an American motion-picture director, producer, and screenwriter who created several of the most popular films in history.\n\nEarly life and work\n\nThe son of a small-town stationer and a mother who was often hospitalized for long periods for ill health, Lucas was an early reader of classic adventure stories such as Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe and Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, an avid collector of comic books, and a keen student of history. He became interested in filmmaking while in high school. He was also a car-racing fanatic as a teenager until a near-fatal crash at age 18 convinced him to give up the sport.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nLucas’s interest in moviemaking was encouraged by cinematographer Haskell Wexler. In 1966 Lucas received a bachelor’s degree from the film department of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. While there, future director John Milius, a classmate, introduced Lucas to the work of Japanese director Kurosawa Akira, who would be an important influence on Lucas’s work. Lucas made several highly acclaimed student films, including the futuristic parable Electronic Labyrinth THX 1138 4EB, which took first prize at the National Student Film Festival in 1965.\n\nLucas served a six-month internship in 1967 at Warner Brothers, where he assisted Francis Ford Coppola on Finian’s Rainbow (1968). He followed that experience by shooting a “making-of” documentary about Coppola’s The Rain People (1969). Lucas also shot a portion of the documentary Gimme Shelter (1970), about the violent Rolling Stones concert at the 1969 Altamont Festival, for Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin.\n\nTHX 1138, the founding of Lucasfilm, and American Graffiti\n\nWarner Brothers–Seven Arts signed Lucas to direct a feature-length version of his prizewinning student film, with Coppola executive-producing and Robert Duvall and Maggie McOmie starring as the illicit lovers. A grim fantasy about a robotized, dehumanized society in the distant future, THX 1138 (1971) was released to respectful reviews, although its obvious debt to George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-four and overly deliberate pace kept it from being embraced too enthusiastically by either critics or audiences. The film also was one of the first made through Coppola’s American Zoetrope studio, which would go on to create some of the most-memorable films of the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nIn 1971 Lucas formed the production company Lucasfilm Ltd., which eventually contained a number of divisions, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM, established 1975), which was regarded as the most prestigious special-effects workshop in American film.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Shot in less than a month for well under a million dollars, American Graffiti became one of the top grossing films of the decade—and with its modest cast of newcomers (including Richard Dreyfuss, erstwhile child star Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford in a small role) may have been among the most profitable as well.\n\nStar Wars\n\nThe success of American Graffiti enabled Lucas to finance a project that had been dear to his heart for some time. Science fiction had traditionally been a poor box-office performer, with such rare exceptions as Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) only proving the rule. However, with Star Wars (1977), which he also wrote, Lucas eschewed the high-tech dystopian allegory then current in science-fiction films in favor of space opera synthesized with vintage Hollywood swashbucklers and frontier adventures.\n\nA space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centers on Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker, his mentor the wise Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo (Ford) are tasked with saving Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from captivity on the Death Star, a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader, whose deep, mechanically augmented voice (contributed by James Earl Jones) became instantly iconic. At the core of the film and the franchise it initiated is the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil. The Jedi Order is a monk-like organization dedicated to peace and the light side of the Force, while the Sith exploit base impulses and the dark side of the Force.\n\nStar Wars, later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope, borrowed heavily from the ideas of mythographer Joseph Campbell and from the story of Kurosawa’s Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958; The Hidden Fortress). Lucas’s film was immediately popular and eventually made more than $775 million worldwide. It was the first of Lucas’s films to be made with a generous budget, which he extended by shooting on soundstages in England, then far less expensive than Hollywood. The film’s success spawned a host of other science-fiction films using the same special-effects technologies developed at ILM that A New Hope had used so effectively.\n\nThe growth of Lucasfilm\n\nWith A New Hope in theaters, Lucas quietly announced his intention to retire from directing and make Lucasfilm an incubator for films to be directed by others under his tutelage. He added, however, that he could envision returning to directing “about 20 years from now,” toward the end of the filming schedule for an ambitious series to be born from A New Hope. Lucas served as executive producer of the other two episodes in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983).\n\nLucas also created the popular character of the adventurous archaeologist Indiana Jones, who was played by Ford in a series of films, beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), directed by Steven Spielberg. Lucas was an executive producer. Working exclusively as a producer throughout the 1980s and most of the ’90s, Lucas had a few minor successes (Willow, 1988) and spectacular failures (Howard the Duck, 1986). He fulfilled a long-standing ambition by serving as executive producer on Kurosawa’s Kagemusha (1980).\n\nLucas created the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992–93), about the adventures of Jones as a child and teenager in the early 20th century. The series was not a ratings success, but it allowed Lucas and ILM to experiment with new techniques in special effects. In 1997 he added new computerized effects to the original three Star Wars films and reissued them to great box-office success, though critics were less enthusiastic. Those films generated interest for one of the most highly anticipated releases of the decade, Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace (1999), the first installment in a prequel trilogy about the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker. For that film, which received mixed reviews but reaped enormous profits, Lucas returned to the director’s chair for the first time in more than 20 years, just as he had foreseen doing in 1977.\n\nLucas followed with Star Wars: Episode II—Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III—Revenge of the Sith (2005), both of which he also directed, before returning to an executive production role on the fourth Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), which Spielberg directed. Lucas created two animated television series, Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003–05) and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–20). He was then executive producer of Red Tails (2012), an action-packed account of the Tuskegee Airmen and his first film in nearly two decades that was not affiliated with either the Star Wars or Indiana Jones franchises.\n\nApart from the films he directed and produced, among them some of the most profitable productions in Hollywood history, Lucas enjoyed as part of his legacy Lucasfilm’s network of properties, studios, and subsidiary companies. In 2012 the Walt Disney Company purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion, and it made a third Star Wars trilogy: Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens (2015), Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi (2017), and Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Disney also created the stand-alone movies Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018). The company then continually released Star Wars content on its Disney+ video streaming platform following its launch in 2019.\n\nLucas was named a Kennedy Center honoree in 2015.\n\nMichael Barson The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
