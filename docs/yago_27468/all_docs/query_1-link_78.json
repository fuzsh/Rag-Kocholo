        "text": "Click on Get Started to upload the video you want to blur over to your Flixier library. You can also bring videos over from cloud storage services such as Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive, as well as paste in YouTube links.\n\nDrag your video down to the timeline at the bottom of the screen. Go to the Shape tab, click on the drop-down arrow next to the square icon and select Square Mask. From the right side menu, select the Blur or Pixelate options. You can resize or reposition your mask by dragging on its edges, or move it around on the timeline to change when it comes up on screen and how long it stays there for. Add Keyframes to your mask to make it move around the screen and follow your subject around the frame.\n\nWhen you’re done blurring the faces in our video, click the Export button in the top right corner. Flixier will take a few minutes to process it and then you’ll be able to save it to your computer or publish it online.\n\nI'm so relieved I found Flixier. I have a YouTube channel with over 700k subscribers and Flixier allows me to collaborate seamlessly with my team, they can work from any device at any time plus, renders are cloud powered and super super fast on any computer.\n\nAnja Winter, Owner, LearnGermanWithAnja\n\nMy main criteria for an editor was that the interface is familiar and most importantly that the renders were in the cloud and super fast. Flixier more than delivered in both. I've now been using it daily to edit Facebook videos for my 1M follower page.\n\nEvgeni Kogan\n\nI’ve been looking for a solution like Flixier for years. Now that my virtual team and I can edit projects together on the cloud with Flixier, it tripled my company’s video output! Super easy to use and unbelievably quick exports.\n\nSteve Mastroianni - RockstarMind.com"
