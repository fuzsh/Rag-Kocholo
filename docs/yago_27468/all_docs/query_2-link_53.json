        "text": "What Is a Breath-Holding Spell?\n\nA breath holding spell is when a child holds their breath, usually after being angry, frustrated, startled, or in pain. Sometimes the breath holding leads to the child passing out.\n\nIt can be frightening to watch a breath-holding spell, but they aren’t harmful and usually last less than a minute. Kids outgrow the spells without any treatment.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Breath-Holding Spells?\n\nThere are two types of breath-holding spells:\n\nIf the child’s face turns blue, it’s called a cyanotic breath-holding spell. Usually the child cries very hard and then has the spell. Cyanotic breath-holding spells are usually caused by anger or frustration.\n\nIf the child’s face turns white, it’s called pallid breath-holding spell. The child may cry a little bit or not at all before having the spell. Pallid breath-holding spells are usually caused by the child being startled or in pain.\n\nBoth types of spells can make kids pass out for up to a minute. In the most extreme cases, kids might have seizures. Having a seizure does not cause any long-term harm or put a child at risk for a seizure disorder.\n\nBreath-holding spells happen in healthy children from 6 months to 6 years old. They’re most common when kids are 6–18 months old, and tend to run in families.\n\nWhat Causes Breath Holding Spells?\n\nChildren do not have breath-holding spells on purpose. They can’t control when they happen.\n\nDoctors don’t know the exact cause of breath-holding spells. Sometimes, iron-deficiency anemia might cause them. Treating the anemia may help reduce the number of spells.\n\nWhat Should I Do if My Child Has a Breath-Holding Spell?\n\nIf this is your child's first breath-holding spell, get medical care. Although the spells aren't harmful, it's good to get your child checked out.\n\nIf your child has a breath-holding spell:\n\nLay your child in the crib or on the floor.\n\nKeep your child away from anything hard or sharp.\n\nStay with your child.\n\nIf your child passes out:\n\nTry to stay calm and reassure yourself that your child is safe.\n\nCheck your child's mouth for food or any object that could cause choking.\n\nCall 911 if your child remains blue or is not breathing for longer than a minute.\n\nAfter the breath holding spell:\n\nReassure your child that everything is OK and that the spell is not their fault.\n\nCan Breath-Holding Spells Be Prevented?\n\nYour doctor can work with you on ways to try to limit your child’s spells. If your child typically has a breath-holding spell after crying, you can try to prevent your child from getting upset. For example, you can:\n\nMake sure your child doesn’t get too tired or hungry.\n\nTry to use calm discipline methods.\n\nIt’s can be hard to watch your child have a spell, but try not to give in to tantrums or unreasonable behavior just to prevent one. Talk to your doctor if you need help finding the best way to discipline your child.\n\nRemind yourself that the breath-holding spells are not harmful and that your child will outgrow them. If you are very worried about the spells, talking to a mental health professional can help you find ways to cope."
