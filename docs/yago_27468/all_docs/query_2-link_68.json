        "text": "I Never Knew How Blue Blueness Could Be\n\nby Sigrun Hodne\n\nLets dive in, give in, lets go where things already have gotten tricky, messy – confused, where words and meanings are bouncing off in different directions, lets have a look at fragment number fifty-one:\n\n51. You might as well act as if objects had the colors, The Encyclopedia says. –Well, it is as you please. But what would it look like to act otherwise?\n\nIndeed, what would it look like to act otherwise?\n\nMaggie Nelson’s book Bluets (Wave Books, 2009) is a bastard, a hybrid, transgressing all and every genre, as they are yet known. Partly essay, partly poetry, it’s a collection of fragments, of quotations, a memoir with a hint of philosophical investigations. Bluets won’t land in any category. But let’s, for the sake of simplicity, call it a long lyrical essay.\n\nA long lyrical essay on the color blue—blue in a public, scientific, and historical sense, but also blue in the most personal sense.\n\nThere are several plot-lines: love, pain, friendship, and loss, to mention just a few.\n\nThis is how it all begins:\n\n1. Suppose I were to begin by saying that I had fallen in love with a color. Suppose I were to speak this as though it were a confession; suppose I shredded my napkin as we spoke. It began slowly. An appreciation, an affinity. Then one day, it became more serious. Then (looking into an empty teacup, its bottom stained with thin brown excrement coiled into the shape of a sea horse) it became somehow personal.\n\nIn art-history, color has often been understood as secondary to form, as something that “fills” the form. In Nelson’s work color take on the lead role (– just as love, the color blue is not an optional supplement, an accidental add-on).\n\n2. And so, I fell in love with a color—in this case, the color blue—as if falling under a spell, a spell I fought to stay under and get out from under, in turns.\n\nA book about the color blue, what a peculiar idea!\n\n13. At a job interview at a university, three men sitting across from me at a table. On my CV it says that I am currently working on a book about the color blue. I have been saying this for years without writing a word. It is, perhaps, my way of making my life feel “in progress” rather than an ash of sleeve falling off a lit cigarette. One of the men asks Why blue? People ask me this question often. I never know how to respond. We don’t get to choose what or whom we love, I want to say. We just don’t get to choose.\n\nLet’s go back to where we started, repeating our initial question: “… what would it look like to act otherwise?”\n\n53. “We mainly suppose the experiential quality to be an intrinsic quality of the physical object” —this is the so-called systematic illusion of color. Perhaps it is also that of love. But I am not willing to go there—not just yet. I believed in you.\n\n“Acting otherwise,” rejecting the systematic illusion of color is, I believe, to abandon a very central social norm: an understanding of the world as a place looking in a certain way – the same way – for each and every one of us. Systematic illusions are the basis of our impression that we share an external reality; it’s the place we meet and interconnect. Systematic illusions make us believe in a common world. ‘Acting otherwise’ is to reject common sense, renouncing the company of humans, and thereby subjecting oneself to alienation and solitude. The extreme consequence of rejecting the systematic illusions of humanity is finally ostracization, solipsism—\n\n—falling silent.\n\n“… But I am not willing to go there—not just yet….”\n\nBluets, An Excerpt\n\nby Maggie Nelson\n\n14. I have enjoyed telling people that I am writing a book\n\nabout blue without actually doing it. Mosty what happens\n\nin such cases is that people give you stories or leads\n\nor gifts, and then you can play with these things instead\n\nof with words. Over the past decade I have been given\n\nblue inks, paintings, postcards, dyes, bracelets, rocks,\n\nprecious stones, watercolors, pigments, paperweights,\n\ngoblets, and candies. I have been introduced to a man\n\nwho had one of his front teeth replaced with lapis lazuli,\n\nsolely because he loved the stone, and to another who\n\nworships blue so devoudy that he refuses to eat blue food\n\nand grows only blue and white flowers in his garden,\n\nwhich surrounds the blue ex-cathedral in which he lives.\n\nI have met a man who is the primary grower of organic indigo\n\nin the world, and another who sings Joni Mitchell’s\n\nBlue in heartbreaking drag, and another with the face of a\n\nderelict whose eyes literally leaked blue, and I called this\n\none the prince of blue, which was, in fact, his name.\n\n15. I think of these people as my blue correspondents,\n\nwhose job it is to send me blue reports from the field.\n\n…\n\n23. Goethe wrote Theory of Colours in a period of his life\n\ndescribed by one critic as “a long interval, marked by\n\nnothing of distinguished note.” Goethe himself describes\n\nthe period as one in which “a quiet, collected state\n\nof mind was out of the question.” Goethe is not alone in\n\nturning to color at a particularly fraught moment. Think\n\nof filmmaker Derek Jarman, who wrote his book Chroma\n\nas he was going blind and dying of AIDS, a death he also\n\nforecast on film as disappearing into a “blue screen.” Or\n\nof Wittgenstein, who wrote his Remarks on Colour during\n\nthe last eighteen months of his life, while dying of\n\nstomach cancer. He knew he was dying; he could have\n\nchosen to work on any philosophical problem under the\n\nsun. He chose to write about color. About color and pain.\n\nMuch of this writing is urgent, opaque, and uncharacteristically\n\nboring. “That which I am writing about so tediously,\n\nmay be obvious to someone whose mind is less\n\ndecrepit,” he wrote.\n\n…\n\n65. The instructions printed on the blue junk’s wrapper:\n\nWrap Blue in cloth. Stir while squeezing the Blue in the last\n\nrinsing water. Dip articles separately for a short time; keep\n\nthem moving. I liked these instructions. I like blues that\n\nkeep moving.\n\n66. Yesterday I picked up a speck of blue I’d been eyeing\n\nfor weeks on the ground outside my house, and found it\n\nto be a poison strip for termites. Noli me tangere, it said,\n\nas some blues do. I left it on the ground.\n\n67. A male satin bowerbird would not have left it there. A\n\nmale satin bowerbird would have tottered with it in his\n\nbeak over to his bower, or his “trysting place,” as some\n\nfield guides put it, which he spends weeks adorning with\n\nblue objects in order to lure a female. Not only does the\n\nbowerbird collect and arrange blue objects—bus tickets,\n\ncicada wings, blue flowers, bottle caps, blue feathers\n\nplucked off smaller blue birds that he kills, if he must, to\n\nget their plumage—but he also paints his bower with\n\njuices from blue fruits, using the frayed end of a twig as a\n\npaintbrush. He builds competitively, stealing treasures\n\nfrom other birds, sometimes trashing their bowers entirely.\n\n…\n\n145. In German, to be blue–-blau sein—means to be\n\ndrunk. Delirium tremens used to be called the “blue\n\ndevils,” as in “my bitter hours of blue-devilism” (Burns,\n\n1787). In England “the blue hour” is happy hour at the\n\npub. Joan Mitchell—abstract painter of the first order,\n\nAmerican expatriate living on Monet’s property in\n\nFrance, dedicated chromophile and drunk, possessor of\n\na famously nasty tongue, and creator of arguably my favorite\n\npainting of all time, Les Bluets, which she painted\n\nin 1973, the year of my birth—found the green of spring\n\nincredibly irritating. She thought it was bad for her work.\n\nShe would have preferred to live perpetually in “l’heure\n\nde hleu,” Her dear friend Frank O’Hara understood. Ah\n\ndaddy, I wanna stay drunk many days, he wrote, and did.\n\n146. “When a woman drinks it’s as if an animal were\n\ndrinking, or a child,” Marguerite Duras once wrote. “It’s\n\na slur on the divine in our nature.” In Crack Wars, Avital\n\nRonell refers to Duras’s works as “alchoholizations”—as\n\nsaturated, so to speak, with the substance. Could one\n\nimagine a book similarly saturated, but with color? How\n\ncould one tell the difference? And if “saturation” means\n\nthat one simply could not absorb or contain one single\n\ndrop more, why does “saturation” not bring with it a\n\nconnotation of satisfaction, either in concept, or in\n\nexperience?\n\n…\n\n148. The Tuareg wear flowing robes so bright and rich\n\nwith blue that over time the dye has seeped into their skin,\n\nliterally blueing it. They are desert nomads who were famously\n\nunwilling to be converted to Islam: thus their name.\n\nSome American Christians have been bothered by\n\nthis idea of a blue people abandoned by God living in the\n\nSahara, herding camels, traveling by night, and navigating\n\nby the stars. In Virginia, in 2002, for example, a group of\n\nSouthern Baptists organized a day of prayer exclusively\n\nfor the Tuareg, “so that they will know God loves them.”\n\n149. It should be noted that the Tuareg do not call themselves\n\nTuareg. Nor do they call themselves the blue people.\n\nThey call themselves Imohag, which means “free\n\nmen.”\n\n150. For Plato, color was as dangerous a narcotic as poetry.\n\nHe wanted both out of the republic. He called painters\n\n“mixers and grinders of multi-colored drugs,” and color\n\nitself a form of pharmakon. The religious zealots of the\n\nReformation felt similarly: they smashed the stained-glass\n\nwindows of churches, thinking them idolatrous, degenerate.\n\nFor distinct reasons, which had to do with the fight\n\nto keep the cheap, slave-labor crop of indigo out of a\n\nWestern market long dominated by woad, the blue-dye\n\nproducing plant native to Europe, indigo blue was called\n\n“the devil’s dye.” And before blue became a “holy”\n\ncolor-which had to do with the advent ofultramarine in\n\nthe twelfth century, and its subsequent use in stained\n\nglass and religious paintings—it often symbolized the Antichrist.\n\n…\n\n177· Perhaps it is becoming clearer why I felt no romance\n\nwhen you told me that you carried my last letter with you,\n\neverywhere you went, for months on end, unopened.\n\nThis may have served some purpose for you, but whatever\n\nit was, surely it bore little resemblance to mine. I\n\nnever aimed to give you a talisman, an empty vessel to\n\nflood with whatever longing, dread, or sorrow happened\n\nto be the day’s mood. I wrote it because I had something\n\nto say to you.\n\nAbout Maggie Nelson"
