        "text": "Face was the mascot of Nick Jr. from September 1994 up to October 2004 when Piper replaced Face as the new host from 2004 up to 2007. He would often sing songs and announce what TV show was coming on next. On occasion, he would even interact with a character from a Nick Jr. show or short (usually from the one he's announcing), such as Blue and Periwinkle from Blue's Clues, the titular character from Little Bill, Bob from Bob the Builder (from offscreen), and even Philomena Fly from What's the Buzz with Philomena Fly. His signature phrase was not a sentence, but was actually his imitation trumpet noises, which he often made after mentioning the programming block's name (\"Too too toot\") (sometimes misspelled as \"brr brr brr\" on a subtitle caption, and by fans) usually followed by a giggle. He also appeared in the UK version of the block from 1995 until September 2005, Germany (as Gesicht), Australia until 2006, Mexico (as Cara), and France (as Visage). In the UK, he was voiced by David Holt; his Australian voice is currently unknown.\n\nFace's last day of hosting Nick Jr. aired on Friday, October 8, 2004, after a Dora marathon. Face would continue to appear on the Nick Jr. block in Australia until 2006.\n\nOn October 11, 2004, Face was replaced by Piper Possum as the Nick Jr. mascot. Before that, in September 2003, Face was redesigned with a new mouth, new eyes, eyebrows, and a new voice actor. The redesign was not well-received and he returned to his old design a few months later. He is the only Nick Jr. mascot to exist on the block for more than three years, and actually still appears on a few of the Nick Jr. website's games. He also made a few appearances on a special New Year's-themed broadcast of The '90s Are All That with Stick Stickly on December 31st, 2011. He also attempted to find the Easter Bunny during Easter 2016.\n\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Face would be returning as the host of a new show for Nick Jr. titled Face's Music Party.[1] They also had a cuter redesign for the show.\n\nBiography\n\nNickJr.com description\n\nFace hosts the danciest, singin’est, bopiest party ever and welcomes everyone to join the fun! Party newbie? No Worries! Face will teach you a new dance craze or a fun joke to share with friends. Virtuoso harpist? Face will crank up the spotlight so you can show your stuff. With unstoppable passion for music, comedy and fun, Face’s favorite pastime is sharing new songs, dances and stories - so come to the party and get ready to move it!\n\nPersonality\n\nFace has the personality of an adult but the curiosity and playfulness of a child. He's kind of like an older sibling, or a really immature aunt or uncle that never grew up. Maybe you have one.\n\nAppearance\n\nFace has a mouth (with teeth and a tongue) and two eyes. He can appear in most any color but his features remain black lines (except his mouth and teeth).\n\nSkills\n\nTrivia\n\nDespite being one of the most well-known mascots of Nick Jr., due to his exceptionally large appearance, some children—especially those with autism—were scared of him growing up, sometimes even after his removal. while other kids liked him. This is roughly similar to that of Dairy Queen's commercial mascot from 2006 to 2011, a mouth; this might have been the case of triggering dreams during the night. The same conditions may also apply to other applications, such as the song \"Stadium Rave\" (featured in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Jellyfish Jam\"), as well as THX's \"Deep Note\" audio logo used before the beginning of a film on certified home media (and even in a scene during the 2006 DreamWorks film, Over the Hedge).\n\nFace, along with Stick Stickly, returned to The '90s are All That during New Year's Eve 2012. His appearances consisted of out-of-context clips that make him appear to be drunk or making off-color comments (e.g. \"Yeah, grow a pair!\").\n\nAfter this, Face once again returned to NickSplat in Easter 2016; this time, his appearance consisted of clips that make him appear to ask viewers if they see an Easter Bunny.\n\nFace is similar in design to the Hint Blocks on the Nintendo 64 video game Yoshi's Story, but with orange circles added.\n\nThe Australian Face voice actor is currently unknown, but it was rumored several times that the voice is Charlie Adler, but there is no evidence or source between that, so the truth of a actor who really does the voice for the Australian version is currently unknown.\n\nThe detail of Face's face changed juristically from the the 90's to the 2000's, there was even a version of Face that was completely unique to any of the other versions especially with a different face and voice.\n\nFace's gender identity changed in the time between the character's original appearance and Face's Music Party. In the original bumpers, Face was explicitly male, while in Music Party, their gender is more ambiguous, and they take on both masculine and feminine forms. In an interview with showrunner David Kleiler, Face was written to have no defined gender.[2] In addition, official episode descriptions use \"they/them\" pronouns when refering to Face.\n\nIn the Face's Music Party premiere episode \"Friendship\", Face temporarily changes to their original appearance on an old fashioned TV when they tell the viewers (of the current time) \"Your parents might remember me as the OG emoji from a long time ago\", referencing their time as Nick Jr.'s mascot in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAudio\n\nhttps://nickelodeon.fandom.com/wiki/File:PKFR6052.ogg Face bumpers that were played during commercials\n\nGallery\n\n1994-1996\n\n1997-1999\n\n2000-2003\n\n2003-2004\n\n2022-present"
