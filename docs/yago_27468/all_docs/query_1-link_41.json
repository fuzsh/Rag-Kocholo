        "text": "With Disney’s 45th live action movie coming out this week(Aladdin), we decided to construct a list of the top ten movies with blue characters. Honestly, I think you’ll be more surprised by how many great movies involve a blue character than you will be by anything in the “new” Aladdin movie! Let us know which blue character is your favorite on Twitter! Also, I(Blake) can do a really good impersonation of one of the blue characters below. Bonus points if you can guess it. Tweet me your best guess!\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see a movie starring Malcolm in the Middle-era Frankie Muniz, pre-Twitter rants Amanda Bynes, and Paul Giamatti with a blue tint, do I have the movie for you! Big Fat Liar is not only a movie aimed at children and adults alike, but it is a love letter to Hollywood. After movie mogul Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals Jason Shepherd’s (Muniz) idea and turns it into the next big blockbuster, Jason and his friend Kailey (Bynes), go to Hollywood to prove that the story was Jason’s in the first place. For the next hour and a half, audiences are treated to increasingly elaborate hijinks, as Jason and Kailey travel through tinsel town trying to get Wolf to admit what he did. Big Fat Liar is full of laughs, movie memorabilia, and celebrity cameos that are fun for all ages. The movie still holds up over fifteen years later and is a fun reminder why Muniz and Bynes were so well loved at such a young age. (Logan Van Winkle)\n\nRemember when Disney/Pixar made new movies rather than remakes? I do. Back in my day, we got original stories and this is one of the best! This concept is just pure genius and the voice acting is stellar. The jokes are aplenty and the humor works just as good when you revisit it as an aged adult as it did when you watched it as a youngster. When I make the list of movies to show my currently non-existent young-ins, this is going to be very high up there. (Blake Hodges)\n\nLet’s talk for a minute about a movie that seems to be everywhere (or at least covering your local Hot Topic): The Nightmare Before Christmas. I could gush about this movie for all of the aspects that work: the voicework, the visuals, the music, the story, the creativity, etc… but instead, what\n\nI will do is focus on the blue character, Sally. For a character that was not in the original story (only Jack, Zero, and Santa were), Sally comes off fleshed out and together as a character can be (pun intended). Sally is a character that elevates Nightmare because of who she is. She is creative, witty, creepy, and even though a damsel in distress also an icon for girls. But Sally also\n\nelevates the character of Jack and completes him as a character. For Sally and Jack, it’s no wonder that Blink-182 suggests we can live like them if we want and I think we all should want. (Aaron Schweitzer)\n\nIn 1997 Luc Besson created a truly influential and one of kind Sci-Fi Film under the name of The Fifth Element. The film is chalked with a number of breathtaking scenes that include unparalleled Costume Design, phenomenal world building and a cast of unique characters. In reference to unique characters, one that makes a huge impact with the smallest amount of screentime has to be the elegant and talented Diva, Plavalaguna. The combination of the physical performance of Actress Maïwenn Le Besco and the stunning vocal talents of Inva Mulla Tchako makes for a truly memorable scene and character. Her luminescent blue skin, long flowing tentacles and gorgeous ornate obsidian accessories add to her beautiful singing voice and grand hand gestures. Her performance is queued perfectly to the movements of Leeloo as she takes on a pack of Mangalores. With each note the transitions to Leeloo fighting intensify and flow seamlessly due to the spectacular editing. The strength of the scene is how perfect the timing is of the cuts with the fight choreography and each blow that is thrown. It is no small feat to create such a memorable character like the Diva and the creative minds of The Fifth Element should be truly proud for this terrific sequence. (Joseph Vargas)\n\nMagic, wonder, science fiction, these are the things that come to mind when I think about Avatar. When this film came out 9 years ago, I had zero doubt it would be a smash hit as there was so much buzz surrounding the film because it was James Cameron’s first movie since Titanic. Avatar took the world by storm at the time, gaining awards acclaim and people hailing it as the next Star Wars. As the film has aged, it has sustained quite a lot of backlash. People hailing it as “unoriginal” or “incredibly predictable”. Be that as it may, this film still holds up to me to this day. Stepping into the world of Pandora is vividly imaginative and awe inspiring. It captures your imagination and just runs wild with it’s groundbreaking visual effects. Is this movie narratively pretty much Dances With Wolves meets Pocahontas? Sure, but those are two great award winning films that most filmmakers would love to be compared to. (Ben Davis)\n\nPixar is the king at making animated movies that entertain the whole family. They have made movies about your Toys, Cars, Monsters, and now Emotions. We’ve seen the premise of what it’s like to have people inside your head in many films, but when Pixar enters the picture they of course put an amazing spin on it! “Inside Out” centers around a chraracter named “Riley” as she adapts to moving for the first time. What makes this so special is the fact that her emotions are seen as living beings inside her head from our perspective. We have “Joy (Amy Poelher), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), and Fear (Bill Hader) who voice the five emotions in her head. A great cast mixed with a great premise, and studio behind it shows you’re in for a ton of laughs and a heartwarming time! (Alex Henderson)\n\nLilo and Stitch is about family. “Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind or forgotten” is probably the most famous line from the movie, and with good reason. This group of characters all come together to form a family because they stick together and care about each other(The Fast Franchise tries to take the “family” theme but Lilo & Stitch do it best). Films like this that demonstrate who you can consider family can be extremely powerful when done well. Stitch might begin as just a pet for Lilo, but by the end, he is her best friend and member of her family, and that is something very special. (Robert Bouffard)\n\nJames Gunn has brought to the world of cinema one of the craziest gang of misfits that has graced the silver screen. An endless stream of charisma and pop hits of the 70’s keeps Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 afloat as it can truly take its time to enjoy the characters that fill out its world. The MCU has been one of the single greatest achievements in film history and Gunn is one of the most unique voices in the mix. The themes of family and relationships help fill out a great character study that is a fresh take on the comic book genre. Yondu, the blue man of this group, is expertly played by Michael Rooker who brings fire and humor to a complex space pirate. Star Lord struggles to find his daddy but this film provides a truly emotionally affecting resolution to that life long search. Yondu is an essential cog in this film and more importantly…he’s Mary Poppins, y’all! (Shane Conto)\n\nWhen The Muppet Movie, the first film in the beloved decades-long Jim Henson franchise, premiered on November of 1979, Roger Ebert wrote: “Jolson sang, Barrymore spoke, Garbo laughed, and now Kermit the Frog rides a bicycle.” So was the talk at the time of release of The Muppet Movie, a film made 3 years after the success of Henson’s Muppet Show skyrocketed him and his green sidekick into stardom. Like Dorothy’s journey from Black and White to Color in the Wizard of Oz back in 1938, Kermit the Frog and friends operating machinery, singing and dancing, and ascending to new heights (quite literally) was the latest display of pure movie magic. No one knew how they did it, but nobody cared, and everyone was in awe of it. And with this awe came the signature Henson humor that pervaded all the Muppet’s exploits; with dry, witty one-liners, inventive slapstick, and self-referential meta jokes that keeps the film fresh in the era of Deadpool. The road trip story gives the film a loose, nostalgic feeling, and the songs, written by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher, rank among some of the most iconic in film history. Yet the beating heart of the story is always the characters created by Henson, so distinct and imaginative, but easy to relate to, they are the outcasts with a dream that make you want to watch and sing along again and again. (Devan Myer)\n\nFinding Nemo is iconic. It brought so many quotes and references to pop culture that will not go away for a long time. But the fact that it has an endearing and forgetful blue fish and a hilarious group of seagulls aren’t the only reason that it’s so great. This movie sends the message that everyone belongs somewhere simply through giving a clownfish a small fin. All the characters Nemo meets throughout his journey to get back to his dad just help him to realize how important he is and that he can meet genuinely nice people who like him because of it. In addition, the sea is the perfect setting for a movie like this. It is a vast and largely unexplored place, and when you’re feeling alone, the world can feel like that sometimes. And that just makes the overall message that much more poignant. (Robert Bouffard)\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nX2\n\nWe are in a time of the superhero genre of film where the Marvel Cinematic Universe rules all. Sometime it is hard to remember back to a time when Marvel films were not always a slam dunk and Spider-Man and X-Men ruled the roost. With Dark Phoenix set to bring the current X-Men\n\nfranchise to a close, we must remember back to a time when this franchise was the pride and joy of Marvel fans. One of the peaks was indeed X2: X-Men United. Bryan Singer brought the X-Men to the big screen in X-Men and followed it up with one of superhero cinema’s greatest sequels and films in general. The deep and rich thematic elements layer this great story that has\n\ngreat action including a killer brawl between Wolverine and Deathstrike. The film opens with one of the coolest scenes in superhero film history; the Oval Office invasion of Nightcrawler. It is important to speak of this great scene as it focuses on Nightcrawler (one of the blue characters of our film for this blurb) as it is visually striking, intense, and one of the most complete realizations of a superhero power ever brought to the screen. The team faces the mounting prejudice against their kind as each member of the X-Men must confront a complex and escalating force. And let’s not forget the sexy and fierce portrayal of Mystique, our other blue character. One for the ages and still one of the great gems of one of cinema’s modern genres.
