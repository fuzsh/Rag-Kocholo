        "text": "Renue Blue™ Face & Hand Serum\n\nRenue Blue Face & Hand Serum works at the cellular level to deliver time-released actives that restore NAD⁺ to improve skin’s texture, firmness, and dermal matrix.\n\nThe epitome of science and performance, Renue Blue Face & Hand Serum works renews cells from within using a proprietary Liposomal Methylene Blue with NAD⁺ Complex (NAD+, NMN, and NR)—science-backed nutrients that provide nourishment on the cellular level.\n\nRenue Blue works at the cellular level to deliver time-released actives that restore NAD⁺ to improve skin’s texture, firmness, and dermal matrix.\n\nNano-sized liposomes penetrate quickly and deeply into dermal layers to deliver a very high concentration of active ingredients that provide unique therapeutic benefits over all other serums.\n\nExpertly formulated with liposomal NAD⁺ Complex (NAD+, NMN, and NR) and Methylene Blue, along with Apocynin, and Glutathione, this potent delivery system offers a deeper penetration of key ingredients into the skin’s surface to combat the most visible signs of aging and promote vibrant, youthful-looking skin.\n\nUse day and night with Renue Blue Face Creme. Suitable for all skin types.\n\nCan be used alone, or as the first step in the 2-part complete Blue Skincare Protocol, before using the Blue Cream for maximum effectiveness.\n\nLIPOSOMAL NAD⁺ COMPLEX\n\nNAD⁺ Complex is a powerful trio, containing NAD⁺, NMN and NR. As you age, your skin requires higher levels of NAD⁺ to combat damage and keep your skin in a youthful and healthy state. Aging is directly associated with lower NAD⁺ levels in the skin. Delivery of NAD⁺ and NAD⁺ boosters through liposomal skincare is the optimal way to safely raise levels of NAD⁺ in the skin.\n\nMETHYLENE BLUE\n\nMethylene Blue has been studied for a wide range of ailments, many of which are aging-related illnesses, and there are currently over 20,000 studies on Pubmed. One study tested the potential dermal anti-aging benefits of four antioxidants, one of which was Methylene Blue.\n\nAmong all of the antioxidants studied, Methylene Blue was by far, the most effective.\n\nApocynin and Glutathione\n\nApocynin and Glutathione work together to protect the skin from oxidative stress and inflammation. Apocynin inhibits NADPH oxidase, reducing free radical production, while Glutathione neutralizes existing free radicals and supports the regeneration of skin cells. Glutathione also regulates melanin synthesis and aids in detoxification, promoting a more even skin tone and a clearer, healthier-looking complexion.\n\nResveratrol\n\nThis grape-derived antioxidant supports skin’s natural defenses against environmental stressors, protects the skin from damage, and promotes youthful gene expression through SIRT1 activation, maintaining skin’s firmness and elasticity.\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid\n\nBy supporting cellular energy production and protecting against oxidative stress, Alpha Lipoic Acid rejuvenates the skin, promotes skin cell renewal, decreases inflammation, and protects mitochondrial energy production for a healthy, evenly toned glow.\n\nHyaluronic Acid\n\nThis humectant maintains skin hydration and volume by holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water. Hyaluronic Acid penetrates deep into the skin, providing long-lasting hydration, supporting skin’s barrier function, and minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nMethylene blue is an antioxidant that can target and neutralize free radicals within cells. It’s unique properties allow it to penetrate the mitochondria, the cell’s powerhouses, where many free radicals are produced. By mitigating free radical accumulation in the mitochondria, methylene blue may help protect cells from damage and promote healthy aging.\n\nRENUE™ - 2 Step Skin Rejuvenation Protocol\n\nRENUE SERUM IS QUICKLY ABSORBED\n\nSerums are made of very small molecules that penetrate your skin faster and more effectively, carrying the active ingredients to deeper layers and into systemic circulation.\n\nStep 1: Apply serum first for penetration to deepest skin layers and systemic circulation.\n\nAllow to soak in for 1-2 minutes.\n\nRENUE LOTION PROTECTS SURFACE LAYER\n\nThe thicker, more emollient ingredients in our Face Creme concentrate more active ingredients in the surface layer.\n\nStep 2: Apply Renue Face Creme for additional nutrient delivery, skin protection, and moisturization.\n\n*note - Renue body lotion can be used alone, as the liposomes will also reach deep layers and systemic circulation, but in lesser quantities than serums. It is more effective to apply the serum first, then the lotion.\n\nWhat's the ideal pH for skin-care products?\n\nYou want to look for skin-care products with a pH of 5.5. If anything, they could be as low as 4.5 and as high as 7. The general rule is slightly acidic is preferred for the best complexion.\n\nWhat pH are Renue™ Products?\n\nRenue™ NAD+ Skincare products are on the optimal 5.5 mark on the pH scale.\n\nHigh pH (8 to 14)\n\nSkin-care products with a high pH level (also known as alkaline) pose the biggest threat to your skin's pH and acid mantle. That tight, squeaky-clean feeling you might experience after washing your face is the truest sign of cleansers with a high pH and damaged skin barrier. They, as well as other alkaline skin-care products, tend to strip away sebum and natural oils.\n\nLow pH (1 to 6)\n\nBecause products with a low pH are at a level closer to skin's natural pH, they will more effectively work with your skin and help cell turnover gently. They're more likely to keep skin bright and smooth, instead of flaky and angry.\n\nHowever, certain products can be too low of a pH for skin and irritate it. At-home peels and other acid-spiked products tend to have a lower pH level, making them great exfoliants but just as stripping as products with a high pH."
