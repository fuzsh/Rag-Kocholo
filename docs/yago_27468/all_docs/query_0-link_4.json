Lou Reed - Egg Cream\n16. Danny Hoch - The Return of Flex\n\nBlue in the Face is a 1995 American comedy film directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster. It stars Harvey Keitel, Victor Argo, Giancarlo Esposito, Roseanne Barr, Michael J. Fox, Lily Tomlin, Mira Sorvino, Lou Reed, Mel Gorham, Jim Jarmusch and Malik Yoba.\r\n\r\nBlue in the Face was filmed over a five-day period as a follow-up to Wang&#39;s 1995 movie Smoke. During production of Smoke, Keitel and the others ad-libbed scenes in-character between takes and a sequel was made using this improvised material.\r\n\r\nLily Tomlin was nominated for an American Comedy Award as &quot;Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture&quot; for her performance in this picture.\r\n\r\nThis is music from the wilds of Brooklyn! Luaka Bop label-head and co-executive producer David Byrne teams up with the late Tejano singer Selena on &quot;God&#39;s Child&quot; and with Indian orchestra leader Vijaya Anand on &quot;Happy Suicide,&quot; songs that, as their titles suggest, feature Byrne&#39;s typically quirky lyrics; Spearhead and Zap Mama perform &quot;To My Ba-Bay!&quot;; the John Lurie National Orchestra declares, &quot;Let&#39;s Get Ready to Rhumba&quot;; Astor Piazzolla contributes &quot;Tango Apasionado,&quot; and Lou Reed previews his upcoming Set the Twilight Reeling album with the nostalgic &quot;Egg Cream.&quot; In and around and through, Danny Hoch, in various guises, contributes spoken-word performances. Who would have thought New York City&#39;s, at that time, least respected borough could be so exotic?",
