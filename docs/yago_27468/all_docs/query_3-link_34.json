        "text": "The Oni, or Ao Oni, is the titular main antagonist of the Ao Oni series. It haunts the mansion that the main character explore, hunting and killing them. It sometimes turns them into Oni themselves.\n\nWARNING: This page may contain spoilers or solutions to puzzles. Read further at your own risk!\n\nAppearance[]\n\nThe Oni is a 11 ft. 7 in. tall, blue/violet creature with a large head. Its face is nearly identical to that of a human, except for its large downwards-projecting nose and two enormous eyes, one bigger than the other. The body seems to have no hands, except for a certain cut-scene in which hands do appear up close.\n\nIts body lacks, for the most part, any defining features. The Oni usually has the same bemused expression on its face. The back of the Oni's head is black, suggesting either dim lighting, or possibly even hair. It has long tusks, and surprisingly, it seems to be able to open its mouth unusually wide - almost half the size of its head, as seen at the very end of the first game.\n\nIn the 2014 movie adaptation, the Oni is given a radical makeover to appear even more monstrous and scary. It now has visible sharp teeth rather than tusks, as well as a more darkish blue skin tone with visible veins and a rougher-looking appearance. The Oni also possesses cat-like eyes that have seemingly have regular vision, rather than the infrared vision it has in the games. In the film, the Oni has a noticeably smaller and thinner left arm and a bulkier right arm. As well as having clawed hands, it also possesses ape-like feet with claws.\n\nFor Ao Oni ver. 2.0, the Oni was given a more purplish tone and smoother skin.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Oni is an enigmatic, mysterious creature that lives in the abandoned mansion on the outskirts of a town in Japan. Not much is known about the Oni, but it lives with many creatures that resemble it, and may have once been a human resident of the mansion. It is known to feed upon people that enter. In Version 6.23, it was shown that after the Oni kills, the victim becomes an Oni themselves. It seems to act like a virus - when the \"virus\" interacts with a sentient creature, it can turn them within moments into a horrific monstrosity, as with the pregnant cat in the original game.\n\nIn the Ao Oni novels, Honoka and her older sister were hiding from Saya, their maid. Honoka’s sister suggested that they should go in the basement, and though Honoka disagreed at first, she relented and they went inside. There they saw a statue of their God, a tree deity that resembles Bat Oni, and then a box full of parasites. In Fragments, Honoka’s sister either accidentally dropped a watering can, soaking the box with water, while in Forever, she accidentally dropped the box itself into a puddle in the basement. In both versions the water activated the parasites, and the girls were infected upon contact with their skin. Honoka and her older sister then poisoned the water tank in their school with the parasites, causing Mari, who ended up drinking from the infected fountain water, to turn into an Oni herself. In Mutation, Hiroshi reads a book where Honoka’s father writes about his search for a cure for Honoka’s sister, who became The Alpha Oni after infection. He locked her up, and while in captivity she would scream that she despised humans. He created 4 clones in an attempt to cure her.\n\nIn the Manga, Naoki accidentally attracted it by doing Messiah’s ritual and stabbing a doll in the chest inside a pentacle. This caused him to get caught by Hiroshi, and the curse backfired on Naoki instead of Takuro.\n\nIn the Jr. novels, a star from 20 years ago fell into earth which was the Oni. Kuro believed it was a gift from the gods, causing him to collect them, and soon, he obtained the power to turn into an Oni whenever he wanted.\n\nConception[]\n\nInterview with noprops on Version 1.1 from Ao-Oni Official Guidebook (pg. 7-9)[1]\n\nQ: How was \"Ao Oni\" born as a character?\n\n\"I made the image of \"Ao Oni\" by myself. After the \"Ao Oni\" character was created, I decided on the title, etc.\"\n\nQ: How long did it take to draw the character? Also, what did you use to draw it?\n\n\"I think about a day. I made it with a software called \"AzPainter.\"\n\nQ: The monster is blue/blueberry colored, were you sure it'd be that color from the beginning?\n\n\"I considered adjusting the color.\"\n\nQ: Did you want it to be a different color?\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\nQ: If you have any alternate color concepts, I would like to see them by all means.\n\n\"There are none left over.\"\n\nQ: How long was the production time?\n\n\"Maybe about a month.\"\n\nQ: There seems to be only one Oni in Ver. 1.1 , is it safe to think it's always the same one?\n\n\"Yes. Various Oni's will appear in Ver. 3, If it was just the same Oni every time the player would get used to it very quickly.\"\n\nChases[]\n\nOne of the main elements of the game is the chase sequences. At certain times, the Oni will appear and head for Hiroshi, following him from room to room. The Oni moves only slightly slower than Hiroshi, making him somewhat easy to outrun. After a set amount of time, the Oni will cease chasing and disappear, only to randomly reappear in an entirely different and unpredictable location in the mansion. In Version 1.1, it takes the longest to outrun him.\n\nCertain chase sequences are scripted chases, meaning they are part of the story, and will inevitably happen during every playthrough of the game. An example of this is when the Oni appears in the library after Hiroshi picks up the key on the table. All other chase sequences are random chases, meaning they are unpredictable and happen in a different order during every playthrough of the game. There are a large number of open doors and closets in the mansion that the Oni has the ability to enter, and the player must constantly be aware of these.\n\nIn Version 6.23, most chases last somewhere between eight and ten seconds. To outrun the Oni, you must evade him until the timer runs out, and then leave the room. You are able to hide in the various wardrobes throughout the house; however, if you use the same one too many times, the Oni will eventually be able to figure out where you are hiding and kill you. It should be noted that at times, the Oni is also able to get the jump on its victims and move at a speed that will result in the player automatically getting a game over. This is only demonstrated across all versions when Hiroshi attempts to pick up the key to the basement without closing the jail cell door. However, a unique example is present in Version 3.0 if the player selects the option to escape alone, which will trigger the Oni and result in a game over.\n\nAo Oni (2014 film)[]\n\nAnna and Shun follow Takuro, Takeshi, and Mika to an abandoned jailhouse on the outskirts of town, where they run into Hiroshi. Takuro is the first to enter the jailhouse, as he is there to place a wooden crate in the basement, and states that no one can follow except Mika, who joins him. Regardless, Hiroshi decides to enter anyway, and is followed by the others.\n\nOnce inside, everyone gets a mysterious phone call. Upon answering, they only hear the tune that plays when the Oni chases the player in the games. Everyone dismisses it and proceed to walk around the building. However, shortly after, Anna discovers that the entrance is now locked.\n\nWhilst exploring with Shun, Takeshi goes into a sudden panic and runs throughout the jailhouse until he decides to hide in a closet, cowering in fear. Hiroshi inspects a broken plate on the ground. He notices a slimy substance covering a shard of the plate as he picks it up.\n\nAfter descending into the basement, Mika notices a crack in the nearby wall and goes to investigate it. As she looks through, she notices her own reflection. A few seconds later, she realizes that she's actually looking into a giant eye, as the lid opens and closes. Startled, Mika runs off in terror and runs into Hiroshi. The two find Takeshi hiding in the closet, but he refuses to move.\n\nStill in the closet, Takeshi hears Takuro calling out to him. Relieved, Takeshi opens the closet door, but he is immediately grasped by the face by a monstrous-looking hand. Takeshi's screams alert everyone except for Takuro, and they all go to investigate. They all see Takeshi get thrown through a door, and though he begs for help, he is dragged back into the room and eaten alive. The others manage to break into the room and find Takeshi's remains strewn across the floor.\n\nMika returns to Takuro and secretly steals the entrance keys from him. She then makes her way to the entrance door to unlock it, but finds that the door still won't open. Mika hears a door opening behind her, and, panicked, she attempts to hide as the Oni slowly comes through. Hiroshi is seen banging on a door calling out to Mika, but she doesn't answer. As Hiroshi gives up, Mika notices the Oni staring right at her before it quickly attacks and kills her. Later on, Shun and Anna are seen further exploring the jailhouse and investigating different rooms until they come across a room with a piano.\n\nShun begins hearing Mika calling out to him from behind a nearby door, but her voice begins getting deeper, and something on the other side of the door begins busting a hole through it. Shun and Anna watch as the Oni looks through the hole in the door it had created. It imitated Mika's cries for help once more before knocking the door down with its belly and fully revealing itself. The Oni then begins chasing after Anna and Shun, but they manage to outrun it and join up with Hiroshi after discovering Mika's remains.\n\nTogether they solve the piano puzzle, and decide to go and find Takuro. As they head down into the basement, Hiroshi is suddenly knocked out by Takuro. It is here that they learn that Takuro had killed Shun earlier on, and had placed his body inside the wooden crate he's been transporting. This reveals that Anna's memories of Shun in the mansion had been a figment of her imagination all along. Anna and Takuro face off, and as Takuro seemingly prepares to attack Anna, he is slaughtered by the Oni, which then begins chasing Anna. As this is happening, she helps the critically injured Hiroshi to walk.\n\nHiroshi decides that he is slowing Anna down and tells her to go on without him. Anna struggles to do so, but the Oni begins gaining on them. The Oni runs Hiroshi over and continues chasing down Anna, who enters a bedroom and closes the door behind her. As the Oni bangs on the door and imitates Hiroshi's voice, Anna begins having flashbacks of talking with Shun, and she eventually opens the door to reveal a bright light. Shun is then seen extending his hand to Anna within the light, telling her to come. Anna takes his hand.\n\nAnna realizes that she is back at the lake, talking to Shun from the beginning of the movie. The two speak before holding hands, indicating that the Oni never existed and everything was normal, or that Anna is hallucinating as she dies.\n\nAo Oni ver. 2.0 (2015 film)[]\n\nWhen the film begins, a couple are seen entering an empty jailhouse, and they begin exploring. The boyfriend is then pulled down a hall by an unseen presence, alerting the girlfriend. As she looks down the hall, something is thrown at her. She then watches as the Oni slowly appears out of the darkness, and it catches and eats her.\n\nAfter entering the supposedly desolate jailhouse, Takuro, Mika, and Takeshi begin exploring the building as Takeshi documents their visit. Takeshi suddenly becomes frightened, and runs off to hide in a closet, which prompts Takuro and Mika to go searching for him. Takuro enters a bedroom and begins searching the closets. He then opens one and finds the Oni, which appears to be sleeping and somehow fits inside the closet. The monster wakes up and sees Takuro, who is then joined by an equally shocked Mika. Takuro then flees, leaving Mika to attempt to follow him.\n\nTakuro successfully gets away, but Mika notices the Oni following her down the stairwell. Mika makes it to the bottom, but she falls over. The creature continues stumbling down the stairs and spots Mika. As the Oni gets closer, Mika closes her eyes and pulls out a screwdriver she recently found in a sink before stabbing the monster, which splatters a blue liquid onto her face. Mika opens her eyes, but is met with the unaffected Oni staring at her. It grins, and proceeds to murder her off-screen.\n\nHiroshi comes to the same stairwell and witnesses the Oni eating Mika, but it turns around and spots him. Hiroshi flees, and successfully outruns the creature, while also becoming injured in the process.\n\nLater on, Takuro makes his way back to the same bedroom where he first saw the Oni and runs into a shirtless, seemingly unstable Takeshi, who has rubbed a blue liquid all over himself. The two have a conversation before Takuro leaves. Takeshi begins laughing maniacally before going back to hiding in a closet.\n\nThe Oni enters the bedroom and begins searching for Takeshi, who sits quietly in the closet. A ghostly figure then appears next to him, which causes Takeshi to panic and rush out of the closet and into the Oni's line of sight. The monster looms over the petrified Takeshi and proceeds to close its mouth around Takeshi's head before clamping its teeth into his neck, killing him.\n\nAs the others make their way into the underground areas of the jailhouse, both Hiroshi and Takuro are chased down a tunnel-like area by the Oni, and they manage to lock themselves in a cell. The Oni grasps the bars of the cell and begins to violently shake it. However, it abruptly stopped, and ominously walked away. This allowed Hiroshi and Takuro to exit the cell and proceed.\n\nAfter solving the jailhouse's final puzzle, Takuro and an injured Hiroshi head for the exit, but Hiroshi feels that he cannot go on due to his injuries. The two come to a hallway, and the Oni murders Hiroshi before setting its sights on Takuro. Takuro runs towards the Oni, which in turn begins running towards Takuro. However, Takuro manages to slide underneath the monster and begins opening the doors to the exit. The Oni turns around as Takuro does this, revealing a bright light. The Oni roars in anger, and the light seemingly causes it to disappear, resetting everything back to the way it was.\n\nAfter the film's end credits, Takeshi is seen standing outside the jailhouse, being confronted by the same ghostly figure from earlier. Takeshi then looks up and sees a gigantic Oni looming over the jailhouse. The monster leans down as Takeshi screams, before seemingly killing him.\n\nAo Oni: The Animation (2017 film)[]\n\nTBA...\n\nEtymology[]\n\nOni (鬼?) are a kind of yōkai from Japanese folklore, variously translated as demons, devils, ogres, or trolls. They are popular characters in Japanese art, literature, and theatre. Depictions of the Oni vary widely, but they usually are shown as hideous, gigantic ogre-like creatures with sharp claws, wild hair, and two horns of various lengths growing from their heads. They are humanoid for the most part, but occasionally, they are shown with unnatural features such as odd numbers of eyes or extra fingers and toes.\n\nTheir skin may be any number of colors, but red and blue are particularly common. They are often depicted wearing tiger-skin loincloths and carrying iron clubs, called kanabō (金棒?). This image leads to the expression \"oni with an iron club\" (oni-ni-kanabō (鬼に金棒?)), that is, to be invincible or undefeatable.\n\nIt can also be used in the sense of \"strong beyond strong,\" or having one's natural quality enhanced or supplemented by the use of some tool.[2] Via the same character used in a Chinese context however, the kanji 鬼 may also translate to a ghost.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
