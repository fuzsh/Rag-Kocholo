        "text": "Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Most of the time, nearly all red blood cells in the arteries carry a full supply of oxygen. These blood cells are bright red and the skin is pinkish or red.\n\nBlood that has lost its oxygen is dark bluish-red. People whose blood is low in oxygen tend to have a bluish color to their skin. This condition is called cyanosis.\n\nDepending on the cause, cyanosis may develop suddenly, along with shortness of breath and other symptoms.\n\nCyanosis that is caused by long-term heart or lung problems may develop slowly. Symptoms may be present, but are often not severe.\n\nWhen the oxygen level has dropped only a small amount, cyanosis may be hard to detect.\n\nIn dark-skinned people, cyanosis may be easier to see in the mucous membranes (lips, gums, around the eyes) and nailbeds.\n\nPeople with cyanosis do not normally have anemia (low blood count). Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.\n\nBluish skin can be a sign of many serious medical problems. Contact or visit your provider.\n\nFor adults, contact your provider or call the local emergency number, such as 911 if you have bluish skin and any of the following:\n\nCannot get a deep breath or your breathing is getting harder, or faster\n\nNeed to lean forward when sitting to breathe\n\nAre using muscles around the ribs to get enough air\n\nHave chest pain\n\nAre having headaches more often than usual\n\nFeel sleepy or confused\n\nHave a fever\n\nAre coughing up dark mucus\n\nAre unable to speak a full sentence because of shortness of breath\n\nFor children, contact your provider or call 911 or the local emergency number if your child has bluish skin and any of the following:\n\nHard time breathing\n\nMoving chest muscles in with each breath\n\nBreathing faster than 50 to 60 breaths per minute (when not crying)\n\nMaking a grunting noise\n\nSitting with shoulders hunched over\n\nIs very tired\n\nMoving very little\n\nHas a limp or floppy body\n\nNostrils flare out when breathing\n\nDoes not feel like eating\n\nIs irritable\n\nHas trouble sleeping\n\nIn general, cyanosis that occurs acutely is more likely to be an emergency than when it is present for a long time."
