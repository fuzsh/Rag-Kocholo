        "text": "Here is also a list of Errors in Braveheart, but the painted blue faces are not entirely inaccurate, it's just it was not used for battle and out of practice by the time of Wallace, as the idea of it may stem Pict Tradition.\n\nError #4: The Scots didn’t paint their faces for battle\n\nAt least they no longer did by the time of Wallace. What Gibson was obviously alluding to is the Scottish Picts’ tradition of painting their faces blue to scare off those pansies, the Romans, from their lands. Of course, Emperor Adrian would have nothing of it and built a wall to keep those evil buggers from sacking the rest of Britain while the sandal-folk still ruled the scene.\n\nThe blue face-paint is so iconic, though, you couldn’t imagine BraveHeart without it. These days of course the tradition is to paint the flag of Scotland (a white X across with blue sides) for sporting events.\n\nhttps://thehande.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/braveheart-the-10-historical-inaccuracies-you-need-to-know-before-watching-the-movie/\n\nQ: Why do they wear blue or blue and white makeup?\n\nIf you didn’t know, these are the Scottish colors. You can see them on Scotland’s flag.\n\nQ: What is that paint?\n\nIt’s called woad. It’s a plant and the blue dye is produced from the leaves.\n\nQ: Did Braveheart really wear that paint into battle?\n\nProbably not. Most historians think the paint was an earlier phenomenon (Wikipedia has a lengthy section on historical inaccuracies in the film). We also like the nit-picking produced on this blog’s Braveheart tag.\n\nhttps://triviahappy.com/articles/5-questions-about-scottish-face-makeup-as-seen-in-braveheart\n\nHistory of Picts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts\n\nTo the gentleman who had trouble finding Celtic symbology among the runes, perhaps that is because runes are Nordic, not Celtic. The Celts had the Ogham Alphabet that was likely used for divination as well as an alphabet and a nemonic device for students, but the woad paint was more likely to reflect the natural world's shapes and images. Braveheart is indeed an inaccurate depiction of the Celts. The two pictures above show woad painted on in straight lines dividing a face in two, and in the form of a cross. The non-Christianized, non-Romanized Celts in any age were not a linear people, and even when the church later forced their cross imagery on them, they added a circle to the cross to represent the old culture. Their symbology came from nature: circles, spirals, trees, the salmon. Not straight lines, and not binary divisions of the face. This is one of thousands of examples of our current Romanized Christian cosmology trying to depict an ancient, animist, egalitarian, ecocentric, non-binary culture and failing miserably."
