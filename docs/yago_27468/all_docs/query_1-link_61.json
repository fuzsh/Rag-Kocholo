Get excited to drop, push, and stretch your drawings together before turning them into your own paper building block. This hands-on activity will be facilitated by Heard Museum Engagement & Learning Programs staff and is included with regular admission.\n\nWe’ll be located in the Lyon Family Crossroads gallery, making it easy to step through Art & Sole on your way to the Heardlings Art Cart.\n\nAll About the Heardlings Art Cart\n\nThe Heardlings Art Cart is your hub for resources and activities for families visiting the Heard Museum. On a daily basis, the cart will be just past the Admissions desk. Here, children and their caregivers can get oriented and pick up materials designed just for them, including a Family Map and Kids Activity Guide. The Heardlings Art Cart is also the place to look for exhibition-specific guides for families.\n\nOn scheduled dates – including Wednesday, June 26, the Heardlings Art Cart will host hands-on activities relating to current exhibitions. These activities are free for Members and included with regular admission.\n\nWhat are Heardlings?"
