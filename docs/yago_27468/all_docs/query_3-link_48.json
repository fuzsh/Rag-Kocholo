Wolf\n\nSomeone Named Eva is another World War II story, this time from the perspective of a Czech Catholic girl who gets separated from her family during the Nazi occupation. Milada (Eva) is taken to a German training center to be reconditioned to become part of the “New Germany” and receives a new name and Nazi family. Throughout the hardships of war, Milada learns that holding on to her true identity is the most difficult task she’s ever experienced. While many stories surrounding Nazi Germany are told through the perspective of Jewish people, this fictional account looks at the effects of Germanization on children and can spark discussions on identity and family.\n\nSadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes by Eleanor Coerr\n\nLike Someone Named Eva, Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes is another example of a lesser-known perspective of World War II.
