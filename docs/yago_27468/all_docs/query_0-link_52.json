Also here is material related to the National Public Radio broadcast of The National Story Project. The stories submitted for this project were later collected in I Thought My Father Was God, edited by Auster, and also documented here. Additional material includes drafts of four plays, material related to the composition of two poetry monographs, material related to several works of translation, and a baseball game Auster invented. Material written by others, including creative adaptations and scholarly analysis of his work, is also included here.\n\nThe archive also contains significant incoming and outgoing correspondence, and includes letters to and from writers and friends; agents and publishers; translators, readers, students and organizations."
