        "text": "I absolutely love the Shazam app! It has become my go-to music discovery companion. Whether I'm at a party, watching a movie, or listening to the radio, Shazam never fails to identify any song playing in the background. The app is incredibly fast and accurate, instantly providing me with all the details I need, including the song title, artist, and even lyrics. I appreciate the seamless integration with other music streaming platforms, allowing me to easily add my newfound favorites to my playlists. The user-friendly interface and intuitive design make navigating through the app a breeze. Furthermore, the personalized recommendations feature has introduced me to countless amazing artists and songs that I may have otherwise missed out on. Shazam has truly revolutionized how I discover and enjoy music, and I highly recommend it to all music enthusiasts out there!\n\nIâve seen plenty of overwhelmingly positive reviews for Shazam and after using it for only a short period of time I can see how useful the app can be. On multiple occasions a random catchy song has come on the radio that I want to add to my playlist, and Shazam is there to help. Even when the song is really quiet, Shazam can still pick it up. I could barely hear a song playing once and yet Shazam knew exactly which song it was. I would definitely recommend to others, especially since itâs free.\n\nMy one problem with Shazam is that a lot of the time Iâll hear a song come on that I love and before I can grab my phone to Shazam it, itâs gone. So now what do I do. Shazam has forced me to get another app as well because I canât find a song by humming or singing it since Shazam needs to hear the actual song playing. This is a shame since Iâm really liking the app. If the developers could perhaps add a feature that allows me to hum or sing a song and have it found by Shazam, that would be awesome. Even Google now has this feature, and from such a great app like Shazam I kind of expect the same.\n\nOverall a very useful app, and if this change happens I will absolutely edit my review to five stars. Developers, Iâm counting on you."
