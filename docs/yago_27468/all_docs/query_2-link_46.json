I have been using it twice a day everyday for weeks and I'm only halfway through my bottle, absolutely love the stuff!\n\nI'm already so in love with your magical oil! I've been using it the past two nights and I can already see a difference, which is absolutely crazy!!\n\nThank you so much for providing such a life changing product.\n\nI'm so in love with it. It's only been 4 days & honestly it has made a difference - I'm literally so thankful and grateful I found your page!! I've been feeling very low vibe lately & doing a beauty ritual with oil, gua sha and roller has lifted my energy and I look forward to it everyday. I feel more motivated and happier!!\n\nThe Moringa Oleifera tree is rich in over 46 Antioxidants, 92 Nutrients, 36 Nourishing Compounds, and over 20 Amino Acids.\n\nCold-pressing her seeds produces a nutrient rich oil that retains a vast amount of all that miraculous goodness.\n\n“If you feel lost, disappointed, hesitant, or weak, return to yourself, to who you are, here and now and when you get there, you will discover yourself, like a lotus flower in full bloom, even in a muddy pond, beautiful and strong.”\n\n― Masaru Emoto: Secret Life of Water\n\nRitual Oils are developed for all skin types and used daily by men, women and children of all ages, from all over the world.\n\nApply to the face, hair & body to nourish the senses and rejuvenate the appearance of your hair and skin from head to toe.\n\nTake a moment to drop into yourself.\n\nDispense half of the loaded dropper onto the palm of your hand and begin to rub your hands together.\n\nInhale deeply the pleasant scent of the Blue Lotus, allowing it to activate your senses, purifying your aura and bringing you back to center.\n\nClose the eyes and proceed to lather into your face, neck and body, bringing your awareness to the surface of the skin, as you whisper sweet nothings to yourself and choose to consciously send love into your body through the pores of your skin.\n\nFor best results, apply morning and night to clean damp skin after washing your face or having a shower and use in conjunction with Rose Quartz Face Roller and Gua Sha tools.\n\n*For topical use only."
