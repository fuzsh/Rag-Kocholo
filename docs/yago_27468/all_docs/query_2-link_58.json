        "text": "The Blue Fugates of Troublesome Creek was an entire family from Eastern Kentucky made up of blue-skinned people. Those who knew the Fugates described them as, “blue all over” and “as blue as Lake Louise.”\n\nThe Blue Fugates were famously known for inheriting and passing on the rare gene that causes methemoglobinemia, a blood disorder that produces an abnormally high amount of methemoglobin (a form of hemoglobin). Individuals who have this disease are at risk of developing very dark, almost chocolate- colored blood or blue skin. This is because the hemoglobin that they produce is unable to carry sufficient amounts of oxygen throughout the body and oxygenate tissues.\n\nMethemoglobinemia can be inherited or acquired. Acquired cases are more likely to occur and are usually the result of exposure to certain medications or chemicals such as nitrates, silver or benzocaine.\n\nSymptoms of this rare disease can include:\n\nBluish colored skin\n\nSeizures\n\nHeadaches\n\nShortness of breath\n\nFatigue\n\nAnother disorder that is known to cause the skin to turn to a bluish or silver hue is argyria. This condition results from extended amounts of contact with silver compounds or the ingestion of silver salts.\n\nPeople who are potentially at risk of developing this condition are those:\n\nTaking medications with silver salts as an ingredient\n\nTaking colloidal silver as a dietary supplement\n\nHave careers that expose them to silver such as silver mining or refining\n\nCases of this disorder are extremely rare. Paul Karason famously known as “Papa Smurf,” was one of these few people to develop argryia in recent years. He acquired the disorder by drinking a home-made brew that included colloidal silver and using a silver-based salve on his face. He helped raise awareness of this condition as well as the potentially harmful side effects of ingesting silver-based products.\n\nHere is a video of the interview of “The man who turned blue”.\n\n(Video via OWN network)"
