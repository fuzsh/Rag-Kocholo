        "text": "TL:DR\n\nNo you cannot.\n\nCards and effects cannot be activated unless they are common knowledge. This means any face-up card on the field or in the graveyard (noted as GY on more recent cards), however cards in hand card be activated as well but these say you either need to discard the card (like Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring) or reveal it to your opponent (like Trickstar Lycoris).\n\nSo as Maiden is not common knowledge while face down so the effect cannot be activated as it \"misses timing\" which I will explain a bit more on.\n\nThis next part is a bit more general so I will use generic examples.\n\nDuring the battle phase there is something known as the Battle step during this there are multiple sub-steps;\n\nAttack Declaration\n\nDamage Step\n\nDamage Calculation\n\nAttack Declaration This step is kind of self explanatory to what it means, it is the point in which the turn player declares their attack on a monster, at this point you can respond with certain cards like Mirror Force which has a specific activation requirement of an attack declaration.\n\nWhen an opponent's monster declares an attack: Destroy all monsters your opponent's attack position monsters.\n\nNote: any other traps/quick-play spells/monsters using quick effects can still be activated at this point providing it is a legal play.\n\nDamage Step: The damage step works slightly differently so bare with me if I am not clear. The damage step begins when both players have agreed to proceed after attack declaration, to put it simply at this point you can only activate Attack/Defense modifiers or cards that negate activations however other things can be activated too which I will get on to soon.\n\nAttack modifier example Rush Recklessly\n\nTarget 1 face-up monster on the field; it gains 700 ATK until the end of this turn.\n\nNegate activation example Solemn Judgement\n\nWhen a monster would be Summoned, OR a Spell/Trap card is activated: Pay half your Life Points; negate the Summon or activation, and if you do, destroy that card.\n\nNotice how it says activations.\n\nDamage Calculation This happens when both players have finished activating any cards in the damage step before the attack goes through so at this point is when the attack actually takes place and damage is dealt(if any), however this is still part of the damage step.\n\nEarlier how I said other cards can be activated in the damage step, this is this point, these effects are cards that trigger if they are destroyed by battle (something like Sangan) or if it destroys something by battle (something like Sky Striker Mecharmory - Hercules Base) these still count as triggering in the damage step so cards like Ash blossom (which I mentioned earlier) cannot be activated in response as Ash negates effects not activations but however Solemn Judgement can be activated in response to these."
