        "text": "There’s a mantra I kind of use.\n\nI think it is attributed to Stephen King who says, “Don’t get it right (air quotes right), get it written.”\n\nHere is another thing. Don’t get it formatted, get it written. Work on formatting your document afterwards.\n\nIt’s a little tough if you come from the old typewriter age, or if you are a kid, I know, because I have a couple of teenagers. As soon as they click this thing, and they look at fonts they’re gone for five minutes, right?\n\nBut what I am going to show you is the advantages of doing that.\n\nSo, here we have an unformatted document about the Solar system.\n\nHere’s what I would normally do if I didn’t know about styles.\n\nI might take my title here and okay I want to center that.\n\nOkay, I’ll make it big. I don’t know how big.\n\nI guess that looks good.\n\nHere is my author thing and I am going to try to center that, and I’ll make a little smaller, I guess.\n\nOkay, now, I have all these headings.\n\nWhat should I do for a heading? Well, let’s make it a color.\n\nI like colors.\n\nSo let’s kind of I don’t know about that.\n\nLet’s make that a little bigger.\n\nI don’t know...16 point font, maybe. Maybe?\n\nOh some spacing.\n\nI could do a carriage return.\n\nCarriage returns are bad, especially if you’re continuing typing because now you’re in that font.\n\nThat’s bad.\n\nSo let’s get away from the carriage return and maybe you know about, ooh, spacing.\n\nIf you go up to the paragraph in the ribbon here in this little triangle on the bottom right-hand corner, that will open your Paragraph settings.\n\nAnd after I am going to put a little six point. Sure. I don’t know what that is. Sure.\n\nOkay, that gives it a little spacing.\n\nNow if I have to do this for each of my headings, I know about Format Painter, so I can take this format, go over up here to Format Painter in the ribbon, click on that and now everything I touch will be painted like that.\n\nOops. So that’s cool.\n\nI can do that.\n\nBut if I am doing that for a lot of headings, I have to go through my entire document.\n\nThat can be kind of troublesome.\n\nI can do all those steps: change font, change spacing, change color with headings.\n\nI am going to go up here to the Quick Styles, which is up here in the ribbon.\n\nThe Planets here, I’m going to hit Heading 1 and it has just given me some spacing.\n\nIt has changed the font.\n\nIt has changed the color.\n\nKind of just what I did there with three steps, I can do with styles.\n\nSo let me click Asteroids and hit Heading 1 again.\n\nSo I can go through my document this way.\n\nNow The Planets, that’s going to be a different heading, so I can do Heading 2 and I don’t have to worry about well it’s 16 point font for Heading 1, what should...\n\nShould this be 14 point font? Should it be a different color? I don’t have to worry about that.\n\nI can just go through my document and choose the heading.\n\nSo here’s a planet. That’s going to be...\n\nOops I hit something on the ribbon here.Heading 2. The Earth is Heading 2. Now the moons that will be another part. That’s going to be Heading 3. So you got the idea here. So Mars is Heading 2."
