        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAn array of New Yorkers become involved with a mom-and-pop cigar shop in Brooklyn in an acclaimed short story, presented here along with interviews with the author and the film's actors and a description of the process of creating a film. Original. Movie tie-in.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nPaul Auster is the bestselling author of Winter Journal, Sunset Park, Man in the Dark, The Brooklyn Follies, The Book of Illusions and The New York Trilogy, among many other works. In 2006 he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize for Literature and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his other honours are the Independent Spirit Award for the screenplay of Smoke and the Prix Medicis Etranger for Leviathan. He has also been shortlisted for both the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award (The Book of Illusions) and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction (The Music of Chance). His work has been translated into more than forty languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nReview\n\nThese two films present some unusual scenarios, providing storyteller protagonists who provide strong views of human behavior and who consider the meaning behind their lives and encounters. This is a fine example of how stories get translated to film, including insights on actor/director collaborations. -- Midwest Book Review"
