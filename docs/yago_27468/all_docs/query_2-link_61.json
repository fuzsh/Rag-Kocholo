        "text": "Hi,\n\nFaces have 2 sides: The ‘white’ side is the front, and the ‘grayish blue’ side is the back.\n\n[…and you can change the default color of these sides in the edit styles menu if you wanted to].\n\nHaving said that, you could be looking at a Reversed Face, or a Missing Face, or likely both based on your description.\n\nTo fix a Reversed Face: use the ‘Reverse Face’ command […available on the context menu which appears after you Right Click while hovering over a face you which to change]. . . In using that SketchUp will flip the face orientation around each time you invoke the command.\n\nAnd for regenerating a missing face the typical trick is to draw a new line between two end points that already exist on the plane of the missing face. Doing so causes SketchUp to fill in the face again on that plane.\n\n–\n\nSometimes missing faces exist because your edges don’t fall upon the same plane. in that case you have a non-coplanar relationship between the edges, and in that situation you need to resort towards triangulation between the various endpoints in an effort to fill them in.\n\nOR, this symptom of non-coplanar edges is really a problem of imprecise modeling – where lines that should exist on a common plane don’t for whatever reason… In this case the solution is to reestablish the coplanar relationship between edges and endpoints. (and this probably involves rotating the model around and taking a closer look at where the fault lies – and finding what got moved out of position].\n\nSometimes faces get deleted accidentally because when you make a selection the bounding box used also selects geometry from the back side of the model as well. consequently whatever modifications you make to that selection affect the entire selection group, and things disappear. This is easy to miss if you’re not rotating the model around to check for such things.\n\n–\n\nIf the blue you’re referring to is a brighter blue, then that could be associated with the Blue Box which appears around objects that have been grouped, or turned into components.\n\nIf that’s the case then you’ll have to go into the groups/components edit mode in order to make any changes… which happens by double clicking on the group/component.\n\nIt would be nice to see the real SketchUp model, just in case there’s some else going on.\n\nOtherwise, I hope this helps you for what it is.\n\nTake Care,\n\nJim\n\nAll of the ‘blue’ faces are orientated ‘backwards’.\n\nWhile this presents few issues in pure SketchUp modeling [except in pushpull face retention etc], it is bad practice.\n\nAlmost all Rendering programs will fail as they render the front and ignore the back.\n\nAlso 3d-printers can fail too, because although the object might seem ‘solid’ the exported STL file etc might contain anomalies that will ruin the print.\n\nThe ‘reversed faces’ are easily resolved.\n\nSelect a problem face [or faces] and use the context-menu ‘Reverse…’\n\nYou can make a shortcut to it in Preferences if you have a face selected when you open the Preferences dialog and filer ‘reverse’.\n\nThat makes it faster.\n\nIf the face is inside a group, then edit the group so you can select the face.\n\nIf you have an object that is totally reversed, select-all then ‘reverse-faces’.\n\nIf just some of its faces are reversed you can try this…\n\nSelect a face that is oriented the right way.\n\nContext-menu > Orient…\n\nAll connected faces flip to match the selected face’s orientation.\n\nNote that this works if the object is a ‘solid’ or it at least has no edges with more than two faces - otherwise SketchUp won’t be able to properly orient all connected faces, because at least one will be reversed relative to its neighbors…"
