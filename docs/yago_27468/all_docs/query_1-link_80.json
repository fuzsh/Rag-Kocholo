        "text": "Vaseline is safe for most people to apply to their face as a moisturizer. But, it may also increase the risk of skin irritation and acne in those prone to these symptoms.\n\nVaseline is a common brand name for petroleum jelly. It is an inexpensive skin care product that is available in most drugstores. Various formulations of petroleum jelly are available, but the manufacturers of Vaseline take steps to purify their product.\n\nIn this article, we outline some of the possible benefits and risks of applying Vaseline to the face. We also suggest some uses of Vaseline and provide tips on how to apply it to the face.\n\nVaseline is a moisturizing product that is safe for most people to put on their face.\n\nPeople can apply Vaseline to help with short-term skin concerns, such as temporary skin dryness or irritation. Vaseline is also suitable as a long-term moisturizer.\n\nBelow, we discuss some of the benefits of using Vaseline on the face.\n\nMoisturizing\n\nPetroleum jelly is an oil-based product that forms an oily film over the surface of the skin. This oily film seals in moisture, helping keep skin hydrated and soft.\n\nAccording to a 2016 review article, Vaseline prevents more than 98% of water loss from the outer layer of the skin. This type of water loss is known as transepidermal water loss (TEWL).\n\nIn comparison, similar oil-based moisturizers, such as mineral oil and lanolin, reduce TEWL by about 20–30%.\n\nCreating a physical barrier\n\nThe same oily film that seals in moisture also creates a physical barrier on the skin. This barrier protects against harsh elements and environmental pollutants that can damage the skin.\n\nWhile Vaseline is typically safe to use on the face, it may not be suitable for everyone. Below are some potential risks of using Vaseline on the face.\n\nIncreased breakouts\n\nWhile Vaseline helps seal moisture into the skin, some experts have suggested that it may also trap in oil and dirt. As such, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) warn that people who are prone to acne may experience breakouts after applying Vaseline to the face.\n\nHowever, according to Vaseline’s company website, Vaseline is noncomedogenic, meaning that it will not clog or block pores.\n\nNonetheless, people who have oily or acne-prone skin may not like the greasy feeling that Vaseline leaves on the skin.\n\nSkin irritation\n\nAccording to a 2016 review, there are no reports of people experiencing a severe allergic reaction to Vaseline. Less severe allergic skin reactions are also rare.\n\nHowever, anyone who develops any of the following symptoms after applying Vaseline should stop using the product:\n\nskin redness or soreness\n\nitching\n\nswelling or inflammation\n\nAccording to the AAD, it is best to apply Vaseline to slightly damp skin. As such, the best time to apply it is after having a shower or washing the face.\n\nPeople typically apply Vaseline using their fingertips. Before applying the product, a person should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water to avoid introducing any bacteria onto the facial skin.\n\nA person can then apply a thin layer of Vaseline to dry areas of the skin, taking caring to avoid the mucous membranes of the eyes.\n\nVaseline has many potential uses as a skin care product, including those below:\n\nSoothing dry skin\n\nThe AAD recommend applying Vaseline to parts of the face that are prone to dryness, such as the lips and eyelids. They suggest applying a small amount of Vaseline to slightly damp skin to help seal in moisture.\n\nAlleviating itching\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a skin condition that causes patches of dry, flaky, and itchy skin.\n\nDermatologists often recommend petroleum jelly and similar ointments as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. These ointments seal in moisture, thereby reducing the skin dryness and flakiness that contribute to itching.\n\nAssisting wound healing\n\nAccording to the AAD, petroleum jelly may aid in the healing of minor wounds, such as cuts, scrapes, and scratches. The petroleum jelly locks in moisture, preventing the wound dryness and scabbing that ordinarily prolong wound healing.\n\nBy speeding up wound healing, petroleum jelly may also prevent the formation of large, deep, or itchy scars.\n\nSealing in other skin treatments\n\nA person can apply serums or other active ingredients to their skin before applying Vaseline as a moisturizer. The Vaseline will help seal in the other skin care products, allowing them more time to work on the skin.\n\nCosmetic uses\n\nSome people apply Vaseline to the apples of the cheeks as an alternative to blush or highlighter.\n\nSeveral different moisturizing ingredients are suitable for use on the face. They typically fall into one of three categories: occlusives, emollients, and humectants.\n\nOften, the manufacturers of skin care products will combine more than one type of moisturizer to enhance the moisturizing ability of the product.\n\nBelow are the three different types of moisturizers, along with some examples.\n\nOcclusives\n\nOcclusives, such as petroleum jelly, create a barrier over the skin, helping prevent water loss.\n\nTwo other common occlusive moisturizers are lanolin and mineral oil. However, a 2016 review notes that these ingredients may have a higher tendency to cause allergic reactions.\n\nEmollients\n\nEmollients are oils and high fat compounds that soften and smooth the skin.\n\nSome examples of emollient moisturizers include:\n\nplant oils, such as grapeseed, sesame seed, and jojoba\n\nnut butters, which include cocoa butter and shea butter\n\nsqualene\n\nHumectants\n\nHumectants are ingredients that bond with water molecules, thereby attracting water into the skin.\n\nTwo common humectant moisturizers are glycerin and hyaluronic acid."
