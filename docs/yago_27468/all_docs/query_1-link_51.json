        "text": "Avatar is fast becoming the celluloid equivalent of one of those spectacularly catchy three-minute pop songs, the kind which once felt like the freshest, most gorgeously intense musical rush but which six months later have been so overplayed that the opening chords cause normally sane folk to smash their radios into tiny pieces and run screaming from the room.\n\nI saw the film three times at the cinema last year – once at a press screening, once at the Imax in London's Waterloo and over Christmas with my family at a cinema with an appallingly dark screen. Each time, I found myself marvelling at James Cameron's technical achievement and easily ignoring the film's often trite storyline. That Avatar merely retrod territory we've seen on the big screen a thousand times before hardly mattered given the visual ambition and the pitch-perfect performances.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, viewing the new special edition this week – featuring an additional nine minutes of footage released to tempt cinemagoers back to Pandora – hasn't made a huge amount of difference to my opinion of the film, but I can say that the gloss is rather wearing off my initial fondness. Now almost three hours long, Avatar is as spectacular as ever, and the 3D work remains the best yet seen in what remains a pretty fickle field. Inevitably, as always happens when re-watching a favourite movie, there is the odd moment of surprise when a nuance of detail that one had not picked up before becomes apparent. But there's not much here to delight anyone who did not adore the film the first time around, a mere ... ooh ... nine months or so ago.\n\nOf the new footage, the much-trumpeted \"Pandoran porn\" sequence – in which we finally get to see some Na'vi nookie – is hardly worth the editing time, while a new death scene for tribal chieftain Tsu'tey (yes, he just about survived that fall from the human jet after being machine-gunned down) is so tonally weird it's obvious why it never made the cut. There's a little more of Grace's school, and an extra hunting scene in which Jake et al chase down a herd of cow-like creatures. But, as always seems to be the case with these things, the \"good stuff\" all went into the original movie.\n\nThere is nothing in the additional scenes to compare to any of the film's standout moments: Jake's hapless first sojourn in the Pandoran jungle, his thrilling landing at the Tree of Souls after taming the Toruk or the final Aliens-aping face-off with Quaritch. I'm pretty certain the original cut will remain the movie that people watch in a decade's time – probably on their own home 3D TVs, which by then you won't even need glasses to view."
