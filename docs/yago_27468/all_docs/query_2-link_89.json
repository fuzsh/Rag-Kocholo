        "text": "The majority of fish on our website will NOT look like their photos upon their unboxing. Fish change in appearance depending on many factors, including mood, age, gender, and social status. Fish will naturally lose color during shipping and may appear faded upon arrival. Pictures are used as examples only. Pictures may be of mature fish with full color or juvenile fish without color. We encourage you to research the species as much as possible prior to ordering in order to familiarize yourself with the various appearances they may take on. Many species have females that look drastically different to their male counterparts, and many juveniles will not have as much color (or different colors) as their adult forms. If you have questions about how the fish will look, please review their information and email us if you have any questions.\n\nWe provide premium next day air shipping at affordable flat rates to minimize transit time for the health of the fish.\n\nUS East UPS Next Day Air $39.99 US Central UPS Next Day Air $49.99 US West UPS Next Day Air $59.99 Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska UPS 1-2 Day Air Starts at $89.99 Canada UPS 1-2 Day Air Starts at $89.99 Florida UPS Next Day Ground $19.99 Local pickup Select at checkout No charge No overseas shipping\n\nMinimum order for all shipping is $50 for mainland US, $100 elsewhere.
