        "text": "The baby takes on a bluish hue because of poorly oxygenated blood. Normally, blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen. The blood is circulated back through the heart and then throughout the body.\n\nWhen there’s a problem with the heart, lungs, or blood, blood may not be oxygenated properly. This causes the skin to take on a blue color. The lack of oxygenation can occur for several reasons.\n\nTetralogy of Fallot (TOF)\n\nWhile a rare congenital heart defect, TOF is a primary cause of blue baby syndrome. It’s actually a combination of four heart defects that can reduce blood flow to the lungs and allow oxygen-poor blood to flow out into the body.\n\nTOF includes conditions like having a hole in the wall that separates the left and right ventricles of the heart and a muscle obstructing the flow of blood from the right ventricle into the pulmonary, or lung, artery.\n\nMethemoglobinemia\n\nThis condition stems from nitrate poisoning. It is can happen in babies who are fed infant formula mixed with well water or homemade baby food made with nitrate-rich foods, like spinach or beets.\n\nThe condition occurs most often in babies under 6 months of age. When this young, babies have more sensitive and underdeveloped gastrointestinal tracts, which are more likely to convert nitrate into nitrite. As nitrite circulates in the body, it produces methemoglobin. While methemoglobin is oxygen-rich, it doesn’t release that oxygen into the bloodstream. This gives babies with the condition their bluish hue.\n\nMethemoglobinemia can also rarely be congenital.\n\nOther congenital heart defects\n\nGenetics cause most congenital heart defects. For example, babies born with Down syndrome often have heart problems.\n\nIssues with maternal health, such as underlying and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, can also result in a baby developing heart defects.\n\nSome heart defects are also caused for no apparent reason at all. Only a few congenital heart defects cause cyanosis."
