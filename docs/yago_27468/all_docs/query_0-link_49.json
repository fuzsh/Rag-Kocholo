        "text": "Paul Auster was born on February 3, 1947, in Newark, New Jersey. He received a B.A. and a M.A. in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University. In addition to his career as a writer, Auster has been a census taker, tutor, merchant seaman, little-league baseball coach, and a telephone operator. He started his writing career as a translator. He soon gained popularity for the detective novels that make up his New York Trilogy. His other works include The Invention of Solitude; Leviathan; Moon Palace; Facing the Music; In the Country of Last Things; The Music of Chance; Mr. Vertigo; and The Brooklyn Follies. His latest novels are entitled, Invisible and Sunset Park. In addition… to his novels, Auster has written screenplays and directed several films. He is the recipient of a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a French Prix Medicis for Foreign Literature.\n\nDr. Wayne L. Wang has been an independent researcher on Tao philosophy since 1999. He is an engineer-scientist by training. He became interested in Tao philosophy because the Tao Te Ching has been treated as a mysterious philosophy, but shows some similarities to modern scientific phenomena. His first analysis was published as The Dynamic Tao and its Manifestations (2004). He has since devoted his time in further clarification of the principle of Tao philosophy. He has surveyed and consolidated many ancient and modern philosophies and formulated a consistent logic model for Tao philosophy.He has published a paper, The Basic Theory of Tao Philosophy (2006), which shows an initial scientific… model that reflects the Tai-ji relationship in Tao. After having consolidated the logic in Tao with many other philosophies, ancient and modern, east and west, he published the complete logic structure of Tao Philosophy in a Chinese article named The Logic of Tao Philosophy (2012). He is the first one in history to claim a complete hermeneutics of the first Chapter of the Tao Te Ching. His model and applications are summarized in two books: The Logic of Tao Philosophy (2013) and Tao Te Ching: An Ultimate Translation (2013). These works represent a major milestone in his search for the foundation of Tao philosophy. It makes a logical and self-consistent translation possible. He continues to show more applications of the Principle of Oneness in comparative philosophy, psychology, and religions. In 2014, he publishes \"Searching for the Meaning of Life (Chinese Version).\"He holds a Ph. D. degree from M. I. T. and resides near Chicago, Illinois, USA.
