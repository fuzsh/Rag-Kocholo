        "text": "If your young child reacts to sudden pain or upset by not breathing, turning blue or pale, and then fainting, theyÂ may have just had a breath-holding spell.\n\nWhen this happens, it can be scary and can cause a parent to worry. Also called breath-holding attacks, these spells are somewhat common and can happen in healthy children. They can look like seizures, but theyâre not. The spells donât hurt the children, and many outgrow them by age 4 but can continue until they are about 8. They are most common in 2-year-olds.\n\nBreath-holding spells come in two types. With cyanotic spells, a childâs face turns blue. With pallid spells, theyÂ becomeÂ pale. Cyanotic spells are more common.\n\nCauses\n\nOften, a breath-holding attack starts with crying in reaction to pain, fear, or anger.\n\nIf your child has a cyanotic spell, they'reÂ probably upset or frustrated about something. Maybe theyÂ got into trouble or wanted something theyÂ couldnât have. Theyâll cry, exhale very hard, but not breathe in again. TheirÂ face, especially around theirÂ lips, quickly will turn blue, and theyâll pass out.\n\nWith a pallid spell, they likely felt a sudden pain or scare. They may have fallen backward and bumped theirÂ head or been spooked when someone snuck up behind them. TheyÂ may shout in hurt or surprise, or theyÂ may open theirÂ mouth to shout but no sounds come out. Theyâll then stop breathing, the color will drain from theirÂ face, and theyâll be out.\n\nIn both cases, your child will start to breathe again within a minute and come to on theirÂ own. TheyÂ may be tired, but other than that, theyâll be theirÂ normal self.\n\nYour child doesnât have these spells on purpose. Itâs theirÂ bodyâs involuntary response to a sudden event. The reflexes change your childâs breathing pattern, heart rate, and blood pressure levels, which make your child faint.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAfter your childâs first breath-holding spell, take themÂ to theirÂ doctor to rule out any health problems.\n\nThere are no tests to confirm a breath-holding spell. Your pediatrician usually can diagnose it after hearing what happened. Theyâll want to know what set it off, how your child looked, and how theyÂ started to breathe again.\n\nRarely, the pediatrician may refer your child to a heart doctor, called a cardiologist, or to a neurologist, who specializes in the brain and the nervous system, to check for any underlying causes.\n\nTreatment\n\nIf your child has one breath-holding spell, theyâll likely have more. Some children have them several times a day, while others may have just one in a year.\n\nThere are no drugs or other treatments for these spells. Some studies suggest that anemia, or low levels of red blood cells, may be a culprit and that iron supplements may help. But more research is needed. Your doctor may order blood work to determine iron levels.\n\nThe best thing to do is let your child lie on theirÂ side while they'reÂ out. That helps the blood flow to theirÂ brain and gives themÂ a chance to recover more quickly.\n\nIn very rare cases, a child may not start breathing again after 1 minute. If this happens, call 911. If they'reÂ still not breathing after 3 minutes, start CPR.\n\nPrevention\n\nYour childâs doctor may teach you how to spot triggers that cause the spells, so you may prevent them. Sometimes, blowing hard on your babyâs face can interrupt a breath-holding spell. But this wonât work for every baby, and it may not work for older children.\n\nIf temper tantrums set off breath-holding attacks, your doctor may help you figure out a new way to set limits for your child. Take care not to give in to your child just to avoid a spell. This can lead to behavior problems that may last even after they'reÂ outgrown theirÂ breath-holding spells."
