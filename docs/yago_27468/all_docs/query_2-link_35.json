        "text": "One day while I took subway home, I noticed a poster on the wall. The poster was about Avatar the movie, which was of course, BLUE.\n\nThe close shot shown in it came with a question: why do they make it blue, but not red, yellow or green? I keep the interesting question in mind and search for information about historical use of blue on human face and body. Here is what I found to be interesting.\n\nOne of the interesting things is, as the only primary color which is labeled as cold color, which tends to create a cool and low-key feeling, BLUE in some cultures and religions is given an opposite meaning, that is, to show braveness, boldness and courage.\n\nBack to the movie Avatar, Director James Cameron once mentioned the image and inspiration of the alien race had a relationship with the Hindu gods. One of the most famous ones related to blue is called Vishnu. He is often pictured as blue-skinned with yellow dress. Some believe that it is because blue is the maximum in the nature, which is the color of the sky, the oceans, rivers and lakes, thus has a meaning of eternity and ubiquity. The deity who is brave, manly and resolute is given the color blue representing his stable mind and depth of character.\n\nThe phenomenon exists in other cultures. Colors are given certain meanings in Peking Opera. Thus one who familiar with the principles can tell if a new character on the stage stands for good or bad, brave or timid, clever or reckless, just by seeing the color on his face. The whole idea always comes with shapes, but from the transition of a certain mask used for a character we can see the changes are mostly on shapes and the main tone of color remains the same.\n\nBlue has a meaning of straightforwardness, valiancy and sometimes resourcefulness in Peking Opera masks. The characters using blue as a main tone more or less share the manly characteristics, which have similarity to the representation of blue in hinduism.\n\nThe two findings above inspire me on the study of blue color on face or body. Julius Caesar mentioned Celts used to dye themselves blue in face in the fights to scare the enemies. This, which can’t be fully approved, depicts some of the use of blue in that ancient tribe and influence the art work related afterwards. This interestingly also related to masculine characteristics.\n\nImagined rendering of a Pict by John White\n\nFrom movie “Braveheart”. The Scotland worriers paint the face blue.\n\nTill now I’ve been talking about blue faces using in history. I tried to find some recently blue faces for further study. Here comes the “Blue Man Group”.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1987. Their identity of blue went famous after featured in Intel commercials. The question of why they chose blue to be their signature shade had been asked in an interview with Michael Quinn, the Artistic Director. He answered: “Blue just felt right on all counts. All other colors had some sort of connotation that we didn’t want. Green was alien or Martian, and it represents envy. Red is angry or has socio-political connections. Black and white have racial connotations. Yellow is jaundiced and sickly. Blue was perfect. It represents serenity, calmness. It represents water, the stuff of life. It is neutral, vibrant, and simple.”\n\nWell, that might be a direction headed by modern people, but have you noticed there isn’t any “blue woman” ever shown up?"
