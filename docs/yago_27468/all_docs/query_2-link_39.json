Call 999 or go to your nearest emergency department immediately if you notice an adult or child suddenly turning blue.\n\nWhen to seek emergency help\n\nCall 999 or go to your nearest emergency department immediately if you notice an adult or child suddenly turning blue.\n\nThis is particularly important if they have other symptoms, such as:\n\ndifficulty breathing\n\nchest pain\n\nThis could be a sign of a life-threatening problem.\n\nWhen to see your GP\n\nSee your GP if you have cyanosis that:\n\ncomes on very gradually\n\naffects just the fingers, hands, toes or feet\n\nThis is usually the result of a less serious problem with blood circulation, but it should still be checked by a doctor.\n\nCommon causes of cyanosis\n\nWhen blood has less oxygen than normal, it changes from bright red to darker in colour, making the skin and lips look blue. Some of the main causes of cyanosis are described below. You shouldn't use this to diagnose yourself. You should always leave that to your GP.\n\nCyanosis that just affects the hands, feet or limbs\n\nIf just the fingers, toes or limbs have turned blue and feel cold, it's known as peripheral cyanosis.\n\nIt can be caused by being exposed to cold air or water. Other causes include poor circulation resulting from:\n\nRaynaud's phenomenon\n\nperipheral arterial disease (PAD)\n\nbeta-blockers – medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure\n\na blood clot blocking the blood supply to or from a limb\n\nCyanosis that affects the skin generally and/or lips\n\nWhen all the skin and/or lips have a blue tinge, it's known as central cyanosis. It is usually a sign of low levels of oxygen in the blood. Common causes for central cyanosis are listed below.\n\nA problem with the lungs:\n\nworsening of a long-term lung condition, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\nlung infections, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis or whooping cough\n\nbronchiectasis\n\na pulmonary embolism\n\nneonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\ndrowning or nearly drowning\n\nA problem with the airways:\n\nchoking\n\ncroup\n\nepiglottitis\n\nanaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)\n\nA problem with the heart:\n\nheart failure\n\ncongenital heart disease\n\ncardiac arrest\n\nOther causes:\n\nexposure to cold air or water\n\nbeing at high altitude\n\nfits (seizures) that last a long time\n\na problem with the blood, such as abnormal haemoglobin (the blood can't take up enough oxygen) or a high concentration of red blood cells (polycythaemia)\n\nMore useful links\n\nHow to use your health services\n\nThe information on this page has been adapted from original content from the NHS website.\n\nFor further information see terms and conditions."
