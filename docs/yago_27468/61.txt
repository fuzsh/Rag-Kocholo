Blue In The Face (Miramax, R) The second collaboration between director Wayne Wang and novelist-screenwriter Paul Auster is set in the same cozy-seedy Brooklyn cigar store that served as the hub for their art-house hit, Smoke. This time, though, no one’s minding the store. Shot in less than seven days, Blue in the Face is a semi-improvisatory funk vaudeville — a rambling series of actors’ riffs on the Brooklyn state of mind. For 85 minutes, an assortment of neighborhood geeks and weirdos pop into the store, laying down random complaints and dropping a wistful anecdote or two about the Dodgers. Every so often a star shows up: Michael J. Fox (funny) as a scatalogical-minded researcher, Roseanne (not) as a housewife who longs to go to Vegas. Wang and Auster throw fragmentary comic bits in the air like so much confetti, hoping that the result coheres into a rowdy cinematic block party. It doesn’t, but there are some highlights. Lou Reed, speaking directly into the camera, proves a zestfully dry raconteur, and director Jim Jarmusch, as a guy who shows up to smoke one last cigarette before quitting, disarms the film’s contortions with his relaxed wit. But most of the actors seem stranded in a sitcom without a situation. It’s a rare feat, too, to make Harvey Keitel annoying. As Auggie, the master of cigar-store ceremonies, he’s as sweet and winsome and rabbinical as he was in Smoke — which is to say, a pain. C
