🌏 Competitive freeriding is truly becoming a global phenomenon. ⛷ It all begins with the riders themselves, and the Sports Pyramid emphasizes the journey a rider can embark on, from grassroots series to competing against top world riders. 🏂 This past winter, we registered more than 8,500 licensed riders worldwide, hailing from 71 different countries. ↗ As of now, we've accumulated a total of 255 events across our different tours. 🤝 A substantial combined effort is carried out by all our co-organizers, host resorts, and partners to advance the sport. 👀 New discussions are already underway to initiate events in new markets and continue providing freeride competitions to enthusiasts in a safe and coherent ecosystem. 🙏 Thanks to all those contributing to the ever-growing galaxy that is the Freeride World Tour. #fwt #sports #development

Yesterday was not just another day at the office. Aneo Build had the opportunity to invite some of our valued customers and partners to the FIS Cross Country Ski World Cup sprint event in Drammen ⛷️🏆 Great event, with a nice venue! It made me think about some of the things I wanted to implement when organizing supersprints. I think xc skiing can benefit from doing stuff a little different in the future, to capture a wider audience and the younger generation (with its shorter attention span). 🏙️ More events closer to where people live. Minneapolis, Davos, Oslo and Drammen are examples on great venues. Why not build something more around it – like the “Grand Slams” or “The Majors”. The race calendar needs to be more sustainable, so make each stop count. Add a few evening races during weekdays in the most popular venues and do some open sessions with the local kids to promote the sport. I don’t think cross country skiers need to compete every weekend, so my suggestion is to remove some of the not so interesting races from the World Cup. And by any means keep the 50k in Holmenkollen with all its history and glory. 📺 Enhance viewer experience on TV and media platforms. There is no reason to not take advantage of data. The big sports are now tracking the athletes. The NBA got all the athletes records covered, in the Premier League you get to see heat map, number of sprints, top speed and so on. You can use sports tech like GPS and HR, and implement on-screen infotainment to give the audience a better experience and the commentators something to talk about. And btw, research shows that the average attention span of Gen Z individual is less than that of millennials – so maybe I should come back and organize some more supersprints after all. #crosscountryskiing #FIS #xcskiing

In this interesting article by World of Show Jumping on USA Show Jumping Athlete Cathleen Driscoll, she shared her perspective on team ownership and athlete backing in the US: "I find the owners in the US prefer to back men. I don't know why but I think it's much easier for male riders to get owners and if you have a great team owner behind you and you can have a strong string of horses, you can move up on the ranking list, get into bigger shows, and get better opportunities. I think we are lacking good owners especially for female riders. I think it's harder for us to get owners and it really shouldn't be. I think we are missing out on a lot of talent that just needs opportunity." Despite show jumping sport having exceptional growth similar to the growth now seen in Formula One in regard to investment in elite level competitions, tours, venues, major sponsorship, broadcasting, endorsements, and media deals, Driscoll's statements still ring true. There is a definite lack of diversity among the athletes at the highest level of show jumping sport and a lack of investment into women riders and riders of color resulting in much talent going undiscovered. Sometimes all it takes is one opportunity to help change this continued trajectory. https://lnkd.in/gXKe_iTp

Who else is watching the Olympics? 🏅🏊♀️ On Saturday, I was watching the women’s synchronised diving and the GB team fought their way to a bronze medal! 🥉 The focus, the control, and the emotions - it was a brilliant watch. It made me think about how we, as business owners, can achieve greatness if we apply the same laser focus and passion. If we continue to push, even when times are hard, the consistency in trying and a never-give-up attitude can make the difference between success and downfall. Sometimes the springboard feels wobbly, but it’s by standing on it we will find our balance and be able to dive confidently towards medals. What has been your highlight so far during these Summer Games? ⛹️♀️ Have these athletes inspired you to push beyond your limits to do better and grow in your business? 🎖 #businessgrowth #businessfocus #business
