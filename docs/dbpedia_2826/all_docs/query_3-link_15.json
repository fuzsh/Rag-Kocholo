        "text": "Background\n\nTwo centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off after King Olav TRYGGVASON adopted Christianity in 994; conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Norway remained neutral in World War I and proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but Nazi Germany nonetheless occupied the country for five years (1940-45). In 1949, Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities, maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.\n\nDemographic profile\n\nNorway is a trendsetter country in gender equality, especially in workforce participation.Â Of particular value to families are the child and parental leave benefits.Â This supplement is a monthly allowance paid to families from a month after birth until the child reaches 18 to defray some of the costs of raising children.Â This is helpful to families with young children where the mother works limited hours.Â The parental leave benefit is available to qualified mothers in a childâs first year, enabling parents to share at-home childcare for up to 49 weeks at full salary (or 59 weeks with 80% of their salary).Â Afterward, parents can put their child in high-quality subsidized daycare or receive funding toward private child care or as compensation for one parent staying home to care for their child.\n\nNorway was originally a country of emigration with almost 850,000 Norwegians going abroad between 1825 and 1945.Â At the turn of the 20th century, most Norwegians emigrated temporarily to work in the US.Â Immigrants to Norway in the 1960s were mostly from neighboring Nordic countries, with whom they shared a common labor market.Â By the end of the 1960s, with a strong economy and population shortage, Norway admitted guest workers from Pakistan, Morocco, then Yugoslavia, and Turkey.Â The labor migrants were expected to be temporary, but many settled in Norway.Â Eventually, Norway imposed immigration restrictions and the majority of migrants came in as refugees or for family reunification.Â Beginning in the 1990s, Norwayâs migration policy aimed at achieving integration â including language instruction and integration into the job market â as well as combatting racism and xenophobia.\n\nCapital\n\nname: Oslo\n\ngeographic coordinates: 59 55 N, 10 45 E\n\ntime difference: UTC+1 (6 hours ahead of Washington, DC, during Standard Time)\n\ndaylight saving time: +1hr, begins last Sunday in March; ends last Sunday in October\n\netymology: the medieval name was spelt \"Aslo\"; the as component refered either to the Ekeberg ridge southeast of the town (\"as\" in modern Norwegian), or to the Aesir (Norse gods); lo refered to \"meadow,\" so the most likely interpretations would have been either \"the meadow beneath the ridge\" or \"the meadow of the gods\"; both explanations are considered equally plausible\n\nMilitary service age and obligation\n\n19-35 years of age for selective compulsory military service for men and women; 17 years of age for male volunteers; 18 years of age for women volunteers; 12-19 month service obligation; conscripts first serve 12 months between the ages of 19 and 28, and then up to 4-5 refresher training periods until age 35, 44, 55, or 60 depending on rank and function (2024)\n\nnote 1: individuals conscripted each year are selected from a larger cohort who are evaluated through online assessments and physical tests; for the 2023 conscription cohort, over 24,000 men and women were selected for the physical tests, and from among them about 9,800 were selected for military serviceâ36 percent were women; Norway has had compulsory military service since 1907\n\nnote 2: Norway was the first NATO country to allow women to serve in all combat arms branches of the military (1985); it also has an all-female special operations unit known as Jegertroppen (The Hunter Troop), which was established in 2014; as of 2023, women comprised about 20% of the military's full-time personnel\n\nnote 3: beginning in 1995, the military began offering Icelandic citizens the opportunity to apply for admission to officer schools in Norway with an associated education and service contract under special reasons and based on recommendations from Icelandic authorities; as early as 1996, Norway and Iceland entered into a cooperation agreement on the voluntary participation of Icelandic personnel in Norwegian force contributions in foreign operations\n\nMilitary - note\n\nthe Norwegian Armed Forces (Forsvaret) are responsible for protecting Norway and its allies, including monitoring Norwayâs airspace, digital, land, and maritime areas, maintaining the countryâs borders and sovereignty, contributing to NATO and UN missions, and providing support to civil society, such as assisting the police, search and rescue, and maritime counterterrorism efforts; the militaryâs territorial and sovereignty defense missions are complicated by Norwayâs vast sea areas, numerous islands, long and winding fjords, and difficult and mountainous terrain; a key area of emphasis is its far northern border with Russia\n\nNorway is one of the original members of NATO, and the Alliance is a key component of Norwayâs defense policy; the Forsvaret participates regularly in NATO exercises, missions, and operations, including air policing of NATO territory, NATOâs Enhanced Forward Presence mission in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, and standing naval missions, as well as operations in non-NATO areas, such as the Middle East; the Forsvaret also cooperates closely with the militaries of other Nordic countries through the Nordic Defense Cooperation (NORDEFCO; established 2009), which consists of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden; areas of cooperation include armaments, education, human resources, training and exercises, and operations; Norway contributes to the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a pool of high-readiness military forces from 10 Baltic and Scandinavian countries designed to respond to a wide range of contingencies both in peacetime and in times of crisis or conflict with a focus on the High North, North Atlantic, and Baltic Sea regions; the Forsvaret participates in UN missions in such areas as Africa and the Middle East; Norway has close military ties with the US, including rotational US military deployments and an agreement allowing for mutual defense activities and US military forces to access some Norwegian facilities\n\nthe Forsvaret's origins go back to the leidangen, defense forces which were established along the coastline in the 10th century to protect the Norwegian coast (2024)\n\nSpace program overview\n\nhas a broad and active space program coordinated with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the EU; jointly designs and builds satellites with foreign partners, including communications, remote sensing (RS), scientific, and navigational/positional; operates satellites; develops and launches sounding rockets; researches and produces a range of other space-related technologies, including satellite/space launch vehicle (SLV) and space station components, telescopes, and robotics; conducts solar and telecommunications research;
