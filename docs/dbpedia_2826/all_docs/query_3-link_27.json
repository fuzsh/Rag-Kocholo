        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nOslo is the demographic, economic and political centre of Norway. As the capital of Norway, Oslo hosts several national institutions within government, education, culture, sports and transport. The city has a good selection of cultural institutions and a good selection of restaurants, some world class but most ordinary, as well as night life in general. While it is an expensive city for some overseas visitors, many of the best things are free of charge, notably Oslo's proximity to wild nature, inner city parks and variety of outdoor activities.\n\nMetropolitan Oslo also includes most of Akershus county and the line between these is so blurred that the two is seen as one city. Local public transport such as the Oslo metro covers Oslo proper and the surrounding districts. Oslo proper has over 700,000 inhabitants while metropolitan Oslo has well over 1 million inhabitants. Oslo's influence is felt well beyond the metropolitan area and the wider \"Oslo region\" includes the densely populated lowlands around the inner Oslo fjord and the flatlands around the airport. This region covers only 5% of Norway's area but has 25 to 30% of the population.\n\nName and history\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vikings and the Old Norse, Nordic history\n\nThe history of the city can be traced back to at around year 1000. Oslo was according to the ancient saga founded by king Harald HardrÃ¥de in 1048, and became a diocese in 1070. The city became the capital of Norway around 1300, but lost its privileges during the Danish-Norwegian union from 1348 to 1814. In 1624, a fire devastated old Oslo, and the city was moved some kilometres west to gain protection from the fortress at Akershus. The new city was built in a strict grid plan that still appears modern, this area is now within downtown Oslo (between Akershus fortress and Oslo cathedral) and known as Kvadraturen. The expanding city Christiania was built on the land of the Aker estate so the river and the oldest church are \"Aker\" river and church respectively. Christiania developed west of the Aker river, while Old Oslo became a backwater between Alna river and Ekeberg hill.\n\nThe new city was named Christiania, after the Danish King Christian IV, a name that remained until it was officially named Oslo on 1 January 1925 to remove the Danish name. Old Oslo, which had retained its name since the middle ages, was then renamed Gamlebyen (\"Old town\") to avoid confusion. In Gamlebyen there is a Oslo street, Oslo square and Oslo hospital. The original town Christiania built in 1624 is now called Kvadraturen and is the oldest part of Oslo. Traces have been found close to Ekeberg indicating settlement as far back as 10,000 BC. After the 1624 fire Oslo/Christiania was built exclusively from brick and stone; this gives a city clearly different appearance compared with wooden towns like Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim.\n\nAfter the devastating 1624 fire, old Oslo (around the mouth of river Aker) was largely abandoned and the ruins converted to farmland. Today, a few church ruins are still visible under the Ekeberg hill (across the water from the new opera house, between road E18 and the railway). Beyond these ruins virtually nothing remains of medieval Oslo. The new city Christiania was established outside the borders of Oslo, and 'Oslo' remained the name of the small, surviving settlement outside the new city borders. During Christiania's rapid expansion in the 19th century, as the capital of a new state, the site of original Oslo (old Oslo, or 'Gamlebyen') was included in the city. Due to the rapid inclusion of surrounding agricultural areas in the 19th century, many remnants of the city's farming history are still clearly visible in place names and farmhouses. The remains of historical pastures can be found at parks such as St. Hanshaugen.\n\nIn 1814 Christiania became the capital of the new state under the Swedish crown. The city was still a small town with a few thousand inhabitants, notably smaller than Bergen. During the 1800s Oslo expanded rapidly to become a big city. In 1850 there were some 30,000 people living in the city, by 1900 this had grown ten-fold, and by 1950 Oslo had more than 500,000 inhabitants. In the 1800s cities in Norway were largely built from wood. From around 1850 Oslo became Norway's only masonry city. Buildings in expanding city was modeled after major European cities, notably Berlin and other German cities. Oslo was for some time known as Little Berlin because of the similarity in architecture. The city council made masonry mandatory and the city was developed with compact blocks and four to five levels. This was a radical departure from traditional Norwegian style with small wooden buildings. Architects were trained in Germany and Danish and German craftsmen took part in the boom.\n\nThe late 1800 masonry buildings and style are largely retained and much better preserved than in Berlin (largely because of the destruction during World War 2). Some 3000 blocks from that period gives Oslo a unique character. Key areas within central parts Oslo are still dominated by this style. For instance GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka, Frogner, Majorstua, St. Hanshaugen and around the Royal Palace. During the rapid expansion during the 1800s previous farmland outside the city gates belonging to city dwellers was included in the city. Enclosed farmland or gardens were called lÃ¸kke and neighborhoods in these areas kept these names for instance RodelÃ¸kka (named after Fredrik Rode) and GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka (named after Friedrich GrÃ¼ner).\n\nWhen Oslo became Norway's capital several building and city development projects began to host national institutions. The striking result is the upper part of Karl Johan street where the parliament building and the royal palace sits at either end. The government building complex in Akersgata were added later perpendicular to the Karl Johan axis. The supreme court building is next door. When the railway age came to Norway Oslo got one station in the east (the current central station) and one in the west. Trains now run in a tunnel under the centre and the west station building now hosts the Nobel peace centre at the entrance to Aker Brygge.\n\nThe rapid expansion in the late 1800s was particularly related to the heavy industry around Akerselva (river). The river and waterfalls provided water and power to the factories, ship building along fjord notably what is today Aker brygge was also important. Today most heavy industry has left the city. The characteristic red brick factory buildings are largely preserved for instance along Aker river and are interesting sights for instance in the Sagene (literally Saw mills) neighbourhood. Akerselva was in the middle ages called Frysja (\"the cascading one\") referring to the many small waterfalls. There are some 20 waterfalls.\n\nModern competitive skiing was developed in Oslo. Ski jumping, cross-country skiing and downhill/slalom races have been held in Oslo since 1866. Downhill/slalom were further developed in the Alp region and then got the name \"alpine skiing\". This strong tradition is visible in the imposing Holmenkollbakken (a ski jumping venue) and a fine network of cross-country tracks throughout the Oslo forest, as well as the skiing museum.\n\nSince 1947, Oslo has given a big Christmas tree to London in gratitude for the help and support to Norway during World War 2. The tree is prominently displayed on Trafalgar Square and decorated in Norwegian style.\n\nWhile Oslo has been a safe city in modern times, the government district was hit by a terrorist bomb blast in 2011, killing eight people. The damaged buildings have not been replaced (as of 2020).\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nOslo, with its approximately 453 kmÂ², is one of the largest capitals in the world by area, but most of it is forest, making Oslo a city in close contact with the nature surrounding it. If major suburbs outside city limits are included, metropolitan Oslo covers an area similar to Greater London but with only one tenth of London's population. The Oslo fjord extends northwards from the Skagerrak sea. Oslo has an impressive archipelago of islands, which in summer becomes the city's favoured playground. The Oslofjord has very little tide, about 50 cm only.\n\nOslo is situated in an amphitheatre-like setting, with the city centre in the bottom close to the Oslo fjord, and residential areas stretching uphill from there in all directions. Central Oslo is relatively even and stretches from sea level to about 100 meters above sea level, but the settlement stretches to almost 500 meters above sea level. The city is surrounded by forested hills known as Marka (Nordmarka, Ã˜stmarka, Lillomarka), with flora and fauna that is quite extraordinary for a city of this size. Moose are commonplace (easily spotted in winter), and the whole of the capital is part of Norway's wolf reserve (even if they rarely come here).\n\nThe city centre is bounded by Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) to the east, the Royal Palace (Slottet) to the west and the seafront (from Akershus fortress to Aker brygge) to the south. It's fairly compact and easily walkable. Karl Johans gate, the mostly pedestrian main street connecting Oslo S and the Palace, is the main artery of downtown Oslo. However, several of the neighbourhoods close to the centre hold interesting sights and entertainment offerings, so to explore these you should make use of the city's comprehensive public transport system.\n\nEuropean Green Capital 2019\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Oslo has been recognized as the European Green Capital for 2019. This means that the city is in a process of achieving the global goals for a better climate and to minimize the air pollution and the water pollution within the city. There is also a strong focus on reuse to reduce litter. Maximum environmental friendly transport is also one of the ambitions. Read more about the environmental initiative here.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough well into the northern latitudes, Oslo's climate is fairly temperate thanks to warm air being wafted across the Atlantic from the Gulf Stream. Summer weather in Oslo is mild and pleasant, with frequent hot spells with daily highs above 25Â°C or up to 30Â°C, and plenty of long sunny days â€” at midsummer the sun rises at 04:00 and sets at 23:00. There is almost two hours twilight in summer so nights are hardly dark. There is moderate precipitation (about 800 mm), December to June is the driest period. December to February temperatures are on average just below freezing, while in November and March temperatures hover just above or below freezing. Temperatures are rarely below -10Â°C downtown and can occasionally drop to -20 Â°C. Snow is most often plentiful in the forested areas and also often in the city in winter, making it a great winter sports venue. Rainfall is spread across the year, the rainiest month being August.\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nOslo proper has a population of 647,000 people, or close to 1 million when including its extra-municipal suburbs (such as BÃ¦rum and LÃ¸renskog). The Oslo metropolitan area has a population of around 1.4 million. The diverse population includes some of Norway's wealthiest celebrities and socialites, as well as more than 150,000 immigrants. This has made Oslo a highly ethnically and culturally diverse city, with 28% of the city's population having an immigrant background. Accompanied by a large influx of people from all around Norway, Oslo is thus often referred to as the \"melting pot\" of Norway. Cultural differences have affected Oslo's society and cityscape in matters of for instance dining and shopping, which have all blended in to the everyday life of Oslo's population. Some areas of Oslo, especially around GrÃ¸nland and TÃ¸yen, and many suburbs east of the city centre, have majority-immigrant or majority non-ethnic Norwegian populations. Depending on the area, the most notable immigrant communities are Pakistani, Swedish, Polish, Somali, Sri Lankan, Iraqi, Vietnamese, Iranian, ex-Yugoslavian, Moroccan, Turkish, Albanian, Filipino, Thai and Danish. Pakistani immigrants and their descendants form the largest minority group in Oslo.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Oslo region is the country's premier business centre and has a diverse and dynamic economy with one of the highest regional GDPs in Europe. Figures published by the regional development agency for Oslo show that GDP per capita in the region was â‚¬44,190 (excluding oil and gas) in 2000, compared to an EU average of approximately â‚¬20,000. According to a report produced by the city's Chief Commissioner's Department and the Department of Finances and Development, the service sector dominates employment in Oslo. In 2001, Public and Business services accounted for more than 59 percent of jobs. Other major employment areas within the service sector include trade, hotels and catering, banking and insurance.\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the latest reform of January 1, 2004, the city is divided into 15 boroughs (bydeler). Most tourist attractions are concentrated in the city centre (Sentrum). Some other districts of note are Frogner, a hilly residential district with the namesake park famous for the Vigeland sculptures in the West, and GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka in the Inner East, hub for nightlife and the creative scene.\n\nTraditionally, Oslo has been divided into the eastern and western parts, with the West being the more affluent, with elegant buildings and a posh character, and the East consisting of working-class neighbourhoods, growing into a home for both the artistic bohemian and poor immigrant communities.\n\nFor the short-term visitor, navigation is typically related to key buildings and streets in the centre. Karl Johans gate (known merely as Karl Johan) is Oslo's main street and runs from the railway station passed and towards the Royal Palace. Key buildings are concentrated around this street, notably the University, the Nationaltheateret, the Cathedral and Stortinget (Parliament). In the adjacent streets the City Hall, Nobel peace centre (previous West station), Ministries (government buildings), the Supreme court, and major museums. The nightlife district at Aker brygge is a short stroll from Karl Johan. The new Opera house is next door to the railway station. In addition to the Central railway station, next door to the Nationaltheateret and Palace there is the second main station underground served by airport trains, local trains and all metro lines.\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a comprehensive public transport system in Oslo, consisting of buses, trams, local trains, metro (T-bane) and boats. The public transport is planned and coordinated by Ruter[dead link] . The five metro lines have numbers 1 through 5, the six tram lines have numbers 11 through 19, buses have labels from 20, while boats (ferries) are B1, B2 and so forth. Local trains operated by Vy are covered by Ruter ticket system. The local public transport of Oslo also covers the suburbs in Akershus, notably BÃ¦rum in the west, where the tram and metro cross the county line.\n\nRuter Service Center (formerly known as Trafikanten) is the information centre for public transport in Oslo. It is found at Jernbanetorget, just outside Oslo Central Station, by the foot of the clock tower, as well as at Aker Brygge and at Oslo Airport (Gardermoen). They hand out free maps, give information and sell all kinds of tickets. The Ruter website has timetables, maps, route planner and search engines for all city transport in Oslo, as well as all transport in the nearby counties of Akershus, Ã˜stfold, Oppland, Hedmark, Buskerud, Vestfold and Telemark. The Oslo Tourist Information Centre is in the same office at Jernbanetorget, at the rear counters.\n\nThere are two main hubs for public transport inside the city centre: Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) / Jernbanetorget and Nationaltheatret (underground). All metro lines pass these stations, all trains pass Oslo S and most trains (including the Airport Express Train (Flytoget)) pass Nationaltheatret. Nationaltheatret is most convenient for key buildings such as the Royal Palace, the National Museum, the Parliament, Oslo Concert Hall and Oslo City Hall.\n\nTickets and the zone system\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Oslo and Akershus public transport utilizes a zone system[dead link] in which the price for a trip is calculated based on how many zones you pass through. For clarity, all ticket prices listed here are for one zone only.\n\nAll public transport runs on the same fare scheme, and the same tickets are valid for all modes of transport. A single ticket costs 40 kr when bought in advance from the app or a kiosk, and 60 kr when bought from a bus or tram driver. After being activated (validated), the single ticket is valid for one hour of free travel in the zones the ticket is valid for. You can also get a Travelcard where you load pay-as-you-go-credit for the price of a single ticket.\n\nThere are also period tickets available; 24-hour ticket (117 kr), 7-day ticket (323 kr), 30-day ticket (814 kr) and 365-day ticket (8,140 kr) for one zone. Read more about the tickets and see prices for multiple zones here.\n\nBuying tickets with the mobile phone application is recommended, and both Apple iOS and Android is supported. Most locals use the app to buy their tickets.\n\nAll these tickets, except 365-day ticket, are half-priced for children (4â€“15 years) and elders (67 and up). 7-day and 30-day tickets are also half-price for youth up to and including 19. Children under the age of 4 ride for free. Children under 16 who travel with an adult travel for free at weekends. If you are bringing a bike, you must buy an additional child ticket. Student discounts for 30-day tickets are also available, but only if you are studying in Oslo or Akerhus area. For a short visit, one additional option is to buy a Oslo Pass which includes free admission to many tourist attractions and other benefits.\n\nThe tickets can either be bought via the mobile phone application or as an RFID chip card at the following locations (for an additional fee of 50 kr for the chip card unless you just top it up). Cards can be bought at Ruter Service Centre (Trafikanten) near Oslo S, at Aker Brygge, at most 7-Eleven, Deli De Luca, Mix and Narvesen kiosks and stores in Oslo and Akershus in addition to other kiosks and grocery shops near stops. All these tickets are also valid on the night lines, running every Friday and Saturday night after the regular service has shut down.\n\nMake sure that you have a ticket with you when travelling and that it is validated before entering the metro platform or boarding the rear door of the bus or tram. 24-hour tickets, 7-day tickets, 30-day tickets, 365-day tickets, Travelcards, single tickets purchased in a kiosk as well as electronic single tickets are not valid until they are activated (validated). On a bus or tram, the tickets are activated (validated) when you board; activating by holding the card next to a card reader. On the metro and the large railway stations, you activate the ticket before entering the train. There are no checks getting on to T-banes, trams or buses, but if you choose to ride ticketless look out for inspectors as random spot checks are common and being caught without a valid ticket leads to an automatic fine of at least 1200 kr. (Read more about ticket control[dead link] ) Mobile tickets purchased through the Entur, Vy or Ruter app are validated by tapping the corresponding button on the app; they do not need to be scanned against a reader (except during the random spot inspections when requested by the inspector).\n\nThese tickets are not valid on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget), the Airport Coach (Flybussen and Flybussekspressen) etc. [dead link] , each of which are operated by companies other than Ruter or Vy.\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nOslo has a fairly large metro system (subway) consisting of 5 lines. It is known as the Tunnelbane or mainly just T-bane in Norwegian. The metro covers the city centre core and a large part of the suburban residential areas. The metro does not cover popular areas close to the city centre such as Bislett, St. Hanshaugen, Frogner, GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka and Sagene. These areas are easily reached by bus or tram.\n\nTo find a T-bane station, just look for the blue and white logo with a \"T\" within a circle. There are five lines, but the network is easy enough to figure out: all lines merge to one single tunnel through the city centre, from Majorstuen through Jernbanetorget (Oslo S/Oslo Central Station) to TÃ¸yen, and then spread out into the suburbs. A loop line runs in a circle from northern Oslo city centre to the centre and back. The loop line is called \"Ringen\" (the ring) in Norwegians. As of 2016 Ringen (line 5) travels and extra loop through the centre on its way to Sognsvann and Vestli. Despite the name the metro trains run mostly on the surface, only through the centre the metro tracks and stations are completely underground.\n\nWith rolling stock from the 1960s, the Oslo metro used to be one of the most run-down in Europe, but it has now been fully replaced with new metro trains engineered by Siemens and designed by Porsche. The T-bane is a fast and comfortable way to move around Oslo. Trains are notably wider than most metros and are spacious with good capacity.\n\nWhen entering a T-bane station, make sure to pick the correct platform: all stations except three on the loop line (Sinsen, Storo and Nydalen) have separate entrances and separate platforms for trains going west and trains going east. Because the lines of the Oslo metro share tracks and platforms line number and destination are indicated on each train instead of at the platform as is common on many other metros. So the line numbers actually refer to the trains and not the tracks. There are also automated information panels with real-time information the destination, line number and expected arrival of the next train. Make sure to get on the right train. The six stations in the centre (TÃ¸yen to Majorstuen) are served by all lines. The northeastern Groruddalen suburbs (from Vestli terminal station) are served by line 4 and 5 on the same track, while they split of after Ã˜kern station. Note that on Line 1 the doors in the last segment of a train will not open between FrÃ¸er and Frognerseteren (which includes Holmenkollen) because the platforms are too short.\n\nIf you have an electronic ticket, you should theoretically validate the ticket before entering the platform; however this is not yet enforced rigidly (but the ticket must still be valid (activated)).\n\nBy bus or tram\n\n[edit]\n\nTrams[dead link] and buses[dead link] complement the metro network, and use the same tickets. They cover most of the city, and run from approx. 05:00 to 00:00, on some lines up to 01:00. Two bus lines, 31 and 37, runs all night, every day.\n\nAll tram lines run every 10 minutes during the day, and every 20 minutes at night and early morning (30 min at weekend mornings). The main lines cover parts of the city with no metro, and are an efficient way of getting around. The main, central tram terminal is at Jernbanetorget, where all lines converge. The six tram lines are 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 19. The oldest (1982) trams are still running (as of 2023) and are relatively comfortable, but there are stairs to get inside. The city of Oslo has purchased brand new trams that are becoming operational by 2024. Trams roll gently around the city with big windows and is a fine way of sightseeing.\n\nBus lines cover the rest of the city, as well as several ring lines. Nearly all central bus lines converge at Jernbanetorget. The most useful bus lines for visitors are buses 30, 31, 32, 34, 37 and 54, passing by Jernbanetorget and covering parts of the city with no tram or metro lines. Buses 20 and 21 provide central ring-line service, while buses 23 and 24 cover the highway ring road further out. City buses have a deep red color.\n\nNight buses[dead link] cover parts of the city with varying frequency Friday and Saturday. Most of these start or pass by the bus stops close to the Parliament building (Stortinget) and Jernbanetorget (Oslo Central Station/Oslo S). All regular tickets are valid.\n\nRefer to the bus and tram route maps for more information.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal trains (Vy lines L1, L2, L3, L12, L13, L14, L21, L22) cover certain areas of the city (zone 1), and run out to the neighbouring municipalities and towns. The local train network spans across the city limits to neighbouring cities and towns. The local trains use the same tickets as the metro, trams, and buses within Oslo and Akershus counties, but a different pricing scheme is used on journeys beyond that.\n\nSome of the cars on local trains have orange doors, with the notice \"Ubetjent\" and \"Carriage without Conductor\". These cars are usually not visited by the conductor (except during inspections), and you can use these cars only if you have a ticket which is stamped or pre-validated, and does not need to be stamped by the conductor. You may be fined 950 kr if you use one of these carriages without, say a single ticket, and a conductor does come to check your tickets. If you are unsure about the rules, play it safe and ride in one of the carriages with black doors and notices marked \"Betjent\" and \"Carriage with Conductor\".\n\nIn the centre, the main station is Oslo Sentralstasjon (Oslo S), which connects to the metro station Jernbanetorget through a direct link (escalators down by track 1/exit to Oslo City shopping centre/bus terminal) and most bus/tram lines above ground. The second downtown station, served by most local trains and several regional ones, is the underground station Nationaltheateret, and is located immediately below the metro station of the same name. Most westbound buses also stop just outside the station.\n\nPunctuality, especially in the winter, can be an issue as the train system is quite run down. However, things have improved since a big program of refurbishment was started in 2010. Regular Ruter tickets are valid on the Vy trains, but not on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget), which cannot be used to commute solely between points that do not involve the airport.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nA system of local boats runs from Aker Brygge near the city hall.\n\nThe islands in the Oslofjord are served year round, although there are only a few departures wintertime. The regular Ruter tickets are valid on these boats.\n\nFrom March to October a passenger ferry runs from Aker Brygge to BygdÃ¸y, with many major museums. Pre-purchased tickets from the ticket office cost 45 kr one way, or 65 kr for a return ticket. One way tickets may also be purchased on board but cost 60 kr. The Ruter tickets are not valid on the BygdÃ¸y Ferry, but the Oslo Pass is.\n\nFrom Aker Brygge, there are also departures for Nesodden and Slemmestad. These run out of Oslo, and are not covered by the Oslo tickets. However, they provide a cheap cruise on the Oslofjord.\n\nBy bike and scooter\n\n[edit]\n\nOslo has a public bike service which operates from approx. March to November (closed when it's snowing). Bike stalls are placed in many areas of the city, and this is where you rent and return your bike. Using the Oslo Bysykkel app, you can view all stalls with the number of available bikes and locks in real time, and also unlock a bike when you're close to a stall.\n\nMicromobility providers with dockless options are Voi (scooters), Ryde (scooters) and Bolt (scooters/e-bikes), along with a bike rental company in the downtown Oslo Bike Rental.\n\nAround year 2020 many new bicycle lanes were added to streets inside Oslo (at the same street parking space removed) making cycling easier. Cycle routes through the city are numbered to make navigation easier. There are also joint pedestrian and cycling paths.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis can be expensive with short central hops cost around of 200 kr, so if public transport still runs, use it.\n\nAll taxis in Oslo are licensed, also those driving for the app companies. The limit on the amount of taxi licenses was abolished in 2020 to be compliant with EU law, and after that there's been a surge in taxis operating in Oslo. Due to the overcapacity, the market for street-hailing has become a wild west, with prices 2-3x the \"normal\" rates if you pick the wrong taxi\n\nTaxis are obligated to give you a price offer if you give a destination, however no one gives this when using street-hailing. If you get charged 2-3x the normal price, you could try to argue you were not given a price offer. You are likely safer using only Oslo Taxi and NorgesTaxi, or ordering via an app\n\nTaxis in Oslo are frequently new, large and comfortable cars Toyota, Volvo or Mercedes. Most taxis wait for customers in a line in front of hotels or train stations, or you can order one by app of one of the handful of taxi companies. You can also flag one from the street, or go to a taxi stand.\n\nSeveral companies compete to have the most incomprehensible price structure. All taxi companies have a starting fee (0-160 kr) and a fee per kilometre that varies from 14-30 kr. These fees vary by taxi company and time of day. Usually, there's three different rates: The lowest one is the day rate, usually between 06:00 and 18:00. The next is the evening and night rate, usually 18:00-06:00 Monday to Friday and 06:00-18:00 on Saturdays. The last rate is usually for Saturday night after 18:00 until Monday morning at 06:00, but different companies do have different time frames. Beware that some companies will operate with a special holiday rate (helligdagstakst) on public holidays, including the night before, which will result in staggering rates.\n\nTaxi drivers in Oslo aren't a particularly jolly breed, but they usually do not speed too much, and taxi-crime towards customers is almost non-existent. Sometimes a taxi driver will attempt to charge you extra for luggage, and some companies do have a surcharge for this. The price structure should be shown on a sticker inside the car, but is always in so small print, and with an overwhelming amount of detail, you can't possibly decipher it. They are obligated to give you a price offer when you tell your destination, but none abide by this. Another thing that often disturbs visitors is that the taxi drivers' name and license is not printed inside the car itself. If you encounter any problems, ask for a receipt which will help you identify the car later, or make a note of the taxi licence number on the car roof.\n\nAll taxis accept Visa and MasterCard, and the card should be swiped in the meter at the start of the journey for card validation. The driver will usually keep the card on top of the meter so that you can keep an eye on it. If you are uncomfortable with this, it is possible to ask to get the card back, but the card needs to be swiped again when you arrive at your destination.\n\nSome people tip taxi drivers, or round the bill up to the nearest 10kr, but taxi drivers do not generally expect a tip - most people pay the exact amount by card anyway.\n\nTaxi companies in Oslo\n\n[edit]\n\nBy using the Taxi app Vy is an easy way to order a taxi in the Oslo area. This independent app compares prices from different companies.\n\nThe serious companies that are safe to hail from the street is Oslo Taxi and NorgesTaxi, if you hail other companies you may pay 2-3x the normal rate.\n\nYou can use the Uber or Bolt app to order taxis, be aware that some drivers stall or use spoofed GPS to have you cancel if they don't like the trip\n\nBy motor vehicles\n\n[edit]\n\nFor more information on driving, see the Driving in Norway article.\n\nThe major roads entering Oslo is also used for travel inside the city. In the eastern suburbs, road E6 is the main north-south corridor. East-west transport can be done on road E18 as well as Ring 3 running from E18 at the western city border to E6 in the eastern suburbs. The smaller (and slower) Ring 2 connects SkÃ¸yen in the west via Majorstua, UllevÃ¥l general hospital and Carl Berners plass to E18 east of the centre. The ring roads (as well as other main roads) are great for navigation.\n\nAlways give way to trams and pedestrians, unless overridden by signs or traffic lights. Never challenge the tram, they have a long braking distance and will in any case give a loud, clear warning if you are obstructing. In some roundabouts the tram is driving straight through the island while cars must circle, be extremely careful in this type of roundabouts: trams come from the left hand side in roundabouts. Trams are not obliged to yield to pedestrians, while cars must. Park your car in safe distance from the rails as not to obscure the tram (ask locals if unsure). Trams need up to 1.3 meters space on each side of the track.\n\nParking in the inner city is often difficult (street parking) or expensive (parking garages). Street parking signs with \"Mot avgift\" or \"Beboerparkering\" means that there is a fee for parking, and you can use EasyPark or the official app Bil i Oslo to pay. While parking on public streets in Oslo is generally allowed, gradually fewer places are available as streets are redesigned to improve movement for tram, pedestrians and bicycles. In inner Oslo many traditional buildings have gates that just look like big doors and parking in front of these gates is illegal.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Oslo's district articles\n\nThere are a lot of both expensive and cheap places to eat in Oslo. The cheapest restaurants are Asian restaurants which, in many cases, serve good food at low prices.\n\nCheck the menus on the door. Even though you should always use your eyes (and nose) in any food establishment, Norwegian Food and Health regulations are very strict and enforced effectively, so eating out in Oslo is safe.\n\nStreet snacks are also available throughout the city, but they're usually more expensive than in comparable cities elsewhere.\n\nThe locals use Vink from Aftenposten and the business daily DN for curated restaurant reviews â€“ they're well worth a trial subscription that commonly is 1 NOK for the first month, provided you remember to cancel the subscription.\n\nAker Brygge (tram 12, bus 21, 32, 33 or 54; stops Aker Brygge, Vika Atrium or Bryggetorget) is a waterfront located south of the city hall. During summer the area is very noisy and vibrant. There are outdoor restaurants and bars almost everywhere. Be sure to get some tasty seafood (or whatever else you like to eat) while you are there, or just enjoy your cold beer in the summer sea-breeze. This is the most expensive area in Oslo to dine or drink, so unless the weather is good, you can just as well stay indoors somewhere else.\n\nYou are also close to most of the restaurants, bars, or nightclubs located within the city centre. A key reference point will be Stortingsgaten, running parallel to Karl Johans gate, both running eastwards from the Royal Palace (this is also the main shopping area). While both of these streets have a few restaurants and nightclubs, most will be found in one of the side-streets running out from them, or parallel to them. It doesn't matter much where you start, you will find restaurants, bars, and nightclubs almost anywhere from the subway station Nationaltheatret at the west, to far beyond Oslo central railroad station on the east. There are several other areas, such as GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka (tram 11-12-13 to Nybrua, Schous plass, Olaf Ryes plass or Birkelunden), Majorstuen (T-bane, tram 11-12-19 or bus 20-22-25-45-46 to Majorstua), and GrÃ¸nland (T-bane to GrÃ¸nland, bus 37 to TÃ¸yengata or bus 60 to Norbygata) that are worth checking out. Nearly all bars and nightclubs close at the same time, so if you want to get a taxi back to your hotel, try to leave a few minutes before the rush starts.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nTorggata\n\n[edit]\n\nTorggata is a good area for budget dining (from Hausmanns gate south to Youngstorget). You will find cheap Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants and even cheaper kebab-joints and pizzerias, as well as other offerings. It's close to the centre, but you can get bus 34 or 54 to Jacob's church (Jacob kirke), or tram 11-12-13-17/bus 30-31-34-54 to Brugata or Hausmanns gate. The closest T-bane station is GrÃ¸nland (then walk north along Brugata) or Jernbanetorget (then walk north-east).\n\nGrÃ¸nland\n\n[edit]\n\nGrÃ¸nland is full of cheap eating joints, shops selling fabrics and jewelry, Indian and Pakistani sweet shops, cheap beer and more. Several new restaurants and cafes around the Teaterplassen. Cozy Oslo Mekaniske Verksted sell drinks and you can bring your own food from one of the nearby take away.\n\nNorwegian food\n\n[edit]\n\nMost cafes and restaurants serving traditional food are upmarket, but there are a couple of good spots to get stuffed on meat cakes and brown gravy, lutefisk and other delicacies\n\nElsewhere\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can always get your fix of sausage and kiosk-food at reasonable prices, but there are a few restaurants and cafÃ©s worth mentioning. The convenience stores and kiosk chains 7-Eleven and Deli de Luca will provide a choice of pastries, cakes, candy, refreshments and alternate 'snacks', many of which are over-priced and can be bought from a Rema, Kiwi or Bunnpris supermarket at a fraction of the price. When opting for the convenience stores, ask the staff how fresh the counter food is â€“ where most produce is delivered in the morning and evening purchases may see the food lying there for up to 12 hours prior.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nIf price is no object, there is some very fine dining to be found. In BjÃ¸rvika you will find the only 3 stars Michelin restaurant; Maaemo. You will find other Michelin rated restaurants around Oslo in this list.[dead link]"
