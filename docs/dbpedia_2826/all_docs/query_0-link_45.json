        "text": "Note: This is a major revision and update to my earlier post of May 6, 2015. Besides adding 15 new tri-bridges, the pictures missing in the earlier post have been replaced with fresh pictures, and the dead links have been removed or corrected. One proposed bridge, whose construction has been pending since 2002, has been deleted.\n\nTri-Bridges are 3-way bridges on which traffic crosses two water streams or a body of water from three directions, and one can travel from any direction to any other. Because of their shape, these bridges are generally called tri-bridges, Y-bridges, or T-bridges.\n\nOne of the criteria I have used for inclusion in this collection is that at least two spans should be over water.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that many Y-Bridges are just fork bridges where traffic from one direction bifurcates in two directions or vice versa, and there is no three-way traffic. Such bridges have not been included here.\n\nIn addition, there are some recently built 3-way interchange bridges. It is debatable whether a 3-way or T-interchange can be classified as a tri-bridge or not. In a classical sense, a T-interchange is not a tri-bridge, as the interchange is built at 2–3 levels to allow unhampered 3-way traffic and there is no physical trisection point. On the other hand, the conventional tri-bridges have a distinct node or joint, and the traffic from three directions physically merges or demerges over a trisection point on water. In all likelihood, the future 3-way bridges in heavy traffic areas will be T-interchange bridges, as conventional tri-bridges cannot cater to large flow of traffic. As this collection is about conventional tri-bridges, I am not including T-interchange bridges in this collection.\n\nThere are not many tri-bridges in the world. Till now, I have been able to identify only forty-eight (48) tri-bridges, out of which there are nineteen (19) regular vehicular bridges, twenty-seven (27) 3-way foot/cycle bridges, and one (1) disused 3-way footbridge.\n\nNot included in this collection are 4-way bridges. These are much rarer than the 3-way bridges and can be found in this post. However, one (1) 5-way footbridge, which is the only one of its type, has been included in this collection.\n\nThe bridges included in this collection are listed continent and country wise.\n\nVehicular Bridges\n\nY-Bridge (Shiekh Hasina Titas Bridge), Charlohania, Bangladesh.

It is named after Bangladesh's prime minister and is called \"Sheikh Hasina Titas Bridge\". The bridge inaugurated in September 2018 is 771 metres long and 8.10 metres wide and provides easy access to the residents in the wide riverine area around Brahmanbaria.\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Masud Hasan\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of information en.banglatribune.com\n\nCredits: krenek , for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nY-Bridge, Kaptai Lake, Rangamati, Bangladesh\n\nThis 420-metre long and 4.5-metre wide Y-Bridge opened in 2022 connects by road the two islands of Jugolika Hill and Puratanbasti in the Kaptai Lake to the main town of Rangamati and also provides a motorable connection between the two islands.\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Md Liakat Ali\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nSource of information: today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd\n\nCredits: krenek , for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nHama Bridge (Sancha Zijin), Heicheng Village, Hebei, China\n\nLocated in Heicheng Village, Hebei Province, China, this road tri-bridge is locally known as Hama Bridge or Sancha Zijin and was built circa 1691.\n\nImage from Flickr is by Bob\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nCredits: I am thankful to Bob (bridgeink.com) for informing me about this bridge as well as pointing out its exact location in China. Without guidance from him, I couldn't have found this bridge on Google Earth.\n\n3-Way Mukkam Kadavu Bridge, Kerala, India\n\nAlso known as Vent Pipe Bridge, it is Located in Mukkam, Kozhikode, at the confluence of the Iruvazhinji River with its smaller tributary, the Manthra Kadavu River. From the picture shown below, it looks like it is a replacement of an earlier 2-way bridge at the location. Google Earth imagery of April 1, 2020, shows the other 2-way bridge. Subsequent imagery from February 23, 2021, shows some piers of the other bridge. This Google Street View posted on September 2017 shows the other bridge in a dilapidated condition.\n\nIt is perhaps India's first tri-bridge. Its picture was posted on Facebook as early as November 27, 2014.\n\nImage from Wikimedia Commons is by Pkriyas.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nT-Bridge, Cuttack, Orissa, India\n\nThis 3.4 km. long T-bridge over the Mahanadi River connects the townships of Gopinathpur and Baideswar in Cuttack district. It also has a 240-metre long tee-off to an island located in the middle of the river. The tee-off provides permanent, all-weather access to the temple located on the island. Prior to the building of this bridge, the state government used to build a pedestrian track every year on the river bed for passage to the temple, and this track used to get washed away during the rainy season.\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Sai Kalyan\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of information: newindianexpress.com\n\nCredits: krenek , for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nAioi Bridge, Hiroshima, Japan\n\nThis \"T\"-shaped bridge is the historic and tragic bridge which was used as the target point for the dropping of the first atom bomb on August 6, 1945. The bomb missed slightly, exploding in the air over Shima Hospital, located 300 metres away from the bridge. However, the bridge was badly damaged due to the blast.\n\nThe original bridge at the site, meant for streetcars, was completed on December 12, 1932, and had a width of 15 metres. Later in 1934, a 'Tee' connection was added in its central section, which connected it to the island of Jisenji-no-hana (present-day Peace Memorial Park), and it thus got this unique T-shape. Perhaps it was this unique and rare sight which made it the centre of the target.\n\nAfter the war, the bridge was repaired and put back in use, but the bomb had taken its toll, and the bridge gradually deteriorated. A new bridge was therefore constructed at the spot, having a total length of 123.4 metres, a width of 40 metres, a streetcar track, six traffic lanes, and a pedestrian lane.\n\nA few old pillars bearing the marks of the bombing are still preserved at the foot of the present bridge as a mute witness to history. Some of the girders deformed by the blast are also displayed in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\n\nModel showing the town as it existed prior to bombing.\n\nImage from Flickr is by austinmills\n\nView of old pre-bombing bridge.\n\nImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe present bridge.\n\nImage from Flickr is by Gaz Errant\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of info: pcf.city.hiroshima.jp\n\nChu Y Bridge, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nChu Y Bridge spans Tau Hu and Doi canals to link Nguyen Bieu Street in District 5 and Hung Phu and Nguyen Thi Tan streets in District 8. The original bridge at this location was built in 1937. However, to cater for the rising needs of the traffic, it was renovated and enlarged as a part of the East-West Highway Project. The new bridge was inaugurated on April 28, 2009.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nImage from Flickr is by manhhai\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of info: en.metvuong.com\n\nCredits: I am thankful to Faysal Bin Darul, member, Google Earth Community Forums, for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nMangakahia Twin Bridges, (Nukatawhiti, Northland), New Zealand\n\nThis Tri-Bridge located on the confluence of the Awarua River and Mangakahia River, is a T-bridge but is locally known as Twin Bridges. The Mangakahia Road, which passes over the two rivers, has a T-intersection in the middle, with the third limb leading to a scenic reserve.\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Patrick\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nCredits: I am thankful to Kevin Rikys whose comments on my blog (Travelogue of An Armchair Traveller) brought this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nT-Bridge, Hallein, Austria\n\nA distinct T-bridge over the River Salzach at Hallein, Austria. The bridge, officially Stadtbrücke (City Bridge), is about 110 metres long and connects the old town of Hallein to the district of Burgfried. Midway, there is a tee-off to Pernerinsel Island, which lies in the middle of the river.\n\nImage Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of info: Salzburg Wiki (In German) (English Translation)\n\nJasenovac Tri-Bridge, Croatia\n\nThe original 1973 bridge at this location, across the Sava and Una Rivers, was destroyed by Serb forces during the 1991 conflict. A new Y-shaped bridge was built in 2005. One arm of the bridge starts from Jasenovac, spanning the Sava river with a Y-junction in the Uštica. The second arm takes the traffic to Uštica and the third arm, which spans the Una river, crosses the international border connecting Croatia with Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nSource of info: Wikipedia.\n\nPierre Corneille Tri-Bridge, Rouen, France\n\nPierre Corneille Bridge connects the right bank of the River Seine to its left bank through Lacroix Island, Rouen. There is a small T-off bridge to the island, making it a Tri-Bridge. The bridge is named after the famous French writer Pierre Corneille.\n\nA bridge built in 1829 stood here until it was destroyed on June 9, 1940, by French engineers on the arrival of the German army in the city. The present bridge was built in 1952.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nImage Source: Google Street View\n\nMore info: French Wikipedia (English Translation)\n\nMargaret Bridge (Margit Hid), Budapest, Hungary\n\nMargaret Bridge (Margit híd) connects Buda and Pest across the river Danube. It was built between 1872 and 1976 and is the second-oldest bridge in Budapest and one of the most widely used. The main bridge has an angle of 165 degrees, is 637.5 metres long, and is 25 metres wide. Near the midpoint, there is a small third arm leading to Margaret Island. This extension was added to the design at the last stages of design and was built almost 20 years after the completion of the main bridge due to lack of funds.\n\nImage from Wikimedia Commons is by Civertan\n\nImage Source\n\nImage from Flickr is by DurhamDundee\n\nSource of info: Wikipedia\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nCredits: I am thankful syzygy , for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nBridge with Three Entrances (Ponte das Três Entradas), Portugal\n\nPonte das Três Entradas (Bridge with Three Entrances) is a Y-bridge on the confluence of the rivers Alvoco and Alvo in Porugal. Located near Oliveira do Hospital, Santa Ovaia, Coimbra, it was built in 1899, and its construction opened up the whole area, connecting the three neighbouring towns of São Sebastião da Feira, Santa Ovaia, and Aldeia das Dez.\n\nBecause of its unique shape and location, the settlements in the vicinity are also known as 'Ponte das Três Entradas'. The area has also now become a camping site and draws tourists for outdoor activities like fishing and canoeing etc.\n\nImage source: Google Maps\n\nImage Source\n\nSource of info: relvadotrigo.com\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nCredits: I am thankful to mjoaoh, for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nTripartite (Three-Arched) Bridge, Saint Petersburg, Russia\n\nCommonly called \"Tripartite Bridge\" or \"Three-Arched Bridge\", it is actually a pair of two bridges perpendicular to each other and joined in the middle of one of the bridges. One of the bridges is a 15-metre-long Theatre Bridge across the Griboyedov Canal, and the second bridge, which connects to the centre of the Theatre Bridge, is the 18-metre-long Malo-Konyushennyi Bridge across the Moika River. Both bridges rest on a single pier, which forms the junction of the two bridges.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps (Terrain View)\n\nGoogle Maps (Satellite View)\n\nSource of information: Wikipedia\n\nStrömsborg Bridge, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nStrömsborg Bridge (Swedish: Strömsborgsbron) in the old city of central Stockholm, Sweden connects the Strömsborg Islet in the River Norrström to the main Vasa Bridge thereby creating a classical 3-way T-junction.\n\nThe Islet was originally accessible from west side via the Central Bridge (Centralbron) through a causeway built in 1873. In 1954, the Central Bridge was replaced by a new bridge and the Islet was connected from east side to Vasa Bridge by a tee-off in it. The present bridge was built in 1992-1993 and opened on 9 July 1993.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nImage from Flickr is by Bob\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nSource of info: Swedish Wikipedia (English Translation)\n\nCredits: I am thankful to Bob (bridgeink.com) for informing me about this bridge.\n\nLouisa/Fort Gay Tri-Bridge, Kentucky and West Virginia, USA\n\nThe Louisa Louisa/Fort Gay Tri-Bridge at the confluence of the Levisa and Tug Rivers is a T-shaped bridge. Opened in 1906, it is reportedly the only bridge in the U.S.A. which not only spans two rivers but also connects two states (Kentucky and West Virginia), two counties (Lawrence County, Kentucky, and Wayne County, West Virginia), and two cities (Louisa, Kentucky, and Fort Gay, West Virginia).\n\nIts third arm in the centre connects to a land mass in Louisa, KY, which lies just upstream of the confluence point of the two rivers. This land mass is known as \"The Point Section\". Locals enjoy giving directions to strangers wanting to go to the Point section. In the words of my blog's reader vldecker;\n\n' ...... when someone from out of town asked directions to \"The Point Section\" it was always fun to tell them to \"go to the middle of the bridge and turn right\"......

This is the second tri-bridge over the Muskingum River. The other bridge is a Y-Bridge at Zanesville, Ohio.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nY-Bridge, Zanesville, Ohio, USA\n\nThis road bridge is an historical bridge in Zanesville, Ohio, and is popularly known as \"Y-Bridge.\" Located in Zanesville, it spans the confluence of the Licking and Muskingum Rivers and is officially called the Muskingum River Y Bridge. The bridge is a big land mark and was even used as an aviation marker for many years. Amelia Earhart, the famous American aviation pioneer, was quoted as saying “Zanesville is the easiest recognized city from the air because of the Y- Bridge\".\n\nThe present bridge which is 5th at the spot, was opened in 1984. The first Bridge at this location was a wooden bridge and was built around 1814.\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Kyle H\n\nImage from Google Maps is by Malenky\n\nGoogle Street View\n\nSource of Info: Wikipedia\n\nChincoteague Causeway, Chincoteague, Virginia, USA\n\nThe John B.

Built in January 2015, the foot and cycle bridge, spanning Christianshavns and Trangraven Canals in Copenhagen, has two movable decks which operate independently of each other and are raised to allow canal traffic to pass. When the two sections are drawn up at the same time, they look like the wings of a large butterfly, hence the name.\n\nDesigned by Dietmar Feichtinger Architectes, the three sections of the bridge meet over water to form a classical \"Y\" bridge. The bridge has a width of 7.9 metres, and the two movable sections, which are operated by hydraulic cylinders, are 23.3 metres long and, when raised, offer a clear 15-metre-wide opening. The fixed span of the 3-way bridge is 7.80 metres, plus a cantilever connection of 2.60 metres to the canal bank.\n\nImage Source: Google Maps\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSource of info and detailed info: Official Web page of Dietmar Feichtinger Architectes.\n\nSome great images in Arch Daily\n\nCredits: I am thankful to:\n\nDietmar Feichtinger Architectes / Barbara Feichtinger-Felber for allowing the use of images from their web page.\n\nkrenek for bringing this bridge to my knowledge.\n\nDouble Y-Bridges, Under The Three Bridges, Viby, Denmark\n\nIt is an unusual shaped bridge with two Y shaped spans on the each bank of the Arhus River connected by a longer span over the river thus forming a double Y.
