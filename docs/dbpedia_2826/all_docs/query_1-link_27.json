        "text": "Prior to its recent redesign, Gatwick Airport station was described in a 2018 poll by Transport Focus as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúcramped‚Äù. In fact, it was ranked as the 2nd least popular station in Britain! üò¨ In 2016 we were appointed as lead design organisation by Costain Group PLC on GRIP Stages 2-4 ‚Äòdesign and build works‚Äô for the project. Our experts were responsible for providing architectural, structural and civil engineering services (including highways, drainage and environmental design). Our 3 key goals were clear: ü¶∫ Improving safety üîº Increasing capacity üòä Transforming the passenger experience The programme of improvements created more space, relieving overcrowding, and improving the circulation of passengers entering and leaving the station. The new design also provided a more integrated concourse with an intuitive connection between the station, the airport terminals and with onward travel. The concourse floor is now the size of 8 tennis courts! üéæ Find out more about our work on the project: https://loom.ly/Ywo-Sz4 Network Rail #gatwickairport #construction #engineering #Gatwick #GatwickAirport #GatwickAirportstation #rail #station #architecture #civilengineering #structuralengineering #design #stationdesign #highways #drainage #environmentaldesign\n\nA stunning new design for the Baltimore bridge, which faced a disastrous collapse earlier this year, has just been unveiled. Thanks to the innovative minds at Italian design firm Carlo Ratti Associati, structural engineer Michel Virlogeux, and the international construction giant Webuild, the future looks bright and much safer. üö¢ What's New? The redesigned cable-stayed bridge boasts a main span expanded from 1,200 ft to an impressive 2,230 ft, strategically positioning supports in shallow waters far from busy shipping lanes‚Äîtalk about avoiding future mishaps. Plus, the clearance height's getting a bump from 185 ft to 230 ft, aligning with the latest shipping standards and securing the Port of Baltimore‚Äôs role as a global maritime hub. üöó They‚Äôre also widening the road, adding a lane each way to handle more traffic smoothly. This isn‚Äôt just a fix‚Äîit‚Äôs an upgrade to bolster local and national connectivity. This bridge isn‚Äôt just being repaired; it's being transformed to meet the demands of modern transportation. With wider spans and higher clearances, big ships will navigate easily, reducing congestion and enhancing delivery efficiency. It‚Äôs a game-changer for the logistics and transport sectors in and around Baltimore. https://lnkd.in/g4myqV_x #BaltimoreBridge #InfrastructureInnovation #Logistics #Transportation #UrbanPlanning #EngineeringExcellence\n\nPEDESTRIAN/ CYCLE BRIDGES AND ELEVATED WALKWAYS are one of the themes that will be explored at the 12th Australian Small Bridges Conference, 22-23 Oct 2024. We have already accepted a number of abstracts which will explore the design standards, safety, design, construction of such bridges. They interface with roads, railways, and watercourses and are located in both rural and urban environments. Tourism is also very important for many rural towns and so once again we are exploring bridges on Rail Trails and on Walking Trails. Just one of our accepted Abstracts is: KEY CONSTRAINTS OF THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SINGLE SPAN CYCLIST BRIDGE REPLACING A 3-SPAN ROAD BRIDGE OVER A RAIL CORRIDOR Aimee Beheshti, Principal Structural Engineer, Queensland Rail Michael Kozij, Senior Project Engineer, Queensland Rail The design and construction of a pedestrian / cyclist bridge over the rail corridor in a northern suburb of Brisbane is discussed in this paper. The original timber road bridge was closed to traffic due to high level of deterioration with pedestrian and cyclists still allowed to use the bridge. The bridge was ultimately removed due to being considered unsafe with a plan to replace with an active transport bridge to maintain the cross-corridor access for pedestrians and cyclists. The new bridge that was designed and constructed internally by Queensland Rail is a 15m steel through truss replacing a skewed 20m, three span road bridge. The bridge and its approaches had to be DDA compliant. The original bridge was on a steep alignment and hence one end of the new bridge was built up by approximately 1m and introduced DDA approach ramps. The bridge is supported on an existing 70 year-old abutment at the other end. The design attempt was to improve the existing vertical clearance to railway tracks by minimising the deck depth. The bridge was installed in an overnight closure. This paper touches on some of the key issues and constraints and dives into the timeline of the project from removal of the original bridge through to option study, design, fabrication, construction, and installation of the new bridge.

As we celebrate Aviation Month, we‚Äôre looking at Los Angeles International Airport‚Äôs choice of concrete segmental technology in its design of an Automated People Mover (APM). The APM is only part of a project to transform and modernize LAX, and it used a 76-span bridge to finish a 2.25-mile long cast-in-place concrete segmental box-girder structure. The use of concrete segmental construction allowed traffic underneath the project to continue without interruption, and the design accounted for the area‚Äôs strict requirements for seismic resiliency.

The primary reasons for using a bascule bridge include: 1. Waterway Traffic Management: Bascule bridges are particularly useful in locations with high boat traffic. They can be quickly raised and lowered to accommodate both road traffic above and water traffic below, providing an efficient way to manage conflicting transportation modes. 2. Space Efficiency: Unlike some other types of movable bridges, bascule bridges do not require long approaches or extensive ramping for their operation, making them ideal for urban areas where space is limited. 3. Cost-Effectiveness: Bascule bridges can be less expensive to construct and maintain compared to other movable bridges like suspension or cable-stayed bridges, especially when the span required is not exceedingly long. 4. Reliability and Speed: The mechanics of a bascule bridge, which involve a simple pivoting motion with a counterweight, make it a reliable and quick option for allowing water traffic to pass. This is crucial in busy waterways where delays can lead to significant congestion and economic impacts. 5. Aesthetic Flexibility: Bascule bridges offer various design possibilities, allowing them to blend with the local architecture and aesthetics. This flexibility can be important in historic or culturally significant areas. Overall, bascule bridges serve as a practical solution in many scenarios where the integration of navigable waterways and road traffic is necessary. They balance the needs of efficient transportation with economic and spatial considerations. The Twin Sails Bridge (also known as The Second Harbour Crossing) is a double-leaved bascule bridge in Poole, Dorset, England. The bridge provides a second road link from Poole Town Centre to Hamworthy. The intention is that the bridge will allow development of four major sites, two in Poole Town Centre and two in Hamworthy, including the old power station, which was closed in 1988. #bridge #construction #design #engineering #civil #Twinsailsbridge"
