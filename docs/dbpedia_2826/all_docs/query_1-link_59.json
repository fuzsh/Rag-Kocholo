        "meta_description": "The worldwide incidence of pulmonary carcinoids is increasing, but little is known about their molecular characteristics. Through machine learning and multi-omics factor analysis, we compare and contrast the genomic profiles of 116 pulmonary carcinoids (including 35 atypical), 75 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC), and 66 small-cell lung cancers. Here we report that the integrative analyses on 257 lung neuroendocrine neoplasms stratify atypical carcinoids into two prognostic groups with a 10-year overall survival of 88% and 27%, respectively. We identify therapeutically relevant molecular groups of pulmonary carcinoids, suggesting DLL3 and the immune system as candidate therapeutic targets; we confirm the value of OTP expression levels for the prognosis and diagnosis of these diseases, and we unveil the group of supra-carcinoids. This group comprises samples with carcinoid-like morphology yet the molecular and clinical features of the deadly LCNEC, further supporting the previously proposed molecular link between the low- and high-grade lung neuroendocrine neoplasms. The worldwide incidence of pulmonary carcinoids is increasing, but little is known about their molecular characteristics. Here, Alcala and colleagues present a multi-omics analysis of these tumours, revealing distinct molecular and prognostic subgroups.",

        "text": "Sample collection\n\nAll new specimens were collected from surgically resected tumours, applying local regulations and rules at the collecting site, and including patient consent for molecular analyses as well as collection of de-identified data, with approval of the IARC Ethics Committee. These samples underwent an independent pathological review. For the typical carcinoids and LCNEC, on which methylation analyses were performed, the DNA came from the samples included in already published studies4,11,12,13,14,35, for which the pathological review had already been done.\n\nClinical data\n\nCollected clinical data included age (in years), sex (male or female), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, passive smoker, and current smoker), Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, professional exposure, and survival (calculated in months from surgery to last day of follow-up or death). These data were merged with that from Fernandez-Cuesta et al.11, George et al.12, and George et al.14. In order to improve the power of the statistical analyses, we regrouped some levels of variables that had few samples. Age was discretized into three categories ((15, 40], (40, 60], and (60, 90] years), Union for International Cancer Control stages were regrouped into four categories (I, II, III, IV), and smoking status was regrouped into two categories (non-smoker, that includes never smokers and passive smokers, and smoker, that includes current and former smokers). In addition, one patient (S02236) that was originally classified as male was switched to female based on its concordant whole-exome, transcriptome, and methylome data; and one patient (LNEN028) for whom no sex information was available was classified as male based on its methylation data (Supplementary Fig. 28; see details of the methods used in the DNA sequencing, expression, and methylation sections of the methods), because we had no other data type for this sample. Note that two SCLC samples from George et al.14 displayed Y chromosome expression patterns discordant with their clinical data (S02249 and S02293; Supplementary Fig. 28B), but because we did not perform any analysis of SCLC samples that used sex information, this did not have any impact on our analyses. See Supplementary Data 1 for the clinical data associated with the samples.\n\nWe assessed the associations between clinical variables—a batch variable (sample provider), the main variable of interest (histopathological type), and important biological covariables (sex, age, smoking status, and tumour stage)—using Fisher’s exact test, adjusting the p-values for multiple testing. Using samples from all histopathological types (typical and atypical carcinoids, LCNEC, and SCLC), we found that the sample provider was significantly associated with the histopathological type (Supplementary Fig. 29A). Indeed, the 20 carcinoids from one of the providers (provider 1) are all atypical carcinoids. Nevertheless, because there are also seven atypical carcinoids from a second provider and five from a third one, variables provider and histopathological type are not completely confounded and we could check for batch effects in the following molecular analysis by making sure that the molecular profiles of atypical carcinoids from provider 1 overlap with that from the two other providers. The histopathological type was significantly associated with all other variables (Supplementary Fig. 29A, B, and C).\n\nPathological review\n\nSome of the samples included in this manuscript had already undergone a Central Pathological Review in the context of other published studies, so we used the classifications from the supplementary tables of the corresponding manuscripts4,11,12,14,35. For the new ones, an H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) stain from a representative FFPE block was collected for all tumours for pathological review. All tumours were classified according to the 2015 WHO classification by three independent pathologists (E.B., B.A.A., and S.L.). An H&E stain was also performed in order to assess the quality of the frozen material used for molecular analyses and to confirm that all frozen samples contained at least 70% of tumour cells.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n\nFFPE tissue sections (3 µm thick) from 20 atypical and typical carcinoids were deparaffinized and stained with the Ventana DLL3 (SP347) assay, UltraView Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems and Amplification Kit (Ventana Medical Systems—Roche) on Ventana ULTRA autostainer (Ventana, Roche, Meylan, France), and with the CD1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (cl EP3622) (Ventana). The positivity of DLL3 was defined by the percentage of tumour cells exhibiting a cytoplasmic staining, whatever the intensity. The positivity of CD1A was defined by the percentage of the total surface of the tumour exhibiting a membrane staining with 1 corresponding to less than 1%, 2 to a percentage between 1 and 5%, and 3 to greater than 5%. Results are presented in Supplementary Data 9 and representative slides are shown in Fig. 4c.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nAll tests involving multiple comparisons were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure controlling the false discovery rate46 using the p.adjust R function (stats package version 3.4.4). All tests were two-sided. Also, a summary of the statistics associated with survival analyses is provided in Supplementary Data 14.\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nWe performed survival analysis using Cox’s proportional hazard model; we assessed the significance of the hazard ratio between the reference and the other levels using Wald tests, and assessed the global significance of the model using the logrank test statistic (R package survival v. 2.41-3). Kaplan–Meier and forest plots were drawn using R package survminer (v. 0.4.2). Note that three LCNEC samples from George et al.14 had missing survival censor information and were thus excluded from the analysis (samples S01580, S01581, and S01586).\n\nDNA extraction\n\nSamples included were extracted using the Gentra Puregene tissue kit 4g (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. All DNA samples were quantified by the fluorometric method (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay, Life Technologies, CA, USA), and assessed for purity by NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) 260/280 and 260/230 ratio measurements. DNA integrity of Fresh Frozen samples was checked by electrophoresis in a 1.3% agarose gel.\n\nRNA extraction\n\nSamples included were extracted using the Allprep DNA/RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following manufacturer's instructions. All RNA samples were treated with DNAse I for 15 min at 30 °C. RNA integrity of frozen samples was checked with Agilent 2100 Electrophoresis Bioanalyser system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Santa Clara, CA95051, United States) using RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Biotechnologies).\n\nWhole-genome sequencing (WGS)\n\nWhole-genome sequencing was performed on three fresh frozen pulmonary carcinoids and matched-blood samples by the Centre National de Recherche en Génomique Humaine (CNRGH, Institut de Biologie François Jacob, CEA, Evry, France). After a complete quality control, genomic DNA (1 µg) has been used to prepare a library for whole-genome sequencing, using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After normalisation and quality control, qualified libraries have been sequenced on a HiSeqX5 platform from Illumina (Illumina Inc., CA, USA), as paired-end 150 bp reads. One lane of HiSeqX5 flow cell has been produced for each sample, in order to reach an average sequencing depth of 30x for each sample. Sequence quality parameters have been assessed throughout the sequencing run and standard bioinformatics analysis of sequencing data was based on the Illumina pipeline to generate fatsq files for each sample.\n\nWhole-exome sequencing (WES)\n\nWhole-exome sequencing was performed on 16 fresh frozen atypical carcinoids in the Cologne Centre for Genomics. Exomes were prepared by fragmenting 1 μg of DNA using sonication technology (Bioruptor, Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) followed by end repair and adapter ligation including incorporation of Illumina TruSeq index barcodes on a Biomek FX laboratory automation workstation from Beckman Coulter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). After size selection and quantification, pools of five libraries each were subjected to enrichment using the SeqCap EZ v2 Library kit from NimbleGen (44Mb). After validation (2200 TapeStation; Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), the pools were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification kit (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and the 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA), and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing instrument using a paired-end 2 × 100 bp protocol and an allocation of one pool with 5 exomes/lane. The expected average coverage was approximately 120x after removal of duplicates (11 GB).\n\nTargeted sequencing\n\nTargeted sequencing was performed on the same 16 fresh frozen atypical carcinoids and 13 matched-normal tissue for the samples with enough DNA. Three sets of primers covering 1331 amplicons of 150–200 bp were designed with the QIAGEN GeneRead DNAseq custom V2 Builder tool on GRCh37 (gencode version 19). Target enrichment was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Panel PCR Kit V2 (QIAGEN) following a validated in-house protocol (IARC). The multiplex PCR was performed with six separated primers pools [(1) 1 pool covering 786 amplicons, (2) 4 pools covering 498 amplicons, and (3) 1 pool covering 47 amplicons]. Per pool, 20 ng (1) or 10 ng (2 and 3) of DNA were dispensed and air-dried (only 2 and 3). Subsequently 11 µL (1) or 5 µL (2 and 3) of the PCR mix were added [containing 5.5 µL (1) or 2.5 µL (2 and 3) Primer mix pool (2x), 2.2 µL (1) or 1 µL (2 and 3) PCR Buffer (5x), 0.73 µL (1) or 0.34 µL (2 and 3) HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase (6 U/µL) and 0.57 µL (1) or 1.16 µL (2 and 3) H2O] and the DNA were amplified in a 96-well-plate as following: 15 min at 95 °C; 25 (1), 21 (2), or 23 (3) cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 4 min at 60 °C; and 10 min at 72 °C. For each sample, amplified PCR products were pooled together, purified using 1.8x volume of SeraPure magnetic beads (prepared in-house following protocol developed by Faircloth & Glenn, Ecol. And Evol. Biology, Univ. of California, Los Angeles) (1) or NucleoMag® NGS Clean-up from Macherey-Nagel (2 and 3) and quantified by Qubit DNA high-sensitivity assay kit (Invitrogen Corporation). One-hundred nanograms of purified PCR product (6 µL) were used for the library preparation with the NEBNext Fast DNA Library Prep Set (New England BioLabs) following an in-house validated protocol (IARC). End repair was performed [1.5 µL of NEBNext End Repair Reaction Buffer, 0.75 µL of NEBNext End Repair Enzyme Mix, and 6.75 µL of H2O] followed by ligation to specific adapters and in-house prepared individual barcodes (Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany) [4.35 µL of H2O, 2.5 µL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer for Ion Torrent, 0.7 µL of Ion P1 adaptor (double-stranded), 0.25 µL of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA Polymerase, 1.5 µL of T4 DNA ligase, and 0.7 µL of in-house barcodes]. Bead purification of 1.8x was applied to clean libraries and 100 ng of adaptator ligated DNA were amplified with 15 µL of Master Mix Amplification [containing 1 µL of Primers, 12.5 µL of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix, and 1.5 µL of H2O]. Pooling of libraries was performed equimolarly and loaded on a 2% agarose gel for electrophoresis (220 V, 40 min). Using the GeneClean™ Turbo kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) pooled DNA libraries were recovered from selected fragments of 200–300 bp in length. Libraries quality and quantity were assessed using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer on-chip electrophoreses (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing of the libraries was performed on the Ion TorrentTM Proton Sequencer (Life Technologies Corp) aiming for deep coverage (> 250x), using the Ion PITM Hi-QTTM OT2 200 Kit and the Ion PITM Hi-QTM Sequencing 200 Kit with the Ion PITM Chip Kit v3 following the manufacturer’s protocols.\n\nDNA data processing\n\nWGS and WES reads mapping on reference genome GRCh37 (gencode version 19) were performed using our in-house workflow (https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/alignment-nf, revision number 9092214665). This workflow is based on the nextflow domain-specific language47 and consists of three steps: reads mapping (software bwa version 0.7.12-r1044)48, duplicate marking (software samblaster, version 0.1.22)49, and reads sorting (software sambamba, version 0.5.9)50. Reads mapping for the targeted sequencing data was performed using the Torrent Suite software version 4.4.2 on reference genome hg19. Local realignment around indels was then performed for both using software ABRA (version 0.97bLE)51 on the regions from the bed files provided by Agilent (SeqCap_EZ_Exome_v2_probe-covered.bed) and QIAGEN, respectively, for the WES and targeted sequencing data. Consistency between sex reported in the clinical data and WES data was assessed by computing the total coverage on X and Y chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 28A).\n\nVariant calling and filtering on DNA\n\nWES data: We re-performed variant calling for all typical and atypical carcinoid WES, including already published data, in order to remove the possible cofounding effect of variant calling in the subsequent molecular characterisation of carcinoids. Software Needlestack v1.1 (https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/needlestack)52 was used to call variants. Needlestack is an ultra-sensitive multi-sample variant caller that uses the joint information from multiple samples to disentangle true variants from sequencing errors. We performed two separate multi-sample variant callings to avoid technical batch effects: (1) The 16 WES atypical carcinoids newly sequenced in this study were analysed together with 64 additional WES samples sequenced using the same protocol from another study in order to increase the accuracy of Needlestack to estimate the sequencing error rate; (2) The 15 WES LNET (ten typical and five atypical carcinoids) previously analysed (Fernandez-Cuesta et al.)11 were reanalysed with their matched-normal. For both variant callings, we used default software parameters except for the minimum median coverage to consider a site for calling, the minimum mapping quality, and the SNV and INDEL strand bias13 threshold (they were set to 20, 13, 4, and 10, respectively). Annotation of resulting variant calling format (VCF) files was then performed with ANNOVAR (2018Aprl16)53 using the PopFreqAll (maximum frequency over all populations in ESP6500, 1000G, and ExAC germline databases), COSMIC v84, MCAP, REVEL, SIFT, and Polyphen (dbnsfp30a) databases.\n\nWe performed the same variant filtering after each of the two variant callings, based on several stringent criteria. First, we only retained variants that have never been observed in germline databases or present at low frequency (≤ 0.001) but already reported as somatic in the COSMIC database. Second, we only retained variants that were in coding regions and that had an impact on expressed proteins: we filtered out silent, non-damaging single nucleotide variants (based on MCAP, REVEL, SIFT, or Polyphen2 databases) and variants present in non-expressed genes (mean and median FPKM < 0.1 over all carcinoid tumours). Additionally, for calling (2), we re-assessed the somatic status of variants reported by Needlestack in light of possible contamination errors. Indeed, Needlestack is a very sensitive caller and will sometimes detect low allelic fraction variants in normal tissue that actually come from contamination by tumour cells. In such cases the variant is found in both matched samples and is reported as germline, but we still considered a variant as somatic if its allelic fraction in the normal tissue was at least five times lower than the allelic fraction observed in the tumour.\n\nTargeted sequencing data: Software Needlestack was also used to call variants on targeted sequencing data from 16 atypical carcinoids and their matched-normal tissue. We performed the calling with default parameters except for the phred-scaled q-value and minimum median coverage to consider a site (20 and 10, respectively). These parameters were decreased compared to WES variants calling because we wanted a larger sensitivity in the validation set than in the discovery set. The annotation procedure was the same as for WES data. No other filters were used.\n\nValidation: For both previously published data and data generated in this study, we only report somatic mutations that were validated using a different technique: targeted sequencing, RNA sequencing (see below for variant calling in RNA-seq data), or Sanger sequencing. Results are presented Supplementary Data 4.\n\nStructural variant calling\n\nSomatic copy number variations (CNVs) were called from WGS data using an in-house pipeline (software WGinR, available at https://github.com/aviari/wginr) that consists of three main steps. First, the dependency between GC content and raw read count is modelled using a generalised additive smoothing model with two nested windows in order to catch short and long distance dependencies. The model is computed on a subset of human genome mappable regions defined by a narrow band around the mode of binned raw counts distribution. This limits the incorporation of true biological signal (losses and gains) by selecting only regions with (supposedly) the same ploidy. In a second step, we collect heterozygous positions in the matched-normal sample and GC-corrected read counts (RC) and alleles frequencies (AF) at these positions are used to estimate the mean tumour ploidy and its contamination by normal tissue. This ploidy model is then used to infer the theoretical absolute copy number levels in the tumour sample. In the third step, a simultaneous segmentation of RC and AF signals (computed on all mappable regions) is performed using a bivariate Hidden Markov Model to generate an absolute copy number and a genotype estimate for each segment.\n\nSomatic structural variants (SV) were identified using an in-house tool (crisscross, available at https://github.com/anso-sertier/crisscross) that uses WGS data and two complementary signals from the read alignments: (a) discordant pair mapping (wrong read orientation or incorrect insert-size) and (b) soft-clipping (unmapped first or last bases of reads) that allows resolving SV breakpoints at the base pair resolution. A cluster of discordant pairs and one or two clusters of soft-clipped reads defined an SV candidate: the discordant pairs cluster defined two associated regions, possibly on different chromosomes and the soft-clipped reads cluster(s), located in these regions, pinpointed the potential SV breakpoint positions. We further checked that the soft-clipped bases at each SV breakpoint were correctly aligned in the neighbourhood of the associated region. SV events were then classified as germline or somatic depending on their presence in the matched-normal sample. Results are presented as Supplementary Data 8 and one sample is highlighted in Fig. 3c.\n\nGene-set enrichment analysis of somatic mutations\n\nGene-set enrichment for somatic mutations was assessed independently for each set of Hallmark of cancer genes18 using Fisher’s exact test. We built the contingency tables used as input of the test taking into account genes with multiple mutations and used the fisher.test R function (stats package version 3.4.4). We also included validated mutations (we removed silent and intron/exon mutations) reported in SCLC13. In each group the p-values given by Fisher’s exact test performed for all Hallmarks were adjusted for multiple testing. Supplementary Data 5 lists the altered hallmarks, including the mutated genes and the associated q-value for each group, as well as the mutated genes for each hallmarks present in each supra-carcinoid, cluster LNET, LCNEC, and SCLC samples.\n\nWe performed several robustness analyses to assess the validity of our results, in particular with regards to outlier samples/genes that would have a high leverage on the statistical results, i.e., that would alone drive the significance of a particular hallmark. First, we assessed the leverage of each individual sample using a jackknife procedure (i.e., for each sample, we performed the GSE test after removing this sample). Second, we assessed the leverage of each gene using a jackknife procedure (i.e., for each gene, we performed the GSE test without this gene). We observed that when we removed sample LNEN010 from the cluster LNET B, the sustaining proliferative signalling hallmark enrichment became non-significant at the 0.05 false discovery rate threshold, but was still significant at the 10% threshold (q-value = 0.075; Supplementary Data 3). Similarly, we observed that for several SCLC samples, once the sample was removed, the deregulating cellular energetics and inducing angiogenesis hallmarks became significant at the 0.05 false discovery rate threshold (Supplementary Data 5). For supra-carcinoids samples, we performed GSE for each sample individually. The code used for the gene set enrichment analyses on somatic mutations (Hallmarks_of_cancer_GSEA.R) is available in the Supplementary Software file 1 and the associated results are reported in Supplementary Data 5.\n\nRNA sequencing\n\nRNA sequencing was performed on 20 fresh frozen atypical carcinoids in the Cologne Centre for Genomics. Libraries were prepared using the Illumina® TruSeq® RNA sample preparation Kit. Library preparation started with 1 µg total RNA. After poly-A selection (using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads), mRNA was purified and fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The RNA fragments underwent reverse transcription using random primers. This is followed by second strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis with DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. After end repair and A-tailing, indexing adapters were ligated. The products were then purified and amplified (14 PCR cycles) to create the final cDNA libraries. After library validation and quantification (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer), equimolar amounts of library were pooled. The pool was quantified by using the Peqlab KAPA Library Quantification Kit and the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System. The pool was sequenced by using an Illumina TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 and an Illumina TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer with a paired-end (101x7x101 cycles) protocol.\n\nRNA data processing\n\nThe 210 raw reads files (89 carcinoids, 69 LCNEC, 52 SCLC) were processed in three steps using the RNA-seq processing workflow based on the nextflow language47 and accessible at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/RNAseq-nf (revision da7240d). (i) Reads were scanned for a part of Illumina’s 13 bp adapter sequence ′AGATCGGAAGAGC′ at the 3′ end using Trim Galore v0.4.2 with default parameters. (ii) Reads were mapped to reference genome GRCh37 (gencode version 19) using software STAR (v2.5.2b)54 with recommended parameters55. (iii) For each sample, a raw read count table with gene-level quantification for each gene of the comprehensive gencode gene annotation file (release 19, containing 57,822 genes) was generated using script htseq-count from software htseq (v0.8.0)56. Gene fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) of all genes from the gencode gene annotation file were computed using software StringTie (v1.3.3b)57 in single pass mode (no new transcript discovery), using the protocols from Pertea et al.57 (nextflow pipeline accessible at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/RNAseq-transcript-nf; revision c5d114e42d).\n\nQuality control of the samples was performed at each step. Software FastQC (v. 0.11.5; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) was used to check raw reads quality, software RSeQC (v. 2.6.4) was used to check alignment quality (number of mapped reads, proportion of uniquely mapped reads). Software MultiQC (v. 0.9)58 was used to aggregate the QC results across samples. Concordance between sex reported in the clinical data and sex chromosome gene expression patterns was performed by comparing the sum of variance-stabilised read counts (vst function from R package DESeq2) of each sample on the X and Y chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 28B).\n\nVariant calling on RNA\n\nSoftware Needlestack was also used to call variants on the 20 RNA sequencing data for WES variant validation. Default parameters were used, except for the phred-scaled q-value, minimum median coverage to consider a site, and minimum mapping quality (20, 10, and 13, respectively). The annotation procedure was the same as for WES data.\n\nFusion transcript detection\n\nRNA-seq data was processed as previously described11,13 to detect chimeric transcripts. In brief, paired-end RNA-seq reads were mapped to the human reference genome (NCBI37/hg19) using GSNAP. Potential chimeric fusion transcripts were identified using software TRUP59 by discordant read pairs and by individual reads mapping to distinct chromosomal locations. The sequence context of rearranged transcripts was reconstructed around the identified breakpoint and the assembled fusion transcript was then aligned to the human reference genome to determine the genes involved in the fusion. All interesting fusion-transcript were validated by Sanger sequencing. The code used for the fusion transcript detection is available on https://github.com/ruping/TRUP. All the associated results are presented Supplementary Data 7, and selected genes are highlighted in Fig. 3b.\n\nUnsupervised analyses of expression data\n\nThe raw read counts of 57,822 genes from the 210 samples were normalised using the variance stabilisation transform (vst function from R package DESeq2 v1.14.1)60; this transformation enables comparisons between samples with different library sizes and different variances in expression across genes. We removed genes from the sex-chromosomes in order to reduce the influence of sex on the expression profiles, resulting in a matrix of gene expression with 54,851 genes and 210 samples. We performed four analyses, with different subsets of samples. (i) An analysis with all 210 samples (LNEN and SCLC), (ii) an analysis with LNEN samples only (158 samples), (iii) an analysis with LNET and SCLC samples only (139 samples), and (iv) an analysis with LNET samples only (89 samples). For each analysis, the most variable genes (explaining 50% of the total variance in variance-stabilised read counts) were selected (6398, 6009, 6234, and 5490 genes, respectively, for i, ii, iii, and iv). Principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed independently for each analysis (function dudi.pca from R package ade4 v1.7-8)61. Results are presented in Supplementary Fig. 6; see the Multi-omic integration section of the methods for a comparison of the results of the unsupervised analysis of expression data with that of the other 'omics.\n\nWe used the results from the PCA to detect outliers and batch effects in the expression data set. We did not detect any outliers in any of the analyses from Supplementary Fig. 6. We further studied the association between expression data, batch (sample provider), and five clinical variables of interest (histopathological type, age, sex, smoking status, and stage) using a PCA regression analysis. For each principal component, we fitted separate linear models with each of the six covariables of interest (provider plus the five clinical variables) and adjusted the resulting p-values for multiple testing. Results highlighted an association between principal component 2 and provider, histopathological type, and sex, and an association between principal components 4 and 5 and stage (Supplementary Fig. 30A). The fact that both histopathology and sample provider are jointly significantly associated with PC2 is expected given their non-independence (Supplementary Fig. 29A, B). In order to assess whether there was a batch effect explaining the variation on PC2, we investigated the range of samples from each provider on PC2 (Supplementary Fig. 30B). We can see that samples from Provider 1 and provider 2 span a similar range on PC2 (from values less than –20 to values greater than 40). Restricting the analysis to atypical carcinoids, we can further see that AC samples from provider 2 have a range included in that of provider 1, which is expected given their differing sample sizes (five from provider 2 compared to 20 from provider 1). Overall, this shows that samples from the two providers have similar profiles and can be combined. In addition, we found that the samples that were independently sequenced in a previous study11 and in this study (samples S00716_A and S00716_B, respectively) were spatially close in the PCA (technical replicates highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 30B).\n\nSupervised analysis of expression data\n\nWe performed three distinct differential expression (DE) analyses. (i) A comparison between histopathological types; (ii) A comparison between pulmonary carcinoid (LNET) clusters A1, A2, and B (see Fig. 5a and the Multi-omic integration method section); (iii) a comparison between lung neuroendocrine neoplasm (LNEN) clusters Carcinoid A, Carcinoid B, and LCNEC (see the Multi-omic integration method section).\n\nFor each differential expression (DE) analysis, among the 57,822 genes from the raw read count tables, genes that were expressed in less than 2 samples were removed from the analysis, using a threshold of 1 fragment per million reads aligned. We also removed samples with missing data in the variables of interest (either histopathological types, LNET clusters, or LNEN clusters) or in any of the clinical covariables included in the statistical model (sex and age). This resulted in excluding two samples with missing age data from the three analyses (samples S01093, S02236), and further excluding three samples with no clear histopathological type (classified as carcinoids in Supplementary Data 1) from analysis (i) (samples S00076, S02126, S02154). For each analysis, we then identified DE genes from the raw read counts using R package DESeq2 (v. 1.21.5)60. For each analysis, we fitted a model with the variable of interest (type, LNET cluster, or LNEN cluster) and using sex (two levels: male and female), and age (three levels: (16, 40], (40, 60], (60, 90]) as covariables. We then extracted DE genes between each pair of groups, and adjusted the p-values for multiple testing. In order to select the genes that have the largest biological effect, we tested the null hypothesis that the two focal groups had less than 2 absolute log2-fold changes differences. For each analysis, we define the core genes of a focal group as the set of genes that are DE in all pairwise comparisons between the focal group and other groups; they correspond to genes, which expression level is specific to the focal group. For example, given three groups—A, B, and C—to find core genes, which expression levels uniquely define A compared to both B and C, we select DE genes that differentiate A from B (A vs. B), DE genes that differentiate A from C (A vs. C) and take the intersection of these gene sets [(A vs. B)∩(A vs. C)]. The code used for the DE analyses (RNAseq_supervised.R) is available at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/RNAseq_analysis_scripts. Results of analysis (i) are reported in Supplementary Data 15 and Supplementary Fig. 31; results of analysis (ii) are reported in Supplementary Data 10 and Fig. 5a; results of analysis (iii) are reported in Supplementary Data 12. See section Multi-omics integration for comparisons between the analyses based on histopathological types [analysis (i)] from all ‘omics perspectives.\n\nNote that an alternative method for finding DE genes would be to compare a focal group to all the other samples together. For example, comparing group A to both groups B and C simultaneously [denoted A vs. (B and C) or A vs. the rest]. Note that this would find genes that are DE between A and the average level of expression of B and C, and thus this alternative method would have the unwanted behaviour of including the genes that are strongly DE in the comparison of A vs. B, but with similar expression levels in A and C. In order to compare the methods we used to detect core genes with this alternative method, we performed an analysis similar to analysis (ii) but comparing a focal group to all the other samples simultaneously (A vs. the rest). The comparison between our method and the alternative one is presented in Supplementary Fig. 21 and shows that our analysis provides conservative results compared to testing the focal group vs. the rest. Indeed, core DE genes reported are almost exclusively a subset of the genes found when comparing the focal group vs. the rest.\n\nImmune contexture deconvolution from expression data\n\nWe quantified the proportion of cells that belong to each of ten immune cell types (B cells, macrophages M1, macrophages M2, monocytes, neutrophils, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells, and dendritic cells) from the RNA-seq data using software quanTIseq (downloaded 23 March 2018)62. quanTIseq uses a rigorous RNA-seq processing pipeline to quantify the gene expression of each sample, and performs supervised expression deconvolution in a set of genes identified as informative on immune cell types, using the least squares with equality/inequality constrains (LSEI) algorithm with a reference data set containing expected expression levels for the ten immune cell types. Importantly, quanTIseq also provides estimates of the total proportion of cells in the bulk sequencing that do and do not belong to immune cells.\n\nWe tested whether immune composition differed between histopathological types, LNET clusters, LNEN clusters, and supra-carcinoids using linear permutation tests (R package lmperm, v. 2.1.0). Permutations tests are exact statistical tests that do not rely on approximations and assumptions regarding the data distribution, and are thus well-fitted to test whether a few samples come from the same distribution as a larger group of samples. As such, they were well-fitted to handle the tests involving supra-carcinoids, for which only three samples had RNA-seq data. For each of the three analyses (histopathology, LNET clusters, and LNEN clusters), and for each pair of groups, we fitted one model per immune cell type, with the proportion of this cell type in each sample as explained variable and the cluster membership as explanatory variable. We adjusted the p-values for multiple testing. The code used for these three analyses is available on https://icbi.i-med.ac.at/software/quantiseq/doc/index.html and the associated results are presented Figs. 2f, 4b, and Supplementary Figs. 15, 19, and 32.\n\nEPIC 850k methylation array\n\nEpigenome analysis was performed on 33 typical carcinoids, 23 atypical carcinoids, and 20 LCNEC, plus 19 technical replicates. Epigenomic studies were performed at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) with the Infinium EPIC DNA methylation beadchip platform (Illumina) used for the interrogation of over 850,000 CpG sites (dinucleotides that are the main target for methylation). Each chip encompasses eight samples, so 12 chips were needed for the 95 samples. We used stratified randomisation to mitigate the batch effects, ensuring that the three histopathological types were present on every chip, while also controlling for potential confounders (the sample provider, sex, smoking status, and age of the patient); replicates were placed on different chips.\n\nFor each sample, 600 ng of purified DNA were bisulfite converted using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation-GoldTM kit (Zymo Research Corp., CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations for Infinium assays. Three replicates included half the amount (300 ng). Then, 200 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA was used for hybridisation on Infinium Methylation EPIC beadarrays, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Inc.). This array shares the Infinium HD chemistry (Illumina Inc.) and a similar laboratory protocol used to interrogate the cytosine markers with HumanMethylation450 beadchip. Chips were scanned using Illumina iScan to produce two-colour raw data files (IDAT format).\n\nMethylation data processing\n\nThe resulting IDAT raw data files were pre-processed using R packages minfi (v. 1.24.0)63 and ENmix (v. 1.14.0)64. We first removed unwanted technical variation in-between arrays using functional normalisation of the raw two-colour intensities, and computed the β-values for the 866,238 probes and 96 samples. Then, we filtered four types of probes that could confound the analyses. (i) We removed probes on the X and Y chromosomes, because we were interested in variation between tumours and treated sex as a confounder. (ii) We removed known cross-reactive probes—i.e., probes that co-hybridise to other chromosomes and thus cannot be reliably investigated. (iii) We removed probes that had failed in at least one sample, using a detection p-value threshold of 0.01, where p-values were computed with the detection P function from R package minfi, that compares the total signal (methylated + unmethylated) at each probe with the background signal level from non-negative control probes. (iv) We removed probes associated with common SNPs—that reflect underlying polymorphisms rather than methylation profiles—using a threshold minor allele frequency of 5% in database dbSNP build 137 (function dropLociWithSnps from minfi). (v) We removed probes putatively associated with rare SNPs by detecting and removing probes with multimodal β-value distributions (function nmode.mc from R package ENmix). Next, we removed duplicated samples, randomly choosing one sample per pair so as to minimise potential discrepancies, and we removed one sample that came from a metastatic tumour rather than a primary tumour. The final data set contained the β-values of 767,781 CpGs for 76 samples.\n\nWe performed quality controls of the raw data. Two-colour intensity data of internal control probes were inspected to check the quality of successive sample preparation steps (bisulfite conversion, hybridisation). We did not find outliers when comparing the methylated/unmethylated channel intensities of all samples, nor did we find samples with overall low detection p-values (the sample with the lowest mean p-value had a value of 0.001). Concordance between the sex reported in the clinical data and the methylation data was assessed using a predictor based on the median total intensity on sex-chromosomes, with a cutoff of –2 log2 estimated copy number (function getSex from minfi). Consistently with the WES and RNA-seq data, we found one sample with a mismatch between reported and inferred sex (see results in Supplementary Fig. 28C). We investigated batch effects at the raw data level using surrogate variable analysis. We used function ctrlsva from package ENmix to compute a principal component analysis of the intensity data from non-negative control probes. We retained the first ten principal components—hereafter referred to as surrogate variables—explaining >90% of the variation in control probes intensity. The ten surrogate variables were included as covariables in later supervised analyses to mitigate the impact of batch effects on the results. We checked the association of surrogate variables with batch (chip, position on the chip, and sample provider) and clinical variables (histopathological type, age, sex, smoking status) using PCA regression analysis, fitting separate linear models to each surrogate variable with each of the seven covariables of interest and adjusted the p-values for multiple testing. We show in Supplementary Fig. 33A that surrogate variables 1, 2, 3, and 10 are significantly associated with the chip (variable Sentrix id) or position on the chip (variable Sentrix position), while surrogate variables 4, 5, and 10 are significantly associated with the sample provider. The code used to perform all the pre-processing procedure of these data is available at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/Methylation_analysis_scripts.\n\nUnsupervised analysis of methylation data\n\nThe β-values of 767,781 CpGs for 76 samples were transformed into M-values to perform unsupervised analyses; indeed, contrary to β-values, M-values theoretically range from −∞ to +∞ and are considered normally distributed. We performed two analyses, with different subsets of samples: (i) an analysis with all carcinoid and LCNEC samples (76 samples), and (ii) an analysis with carcinoid samples only (56 samples). For each analysis, the most variable CpGs (explaining 5% of the total variance in M-values) were selected (8,483 and 7,693 CpGs, respectively, for (i) and (ii). PCA was then performed independently for each analysis (function dudi.pca from R package ade4 v1.7-8)61. Results are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7; see the Multi-omic integration section of the methods for a comparison of the results of the unsupervised analysis of methylation data with that of the other 'omics.\n\nWe used the results from the PCA to detect outliers and batch effects in the methylation data set. We did not detect any outliers in any of the analyses from Supplementary Fig. 7. We also performed a PCA regression analysis using the same protocol as described in the data processing section above. Results highlighted no association between any principal component and array batches (chip and position in the chip; Supplementary Fig. 33A). Principal component 2 was associated with the sample provider; further examination of the PCA (Supplementary Fig. 33B) revealed that this effect was driven by the samples from provider 1, which have the largest range of coordinates on PC2 (from < –30 to >100). Nevertheless, the fact that their coordinates on PC2 overlap with that of samples from other providers, and the fact that the vast majority of atypical carcinoid samples come from one provider, suggest that the large range of values of provider 1 samples on PC2 is driven by the biological variability of carcinoid methylation profiles. In addition, note that samples that cluster with LCNEC are not solely from provider 1. We assessed the impact of functional normalisation on batch effects by performing the same analysis on the M-values of the 5% most variable CpGs obtained without normalisation (Supplementary Fig. 33A). Compared to the PCA of the 5% most variable CpGs with normalisation (Supplementary Fig. 33A), we find that the chip position (variable Sentrix position) is significantly associated with PC10, and that PC2 is not associated with histopathology. This suggests that the functional normalisation reduced batch effects and revealed some of the biological variability in methylation data.\n\nThe PCA is also informative about associations between methylation profiles and clinical variables. We find a significant association between PC1, histopathological type, age, and smoking status, with LCNEC, smokers, and larger age classes located at higher PC1 coordinates (Supplementary Fig. 33A); these associations are expected, given that the difference between LCNEC and carcinoids is expected to be the main driver of variation in methylation, and given known the aetiology of the diseases8. We find an association between principal component 2, histopathology, and sex, with male and atypical carcinoids having overall larger PC2 coordinates. We find associations of larger components, in particular PC3 and age, and PC7 and 9, and sex.\n\nSupervised analysis of methylation data\n\nWe detected differential methylation at the probe level (DMP) in three independent analyses: (i) between histopathological types (TC, AC, and LCNEC), (ii) between LNET clusters (clusters A1, A2, and B), and (iii) between LNEN clusters (clusters A, B, and LCNEC).\n\nTo detect DMPs, for each analysis, linear models were first fitted independently for each CpG to its M-values (function lmFit from R package limma version 3.34.9)65, using the variable of interest (histopathology, LNET cluster, or LNEN cluster), in addition to the sex, age group, and the ten surrogate variables as covariables. Then, moderated t-tests were performed by empirical Bayes moderation of the standard errors (function eBayes from package limma), and p-values were computed for each CpG. Moderation enables to increase the statistical power of the test by increasing the effective degrees of freedom of the statistics, while also reducing the false-positive rate by protecting against hypervariable CpGs, and are thus favoured in array analyses. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing, and CpGs with a q-value <0.05 were retained. The code used for the DMPs identification (DMP.R) is available in the Supplementary Software 1 and the associated results of analyses (i), (ii), and (iii) are presented Supplementary Data 16, Supplementary Data 11, and 17, respectively. See section Multi-omics integration for comparisons between the analyses based on histopathological types [analysis (i)] from all ‘omics perspectives. Analysis (iii) confirmed most DMPs associated with DEGs reported in Fig. 5a for cluster B relative to LNET clusters (TFF1, OTOP3, SLC35D3, APOBEC2) were also DMPs for cluster B relative to LNEN clusters, showing that they harboured specific methylation levels that made them different from the LCNEC cluster, as well as from other carcinoid clusters.\n\nMulti-omics integration\n\nWe performed an integrative analysis of the WES, WGS, RNA-seq, and 850 K methylation array data, using the validated somatic mutations (Supplementary Data 4), the variance-stabilised read counts, and the M-values, respectively. The full data set consisted of 243 samples, but some analyses focused on a subset of the data.\n\nUnsupervised continuous multi-omic analyses\n\nTo perform continuous latent factors identification, we performed an integrative group factor analysis of the expression and methylation data using software MOFA (R package MOFAtools v. 0.99)15. MOFA identifies latent factors (LF, i.e., continuous variables) that explain most variation in the joint data sets. We did not include the somatic mutations in the model because the low level of recurrence (only four recurrently mutated genes in Supplementary Data 4) resulted in a sample by mutation matrix of much lower dimension than the other ‘omics, which is known to bias the analyses15. Also, we did not consider expression and methylation from the sex-chromosomes, because we were interested in differences between tumours independently of the sex of the patient.\n\nWe performed four analyses, with different subsets of samples. (i) An analysis with all 235 samples for which expression or methylation data was available (LNEN and SCLC), (ii) an analysis with LNEN samples only (183 samples), (iii) an analysis with LNET and SCLC samples only (163 samples), and (iv) an analysis with LNET samples only (111 samples). For each analysis, the most variable genes for expression (explaining 50% of the total variance) were selected (6398, 6009, 6234, and 5490 genes, respectively, for i, ii, iii, and iv), and the most variable CpGs (explaining 5% of the total variance) were selected (8483, 8483, 7693, and 7693 CpGs, respectively, for i, ii, iii, and iv). Note that these lists of genes and CpGs are the same as the ones used to perform the unsupervised analyses of expression and methylation data (see above sections). Also note that we did not have EPIC 850k methylation array data for SCLC; MOFA was shown to handle missing data, including samples with entire ‘omic techniques missing, by using the correlated signals from several data sets (e.g., expression and methylation) to accurately reconstruct latent factors. MOFA was performed independently for each analysis, setting the number of latent factors to 5, because subsequent latent factors explained <2% of the variance of both ‘omic data sets (function runMOFA from R package MOFAtools v0.99.0). Because MOFA uses a heuristic algorithm, we assessed the robustness of the results using 20 MOFA runs. We then computed the correlations between each of the five first-latent factors across each run, resulting in a correlation matrix of 100 by 100 entries (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 17). We found that the correlations across runs were very high (> 0.95 for >80% of runs) in all analyses, suggesting that the results are robust. In addition, we found that correlations between latent factors within runs were small (typically below 0.2), which suggests that latent factors capture quasi-independent sources of variation in the data sets. For each analysis, we selected the MOFA run that resulted in the best convergence, based on the evidence lower bound statistic (ELBO). Results are presented in Figs. 1a, 4a, and Supplementary Fig. 13. Interestingly, we find that MOFA latent factors 1 to 3 for analysis (i) (LNET, LCNEC, and SCLC) correspond to MOFA LF2 to 4 for analysis (ii) (LNET and LCNEC), and to MOFA LF3 to 5 for analysis (iv) (LNET alone); this suggests that each histopathological type introduces an independent source of variation, resulting in a new LF. The code used for the unsupervised continuous molecular analyses (integration_MOFA.R) is available on https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/integration_analysis_scripts.\n\nTo perform comparisons with uni-omic unsupervised analyses, we compared the results of MOFA with that of the unsupervised analysis of expression and methylation data (Supplementary Fig. 3). To do so, we used the 51 LNEN samples for which we had both expression and methylation data, and extracted their coordinates in MOFA, expression PCA (see section unsupervised analysis of expression data), and methylation PCA (see section unsupervised analysis of methylation data). When using LNET and LCNEC samples (Supplementary Fig. 3A), we found that MOFA LF1 is strongly correlated with expression PC1 and methylation PC1 (|r| > 0.98; Supplementary Fig. 3D, E), and that expression PC1 and methylation PC1 are strongly correlated between them (r = 0.97; Supplementary Fig. 3C); LF2 was strongly correlated with expression PC3 (r = –0.86; Supplementary Fig. 3P), and methylation PC2 (r = –0.98; Supplementary Fig. 3K), suggesting that LF2 is more driven by methylation differences, but that it is nonetheless consistent with a large proportion of expression variation. On the contrary, LF3 was more strongly correlated with expression PC2 (r = 0.87; Supplementary Fig. 3J), suggesting that PC3 is more driven by expression differences. All these observations are consistent with the fact that the percentage of variance explained by LF2 and LF3 in terms of expression and in terms of methylation are different: LF2 explains more expression in methylation, while LF3 explains more variation in expression (Fig. 1a); it is also coherent with the fact that clusters A1 and A2 are the most separated clusters on expression PC2 (Supplementary Fig. 6B), while clusters A1 and B are the most separated on methylation PC2 (Supplementary Fig. 7A). When using LNET samples only (Supplementary Fig. 3B), we found that MOFA LF1 is strongly correlated with expression PC2 and methylation PC1 (|r| > 0.86; Supplementary Fig. 3M, H), and that expression PC2 and methylation PC1 are strongly correlated between them (r = 0.72; Supplementary Fig. 3F); LF2 was strongly correlated with expression PC1 (r = –0.88; Supplementary Fig. 3G), and methylation PC2 (r = 0.90; Supplementary Fig. 3N), suggesting that LF2 is more driven by methylation differences, but that it is nonetheless consistent with a large proportion of expression variation. Again, all these observations are consistent with the fact that the percentage of variance explained by LF1 and LF2 in terms of expression and in terms of methylation are different (Fig. 4a); it is also coherent with the fact that clusters A1 and A2 are the most separated clusters on expression PC1 (Supplementary Fig. 6D), while clusters A1 and B are the most separated on methylation PC2 (Supplementary Fig. 7B).\n\nTo perform associations of latent factors with other variables, we used the results from MOFA to detect outliers and batch effects in the data set. We did not detect any outliers in any of the analyses from Supplementary Fig. 13. We further studied the associations between the first 5 LFs, batch (sample provider), and five clinical variables of interest (histopathological type, age, sex, smoking status, and stage) using regression analysis. For each latent factor, we fitted a linear model with the six covariables of interest (provider plus the five clinical variables). Because of the reported association between sex, age, and smoking status, we also included in the model the interaction between sex and smoking status and between age and smoking status; we adjusted the resulting p-values for multiple testing. Significant associations (q-value < 0.05) are highlighted in Figs. 1a and 4a.\n\nWe also tested the association between MOFA clusters and mutations using regression analysis. We tested genes recurrently mutated in carcinoids, using a threshold of three samples (following Argelaguet et al.)15; indeed, non-recurrent genes are not informative about molecular groups. Only two genes were retained: MEN1 and EIF1AX. We also included recurrently mutated genes reported in LCNEC12. Results are highlighted in Fig. 4a. Similarly, we tested the association between pathways highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 16 (Lysine demethyltransferases, polycomb complex, SWI/SNF complex) and MOFA LF using regression analysis, but did not find any significant association at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05.\n\nUnsupervised discrete multi-omic analyses\n\nWe identified molecular clusters—groups of samples with similar molecular profiles—from MOFA results. Following Mo et al.66, given a specified number of clusters K, we used the K – 1 latent factors that explained most of the variation to perform clustering; this choice of number of latent factors in Mo et al.66 is said to be primarily motivated by “a general principle for separating g clusters among the n datapoints, a rank-k approximation where k ≤ g − 1 is sufficient.” In addition, because the MOFA latent factors explaining the most variance in gene expression and methylation are expected to capture more biological signal compared to the ones explaining the least variance—expected to represent more of the noise in the data set—we expect that using the first K – 1 latent factors would provide more biologically meaningful clusters than using all latent factors. In addition, following the procedure from Wilkerson and Hayes67, we performed consensus clustering to detect robust molecular clusters. This procedure involved multiple replicate clusterings (K-means algorithm; R function kmeans), each on latent factors from an independent MOFA run done on a subsample (80%) of the data. Pairwise consensus values were defined as the proportion of runs in which two samples are clustered together and used as a similarity measure, and used to perform a final hierarchical clustering (median linkage method). Consensus clustering results for K from 2 to 5, for LNET plus LCNEC samples, and LNET samples alone, are presented in Supplementary Figs. 5 and 18, respectively. In the case of LNET alone, because the optimal Dunn index, which evaluates the quality of clustering as a ratio of within-cluster to between-cluster distances, corresponded to K = 3 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 18C), we chose the solution with three clusters. Nevertheless, note that the cluster memberships for K = 4 and K = 5 are almost perfectly nested into that for K = 3 (e.g., samples from the blue cluster for K = 3, Supplementary Fig. 18B are split between a blue and a purple cluster for K = 4), so the solutions with three and four clusters are coherent. Cluster memberships are highlighted in Fig. 4a. Similarly, in the case of LNET plus LCNEC samples (LNEN), because the optimal Dunn index is reached when K = 3, we chose that solution, but note that the cluster memberships for K > 3 are also nested into that for K = 3, so all results are coherent across values of K.\n\nIn order to test whether using additional latent factors could increase the power to detect molecular clusters, we performed a similar analysis but using all five latent factors identified by MOFA. In order to provide more importance to the factors most likely to capture the biological variation in the data, the multiple replicate clusterings were performed using a weighted k-means algorithm, where variables (here MOFA latent factors) are given weights corresponding to their proportion of variance explained. More specifically, instead of minimising the within-cluster sum of squares, the weighted within-cluster sum of squares is minimised. Results for K = 3 clusters of LNET and LNEN samples are presented in Supplementary Fig. 8. We can see that the alternative approach (weighted K-means on five latent factors) leads to the exact same cluster membership as the original approach (K-means on K – 1 latent factors), both for LNEN and LNET clusters. Indeed, among the latent factors, only the first 3 were associated with either the LNEN clusters (ANOVA q = 4.09 × 10−84, 8.63 × 10−80, 0.66, 0.094, 0.24, respectively, for latent factors 1 through 5) or the LNET clusters (ANOVA q = 5.06 × 10−4, 5.99 × 10−47, 5.12 × 10−46, 0.15, 0.052, respectively), which indicates that the first three latent factors captured the differences between clusters. The code used for the clustering analyses (integration_unsupervised.R) is available at https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/integration_analysis_scripts.\n\nGSEA on multi-omic latent factors\n\nWe performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the latent factors identified by MOFA using the built-in function FeatureSetEnrichmentAnalysis15. This tests for each latent factor whether the distribution of the loadings of features (genes or CpGs) from a focal set are significantly different from the global distribution of loadings from features outside the set. We performed the analysis using two reference databases of gene sets: GO and KEGG. To retrieve the appropriate databases, for all genes from the muti-omics integration analysis, we downloaded GO terms using R package biomaRt68, and we retrieved KEGG pathways using R package KEGGgraph (v. 1.38.0)69. Results are presented in Supplementary Data 6.\n\nExpression and methylation correlation analysis\n\nWe performed correlation tests in two analyses: (i) between LNET clusters (clusters A1, A2, and B), and (ii) between LNEN clusters (clusters A, B, and LCNEC). We selected for each gene, the set of CpGs in the region −2000 to +2000 from the transcription start site (TSS) using function getnearestTSS from R package FDb.InfiniumMethylation.hg19 version 2.2.0 based on the IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 annotation (get Annotation function from R package minfi version 1.24.0)63.\n\nWe performed correlation test analyses (function cor.test from R package stats version 3.5.1) using the core genes lists (Supplementary Data 10 and 12) to find associations between expression and methylation data for each CpG, using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing. In addition, we explored the correlation between expression and methylation data by fitting a linear model independently for each correlated CpG (function lm from R package stats version 3.5.1). Finally, we calculated the interquartile distance of β-values for each CpG. CpGs with a q-value < 0.05, r2 > 0.5 and an interquartile distance greater than 0.25 were retained and, among these CpGs, only the one with the smallest q-value has been represented in Supplementary Fig. 22. Results of analyses (i) and (ii) are reported in Supplementary Data 10 and 12.\n\nSurvival analysis using penalised generalised linear model\n\nWe computed a generalised linear model with elastic net regularisation (R package glmnet v2.0-16)70 to select the genes associated with the survival of LNET samples. We fixed the elastic net mixing parameter α to 0.5 and used leave-one-out cross-validation to determine the regularisation parameter λ (cv.glmnet function from glmnet package). To be more stringent, the optimal regularisation parameter chosen was the one associated with the most regularised model with cross-validation error within one standard deviation of the minimum. In order to identify the genes associated with the poor survival of the cluster Carcinoid B, we included in the model only the expression of the core genes of this cluster defined in the MOFA considering only the LNET samples (see section Multi-omics integration). We used the normalised read counts, and centred and scaled them using R package caret (v6.0-80). The genes with non-zero estimated coefficients are listed in Supplementary Data 13. For each non-coding gene, we determined the optimal cutpoint of expression (normalised read counts) that best separates the survival outcome into two groups using the surv_cutpoint function based on the maximally selected rank statistics and available in the R package survminer (v0.4.3). The minimal proportion of samples per group was set to 10%.\n\nSupervised multi-omic analyses\n\nWe performed supervised learning in order to classify typical and atypical carcinoids, and LCNEC based on the different 'omics data available: expression and methylation data.\n\nClassification algorithm: Each classification was performed using a random forest algorithm (R package randomForest v4.6-14). Considering the restricted number of samples, we performed a leave-one-out cross-validation. For each run, to increase the training set size, minority classes were oversampled so that all classes reach the same number of training samples. Note that for the sample with technical replication of RNA-seq data (S00716_A and S00716_B), in order to avoid model overfitting, the two replicates were never simultaneously included in the training and test sets. Also in order to avoid overfitting, we performed normalisation and independent feature filtering within each fold, so that test samples were excluded from this step. More specifically, for the expression data, the features of the training set were first normalised using the variance stabilisation transformation (vst function from R package DESeq2 v1.22.2), then mean-centred and scaled to unit variance. Then, the variance stabilising transformation learned from the training set was applied to the test set using the dispersionFunction function from the DESeq2 package, and centreing and scaling were performed using the values learned from the training set. For the methylation data, the M values were computed using the R package minfi (v1.28.3); the features of the training set were mean-centred and scaled to unit variance, then the test sample features were centred and scaled using the values learned from the training set. For each fold of the leave-one out, the training set was used for the feature selection. Based on the training set, we selected the most variable features, representing 50% and 5% of the total variation in expression and methylation data, respectively. The code used for the machine learning analyses (ML_functions.r) is available in the Supplementary Software 1 and the associated results are reported in Supplementary Data 1.\n\nDefining an Unclassified category: The random forest algorithm provides for each predicted sample the class probabilities. We considered a sample as unclassifiable (Unclassified category) if the ratio of the two highest probabilities was below 1.5. In fact, this threshold allowed us to identify a category of samples with intermediate molecular profiles, for which the algorithm assigns similar probabilities to the two most probable classes. Because of the small sample size, this parameter was chosen a priori and not tuned in order to avoid overfitting. In Supplementary Fig. 10, we compared the classification results when considering three different thresholds: 1 (which corresponds to no ratio and results in few unclassified samples, i.e., only discordant expression and methylation-based predictions, see Integration of expression and methylation data below), 1.5 (which corresponds to the ratio reported in the main text), and 3 (which corresponds to a very stringent ratio resulting in more unclassified samples). Except for the size of the unclassified classes that depends on the ratio used, the confusion matrices for the three ratios were qualitatively similar, with most LCNEC samples correctly classified, a majority of typical correctly classified, and almost as many atypical classified as typical and classified as atypical. In addition, the survival analyses of the three models also led to similar conclusions, with atypical carcinoids classified as atypical by the machine learning having a survival that is not statistically significantly different from that of LCNEC samples but that is lower from both that of typical carcinoids predicted as typical carcinoids, and that of atypical predicted as typical. However, in the case of the largest ratio, the small number of atypical samples predicted in those categories did not enable the identification of two groups of atypical carcinoids with significant different overall survival (p = 0.086).\n\nNumber of samples and features: To classify LCNEC against atypical and typical carcinoids, 157 and 76 samples were considered using the expression and methylation data, respectively. The number of features selected in each fold of the leave-one-out are of the order of 6000 and 8000 for expression and methylation features, respectively. For the analysis based on MKI67 only (Supplementary Fig. 31C, left panel), the only feature considered was the expression of MKI67.\n\nIntegration of expression and methylation data: As the random forest algorithm does not handle missing data directly, and because only 51 out of 182 LNEN samples had both expression and methylation data available (Supplementary Fig. 1), we performed random forest classification on expression and methylation separately, and merged the classification results by combining the two sets of ML predictions. Thus, the samples with both expression and methylation data were associated with two predictions. When the two predictions were discordant we applied the following rules: (i) if one prediction was Unclassified (see Defining an Unclassified category above) and the other a histopathological category, we chose the histopathological category (ii) if the two predictions were different histopathological categories, we chose the Unclassified category.\n\nNote that fitting independent random forest models on each data set separately corresponds to maximising the number of samples (n) per model at the expense of the number of features (p), because each model relies only on the number of features in a single data set. An alternative approach is to maximise the number of features (p) by combining both data sets, at the expense of the number of samples n, because of the limited number of samples with both data types available. Indeed, for fixed n increasing p requires less parameters and leads to a higher statistical power. Nevertheless, in our case, because of missing data, increasing p by using both omics layers would drastically reduce n, restricting our sample set (n = 157 and n = 76 for expression and methylation, respectively) to the set of samples with both layers (n = 51, including only a single supra-carcinoid). Given the existence of very rare entities such as the supra-carcinoids, accurately capturing the diversity of molecular profiles in the training set was our priority, and thus we chose to maximise n. In addition, by maximising n, we hypothetically ensured that we would also maximise the power of the subsequent analyses based on the ML results. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed the ML analyses on the restricted set of samples, including both expression and methylation data in the same model and compared the predictions of this model to the combined predictions based on expression and methylation data separately. We found that the predictions (confusion matrix in Supplementary Fig. 9) were similar, with 43/51 samples with both data types predicted similarly in the two models. In addition, our main finding—the existence of two groups of atypical samples, which tended to have a good and bad prognosis (red and pink curves Fig. 1b)—still held, but that limited number of samples impeded the statistical analyses. In fact, none of the Cox regression tests were significant even for the groups displaying the largest differences (e.g., ML-predicted LCNEC vs. ML-predicted typical samples), and even when comparing the histological types reported by the pathologists (bottom panel Supplementary Fig. 9). This supports our hypothesis that maximising p at the expense of n leads to a decrease in power in subsequent analyses due to a smaller sample size, and comforts our initial choice.\n\nAs matrix factorisation methods such as MOFA and PCA remove correlations between features by finding latent factors that summarise them, they could presumably improve the performance of ML. Nevertheless, by providing low-dimensional approximations of the data, such techniques induce a loss of information, which could reduce the performance of the ML. To assess the balance between these beneficial and detrimental effects, we also performed ML using the MOFA factors or the principal components of the PCA analysis, using factors or components that explained at least 2% of the variance (five MOFA latent factors, six expression PCs, and five methylation PCs, respectively). These analyses are presented in Supplementary Fig. 12 and led to similar classification to the results presented in the main text Fig. 1. In addition, in the case of MOFA factors, in accordance with Fig. 1, atypical carcinoids were stratified into a group with an overall survival similar to that of the LCNEC (in red) and a group with a higher overall survival (in pink), similar to that of the typical carcinoids. When using the principal components, despite a similar trend, the difference in survival between the high- and low-survival groups was not significant. These results show that dimensionality reduction does not lead to an increased classification ability, nor does it provide a better explanation of clinical behaviour. We thus chose to represent only the results of the ML analyses based on expression and methylation data in the main text and figures.\n\nSurvival analysis based on expression and methylation data\n\nWe divided the samples into different groups based on the ML predictions. We represented the Kaplan–Meier curves of the predictions groups by selecting the groups with >10 samples and gathering the unclassified samples in the same group. Using Cox’s proportional hazard model and using the logrank test statistic (R package survival v2.42-3) we compared the overall survival of LCNEC, atypical and typical samples based on the histopathological classification and based on the ML predictions (Supplementary Fig. 11A). Forest plots were drawn using R package survminer (v0.4.3). The same survival analysis was performed using the ML predictions based on MKI67 expression only (Supplementary Fig. 11C).\n\nComparison between the supervised analyses of typical and atypical carcinoids\n\nWe contrasted the results of the different supervised analyses between typical and atypical carcinoids based on clinical data, specific markers (Ki67), machine learning, differential expression, and differential methylation (Supplementary Fig. 31). Survival analyses showed a significant difference between histopathological types (Supplementary Fig. 31A). Nevertheless, the machine learning classifier based on the genome-wide expression or methylation data could not properly distinguish atypical and typical carcinoids (Supplementary Fig. 31B): there were 64–83% correctly classified typical carcinoids and only 30–41% correctly classified atypical carcinoids. The differential expression analysis showed that atypical carcinoids also presented very few core differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 31C, middle panel and Supplementary Data 15) and differentially methylated positions (Supplementary Fig. 31C, right panel and Supplementary Data 17). Overall, these data suggest that the histopathological classification, although clinically meaningful, does not completely match the molecular classification.\n\nReporting summary"
