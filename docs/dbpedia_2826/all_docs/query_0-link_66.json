        "text": "The Lillehammer region is located in the Gudbrandsdalen valley in Eastern Norway, around two hours north of Oslo. It is known for the 1994 Olympic Winter Games and from the Netflix series Lilyhammer.\n\nWith mountains, rivers and Norway’s largest lake nearby, it is an ideal place for outdoor activities. Get some great insider tips on things to do here!\n\nIn summer, you can go hiking, horseback riding, and rafting. When temperatures drop, snow-covered slopes and prepared cross-country tracks await. Many of the Olympic arenas are still open to the public – you can even try bobsleighing!\n\nTaste local delicacies and check out museums and cultural centres like Maihaugen. If you’re travelling with children, a visit to the Hunderfossen Adventure Park is a must.\n\nLillehammer has achieved the certification Sustainable Destination. Although this does not mean that the destination is sustainable, it does mean that it has made a commitment to work systematically to reduce the negative effects of tourism, while strengthening its positive ripple effects.\n\nFind more inspiration on Lillehammer’s official website."
