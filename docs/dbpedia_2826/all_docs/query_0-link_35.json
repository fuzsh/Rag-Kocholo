        "text": "For the first post of 2024 on this humble blog; I want to wish all my many friends, family, readers, and other supporters a very happy new year of 2024!\n\nFollow me below the fold for some uplifting and entirely appropriate music for this brave new year. Along with the obligatory commentary and musings on the year that was.\n\nSo, it’s coming up on that time of year again. The time of year when people are supposed to be just a little bit nicer to each other. A time when magic is in the air and miracles happen. Yes, it’s coming up on Christmas time, again.\n\nAnd I’m struggling to feel the magic. Again.\n\nToday we are once again forced into saying “Goodbye” to a musical legend. Singer, dancer, actress, and author, known as the “Queen of Rock and Roll,” Tina Turner has passed at age 83. She leaves behind a legacy in music as “one of the greatest singers of all time.”\n\nFor approximately two billion people here on planet Earth, today is their New Year’s celebration. Otherwise known as “Chinese New Year,” “Asian New Year,” or “Lunar New Year,” today a whole lot of people are welcoming the Year of the Rabbit.\n\nOnce again, just like turning the pages of a calendar, we’re out with the old year and in with the new. But, maybe we don’t want to celebrate the end of 2022 too loudly. I mean, 2022 was a better year than 2021. But that’s like comparing drinking arsenic to drinking hemlock.\n\nSo, lets go quietly into the New Year while remembering the year that was.\n\nThere’s many uniquely American traditions around Thanksgiving day. One of those is of course, eating a large bird known as “turkey,” as the centerpiece of the dinner. Along with the eating part of Thanksgiving comes the social events like the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. We also have some other notable events real and fictional in television and music.\n\nOne of these most notable fictional events involved dropping turkeys out of helicopters.\n\nSo once again we’ve entered the zone between space and time. When people cry out in anguish for stability and normalcy. A time when people rise up as one and wearily wander through their homes looking at their clocks, resigned to their fates. Wondering which are true and which yet need to be adjusted.\n\nYes, I’m talking about daylight savings time. A time when, twice each calendar year (which doesn’t ever change) we all go around our homes resetting our clocks and watches and other means of telling the time. A moment when we all ask “What time is it?” Because we’re not sure which clocks haven’t yet been changed.\n\nAs a news junkie who righteously follows current events, this week is already taking on a surrealistic feel. It’s only Wednesday, yet already information is swirling through massive shifts of multiple data streams coalescing into a tight vortex of infinite probabilities.\n\nWhich leads me to believe it’s break time for some serious acid rock music."
