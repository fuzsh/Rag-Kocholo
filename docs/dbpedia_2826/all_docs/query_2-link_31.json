Our aim was to evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning during acute ischemic stroke (<6 h) reduces brain infarct size at 24 h.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients have been included at eleven French Stroke centers, within 6 h of symptom onset with MRI-confirmed carotid ischemic stroke (NIHSS: 5–25). Patients have been randomized 1:1 to lower limb remote ischemic per-conditioning or sham group. Remote ischemic per-conditioning consists of four cycles of electronic tourniquet inflation (5 min) and deflation (5 min) to a thigh within 6 h of symptom onset. Randomization has been stratified on IV thrombolysis. Mechanical thrombectomy was allowed. MRI was repeated 24 h after stroke onset. The design has been published in Int J Of Stroke.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 200 patients have been randomized (97 in the experimental arm and 103 in the sham arm). Mean age was 67.2 years (SD: 15.7), 52% were male, mean NIHSS score on admission was 11.3 (SD: 5.6), 87% received IV thrombolysis and 39% have been treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Main results will be presented at the session.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe RESCUE BRAIN trial will inform on whether or not remote ischemic per-conditioning reduces final infarct size in acute ischemic stroke patients with pharmacological and/or mechanical recanalization strategies.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nThe ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02189928\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02189928\"}}NCT02189928.

This study evaluated whether an enhanced care pathway delivered by trained paramedics (the Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA)) could increase the proportion of patients receiving IVT.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design: Multicentre cluster RCT.\n\nSetting: Three regional NHS ambulance services and 15 hyperacute stroke units across England and Wales.\n\nRandomisation: Ambulance stations within each region were the unit of randomisation; paramedics based at stations delivered the PASTA pathway (intervention) or continued with standard stroke care (control).\n\nStudy intervention: The PASTA pathway included additional pre-hospital information collection regarding IVT eligibility, systematic pre-notification, structured hospital handover; and assistance with simple tasks at hospital.\n\nStudy control: Standard stroke care.\n\nParticipants: Adults with confirmed stroke who were assessed by a study paramedic within 4 hours of onset.\n\nPrimary outcome: Proportion of participants receiving IVT.\n\nSecondary outcomes include: Stroke severity and complications post IVT; mortality; dependency at discharge and 90 days; time intervals including time to scan and IVT.\n\nSample size: To detect a 10% difference in proportion of IVT treatments, it was estimated that 1297 participants were required. However, the final target was adjusted as some of the underlying assumptions altered during the study.\n\nResults\n\nFrom December 2015 to July 2018, 1272 participants were enrolled. Final follow up data were collected in November 2018. The main results will be available for presentation at ESOC in 2019.\n\nConclusions\n\nn/a\n\nTrial registration number\n\nISRCTN12418919\n\nAS04-008\n\nTAKING CHARGE AFTER STROKE: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A PERSON-CENTRED, SELF-DIRECTED, REHABILITATION INTERVENTION IN COMMUNITY STROKE SURVIVORS\n\nV.

Take Charge significantly improved independence and health-related quality of life in Māori and Pacific New Zealanders following stroke. We tested the same intervention in a larger study and in a broader population with stroke.\n\nMethods\n\nWe randomised 400 people within 16 weeks of acute stroke, discharged to institution-free community living at seven centres in New Zealand to a single Take Charge session (TC1, n = 132), two Take Charge sessions 6 weeks apart (TC2, n = 138) or a control intervention (n = 130). The primary outcome was the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) at 12 months following stroke, comparing any Take Charge intervention to control. The outcomes assessor was masked to allocation.\n\nResults\n\nTwelve months following stroke, participants in either of the TC groups (ie TC1 + TC2) scored 2.9 (95% CI 0.95 to 4.9, p = 0.004) points higher (better) than control on the SF36 PCS and this difference remained significant when adjusted for pre-specified baseline variables. There was a dose effect with SF36 PCS scores increasing by 1.9 points (95% CI 0.8 to 3.1, p < 0.001) for each extra Take Charge session received. Some secondary outcomes were also significantly better for intervention groups than control at six and 12 months following stroke.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Take Charge session – a simple, low cost, self-management intervention, improved health-related quality of life at 12 months following stroke.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nACTRN12615001163594\n\nAS04-020\n\nROBOT ASSISTED TRAINING FOR THE UPPER LIMB AFTER STROKE (RATULS): MAIN RESULTS\n\nH.

The RATULS trial is the largest trial to date to determine whether robot-assisted training improves upper limb function post-stroke.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design: A pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, cost analysis and process evaluation.\n\nStudy setting: Four study centres, each consisting of a hub hospital with an InMotion robotic gym system and adjacent primary and secondary care spoke sites.\n\nStudy participants: Adults with acute or chronic first ever stroke (1 week to 5 years post-stroke) causing moderate to severe upper limb functional limitation.\n\nStudy treatments: There are three randomisation groups:\n\ni. Robot-assisted training using the InMotion robotic gym system delivered for 45 minutes, three times per week for 12 weeks.\n\nii. Enhanced upper limb therapy delivered for 45 minutes, three times per week for 12 weeks.\n\niii. Usual NHS care.\n\nRandomisation: Central independent web based service.\n\nPrimary outcome: Upper limb function measured by the Action Research Arm Test at 3 months.\n\nSecondary outcomes: Upper limb impairment, activities of daily living, quality of life, resource use and adverse events measured at 3 and 6 months.\n\nBlinding: Outcomes assessments by blinded assessor.\n\nParallel process evaluation: Semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants and staff.\n\nSample size: 762 participants.\n\nResults\n\nFrom April 2014 to April 2018, 770 participants from 4 study centres were randomised. Intervention delivery was completed in July 2018 and final follow up data were collected in October 2018. The main results will be available for presentation at ESOC in 2019.\n\nConclusions\n\nN/A\n\nTrial registration number\n\nISRCTN69371850\n\nAS02-032\n\nCOMBINED USE OF CONTACT ASPIRATION AND THE STENT RETRIEVER TECHNIQUE VERSUS STENT RETRIEVER ALONE FOR RECANALIZATION IN ACUTE CEREBRAL INFARCTION: THE RANDOMIZED ASTER2 TRIAL\n\nB.

Combined Contact aspiration (CA) with SR is a new promising treatment.\n\nWe aim to ascertain whether the combined use of CA and SR is more efficient than SR alone as a first-line endovascular treatment.\n\nMethods: With a two-sided test (alpha = 5%, power = 80%) and an anticipated rate of spontaneous recanalization and catheterization failures of 20%, we estimated that a sample size of 408 patients would be necessary to detect an absolute difference of 15% in primary outcome (superiority design).\n\nThe ASTER2 trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end-point clinical trial.\n\nPatients admitted with suspected anterior circulation ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion, with onset of symptoms < 8 hours, were randomly assigned to treatment with combined CA and SR or SR alone in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe primary outcome is the rate of perfect reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] score 2c/3) at the end of the endovascular procedures. Major secondary outcomes include procedural outcomes, intracerebral hemorrhage at 24-hours, the modified Rankin Scale and all-cause mortality at 90-days.\n\nResults\n\nNo previous head-to-head randomized trials have directly compared the efficacy of combined use of CA and SR versus SR alone.\n\nThis prospective trial aims to provide further evidence of the synergistic effects of CA and SR devices in first-line endovascular treatment.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe final results of the ASTER2 Trial will be presented at the ESOC 2019.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nIdentifier {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03290885\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03290885\"}}NCT03290885\n\nPresidential Symposium – Awards & Trials\n\nAS16-021\n\nBURDEN OF STROKE IN EUROPE: 30-YEAR PROJECTIONS OF INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, DEATHS AND DALYS IN EU COUNTRIES\n\nH.

Separate projection models by age and sex groups were developed for 28 EU countries to estimate trends in incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs rates. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) suggested exponential regressions to provide the best fit. Adjustments were made for two distal predictors: time, capturing medical advances effect; and gross domestic product per capita (GDP), indicating the impact of economic development. Future trajectories were based on the United Nations’ population projections and the World Bank’s GDP prospects.\n\nResults\n\nIn 2017, 1·12 million cases of incident stroke took place in the EU, 9·53 million prevalent cases, 0·46 million deaths, and 7·06 million DALYs lost. By 2047, there will be an additional 40,000 incident cases and 2·58 million prevalent cases. Conversely, there will be 80,000 fewer deaths and 2·31 million fewer DALYs. Largest increase in the age-adjusted incidence and prevalence rates are expected in Lithuania (14·4% and 21% respectively), whereas greatest reductions are estimated in Portugal (–47·2% and –39·4%). Change in mortality rates will range from –2·5% (Lithuania) to –85·9% (Estonia), and DALYs’ from –7% (Romania) to –83·5% (Estonia).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe number of people with stroke is estimated to increase by 27% between 2017 and 2047 in the EU. Improved life expectancy and prevention strategies will result in increased prevalence/burden of stroke in Europe, particularly in Eastern European countries.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS02-028\n\nTHE ENHANCED CONTROL OF HYPERTENSION AND THROMBOLYSIS STROKE STUDY (ENCHANTED): THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ALTEPLASE DOSE AND BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERING TREATMENT\n\nX. Wang1, J. Chalmers1, T. Robinson2 and C. Anderson1\n\n1The George Institute for Global Health, Neurological and Mental Health department, Sydney, Australia\n\n2University of Leicester, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Leicester, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nHigh blood pressure (BP) is present in 75% of patients with acute stroke, but there has been longstanding uncertainty over how best to treat high BP during the acute period after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) when thrombolysis treatment is being considered. The Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) study is an international, quasi-factorial randomized controlled trial involving a package of 2 linked comparative treatment arms, the first of which was to assess the effects of low-dose compared with standard-dose alteplase, while the second arm was to examine the effects of early intensive BP lowering. Post-hoc analyses from alteplase dose arm shows that patients with lower baseline BP benefits more from low-dose alteplase. We aim to assess the relation of randomized BP lowering treatment effects by altepalse dose interaction.\n\nMethods\n\nThe ENCHANTED BP arm compared a strategy of intensive (systolic BP [sbp] 130–140 mmHg) versus guideline-recommended (SBP < 180 mmHg) BP lowering in 2227 thrombolysis-treated AIS patients for superiority with respect to shift (‘improvement’) in 90-day modified Rankin score and the safety outcome of any sICH. The main results will be presented at the International Stroke Conference in February 2019. Logistic regression will be performed for analysis of patient subgroups defined by altepalse dose (low vs. standard) on efficacy and safety outcomes. The heterogeneity of BP lowering treatment effect between subgroups will be estimated by adding an interaction term to the statistical model.\n\nResults\n\nData will be presented on how altepalse dose modifies differences in effects of intensive- versus standard-BP lowering treatment.\n\nConclusions\n\nN/A\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS01-030\n\nINTERACT2/ATACH-II IPD POOLING PROJECT TO DEFINE OPTIMAL LEVELS OF SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL IN ACUTE INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE\n\nT.

Primary outcome was functional recovery (90-day ordinal mRS scores). Safety outcomes were neurologic deterioration and symptomatic hypotension within 24 hours, and serious adverse events within 90-days. Data presented are with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nResults\n\nAmong 3,829 participants (mean age 63 years, 37% female, 65% Asian) in these analyses, achieved SBP was associated with the primary outcome (aOR per 10 mmHg increase: 0.90, 95% CI 0.87–0.94, p < 0.0001). Positive linear associations existed for levels of achieved SBP and SBP variability with neurologic deterioration, death, and any serious adverse event. Symptomatic hypotension and renal serious adverse events were uncommon (<1%). Trends toward unfavourable outcomes were evident with a large reduction in SBP (≥60 mmHg) within one hour.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur unified analytical approach indicates that achieving and sustaining lower SBP are associated with favorable outcomes in acute ICH.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nINTERACT2 [{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00716079\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00716079\"}}NCT00716079]/ATACH-II [{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01176565\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01176565\"}}NCT01176565]\n\nAS24-030\n\nTHE TRANEXAMIC ACID FOR INTRACEREBRAL HAEMORRHAGE-2 (TICH-2) TRIAL: RESULTS OF ONE YEAR FOLLOW UP DATA\n\nZ.K.

Sprigg1; the TICH-2 investigators\n\n1University of Nottingham, Stroke Trials Unit, Nottingham, United Kingdom\n\n2UKM Medical Centre, Department of Medicine, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nThe Tranexamic acid for IntraCerebral Haemorrhage-2 (TICH-2) trial reported no significant improvement in functional outcome (shift in modified Rankin Scale) at day 90 despite reduction in haematoma expansion and early death (day 7). However, significant recovery after stroke, particularly intracerebral haemorrhage may take more than 3 months. Here we will report the participant outcomes one year after stroke.\n\nMethods\n\nThe TICH-2 was a prospective randomised controlled trial that tested the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage when given within 8 hours of onset. Centralised blinded telephone follow up was performed for patients from the United Kingdom at Day 365. Outcome assessments included modified Rankin Scale, Barthel index, Telephone Interview Cognitive Status-modified, EuroQoL-5D and Zung Depression Scale.\n\nResults\n\n2325 patients were recruited into the trial (age 68.9 ± 13.8 years; 1301 male, 56%). 1910 participants (82.2%) were eligible for day 365 follow up. 120 patients (6.3%) were lost to follow up. There was no significant difference in proportion of death in tranexamic acid or placebo group (260, 28% vs 276, 29%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0–65.05; p = 0.11). Tranexamic acid did not reduce the risk of poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale >3; OR 1.01, 95% CI 0–80.28; p = 0.95). However, Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed significant survival benefit in the tranexamic acid group (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0–70.99; p = 0.038; figure).\n\nConclusions\n\nTranexamic acid did not significantly improve functional outcome but improved survival at one year in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nEudraCT number 2012–004108-37\n\nAS25-052\n\nDISENTANGLING THE INFLUENCE OF ATRIAL SEPTAL ANEURYSM AND SHUNT SIZE ON THE RISK OF RECURRENT STROKE ASSOCIATED WITH PATENT FORAMEN OVALE\n\nG.

We assessed the respective influence of shunt size and ASA status on stroke recurrence under medical therapy in patients with recent PFO-associated stroke without alternative cause.\n\nMethods\n\nWe pooled individual patient data from two prospective observational studies and the medical arms of two randomized trials, in which shunt size and ASA status was assessed by independent reading of echocardiography images. Associations between PFO anatomical features and recurrent ischemic stroke were assessed by mixed effects Cox models.\n\nResults\n\nOf 894 patients (mean age 45.4 years), 188 (21%) had ASA plus large PFO, 58 (6.5%) ASA without large PFO, 418 (46.8%) large PFO without ASA and 230 (25.7%) non-large PFO without ASA. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 (IQR = 2–8.7) years, 47 (5.3%) patients experienced a recurrent stroke. There was no evidence of a synergistic effect between ASA and shunt size regarding stroke recurrence (Pinteraction = 0.29). In a model accounting for age, hypertension, antithrombotic therapy and PFO anatomy, ASA was independently associated with recurrent stroke (adjusted HR = 3.56, 95% CI:1–94.52; P < 0.0001), while large shunt was not (adjusted HR = 1.62, 95% CI:0–75.50; P = 0.22).\n\nConclusions\n\nIn patients with PFO-associated stroke, ASA is a more important predictor of recurrent stroke than shunt size. These results can help to better identify those patients with a high risk of stroke recurrence under medical therapy, who may derive the most benefit from PFO closure.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nNA\n\nAS26-011\n\nBLOOD PRESSURE OVER THE LIFE COURSE AND LATER-LIFE COGNITION IN BLACKS, HISPANICS, AND WHITES (BP-COG): POOLED COHORT ANALYSIS OF ARIC, CARDIA, CHS, FOS, AND NOMAS\n\nD.

We hypothesized that higher blood pressure (BP) levels explain race-ethnic differences in cognitive decline.\n\nObjective\n\nDetermine associations between BP over the life course and cognitive decline in blacks, Hispanics, and whites.\n\nMethods\n\nWe pooled 20,385 participants 18 and older free of stroke and dementia across 5 longitudinal cohorts from 1971 to 2017: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Framingham Offspring Study (FOS), and Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS). The primary outcome was change in global cognitive performance (GCP) harmonized across all cohorts. Mean follow-up was 13.5 + 8.0 years.\n\nResults\n\nCompared with whites, blacks had significantly faster, and Hispanics significantly slower, declines in GCP (Model A, Table 1). After adjusting for time-dependent cumulative mean systolic BP, black-white differences in cognitive decline attenuated, but Hispanic-white differences in cognitive decline did not (Model B). Further adjustment for antihypertensive medication use did not change the race-ethnic differences in cognitive decline (Model C).\n\nConclusions\n\nBlacks’ higher BP levels and worse control over the life course contribute to black-white differences in cognitive decline. We found no evidence that BP disparities explain Hispanic-white differences in cognitive decline.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS09-012\n\nCEREBRAL MICROBLEEDS AND FUTURE STROKE RISK AFTER ISCHAEMIC STROKE OR TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK: POOLED ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DATA FROM COHORT STUDIES\n\nD. Werring1; on behalf of The Microbleeds International Collaborative Network\n\n1PhD FRCP FESO, Stroke Research Centre- UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nCerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a promising biomarker of increased intracranial haemorrhage risk after ischaemic stroke (IS) or TIA, but whether they might identify patients at risk of net harm from antithrombotic therapy is unknown.\n\nMethods\n\nIn an individual patient data pooled analysis, we determined the association of CMBs with intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and IS risk using multivariable Cox regression, adjusted for pre-specified prognostic variables. We developed and validated stroke risk prediction models including CMBs.\n\nResults\n\nIn 20,322 individual patients from 38 cohorts (with over 35,000 patient-years (median 1.98 years) follow-up), CMBs were associated with increased adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CI) of all-stroke (1.39 (1–24.56)), ICH (2.56 (1–89.47)), and IS (1.27 (1–10.45)). As CMB burden increased, the HR rose more steeply for ICH (for ≥5 CMBs, HR 4.86 (3–27.23)) than IS (for ≥5 CMBs, HR 1.53 (1–23.90)). CMB distribution had little effect on HRs. However, regardless of CMB burden or distribution, the absolute rate of IS exceeded that of ICH (e.g. for ≥10 CMBs, rate 64 (48-84) per 1000 patient-years vs. 27 (17-41) per 1000 patient-years, respectively). Findings were similar in patients taking antiplatelet drugs or oral anticoagulants. Risk prediction models including CMBs showed good discrimination for ICH (C-index 0.71 (0–62.79)) and IS (C-index 0.65 (0–59.69)).\n\nConclusions\n\nCMBs are associated with a greater hazard ratio for ICH than IS; predictive models have good discrimination. However, the absolute risk of IS is consistently much higher than that of ICH, suggesting that CMBs do not identify patients at risk of net harm from antithrombotic use.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nLarge Clinical Trials 2\n\nAS09-001\n\nCILOSTAZOL VS ASPIRIN IN ISCHEMIC STROKE WITH CEREBRAL MICROBLEEDS VS PRIOR INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE: SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL\n\nK.S.

We explored a treatment-by-underlying cerebral hemorrhage-prone lesion interaction.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a post hoc analysis of PICASSO. Patients were divided into the CMBs and prior ICH subgroups. The primary safety endpoint was the time to first occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage (ICH or subarachnoid hemorrhage). The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first occurrence of composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.\n\nResults\n\nOf 1512 patients, 903 (59.7%) had multiple CMBs and 609 (40.3%) had prior ICH. The risk of cerebral hemorrhage was lower with cilostazol vs aspirin (0.12%/year vs 1.49%/year; hazard ratio [HR], 0.08 [95% CI 0–01.60]; p = 0.015) in the CMBs subgroup, but was not different (1.26%/year vs 0.79%/year; HR, 1.60 [0–52.90]; p = 0.408) in the prior ICH subgroup. The interaction of treatment-by-hemorrhagic prone lesion was significant (Pinteraction = 0.011). For the composite of major vascular events, there was a trend toward a lower risk with cilostazol vs aspirin (3.56%/year vs 5.53%/year; HR, 0.64 [0–41.01]; p = 0.056) in the CMBs subgroup, but was comparable (5.21%/year vs 5.05%/year; HR, 1.03 [0–63.67]; p = 0.913) in the prior ICH subgroup. There was no significant interaction (Pinteraction = 0.165).\n\nConclusions\n\nIn ischemic stroke with multiple CMBs, cilostazol might be a better option over aspirin with a lower risk of cerebral hemorrhage and a trend of reduced risk of major vascular events.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01013532\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01013532\"}}NCT01013532\n\nAS03-032\n\nEFFECTS OF RIVAROXABAN VS ASPIRIN ON THE OCCURRENCE OF CLINICAL AND MRI-DEFINED INFARCTS AND MICROBLEEDS IN NAVIGATE ESUS – RESULTS OF NAVIGATE MIND MRI SUBSTUDY\n\nM.

Participants were recruited from 80 sites in 15 countries and imaged on 1.5T or 3T scanners. Incident infarcts and microbleeds were ascertained by trained readers blinded to treatment assignment and characterized by location and size.

Across all stimulation doses, benefit on the primary outcome, improvement beyond expectations on the 90d mRS, was 49.6% vs 39.9%, p = 0.0258. Dose-response analysis revealed a strong dose effect (p = 0.0006) with an inverted-U shape (medium-intensity better than low or high).(Figure) Among the 25% of patients receiving stimulation in the optimum (medium) intensity range, benefit was substantially magnified (68.9% vs 39.9%, p < 0.0001). Similar dose-response curves were seen for all 4 prespecified secondary efficacy endpoints: functional independence (mRS 0–2), self-care or better (mRS 0–3), improved stroke-specific-quality of life (SIS-16), and degree of disability (UW-mRS). (Table)\n\nConclusions\n\nSPG stimulation improved the outcome of acute ischemic stroke patients with confirmed cortical infarction in a strongly dose-dependent manner. A simple stimulation protocol has been developed that reliably achieves optimum dose delivery for clinical implementation.\n\nTrial registration number\n\n{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00826059\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00826059\"}}NCT00826059\n\nWITHDRAWN\n\nAS02-031\n\nVESSEL OCCLUSION DOES NOT MODIFY TREATMENT EFFECT OF INTRAVENOUS ALTEPLASE IN THE WAKE-UP TRIAL\n\nJ.

In this pre-planned subgroup analysis, we studied whether VO modified treatment effect of intravenous alteplase in the WAKE-UP trial.\n\nMethods\n\nIn the WAKE-UP study, patients with DWI-FLAIR mismatch regardless of vessel occlusion were randomized to either alteplase or placebo treatment within 4.5 h of symptom recognition. VO was determined on baseline MR angiography (MRA). We compared clinical and imaging parameters as well as treatment effect on the primary endpoint (modified Rankin Scale 0–1 at 90 days) between patients with and without VO.\n\nResults\n\nIn the intention-to-treat population of 503 patients, 485 patients had MRA of diagnostic quality and 185 (32%) presented with VO at baseline. Strokes were more severe, median NIHSS 9 (IQR 5–15) versus 5 (IQR 3–7) and baseline DWI lesion volumes were bigger (mean volume 15 ml SD 17 ml versus 3 ml SD 7 ml) in the VO group. The intervals between symptom recognition and treatment did not differ between patients with and without VO. There was no interaction of VO and treatment effect (p = 0.56). Among patients with VO, 30/94 (31.9%) alteplase treated patients had good clinical outcome (mRS 0–1) as compared to 18/91 (19.8%) placebo treated patients (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.2; p = 0.05).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe presence of a VO did not modify the treatment effect of intravenous alteplase in WAKE-UP. Although WAKE-UP was not powered to demonstrate treatment efficacy in subgroups, intravenous alteplase appears to result in better functional outcome in patients with VO than placebo.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nClinicalTrials.gov number {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01525290\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01525290\"}}NCT01525290\n\nAS02-070\n\nPRACTISE TRIAL: PENUMBRA AND RECANALISATION ACUTE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IN ISCHAEMIC STROKE EVALUATION\n\nS.

However, industry independent, real world data remains limited within this still evolving field.\n\nMethods\n\n2,794 patients treated with EVT for large vessel occlusion in ischemic stroke have been included into an academic, independent, prospective, multicenter register in 25 participating sites in Germany between June 2015 and April 2018. All patients received EVT as per standard of care. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months after EVT. Secondary outcomes included reperfusion success measured by the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale. After a central data quality control, 2611 patients entered the final analysis.\n\nResults\n\nMedian age was 75 years (IQR 65–82) and median NIHSS score before EVT was 15 (IQR 10–19). Vessel occlusion was located in the anterior circulation in 88%. Successful reperfusion (TICI 2b/3) was achieved in 83%. After 3 months, 26% (568/2237) of the patients showed an excellent outcome (mRS 0–1) and 37% (822/2237) a good outcome (mRS 0–2); mortality was 29% (640/2237). Functional outcome was comparable between anterior and posterior circulation but strongly associated with stroke severity (NIHSS) and reperfusion success (TICI) (see figure).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis large registry trial demonstrates high rates of reperfusion and favorable outcome after EVT in clinical routine for both anterior and posterior circulation large vessel strokes.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03356392\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03356392\"}}NCT03356392\n\nAS06-039\n\nINTRAVENOUS TROMBOLYSIS DOES NOT DELAY TIME TO ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT, SUBSTUDY RESULTS FROM THE MR CLEAN REGISTRY\n\nW.

EVT alone may be more effective, as prior IVT may cause a delay in EVT initiation and may increase the risk of hemorrhage. We sought to determine the effect of prior IVT on time to treatment and risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated with EVT.\n\nMethods\n\nWe analyzed data from the MR CLEAN Registry, a prospective, multicenter, observational study in the Netherlands and included patients with an anterior circulation occlusion treated with EVT who presented directly to intervention centers between March 2014 and June 2016. Primary endpoint was door to groin time (DGT). Secondary outcomes were workflow time intervals and safety outcomes. We log-transformed time intervals, adjusted for baseline factors and used linear and ordinal regression models.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 665 patients of which 500 (75%) were treated with EVT+IVT. Adjusted DGT was similar in both groups with a 2.1% difference (95% CI: -5.4 – 9.1) in favor of EVT only. Door to CT times were reduced in the EVT+IVT group (32.6% difference, 95% CI: 21.3 – 42.2), while CT to groin times were increased (11.0% difference, 95% CI: 0.2 – 19.8) and DSA more often showed no treatable target occlusion (10.5% versus 2.3%, p = 0.010). Rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were similar for both groups.\n\nConclusions\n\nPrior intravenous thrombolysis does not delay time to endovascular treatment and does not seem to increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS06-056\n\nBRIDGING THERAPY VERSUS DIRECT MECHANICAL THROMBECTOMY IN ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE PATIENTS WITH LARGE VESSEL OCCLUSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS\n\nG.

In unadjusted analyses BT was associated with higher likelihood of three-month functional independence (mRS-scores 0–2; OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30-1.75), three-month functional improvement (cOR for 1-point decrease in mRS-score = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.18-1.97). BT was also related to lower likelihood of three-month mortality (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73), with no significant differences in the risks of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.77-1.14). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with higher likelihood of three-month functional independence (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.25-1.92) and lower odds of three-month mortality (adjusted OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65-0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in in functional improvement (adjusted cOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.89-1.74) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.61-1.25).\n\nConclusions\n\nBT appears to be associated with improved functional independence and no safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS02-064\n\nTHROMBECTOMY IN ANDALUCIA USING ASPIRATION (TRIANA) VS STANDARD STENTRIEVER: POTENCY AND QUICKNESS OF THE THERAPY\n\nA.

Therefore, we compare capacity and quickness of Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (ADAPT) vs stentriever, in order to be able to adjust to the resources of our health system.\n\nMethods\n\nWe design a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized study in patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke, large vessel occlusion and less than 8 hours of evolution treated with endovascular rescue techniques: ADAPT using SOFIA® catheter in comparison with the stentriever.\n\nResults\n\nOf 532 patients, 370 (69.5%) were treated with ADAPT and 162 (30.5%) with stentriever as first choice. For primary outcome, the proportion of patients with successful revascularization was 93.5% in ADAPT vs 80.2% in stentriever (p = 0.003). When another treatment was not required (76.5% in aspiration, 95.7% in stentriever), in ADAPT group lower number of passes were needed: 1 (IQR: 1–2) vs 2 (IQR: 1–3) stentriever (p < 0.01), and intervention was faster: median 19 vs 60 min stentriever. Whereas in all patients in whom aspiration was used, 30.8% TICI 3 rate was achieved in first pass; when a rescue technique was not necessary, TICI 3 improved to 40.4% (12.9% and 13.5% respectively for stentriever, p < 0.01). If performing a rescue treatment was not required, a better outcome at 3 months was achieved in aspiration group: mRS 1 (IQR: 0–3) vs mRS 2 (IQR: 1–5) (p = 0.003).\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough further randomized clinical trials are needed, ADAPT could be quicker and more resolutive when another technique is not required.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03407092\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03407092\"}}NCT03407092\n\nAS07-098\n\nMEDICAL MANAGEMENT VERSUS MECHANICAL THROMBECTOMY FOR MILD DEFICITS STROKES: INTERNATIONAL MULTICENTER STUDY AND META-ANALYSIS\n\nN.

We sought to evaluate outcomes of MT in comparison to best-medical-management (bMM) in mELVO patients.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 251 anterior circulation mELVO (MT: 138, median NIHSS 4, bMM: 113, median NIHSS 3) presenting within 24 hours were reviewed and compared. A meta-analysis of studies reporting outcomes of MT in comparison to bMM was conducted.\n\nResults\n\nThe bMM group had a lower rate of asymptomatic ICH (4.6% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.002) compared to the MT group. After imputation of missing data, the univariable-analysis showed higher rates of 3-months functional-independence in the bMM group (mRS 0–2: 88.5% vs. 77.4%, p = 0.021) but in multivariable analyses, this difference was non-significant. Otherwise the two groups did not differ in terms of 3-months FFO (favorable-functional-outcome: mRS 0–1), sICH, or 3-month-mortality. In multivariable-analyses, MT was associated with higher odds of asymptomatic ICH (OR 4.13, 95% CI; 1.50-11.40, p = 0.006), but was not related to sICH, 3-month functional outcomes or mortality. Five studies (890 patients) met the inclusion criteria of our meta-analysis. The odds of sICH were higher in the MT arm when compared with the bMM group (OR 5.22,95% CI; 1.85-14.72, p = 0.002), however this difference failed to reach significance in adjusted analyses. Otherwise, the MT and bMM groups did not differ in terms of mortality, 3-month FFO, and 3-month FI.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur study suggests no improvement in functional-outcomes in mELVO patients receiving MT compared to bMM.

However, the optimal treatment for these ‘carotid I-occlusions’ is not known. We aimed to investigate the results of endovascular treatment (EVT) compared to conservative treatment in patients with carotid I-occlusions.\n\nMethods\n\nWe compared EVT-treated patients with carotid I-occlusions from the MR CLEAN Registry to non-EVT-treated patients from our center. CT angiography images were reviewed on occlusion pattern, collateral structures, and plexus enhancement. Our primary outcome was 90-day functional independence (mRS 0–2). Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality and delta-NIHSS.\n\nResults\n\nTwenty-nine patients received EVT and nine patients did not. IVT was administered in 79% (23/29) in EVT-treated patients versus 67% (6/9; p = 0.66) in non-EVT-treated patients. Median baseline NIHSS was 12 versus 16 (p = 0.21). Functional independence occurred in 52% (14/27) versus 22% (2/9) in the respective groups (aOR 0.48;95% CI 0.1-3.4). Mortality for EVT versus non-EVT treated patients was 19% (5/27) versus 33% (3/9)(aOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.1-9.8). Respective median delta-NIHSS was 7 (IQR1-9) versus 8 (IQR4-11)(b0.1; 95% CI -3.9-7.3). Patency of the anterior choroidal artery, anterior communicating artery, posterior artery, and plexus enhancement were positively related with functional independence.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur data suggest improved outcomes in carotid I-occlusion patients treated with EVT, similar to other patients in the thrombectomy trials. Good collateral flow with a patent middle cerebral artery is no reason to refrain from EVT in acute stroke due to carotid I-occlusion.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS23-049\n\nRECANALISATION TREATMENT IN CHILDHOOD AND YOUNG ADULT STROKE – COMPARISON OF SAFETY AND OUTCOME\n\nU.

However, it remains unknown if these treatments are as safe and effective as in adult AIS patients. This study aimed to compare safety and outcome of IVT/EVT in children and young adults with AIS.\n\nMethods\n\nRetrospective study (01/2000–12/2017) of patients aged 1 month – 45 years treated with IVT/EVT for AIS. Clinical and radiological data of children (1 month – 16 years) were compared to young adults (>16 years – 45 years) by univariate analysis. Delayed treatment initiation was defined >4.5 hours and >6 hours after symptom onset for IVT and EVT respectively. Outcome was assessed using the mRS 3–6 months after AIS.\n\nResults\n\n19 children (age 11 +/- 3.9 years, 6 (31.6%) females) and 175 adults (age 36 +/- 8.1 years, 85 (48.6%) females) were included. Overall, children showed different etiologies (P = 0.001) and lower recanalisation rates (p = 0.019), whereas initial pedNIHSS, bleeding complications, mortality and outcome did not differ between the two groups. Comparing IVT to EVT, children receiving IVT showed a higher initial pedNIHSS (p = 0.003), delayed treatment initiation (p = 0.001) and worse outcome (p = 0.003) compared to adults treated with IVT. No major differences were observed in children and adults treated with EVT.\n\nConclusions\n\nSafety and outcome of recanalization treatment in children is comparable to findings observed in young adults.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase.\n\nMethods\n\nWithin-trial economic analysis of the EXTEND-IA TNK randomised controlled trial (RCT) was performed alongside long-term modelled cost-effectiveness analysis. The trial evaluation included costs relating to the index emergency department and inpatient stroke hospitalisation, rehabilitation/subacute care and rehospitalisation due to stroke within 90 days. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated using utility scores derived from the modified Rankin Score (mRS) at Day 90. In the modelled economic evaluation, a Markov model with seven health states corresponding to seven mRS scores was adopted to simulate the patient outcomes and costs for the lifetime. Model parameters including resource use, unit cost and utility weights were sourced from published literature or government websites.\n\nResults\n\nIn the RCT, the total cost was nominally lower in the tenecteplase-treated patients (AUD64,539) compared to alteplase-treated patients (AUD71,473). Tenecteplase was the dominant treatment strategy in the short-term, with lower cost (AUD-7302, 95% CI: -27048-12444, p = 0.469) and higher benefits (QALY 0.099, 95% CI: 0.001- 0.1967, p = 0.048). In the long-term, tenecteplase was associated with less cost (AUD37,761 vs AUD42,050) and greater benefits (QALY 7.18 vs 5.99), and had a probability of 100% being cost-effective.\n\nConclusions\n\nBoth within trial and long-term economic analyses showed that tenecteplase was highly likely to be cost-effective for acute stroke patients prior to thrombectomy.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS07-035\n\nPREDICTORS OF SELF-REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER STROKE THROMBECTOMY\n\nM.

Thomalla1\n\n1University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Neurology, Hamburg, Germany\n\n2University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Neuroradiological Diagnostics and Intervention, Hamburg, Germany\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated improved outcome in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) treated by endovascular thrombectomy (ET) compared to standard medical care. However, little is known about self-reported quality of life (QoL) in these patients. We assessed whether the treatment benefit in patients with ET ascertained by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days in prior RCTs is also reflected in QoL of these patients.\n\nMethods\n\nIn a single-center prospective study we collected data from stroke patients with LVO treated by ET. Baseline characteristics, procedural and outcome parameter were evaluated. Health-related QoL was measured by the European QoL-five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) utility index (ranging from –0.594 to 1, higher values indicate better QoL) three months after stroke. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better QoL.\n\nResults\n\nFour hundred thirty-five patients were included in the study (median age: 76 years, 52% female), median baseline NIHSS was 15. Successful recanalization (defined by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score ≥ 2b) was achieved in 73%. Mean EQ-5D utility index was 0.38 [SD 0.44]. A lower age (p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.023), lower pre-stroke mRS (p = 0.001), lower baseline NIHSS score (p < 0.001), higher ASPECT score (p < 0.001), concomitant IVT (p = 0.032) and a successful recanalization (p < 0.001) were associated with better QoL.\n\nConclusions\n\nPredictors of better health-related quality of life after stroke thrombectomy closely match the predictors of better functional outcome in these patients that were identified in previous trials.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nScientific Communications 02-Epidemiology\n\nAS16-035\n\nTEMPORAL TRENDS IN STROKE INCIDENCE IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY: POPULATION-BASED STUDY AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW\n\nL. Li1, C.A. Scott1, P.M. Rothwell; On behalf of the Oxford Vascular Study1\n\n1Centre for Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nPopulation-based studies provide most reliable data on stroke incidence. A previous systematic review of population-based studies suggested that stroke incidence in high-income countries decreased by 42% between the 1970s and early 2000s. However, it is uncertain whether this trend of steady decline has been maintained in more recent periods.\n\nMethods\n\nAll published population-based stroke incidence studies that reported temporal trends of stroke incidence since 1990 in high-income countries were included along with unpublished data from the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC; 2002–2017). Age-standardised relative incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for each study and then pooled with inverse variance weighted random effects meta-analysis.\n\nResults\n\nOf 12 population-based studies from 9 high-income countries, 30,321 incident stroke cases occurred during 17,903,041 person-years of observation. Despite variation in age-standardised absolute stroke incidence rates between studies, stroke incidence declined steadily between the 1990s and 2010s within each study, resulting in a 23% decline over an average period of 16 years (7 studies; pooled IRR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.83, p < 0.0001). The trend was the same for men (6 studies; 0.72; 0.63-0.82, p < 0.0001) and for women (6 studies; 0.71; 0.63-0.79, p < 0.0001), and remained consistent after year 2010 in OXVASC. Proportion of disabling or fatal stroke also decreased over time (2 studies; early vs. later period 53.6% vs. 46.1%, OR = 0.77, 0.62-0.96, p = 0.02). However, no decrease was observed for individuals aged < 55 years (6 studies; 1.03, 0.82-1.30, p = 0.79).\n\nConclusions\n\nStroke incidence is continuing to decline with steady rate in Oxfordshire and in other high-income settings. However, no decrease is observed at younger ages.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS16-039\n\n20-YEAR TIME TRENDS IN LONG-TERM CASE-FATALITY AND RECURRENCE RATES AFTER ISCHEMIC STROKE STRATIFIED BY ETIOLOGY – RESULTS FROM THE POPULATION-BASED ERLANGER STROKE PROJECT\n\nV.

We investigated time trends in ischemic stroke case-fatality and recurrence rates from 1996–2015 stratified by etiological subtype within a population-based stroke register in Germany.\n\nMethods\n\nData was collected within the Erlangen Stroke Project, a prospective, population-based stroke register covering a population of 105,164 inhabitants (2010). Time trends for case-fatality and recurrence rates up to 5-years after index event were estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression. We adjusted for age, sex and year of event and stratified for etiological subtypes according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification.\n\nResults\n\n3,343 patients with first ischemic stroke were included; age-standardized incidence per 100,000 was 75.8 in women and 131.6 in men (2015). Overall, 1-year and 5-year survival probabilities were 75.9% and 50.4% in women and 82.8% and 59.2% in men; 5-year survival was highest in patients with stroke due to small-artery occlusion (women: 71.8%; men: 75.9%) and lowest in cardioembolic stroke (women: 35.7%; men: 47.8%). 1-year and 5-year recurrence rates were 7.5% and 21.1%; 5-year recurrence rate was lowest in women in stroke due to small artery occlusion (16.0%) and in men in large-artery atherosclerosis (16.6%); highest risk of recurrence was observed in undefined strokes (women: 22.3%; men: 21.4%). Cox regression revealed improved case-fatality rates over time. No statistically significant time trends were observed for stroke recurrence.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong-term survival and recurrence varied by stroke etiology. Survival probabilities improved, but no major trends in recurrence rates were observed.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS16-022\n\nLONG-TERM TRENDS IN MORTALITY AND DEPENDENCE AFTER ISCHAEMIC STROKES: PROSPECTIVE POPULATION STUDY OF THE SOUTH LONDON STROKE REGISTER\n\nH.

IS was classified into large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardio-embolism (CE), small-vessel occlusion (SVO), other determined aetiologies (OTH), and undetermined aetiologies (UND). Using proportional-hazards survival modelling, adjusted for demographic factors and case mix variables, we examined temporal trends in one-year mortality rates. Additional regression analyses explored whether trends occurred at the expense of greater functional dependence (Barthel index < 15) among survivors.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 3,128 patients with first ISs were registered. Risk-adjusted rates of one-year mortality decreased from 30·1% in 2000–2003 to 22·8% in 2012–2015 (adjusted hazard ratio per year, 0·97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0·96 to 0·99; P = 0·0002 for trend). Improvements were noted in all IS subtypes and ethnic groups, however, were only significant in CE and UND and in those of white ethnic origins. Functional dependence has decreased between 2000–2003 and 2012–2015 at seven days poststroke (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0·61; 95% CI, 0·44 to 0·84) but not at one-year poststroke (OR, 1·15; 95% CI, 0·8 to 1·64).\n\nConclusions\n\nBoth mortality and functional dependence after ISs have decreased during the past 16 years in association with improvements in the acute processes of care. Reductions in mortality are particularly evident in CE and UND subtypes and in the white population.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS19-028\n\nPRESENCE, DURATION, AND CONTROL OF VASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND INTRACRANIAL STENOSIS: THE NORTHERN MANHATTAN STUDY (NOMAS)\n\nJ.

Participants who remained stroke-free had a brain MRA between 2003 and 2008. During the interval between enrollment and the brain MRI, participants were assessed annually for vascular risk evaluation. Intracranial stenosis categorized as no stenosis, < 50%, 50–80% and > 80% stenosis. We used fixed effects from adjusted hierarchical generalized linear models to examine the relationship between vascular risks and intracranial stenosis.\n\nResults\n\n1029 participants (58% women, 63% Hispanic, mean age 64 ± 8 years were followed for an average of 7 years (IQR 5–9). Forty percent had intracranial stenosis. Any intracranial stenosis was associated with older age (B = 0.04, P < 0.001) and with vascular risks at enrollment (hypertension B = 0.55, P = 0.002; diabetes B = 0.62, P < 0.001; dyslipidemia B = 0.63, P = 0.02) but not with incident vascular risks during follow-up. Intracranial stenosis was associated with repeated measures of systolic blood pressure (B = 0.11 per 10 mmHg increment, P = 0.005), fasting glucose (B = 0.05 per 10 mg/dl increment, P = 0.03), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (B = 0.04 per 10 mg/dl increment, P = 0.03) and lifetime pack-years of smoking (B = 0.002 per each 100 packs, P = 0.01).\n\nConclusions\n\nIntracranial stenosis is associated with longer exposure and poorer control of vascular risks. Early diagnosis and aggressive medical management of vascular risk may reduce intracranial stenosis and subsequent stroke risk. Evaluating a role for adjunctive therapies should be considered a research priority in this field.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nNA\n\nAS16-051\n\nHOW ARE COMORBIDITIES RELATED TO RECURRENT STROKE?

Turner3\n\n1University of Aberdeen, Institute of Medical Sciences, Aberdeen, United Kingdom\n\n2University of Glasgow, Division of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, Glasgow, United Kingdom\n\n3Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Aberdeen, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and Aims\n\n60% of patients with stroke are reported to have three or more comorbid conditions. For those who survive an initial event, recurrent stroke is an important complication. We explored the relationship of comorbidity with recurrent stroke, defined as a new event requiring hospital admission.\n\nMethods\n\nData was extracted from the Scottish Stroke Care Audit and linked to hospital admissions for the ten years prior to the initial stroke event.\n\nResults\n\n77779 patients were included in the analysis. 6.6% had a recurrent stroke within one year. Patients with myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and renal disease had an increased likelihood of recurrent stroke within 1 year as did those with an increasing Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score.\n\nTable 1.

ISCT require cohorts of virtual patients (VP) to perform simulations. An advantage of a VP cohort is that data sharing is not limited by privacy issues. An important requirement for an ISCT to obtain realistic simulation results is that VPs are similar to real patients. We present three statistical methods to develop a representative ischemic stroke VP cohort.\n\nMethods\n\nEleven prognostic clinical and imaging parameters were selected from patients in the MR CLEAN Registry database. To generate VPs we used a method similar to Multiple Imputation By Chained Equations (MICE), a Conditional Regression (CR) and a Normal Copula (NC) method. Performance of the methods was assessed graphically by comparing distributions and correlations of simulated and real patient data. Furthermore, discriminative ability of a model predicting whether a patient was from the original or simulated dataset was evaluated (area under ROC-curve).\n\nResults\n\nWe generated 1500 virtual stroke patients per method. The discrimination between the original and simulated set was poor, which implies adequate performance of all three methods, MICE = 0.55 (95%Confidence Interval (CI) 0.54-0.57), CR = 0.52 (95% CI 0.50-0.54), NC = 0.56 (95% CI 0.54-0.58). Correlations between variables in the simulated data were comparable to the ones in the original data.\n\nConclusions\n\nAll three statistical methods are appropriate to generate a representative cohort of virtual stroke patients.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nThis project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 777072\n\nAS16-089\n\nDERIVING AN INDICATOR OF STROKE SEVERITY FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA\n\nA.Y.X.

We aimed to derive an indicator of stroke severity using administrative data.\n\nMethods\n\nWe included all patients with stroke admitted to acute care hospitals between April 2002 and March 2013 in the Ontario Stroke Registry. The registry collected detailed clinical information, including stroke severity. We linked the registry to administrative databases and identified variables at or within the first 48 hours of admission that might be associated with severe stroke (Canadian Neurological Scale score < 4 or NIHSS >15). We used multivariable logistic regression models with variables from administrative data to predict severe strokes based on information in the registry and used bootstrap resampling to calculate C-statistics. We included all covariates significantly associated with the outcome in univariable analysis.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 39,972 patients (49% female, median age 75 [64,83] years). Variables in administrative data that were associated with severe stroke included female sex, higher age, high acuity triage level, arrival by ambulance, transfer to higher-level care, early admission to intensive care unit, early mechanical ventilation, motor weakness, speech disturbance, or decreased level of consciousness (p < 0.001). We are in the process of completing the multivariable analyses.\n\nConclusions\n\nAn indicator of stroke severity is crucial for risk-adjustment when evaluating stroke outcomes in population health studies.

Saposnik3\n\n1Western University, Clinical Neurological Sciences, London, Canada\n\n2ICES, Epidemiology, London, Canada\n\n3University of Toronto, Department of Medicine- Division of Neurology, Toronto, Canada\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nCardiac complications are common after ischaemic stroke. It remains unknown whether this is because of shared risk factors and pre-existing heart disease or, alternatively, due to stroke-induced heart injury. We assessed whether first-ever ischaemic stroke is associated with increased risk of incident heart disease in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities.\n\nMethods\n\nThis population-based cohort study included 93,627 residents in Ontario between 2002 and 2012, aged >65 years, without prior cardiovascular disease. We compared the incident risk of MACE (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, coronary artery revascularization, or cardiovascular death) at 1 year in patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke vs. propensity-matched individuals without stroke history or heart disease (4:1 matching, using 31 variables). We used Cox regression adjusted for variables with residual weighted standardized differences >10% or known to influence the risk of heart disease to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (HR).\n\nResults\n\nOverall, 21,931 patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke and 71,696 propensity-matched individuals were well-balanced on all variables used for propensity-matching (weighted differences ≤5%). First-ever ischaemic stroke was associated with increased risk of incident cardiovascular events (HR 4.5, 95% CI 4.3-4.8) after propensity-matching. The adjusted risk of MACE was highest in the first 30 days (HR 25.0, 95% CI 20.5-30.5) and declined thereafter: HR 4.8, 95% CI 4.1-5.7 between days 31 and 90, and HR 2.2, 95% CI 2.0-2.4 between days 91 and 365.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this large population-based study, ischaemic stroke was independently associated with increased risk of incident heart disease, suggesting that stroke-induced heart injury may explain post-stroke cardiovascular complications.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nScientific Communications 03-Heart & Brain\n\nAS03-008\n\nWHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF RECURRENT ISCHEMIC STROKE AFTER EMBOLIC STROKE OF UNDETERMINED SOURCE (ESUS)? – INSIGHTS FROM THE NAVIGATE-ESUS TRIAL\n\nR.

Despite the high annual stroke recurrence rate after ESUS, little is known about the etiology underlying recurrent strokes. We analysed recurrent ischemic strokes (IS) reported in NAVIGATE-ESUS.\n\nMethods\n\nNAVIGATE-ESUS was a randomised, controlled trial comparing efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 15 mg versus aspirin 100 mg in patients with ESUS. IS were validated by adjudicators blinded to group assignment and classified by local investigators into the categories ESUS or non-ESUS (comprising lacunar, cardioembolic, atherosclerotic, other categories or insufficient testing).\n\nResults\n\n309 IS were identified during the mean follow-up period of 11.0 months. The annual recurrence rate of IS was 4.6%/y in both groups. Sufficient diagnostic testing was unavailable in 39 patients. 156/270 (57.8%) of classifiable recurrent strokes were ESUS while 114/270 were non-ESUS recurrent strokes (table). Risk of recurrence by etiologies did not differ between treatments except for cardioembolism.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe majority of recurrent strokes after ESUS were deemed to be embolic but source remained undetermined in >80%.

Multivariate stepwise regression with forward selection of covariates assessed the association between SVE (classified in four groups according to their number per 10seconds of ECG: no SVE, >0-1SVEs, >1-2SVEs and >2SVEs) and outcomes during follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier product limit method estimated the 10-year cumulative probabilities of outcomes in each group. We calculated the negative prognostic value (NPV) of the presence of any SVE to predict AF.\n\nResults\n\nAmong 853 ESUS patients followed for 2857 patient-years, 226 (26.5%) patients had at least one SVE. AF was detected in 125 (14.7%) of patients: 8.9%, 22.5%, 28.1% and 48.3% in patients with no SVE, >0-1SVE, >1-2SVE and >2SVE respectively. In multivariate regression analysis, compared to patients with no SVEs, the corresponding hazard-ratios were 1.80 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI):1.06-3.05], 2.26 (95% CI:1.28-4.01) and 3.19 (95% CI:1.93-5.27). The NPV of the presence of any SVE for the prediction of new AF was 91.4%. There was no statistically significant association of SVE with the risk of ischemic stroke recurrence and death.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn ESUS patients with no SVEs during hospitalization, the probability that AF will not be detected during a follow-up of 3.4 years is > 91%.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS15-043\n\nYIELD AND PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF ROUTINE TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY IN TIA AND STROKE: A POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY\n\nS.

Rothwell1; on behalf of the Oxford Vascular Study\n\n1University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and Aims\n\nEchocardiography is recommended to identify a cardiac source of embolism causing TIA or stroke. However, the diagnostic yield of routine transthoracic echocardiography and any related prognostic value are uncertain.\n\nMethods\n\nConsecutive eligible consenting patients with TIA and stroke in a population-based study (the Oxford Vascular Study) underwent transthoracic echocardiography within 1 month of the event. High- and medium-risk echocardiographic findings were identified based on the TOAST classification.\n\nResults\n\nAmong 906 eligible patients a high-risk cardiac source of embolism was identified in 14 cases (1.5%), while at least one medium-risk source was identified in 202 (22.3%) cases, including moderate or severe left atrial dilatation in 99 (10.9%). High-risk cardiac source of embolism was more common if there was a history of atrial fibrillation (5.4%; p = 0.021), or myocardial infarction (6.8%; p = 0.022), but was found in only 0.6% of patients in the absence of symptomatic cardiac disease. During 4287 patient-years of follow-up 47 patients had a recurrent stroke. The presence of a high-risk cardiac source of embolism was associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke (HR = 8.71, 95% CI 3.00-25.28), but the presence of a medium-risk source was not (HR = 0.89, 0.44-1.81), although moderate or severe left atrial dilatation was associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke after adjustment for age, sex and known atrial fibrillation (HR 2.63, 1.24-5.56).\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the absence of symptomatic cardiac disease, routine transthoracic echocardiography has a low yield of findings which might alter management, but it does provide some useful prognostic information.\n\nTrial registration number\n\nN/A\n\nAS15-015\n\nPREVALENCE AND OVERLAP OF POTENTIAL EMBOLIC SOURCES IN PATIENTS WITH EMBOLIC STROKE OF UNDETERMINED SOURCE\n\nG.
