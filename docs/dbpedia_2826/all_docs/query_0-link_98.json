So I jumped in,\" he told daily VG.\n\n\"I was down there an hour, I was panicking,\" he said, adding there were \"animals\" crawling on his body.\n\nCato Bernsten Larson after he was retrieved from the toilet. Photo: Terje Bringedal/VG\n\nOvercome by nausea and vomiting, he tried in vain to pull himself of the tank, and which is only emptied once a year, according to VG.\n\nHe ultimately decided to contact the fire brigade to help end his ordeal in the small town of Drammen outside Oslo.\n\nDramen, south west of Oslo, in Norway. Photo: Google Maps\n\n\"It was a fairly easy task for us. We sent a four-man crew with a chainsaw and they cut open the front of the (plastic) toilet,\" fire brigade spokeswoman Tina Brock told AFP.\n\nThe rescue was a \"first\" for the local fire brigade, she acknowledged. \"It was pretty full down there.\"\n\nThe phone was not recovered."
