        "text": "MLRA notes\n\nMajor Land Resource Area (MLRA): 090B–Central Wisconsin Thin Loess Dissected Till Plain\n\nThe Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess MLRA, Northern and Southern Parts (90A and 90B) correspond closely to the North Central Forest and the Forest Transition Ecological Landscapes, respectively. Some of the following brief overview is borrowed from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ecological landscape publications (2015).\n\nThe Wisconsin and Minnesota Thin Loess MLRA, Northern and Southern Parts (90A and 90B) is an extensive glacial landscape that comprised of over 11.1 million acres (17,370 sq mi) throughout central and northern Wisconsin – about 27% of the total land area in the state. This glacial landscape is comprised of a heterogenous mix of loess-capped ground moraines, end moraines with eskers and ice-walled lake plains, and pitted, unpitted, and collapsed outwash plains sometimes interspersed with drumlins from the Illinoian and Pre-Illinoian glaciations. The entire area has been glaciated and nearly all of it is underlain by dense glacial till that impedes drainage. An extensive morainal system – the Perkinstown end moraine – spans most of the width of northern Wisconsin and divides the Northern and Southern Parts of this large landscape. This moraine, which has been sliced by outwash in many places, marks the southernmost extent of the Wisconsin glaciation (Wisconsin’s most recent glacial advance).\n\nNorth of the Perkinstown morainal system is a loess plain, with a loess mantle 6-24 inches thick. The northernmost edge of this landscape is an undulating till and outwash plain with materials deposited by the Chippewa Lobe. Drumlins are common in the northern and northeastern portions. The drumlins are oriented towards the southwest and formed during a glacial episode prior to the most recent glacial advance. Some are covered with glacial till. Pitted, unpitted, and collapsed outwash plains fill the spaces between drumlins. Detached from the major land mass to the northeast is the hummocky Hayward collapsed end moraines, where swamps, ice-walled lake plains, and eskers are common.\n\nMost of the MLRA to the south of the Perkinstown morainal system is an extensive ground moraine with some proglacial stream features including pitted outwash plains, terraces, and fans. A layer of loess 6-47 inches thick covers much of the area. Like the Northern Part, all areas of the Southern Part of this MLRA were glaciated, although the southcentral portion is a relatively older till plain with materials from the Illinoian and pre-Illinoian glaciations, not the most recent Wisconsin glaciation. The landforms in the southcentral portion are highly variable. Much of the area topography is controlled by underlying bedrock. Sandstone outcrops and pediments can be found here. Some of the most southern portions of the MLRA are mixed glacial deposits and residuum.\n\nThe land surface of the southeastern portion was formed by many small glacial advances and retreats. Morainal ridges protrude through an erosional, pitted outwash-mantled surface. These parallel ridges run in a northeast to southwest orientation and are dissected by many steams.\n\nThe continental climate of this MLRA is typical of northcentral Wisconsin, with cold winters and warm summers. The southern boundary of this MLRA straddles Wisconsin’s Tension Zone, a zone of transition between Wisconsin’s northern and southern ecological landscapes. Historically, the mesic forests were dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis).\n\nSoil features\n\nThese sites are represented by the Burkhardt, Cress, Cromwell, Drammen, Duelm Variant, Elderon, Emmert, Graycalm, Hubbard, Karlin, Lilah, Lindquist, Mahtomedi, Menahga, Moberg, Nymore, Omega, Pelissier, Pence, Plainfield, Rosholt, Sayner, Udorthents, and Vilas soil series. Burkhardt is classified as a Typic Hapludoll; Duelm variant is an Aquic Hapludoll; Karlin, Plissier, Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas are classified as Entic Haplorthods; Hubbard is an Entic Hapludoll; Cress is a Humic Dystrudept; Lindquist is Lamellic Haplorthod; Drammen is a Lamellic Hapludalf; Graycalm is a Lamellic Udipsamment; Lilah is a Psammentic Hapludalf; Cromwell, Elderon, and Moberg are Typic Dystrudepts; Omega and Pence are Typic Haplorthods; Mahtomedi, Menahga, Nymore, Plainfield, and Rosholt are Typic Udipsamments; Emmert is a Typic Udorthent.\n\nThese soils formed in various parent materials including sandy or loamy alluvium; sandy, loamy, and gravelly outwash; sandy, loamy, gravelly, and cobbly drift; loamy till; and eolian sand. Soils are very deep, and somewhat excessively or excessively drained. They do not meet hydric soil requirements.\n\nSurface texture is sandy loam, silt loam, loamy sand, sand, and slightly to highly decomposed plant material. Some surface horizons have a fine sand or gravelly modifier. Subsurface textures are sandy loam, silt loam, loamy sand, and sand. Some horizons have fine sand, gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly modifiers. Soil pH ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid with values of 4.6 to 6.9. Carbonates may be present up to 8 percent beginning at 17 inches.\n\nCommunity 2.1\n\nJack Pine and/or Red Pine Phase\n\nJack pine and red pine have historically been almost entirely dependent on fire for regeneration. Jack pine is a predominantly a northern species and in southern part of Wisconsin seldom approaches its growth potential. Everywhere it occurs it is a pronounce pioneer, highly light demanding and resistant to drought and frost. It has low requirements for soil organic matter and nutrients. It is a prolific producer of seed and it often colonizes burnt over areas. Forest fires speed natural regeneration by opening the cones. However, today, jack pine is regenerated mostly by planting. Without disturbance jack pine does not regenerate and is readily succeeded by various species, even those of only moderate shade tolerance, such as white pine and red oak. Historically, red pine has often occurred in mixtures with jack pine. In terms of light, soil moisture and nutrient requirements it is intermediate between jack and white pines. In contrast to jack pine, natural red pine regeneration is often found in moderately dense pure or mixed pine stands, although not to the same extent as is white pine. Under current ecological and economic conditions red pine is regenerated almost entirely by planting.\n\nDominant plant species\n\njack pine (Pinus banksiana), tree\n\nred pine (Pinus resinosa), tree\n\nCommunity 2.2\n\nRed Oak- Red Maple Phase\n\nAlthough a ubiquitous species, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is far more characteristic of northern rather than southern forest regions. Its most notable ecological characteristic is the ability to rapidly invade cut-over and burned-over areas. However, its perpetuation depends entirely on recurrence of disturbance. Because of its extreme intolerance to shade, it is readily replaced by many tree species in the absence of disturbance. Once in place, aspen reproduces entirely by sprouting from extensive, superficial root systems (root suckering). Most aspen stands on this Ecological Site resulted from sprouting following clear cutting of mixed stands of pine and/or oak, in which some aspen trees were still present. Paper birch (Betula papyrifera) is often a member of aspen stands. It shares aspen’s intolerance of shade and also produces small, winged seeds that readily disperse by wind. It does not sucker from root sprouts, but it readily sprouts from stumps upon clear cutting. It also has greater ability than does aspen of reproducing from seed under favorable seedbed conditions and in presence of large canopy openings. However in absence of disturbance it also succeeds to other species.\n\nDominant plant species\n\nnorthern red oak (Quercus rubra), tree\n\nred maple (Acer rubrum), tree\n\nOther references\n\nCleland, D.T.; Avers, P.E.; McNab, W.H.; Jensen, M.E.; Bailey, R.G., King, T.; Russell, W.E. 1997.
