        "text": "🗼🇫🇷🥇DID YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT THE PARIS OLYMPICS MEDALS? The Paris 2024 Olympic medals are deeply symbolic of French culture and history. Highlights include: * Presentation: Delivered on Louis Vuitton trays. * Design: Created by the 240-year-old Maison Chaumet, inspired by Empress Josephine Bonaparte. * Manufacture: Made by the French Mint, which also crafted the 1924 Paris medals. * Features: * The face of 'Marianne', symbolizing the French republic. * A hexagonal piece in the center, representing the shape of mainland France. * This hexagon includes an actual piece of the Eiffel Tower, preserved from early 20th-century renovations. * Ribbons: Made in Saint-Étienne, incorporating the Eiffel Tower's patterns. The Paralympic medal's ribbon is in the original red of the Eiffel Tower. * Paralympic Medal: The back features a tactile design of looking up the Eiffel Tower and \"Paris 2024\" in Braille-style, honoring Louis Braille. 🏅 The Thrill of Victory: Winning Gold! 🌟 Watching athletes win a Gold Medal for their country in the Olympics is an exhilarating experience!

This fascinating connection is explored in the newly published article, \"Liquid Streets: Early Modern Waterways in Urban Spaces\" in the edited volume The Street in the Urban Structure (Porto: CITCEM, 2024), based on Dr. Davide Martino's PhD research at the University of Cambridge. Dr. Martino's research draws intriguing parallels between urban highways and waterways, showing how waterways served as more than mere transport routes, but as venues for complex social and political activities. His work highlights examples like the 1589 celebrations in Tuscany, featuring a naval battle reenacted on the Arno river. Dr. Martino, now a postdoc in architectural history at Universität Bern, explains the contemporary relevance: “The Seine’s role in the Paris Olympics is thrilling. Beyond the opening ceremony, it will host open swimming, triathlon, and paratriathlon races. Despite criticisms over the clean-up costs, this effort symbolizes the healing of a century-old rift, as Paris reclaims the Seine as a vital urban space.” This research provides a profound perspective on the integration of waterways in urban development, emphasizing sustainable and shared use of our natural resources. 🌍 Read more here - https://lnkd.in/emCxJH78 #Paris2024 #OlympicGames! #UrbanHistory #Waterways #SustainableCities #ArchitecturalHistory\n\nI am really at a loss for words here. Switzerland, wtf. Switzerland is in general a very progressive culture when it comes to the environment and sustainability. But this. Authorities apparently granted permits (yet to be produced transparently) to ski event organizers who brought in heavy equipment to dig into fragile glacial areas to produce a ski run. Money, of course, is driving all this. Tens of millions in ad revenue is at stake. There are layers of comically and tragically wrong decisions. From the real-world negative impact of digging up glaciers - which are melting at an unprecedented pace - for a poorly timed event - to the sheer bad form on the world stage (photos of this are everywhere), the call for this action must have accountability and consequences. Collectively, we have to be better than this at planning and delivering. The sponsors and advertisers of the World Ski Championships, scheduled for mid-November, should condemn this action and demand appropriate environmental rehabilitation be implemented. Or pull their support entirely. #sustainability\n\nThis year’s Omega European Masters is just around the corner, and as their sustainability agency, we are thrilled to share some of our journey in this Le Nouvelliste interview. Thank you Gregory Cassaz! 🌿 Here are some key highlights: ♻️ In 2022, the tournament was rewarded as one of the first GEO Certified Tournaments in Europe (among the most prestigious certifications of the sport industry) but Neil Beecroft, The SHIFT Co-Founder stresses that “it does not mean it’s perfect”, “but it certainly validates commitment and continuous improvement.” 🌱 For Yves Mittaz, the Director of the tournament, it is essential for an organisation of this type to commit to the best possible practices. And he is trying to do his part. “We replaced the 50’000 bottles initially sold with 15 water fountains. All this comes at a price. But we must do it to make progress.” 🌏 The tournament commits to offsetting 100% of its Scope 1 & 2 emissions this year and plans to go even further. \"From next year, we will offer visitors the chance to financially compensate for their own carbon footprint, just the same way as the organisation offsets its own,\" explains Clemence Gillier from The SHIFT.

That day, what started with the thrill of competition turned into a test of resilience as injury shifted my course, turning a lead into a lesson learned at the finish line. This experience wasn't just about a race; it was about discovering the power of perseverance. When my event was removed from Tokyo 2020, my sights naturally shifted to Paris 2024. Each step, each stroke, and each pedal was fueled by a dream that went beyond the finish line. Yet, life often writes scripts we never expect. Today, I'm at a crossroads where my heart and priorities have guided me towards a decision that might come as a surprise: stepping away from my Paris 2024 aspirations. This choice, deeply personal and profoundly clear, is not about leaving a dream behind. It's about embracing what matters most - the well-being and happiness of my family. As I look back at the hurdles and triumphs, from the vibrant lanes of Rio to the winding roads leading to Paris, I carry with me not just the spirit of competition but lessons in adaptability, courage, and the strength that comes from facing life's unpredictabilities. What lies ahead is unwritten, and that's what makes it exciting. My journey continues, not on the track, but in uncharted territories, fueled by the same passion and determination that brought me to the world stage. Join me on this new adventure, one that promises just as much growth and excitement. Subscribe to my YouTube channel (https://lnkd.in/gvnchRtS) to witness the next chapter unfold. Your support has been my stronghold, and I can't wait to share this journey with you. Thank you for being part of my story.\n\n🚴♀️❄️ In one of my last posts I discussed the Event Calendar for Prague and the Czech Republic in general and how this can influence the planning and pricing for the hotel business from the revenue management point of view including the operational aspect of the marketing actions, and finally here we go with two major sporting events of the beginning of the year within the regions of the Czech Republic in February 2024: 🏆 2024 UCI Cyclocross World Championship - February 2-4 🎿 IBU World Championships Biathlon 2024 - February 7-18 These events significantly influenced the local business and promising not only sporting excitement, but also a considerable boost to local economies. Tabor is gearing up to host the prestigious Cyclocross World Championship, whereas Nove Mesto na Morave is set to witness the pinnacle of biathlon excellence. We could have seen a surge in demand, creating a prime opportunity to optimize pricing strategies. Smart revenue management during this period could maximize profits and enhance the overall guest experience. Respecting the booking window what where the major business insights so far? 📊 Strategic Collaboration 📊 Local Partnerships 📊 Advance Booking Strategies 📊 Dynamic Pricing Let's leverage the energy of these major events to not only elevate the hospitality experience, but also drive sustainable revenue growth for our businesses now and in the upcoming and highly interesting months. #RevenueOptimization #CzechEvents #SportsHospitality #CyclocrossChampionship #BiathlonWorlds #StrategicCollaboration #Bookolo\n\nWhat's the similarity between trial biking and the one-inch punch? Is there any similarity? I believe so. I have always enjoyed watching trial bike events on TV (check the clip, not to be mistaken with trail biking). It's fascinating to watch riders mix slow and fast on their motorcycles with exceptional balance and control, to go through courses that can simply be described as crazy. And then there's the unbelievably fascinating one-inch punch that Bruce Lee made famous. Where, a person with their fist at anywhere between 0 and 6 inches from an object, can break it. You might have seen clips of people breaking bricks with a punch that starts really close to the object. [check this one: https://lnkd.in/geviYNZv] How that is different from a regular punch is, a regular punch has the distance of the swing of the arm to build momentum and force. Picture something like Marvel's Juggernaut who just runs through walls without stopping. In contrast, the beauty of trial biking and the one-inch punch is how practitioners channel an almost exact amount of strength or power or speed and not much more. Which means they can jump to higher ground, or break bricks, but the bike or the arm does not swing much more than that. A perfect blend of excess and restraint. Of power and control. https://lnkd.in/geYXGDjg #balance"
