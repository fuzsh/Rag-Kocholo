The bridge has free spans of up to 60 meters and a sailing height of up to 12 metres.\n\nUntil now it is the longest bridge in Norway – 1,890 meters!\n\nRevolutionary MSS technology has proven its productivity.\n\nThe contractor for the bridge was Ingeniør Thor Furuholmen A/S, one of the largest companies in Norway at the time. They later merged with Ing. F. Selmer A/S to Selmer – Furuholmen AS, which today is Skanska Norge AS.\n\nIn collaboration with the consulting company Taugbøl & Øverland A/S (now COWI), the MSS was designed and put into production.\n\nConstruction work began in the autumn of 1973. The span by span casting of the bridge deck was carried out with a newly developed type of MSS, 131 meters long (800 tonnes weight), which enabled full casting at a speed of up to 100 meters of bridge per 14 days. Bridge deck has been casted 4 weeks before end of construction schedule.\n\nSince that time the MSS Drammensvogna has been redesigned for many bridge projects in Nordic countries as underslung and overhead MSS.\n\nOn the engineering side, competence on the equipment has been maintained internally at Skanska, and there has also been good cooperation with for the consulting with us – company Strukturas as.\n\nAll the projects accomplished with the Drammensvogna MSS:\n\n1.

Bridge supported by two pylons approximately 52 m high and 20 m wide at the base.\n\nThe superstructure is made up of a concrete slab that is supported on longitudinal and transverse by structural steel beams.\n\nBalanced cantilever construction method of the deck – Cast-In-Situ with Form Travellers.\n\nThe Underslung Form Traveller solution can be adapted to different types of bridge decks, such as arch bridges and cable-stayed bridges, leaving enough room to assemble the temporary or final cable stays, and allowing easy launchback to the initial assembly position.\n\nThe external formwork of this type of Form Traveller is supported by the main structure, leaving enough room to install the pre-assembled rebar cage. When the rebar cage is pre-assembled, the Strukturas Underslung Form Traveller is the perfect choice.\n\nHighlighs & Facts:\n\nSegment Length: 7,75m\n\nLength of Hammerhead: 19,9m\n\nMAX Segment Weight: 132,7ton\n\nMAX Width Superstructure: 12,8m\n\nMin.Hor.Radius: R=1195m\n\nMax Long Slope: 7,0%\n\nCrossfall: 0%\n\nDeflection of Main Beam: L/400\n\nCritical Wind Speed During Launching: 20,0 m/sec\n\nCritical Wind Speed During Concreting: 32,0 m/sec\n\nClient: CONCREARMADO LTDA.\n\nProject Location: Puerto Lleras, Meta, Colombia\n\nSTRUKTURAS\n\nWE MAKE IT SIMPLE !\n\nSee the video below and do not hesitate if you wish to consult about your bridge!\n\nTB Heubach Bridge demolition\n\nImplenia, a leading construction services company, decided to use an Strukturas Movable Scaffolding System (MSS) Underslung for the demolition of existing concrete decks on the TB Heubach Bridge in Germany.\n\nMoreover this same MSS is also used for the construction of the bridge’s new TT section decks.\n\nThe Heubach valley bridge consists of two parallel structures, which will be demolished and rebuilt in two construction phases.\n\nBridge info:\n\nYear of construction of existing building: 1968\n\nLength: 184 meters\n\nWidth: 16.5+16.5 meters\n\nBridge spans: 30,6 + 37,5 + 45 + 37,5 + 30,6 meters\n\nMax. height above ground: 18 meters\n\nDemolition of the old bridge and the construction of the new Heubach bridge was awarded by Die Autobahn GmbH des Bundes.\n\nMSS at assembling final stage\n\nDeck demolition\n\nThe Strukturas MSS solution is particularly innovative because it allows the conversion of the MSS formwork from a box section, which is used during the demolition phase, to a TT section, which is used during the construction of the new bridge decks. This approach saves time and resources, making the construction process more efficient.\n\nThe challenging conditions on the job site made the assembly of the MSS particularly demanding, and the Strukturas MSS assembly team had to plan and execute the operation to the best of their ability.\n\nMovable Scaffolding System ensures the minimal intervention to existing infrastructure.\n\nUsing MSS for demolition allows the existing highway and the road bellow to remain open throughout most of the demolishing period.\n\nThe engineering challenge – to avoid an overload of the superstructure during the demolition and to ensure a safe load transfer within the load capacity of the MSS.\n\nMSS general cross section view when used to demolish the existing concrete decks.\n\nHighlights & Facts:\n\nMax Span: 45,0m\n\nMax MSS Span: 45,0m\n\nWeight of the concrete bridge: Approx 250 KN/m\n\nWidth Of Bridge Slab: 16.5m\n\nMin. Hor. Radius: R= 2500m\n\nMax Crossfall: 2.1%\n\nMax Long Slope: 0,63%\n\nDeflection of MSS: MAX L/400\n\nThe demolition of old bridge structures with MSS is an effective and safe solution for many bridges.\n\nSee the video below and do not hesitate if you wish to consult about your bridge!\n\nSTRUKTURAS\n\nWE MAKE IT SIMPLE!\n\nStrukturas MSS approved as safe construction method to build bridge over the railway\n\nThe Bane NOR – Norwegian National Rail Administration has approved Strukturas MSS – Movable Scaffolding System as a safe construction method to build the bus road bridge over the railway line in Stavanger.\n\nThe joint venture of Risa AS and Contur AS, with COWI as adviser, won the competition to build the Bussveien through Jåttåvågen, between Vaulen and Gausel in Stavanger.\n\nThe implementation of Strukturas as overhead MSS allows the railway to remain open throughout most of the construction period.\n\nThere is thus no need for a separate safety culvert over the railway, and train traffic can run while the biggest part of the concrete works is in progress.\n\nWhen a contractor has to cast concrete or launch the overhead MSS over the railway they have to do it while there is no train traffic.\n\nBut they can do this work either at night when there is no train traffic or in periods where Bane NOR has approved stoppages in train traffic over several days.\n\nBut most of the time concrete workers can work inside of the Strukturas as overhead MSS with ongoing traffic below.\n\nIf we had built in the usual way with traditional formwork, we would have had to secure the railway with a safety culvert and take additional safety measures to safeguard train traffic and other traffic under the bridge while the work is in progress, says Per Ove Stokkeland, project manager in Rogaland fylkeskommune .\n\nSpecial services for one of our first customers!\n\nOur client, Mota-Engil, currently the largest Portuguese construction company present in various markets worldwide, has awarded Strukturas the redesign project of an Overhead MSS originally not provided by us and which had been stored for several years in their yard in Poland.\n\nStrukturas’ redesign introduced significant modifications to the MSS, including a hinge joint between the main girder and the front nose, allowing it to be used on plan view curved decks, the addition of a rear concreting support, which allows for the transportation of pre-assembled U-shaped reinforcement using electrical winches, and the supply of a hydraulically operated internal formwork.\n\nMota-Engil transported the MSS from Poland to Portugal, where it is currently being used in the construction of railway viaducts. The rebuilt MSS steel structure was done in Portugal. Mota-Engil gave a special attention to pre-assembly and testing both at the workshop and at their central yard, due to the MSS being stored in Poland for several years.\n\nStrukturas has been supplying various bridge building equipment, including Formtravellers FT and Movable Scaffolding Systems MSS, to Mota-Engil for around 30 years. Our the first supply was made in 1994 of an Underslung MSS to the company, that was then called Engil and later included in the Mota group, giving rise to the current Mota-Engil.\n\nStrukturas Overhead MSS for Bridge SO 203"
