The facility located in Drammen, Norway serves as PrimaGaz’s only Norwegian based facility. This supply hub carries out both a critical reserve and distribution operations. The LPG is acquired from the nearby ESSO Norge AS refinery (a division of ExxonMobil). Once it arrives at PrimaGaz’s facility, the reserve LPG is distributed via mobile tankers to supply fuel stations.

Mr. Aasen explained how PrimaGaz previously utilized kammprofile gaskets at this critical hub, however, the kammeprofile gaskets began to degrade, developing leaks. These leaks were not tolerated and the switch to the DeltaV-Seal gasket was completed. After having been in operation for 3 years, PrimaGaz is happy to report that there have been absolutely no leaks since switching to the DeltaV-Seal gasket. He further stated that based on the life-span of the plant and of the DeltaV-Seal, PrimaGaz has no plans to change the gaskets again for the duration of operations at the Drammen location.
