The problem is, Sebastian's not funny. But after his father's death, with no choice but to beg in the streets, the half-human, half-elf teen sets off with Max, his father's slightly cynical Buffalope, to offer his services as a jester to King Septimus of Keladon. On the way, they meet Captain Cornelius Drummel, small in stature, but the fiercest of fighters. The three rescue the fair princess Kerin, who's being held captive by brigands, and happily escort her home. If only Sebastian knew the kidnapping was engineered by the evil King Septimus! undefined Sebastian Darke, Science fiction, Fiction, Children's & Educational, Books, Fantasy & magical realism, General, Adventure stories, Adventure Stories, Children's Fiction & Fun, Science Fiction, Fantasy & Magical Realism",
