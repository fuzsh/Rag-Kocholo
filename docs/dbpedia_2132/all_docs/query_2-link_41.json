It looks like you are trying to create an instance of SmtpClient to send a message.

You want MailMessage. You also want to pass the server credentials to SmtpClient.\n\nThis question here explains how to do it with Gmail.\n\nSending email through Gmail SMTP server with C#\n\nThis should be a simple fix for you.
