        "text": "The calendar might say spring for a few more weeks, but it's already summer in Central Texas, and you've probably even seen school-break reading lists start trickling home. We've got a few suggestions of our own to augment your teachers' lists consider them extra credit (or a lifesaver, depending on how voracious a reader you have at home):\n\nBest way to learn a painless history lesson: Austin author Janice Shefelman brings 18th-century Venice to life in her delightful ‘Anna Maria's Gift' (Random House; $12.99). This novella, inspired by Shefelman's love of the legendary Antonio Vivaldi, follows orphan Anna Maria Lombardini as she learns to play violin from the maestro, who once upon a time really did teach music in an orphanage. Anna Maria practices with a golden violin built by her father, but when her talent overshadows the previous star of the class, the jealous rival tosses Anna Maria's keepsake into the canal. The hunt that ensues brings Anna Maria closer to her teacher, as well as some of her friends.\n\nShefelman's skill in weaving together the facts with the story shines here (a former teacher and librarian, she's written dozens of books, including Texas Bluebonnet nominee \"A Paradise Called Texas\"). Your young reader won't even realize she's getting a crash course in Italian culture when she reads about the Pieta orphanage or the Grand Canal. Dreamy pen-and-ink sketches by illustrator Robert Papp accent the text. (Ages 6-9)\n\nHow to keep your fantasy aficionado busy for a weekend:There are tons of magical adventurers out there in tween-reader land, but few are as wryly funny as Sebastian Darke, the half-elf, half-human hero of Philip Caveney's series. In ‘Sebastian Darke: Prince of Explorers'(Knopf; $17.99), Sebastian joins again with the warrior dwarf Cornelius and the tart-tongued buffalope Max after a wealthy merchant hires them to discover the lost city of Mendip. Exotic locales? Check. Derring-do? Check. Witty rejoinders? Check. All the ingredients are here on the third outing for this sometimes-bumbling (but always endearing) hero. (Ages 12 and older)\n\nGuilty pleasure you'll cadge from your teen-ager:\"Sex and the City\" creator Candace Bushnell has trained her eye on Carrie Bradshaw's early years, bringing high-schoolers a look at what the Cosmo-swizzling social chronicler was like when she was their age. ‘The Carrie Diaries'(HarperCollins; $18.99) finds our heroine at story's start depressed over being rejected from a prestigious summer writing seminar and the reappearance of Sebastian Kydd, whose drop-dead gorgeous visage last graced Carrie's when she was spouting something very, very embarrassing (and unprintable to boot). Cliques, mean girls and opposite-sex obsession — they've all been done before, but Bushnell's a master of the form, and fans of the show and Bushnell's other writing won't be disappointed.\n\nFair warning: The book's aimed at high school readers, but parents should know that while Carrie isn't already espousing the \"Sex and the City\" lifestyle to the fullest, many of her teen cohorts are. (Ages 14 and older)\n\nSnazziest-looking sequel: We first recommended Austin-born Greg Foley when his visually stunning \"Willoughby & the Lion\" picture book was published last year. Now Foley, who designs and creative-directs the art and fashion magazine Visionaire, among other titles, brings his wee adventurer back in ‘Willoughby & the Moon' (HarperCollins; $18.99). Willoughby must face his fears when he aims to discover why the moon outside his window has nearly disappeared. He'll ride a moon buggy and explore a cave before the story's through, but as with its predecessor, the biggest appeal of \"Moon\" is its richly layered art, full of sketches mixed with pixilated photographs and silvery accents that befit its lunar theme. Read it with your preschooler and then set aside some art time to see how Foley's work can inspire your own budding creative director. (Ages 4-7)\n\nSneaky way to get your sports nut to read:Summer always brings with it a crop of baseball books aimed at boys, but Andrea Montalbano bucks the trend with ‘Breakaway'(Penguin/Philomel; $16.99), which features soccer at its heart and girls' friendships at its soul. Lily James, better known as LJ, thinks the soccer field is the one place she can count on shining. But when her quest for personal glory costs her team an important game, she's benched for the championship. Gone are the high-fives in the hall and the adoration from her classmates. The only friend who sticks by her is Tabitha, whom LJ thinks is focused only on her iPhone and her looks. That the two will meet in the middle is a foregone conclusion, but Montalbano has a few surprises up her sleeve in this debut, ones that attracted prepublication praise from the likes of best-selling novelist Carl Hiaasen and Mike Lupica, the sportswriter whose latest baseball book is \"The Batboy.\" (Ages 12 and up)\n\nYour go-to summer title for toddlers:Nikki McClure nails the change of seasons perfectly in ‘Mama, Is It Summer Yet?' (Abrams; $17.95). McClure, whose illustrations graced the New York Times best-selling \"All in a Day,\" has created a gently unfolding field guide to the shifts in the natural world that signal summer. Her paper-cuts, mostly black and white with occasional hits of color, are simple yet evocative, all in response to a young boy's query:\n\n\"Mama, is it summer yet?\n\n\"Not yet, my little one. But the trees are blossoming. Soon tiny apples will appear.\"\n\nIt's the perfect book for a nature walk, nap time or trip to the park. And the book's early pages, with their depiction of the blustery, mercurial weather of spring, will seem like a welcome respite when triple digits have become enervatingly routine. (Ages 4-7)\n\nSharyn Vane's column on children's books appears monthly in the American-Statesman; swizda@austin.rr.com"
