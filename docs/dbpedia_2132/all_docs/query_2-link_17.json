        "text": "Philip Caveney was born in 1951 in Prestatyn, North Wales. His father was in the R.A.F, so during his childhood his family moved to a new military base every couple of years.\n\nHe has had several adult thrillers published in the past, but has now turned his hand successfully to children's books. His Sebastian Darke series has sold in 10 languages and was shortlisted for the Waterstones Prize. He lives in Manchester with his wife and 14 year old daughter."
