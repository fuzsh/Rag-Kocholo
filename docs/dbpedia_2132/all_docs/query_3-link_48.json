        "text": "\"I can't cope with this,\" Tanya's mother declares at the start of this exceptional debut novel (winner of this year's Waterstone's Children's Book Award), and promptly dispatches her daughter off to stay with the grandmother, in a suitably expansive and derelict mansion.\n\nIt is Tanya's fixation with fairies that has driven her mother to the end of her tether.\n\nAnd thus is set up a quintessentially English children's book adventure; child staying with grandmother in slightly spooky house has escapades involving little people.\n\nNow, whilst I am happy to read the classics in this genre, I have to say that a contemporary title of this ilk normally finds me a somewhat resistant reader. But I quickly found myself a thoroughly willing participant in the tale concocted by Harrison - one of fairy glamour and entrapment going back two generations.\n\nThe house itself and its principal occupants - Tanya's grandmother, the groundsman Warwick and his son Fabian (nicely chosen names, these) - evoke just the correct atmosphere. And when the fairy intrusion occurs it happens with such unexpected malevolence as to be completely unnerving and, in the book's best sequences, as exciting as an episode of 24.\n\nThere are occasional lapses of pace (usually when Harrison is attempting to convey narrative information via dialogue) and, quite importantly really, the book's title is never given proper significance or weighting. Having said that, the sheer power of invention and fluency of story narration carry the reader along in a fashion that makes its winning of the Waterstone's Award entirely understandable.\n\nHere we have a writer who you just know will go from strength to strength. There are superbly well-realised sequences - in the catacombs of the house, in the surrounding woods - which, in my own reader's mind I imagined as a TV dramatised adaptation, so visually vivid was the description.\n\nThe book has a Prologue and an Epilogue. Its chapters are of just the right length for children to read one (or more) in bed at night. Harrison herself decorates the initial letter of each new chapter, in a style suggesting she might also have contributed excellent narrative illustrations had the publisher been so inclined.\n\nCritical comment surrounding ï¿½Harry Potterï¿½ has increasingly failed to distinguish between popularity and content. The brand has become testament to the technologies and communications that have rendered popular culture as globalised. Commentary has focused around a rigid mythology surrounding its creator and creation rather than pinioning itself to the books themselves.\n\nIn establishing the ground-plan and layout for the final book, previous titles have worked towards determining this as a cataclysmic wrangling between good ï¿½ personified via Harry Potter ï¿½ and evil ï¿½ manifested through Voldemort in an epic battle that sends quakes of fear and impending danger through the whole of the wizard and non-wizard worlds alike.\n\nWith the exception of the opening of the novel, the impending doom, however, never feels to be significant, or indeed to exert itself on anyone other than a minor clique. Sentimentalism and sensation have removed the edge from this particular brand of danger.\n\nGenetic inheritance and race underpin the whole of Voldemortï¿½s philosophies and are structured as the backbone that affords Voldemortï¿½s evil a level of intent and thereby of plausibility. Failure to engage with this and a reticence to draw deeply from oblique thematic reference to Hitlerï¿½s ï¿½Final Solutionï¿½ make the concluding episode of the ï¿½Harry Potterï¿½ books flaccid shackling Voldemort to the position of a pantomime villain. As readers, we may ï¿½booï¿½, we may ï¿½hissï¿½, but there will be few that are chilled to the bones by result of the 'what if' as without root or foundation many of the blurrings between good and evil that Rowling has outlined are degraded\n\nMagic is as much a convenience as it is an integral part of a plausible culture and community. Delineations between the magic and non-magic world are shifting with squibs, mudbloods (or the more euphemistic term ï¿½Muggle-bornsï¿½ ï¿½ although this itself appears a derisory reference towards those lacking potential and ability, more so than non-wizards at least). Distinctions are rarely explained and so cohesion to the fundamental premise of this fantasy world is eroded.\n\nCharacterisation and development through the series is highly limited, restricted to a series of gropes and fumbles ï¿½ abhorrent stereotyping of adolescence - that allegedly symbolise the ascent towards physical and mental maturation.\n\nIf the paucity of ï¿½Pottermaniaï¿½ is indeed, truly a gauge of our reading culture, nationally, perhaps we should all be concerned that one series should, alone, have attained such breadth of focus in a country that annually publishes upwards of 10,500 books and that the 'magic' of the literary inheritance for the inhabitants of this sceptred isle is a world - like that of Hogwarts - unattainable for so many...\n\nHmm. Had this one for over three weeks and Iï¿½ve just finished. (Sorry Michael) My wife suggested that this initial sentence would suffice, but on we go.\n\nChapter One. Forces of light and of darkness. Mention of a ï¿½Nineï¿½ of heroes and heroines. A dark lord, a Black Tower (no, not the Liebfraumilch), a demon battle host. Any of that sound at all familiar?\n\nDonï¿½t get me wrong, Iï¿½m not at all anti-fantasy. I read and re-read The Lord of the Rings many times as a child. I consider Garth Nix to be ï¿½the businessï¿½: Ursula LeGuin even better. There is some tremendous stuff out there in this genre, but (to misquote Groucho Marx) Setting of a Cruel Sun just isnï¿½t it.\n\nFunnily enough, despite some of those early clichï¿½s, lack of imagination isnï¿½t the root of the problem in this book. There are a complex host of different peoples and even species imagined against a backdrop scented with our own Middle East. Roughly speaking they are grouped into the Hotec-Ra, the tyrants who have ruled the land with an iron hand (not a wooden foot or a piece of stringï¿½. Cf The Goon Show circa ï¿½59?), the Helati rebel slaves, who wish for a new era of equality and justice, and the fearsome Darkwing, a once-human, now life-hating demon lord. So, all the heroes have to do is defeat the overlords in a great battle and thwart the Darkwingï¿½s scheme to destroy the life-giving sun and everyone can settle down to a bit of serious sunbathing with maybe a cocktail or three. Piece of cake, and (although the usual good-versus evil-for-the-fate-of-mankind fare) an okay fantasy plot.\n\nThe problem comes first that this is a sequel that really feels like one for at least fifty pages, if not more. The story opens at the end of another great battle, with the Nine just recovering from a previous victory, and feels like a strange mixture of a formal history being unfurled and glimpses of a large number of individuals with too many pasts and characteristics to possibly cram into the text. Result: a real hard slog for several chapters.\n\nBut even when I had worked out who everyone was and what their aims were, I still struggled. I think this is partly due to that uncomfortable mix mentioned above (great history versus personal events) a mix that Tolkien manages well in a much longer work that grew over decades of imagining and re-imagining but just feels rushed, messy and formulaic here. Add to this a correspondingly strange narrative style that sometimes has characters directly analysing their own motives and actions against the wider backdrop in a most unconvincing way - ï¿½What do I feel?ï¿½ asks one particular traitorous villain, ï¿½Yes, I am jealousï¿½ There is comradeship among the enemy, whereas we Children of Ra cheat and deceive... I am without friends or confidants. In my loneliness, I envy my foe.ï¿½ ï¿½ and quite often brutally spells things out rather than letting us draw our own conclusions or allowing tension to mount: ï¿½The decision would have grave consequences. Before nightfall the next day, it would bring the swords of the Sol-ket down on his village.ï¿½\n\nI kept asking myself during my reading if I was being too harsh, but the reality is that I failed to engage emotionally with any of the characters, I was rarely surprised by the plot and, by the end, I felt as if I was simply filling in the numbers in a hellishly large but low-level Sudoku puzzle.\n\nAs ever, just one personï¿½s opinion. You might love it.\n\nThe ancient Greeks used to believe that the world was composed of four elements, earth, water, fire and air.\n\nFor Sapphy the battle is two-way rather than four, will the earth part of her nature ever manage to control the water elements that long to take her to sea? In Helen Dunmoreï¿½s second novel set in the world of Ingo, Sapphy continues the battle that her father lost in the first volume of the series.\n\nWith her father gone, her mother has found a new partner and moved the family from the cottage by the cove to the nearby but less hospitable St Pirans.\n\nWhile her brother Conor is willing to give the new lifestyle a go, Sapphy is less willing. Her reluctance is not helped by the fact that her ï¿½friendsï¿½ in Ingo continue to call her to the Cornish sea.\n\nHowever, they are not entirely benevolent spirits, danger lurks every time she goes to sea, from sharks and the risk that she become too comfortable in the water. The watery voices are at best ambivalent about the fate of the humans who inhabit the shoreline.\n\nAmong the watery beasts are those who would wish the sea to destroy the settlements of man and destruction of the Tide Knot ï¿½ the complex formation that ensures the tides fall as well as rise ï¿½ leads to disaster.\n\nSt Pirans is flooded and the pair are called upon to go to sea to help resolve the situation as Ingo dwellers realise that the demise of the tides is not all good news.\n\nThe Tide Knot is an engaging standalone read but it would benefit a little from having read the first volume as the back story to some of the relationships ï¿½ notably that between Conor and Elvira ï¿½ would be useful.\n\nThatï¿½s a minor point, however, as the character of the land and its relationship with the sea are at the heart of a lyrical and enchanting book.\n\nA young balletomane, Clair-de-Lune, lives alone with her austere grandmother, Madame Nuit. Her mother (La Lune) died whilst dancing a dying swan ballet, and she has been mute ever since. Such overtly symbolic names emulate the methods of fairy tale, which sets the mood for this story.\n\nThe setting has an historical atmosphere (think Paris, 150 years ago). Clair-de-Lune lives in a very tall, very old building populated by artistes. It also hides a talking mouse, Bonaventure, who dreams of starting his own ballet school, and a magical secret doorway to a monastery by the sea. Here Clair-de-Lune meets Brother Inchmahome, who through sensitive listening and a series of probing questions, helps her to unlock her heart and her voice.\n\nThe \"Ah, Reader!\" style of narration and slight frou-frou factor (silk gloves, a King Charles spaniel called Chouchou, ï¿½the exquisiteness of a troupe of mice, dancing.ï¿½) will estrange a significant proportion of readers. Describing Clair-de-Luneï¿½s lace collared dress, Golds notes: ï¿½It wasï¿½ not perhaps to everyoneï¿½s tasteï¿½. The same could be said of the book. Those who love ballet will adore hearing about the agonies and ecstasies of ï¿½The Danceï¿½. But the emphasis on lady-like behaviour and genteel manners will not appeal to girls who like climbing trees or, I suspect, boys.\n\nBonaventureï¿½s lengthy monologues (all his conversations with Clair-de-Lune are one-sided, after all) create a somewhat verbose read in places. And I couldnï¿½t help thinking that the romantic tale of a talking mouse had been done before (in Kate DiCamillo's The Tale of Despereaux). Golds asserts that ï¿½no one, to Bonaventureï¿½s knowledge, had ever beforeï¿½taught classical ballet to mice.ï¿½ Which of course put me in mind of Angelina Ballerina. The fascinating minutiae of mouse life (such as toothpick barres and toffee wrapper writing paper) have also been celebrated elsewhere, in Jill Barklemï¿½s Brambly Hedge books. However, these familiar elements are fetchingly sewn together.\n\nGoldsï¿½ narrative thread is straightforward ï¿½ the singular problem is Clair-de-Luneï¿½s frustrated desire to talk. But as the story progresses an emotional depth unfolds. Characters who I had feared to be one dimensional reveal themselves to be credibly complex. Through them the powerful effects of loss and of love are perceptively explored. An allegorical message, that love is the most important thing in life, lifts the story to a philosophical plane. Some will read this as a moving exposition of sadness and solitude, laced with poetic metaphor, which is reminiscent of The Little Prince in its profundity. Some will find it all a bit too frilly."
