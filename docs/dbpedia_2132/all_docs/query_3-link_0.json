        "text": "June 17, 2022\n\nAnd now, my journey through the Sebastian Darke series has come to a close. I have finished this series in less than a week, & was fully in love with it for the duration of my reading. This book, a prequel/spin-off to the main series, took my by surprise, I hadn't expected it to be written in first person. But the author had brilliantly encapsulated Max's voice, & through the entire tale I felt like I was being recounted it by Max himself, like a bedtime story. It was an amazing, & rather intriguing, experience to witness Max's early life, as well as his work for Alexander, Sebastian's father. Alexander felt like his own, strong character, but there were parts of him that felt like Sebastian, which is far from a bad thing. Alexander & Sebastian certainly felt like father & son.\n\nOf course, for a rather shorter book than the rest of the series, that spans many years instead of a few weeks, there were many plot points that were tackled. Despite the time span in which the book took place in, & the memoir-like nature of it, the story still included some very satisfying character developments & plot beats. There were no three parts to it, just one continuous story, but for the sort of book tis is, that fit perfectly.\n\nMy main gripe is that I wish it was longer. I know that Max said at the end of the book that someone else could retell his adventures with Sebastian, but I felt like Sebastian's birth was a very unsatisfying ending. I wanted to see baby Sebastian, how his father taught him to tell jokes & swordfight, & the string of unfortunate circumstances that led to Alexander's death. If the story had ended at Alexander's death, it would have been a far sadder ending (but an ending to which the series is no stranger to) but it would have come full circle & ended where the first book of the series began. But, ultimately, this was not my book, & not my story to tell, & Caveney clearly had a specific vision/intent for this book. Despite its flaws, it is still a good book, & an amazing part of the Sebastian Darke series.\n\nI only wish there was more of this, something else to sink my teeth into. At five books, the series is far from short, but it was an adventure I will hardly be able to forget, & will inevitable find myself coming back to in the coming years. Now, let me get on tumblr & see if there's any fanart.\n\nNovember 7, 2012\n\nReviewed by Kira M for TeensReadToo.com\n\nAs a young buffalope, Max lived with his father, mother, and pack. When a plague hit their pack, however, his family set out on their own. Unfortunately, they didn't get far before the cruel Navarians killed his father and captured Max and his mother.\n\nAfter being sold to a cruel master, he managed to escape, but soon met Alexander Darke, a kind human who wants to be a jester. As Max begins to be fluent in human, he realizes that Alexander could really use his help at improving his act.\n\nWill Max figure out a way to find his own happiness while helping Alexander?\n\nA cute, quick companion to the Sebastian Darke series of books. The characters are well-painted, and the unique perspective is well-crafted. Those who have liked the Sebastian Darke series, adventure, and fantasy stories will enjoy A BUFFALOPE'S TALE. This book, though, will make more sense for those who have read the other Sebastian Darke books."
