        "text": "When it comes to such simple things as communication, networking, and even relationships, there are three basic skills you need to remember. You need to build upon the relationship. You also need to maintain them, and work towards them growing. Joining us in the studio is music industry veteran Lyn Stevens who is an award winning photographer, who combines her love of photography with her passion for music. From that, she has learned the ability to network among industry peers, and shares her insight with our listeners. While on the subject, we also discuss documenting your career with photography, and how important it is in the bigger picture.\n\nSince her days as a producer at WIBA-FM and Morning DJ & Country Music Director WDUX in Wisconsin, Lyn has always had the bug to work in the music industry. Working in radio provided Lyn the opportunity to meet and interview legendary performers such as Merle Haggard, Ray Price, Charlie Daniels, Loretta Lynn, and The Kentucky Headhunters among many others.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville in 2009, her photography \"hobby\" started catching the eye of local performers. In 2012, the door was opened as Lyn was honored to have 3 of her photos on display as part of the Cameras and Community in Action Project at The Frist Center for The Visual Arts. Her work went on to be featured in Country Weekly, Billboard Magazine and the Nashville Music Guide.\n\nIn late 2014, she was asked by country legends, Little Texas, to shoot the photos for their album, \"Young for A Long Time,\" which garnered her the award for \"Best Visual Art\" at the 2015 Nashville Independent Music Awards.\n\nShe added the title, âInternational Photographerâ to her resume, after documenting a Blues/Rock tour to Australia in 2016 and another tour to Iceland in 2018. Her work has since been seen on television in Australia and in newspapers and magazines throughout Europe.\n\nShe approaches photography as a documentarian, based off the strong belief that she is documenting future history, in the present-day moment.\n\nCreator and Executive Producer Emeritus: Tom Sabella\n\nShowrunner and Host (the guy who has a face for podcasting): Bob Bender\n\nManagement Representation: Chuck Thompson for Thompson Entertainment Group, LLC\n\nCo-Producer - Audio/Video Editor (the man behind the curtain): Mark Sabella\n\nDirector of Video and Continuity (the brains of the entire operation): Deborah Halle\n\nMarketing and Social Media (all knowing): Sarah Fleshner for 362 Entertainment\n\nAll Around Problem Solver (and Mental Health Therapist for us): Connie Ribas\n\nRecorded inside what could be an old beat up Airstream Trailer located somewhere on whatâs left of Music Row in Nashville TN (Man we sure do miss Noshville, and the Longhorn Steakhouse)\n\nMixed and Mastered at Music Dog Studios in Nashville, TN\n\nEditing and Post at Midnight Express Studio located in Olian, NY\n\nProduction Sound Design: Keith Stark\n\nVoice Over and Promo: Lisa Fuson\n\nSpecial Thanks to the creator and founder of the podcast, Tom Sabella, along with Traci Snow for producing and hosting over 100 episodes of the original \"Business Side of Music\" podcast and trusting us to carry on their legacy.\n\nWebsite:\n\nIf you would like to be a guest on the show, please submit a request to:\n\nbob@businesssideofmusic.com\n\nIf youâre interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, let us know and weâll send you a media / sponsorship kit to you.

This strikingly personal account of Rosen's twenty six-plus year odyssey with Eddie, one of the greatest and most enigmatic musicians of the 20th Century. What was it like to call Ed a friend? Rosen shares with our listeners how he came about writing his book \"Tonechaser - Understanding Edward: My 26 Year Journey with Edward Van Halen\".\n\nSteve, is a professional music journalist with a career spanning 50 years. During this period, he has published well over 1,000 articles in major periodicals originating from around the Globe. Rosen was the West Coast correspondent for Guitar World Magazine for four years during the seminal mid-80's when he wrote eight cover stories - including three lead features on Eddie Van Halen, recognized as pivotal pieces on the legendary guitarist. Rosen has also written books on several high-profile musicians, including Jeff Beck, Prince, Black Sabbath, Free / Bad Company, and Randy Rhoads.\n\nwww.tonechaserbook.com\n\nCreator and Executive Producer Emeritus: Tom Sabella Showrunner and Host (the guy who has a face for podcasting): Bob Bender Management Representation: Chuck Thompson for Thompson Entertainment Group, LLC Co-Producer - Audio/Video Editor (the man behind the curtain): Mark Sabella Director of Video and Continuity (the brains of the entire operation): Deborah Halle Marketing and Social Media (all knowing): Sarah Fleshner for 362 Entertainment All Around Problem Solver (and Mental Health Therapist for us): Connie Ribas Recorded inside what could be an old beat up Airstream Trailer located somewhere on whatâs left of Music Row in Nashville TN (Man we sure do miss Noshville, and the Longhorn Steakhouse) Mixed and Mastered at Music Dog Studios in Nashville, TN Editing and Post at Midnight Express Studio located in Olian, NY Production Sound Design: Keith Stark Voice Over and Promo: Lisa Fuson\n\nSpecial Thanks to the creator and founder of the podcast, Tom Sabella, along with Traci Snow for producing and hosting over 100 episodes of the original \"Business Side of Music\" podcast and trusting us to carry on their legacy.\n\nIf you would like to be a guest on the show, please submit a request to: bob@businesssideofmusic.com\n\nIf youâre interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, let us know and weâll send you a media / sponsorship kit to you.

The awards dinner is a program of The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project, a 501c3 that supports military veterans, first responders and their families. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the program, co-founded by Country Music legend, Charlie Daniels with his longtime manager, David Corlew. Although Daniels passed in 2020, his musical legacy lives on, and his devotion to veterans causes continues through the dedication of Corlew. Through fundraising events, the organization supports the efforts of other not-for-profit organizations providing services to U.S. veterans and first responders; selected for providing the most meaningful work with the lowest overhead. TCHJHP has raised more than $4 million for these organizations.\n\nCorlew shares his story of how he got into the business, first working at a record store, then becoming a roadie for Charlie Daniels, before becoming his manager for the next 30+ years of Charlieâs career.\n\nwww.thecharliedanielsjourneyhomeproject.org\n\nCreator and Executive Producer Emeritus: Tom Sabella\n\nShowrunner and Host (the guy who has a face for podcasting): Bob Bender\n\nManagement Representation: Chuck Thompson for Thompson Entertainment Group, LLC\n\nCo-Producer - Audio/Video Editor (the man behind the curtain): Mark Sabella\n\nDirector of Video and Continuity (the brains of the entire operation): Deborah Halle\n\nMarketing and Social Media (all knowing): Sarah Fleshner for 362 Entertainment\n\nAll Around Problem Solver (and Mental Health Therapist for us): Connie Ribas\n\nRecorded inside what could be an old beat up Airstream Trailer located somewhere on whatâs left of Music Row in Nashville TN (Man we sure do miss Noshville, and the Longhorn Steakhouse)\n\nMixed and Mastered at Music Dog Studios in Nashville, TN\n\nEditing and Post at Midnight Express Studio located in Olian, NY\n\nProduction Sound Design: Keith Stark\n\nVoice Over and Promo: Lisa Fuson\n\nSpecial Thanks to the creator and founder of the podcast, Tom Sabella, along with Traci Snow for producing and hosting over 100 episodes of the original \"Business Side of Music\" podcast and trusting us to carry on their legacy.\n\nWebsite:\n\nIf you would like to be a guest on the show, please submit a request to:\n\nbob@businesssideofmusic.com\n\nIf youâre interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, let us know and weâll send you a media / sponsorship kit to you.

Are they (the artist) still viable? Is the cost (and the unpredictable weather when its outdoors) worth going to stand around with hopefully thousands of your closest friends in a partially filled event? Jack and Bob delve into why some acts should no longer find themselves anticipating performing at large venues, when its difficult to put butts in the seats, and the scaling back to smaller venues such as auditoriums or theaters (or clubs) might make more financial sense.... in spite of their egos.\n\nCreator and Executive Producer Emeritus: Tom Sabella\n\nShowrunner and Host (the guy who has a face for podcasting): Bob Bender\n\nManagement Representation: Chuck Thompson for Thompson Entertainment Group, LLC\n\nCo-Producer - Audio/Video Editor (the man behind the curtain): Mark Sabella\n\nDirector of Video and Continuity (the brains of the entire operation): Deborah Halle\n\nMarketing and Social Media (all knowing): Sarah Fleshner for 362 Entertainment\n\nAll Around Problem Solver (and Mental Health Therapist for us): Connie Ribas\n\nRecorded inside what could be an old beat up Airstream Trailer located somewhere on whatâs left of Music Row in Nashville TN (Man we sure do miss Noshville, and the Longhorn Steakhouse)\n\nMixed and Mastered at Music Dog Studios in Nashville, TN\n\nEditing and Post at Midnight Express Studio located in Olian, NY\n\nProduction Sound Design: Keith Stark\n\nVoice Over and Promo: Lisa Fuson\n\nSpecial Thanks to the creator and founder of the podcast, Tom Sabella, along with Traci Snow for producing and hosting over 100 episodes of the original \"Business Side of Music\" podcast and trusting us to carry on their legacy.\n\nWebsite:\n\nIf you would like to be a guest on the show, please submit a request to:\n\nbob@businesssideofmusic.com\n\nIf youâre interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, let us know and weâll send you a media / sponsorship kit to you.

Itâs in all the latest hot button topic conversations when it comes to the entertainment industry, especially the music business. How is AI going to affect the future of what we do for a living? Will AI replace the live performance? The artist whoâs seeking a record deal? Is this the beginning of the end as we know it, or is it the end of the beginning? Legendary record producer Joe Hand is a guest on this episode, where we take a deep dive into artificial intelligence, and go down various rabbit holes, seeking answers, and coming up with more questions in the process.\n\nCreator and Executive Producer Emeritus: Tom Sabella\n\nShowrunner and Host (the guy who has a face for podcasting): Bob Bender\n\nManagement Representation: Chuck Thompson for Thompson Entertainment Group, LLC\n\nCo-Producer - Audio/Video Editor (the man behind the curtain): Mark Sabella\n\nDirector of Video and Continuity (the brains of the entire operation): Deborah Halle\n\nMarketing and Social Media (all knowing): Sarah Fleshner for 362 Entertainment\n\nAll Around Problem Solver (and Mental Health Therapist for us): Connie Ribas\n\nRecorded inside what could be an old beat up Airstream Trailer located somewhere on whatâs left of Music Row in Nashville TN (Man we sure do miss Noshville, and the Longhorn Steakhouse)\n\nMixed and Mastered at Music Dog Studios in Nashville, TN\n\nEditing and Post at Midnight Express Studio located in Olian, NY\n\nProduction Sound Design: Keith Stark\n\nVoice Over and Promo: Lisa Fuson\n\nSpecial Thanks to the creator and founder of the podcast, Tom Sabella, along with Traci Snow for producing and hosting over 100 episodes of the original \"Business Side of Music\" podcast and trusting us to carry on their legacy.\n\nWebsite:\n\nIf you would like to be a guest on the show, please submit a request to:\n\nbob@businesssideofmusic.com\n\nIf youâre interested in becoming a sponsor for the show, let us know and weâll send you a media / sponsorship kit to you.

Are you seeking out ways to know your fan base better? What about finding ways to market to those fans (and turning them into consumers)? Sometimes, it just feels overwhelming, as though you're trying to boil water in the entire ocean.\n\nJoining us in the studio today is Darshan Kaler, who is the founder and CEO of fan engagement for the technology company Tradable Bits, based in Vancouver, Canada. Also joining Darshan is Shaun Verreault, who heads up Tradable Bitsâ business development (and is lead vocalist and guitarist for the blues-based rock band âWide Mouth Masonâ).
