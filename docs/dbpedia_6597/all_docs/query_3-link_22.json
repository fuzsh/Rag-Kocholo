        "text": "1935\n\nOn January 18, the San Francisco Museum of Art, under the leadership of founding director Grace McCann Morley, opens on the fourth floor of the War Memorial Veterans Building on Van Ness Avenue.\n\nA gift of several hundred artworks from Albert M. Bender, including works by Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, establishes the nucleus of the permanent collection. In a remarkable display of generosity, Bender goes on to donate more than 1,100 objects to the museum, including photographs, and endows its first purchase fund before his death in 1941.\n\n1936\n\nThe museum’s second year begins with an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse — the first on the West Coast — primarily drawn from two local private collections. Many of the featured paintings and sculptures are later donated to the museum, forming the core of an exceptional collection of Fauvism.\n\nThe San Francisco Museum of Art becomes one of the first museums to recognize photography as a fine art by establishing, under the guidance of Curator John Humphrey, a collection of photographic works.\n\n1945\n\nFifty member countries convene in the War Memorial Veterans Building to establish the United Nations Charter. With its galleries commandeered for delegates and press, the museum relocates to a temporary facility on Post Street from March through July.\n\nThe museum presents Jackson Pollock’s first solo museum exhibition. Pollock’s early masterpiece Guardians of the Secret (1943) is added to the collection.\n\n1951\n\nThe San Francisco Museum of Art initiates a biweekly television program entitled Art in Your Life (later renamed Discovery). Embracing the new medium, Morley asserts, “We mean to try to make television serve for art and artists, for that seems the business of our kind of museum.” The series of half-hour shows runs for three years.\n\n1995\n\nSFMOMA’s new building on Third Street opens to the public on January 18, the sixtieth anniversary of the museum.\n\nSFMOMA becomes one of the earliest museums to launch an institutional website.\n\nIn an unprecedented year of collecting, SFMOMA acquires fourteen important Robert Rauschenberg works directly from the artist with the help of funds from trustee Phyllis Wattis. Wattis’s support extends to the museum’s purchase of René Magritte’s signature painting Les Valeurs personnelles (Personal Values, 1952). Other acquisitions include works by Piet Mondrian (the museum’s first), Pablo Picasso, Anselm Kiefer, Brice Marden, Andy Warhol, and Louise Bourgeois, among others.\n\n1999\n\nThe Photography department receives more than one thousand images spanning the full history of the medium from the Prentice and Paul Sack Photographic Trust, as well as eleven rare works by the American Precisionist photographer Charles Sheeler.\n\nContinuing its collections-growth strategy, SFMOMA acquires twenty-two Ellsworth Kelly works from the artist’s personal collection.\n\nIn honor of Phyllis Wattis, Robert Rauschenberg donates his monumental work Hiccups (1978), which consists of ninety-seven linked transfer drawings on sheets of handmade paper. Wattis also enables the museum to acquire key pieces by Eva Hesse and Brice Marden.\n\n2000\n\nIn December, SFMOMA becomes one of the leading repositories of the work of Sol LeWitt with a major acquisition of nine important wall drawings and structures and twenty-six working drawings, many of which are donated from the artist’s personal collection. The group of acquired works represents all the significant periods of LeWitt’s oeuvre.\n\n2001–2002\n\nIn late 2001 and early 2002, the museum receives seven major works by Frank Stella from the collection of Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson — including the seminal Black PaintingZambezi (1959) — establishing SFMOMA as a major repository of this important postwar artist’s work. The artist responds by gifting a new work from his series The Duel (2001) to SFMOMA in honor of the Andersons.\n\n2009\n\nIn April, SFMOMA announces plans for a major expansion that will provide additional gallery, public, and support space, including larger and more advanced conservation facilities and an expanded library.\n\nIn May, SFMOMA unveils a new Rooftop Garden designed by Jensen Architects in collaboration with Conger Moss Guillard Landscape Architecture. The project, which includes a glass pavilion and two open-air spaces, features a rotating selection of indoor and outdoor sculpture from the museum’s permanent collection.\n\nIn September, Neal Benezra and Charles Schwab, chairman of the board, announce a groundbreaking partnership with Doris and Donald Fisher to provide the Fisher Collection — one of the world’s leading collections of modern and contemporary art — with a home at SFMOMA. The Fisher Collection includes 1,100 works by leading artists including Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Willem de Kooning, Richard Diebenkorn, Sam Francis, Anselm Kiefer, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Gerhard Richter, Richard Serra, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol, among many others.\n\nSFMOMA launches a multiyear Campaign for Art with 195 promised gifts from a committee of nine Bay Area collectors. Some of the artists represented include Diane Arbus, Joseph Beuys, Robert Gober, Eva Hesse, Ellsworth Kelly, Bruce Nauman, Jackson Pollock, Ed Ruscha, and David Smith.\n\n2014\n\nIn February, SFMOMA launches The Artist Initiative — supported by a $1.75 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation — which involves deep collaborations with living artists resulting in a more integrated, evolving approach to conservation and collections research.\n\nIn April, SFMOMA announces the creation of the Pritzker Center for Photography as part of the museum’s expansion. The center will be the largest gallery, research, and interpretive space for photography of any art museum in the United States.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg Philanthropies pledges grant support for SFMOMA’s expanded and reinvented digital strategy, including the implementation of new mobile and on-site technologies to help visitors engage and learn when the museum opens in 2016.\n\n2015\n\nAmerican Icons: Masterpieces from SFMOMA and the Fisher Collection debuts at the Grand Palais in Paris and travels to the Musée Granet in Aix-en-Provence. This exhibition presents for the first time works from both collections showcased in one exhibition.\n\nSFMOMA announces that the new museum will open May 14, 2016."
