        "text": "BobGenderMaleLanguage(s)EnglishName daySeptember 17OriginWord/nameGermanicOther namesVariant form(s)Robert, Bobby, Bobb, BorisRelated namesRobert, Roberta, Bobbie, Bobby, Bobette, Boris, Robbie, Rob, Robin, Rupert, Bert, Rahbert, Roberts, Hob, Dob, Nob, Bobo, numerous other variations\n\nBob is a male given name or a hypocorism, usually of Robert, and sometimes a diminutive of Bobby. It is most common in English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand and some Anglophone African countries.\n\nIt most likely originated from the hypocorism Rob, short for Robert. Rhyming names were popular in the Middle Ages, so Richard became Rick, Hick, or Dick, William became Will, Gill, or Bill, and Robert became Rob, Hob, Dob, Nob, or Bob.[1][2]\n\nIt can also be used as a nickname for the name Vladimir, since a commonly used nickname for Vladimir is Vova which in Cyrillic script (Вова) resembles the name Bob in Latin script; historically, both names (Robert and Vladimir) share the same meaning.[citation needed]\n\nThe name Bob has shrunken in popularity in the past 60 years. In 1960 nearly 3,000 babies in the United States were given the name Bob, compared to fewer than 50 in 2000.[3]\n\nPoliticians and businessmen\n\n[edit]\n\nA-B\n\n[edit]\n\nBob Anderson (Canadian politician) (born 1939), former member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba\n\nBob Anthony (born 1948), member of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nBob Arum (born 1931), American businessman and lawyer\n\nBob Asher (born 1937), figure in Republican Pennsylvania politics\n\nBob Ashley (born 1953), West Virginia State Senator\n\nBob Avakian (born 1943), American communist politician\n\nBob Ballinger (born 1974), member of the Arkansas House of Representatives\n\nBob Barr (born 1948), former U.S. Representative from Georgia\n\nBob Bartlett (1904–1968), U.S. Senator from Alaska\n\nBob Bennett (politician) (1933–2016), U.S. Senator from Utah\n\nBob Beaumont (1932–2011), American automobile businessman\n\nBob Beauprez (born 1948), former U.S. Representative from Colorado\n\nBob Beach (born 1959), West Virginia State Senator\n\nBob Beers (born 1959), politician in Nevada\n\nBob Benzen (born 1959), Canadian MP\n\nBob Bergland (1928–2018), United States Secretary of Agriculture and U.S. Representative from Minnesota\n\nBob Bergren, member of the Montana House of Representatives\n\nBob Bird (politician) (born 1951), politician in Alaska\n\nBob Blackman (born 1956), British MP from Harrow East\n\nBob Bland (born 1982), American activist\n\nBob Born (1924-2023), American businessman\n\nBob Bose (born 1932), former mayor of Surrey, British Columbia\n\nBob Bowman, former treasurer of Michigan\n\nBob Brady (born 1945), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania\n\nBob Brown (born 1944), Australian Senator from Tasmania\n\nBob Brown (Australian Labor politician) (1933–2022), Australian MP from Hunter, New South Wales\n\nBob Brown (Montana politician) (born 1947), former Montana Secretary of State\n\nBob Bullock (1929–1999), Lieutenant Governor of Texas\n\nBob Burns (born 1938), Arizona Corporation Commissioner\n\nC\n\n[edit]\n\nBob Carr (born 1947), former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs\n\nBob Carr (born 1943), former member of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nBob Carr (Florida politician) (1899–1967), mayor of Orlando, Florida\n\nBob Carruthers (politician), former member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly\n\nBob Casey Sr. (1932–2000), Governor of Pennsylvania\n\nBob R.
