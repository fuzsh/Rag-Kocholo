He was President and ongoing member of the Garrett County Holstein Association, member and Chairman of the State Holstein Association for several years, and board member of the Regional Farm Credit Association. He was the first Chairman of the Garrett County Holstein Sale and several subsequent terms. Oren judged dairy shows in Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania and he supported local and regional sales by consigning quality Holsteins. He also served on the Eastern Southern States Board of Directors and Southern States Board of Directors. His ministry focus was very community oriented and he had a passion to reach out to people at a personal level. As such he knew no strangers. “Preach the Word” and “Harvest of Souls” were personal banners which guided and empowered his ministry. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Fannie M. (Maust) Bender; four sons, Bob Bender and wife, Alice, Doug Bender and wife, Julia, all of Accident, Oren Kevin Bender and wife, Kim, Meyersdale, Pa., and Brian D.
