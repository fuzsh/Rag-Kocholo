        "text": "“ Bite my shiny metal ass! „ ~ Bender's most famous catchphrase\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez Sr., designated Bending Unit 22 and also best known by his first name Bender, is the anti-heroic tritagonist of the sci-fi comedy television series Futurama.\n\nIn the series, Bender plays the role of a comic anti-hero, and is described by Leela as an \"alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler\".\n\nHe is, per his own testimony, prejudiced against non-robots, often expressing an urge to \"kill all humans\" except his best friend, Fry; however, he has also committed acts of kindness for humans and others, suggesting he is not truly as evil as he claims.\n\nHe was voiced by John DiMaggio, who also voiced Arthur in Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n\nHis Evil Ranking[]\n\nWhat Makes Him Heinous?[]\n\nIn an early episode, when Zoidberg finally gets a stable home, Bender swindles him, and makes him homeless again.\n\nHe has already murdered hundreds of humans, robots, and aliens.\n\nIt's also heavily implied that he raped two robot prostitutes, and that he attempted to rape Amy one night after he thought they're a couple.\n\nHe flushed Nibbler down a toilet in a fit of jealous rage.\n\nHe took advantage of a really bad situation and attempted to kill all humans on Earth.\n\nHe doesn't feel worried when Hermes tries to commit suicide by jumping off a high point and even tells him to do a flip.\n\nHe manipulated a planet into thinking he's a god, and then enslaved its people and imprisoned his friends.\n\nHe is a master thief, and one of the biggest ones he pulled off was when he stole money from all the needy and people people/robots.\n\nHe shot Professor Farnsworth with a laser gun multiple times, morally wounding him.\n\nIn \"Bender's Big Score\", he was responsible for responsible for causing too many time paradoxes, which led to the space-time anomaly to rip open.\n\nHe sold his firstborn son and threw him in the fire of Robot Hell for a demonic army to reclaim the humans from the other dimension.\n\nHe aided Leo Wong in his pollution plan.\n\nHe has stolen human bodies from graves and sole them for benefit.\n\nHe had put naked pictures of Leela and Amy on the internet.\n\nIn \"Ghost in the Machines\", he convinces Robot Devil to let him haunt and murder Fry to get his body back and turns on Beezlebot possessing Robot Devil's body in order to do so.\n\nHe made the entire world drunk which resulted in multiple counts of murders and property damage.\n\nHe became so jealous of Yivo, that he formed an army of the damned making the entire universe go back to hatred and suffering just because he wanted Fry back.\n\nHe became a virtual pirate and stole valuable internet information.\n\nHe helped Nixon in his mass murder and dictatorship over America.\n\nHe committed various other smaller acts.\n\nHe is so vile that Robot Devil pointed out that there’s no robot worse than him.\n\nWhat Makes Him Inconsistent?[]\n\nDue to the comedic nature of Futurama, he is way too comedic to be Pure Evil or Near Pure Evil as his crimes are rarely taken seriously.\n\nHe is on & off.\n\nHe cares for a multitude of people:\n\nHe has a genuine friendship with Fry and, although there are various moments of him treating the latter like dirt, it is very apparent how big of an impact he has on his life. One of the best demonstrations of this is in Bender's Big Score where after celebrating the fact that he supposedly killed Fry after being brainwashed by Nudar, he immediately breaks down crying after the realization dawns on him, only to be overjoyed when it turns out that he's still alive.\n\nWhile not to the extent of Fry, he cares for the other members of Planet Express.\n\nAlthough reluctant to look after him at first, he genuinely loves his son Ben, participating in and having fun doing illegal activities with him after realizing how much they have in common. He also sacrifices Ben's memories of him so he could also become a bender and was left heartbroken from the ordeal.\n\nHe was genuinely in love with Angleyne and decided to save Flexo despite his feelings because he wanted her to be happy.\n\nHe has other smaller preventions, such as Pet the Dog and Honorable moments.\n\nAlthough it varies depending on the episode, he is shown to have standards. Most notably in Space Pilot 3000 where he was anguished over the discovery that the girders he bended were being used for suicide booths to the point where he attempted to take his own life.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez is, alongside Beavis and Butt-Head and The Network Head, one of the four Comedy Central Inconsistently Heinous characters to not come from South Park.\n\n[]\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez on the Villains Wiki\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez on the Heroes Wiki\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez on the Futurama Wiki\n\nNavigation[]\n\nInconsistently Heinous\n\nCanon\n\nBender Bending Rodriguez | Fishy Joe | The Big Brain\n\nNon-Canon\n\nTuranga Leela (Dial L For Leela)\n\nSee Also\n\n20th Century Inconsistently Heinous | The Simpsons Inconsistently Heinous\n\nInconsistently Heinous\n\nAnimated Features\n\nThe Demon | Martin Brisby | Rameses | The Toad | Sour Kangaroo | Tai Lung | Gallaxhar | Boggis, Bunce and Bean | Humpty Alexander Dumpty | Chantel DuBois | Beerus | Bender Bending Rodriguez | Dave | Gorg Commander | Gavin | Professor Poopypants | Melvin Sneedly | Orson | Dr. Fry\n\nLive-Action Features\n\nThe Man With No Name | HAL 9000 | Leatherface | Darth Vader | T-800 | Pinhead | Dark Helmet | President Skroob | Hannibal Lecter | Candyman | Jason Voorhees | Tyler Durden | Magneto (New Version - The Original Timeline) | Count Dooku | John Kramer | Amanda Young | Durza | Carrie White | Agent 47 | Andrew Detmer | Richmond Valentine | Deadpool | Koba | Red | Chucky | Antwan Hovachelik\n\nAnimated Television\n\nItchy | Sideshow Bob | Lyle Lanley | Cecil Terwilliger | Groundskeeper Willie | Kang (IX | XVI) | French President | Glenn Quagmire | Peter Griffin | Bender Bending Rodriguez | Carter Pewterschmidt | King Snorky | Bertram | Adolf Hitler | Homer Simpson (XIV | XVII | XXII | The Fat in the Hat) | Stan Smith | Roger Smith | Mr. Burns (XVI | XXVII) | Dark Stanley | Dr. Blowhole | Kuchikukan | Emperor Carter | Darth Stewie | Viggo Grimborn | Dagur the Deranged | Penelope | Sideshow Bob | Rachel | Jelly Monster | Bart Simpson | Krusto D.
