        "text": "Facts\n\nLucas paid $975,000 for two lots on the Isle of Palms in South Carolina, where he intended to build single-family homes. None of the local authorities had yet imposed any restrictions on the use of the property, which stood on unstable ground subject to flooding and erosion. Two years later, the state created the Beachfront Management Act, designed to halt the march of erosion on South Carolina beaches. It imposed a blanket rule against building any habitable improvements on property that was closer to the ocean than a certain line on the Isle of Palms that connected points particularly vulnerable to erosion. The prohibited area included the lots that Lucas had bought, although he had not built houses on them yet.\n\nLucas argued that the law resulted in a government taking of his property without just compensation, although he did not argue that the law itself was unconstitutional. He succeeded in the lower court, which imposed a damages award of over $1.2 million on the state, but the South Carolinea Supreme Court disagreed and withheld compensation.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nAntonin Scalia (Author)\n\nWilliam Hubbs Rehnquist\n\nByron Raymond White\n\nClarence Thomas\n\nScalia identified two common situations in which courts typically find that a taking has occurred. These are when the government has caused a physical incursion onto private property and when the government has acted in a way that removes all economic or productive use from the land. He found that there was an exception to the second category when the activity on the land constitutes a nuisance that causes harm to the general public. Some of the Court's earlier decisions had applied a test for these types of takings that investigated whether the state regulation advanced an legitimate government interest related to land use. However, Scalia felt that it was time to depart from this style of analysis. He argued that the state could justify virtually any land use regulation under the theory that it would further the public good or combat a public harm, since there is a virtually infinite range of ways in which the public good may be compromised, depending on the perspective of whoever is evaluating it. As a result, he proposed a stricter standard in which compensation would be required for the deprivation of all economically beneficial use of property unless the public harm consisted of something that already was illegal under property law on nuisances. He remanded the case to the state court so that the state could have an opportunity to identify a pre-existing law that Lucas would violate if he developed his property.\n\nConcurrence\n\nAnthony M. Kennedy (Author)\n\nPointing out that Scalia had identified a standard but not actually resolved the case, Kennedy was less certain from the evidence presented whether Lucas actually intended to develop the property. He also felt that Scalia had gone too far in assuming that the property had lost all of its economic value without enough information in the record to support that conclusion. Kennedy would have preferred a more subjective analysis that would determine value based on the reasonable expectations of the property owner.\n\nDissent\n\nHarry Andrew Blackmun (Author)\n\nBlackmun was satisfied that the regulation was enacted to protect the property and lives of the state's citizens from the serious threat of erosion. He felt that Lucas had not presented any compelling evidence to challenge that rule. Blackmun also suggested that the majority had erroneously shifted the burden of proof in Fifth Amendment cases from the property owner to the state, which now was required to justify the judgments of its legislature.\n\nDissent\n\nJohn Paul Stevens (Author)\n\nStevens argued that the majority had adopted too stark a rule and too narrow an exception to it. He observed that it was unfair to absolve the state of paying any compensation to a property owner who had lost nearly all of the property's value while requiring the state to pay full compensation to a property owner who had lost all of the property's value. The majority's reliance on traditional common law principles, according to Stevens, also prevented states from modernizing those principles according to the evolving needs of their citizens.\n\nConcurrence\n\nDavid H. Souter (Author)\n\nIdentifying key holes in the record, Souter felt that the case should not have been heard by the court because it did not have enough evidence to make an informed decision.\n\nCase Commentary\n\nThis case produced the \"total takings\" standard under which courts evaluate whether a government's taking of property has eradicated its value for the private property owner. The state ultimately paid compensation to the property owner and sold the lots for development."
