Dodie and Rex will also perform, as Aztec Two-Step 2.0.\n\nLongtime Levitt Pavilion favorite Frank Mastrone (“Phantom,” “Cats,” “Les Miserables”), and Paige Backus and Grace Hutchinson — recipients of the Connecticut Dance School Kevin Gray Scholarship, given in honor of Dodie Pettit’s late husband (a Broadway star in “Phantom of the Opera” and “The King and I” — will also appear.\n\nFor tickets, a full cast list and other information. click here.\n\n=================================================\n\nDave Shea writes: “One of the benefits of a dog who needs walking at 5:30 every morning is being greeted by this brave soul.

Thank you!)\n\nThe town of Westport has put out 2 Requests for Proposals. Both focus on downtown.\n\nA July 29 RFP is titled “Public Engagement/Phase 2: Westport Downtown Plan.”\n\nThe Project Objective reads:\n\nAfter completing a 2015 master plan for downtown Westport, the town of Westport created the Downtown Plan Implementation Committee to oversee its realization. The committee’s strategy and current progress can be seen at downtownwestportct.com.\n\nOver the past several years, executional work has begun, and the first phase is in the construction funding approval stage. Recently, funding was approved to start the second planning and design work phase.\n\nA critical component of this work is public engagement, which will inform both the initial design work and the vet designs before taking them before approval bodies. For objectivity, the Committee desires to hire an outside research partner to perform this work, which will be both qualitative and quantitative.\n\nThe deadline for bids was Wednesday.\n\nLots to do downtown. But where to park …?\n\nMeanwhile, officials posted an RFP yesterday for a “2015 Parking Study Update and 2024 Feasibility Analysis for Structured Parking in Downtown.”\n\nThe overview says:\n\nThe town of Westport seeks a qualified professional to investigate the feasibility of creating a multi-level parking structure in one of 3 alternative locations in the downtown area, replacing existing surface parking and adding additional spaces to accommodate new and evolving re-development.\n\nThe study will include conceptual drawings, schematic plans, and illustrative renderings of possible solutions.\n\nWhere are those 3 areas?\n\nOne is the Baldwin parking lot off Elm Street, between Main Street and Church Lane.\n\nThe RFP notes: “The 2015 plan suggests that the town utilize a portion of the privately owned Avery Street [behind Cold Fusion] lot as part of the potential area available for a parking deck. The analysis should include the feasibility both with or without this private property being available.”\n\nBaldwin lot plan.\n\nThe second proposed site is on Jesup Road, from the Gillespie Center to the area opposite the police station.\n\nThe RFP says: “The 2015 plan suggests that in addition to the town-owned lot … a portion of the private lots behind #100 and #126 Post Road East [behind Bank of America and environs], and #10 Bay St. be considered for a parking deck as well. The analysis should include the feasibility both with or without this private property being available.”\n\nJesup Road plan.\n\nThe third location to be considered is the lower lot behind the police station. It is accessible now from the area just before the upper Library lot, and at the foot of Jesup Road near Imperial Avenue.\n\nAn RFP note adds: “There is currently a needs analysis and feasibility study underway for creation of a combined Public Safety Center elsewhere in yown, implying that the police station may or may not be located at 20 Jesup Road in the future. The analysis should include the feasibility both with or without the Police Department being in this location.”\n\nPolice station plan.\n\nProposals are due September 5.

For half an hour, he spoke strongly and directly about his reasons for proposing a ban in Westport schools — and acknowledging the challenges.\n\nClick below for the fascinating discussion.\n\n==================================================\n\nHomelessness is no laughing matter.\n\nBut “Stand Up for Homes with Hope” sure is.\n\nThe great non-profit — which does so much to fight homelessness and hunger in Westport — hosts an annual fundraiser, with some of America’s best comics. It’s an evening of laughs, for a fantastic cause.\n\nThis year’s featured comedian is Dustin Nickerson. His “Overwhelmed” debut in 2020 is one of the highest rated special on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nHe’s been featured on Comedy Central, Netflix, the Late Show with James Carden, Fox and Hulu, and is heard regularly on Sirius Radio XM.\n\nMark the date: Saturday, September 28 (Quick Center, Fairfield University).

He was in the back yard, near recently burned grass. It was determined he had been performing a “ritual” when he set the grass on diew.\n\nHe posted a $50,000 bond, and will appear August 22 in Stamford Superior Court.\n\nWestport Police also issued these citations:\n\nDriving while texting: 12 citations\n\nTraveling unreasonably fast: 11\n\nFailure to obey traffic control signals: 7\n\nOperating a motor vehicle under suspension: 5\n\nFailure to comply with state traffic commission regulations: 5\n\nOperating a motor vehicle without a license: 4\n\nFailure to obey stop sign: 3\n\nFailure to renew registration: 3\n\nFailure to drive in the proper lane: 2\n\nFailure to insure a motor vehicle: 2\n\nOperating a motor vehicle without minimum insurance 2\n\nSimple trespass: 1\n\nReckless driving: 1\n\nPassing in no-passing zone: 1\n\nFollowing too closely: 1\n\nImproper stop: 1\n\nFalsified marker, license or registration: 1\n\nimproper use of marker: 1\n\nFailure to carry insurance card: 1\n\nFailure to return license: 1\n\nOperating an unregistered motor vehicle: 1\n\nOperating a motor vehicle without tint inspection: 1\n\nIllegal operation by a motor carrier: 1.\n\nTinted windows must be inspected!\n\n=================================================\n\nEvery day, kids hang out at Wakeman Field.\n\nIs this some kind of strange ball they kicked through the goalpost?\n\n(Photo/Cathy Utz)\n\nNope.\n\nJust the sun doing what it does every day: setting.\n\n=============================================\n\nLongtime Westport Rotary Club member Lyla Steenbergen addressed the organization at its Tuesday lunch meeting.\n\nAs chair of the International Giving Committee, she presented an overview of the local group’s current projects.\n\nFor several years, she has helped equip and enlarge a hospital in Uganda.

When school starts next month, they’ll be banned during school hours.\n\nAnd smart watches, too.\n\nThe announcement came in a message to Upper School families and students this week, from head of school Bob Whelan.\n\nHe cited 2 reasons: the devices’ disruption of students’ focus and learning, and their “obstacle to our collective ability to create a more fully engaged learning community, especially one committed to connection and student well-being.”\n\nWhelan notes, “despite real efforts to resist their pull, cell phones/smartwatches capture and hold attention with potent efficiency. Too often, this impedes students’ ability to be present and fully engaged in developing important relationships at school.\n\nStudying hard? Or hardly studying?\n\n“Additionally, while we recognize the many benefits of these devices, their pervasive presence throughout the academic day can significantly disrupt attention, eroding student focus and learning. Research shows that limiting cell phone use during school hours leads to better academic outcomes, a greater sense of student well-being, and a more positive school climate.”\n\nAfter talking with schools that have adopted phone-free environments — and seen improvement in learning and engagement — GFA formulated a plan.\n\nThe school will provide each Upper School student with a Yondr pouch. As they enter the building, a staff member will lock their devices inside.\n\nStudents will keep the locked, magnetic storage bags in their backpack or locker, until the end of the day. As they leave, staff members — stationed at various exits — will unlock them.\n\nEach student is responsible for bringing his or her Yondr pouch to and from school every day.\n\nAs Greens Farms Academy students stream into school this fall, they’ll begin a new routine: turning off, then locking their phones.\n\n“We recognize that adapting to a cell phone/smartwatch-free environment will take some time for both students and parents,” Whelan wrote.\n\n“We also understand that circumstances will arise that require parents to reach their child during the school day. Please be assured that parents can utilize the Upper School Office to pass on messages to students in a timely manner.”\n\nYesterday, Whelan expanded on the decision.\n\n“My thinking has evolved,” he admitted.\n\n“I used to think, ‘technology will be a feature of these kids’ lives. How can we help them understand and use it?'”\n\nOver the past couple of years, however, he has been “haunted” by the realization that app developers engineer their products in an “incredibly compelling” way.\n\n“We have a big responsibility to teenagers, at this crucial developmental stage when their brains are wiring themselves in the most significant way since they were toddlers,” he said.\n\n“I don’t envy kids. They’re trying to develop relationships and skills, while competing with this incredibly powerful device.”\n\nAs he, his administrators, and GFA counselors, staff and athletic director studied the issue, they realized “it’s almost like kids are being held hostage to their devices. And we’re not serving them well if we enable this.”\n\nSchools that have already implemented no-phone policies offered “reassurance,” Whelan said. “When everyone was away from their devices together, everyone felt better.”\n\nAfter, of course, an initial “adaptation phase” of 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. Students at those schools “grudgingly” admitted they were glad to give up their phones.\n\nAnd, Whelan was told, “schools become louder. As an educator, you should want that.”\n\nSpeaking of noise: GFA is thinking about students’ free time, without phones.\n\nThey’ve bought ping pong, spikeball, and board games like Uno. They’ll rely on the Student Council to come up with other ideas.\n\nAnything is on the table — anything, that is, that involves eye contact and developing relationships.\n\nWhen Whelan sent out his email, he added Frequently Asked Questions to address emergencies.\n\n“All classrooms and offices have a phone that can call 911,” the document says.\n\n“During classroom orientation, we will ensure that students are aware of the location of landline phones and what to do in the event of an emergency. Additional phones are available outside of the classrooms and throughout the building.”\n\nIt adds that school protocols “have been designed in partnership with local law enforcement and emergency services and are based on research and best practice related to school safety.\n\n“The best thinking about safety, and common sense, recommends that students do not make individual calls, send texts, take videos or pictures, or engage in any other activities on their cell phones during an emergency.”\n\nStudents with a medical condition that is monitored via a phone or watch can work with the school nurse, GFA says.\n\nAddressing concerns of parents whose youngsters “check in” with them during the day, the school offers some gentle advice:\n\nProviding students with the opportunity to navigate the peaks and valleys of the academic day helps to build resilience — a valuable learning opportunity unto itself. We encourage students to partner with trusted adults in the Upper School to address challenges that may arise during a school day.\n\nSchool counselors will help students — and parents — with the “skills and resources needed to navigate this transition.”\n\nAs for students who use phones to access their schedules, GFA notes: “All schedules are available in Veracross, which is accessible to each student through any computer.”\n\nAnother recommendation: printing out 2 copies of the schedule, one for themselves, another for their lockers.\n\nSometimes a high-tech problem can have a very low-tech solution.\n\nNew policy in place, at the Beachside Avenue school.\n\n(“06880” covers education, technology, teenage life — and sometimes, like today, they all intersect.

(I think then we flagged it down at Burying Hill Beach.).\n\nI learned that the Good Humor “man” is a woman. Kathryn has been doing this for 25 years, throughout Fairfield County.\n\nThe truck is an original — circa 1968 — and still running strong.\n\nAs I stopped to talk to Kathryn, other 70-somethings did too. We were all dazzled.\n\nKathryn, the Good Humor woman.

Thank you!)\n\nBack in 2017, “06880” published a story headlined “Mitch & Lisa 4Ever.”\n\nIt noted that back in the day, the Parent Child Center on Hillspoint Road was Hillspoint Elementary School.\n\nChildren’s Community Development Center director Eileen Ward had just found a decades-old love note, scrawled on an art room closet metal plate:\n\nWho, “06880” wondered, were Mitch and Lisa?\n\nAnd did their love really endure, 4ever?\n\nSeven years later, we know.\n\nThe other day, I received this email: “Earlier today, my brother Phil and I were reminiscing about our childhood in Westport. We got on the subject of the wonderful field trips we had at Hillspoint Elementary.\n\n“Somehow, someway, as I searched Hillspoint Elementary school and our names, I stumbled upon your post. I considered adding a comment to the original story, then thought it best to email you directly.\n\n“I am Mitch Freshour, co-author of the clandestine graffiti, along with Lisa Rafter.\n\n“We were childhood sweethearts, and I have fond memories of those young days. I can’t recall the exact year, but we would’ve been in 5th or 6th grade, around 1973 or ’74.\n\nHillspoint Elementary School (Photo copyright/Paul Ehrismann)\n\n“We were cast members in a play, and I remember there being a couple of large refrigerator sized cardboard boxes. During down times between rehearsing and building sets, a few of the ‘couples’ would gather backstage and take turns going into the boxes together to sneak a kiss!\n\n“I’m guessing it was probably during this period that we wrote on the cover.\n\n“I lived at 4 Turtleback Lane, and Lisa lived directly behind our house at 5 Peaceful Lane. One of several enduring memories of that time was hanging out in her basement in the afternoon with the lights out, listening to a Beach Boys LP.\n\n“My family moved to Ohio before I could finish my first year at Long Lots Junior High, so unfortunately I lost track of Lisa. However, I’m 99% sure I found her on Facebook, living in Colorado with her husband and family.”\n\nMitch is still in Ohio. He’s retired, after a 25-year career as a mechanical career with with Honda Research & Development.\n\nHe plans to reached out to Lisa. “It was sooo long ago,” he notes.\n\nHe also wonders what became of the wall plate.\n\nLet’s hope we won’t wait 7 more years for that answer.\n\n(Where else but “06880” could you read this story?
