        "text": "Dear All,\n\nA few thoughts on the Daoism issue:\n\nFirst, I think we need to be cautious with statements such as \"(Daoism) has been dressed in Buddhist garb.\" Obviously, there is something much more complex going on here. Daoism itself, as it came into being in medieval China, drew on traditional Chinese symbols and practices including many of the one's in Mark's list. Things like big dipper worship or five elements may have been important to medieval Chinese Daoists, but should not necessarily be considered inherently Daoist. Moreover, as Christine Mollier's work has recently shown Buddhists and Daoists appropriated and plagiarized from one another so heavily that it is difficult to identify broadly shared practices as uniquely Buddhist or Daoist. Although some things (like taking refuge in the three jewels) may be considered inherently Buddhist, we should be very cautious to assume that all practices and cultic beliefs can smoothly fall into one camp or the other. By the time Buddhism entered Japan, it already had incorporated so many continental (and \"Daoist\") elements that it does not make much sense to use normative Indian definitions of Buddhism to assess whether Japanese practices are \"Buddhist\" or not.\n\nSecond, we need more clarity in the definitions that we use when we speak of Daoism in Japan. As Michael Como describes in detail in his most recent work (the relevant passage on xiv-xv can be downloaded at http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/books/comoWeavingIntro.pdf; I also must confess that I have only read the introduction at this point), Japanese scholars and Western Sinologists employ rather different definitions of Daoism. For the former, Daoism is a catch-all category that includes just about any \"popular\" (another frustratingly problematic term) continental practice. For scholars such as Strickmann, Seidel,and others, however, Daoism is social institution based on ritual lineage that trace their roots back to the Celestial Master. Using this more rigorous definition it is hard to see how Daoism existed in early Japan independent of such institutions. Sinologists have struggled with this issue of the relationship between Buddhism, Daoism, and popular religions for some time and scholars of Japan would do well to pay attention to these recent debates. For some of the more important recent studies, see the works of Bokenkamp, Mollier, Nickerson and Verellen, as well as the classic studies by Zurcher, Seidel, Sivin, Stein, and Strickmann (I can give more detailed bibliographical information to anyone who is interested).\n\nFinally, I would suggest that the question should not be whether Daoism existed in Japan or not, but rather what do we have to gain by using the term Daoist. For me, I see very little pragmatic reasons to use the term, as it seems to imply a coherent religious system that surely did not exist in Japan and also masks the activities of more important actors on the religious stage (such as the immigrant lineage groups that Michael Como studies and the Buddhist clergy who also employed many \"popular\" Chinese practices). I find that using more precise terms such as diviners/divination, astrologers/astrology, exorcists/exorcism, etc. to be more useful than imposing the umbrella term Daoist/Daosim over a broad set of practices that were held in common by several traditions and by ritual specialists functioning independent of any tradition.\n\nI would be equally suspicious of the term Onmyodo and this was discussed in detail at the recent Onmyodo conference at Columbia, but that is a whole other issue that I will leave to other more competent scholars.\n\nThose are just my scattered thoughts on the issue, but I would be particularly curious to hear what others have to say about what the benefits are of using the term Daoism versus the more narrow terms suggested above and how the use of the term Daoism helps our understanding of early Japan.\n\nBest,\n\nBryan\n\nOn Fri 25/09/09 7:17 AM , Mark Schumacher m...@onmarkproductions.com sent:\n\nJL Badgley-san\n\nI would say so, yes, as do many other elements\n\nof modern buddhism in japan.\n\nyin-yang\n\nfive elements\n\n12 zodiac signs\n\n28 lunar mansions\n\nmonkey worship\n\nthree worms, nine parasites\n\nten kings of hell\n\nkoshin worship\n\nmyoken bosatsu (big dipper)\n\nthe list is endless.........\n\nDid it come across as Taoism, or was it co-opted\n\nwith similar concepts in Shinto (as you ask), or Shugendo,\n\nor whatever......that I cannot say.\n\nmark\n\nOn Fri, Sep 25, 2009 at 4:51 PM, Richard Bowring wrote:\n\nRoss Bender is concerned about Daoism in early Japan. This is something that has been worrying me for some time. Part of the problem is the all-inclusive use of the term, which in fact covers a multitude of sins. I have read recent books by Bialock and Ooms with great admiration and excitement since they both fill in a set of obvious lacunae in my own 'Religious traditions', but we have to be careful as to how we use the term. By the Tang there was something we can call an organised Daoist religion in China with a priesthood, but this kind of thing was never accepted in Japan and, as we all know, Shinto replaced Daoism in the common 'Confucianism+Buddhism+X' triad. There can be no doubt that many Daoist elements to do with geomancy, superstition, and other esoteric levers of power were used at court but to call this Daoism given entirely the wrong impression of what was going on. No Daoist temples in Heiankyo indeed. I feel we need another word for this. Richard Bowring\n\nWell, does the yin-yang divination (Onmyodo) fit the bill here at all? It seems to include most of the various religio-scientific ideas that were combined in the Han syncreticism and were blended with the native kami worship. I think the issue with considering it Taoism is the question of whether it was coming across as such. I'd rather say that Taoism co-opted the same concepts that came across and influenced Shinto. I think later on you could say that Taoism came across, especially with later sects of Buddhism (perhaps most famously with Zen Buddhism), but did you originally have the idea of Dokyo coming over? -Josh\n\n\n\nOn Sep 25, 2009, at 6:48 AM, David Pollack wrote:\n\n> On Sep 25, 2009, at 5:51 AM, Richard Bowring wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> I feel we need another word for this.\n\n>\n\n> I'd somehow imagined that onmyōdō was the appropriate word?

And \"onmyōdō\" (at least as found in mid-\n\nHeian onward) is not necessarily what the Onmyō-ryō was tasked with.\n\nThe main duties of the Onmyō-ryō were timekeeping (water-clock and\n\ncalendar), and interpretative (divination, \"official onmyōji\" and the\n\nreading of signs in heaven and earth, the \"tenmon\" specialty). The\n\nmajor divination for the onmyōryō by mid-Heian was the Riu Jin\n\ndivination (Six Elder Water), which as far as I know in China, was not\n\nexclusively associated with Daoism. The major \"observational\n\nastrology\" texts were the Weft Texts, which again: I have a feeling\n\nthat forcing these into the Daoist category is a bit of violence to\n\nthem.\n\nAs a side note on the ritualist aspect that is a major part of\n\n\"onmyōdō\" (or \"religious onmyōdō\") from Heian into Kamakura: some\n\nof the rituals look like they might come from Dong Zhongshu (the 火祭\n\nfor example)--and in that particular ritual's case, the first instance\n\nI've yet found was performed by the Jingikan under order of the court.\n\nAnd the Kamakura Bakufu sometimes ordered star worship, with rituals\n\nwith the same name performed in tandem by onmyōji and monks.\n\nAs Bryan Lowe (apologize if I have the name wrong) wrote, the use of\n\nthe term \"Daoism\" in Western Sinology has become rather circumscribed.\n\nIt is also my impression that \"Confucianism\" is likewise being called\n\ninto question.\n\nI do wonder about what abandoning the \"major religions of Japan\" label\n\ndo to our studies, in both benefit and harm.\n\nApologies for muddying the water further.\n\nKristina Buhrman buh...@usc.edu\n\nPh.D candidate, Japanese history\n\nDepartment of History\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\n> What are considered the best English (or Japanese) resources on the topic\n\n> of Daoism in Japan?

Currently, the two\n\nbest books I could recommend on this topic have I believe already been\n\nmentioned in this topic. They are David Bialock's \"Eccentric Spaces,\n\nHidden Histories: Narrative, Ritual, and Royal Authority from The\n\nChronicles of Japan to The Tale of the Heike\" and Herman Ooms's\n\n\"Imperial Politics and Symbolics in Ancient Japan: The Tenmu\n\nDynasty.\" Both of these studies have much to say on Daoist (etc.)\n\ninfluence in early Japan and are highly recommended. I have both a\n\nfeeling and a hope that these are just the tip of the iceberg, paving\n\nthe way for future studies on Daoism (etc.) in Japan.\n\n> Is Daoism in Japan a dead topic among young new scholars in Japan and\n\n> the West? If yes, why? If no, who/where are the people/places to contact?\n\nIt probably depends on whom you talk to. There has been a boom in\n\nstudies of Onmyōdō (influenced by yin-yang/wuxing, etc,, but not\n\nseemingly related to either philosophical or religious Daoism) in\n\nJapan over the last two decades or so, and the publications that\n\ndoubtlessly resulted in part from this phenomena are far too many to\n\nname----as is a list of their authors. As for young scholars on\n\nJapanese Daoism in the west, I hope to join their ranks soon, but as\n\nI'm still a Master's student, I still have a good amount of work ahead\n\nof me. I'm sure there are other Japanese Daoism (etc.) scholars out\n\nthere though --- if any of you are out there, feel free to chime in!\n\n> Is the ongoing exhibition of \"Taoism Art\" at the Osaka Metropolitan Museum\n\n> really an epoch-making event, as says Nobumi Iyanaga at the Tokyo Center of\n\n> EFEO?\n\n> I think so, yes.

In that sense, even though I have not seen the\n\nexhibition, I would certainly agree with Iyanaga-sensei. While it is\n\npainfully true that there is no clear definition of the term \"Daoism,\"\n\nat the end of the day, \"Daoism\" remains still a label, and the\n\nexhibition still presents a world that at the very least attempts to\n\nbe outside the Buddhist and Shintō realms, while inside the realm of\n\nJapan. The fact that we in the West disagree about what the term\n\n\"Daoism\" implies doesn't make the exhibition any less real or\n\neffective.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n-- Joseph P.

But\n\n> Daoism begins to gnaw away.\n\nThe introduction in the exhibition catalogue, by Saitoo Ryuuichi\n\nclearly states that in organizing this exhibition, the curators and\n\nother people who helped them deliberately adopted a vague or\n\nambiguous definition of \"Dookyoo\": they conceived it as having in its\n\ncore, an institutionalized religion like Buddhism, but with unlimited\n\nborders, including all kinds of elements of Chinese popular religion\n\n(p. 11b of the catalogue).\n\nReturning to Buddhism itself, we can say almost the same thing. I\n\ntake an example: some ten years ago, I wrote two long articles on the\n\nJapanese medieval myth of King Maara of the Sixth Heaven, thinking\n\nthat I was writing on Japanese development of Buddhist mythology. But\n\nthe same myth was studied as an important myth of medieval Shinto.\n\nNow, what was Shinto in medieval times? Was it a Japanese development\n\nof certain aspects of Buddhism? But can we say that these aspects of\n\nBuddhism were \"really Buddhist\"? Here comes at point the criticism of\n\n\"essentialism\". In other words, it is impossible to define \"the\n\nBuddhism\", or, probably any other cultural phenomena, which evolve in\n\nhistory...\n\nThe exhibition of Daoist Art seems to me \"epoch-making\" in the sense\n\nthat it reveals that so many Japanese religious phenomena could have\n\ntraces of Chinese influences having at their core something clearly\n\nand closely related to Daoist ideas. We all knew that Onmyoodoo, for\n\nexample, was based on mainly Chinese elements; we all knew that there\n\nwere many Chinese elements in Buddhist texts imported in Japan. But\n\nwhen all these things are gathered in an exhibition, we are given a\n\nnew, strong incentive for new studies in a certain direction.\n\nJapanese studies always tend to be limited to Japan; but this\n\nexhibition clearly shows that if we don't try to look at Chinese\n\nphenomena, we would not understand Japanese things... It opens a new\n\nperspective in our study field...\n\nThis does not clarify things. But I think this is nearer to the reality.\n\n"
