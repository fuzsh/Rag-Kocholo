        "text": "Now that the dust has settled from the MLB trade deadline and players are getting back into their normal routines, it’s time to check in with this week’s Fantasy Baseball Stock Watch to see whose value is rising and whose is on the decline. If you find yourself in contention for your league’s championship, it’s probably been a chaotic week for you on the fantasy baseball waiver wire. While we didn’t see much in the way of marquee talent traded, there were plenty of smaller deals made which have altered the landscape.\n\nTeams that added talent should certainly have players on the rise in value, but even more importantly, teams that sold assets now have to fill those roster spots with potential talent from within their farm system. That, obviously, opens the door for plenty. While I am always in favor of minor tweak deals, you can also look at this new influx of talent as a potential asset for your own league’s trade deadline and the first step in actually acquiring a player with more star power.\n\nCheck your league rosters and all the teams who are vying for the title this year. Some of them missed out on waivers last week. Some of them are still looking to fill some holes. So, if you have the roster space to continue maneuvering, this could be a great opportunity to add a couple of guys and put together a nice package deal for someone. With that, let’s play a little ‘3 Up, 3 Down’.\n\nFantasy Baseball Stock Watch: Risers\n\nColton Cowser, OF Baltimore Orioles\n\nGavin Lux, 2B Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nLuis Garcia, 2B Washington Nationals\n\nFantasy Baseball Stock Watch: Fallers"
