The name Eden means "place of pleasure and delight." It is a magical, peaceful name with biblical roots and Hebrew origins.

According to the bible, the Garden of Eden was God's gift to the first humans Adam and Eve. As the story goes, it was a garden that God intended for Adam and Eve to live in peacefully, contently, and innocently.

The Garden of Eden contained a special tree called the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and Adam and Eve were forbidden by God to eat its fruit.
