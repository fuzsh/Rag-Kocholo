        "text": "This will be a list of some of Japanese animations, movies, OVAs, and TV series that I happen to like and what little I know about them. I won't bother commenting on the films of Miyazaki because there are some very nice web sites on his films. Films such as Totoro and Whisper of the Heart rank in my top 10. Spoilers ahead.\n\nHere are some descriptions of animated films I had some interest in\n\nDagger of Kamui, one great apostate ninja movie, including a trip to Catalina Island. Most of the character designs aren't that original, but check out Kamui's sister. A different set of artists must have worked on her. The portion of the manga translated into English concentrated on a different part of the story. This has finally come out on DVD in the US. (11-28-2003)\n\nDarker than Black (Kuro no Keiyakusha) has a rather contrived and ridiculous premise, but works because of its characterizations. Even the villains have interesting back stories and warrant our sympathies. This is another variation on the Slan by A. E. Van Vogt plot. Due to the contrived spatial anomaly, a breed of Newtypes have arisen, with dangerous X-Men type powers. Like Witch Hunter Robin, they are put to work as assassins by the state hunting each other down, until some of them figure out that they should be working together. ( 1-6-2008)\n\nDesert Rose, 1 episode I've seen.\n\nDetatoko Princess. This is a good example of why you shouldn't buy DVDs based on internet reviews. This is okay if you can see it for free. There are numerous references and cameos from other anime, including Yakumo from 3X3 Eyes and a really whacked out Princess Ayeka. Available on domestic DVD for some reason. (11-10-2004)\n\nDominion Tank Police DVD. More robotic cat girls. Also have the second series on tape, including the last tape. Another dystopic future by Shirow. This one is a little more understandable than most of his stuff. The world is doomed, but no one seems to care as long as they can field some high caliber ordnance. Leona in a Bunny suit? The story is continued in the Manga, with the Puma Sisters eventually joining the Tank Police, much to Leona's dismay. The second half is only available dubbed, but a DVD is promised with all 6 episondes on it. (11-28-2002)\n\nEden's Bowy doesn't get good reviews, but I was hooked as of the second American DVD and I'm up to the 5th of 6. Initially, the style and tone bounce around a lot, but the series seems to be steadying out. In a generally agrarian world, two technological floating cities, Edens,call the shots, although there are forces beyond them. Yorn is a God Hunter (Killer in the Manga) who has powers both Edens want. He's befriended by a swordsman and the mysterious girl Ellissis who has pointy ears and can forge swords with her bare hands. Elissis is a cross between Sasami and Skuld. Overall the show is a cross between Battle Angel Alita and Fancy Lala. The three hanky angle actually comes from some of the ostensible villains, the Wedge siblings, from one of the Eden's, who have an incredibly tragic story. Yorn may be another headstrong male anime jerk, but he wins our sympathy when he declares himself for Elissis even after learning that she's one of the Gods he's supposed to hunt and kill. His counterpart is the person who is supposed to be hunting him, Fennis. She has the same monomanaical desire to save her beloved, in this case her childhood friend Hairra who has been transformed into a puppet. There is also a manga that is pretty raunchy. The comic relief and SD is wasted on this show since Juuni Kokki has demonstrated that a dead serious presentation can work. (11-28-2003)\n\nEl Hazard Anime:\n\nEl Hazard OAV . Ifurita, yes. That's all you need to know. Also have seen the 2nd OAV series, which features another Ifurita. We find that they were a generic weapon. This Ifurita is a good guy, which is just as well because we learn that there were even worse weapons and the bad guys have them. The Ifurita design pops up in the new Bubblegum Crisis.\n\nEl Hazard, the Alternative World, DVDs 1-4 for a 3rd OAV series. This one is highly disappointing and the 13th episode is downright perverted. It was a special episode created after the TV series ended. One gets the feeling that things had to get wrapped up very quickly at the end, including both the plot and art. But then, why did they waste the time and resources on that awful 13th episode?\n\nThe Wanderers, tapes 1-7 El Hazard cleaned up for TV, sort of. At first I thought that this was a poor cousin, but it's actually pretty good if you watch it all the way through. There's a lot more background info on the priestesses and Alielle is an almost heroic figure who has a schoolgirl crush on Shayla-Shayla. The Jinnai-Nanami sibling rivalry angle is pretty funny. Much nicer to watch without the perverted fan service. This Ifurita makes a good buddy for the princess and it's a pity that she has to stay with the Bugrom. This series is on DVD now. (10-20-2002)\n\nEscaflowne ! Another one you have to get on DVD (8 total). This is great stuff! Shoujo meets giant robots! The movie version that just came out is sort of a readers' digest version of the TV series in a different continuity. Most of the characters are still recognizable except for Millerna! The DVD for the TV series looks great and you must go buy it. (8-12-2002)\n\nExcel Saga, distributed by ADV. Any series that does a respectful homage to Leiji Matsumoto is okay with me. Maetel appears under the name \"Tetsuko\", or at least half of her appears in one episode. The rest of her is inside of an Anaconda. The other reason for watching this totally off the wall series is the sweet Princess Hyatt who is always dying. Of course, you would never want to meet the psychotic, deluded, and inept Excel herself. If you're a sadist, you'll enjoy watching what happens to Menchi, the dog/emergency food supply. I think I'll skip Puni Puni Poemi (although I did see it at a con).(11-10-2004)\n\nTakahashi Rumiko anime:\n\nFire Tripper, more time tripping from Takahashi.\n\nThe Supergal (Maris the Chojo), Takahashi in a science fiction mood. The Takahashi universe is relatively simple with boorish, stupid males and women who have super powers, such as super strength, immortality, or the ability to give electrical shocks. This time the heroine has overt super strength, but no cash.\n\nFor me, Ranma started to become very repetitive.\n\nLikewise, Inuyasha I dropped after a few tankubons. As I understand it, and from I've seen, the anime follows the manga closely, and also goes on forever, going nowhere. (1-7-2008)\n\nMaison Ikoku is now out on DVD, but I like the manga better. This story went on for a while, but at least had a beginning, middle, and end. No aliens or magic, but a ronin chases after his landlady, ignoring a cute peer. (12-29-2004).\n\nThe Mermaid stories. These are stories are finite, thankfully. They are good, but at least they don't go on forever.\n\nUrusei Yatsura is one of the great classics of anime and manga. Even though it went on forever, it remained intersting and entertaining. Unfortunately only part of the manga has been translated by Viz. Alien princess comes to conquer the earth but falls for a worthless letch who doesn't deserve her, as far as her fan club is concerned.(1-6-2008)\n\nFive Star Stories Unless you're familiar with the manga, this is totally confusing. Fortunately, a beautiful manga edition is being published in English. You can buy it from Kinokuniya.\n\nFrankenstein, yes an anime version on VHS. It's actually not too bad. Strong Christian overtones. Someone actually wrote me about this one.\n\nFushigi Yugi, a few episodes, the OAVs. Seen the beginning and the end. I don't think I need to see all of the middle. Yui is my favorite.\n\nGalaxy Angels is a really stupid and addictive series with episodes that are around 10 minutes long. The Angels are a group of humanoid young women who are supposed to be searching for Lost Technolgy, but couldn't find it even if it's right under their collective noses. Most of the episodes are silly except for one in which one takes on a serious tone in which we learn about the childhood of the oldest character. Food is the theme of the series. Galaxy Angels Z is the second season. (12-29-2004)\n\nGalaxy Express 999 stories and the Reijiverse I saw GE999 at the Nuart 30 years ago and was absolutely floored. I wanted to know more about this style of movie. It took me a while, but...\n\nGalaxy Express 999 The original movie. An animated Catherine Deneuve dressed for the snow country totes her mysterious suitcase as part of an extreme Elektra complex. The GE does seem to have been borrowed from Cordwainer Smith and Kenji Miyazawa. This is the second greatest anime ever made. Where's the DVD? Some have nominated the scene in which Maetel betrays the hero as one of the great scenes of anime.\n\nAdieu Galaxy Express 999. The second movie. That machine world just doesn't want to give up. Mom still thinks she knows what's best for her little girl. A new anime is coming out in America developing the early days of sisters Maetel and Emeraldas, that's only hinted in this video. See below.\n\nNew Galaxy Express 999, Japanese only. Corresponds to what's being printed in Viz.\n\nMaetel Legend from CPM fills in the gap between Queen Millenia and GE999. This DVD is worth the money if you're a real Matsumoto fan. I know it got some bad reviews, but it's great seeing Maetel and Emeraldas as young girls. The tragedy is seeing the wonderful heroine of the Queen of a 1000 Years, along with all of her subjects, transformed into the monster we know in the GE999 movies. We also get the background on why Maetel is so ruthless and has hidden agendas within hidden agendas. This one delivers if you're a Matsumoto fan. (6/22/2002)\n\nGalaxy Express 999 Original TV series. I first saw this on TV in Italy. I found that it was fansubbed into English. It's still a good series after all these years. We get to see how dangerous Maetel really is and how much she enjoys running around in swim suits. (11-10-2004)\n\nQueen Millenia is the seminal Matsumoto film in which the themes and archetypal characters are introduced. I was watching the movie at the Baltimore Otakucon in 2001 and the tape broke right before the end. I finally did get to see the end courtesy of Corn Pone Films. This was both a TV series and a movie. In the US it was also spliced together with a Harlock to make another Robotech style hybrid. (10-20-2002)\n\nHarlock Saga is really weird Reiji transposed to the world of Wagner. Echoes of Queen Millenia.\n\nMy Youth in Arcadia (Harlock) Thinly veiled version of the American occupation of Japan. Learn how Emeraldas got her scar. Classic Leiji. Short version of Endless Road SSX. (8-12-2002)\n\nCapt. Harlock TV, 2 episodes dubbed on VHS. This one takes place after Emeraldas has her kid.\n\nEndless Road SSX The first three episodes of this TV series look great. This one is roughly a TV version of My Youth in Arcadia. (8-12-2002)\n\nQueen Emeraldas DVD rescues the inhabitants of a desert planet.\n\nCosmo Warrior Zero released by Anime Works. It first looked a little strange, but after the first 5 episodes I'm getting into it. This takes place after the Machine People have beaten Earth and a human officer agrees to hunt down Harlock for them. (10-20-2002)\n\nThe Cockpit, English import. Real Reiji and a must for modelers. Skip the science fiction veiling, let's set it right in World War II with Axis heroes. There's a domestic version now, but not yet on DVD. If you're into FSM, there are some good details shots of the inside of a Betty and its cannon mounts. Three unconnected short stories of manly tragedy.\n\nGun Frontier. Harlock in the old American West with a really raunchy version of Maetel. (11-10-2004)\n\nCaptain Herlock is a new TV series that opens with a lot of totally gratuitous fan service.\n\nGankutsuou is surprisingly good, although the psychedelic artwork takes a while to adjust to. Besides the innovative artwork, the writing is fairly good, and the liberties it takes with the original Count of Monte Cristo seem to make dramatic sense. The surprise is that the relationship between Franz and Albert seems to have been penned by Ogiue from Genshiken, while Eugenie is straight in this version. Unlike a lot of big ticket anime series from its period, Gankutsuou has an ending and even an epilogue. This ranks as a must see. (1-6-2008)\n\nThe Girl from Phantasia, no, not porno. Actually very cute. Too bad there is only one episode over here. Cute magical girl is imposed on a male student who doesn't want anything to do with her. Also a manga which has quite a bit of story I've heard. (8-12-2002)\n\nGhibli/Miyazaki/Takahata films\n\nAnn of Green Gables (Akage no Ann) was a long running TV series that takes us through most or all of the Ann books. .I haven't seen it (up to episode 9 only) all but the art work and music are very nice. Only available on HK DVD as far as I know. Part of the World Masterpiece Theater series. Takahata directed and wrote some of the episodes. Miyzaki did layout on early episodes. (12-28-2003)\n\nConan Future Boy, (Mirai Shonen Conan) Japanese only. Early Miyazaki and company. Translated script is available on the Net; see the Miyazaki Web. You can find the tapes at Japanese language video rental shops. The entire series can also be found on subtitled Hong Kong DVDs at a place like Super Collector. I normally don't recommend buying these HK DVDs, but this is probably the only way you'll ever see this. You can see a lot of the precursors of typical Ghibli characters here.\n\n3000 Miles in Search of Mother Another World Masterpiece Theater TV series. In Azumanga Daioh this is the series to which Sakaki is referring when she tries to name the kitten Marco.\n\nOnly Yesterday, (Omohide Poro Poro) OL blues from Ghibli. Very straightforward and nice.\n\nCastle Cagliostro DVD version! A must. Better, go see it in a theater if you ever get a chance. This one just doesn't age. Lupin Sansei in a chivalrous mood. Includes Miyazaki's only blue-eyed heroine. Monkey Punch wasn't much happy with the Miyazaki interpretation of Lupin. Fujiko is also comparatively restrained here.\n\nTanuki Wars Pom Poko, I don't know how Disney is going to release this one. This one has about the strongest eco message (but that's not the reason.) (12-28-2003)\n\nPorco Rosso, yes, a red pig can be romantic and was a very popular cosplay subject at F2K. Disney needs to get this out. DVD for R2 with English subtitles is available at places like Kinokuniya. Understanding that this was Miyazaki's personal statement on middle age makes this one more understandable, especially if you're a middle aged male. Marco, after watching all of his comrades die and the world dominated by fascists, sees himself as no longer human, but a pig, a severe form of alienation, he only overcomes in a rare moment with Gina. (10-20-2002)\n\nPrincess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime) Another $50 Japanese tape, but the DVD is out now. Looks fantastic. Lady Eboshi is one of Miyazaki's best flawed heroines. (10-20-2002)\n\nKiki's Delivery Service, collector's subtitles as well as Disney dub. The original books can be ordered, but haven't been translated yet. Eiko Kadono, the author, has an English version and she is looking for a publisher. Also available in luxury Japanese R2 DVD with English subtitles. (8-12-2002)\n\nLaputa, Castle in the Sky Classic Ghibli, soon to be released by Disney, but definitely with a different title. Finally out from Disney as an R1 DVD without a theater release.(4-23-2003)\n\nYou Can Hear the Sea (Umi ga Kikoeru) A Ghibli made for TV movie that is excellent. Standard sort of dysfunctional teenage love story. Also made as a live action movie.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies from Ghibli; this hurts too much to watch. This is as much of a downer as Dog of Flanders, but also just as excellent. Two orphans starve to death in postwar Japan. American DVD is available and \\ a remastered version is out. (12-28-2003)\n\nNausicaa, seen subbed and as a genuine $50 Japanese tape. This is another must-see and should be on everyone's top-10 list. The manga is even better, but is darker and much more complicated in both plot and themes. The rescue in the air is one of the great scenes in anime. Out on R2 DVD. (12-28-2003)\n\nWhisper of the Heart (If You Listen Carefully, Mimi wo Sumaseba) My all time favorite anime. There is also a 2 volume Manga that you can order. There wasn't a sound from the audience when they showed this at the UCLA animation club. DVD for R2 with English subtitles is available at places like Kinokuniya.\n\nLupin III's Greatest Capers, Catch the robot from Laputa, and one of the heroines is a relative of Nausicaa. Of course, Miyazaki worked on this one.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro Don't need to comment on this one. DVD for R2 with English subtitles is available at places like Kinokuniya. The American version is also out on DVD with only a dub sound track.\n\nGo Panda Go on DVD. More early and delightful Miyazaki. We see some early use of the same symbols he uses in Spirited Away, namely the train in the water.(5-11-2003)\n\nSherlock Hound is really pretty good. Respectful of the Canon. TV series has come to the US. Sherlock does not look like a hound, thank goodness. Some of the episodes may be named after the original stories, but bear little resemblance otherwise. Still this is a valid interpretation of Holmes and better than a lot of live action versions. Watson as a terrier is a great idea and having a cute young Mrs. Hudson is clever. Moriarty appears, but has some weak spots in this version. In the first volume I haven't seen any references to Mycroft. Miyazaki worked on some of the scripts and his Italian collaborator provided the name for a certain red pig. Being released in America on DVD. (8-12-2002)\n\nSpirited Away is definitely an old man's movie, but when the old man is Miyazaki, that's okay. I saw Panda Go Panda right afterwards and the train in the water motif is repeated. The subtitled deluxe official R2 DVD is available at Kinokuniya, and is going for about $15 less than the other Ghibli subtitled releases. Seeing it the second time at the El Capitan Theater in LA was definitely a treat. Spirited Away bagged the Oscar!!! Out on R1 DVD . (4-22-2003)\n\nThe Cat Returns I saw the American debut at the Egyptian, including the live interview with the director, Morita, and producer. This may not be one of Ghibli's greatest, but it is a lot of fun, and very nice to watch. The two cats from Whisper of the Heart return to sweep a young girl off on a Catnapped style adventure. It's Beat Takeshi meets Errol Flynn. The R2 DVD looks great. Some people complain that this is not classic Ghibli, but fans of Whisper of the Heart will love it. (12-28-2003)\n\nPhantom Ghost Ship isn't that great but some of the scenes were done by Miyazaki very early in his career. You can see that his fascination with tanks goes a long way back.(5-24-2003)\n\nGaijin! How did he get in here?\n\nGokudo is a true picaro. He is a total opportunist, with no scruples or allegiances, and he picks his nose and farts in public. He'll even stoop to trying to pimp his companion, the lovely, virtuous, and tough as nails runaway Princess Rubette. Even though we know that she's seeking adventure, we still wonder why she stays with Gokudo. She's also the main reason to watch the show, even when her body is taken over by Gokudo's soul. Her only shortcoming is that she is completely tone deaf. Cartoony swords and sorcery. However, in the end we're surprised that there was an overall story arc and Gokudo becomes quite metaphysical, with the hero turning out to be an archtypal wise-fool who has to make cosmic choices. Rubette remains cool to the end, even as a not very talented idol singer. (12-28-2003)\n\nGreat Conquest Chinese history distributed by the long gone Orion. Kind of made me sleepy.\n\nGrey, Digital Target, Very dystopian future. The manga is also very good, and has more background. The anime is worth watching. It is available on DVD.\n\nI finally decided to make a list of shows I've seen and either disliked or felt weren't worth a mention.\n\nLast Update: 10 November 2004\n\nWeb Author: Doug Ikemi"
