Born with the destiny of bearing god-killing powers, he is the object of Eden's attentionâ€“both as something to study, and something to destroy. Aided by a young magic-wielding girl named Elisiss, her sister Enefeaa, and a swordsman sent from Eden, Jorrne travels to find his way home and to discover the truth behind his power.",
