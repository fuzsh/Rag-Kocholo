        "text": "Episode 4 – Makenshi: The White Etude\n\nWe catch up to the kids and Lisa racing to get to the subway. Presumably this is directly after the last episode, and we’ll confirm as much in a minute or two, but who can say for certain in an episodic show like this: for all you know, they could be implying the cast is coming back from some other adventure! Unfortunately, they miss the train, and the chocobo tells Yu through the feather that the train is utterly unpredictable, and while the chocobo can tell when it leaves (we’ll learn why soon) he has no way of knowing when it will come back to this station, if ever. The cast may be stranded! Cut to opening titles.\n\nAfter the opening credits and Fabula’s introduction, we’re spared a pointless return to the fruit village when the thief that stole Ai’s bag pops out of a trap door right here at the subway station, thinking the party left on the train. This is Fungo, voiced by Marcos Lara, who hasn’t been in much, though he did appear in Get Backers with Shawn Sides. Once unhooded, we learn that Fungo’s species is weirdly smooth, drawn in a simplistic and rudimentary compared to the rest of the cast, which has an interesting effect when you combine it with his child-like voice.\n\nFungo is captured by the party off-screen, and he reveals that he ate Ai’s backpack. Haha, sure, why not! That’s a good way to get it out of the plot now that it’s irrelevant! During his interrogation, Fungo mentions “others” who might know about the subway, and he leads the party down the secret passage from earlier. The “others” turn out to be a small army of men and women in a goofy, grey outfit that’s a cross between ninja clothing and hazard suits, each armed with martial arts and exploding blowdarts. Fungo introduces the party to their leader, Knave, who is a human. Knave addresses his group as the Comodeen, “a new order within Wonderland.” Knave is voiced by Ken Webster, an actor and stage director. We see quite a few familiar credits on his CV that we’ve seen on others: Nadia, Tekken: The Motion Picture, Eden’s Bowy, Mazinkaiser, Metroid Prime 3, and DC Universe Online. I realize a common talent agent or agency is probably responsible for all the casting overlaps we see in FFU, but Webster looks like he managed to be in every possible project these actors have in common! Oh, and I haven’t been mentioning the various Sakura Wars credits that seem to pepper these resumes. I don’t know why I overlooked them at first, but they’re everywhere.\n\nWhile the kids are introduced to the Comodeen, we’ve been cutting away to Makenshi, who is tracking Kaze with Crux’s help. This prompts Makenshi to speak for the first time, so I can finally credit him as J. Shanon Weaver. The usual credits are here: Get Backers, DCU Online (Captain Boomerang, Hush), Devilman Lady… though his most prominent role is easily Kenshin Himura from Rurouni Kenshin.\n\nBack with the Comodeen, Knave is taking Lisa on a tour, explaining that Fungo’s world was destroyed “by Chaos!” When Lisa asks what that means, Knave’s answer is poetic and abstract, seemingly by necessity: he can’t define Chaos! That said, he’s still willing to fight it, since everyone in the Comodeen has lost their worlds to this evil force. This mention of other worlds implies that Knave may be “human,” but he’s no more an Earthling than Kaze or Chocobaba. Knave also asks a critical question: if the Earl is supposedly in charge of the world, but Chaos has consumed multiple worlds and dumped the survivors in Wonderland, what’s the relation between the two, and who’s really in charge? We don’t get an immediate answer.\n\nKnave flirts with Lisa and tries to recruit her to the Comodeen, but they’re interrupted by the arrival of Ai, who has received an abrupt, off-screen costume change into my favourite costume for her, though this isn’t her last. Thanks to the costume change, she looks like an actual adventurer for a stretch, which is more than I can say for Lisa or Yu (Yu never gets a costume change, and complains about it here, as he should!). Ai is accompanied by Knave’s lieutenant, Miles, a woman voiced by Heather Kafka. Kafka has some of the familiar connections: chiefly Devilman Lady and Mazinkaiser. Despite doing a few voice roles from 2000-2003, Kafka seems to have moved to live action since, and has been in a slew of roles, but mostly minor. You might know her from the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, where she played Henrietta, daughter of the Tea Lady.\n\nKnave gives up on recruiting Lisa after seeing how attached she is to the kids, and says the Comodeen will keep their eyes out for the kids’ parents. Just then, the party sees Kaze nearby (Ai addressing him as “Mr. Windmill?”), talking to a young blond man. Unfortunately, we’ll be interrupted by a cutaway before we learn who this is.\n\nJumping away to the Earl, we find him eating some sort of pudding that Oscha insists is made of “failed effort and wasted dreams.” At first this struck me as an eye-rolling “villain” comment about flavour, but in hindsight I think it was some sort of hint… In any event, the Earl’s political business for the day is about the Comodeen, because FUF has the kind of story where things only matter if the protagonists are nearby. Fungus arrives, seemingly restored and at full size, and offers to take out the Comodeen and Kaze. Unfortunately for him, we zoom out to reveal that he’s actually just the size of a doll. He’s re-growing fast, but not fast enough. In the end, the Earl is going to rely on Makenshi to take out the Comodeen.\n\nBack in the underground bunker of the Comodeen, Lisa asks Knave if Kaze has joined his underground resistance, only for Knave to explain that Kaze hasn’t said anything of the sort (knowing Kaze, he probably hasn’t said anything at all), but he does keep sticking around, so maybe that’s a good sign? Just then, the blond man speaks up, and we see that he’s admiring Kaze’s shotgun through a series of visors. We’ll learn in a moment that this is FFU’s Cid, voiced by Robert Newell, live actor and voice actor. At this point, we’re not surprised to see Mazinkaiser, Eden’s Bowy and DC Universe Online on his credits list, though he also played brief bit parts in Prison Break and the Friday Night Lights TV show.\n\nCid takes to admiring the Magun as well, though of course it’s still asleep and Kaze refuses to give him a close look. Kaze simply replies: “This is my heart,” and starts to walk off. Fun fact: according to the concept art included on DVD 1, that’s not a metaphor! The beating heart-like thing in the Magun was literally supposed to be Kaze’s partially-disembodied heart! Yeesh! Lisa tells Kaze off for refusing to talk to Ai and Yu, who clearly admire him, but he ignores her as well. Our hero.\n\nAfter the break, we find Cid still pawing at the group’s possessions, and he’s come across the pocket watch on chocobo’s collar, which he curiously addresses as “Isabelle.” It seems the watch is Cid’s own invention, and he gives all his inventions women’s names. He says it was simply invented to be a watch for a “man I’d never met” (again, more on this later, and from an outside source), but Cid notes that the watch has since been modified. He seems surprised to hear it’s connected to the subway, which he shows a lot of interest in, being surprised that “it’s running now.” Also, everyone is suddenly addressing the subway as “the Ghost Train,” a tenuous reference to the vehicle from FFVI.\n\nBack on the surface, Makenshi tracks Kaze’s trail to a vegetable building on the surface, and he removes his metal mask, revealing that he naturally exhales a strange white mist. After this, he raises a stick he picked up off the ground and blows the building to hell, shaking the Comodeen’s bunker, which is just underneath.\n\nStrangely, no one reacts to this very much, and they’re further distracted when the chocobo announces the Ghost Train is back far earlier than they worried, and Cid offers to take them to it. Even though the kids should be in a hurry about this, they waste time, with Ai announcing that Lisa is here looking for her boyfriend. I’ll remind you that Lisa never confirmed that she was looking for a boyfriend in Ep 1, but she doesn’t say one way or another here. While it’s clear that Lisa “having” a boyfriend irks Knave, the person you really want to watch is Lisa herself, who seems incredibly awkward about this, and says that she’ll deal with her own problems after she’s helped the kids, with no mention of a boyfriend. She’s not very good at lying for someone who’s probably a spy, is she?\n\nFinally, another shake rocks the building and Miles runs in to shout that maybe they should give a shit about this. The party heads off on their own, while Kaze waits, muttering, “He’s above.” Unfortunately, Lisa is so delayed by muttering that the roof caves in on top of her, leaving both her and Kaze essentially alone when Makenshi appears, alongside the White Sword Dragon from the show’s prologue.\n\nThey aren’t alone for long. The Comodeen appear and takes shots at Makenshi, only for him to destroy their explosive darts and somehow shield himself from Kaze’s shotgun. For some reason, this prompts Knave to announce that Makenshi is also from “another world,” though why he can tell from the off is impossible to say. Still, interesting to learn that Makenshi’s isn’t a native Wonderlander, like the Earl’s other henchmen presumably are. Or… are they? Actually, we later learn that Fungus isn’t either, so it may very well be that they’re all just bad guys brought together from a half-dozen or so disparate universes!\n\nKaze continues firing on Makenshi – ineffectively – and begins to experience flashbacks: the subway train tracks collapsing, explosions, and a woman’s face. He growls, “I have been searching for you,” and Makenshi draws his sword, smugly asking, “When did you wake up?” The fighting gets worse and worse, causing the roof to cave in, and Lisa protests to the two of them to stop firing or the Comodeen and kids will die. Kaze announces that he doesn’t care what he destroys or who dies so long as he gets to destroy Makenshi, and he tries to fire the Magun, only for it to fail on him.\n\nSeeing Kaze helpless, Makenshi begins his own form of summoning: he pulls a flask from his belt and slashes it in midair:\n\nEmbraced by the magical tune played by mist…\n\nNow sleep! Silver Étude!\n\nThis spell causes the White Sword Dragon to return and strike through Kaze and leave him collapsed. With nothing left to do, Makenshi replaces his mask as the cave collapses around him, and the episode ends on the spot."
