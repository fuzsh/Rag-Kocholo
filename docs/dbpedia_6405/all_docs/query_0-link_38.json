        "text": "1.\n\nHere To Stay 03:12\n\nI'm gunna face my demons, even if it breaks my legs Even if it breaks my spirit, walking round downtown all day We all got our own reasons, all got bills to pay One day son, you'll get it straight and you won't have to walk this way Wake up and place your bets, wake up and wait in line One day you'll pay off all your debt, I know it ain't the time Changing with the seasons, going it all alone I got friends and when I see em, it feels like coming home, yes it does! Grab a drink, come on by, any time you're getting high Place your bets and get it line, even losers get to try From time to time we'll get it right, ain't that a sweet thought? Sweetheart, I ain't one to lie Gunna take my leave of Winnipeg, get myself a place Off of Highway 5, Mountain Road, someday but not today Find myself some peace of mind, just behind my eyes There's a bluebird waiting to sing her song, and I'm gunna let her fly I used to let her out at night, when everyone's asleep But in my dreams it's broad daylight and I let her kiss my cheek Never thought I'd be the man, that I am today Here I am despite my plans, I think I'm here to stay\n\n2.\n\nToyota 03:02\n\nLoad up the Toyota, put it in drive Burn the whole pay check, get there alive Keep all my receipts, and a hundred bucks cash With a picture of you, under the dash I changed all the spark plugs, fixed all the leaks But I ain't got a window for the passenger seat Now when I'm driving, I get lots of fresh air When it's too loud to talk, you don't seem to care My dear if I'm honest, I hate being honest I hate working hard, but I can't lie to you You told me you loved me and I told you I loved you Now when we're driving, I know that it's true Yes I do... Me and buddy, out marking time In the big city, no work on the line A couple months passed, and we headed home Turning out West, with everything we owned On my way back, I wrote you a song It played in my head, all the way home Now when you hear it, you sing along When I forget the lyrics, you make up your own My dear if I'm honest, I hate being honest I hate working hard but I can't lie to you You told me you loved me and I told you I loved you Now when we're singing, I know that it's true Yes I do... Forget what they told you, about growing up It ain't all that bad if you're living enough Been doing my best, and it feels alright Gunna get right by you if it takes my whole life My dear if I'm honest...\n\n3.\n\nBurn 02:14\n\nI'm packing all my bags, I'm telling all my friends We're moving to a better place, somewhere we've never been And in my dreams it's a big old bus, and it's all packed up with guitars and such We all got enough to roll one up, when we get on stage we burn the place down Burn the place down We burn the place down Burn the place down My lover by my side, my best friend playing slide We hit the last note right, got up in the morning for a red-eye flight No time to waste, no time no chase, When we get on stage we burn the place down Burn the place down We burn the place down (Up on stage we could burn the place down) Burn the place down (Up on stage we could burn the place down) We burn the place down (Up on stage we could burn the place down) Burn the place down (Up on stage we could burn the place down)\n\n4.\n\nMesmerized 03:15\n\n5.\n\nBoy 03:53\n\nWhy don't you take me in your arms? I wanna know how to be held Why don't you take me in your arms? I wanna know how be held Why don't you take me for a drive In my old '95 Your hands on the wheel And me, I'm sitting on the passenger side Watching highway 5 go by I thought about settling down here There's a little spot just past Eden and I believe in it If it takes a couple years I'm going to get it all in I'm going get shit straightened out I'm going to get it all in I'm going to get you figured out Why don't you take me in your arms? Why don't you take me in your arms? Yeah we were feeling pretty cool In the cowboy hats we bought Yeah we were feel pretty cool It's like that movie that we watched We were driving in the sunset like a couple old friends And I dream I made you upset, but I quickly made amends And I thought about the way you looked at me when we first met, And you're looking at me now Boy, let's pay off all your debt and skip town Boy, let's pay off all your debt and skip town Yeah you can drive my '95 Me I'm sitting on the passenger side With the windows open wide and the tape deck playing Trying not to think about our whole lives, I'm just saying Take me in your arms Why don't you take me in your arms? Why don't you take me in your arms? Why don't you take me in your arms? Why don't you take me in your arms? Why don't you take me in your\n\n6.\n\nThree Scenes 02:48\n\nDrove the old '95 into the city Six in the morning must have been about minus fifty We hit some ice, almost died and right about then I realized I didn't wanna fuck around no more Sat down on the back porch with a buddy Looked him in the eye, said \"Baby, if you love me\" When you're down low, you call on me Just say my name and there I'll by When you're down low, you call on me Just say my name and there I'll by It was written on your face sittin' in the kitchen You were in a state, thinking bout your true love wishin' you were kissin' Well my dear friend, I'll tell you this, it's a beautiful thing to have someone to miss Woke up read the news and it pissed me off Said \"Honey let's go downtown, we can join the march, have a little walk\" I held your hand, you held mine, and we both felt better for a short sweet time \"Fuck the cops and their pipelines\" we both felt better for a short sweet time Sittin' back in the cut playin' my guitar Not thinkin' bout much just wondering where you are Try to make it through the next few lines without crying Baby I'm trying I guess I got my fix of the good life Gunna drive out to the sticks in my old '95 Gunna meet you there good God, I swear Can't find true love just anywhere Gunna meet you there good God, I swear Can't get true love just anywhere\n\n7.\n\nThe Way 03:42\n\nYou put my lighter in your pocket You said you had one once but you must have lost it I said that's how it goes, With love and lighters and friends and bands And to tell the truth I just came across it It wasn't really mine to lend But now it's yours You asked if we were friends I said \"Babe of course\" I wouldn't tell no one else What I tell you I wouldn't be running round singing Baby Blue I remember getting way too high On the streets of Amsterdam Looking for the answers and maybe we were finding them That's just the way I... That's just the way I am But maybe I'll change Everything else does So why not me? You finished your smoke And kissed my cheek Told me you were leaving for the week And there's a man In another city And he makes you smile and when you smile you're pretty I mean you're, you're pretty all the time But I know you know that Well I held your hand as we were walking home I was looking for song, You wrote me a verse I was looking for the right words, You found them first Looking for the answers man, and maybe we were finding them That's just the way I am That's just the way I am At least tonight You sent me a text when you got home alright And I turned on the stereo beside my bed Let the music get way inside my head I fell asleep to the sound of your favourite songs I woke up in the morning and put your record on I put your record on You put my lighter in your pocket You said you had one once but I guess you lost it\n\n8.\n\nNever Have 2 Leave 02:34\n\nIs it good enough To just talk about it Can you say enough Without dancing round the issue Baby if you, Come back to me You'd never have to leave You'd never have to leave Does it the sound the same When I say your name Or has nothing changed I know what it's like to miss you Baby if you, Come back to me You'd never have to leave You'd never have to leave You'd never have to leave You'd never have to leave Saving face, Yeah I keep my opinions to myself I don't want to fix you Baby if you, Come back to me You'd never have to leave You'd never have to leave I know what it's like to kiss you Baby if you, Come back to me You'd never have to leave (Never have to leave, never have to leave) You'd never have to leave (Never have to leave, never have to leave) You'd never have to leave (Never have to leave, never have to leave)\n\n9.\n\nEven when the dogs are at the door Even when the tide comes in to shore And when the wind blows the winter up North I know your love keeps me warm Even when they're howling at the gates Even if I took it all on faith And long was my soul for to wait I know your love keeps me safe You've stolen my heart and I don't want it back Cuz half of my heart is all I've ever had Even though it brings me to my knees When you're simply sitting next to me Lord take my eyes for to see I know your love is all I need You've stolen my heart and I don't want it back Cuz half of my heart is all I've ever had There's nothing to know and no one to ask I know your love is where it's at (Where it's at)\n\n10.\n\nUntitled 04:04"
