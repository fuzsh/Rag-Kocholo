The series was originally serialized in Kodansha's Comic Bom Bom magazine from 1995 to 1998; the publisher later collected the individual chapters into seven tankōbon volumes. The series continued in Kodansha's Magazine Z in 1999, under the title KING OF BANDIT JING, known as Jing: King of Bandits: Twilight Tales outside of Japan and ran until finishing in 2005. The story revolves around a teenage boy named Jing who despite his young age is known as the \"King of Bandits\". Along with his partner Kir, a talking albatross, he travels the world in search of new adventures and legendary treasure. Throughout the series the duo manage to pull off impossible heists and outwit countless enemies that stand in their way.\n\nContents\n\nJing king of bandits seventh heaven 1\n\nSynopsis\n\nCharacters\n\nOriginal series\n\nTwilight Tales\n\nReferences\n\nJing: King of Bandits features a motif in the form of references to alcohol. Volumes of the manga are \"bottles\", episodes and chapters are \"shots\", Jing and Kir's special attack is a \"Kir Royal\", and almost every character and location is named after an alcoholic beverage or cocktail.\n\nIn 2002, five of the original seven manga volumes were adapted into an anime television series that totaled 13 episodes. Produced by Aniplex and animated by Studio Deen, the TV series aired on NHK from May 15th, 2002 to August 14th, 2002. The two studios went on to produce a three part original video animation that adapted the fourth volume of the original manga in 2004 under the title Jing: King of Bandits in Seventh Heaven (王ドロボウ JING in Seventh Heaven). Tokyopop licensed both the original manga and Twilight Tales for English-language releases in North America, while ADV Films handled the licensing of the anime series and the Seventh Heaven original video animation.\n\nSynopsis\n\nKing of Bandits Jing is a series of short, usually disconnected stories starring the young boy who calls himself Jing, the Bandit King. Although Jing's reputation seems to extend throughout the universe of the series, many enemies underestimate him, not expecting the \"great\" King of Bandits to be a \"little kid\".\n\nThe stories vary a great deal, especially between the initial manga series and the sequel series, Jing: King of Bandits: Twilight Tales. In the initial series, stories often border on comical and cartoonish. Each arc includes a new treasure or object that Jing is seeking, a woman or girl who accompanies him somewhere along the way on his quest for this item, and an enemy that either wants to protect what it is he intends to steal, or get to it before he does. Settings also vary; Jing travels to a clockwork city, a desert with living lava, and even deliberately gets himself arrested to steal something from inside a maximum security prison, among other fantastic locales. He always escapes in the end of each arc, and always manages to steal his target, although not always in the way that the characters or the reader expects. Each arc also features the upset of some restrictive societal norm thanks to Jing's intervention; rulers are dethroned, prison riots are caused, an entire corrupt religion is reduced to shambles.\n\nTwilight Tales also ran seven volumes. Jing no longer manages to steal every treasure he sets out after in the arcs. In Twilight Tales, more often than not, Jing actually winds up fighting the sought object, or having to destroy it in some way. There is also a short arc featuring Jing's past. In both these childhood arcs, Jing is already calling himself the King of Bandits. There is no fixed ending for either series.\n\nCharacters\n\nJing (ジン, Jin)\n\nVoiced by: Mitsuki Saiga (Japanese); Joey Hood (English)He is the protagonist of the series and The Bandit Boy Wonder. A young black haired thief in a flowing orange trenchcoat, his exceptional skills and dedication are seemingly contradicted by his laid-back manner. He approaches life with a disarming, confident cheerfulness, selecting his targets seemingly on a whim. Because he is such a legendary figure, many people are surprised when they meet him in person, as he is rather small and unassuming at first glance. His skills as a thief, however, are without equal. He travels the world with his best friend, Kir, a talking albatross bird with whom he can combine to unleash the deadly Kir Royale attack, which is a green ball of energy shot out of Kir's mouth. He also holds a hidden retractable knife in his right sleeve and usually uses it when the Kir Royale would be a waste; its worth noting that the knife goes through a small handful of 'upgrades:' as a boy, it seemingly hid oversized kitchen utensils, in the primary series it becomes a simple slightly curved single edged knife, and by the time of Twilight Tales - it is a full blown double-edged blade almost the size of a short sword. He isn't restricted to this however, as he also seems to be capable of turning anything into a weapon, such as wires as seen when he traps attack dogs or an umbrella he uses to diffuse a Kir Royale blast. That said though, his single greatest weapon is his mind - although never really highlighted, Jing is an extremely keen analyst, almost impossibly clever in executing his plans, and most importantly - has a talent for improvising when something actually doesn't work out his way (a rarity in itself). Strangely, his single greatest treasure is a simple green necklace, which never truly has its purpose revealed.\n\nKir (キール, Kiiru)\n\nVoiced by: Ryusei Nakao (Japanese); Ron Berry (English)He is Jing's sidekick and partner in crime, a feisty talking avian with a big mouth. Despite being a bird, he is constantly chasing human women, and usually hits on each episode's Jing Girl at every opportunity. Nonetheless, he is always rejected (curiously, the rejection is always due to his mannerisms and personality, and not the fact that he is a bird). Kir is a bit greedier than Jing and often wonders why the latter doesn't go after targets with more monetary value. Nonetheless, he is a steadfast friend and invaluable partner to Jing. As noted, Kir is Jing's primary source of firepower - when fused onto his right arm, he can fire a large ball of energy aptly named 'Kir Royale,' it should also be noted that although seemingly infinite in power - Kir has shown exhaustion over firing too many in a sequence. In this fused form, Kir can also grant Jing some limited flight. In a certain chapter involving a porvora delivery, it is seen for the first and only time that Kir is not unique to his species; mines around the world that Jing takes place make full use of these birds for demolition purposes - as such, the question is whether or not the Kir Royale is any stronger than that of his brethren's blasts.\n\nPostino (ポスティーノ, Posutiino)\n\nVoiced by: Shin-ichiro Miki (Japanese); Gary Haddock (English)He is the only other recurring character, and is a good example of the series' surreal tone. Postino is a mail carrier who travels by motorcycle, and whose route seems to include the entire world. He appears, seemingly on cue, at some point in each episode just as Jing is in need of help. He drives up, delivers a clue or plot exposition, and then drives away, and is not seen again for the remainder of the story. Postino is both a parody of Deus ex machina plot devices, and an example of the surreal and sometimes illogical world which Jing inhabits. Postino appeared only once in the original manga, in the \"Amarcord\" story. He appears twice in the Twilight Tales series, once in volume one, and once in volume five.\n\nOriginal series\n\nVolume 1 - Chapters: 1st shot - in the City of Thieves, 2nd shot - Mystery of the Phantom Ship, 3rd shot - the King of Bandit's Test, 4th shot - No Time for Adonis, early design collection.\n\nSummary: Jing enters the City of Thieves with the intent of stealing the Double Mermaid, but Mayor Cognac is dead set on standing in his path. Jing secures the help of some local bandits, and launches a surprise attack on Cognac's lighthouse. He then travels to Blue Hawaii, and with the \"help\" of Rose, law-enforcer-in-training, investigates a ghost ship that has been plaguing the town. It is revealed to be the secret casino Morte Calon, and the proprietor, Grappa, is determined on trapping the King of Bandits with his own desire—But his plan backfires. Lastly, Jing visits Adonis, the city of tyrannical time, with the intention of stealing the fabled clockwork grapes. When Kir saves a girl named Mirabelle from execution for being tardy, he arouses the anger of Mastergear, ruler of Adonis, who has an integration partner of his own—a fox by the name of Sherry, comparable in power to Kir, but nowhere near as loyal to her master.\n\nVolume 2 - Chapters: 5th Shot - The Flower of Neverland, 6th shot - How to Steal Time, 7th shot - The Clockwork Grape, 8th shot - The Most Dangerous Cargo, 9th shot - Incandescent Memories, Jing: King of Bandits initial setup collection (2)\n\nSummary: The battle with Jing and Mastergear continues when Sherry discovers Jing's weakness. Jing and Kir split, and Jing makes a quick get away by hanging on a pendulum. Sherry locates him quickly, but before Mastergear can strike a final blow, Jing is saved by Mirabelle. Jing and Kir wake up in Neverland, where they meet the one-handed Captain and his gang of tardiness escapees. It is not long before Mastergear sends Clockodile to kill the troupe, starting with Mirabelle. When Clockodile kidnaps Mirabelle, however, Jing tracks them down and kills the monster, as well as leaving a note for Mastergear. Jing returns Mirabelle to Captain's gang, and sets out to steal time, on his way evading the Eggnog team, a group of renegade roosters. When Mastergear wakes from his somewhat pleasant sleep, he finds the clocks stopped, and flower petals are floating from the hour glass, which is the town's power source. He destroys the glass and everyone in town goes crazy, giving Jing enough time to get to the clock tower, which holds what he had come for. Captain and the gang show up and open the door with a key made to fit Captain's missing hand, and Jing leads Mirabelle through the tower, which is filled with giant grape vines. Once finding the clockwork grape's \"Wild Bunch\", a bunch looking like crystals, Mirabelle aids Jing when Mastergear ambushes them. Jing and Masterdear fight on the final level of the clock tower, Jing coming out the victor. Sherry leaves Mastergear's side and he is crushed beneath the tower. Jing, Mirabelle, and Kir make it out in time, and Jing leaves without saying a word. Jing then plans to travel to Sungaria carrying a cage of Porvoras, nature's dynamite. He meets Izarra, a gunslinging woman out for revenge on the owner of the Sungaria mountains, which is not to Jing or Kir's knowledge. They travel across the solar system of towns and cities until they reach the Venus Source, a crater filled with a type of memory alloy, with only one way across, a small road that goes straight across. Jing loses two of the remaining three Porvora (the fourth one fell from a bridge and exploded) to the magma-like alloy, which blows the road, forcing Jing to come up with another form of transportation through the metal. After some toil, he gets across, the remaining Porvora on his back, Kir following close behind.\n\nVolume 3 - Chapters: 10th shot - the Goddess of Sungaria, 11th shot - Country of Tears, 12th shot - Town of Eternal Life, 13th shot - Lips of an Old Woman, 14th shot - Seven Colors of Ascension, initial set-up collection (3).\n\nSummary: Jing shows up at a Sungarian mine with the Porvora baby in tow and decides to poke through Baron Goblet's library for information on the Sun Stone—but Izarra has her own agenda that might interrupt Jing's plans. Jing then leaves to the City of Corpse, which abruptly loses the crown of its new king. While escaping from the castle, Jing meets Vermouth, an eccentric girl with promises of immortality in an undying city. To find it he has to solve the riddles leading to its location, before the pedantic Pernod and China Lilet can beat him to it.\n\nVolume 4 - Chapters: 15th shot - Seventh Heaven, 16th shot - Prison of Dreams, 17th shot - A Sneeze From the Sun, 18th shot - the Hometown's Whereabouts, Extra Shot 1 - Amarcord First Volume, Extra Shot 2 - Amarcord Last Volume, initial set-up collection (4).\n\nSummary: Jing is incarcerated in the infamous prison known as Seventh Heaven, warded by Maraschino, who has never let a prisoner escape—and who seems to believe that he is either Batman or a vampire. However, Jing is not long in finding Campari, a conjuror who created a dream orb that could crystallize dreams, so that anyone could experience them. Campari does not want to give up the dream orb, and places Jing inside a dream world of Campari's own making, a little more than Jing's freedom is on the line.
