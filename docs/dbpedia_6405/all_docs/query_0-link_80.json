        "text": "I read Edyn as â€˜Edd-innâ€™ which would be bad enough as a boys name but dreadful for a girl ðŸ™ˆ\n\ni prefer the original spelling - Eden. It is traditionally a boyâ€™s name but it has become unisex with I think possibly more girls named Eden.\n\nEden is lovely for a girl, I havenâ€™t met a boy with the name so it sounds feminine to me. I havenâ€™t heard of Edyn before - people might say Ed-in rather than Eed-en?\n\nEdyn is silly.\n\nI like the name Eden. I like its simplicity. It's probably more of a girls' name now but Eden Hazard is out there reppin' the male Edens very well.\n\nEdyn is just stupid.\n\nEden is urgh; like calling your kid paradise. Imagine shouting that across the park at your tantrumming kid, or saying 'Eden stop picking your nose' or any of the other gross things you have to stop kids from doing.\n\nThus is a Hebrew name and I believe the pronunciation is Eh-den, not Ee-den. Know a couple of Eden's pronounced Eh-den and really suits them.\n\nI really like the name Eden for a girl . . . I think it suits both a child & an adult which is always one of my main considerations\n\nI've never come across Edyn and think it's likely to be problematic with both the spelling and pronunciation\n\nEden is fine for both.\n\nEdyn is a scientific constant (in the right notationâ€¦) and would likely be repeatedly spelled incorrectly or mispronounced.\n\nI like Eden for a girl but accept it is traditionally male. Definitely used more often for girls now though.\n\nEdyn is dreadful. I would pronounce Ed-in rather than Ee-den.\n\nI love Eden - but only for a girl. Never heard of Edyn and like others, I would assume a different pronunciation which I'm not keen on.\n\nI've only known male Edens so it sounds very much like a boys name to me, it always surprises me when it comes up on here as everyone tends to think of it as a girls name."
