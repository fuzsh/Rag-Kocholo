        "text": "How do you feel about the name Eden?\n\nMasculine\n\nFeminine\n\nNeutral\n\n0 voters\n\nOn one hand, I‚Äôve only met girls with the name (and you could argue that the association with the Garden of Eden is feminine). On the other, it has trendy sounds that make it fit in with Aiden, Owen, etc.\n\nI didn‚Äôt vote, because while I would expect an [name_u]Eden[/name_u] to be a girl, I love it on both genders! I‚Äôm considering [name_u]Eden[/name_u] [name_m]Philip[/name_m] [name_u]Grey[/name_u] myself and already have [name_m]Caspar[/name_m] [name_m]Nathaniel[/name_m] [name_u]Eden[/name_u] on my list; I think it‚Äôs a very cool name for a boy and also has the cool association of [name_u]Eden[/name_u] [name_m]Hazard[/name_m]. I‚Äôm not sure why but I do like [name_u]Eden[/name_u] as ‚ÄúED-en‚Äù for a boy and ‚ÄúEE-den‚Äù for a girl‚Ä¶ but that may be influenced by the fact that I‚Äôm fairly confident [name_m]Hazard[/name_m] pronounces it ED-en too. It does make me a bit ridiculously happy I‚Äôm not the only one considering it! [name_m]Adam[/name_m] had just as much right to the Garden of [name_u]Eden[/name_u] as [name_f]Eve[/name_f] did, though, which makes it perfect for either gender imo. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve got the guts to use [name_u]Eden[/name_u], but I do love it a lot.\n\n[name_u]Eden[/name_u] pronounced eee den is completely gender neutral.\n\n[name_u]Eden[/name_u] is my sisters top boys name and really works. I love [name_u]Eden[/name_u] for a boy he‚Äôs soft, handsome, whimsical and outdoorsy. I would pair [name_u]Eden[/name_u] with something that leans strongly masculine like [name_m]Alexander[/name_m], [name_m]Theodore[/name_m] and [name_u]William[/name_u]. I love [name_u]Eden[/name_u]! I would embrace him for a boy just like I would embrace [name_u]Wren[/name_u] and [name_u]Lark[/name_u] for boys too.\n\nNeutral leaning feminine due to use, to me, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all to see it on a boy. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever met one, boy or girl.\n\n[name_u]Eden[/name_u] [name_m]Hazard[/name_m] the football/soccer player is a pretty well-known male [name_u]Eden[/name_u], at least in Europe. He pronounces it Ed-en rather than Ee-den.\n\nAs an [name_u]Eden[/name_u], I honestly prefer it as a boys name. To me it‚Äôs definitely solidly unisex, which I like because I‚Äôm not very ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô by typical standards. I pronounce it both EE-den and eh-DEN/eh-THEN (Spanish pronunciation). I think it works really well for a boy, me personally I get a more moody, dark, enchanting vibe from the name instead of bright and green and airy. I will tell you tho that it will get constantly confused for every -den name out there, [name_u]Aiden[/name_u], [name_u]Brayden[/name_u], [name_u]Kayden[/name_u], [name_u]Jaiden[/name_u], [name_m]Zayden[/name_m], etc, along with [name_f]Edith[/name_f], [name_u]Erin[/name_u], etc. I think it‚Äôs worth it though, I love my name ü´∂üèΩ"
