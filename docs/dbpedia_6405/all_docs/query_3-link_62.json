        "text": "WOODWAY, Texas (KWTX) - A 9-year-old Central Texas girl is recovering after a venomous copperhead snake bit her on a knuckle of her right hand two weeks ago in her backyard.\n\nEden Sibley, a third grader at Live Oak Classical School in Waco, spent three days in the hospital and was given four anti-venom treatments.\n\nIt happened as Eden was collecting snails just before noon on a Sunday with her mom, Suzanne, in her flowerbed near the family’s pool. Eden reached down to get a snail and never saw the foot and a half long snake lurking in some nearby monkey grass.\n\n“I didn’t even see it,” Eden said. “I didn’t even see it because the snake was like brownish-reddish, so it blended into the dirt, and there was tall grass all around, and so the snake just jumped at me.”\n\nSuzanne had looked away for a moment when the bite happened. Eden’s dad, Jonathan, was at church while Eden’s two brothers, Jack, 15, and Knox,13, were home and heard the commotion.\n\n“She bent down and that’s when I heard this awful, awful scream that I’ve never heard and she’s yelling ‘a snake just got me! A snake just got me!” Suzanne recalled.\n\nEden said the pain was immediate and intense.\n\n“It took me a couple of seconds to know that I got bitten by a snake,” she said. “My hand immediately felt like fire, like my whole body felt like it was on fire, like fifty bullets going through my hand.”\n\nSuzanne put Eden in the car to rush her to the hospital but wasn’t sure where to go.\n\nWEB XTRA: Guidance on how to prevent - or survive - a snakebite as more copperheads are spotted at Waco’s Cameron Park\n\nA neighbor who heard Eden’s bloodcurdling scream came outside and recommended Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Waco where she knew they kept antivenom on hand.\n\n“She knew this was a hospital run just by the screaming,” Suzanne said. “Her husband is a nurse and I said, ‘where should I go?’ and she said, ‘go straight to Hillcrest.’”\n\nSuzanne said Eden’s hand was swelling quickly.\n\n“She’s screaming, ‘I’m going to die!’ and I’m like, ‘you’re not going to die!’ And she’s like, ‘have you ever known anyone who’s been bitten by a poisonous snake?’ And I’m like, ‘no, but we’re going to get this figured out,’” Suzanne said.\n\nKnox stayed behind and killed the snake, which allowed the family to show medical staff pictures at the hospital.\n\nWhen Eden arrived to the emergency room, doctors wasted no time administering anti-venom.\n\nStandard protocol is to wait and observe the patient’s reaction, but Eden’s was evident.\n\nBaylor Scott and White emergency room physician, Dr. Randy Hartman, said snake bites tend to be tougher on children.\n\n“They’re smaller, they have less blood volume, their immune systems are more reactive and the chance of that body reacting to the venom is just higher,” Hartman said.\n\nEden was then transferred to McLane Children’s Hospital in Temple a few hours later where three more antivenom treatments were eventually administered.\n\nBy this time, Jonathan, had joined the family. He said watching his daughter in so much pain was tough.\n\n“By the time I got there, her hand was almost the size of my hand,” Jonathan said. “It was swollen up really big. That was the hardest part just watching her, the pain. You kind of knew that snakes are bad and snake bites from Copperheads are bad, but I just didn’t know how nasty and painful it really is. How much damage it can do.”\n\nEden’s most noticeable response was a large bubble that appeared on her finger.\n\nSuzanne says doctors told her while hard to see, the bubble was a natural defense against infection.\n\n“They didn’t want it popped because it can cause more infection,” Suzanne said. \" It’s like a natural Band-Aid.”\n\nEden was discharged from McLane Childrens Hospital Tuesday and spent the rest of the week home from school recovering.\n\nShe admits she’s scared to go outside right now. “I haven’t been going outside because every time I go outside my heart just starts racing,” Eden said.\n\nThe 9-year-old has a good prognosis, but her recovery isn’t over yet.\n\n“They’re now worried about her knuckle, her finger not being able to be straight,” Suzanne said. “Just because where it was bitten, she’ll need to do physical therapy or surgery.”\n\nSuzanne and Jonathan say they’re thankful to both hospitals for the good care they received in such a scary time.\n\nThey say they don’t have much advice on preventing snake bites, but they do encourage families to have a plan if the unlikely happens.\n\n“Get to the hospital as soon as possible,” Jonathan said. “We just had a lot of prayers answered.”\n\nAscension Providence Hospital in Waco also keeps antivenom treatments on hand.\n\nWalk in clinics, like Premiere ER in Waco, tell KWTX because of costs and the medication’s short shelf life, they do not."
