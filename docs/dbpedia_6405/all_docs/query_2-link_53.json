        "text": "Hiya Guys! Welcome to Ryuchu's Random Rants (a.k.a. RRR). This is a place where quite literally I'll rant about anything I feel need ranting about. My life, anime, video games, books...etc.\n\nSince this will be full of all my personal opinions, It'll most likely contain spoilers at one time or another, so I guess if there are spoilers...I'll put a warning in the title of the post! (I really wouldn't want to black out a whole post with that black line thingy...that would be weird) ^-^\n\nSo Aywho (I LOVE THAT WORD!), enjoy your time here at RRR and welcome yourself to the secret workings of an insane person!\n\nAnime I'm Currently Watching...\n\nAishiteruze Baby\n\nAnime's I've Watched (If you happen to be curious :D)\n\nScrapped Princess, Ballad of a Shinigami, AIR, D. Gray-Man, Winter Garden, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, Ginban Kaleidoscope, H20 Footprints in the Sand, Seto no Hanayome, Lamune, Kino's Journey, Solty Rei, Kiddy Grade, Melody of Oblivion, Trigun, Elfen Leid, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai, Akikan, Myself;Yourself, I My Me! Strawberry Eggs, Final Approach, Clannad, Chrono Crusade, Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok, Rave Master, Cyborg 009, Angelic Layer, Scryed, Bus Gamer, Paranoia Agent, Please Teacher!, Kanon, Please Twins!, Eden's Bowy, Final Fantasy Unlimited, Shrine of the Morning Mist, Romeo x Juliet, Rumbling Hearts, Angel Heart, Chaos;Head, CANAAN, REC, Bokurano, Sola, Utawarerumono, Speed Grapher, School Days, Bottle Fairy, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, La Corda D'Oro, Amatsuki\n\n\"I looked at my right hand, the hand with which I painted. There was power in that hand. Power to create and destroy. Power to bring pleasure and pain. Power to amuse and to horrify. There was in that hand the demonic and the divine. The demonic and the divine were two aspects of the same force. Creation was demonic and divine. Creativity was demonic and divine. Art was demonic and divine.\" --Chaim Potoko, \"My Name is Asher Lev\"\n\nA Year Review\n\nSo, everyone is posting their 2012 Art Summary and, although I've never participated in the ritual before, I kinda wanted to participate. It was at this point that I recognized a serious problem.\n\nI only posted 7 pictures this year.\n\n...\n\n-_-\n\nWell that plan has gone completely out the window.~\n\nSo instead, I figured I'd just bother your all by posting several sketches/things I never posted from this year. I have a really bad habit of never finishing pictures or if I do finish them, I never post them. So I thought I would subject you all to several of my pictures from the year.\n\nSo yeah, here we go! :D\n\nGemma design stuff!~\n\n...There's not much else to say about this one. ^-^;\n\nThis is the Pokemon character made human...I can never remember the term for it. Anyone want to remind me? Anywho, can you guess which Pokemon she is? Hint: It's a third-gen water type Pokemon.\n\nSome random sketches.\n\nThis was a picture of a girl and some sort of winter spirit (which is why he's not outlines/shaded, 'cause he's not really there).\n\nAnd here's random chibi pictures of the two characters from the previous picture. :D\n\nNope nope nope. No comment.\n\nShe's the main female character from the same story as this character. The wings look kinda wonky 'cause I drew it while I had no access to interwebz and therefor a proper reference on wings.\n\nGoal for the New Year: Actually finish and post the pictures I start\n\nWishing everyone the best in the New Year! <3\n\n~ Ryuchu\n\nP.S. I don't often re-watch anime, but I love Bokurano enough that I'm running it in the background as I write up a short story. All the happy scenes in the beginning become about 100 million times worse! ;^;\n\n(...But you should still go watch it because its an amazing anime~)\n\nLife: 12/30/12 | By: Ryuchu | | Tags: N/A\n\nI'm Back! (And Thank You!)\n\nJust wanted to take a quick moment to let everyone know I'm back and thank them for wishing me well on my Birthday! For everyone going \"Where are you back from?\" (Which...I'm pretty sure that's everyone 'cause I didn't tell anyone on this site I was leaving...) I just got back from a 20 day trip to Germany! It was simply amazing and I loved every moment of it!~\n\nFor my birthday, I was in Germany, which was pretty cool. It was on 12/12/12 and I was turning 21, which was pretty cool. We climbed to the top of a hill to go to a castle, which was pretty cool. But you wanna know the most awesome thing?\n\nI went to go see The Hobbit. Yup. I saw it on my birthday (so before it even came out in The States) and it was in German and I actually understood what the people were saying and it was wonderful!\n\nI'll take the time to respond to all your lovely comments and such, but first I leave you with two very important pictures. First, one of my favorite pictures I took in Erfurt of their Christmas Market there.\n\nAnd second, the haul of chocolate/candy that I brought back with me.\n\nI'll (possibly) post more later if you guys want, but for now that's all you're getting. Well then, I hope you all have a great day! Once more, thank you so much for the birthday wishes! It was very sweet of all of you! :)\n\n~ Ryuchu\n\nLife: 12/16/12 | By: Ryuchu | | Tags: N/A"
