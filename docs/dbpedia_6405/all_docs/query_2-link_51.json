        "text": "I didn't watch attack on the titens because of the action. I watch it because the story is interesting plus the characters are developed! Anyway.... Not really want to argue with you in anime preferances... I'll try watching some of the romantic animes you suggested just to change the pace once in a while\n\nHm. I've heard that \"story is interesting\" bit a few times before, so maybe there's something to it... And maybe my problem with that idea is just that I'm too genre savvy?\n\nWhile watching the first episode, I turned to the friends who were showing it to me, and was like \"So...\" and basically predicted everything about the nature of the titans and who was who and all that, and my friends kind of shifted uncomfortably in their seats and I gave the show another dozen or so episodes out of courtesy but I'm still laughing recalling how hilariously predictable the series was.\n\np.s. romantic animes I suggested? We have very different ideas of what \"romantic\" means I guess! Anyway, it's nice talking about these things.\n\nThe low production values, combined with the inconsistent art design (if I recall correctly, the character design work for the QB franchise is distributed amongst a plethora of artists), killed this one for me. If the fights had been more interesting it might have been saved, but I still wonder why I finished it.\n\nComedy? I'll take your word for it. But man, I just went back and read the post on my blog in which I discussed the first episode of Kanokon. Comedy\n\nI've only ever watched one AMG thing, I think it was the first thing. I was impressed, maybe because my expectations were super low. Or maybe it was just a decently good thing.\n\nI loved this back in high school. I don't know if it would hold up if I went back to it right now, but it's super self-referential and it gives some insight into an intricate and intricately twisted world. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who wants some laughs.\n\nK-On! was weird. The first season (\"K-On!\") was slow and pleasant but also dumb and largely uninteresting. Every exchange between characters felt formulaic, repeating the format of the manga whence the show. (For those not in the know, K-On! was a \"4-koma\" manga, which is a fairly straightforward format in which the story is divided into 4-panel segments that all kind of follow the same structure.) Anyway, the amazing thing for me was that the second season (\"K-On!!\") was totally different. The anime made a huge departure from the manga, dropped the formulaic pacing, and became incredibly touching. It's one of my favorite shows of all time. It really makes you love the characters and care for their struggles and successes.\n\nI feel like I've seen a show with this title. When I search it up on Google Image Search, I feel like I've seen a show with these character designs. Not sure if memory fuzzy, or LovCon super generic.\n\nI have a complicated relationship with Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. I despised it when it was airing, because all these fools were bandwagoning in its support. The aniblogosphere was all into that ****, and Jason Miao and his cronies were trying to coin tasteless terms for the show's \"inventions.\" I fought back against it all and struck out on my own into a deep and dark place of hatred. Then the concert episode aired. I'll never forget it, never forget the moment I watched it, in early summer 2006. I know exactly where I was, what time of day it was. My world slowed to a halt. The instruments were moving; the characters were manipulating them. I'd seen my share of beautiful animation in movies, and Last Exile had been pretty in its own way, but this was above and beyond anything I'd ever seen in a TV series. Kyoto Animation has been blowing minds ever since. (Not to say that Fumoffu wasn't decent for its time, or that AIR wasn't gorgeous barring its character designs.) But the Haruhi story goes on... loved Endless Eight and Disappearance, thought those were both really solid animated works. Still torn on the original series, but eh. We don't need to have all the answers."
