        "text": "The Garden of Eden is not your typical Hemingway. A novel he labored over between the years 1946 and 1961, it wouldn’t see the light of day until 1986, long after its author had passed away. The result was a work that was heavily edited and pieced together, so we will actually never know the full scope of the artist’s vision for this book. I seem to have an obsession, healthy or unhealthy I’m not sure, with the uncompleted novels of some of my favorite writers, such as Kafka’s elusive The Castle and Austen’s intriguing Sanditon. It’s also fair to say that I’m nowhere close to being an expert on Hemingway, as I’ve only read a handful of his short stories along with the novels A Farewell to Arms, The Sun Also Rises, and most recently, a reread of The Old Man and the Sea. While there are plenty more “traditional” Hemingway works that I might have selected as my next read, I was instead drawn to his uncompleted masterpiece. I call it that because while I feel there was more story to tell, I believe that this work was quite ahead of its time. In fact, I’m fairly certain that it never would have made publication during Hemingway’s lifetime. The Garden of Eden tends to divide his readers, as most works by this author tend to do anyway. A novel of dualities, it’s straightforward yet confusing, beautiful but uncomfortable, simple while also thought-provoking. A work shrouded in illusion and nuance, I was polarized in my reading. While it is a radical departure from everything that has come before, it is perhaps the closest readers can get to actually catching a glimpse into its author’s soul.\n\nDespite its title, The Garden of Eden is devoid of any direct Biblical references or scriptures. Of course, most of us are familiar with the place from which this novel gets its name. Otherwise known as paradise, it was a utopia built upon ignorance of the larger world. Once the famed first man and woman took a proverbial bite from the Tree of Knowledge, their lives were forever changed. Their understanding of the nature of sin, or rather how it was perceived in the greater context, would serve as their undoing. As one follows the journey of the three principal characters of this novel, one slowly begins to recognize the parallels to the Biblical story.\n\nThe Garden of Eden tells the story of several months in the lives of a young newlywed couple, comprised of David Bourne, an up-and-coming novelist, and his wife Catherine, a trust fund baby. The novel’s setting is primarily the French Riviera during the calm years between the two great wars. David and Catherine spend their days in this Edenic setting eating food, drinking wine, swimming, and making love. Excess is quite common with the couple in all of their passions:\n\n“Now when they made love they would eat and drink and make love again. It was a very simple world and he had never been truly happy in any other.”\n\nIt’s a rich and free world where it seems the young couple can have anything they want. However, their life together isn’t all sparkling as one may believe. Tensions run high with the couple, such as Catherine’s jealousy over her husband’s success in his writing and all of his press clippings. There is also contention with the writing itself, as Catherine detests David’s tales of African safaris and adventures with his father. Rather, she wants him to only work on the narrative of their lives together. One day, Catherine decides to get a haircut to make her look more like a male:\n\n“You see, she said. That’s the surprise, I’m a girl. But now I’m a boy too and I can do anything and anything and anything.”\n\nInitially, Catherine’s choice is met with humor and playfulness from her husband. David tends to be extremely passive throughout the novel, firing off a witty quip as a coping tool for his concern over his wife’s behavior. Catherine also makes other changes, such as dressing more like a man when she goes out. Then, there are the gender-blurring acts that occur behind closed doors. Catherine, who sometimes calls herself Peter, refers to David as a girl in their bedroom. While Hemingway never spells out the nature of this change to their sex lives, we can make some assumptions:\n\n“He had shut his eyes and he could feel the long light weight of her on him and her breasts pressing against him and her lips on his. He lay there and felt something and then her hand holding him and searching lower and he helped with his hands and then lay back in the dark and did not think at all and only felt the weight and the strangeness inside and she said, ‘Now you can’t tell who is who can you?'”\n\nNow before anyone thinks this is something out of Fifty Shades of Grey, please understand that we are never specifically told what the specific sex acts are that occur. Hemingway’s concrete style of language dissolves into more vague territory. Catherine’s transformation continues as she cuts her hair even shorter, has it dyed silver, and sunbathes incessantly to be as dark as possible. David begins to refer to his wife by the nickname “Devil” possibly referring to her new role as the serpent of wicked temptations.\n\nThe behaviors culminate into Catherine introducing another woman named Marita into their marriage. Marita falls in love with both David and Catherine, and this dangerous relationship accelerates Catherine’s madness. David alternates between hostility and love for the two women, and eventually finds a support system in Marita who takes more of a wife’s role in the relationship. Catherine’s instability is also fueled by her husband’s refusal to continue writing the narrative of their life together on the French Riviera. Instead, David elects to write about his childhood in Africa with his father, a big-game hunter.\n\nDavid Bourne is clearly a representation of the author himself. In fact, many of the passages relate to the craft of writing, in which Hemingway shares some of his own process through his protagonist. Some of the most extraordinary scenes of The Garden of Eden involve David writing himself into his boyhood existence, such as going on an elephant hunt with his father. As they trail the animal, David realizes just how horrible it is to hunt animals. These passages are somewhat perplexing, considering Hemingway fancied himself as a hunter. This further adds to the confusion and complexity of Hemingway as a writer, as a hunter, and as a heterosexual male figure. The climax of the story is heartbreaking as David comes upon the now mortally wounded animal:\n\n“He did not move but his eye was alive and looked at David. He had very long eyelashes and his eye was the most alive thing David had ever seen.”\n\nDavid achieves writing this “hard” story, and the passages are remarkable in their authenticity—David’s story is a good story, perhaps the highlight of the book; it’s not just Hemingway telling us that David wrote a great story, we actually get to experience the story itself as well as the arduous process by which it was made. Through David, Hemingway makes us experience just how difficult the task of writing really is, and then share the fruit of that labor with us. These scenes raise the stakes of The Garden of Eden, revealing how serious David is when he remarks repeatedly that the writing is the most important thing. For him, it outweighs love and surpasses his marriage. These realizations allow for the climax of Catherine’s destructive behaviors to hit the reader full force.\n\nThe Garden of Eden has some serious flaws. For one, it lacks a clear ending. The final chapter feels more like an afterthought than a natural conclusion to events. While it didn’t feel that a happy ending to this situation was in the cards, I would love to see David embrace his true self rather than hiding behind a face of humor and passive-aggressive behaviors. I would want to see Catherine find help for her emotional issues and be able to embrace her true sexuality. I also thought that the third main character Marita was grossly underdeveloped. Despite its shortcomings, The Garden of Eden is a rich story worthy of being read on so many levels: as highly charged erotica, as an important work that addresses transgender issues, and as an important view into Hemingway himself.\n\n“When you start to live outside yourself, it’s all dangerous.”\n\nHave you read this book?
