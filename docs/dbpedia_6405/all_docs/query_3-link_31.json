Its ten original songs tell personal, self-reflective stories about dreams, endearment and adventures, heartfelt but humorous (“My dear if I’m honest, I hate being honest” – from Toyota). The music is acoustic and warm, but it is the truly amazing and captivating lyrics that make this record wantlist-worthy. Listen to The Way for example, a folk song set in Amsterdam, and how an atmospheric scene is created there in a few striking sentences (“I was looking for the right words // You found them first // Looking for the answers man, and maybe we were finding them // That’s just the way I am”).\n\nFor Eden by Boy Golden\n\nFor Eden by Boy Golden\n\nFor Eden is out now digitally, on CD and vinyl LP, through Six Shooter Records."
