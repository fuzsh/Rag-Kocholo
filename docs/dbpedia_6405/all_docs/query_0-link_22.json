        "text": "The story is set in a strange world where two floating cities called Eurgoha and Yanueas slowly circle the globe. The people on the ground named these cities Ëden, and the cities control all the land. A boy, Jorrne, was born on Yanueas, but in his infancy, he was separated from his mother and brought to live on the planet's surface. Although the foisted father that raised him was poor, Jorrne grew into a bright, chipper young man.\n\nOne day, two assassins came to town searching for Jorrne, calling him the last of a long line of God Hunters, and somehow Jorrne's father threatens Ëden. But Jorrne was saved by Elisiss, a cute and young, but nonhuman, swordwoman and the bearded warrior Oyazi. With his father killed by the assassins, Jorrne has no more links to the town, so he takes up with Oyazi and Elisiss, even though Oyazi seems to have an agenda all his own. He and his two new companions decided to go to Ëden so Jorrne can meet his mother again."
