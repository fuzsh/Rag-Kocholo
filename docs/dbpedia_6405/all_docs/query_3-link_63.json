        "text": "Currently, Eden Gough voices one of the lead characters, Plom, in the animated series Pop Paper City for his first major regular voiceover role, with the series aiming to inspire children to enjoy crafts, and Pop Paper City airs on Milkshake! on Channel 5, having premiered in November last year. In August, Eden will be seen playing Young Tao (William Gao) in Series 2 of the Netflix series Heartstopper, and he previously had a guest role in an episode of Lovely Little Farm for Apple TV+ as Eddy, and played regular character David in the popular CBeebies series Apple Tree House, having joined the show in 2018. Eden has also been in the cast of a number of feature films, most recently in The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star as Young Peter (Remy Hii), he played Neil in the 2021 film The Colony, and he worked on the Jim Button screen adaptations â€“ Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver and Jim Button and the Wild 13 â€“ as Ping Pong. Speaking with Eden, he told us about voicing Plom in Pop Paper City, his experience playing Young Tao (William Gao) in the upcoming Series 2 of Heartstopper and his time as regular character David in Apple Tree House.\n\nYou voice Plom, one of the lead characters in the animated series Pop Paper City, can you tell us about the show?\n\nPop Paper City is a crafting cartoon consisting of five characters plus a Helping Hand. We go off on lots of exciting adventures through many different environments and have wide diversity of experiences. Its main goal is to inspire children to make things for fun and enjoy crafting.\n\nHow would you describe Plom and what is he like to voice?\n\nPlom is a fun character made of a purple paper with ONE big eye. I love putting on different voices to bring him to life and a lot of laughter. He can be very excited in episodes and full of ideas, however, he can sometimes be a little clumsy.\n\nHow was it seeing the finished animations for the first time and how has it been working on your first major regular voiceover role?\n\nIt was quite an amazing experience to see the finished product. I couldnâ€™t believe when I heard my own voice on TV, Plom was so alive. I absolutely admire the dedication of the writers and animators. They made it incredibly entertaining to watch.\n\nI did some voiceover for the movies I made before, but to record this cartoon is totally different as I need to say the lines in several different ways so the director can choose the best one to fit the scene.\n\nWhat was it like playing Eddy in an episode of Apple TV+â€™s Lovely Little Farm last year?\n\nBeing Eddy in the Apple TV+ show Lovely Little Farm was fascinating as I was working with real live animals and it was so much fun but some scenes were taking much longer to film as the animals werenâ€™t listening to the instructions.\n\nCan you tell us about your time filming for The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star as Young Peter and what was it like to be part of?\n\nI was very excited to have landed this job as I had watched The Princess Switch 1 and 2 before. It was a very funny movie. In one scene I had to stay up past my normal bedtime and my eyes were heavy. This was my first romantic scene and I remember my co-star was a little shy to hold my hand. That took several takes to finish.\n\nIn 2021, you played Neil in the feature film The Colony, how was it on set?\n\nI was surprised I was sent to Germany for the audition for this job and found out I would be working with such major stars. It was a great experience to see the set built inside a huge warehouse. I still wonder how much water they used to fill the place up. I was well looked after by the crew. In one serious scene, I kept making Nora Arnezeder laugh. She said my serious look was so funny!!\n\nYou played Ping Pong in Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver and Jim Button and the Wild 13, what was the character like to play?\n\nI played a miniature character called Ping Pong, who was the son of the Empireâ€™s chef and I was only 365 days old. He was a clever and lively little chef. His character was a little bit like myself, a cheeky boy, so itâ€™s fun to put myself into the character.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most from filming as Ping Pong and how was it being cast in the feature film adaptations?\n\nI had the most beautifully decorated costume and hat to wear. All my filming was done with green screen and it was a bit weird to act without other people. It was an amazing experience to be in such an important adaptation.\n\nWhat are some of your favourite memories from playing David in Apple Tree House and what was it like working alongside the rest of the cast?\n\nMy favourite memories has to be using crutches. Also, helping my screen dad Kobi tidy the garden and I made him wet with the hose. I was amazed with his man cave shed full of tools.\n\nAll the other cast members were very professional and we had a lot of fun off screen, we played a lot of games after tuition.\n\nDo you remember how you felt finding out youâ€™d booked the role of David and how was it filming for CBeebies?\n\nI remember I was in Leeds Castle camping and Dad got the phone call to confirm I got the job. I was over the moon. It took three auditions to win this role. CBeebies was very good organising everything, from transportation to my tuition. I was well looked after.\n\nWe understand you will be playing Young Tao in Series 2 of Heartstopper for Netflix, is there anything you can tell us about your experience on set of the show and what are you looking forward to for the release?\n\nI was so looking forward to meeting the characters on set. I remember Kit Connor was in the makeup room with us and he asked what my favourite song was and he played on his phone. He made me so welcome and part of the team. I took a lot of photos with all the main characters and I actually look very much like Tao. I canâ€™t wait to see the release and be able to tell people I am part of this series.\n\nHow did you get into acting and was it something you always wanted to do?\n\nMy parents put me in an agency, and then I got my first job very quickly. I found the experience exhilarating and seeing all the equipment on set was overwhelming and I really had so much fun being on set.\n\nWhat are some of your favourite films and TV shows to watch?\n\nI love action-packed dramas and movies. They are very entertaining to watch, it also gives me ideas on how to improve my acting. Some of these shows included Fast and Furious, Mission Impossible and Catchphrase, which I watch with my parents.\n\nHow do you like to spend your time away from acting?\n\nI absolutely love badminton and I play all the time. I am very lucky to be coached by ex-England players â€“ Toby Penty, Aaron Cheng and Gina Bland. I also am learning tennis and I was a runner-up to Play Your Way to Wimbledon this year. I also like going fishing my with my dad and friends. Of course, I play computer games sometimes like a normal child.\n\nWhat are you hoping 2023 brings for you?\n\nI am hoping I will have a chance to film in a Marvel movie or something big in 2023.\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nFollow Eden on:\n\nInstagram"
