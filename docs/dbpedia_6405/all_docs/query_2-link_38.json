Celluloids for live action movies, you know the long strip of film they cut and paste when editing films? Those are the small ones. Standard size cels for TV production are approx. 10 1/2 inches by 9 inches (I measured her for you). There are oversized cels and pan cels which are larger than the standard size for TV too. Film cels are different though. The standard for those is approx 14\" wide by 9\" (from memory), this is because they are made for the widescreen. As with television show cels there are oversized and pan cels occasionally.\n\nOther types of cels are limited reproductions released by studios, chroma cels, fan cels (painted by fans) and hanken cels. Hankens are usually bigger than your average cel and they are used for promos. Things like covers, trading cards.. things like that.\n\nDo beware though, if you get into cel collecting make sure you read item descriptions thoroughly so you know what type of cel it is and if it's a production cel for TV, OVA or film make sure there's a cel number.. on the rare occasion some thoughtless person will crop a cel, removing the number in the process, but no number, no deal. Usuaully means it's a fake.\n\nI don't mind waiting, I'll put her on hold for you. ^_^"
