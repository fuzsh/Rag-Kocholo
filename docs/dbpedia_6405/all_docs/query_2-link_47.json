        "text": "If you’ve gotten here, you likely already have an idea what this all is. Good, good; as much as I love rambling on and on, I don’t like being pedantic and going deeply into how much this should mean to you and how I’m the sole authority on all things anime. On the contrary, this front page is here to set down a few expectations, for myself as well as to let those interested know how I’m looking to approach this.\n\n1) Content\n\nThis blog will solely be for the review of anime. That means that there will be no manga reviewed here, nor will I seek to review anime merchandise of any sort. I have quite enough on my plate with anime that I’d rather not clutter things up by broadening things too much. I will also freely admit that my knowledge of manga is quite low; I am, and always will be, a fan of things that involve pictures that move and have sound.\n\n2) Review Basics\n\nWith very few exceptions, I will only be reviewing Anime available on DVD in the North American market. I DO subscribe to a few online video streaming sites, such as Hulu, but I would much rather review from a stable source that should be available to anyone. I also intend to touch on DVD mechanics in my reviews, which makes the universality of the format in my reviews all the more important.\n\nOn the subject of North American DVDs, that also means that whenever possible, I will be watching and reviewing the English dubbed versions of anime. There are some DVDs that are available subtitle only, and if that’s the case I will certainly watch them that way. You can certainly comment if you want to tell me how superior the Japanese dubbing of an anime is, or how they lost the spirit of a major plot point in the English translation, but I’m of the opinion that the US anime industry has steadily increased the quality of their content over the years, from options to translation to voice actor quality.\n\n3) Format\n\nSince this review is both myself as well as my brother (Tenjobito), the format will be like a discussion between us on the anime in question. I’ll try to always list the number of episodes (or length for a movie) as well as when it was released (both in Japan and America). This blog won’t be giving grades, just general positive or negative things. It’s up to you what’s important in anime or not, we can just say what we thought of each part.\n\n4) Market\n\nFor my last point, I just wanted to touch on the sort of anime that will be reviewed. While I have little wish to discriminate against any sort of anime or pick out one or two sorts, the sort I own is limited in overall scope That said, I will likely cover anime for all ages and tastes. Yes, that does include anime for kids where I have it, anime for girls, as well as anime involving explicit content, be that violence or hentai. I will try to label all my reviews as to what the anime target audience is, and where an anime is for adults, it’ll be noted at the very start.\n\nBurn in Galactic Fire!\n\nAntispiral-kun\n\n========================================================\n\nREVIEW LIST\n\nListed newest to oldest. The banners are links to the individual reviews.\n\n112) MM!\n\nHigh school student Taro Sado comes to realize that he is an extreme masochist and attempts to conceal this from his crush. To fix his problem, he enrolls in his school’s “2nd Volunteer Club”, where Mio Isurugi and the other members attempt to cure him through various “training” regimens.\n\n111) Those Who Hunt Elves!\n\nAn actor, a martial artist, a gun-crazy high school student, and their tank are transported from earth to a world of elves and magic. However, the spell to return them home was botched resulting in fragments of the spell being magically imprinted onto their skin. Their solution: run around looking for elves and stripping them wherever they find them.\n\n110) Samurai Gun\n\nIt is the beginning of the industrial revolution, and feudal Japan is in turmoil. The ruling Shogun are wielding their abusive powers to instill fear and dominance over their oppressed subjects. Beatings, imprisonment, rape and even murder are the adopted tactics chosen to maintain their reign. The bloodshed must end. A group of Samurai have banded together, and, with the development of new weapons and new technology, they have both the will and the hardware to stand up and fight.\n\n109) Twelve Kingdoms\n\nYoko Nakajima, an unhappy high school student, is one day suddenly faced with a strange man who swears allegiance to her. After a battle with demon-like beasts, he then takes her to another world along with two of her classmates. There, her appearance has changed and she can understand the language even though her classmates cannot. But their status as “Kaikyaku” (people who come from Earth) makes them hunted fugitives, so they wander the land of the 12 countries, simply trying to survive and to figure out the reason why they were brought to this world.\n\n108) Moeyo Ken\n\nSet in an alternate version of the Meiji Era, a boy named Ryūnosuke Sakamoto returns to Kyoto from Shanghai with his monster (yōkai) Nekomaru. The law states that in order to live freely with humans, a yōkai must be licensed. The Kidō Shinsengumi Co. Ltd. is responsible for the capture of unlicensed yōkai but must fight with the Tsubamegumi, who resent the new law. It turns out that Ryūnosuke is the son of the owner of the Shinsengumi.\n\n107) Scrapped Princess\n\nPacifica Casull is the most feared and hated person by the followers of the God Mauser. Known as the Scrapped Princess, she is the poison that will destroy the world. To avoid being killed by the zealots of Mauser, Pacifica and her adoptive brother and sister leave the village of Manhurin. Her brother, Shannon, is an expert with the sword while Racquel is proficient with magic. At every step of the way, however, someone is constantly trying to kill Pacifica, hoping to somehow avert the catastrophe that is supposed to befall the world on her 16th birthday.\n\n106) Black Lagoon\n\nOkajima Rokuro is a Japanese businessman…in a town full of Japanese businessmen. His normal day consists of social drinking with clients and being kicked around by his bosses. He finally gets a break though, as he’s sent by his company to the tropical seas of Eastern China to deliver a disc…only his boat gets hijacked by a band of mercenaries that were hired to steal it.\n\n105) Diamond Daydreams\n\nIf a couple sees the diamond dust together, then they will certainly find eternal happiness. Or so it is said. This is a drama about the romances, friendships and conflicts of six girls from Hokkaido and how the diamond dust affects them and eventually links them together in the search for happiness.\n\n104) Blue Gender\n\nYuji Kaido was diagnosed with a serious disease and cryogenically frozen. He wakes up more than 20 years later—and Earth is nothing like what he remembers. A race of alien bugs called the Blue have taken over the planet, and a few select humans have retreated to the space station Second Earth. Yuji is taken back to Second Earth, where he learns that he and the other sleepers will be instrumental in defeating the Blue.\n\n103) If I See You In My Dreams\n\nVirgin 24-year-old Masuo Fuguno is desperately in love with Nagisa Shiozaki, a 22-year-old kindergarten teacher. He is popular among the women, but he truly only has eyes for Nagisa. However, he is a clumsy, thickheaded and gentle man and gets into trouble a lot.
