        "text": "@TeddyBeans see I'm looking at my husband picturing him being called Eden.....then thinking about other grown men in my family seeing if they would suit that name....nope... please don't name a poor child this name Op\n\nDS has a (male) friend called Eden. I think it is absolutely lovely - and would suit either a child or an adult.\n\nI think Reuben is way too common now and Elias and Ezra a bit ‚Äútry hard‚Äù biblical. I can offer you Jotham as an alternative?\n\nNo, and I don't really like it for a girl. It's OK as a surname or name for a garden centre.\n\nReuben - it's not awful but gets misspelt as Rueben, and has the alternative spellings of Rubin and Ruben. Blends into all the R names that are currently popular.\n\nElias - a bit too long and vowelly for my taste. blends in with all El- names that are everywhere\n\nEzra - I can't see the appeal at all.\n\nI can see it working on a blonde little surfer dude, who grows up to be a tree surgeon or outdoor pursuits leader. I think it‚Äôs lovely.\n\nbut if you have a little Mark Corrigan, maybe not so apt\n\nEden for a boy is fine. I'd pair it with an obv masculine name in the middle. People adjust to what they know. Reuben is also lovely\n\nIt's traditionally a boys name.\n\nNot very classy for a girl.\n\nI know an eighteen year old Eden and it really suits him.\n\nI like it but I think it would get mistaken for aiden (which Is boring af) depending on your accent and where you live!\n\nreuben is a sandwich üòÇ Elias to me just doesn‚Äôt sound nice, a bit sci fi maybe?\n\nEzras nice but then there‚Äôs George Ezra (again boring af!)\n\nI must say when I hear Eden it sounds much more like a boys name than a girls name! But I know of girl Edens, just maybe not the prettiest name..?"
