Her debut role was in 1972 playing the role of Solange in Massimo Dallamano's movie of the giallo genre entitled "What Have You Done To Solange?" Though a small role, her delicate and fragile physique got immediate attention. [R. Ian Jane, "Camille Keaton", contained in the 2002 DVD release of "What Have You Done To Solange?"] Robert Marcucci says of her role as Solange, "She truly steals every scene she's in, simply drifting in and out of each of her scenes, her face and mannerisms mysterious and alluring." [ Robert Marcucci, "In Search of Solange", contained in the 2002 DVD release of "What Have You Done To Solange?"]

In November 1972, Keaton was a Playmen playmate of the month. In September 1974, she was on the cover of Playmen. She won the "Medalla Sitges en Plata de Ley" Best Actress award for her performance in "I Spit on Your Grave" at the 1978 Catalonian International Film Festival in Spain.

Filmography

Controversy

*The model used for the front of the DVD cover of "I Spit on Your Grave" is not Keaton—an urban legend persists that Keaton's body-double was in fact Demi Moore, however skeptics say this is unlikely as Moore would have been only 16 at time.

*In the movie "Savage Vengeance" she appears under the screen name Vickie Kehl or Vickie Lahl—strangely, 'Kehl' appears on the DVD cover and advertising materials, whereas 'Lahl' appears on the film credit itself. An urban legend exists that footage in this movie was used without her consent and this screen name was fabricated to cover up her identity.

* Keaton never appeared in the movies "Il Prode Anselmo e il suo scudiero" and "Decameroticus", although she is incorrectly listed as such on a number of movie databases.
