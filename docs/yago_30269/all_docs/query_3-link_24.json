        "text": "Jacksonville is getting a visit from royalty on Saturday.\n\nCamille Keaton, hailed as one of cinema's great \"scream queens\" for her role in the 1978 horror revenge film \"I Spit on Your Grave,\" will be at Sun-Ray Cinema for the premiere of her latest film, \"Cry for the Badman.\" The film was written and directed by Jacksonville native Sam Farmer and was shot in Northeast Florida using a local crew.\n\nThe film is a revenge tale about a woman (Keaton) who doesn't want to sell her homestead. When three men come by with the intent of scaring her into selling, they get a good bit more than they bargained for. It borrows its title from a 1976 Lynyrd Skynyrd song, although the song isn't in the film.\n\n\"We did send letter and press book to (Skynyrd guitarist) Gary Rossington, just as a courtesy, not asking for licensing or anything,\" Farmer said. \"We realize it’s a small swamp down here.\"\n\nThe film was inspired by several true-life stories, but Farmer said the real inspiration is a classic Western. \"It’s patterned after 'High Noon,' really,\" he said.\n\nShooting took place a little over a year ago. Exteriors were shot in Fruit Cove and most of the interior shooting was done in Orange Park, Farmer said. \"Everything was done here, 100 percent.\"\n\nThe film in set in Jacksonville, and Farmer used friends he's made over the years as his crew. Farmer has no formal education in film (\"I went to junior college for like half a year and took one film class, but it was more appreciation than technique.\") but worked at a local television station, WJCT, and learned on the job. He now works at GuideWell Connect, a marketing company that works in the health care industry.\n\n\"Everyone on the crew is local, everyone is from the world we work in commercially,\" he said. \"Since I’ve been working here 14 or 15 years, I have that reliable group of collaborators.\" Farmer said he has shot several short films, but this is his first feature-length production.\n\nThe key moment in the film's development happened years ago, when a friend, nightclub owner Jerry Rosenberg, mentioned that Farmer really should work with his friend, Keaton. She was the key to the whole thing, said Farmer, who added that he probably wouldn't have made the film if she hadn't agreed to be in it. \"“This was entirely written for her.”\n\nKeaton said she was intrigued by the prospect of working with Farmer, but once she read the script, she was in. \"Oh, I love playing parts that have strong females in them,\" Keaton said. \"It was a compelling script to read and it’s a compelling film to watch.\"\n\nKeaton is best known for \"I Spit on Your Grave,\" a gruesome 1978 film about a woman who is gang-raped and left for dead who hunts down her attackers. It was the last film she made where she was the lead character, until the \"Cry for a Bad Man\" script came along. She was in more than a dozen movies, many in the same vein as \"Grave\" (\"Raw Force,\" \"Savage Vengeance,\" \"No Justice,\" \"Blood River\") but spent much of the past 40 years raising a family. She was married to Hollywood producer Sidney Luft for more than a dozen years, until his death in 2005.\n\n\"I was married and I wanted to make my marriage work and that’s the thing that came first. I had some second leads and things like that,\" Keaton said. \"But this is my first film that I can say 'this is my film, I am really the lead.'\"\n\nShe said she spent about 10 days filming and is looking forward to coming back to Jacksonville, since she really didn't see much of it the last time. \"I had a great time working on the film but there wasn’t much time to do anything else. We worked pretty hard.\"\n\nShe still regularly attends horror conventions as a guest of honor and plans to promote \"Cry for the Bad Man\" at upcoming events. Being typecast as a scream queen isn't such a bad thing, she said. \"If you’re going to be typecast, you might as well be typecast for something fun.\"\n\n'Cry for the Bad Man' world premiere\n\n2 p.m. Saturday at Sun-Ray Cinema\n\n$10.25\n\nJAX ON SCREEN\n\n\"Cry for the Bad Man\" is hardly the only film to be made in the Jacksonville area. According to figures from Jacksonville Film & Television, a division of the city's Sports & Entertainment department, the direct economic impact of filming in the region since 2005 totals $38.8 million.\n\nSome notable films made locally:\n\n• \"G.I. Jane\" with Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen. Released in 1997.\n\n• \"Sunshine State\" with Anglea Bassett, Edie Falco and Alex Lewis. Released in 2002.\n\n• \"Basic\" with John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Connie Nielsen. Released in 2003.\n\n• \"Lonely Hearts\" with John Travolta, James Gandolfini, Jared Leto and Salma Hayek. Released in 2006.\n\n• \"The Year of Getting to Know Us,\" with Tom Arnold, Jimmy Fallon and Sharon Stone. Released in 2008.\n\n• \"Recount,\" with Kevin Spacey, Denis Leary and Laura Dern. Released in 2008.\n\n• \"Romance Complicated,\" an Indian film, in the Gujarati language, was partially filmed in Jacksonville. Released in 2016."
