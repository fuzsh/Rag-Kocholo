        "text": "Directed by Meir Zarchi\n\nStarring Camille Keaton, Eron Tabor, Richard Pace, Anthony Nichols, Gunter Kleemann\n\nThis is one that the title alone is remembered sometimes more than the movie. It is one that activists and critics love to point out as cruel exploitations and the way women are treated in horror films. But obviously, they have never seen the film before they lay down their criticism. Because if they have, they would have realized that this is not shown from the point of view of the rapists, but of the victim and of the heinous crime that rape is. That didn’t stop both Siskel and Ebert from trashing it, not only hated the film but Ebert called it “sick, reprehensible and contemptible.” No kidding, Roger. When you have rape as the subject matter, what do you expect? All fun and games? One would have to do is listen to the audio commentary from Joe Bob Briggs and to hear some of the silly stuff that has been said about this title, as well as making you really see the film for what it is."
