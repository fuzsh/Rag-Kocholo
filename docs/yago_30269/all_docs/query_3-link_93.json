        "text": "Back\n\nC Support\n\nKeaton: Wow, this is awesome.\n\nCamilla: Hello, Keaton. I hadn't expected to meet you here, of all places.\n\nKeaton: Oh! Camilla! You're just in time to see something awesome! Look! Look in this hole!\n\nCamilla: That's not a \"hole\" so much a small cave. What did you say you'd found in here?\n\nKeaton: I can't tell youâ€”it would spoil the surprise! Just hurry up and look!\n\nCamilla: I was just about to. There's no need to rush me. Oh my. These bones are...human. And there are so many...\n\nKeaton: Isn't it great? They're so pretty when they've been picked clean like this.\n\nCamilla: Yes, they do seem to have been here for quite some time. Might this be an ancient burial ground?\n\nKeaton: I'd take them all home with me, but I don't think I could carry them all.\n\nCamilla: Why would you bring a bunch of bones home with you?\n\nKeaton: Are you kidding?! They'd be the centerpiece of my table!\n\nCamilla: To each his own...\n\nB Support\n\nKeaton: Camilla, there's an emergency!\n\nCamilla: An emergency? What's happened?\n\nKeaton: No time to explain! It's that bad!\n\nCamilla: Calm yourself, Keaton. If you want my help with whatever it is, you must explain the situation first.\n\nKeaton: Wh-who said I wanted your help?!\n\nCamilla: Suit yourself. In that case, good day.\n\n(Camilla leaves)\n\nKeaton: Camilla, wait! I'm sorry! I'll explain! Don't gooooooo!\n\nCamilla: What seems to be the problem?\n\nKeaton: I can't get back there! You know, to the bone hole!\n\nCamilla: \"Bone hole\"? I hope for your sake that you mean the burial ground you showed me.\n\nKeaton: Yeah, that! I can't get there anymore!\n\nCamilla: You haven't forgotten the way, have you?\n\nKeaton: Psh! Me? I totally know the way! I just keep going around in circles when I try to follow it for some reason.\n\nCamilla: Which is another way of saying you've forgotten.\n\nKeaton: Believe what you want. Let's not get hung up on fiddly details. The point is, I want to see the bone hole again! You do too, right? Who wouldn't?\n\nCamilla: I'll decline. I've never been a connoisseur of human remains.\n\nKeaton: *sniff* So that's how it's gonna be...\n\nCamilla: Oh, very well. Come with me, then.\n\nKeaton: Hooray! I knew you'd be dying to see it again!\n\nCamilla: On the contrary; I'm guiding you there because you seemed on the verge of tears.\n\nKeaton: I-I...I wasn't gonna cry!\n\nCamilla: Then you won't mind if I don't take you there.\n\nKeaton: *sniffle* Nooooo...\n\nCamilla: Hmhmhm. I thought as much. You're adorable when you're pitiful. Shall we be going, then? Follow me.\n\nKeaton: Hmph. I feel...used, somehow.\n\nA Support\n\nKeaton: I can't get over how cool the bones in here are!\n\nCamilla: How long are you planning on staring at those?\n\nKeaton: Man, who knows. You'd think it would've gotten old by now, but it never does!\n\nCamilla: Meanwhile, I was bored hours ago, so I'll be heading back now.\n\nKeaton: W-wait...you're going back by yourself?\n\nCamilla: Unless that's a problem, yes.\n\nKeaton: No, it's just... You might run into trouble on the way home, yeah? Which would be dangerous if I wasn't there with you.\n\nCamilla: I don't run afoul of bandits, dear. They run afoul of me.\n\nKeaton: Hmm...yeah, you'll probably be fine.\n\nCamilla: Keaton, if you don't think you can get home on your own, simply say so.\n\nKeaton: Wh-what a thing to say! Of course I can get home by myself!\n\nCamilla: Excellent. Then I'll be on my way.\n\nKeaton: Urgh... C-c'mon, I'll just be a little longer, and then we can go home together.\n\nCamilla: ...If you insist.\n\nKeaton: Heheh! Sorry, Camilla. But you don't find bones like these just anywhere!\n\nCamilla: Thank goodness for that. Most people would be uneasy around them.\n\nKeaton: Oh yeah? How come? Gosh, if THIS makes them nervous, they'd better never visit my hometown. The whole place is littered with the bones of people I've killed.\n\nCamilla: Erm...is it now.\n\nKeaton: Yep! You can hardly take three steps without tripping over 'em! It's 'cause I killed every last jerk who came to take my pelt.\n\nCamilla: I see. So that's why I detected the stench of blood on you.\n\nKeaton: What?! But that was months ago...and I bathed just last week...\n\nCamilla: A bath won't suffice. The scent of blood seeps deep beneath the surface.\n\nKeaton: Huh. Who knew?\n\nCamilla: It's never bothered me, mind you. I'm only telling you for your information. Now come along, or I really shall leave you behind to find your own way.\n\n(Camilla leaves)\n\nKeaton: W-w-wait up!\n\nS Support\n\nKeaton: Hey, Camilla?\n\nCamilla: What is it, Keaton?\n\nKeaton: I think you need a strong man.\n\nCamilla: You have 10 seconds from the end of this sentence to reconsider that remark.\n\nKeaton: No, no, think about it! You're going to get married someday, right?\n\nCamilla: Only a wolfskin could dig himself this deeply, this quickly.\n\nKeaton: Come on, just hear me out! Whatever man you marry has gotta be strong. A real tough guy.\n\nCamilla: That seems sensible.\n\nKeaton: Right?! Saaaay...how many bandits did I take down by myself the other day? I forget.\n\nCamilla: ...\n\nKeaton: Normally I'd remember, but they were such lightweights, I barely noticed 'em.\n\nCamilla: This can't possibly be what you're driving at, but...\n\nKeaton: Wh-who, me?\n\nCamilla: Are you slowly coming around to asking me to marry you?\n\nKeaton: Whaaaaaat? Pfffffft! Pssssh! Haaaaah! ME? Marry YOU? What a crazy idea I've never thought about before!\n\nCamilla: I see... My mistake.\n\nKeaton: Uh, well, wait! Now that you bring it up...it gets me to wondering if maybe, you know...\n\nCamilla: What is it?\n\nKeaton: Grrrrrrrgh! Fine! You're gonna make me come out and say it, huh?\n\nCamilla: That's correct. I haven't the time for anyone who can't muster the courage to ask for himself.\n\nKeaton: F-fine! You asked for it! ... P-please marry me, Camilla.\n\nCamilla: ...\n\nKeaton: Look! I found a ring somewhere for you and everything! It's a beaut!\n\nCamilla: ...\n\nKeaton: Camilla, you're killing me. Say something...\n\nCamilla: I accept your proposal...if not your ring.\n\nKeaton: What?! Really?!\n\nCamilla: You're a cheerful, friendly fool, and yet... you have that intriguing reek of blood beneath it all. I'm drawn to the parts of you that you're careful to keep hidden.\n\nKeaton: I-I'm not sure what you mean by that, but you're serious? You'll marry me?\n\nCamilla: Gladly.\n\nKeaton: Wow! What a day! Thanks, Camilla! Yesssssssssssss!"
