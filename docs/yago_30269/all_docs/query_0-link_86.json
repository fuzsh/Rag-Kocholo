        "text": "Over 40 years after the controversial exploitation film I Spit On Your Grave was unleashed, director Meir Zarchi is back this year with I Spit On Your Grave: Deja Vu, being billed as the only true sequel to the 1978 rape-revenge movie. In other words, this one has nothing to do with the remake and its sequels, but instead returns to the original film’s continuity.\n\nCamille Keaton reprises the role of Jennifer Hills in Deja Vu, starring alongside Jamie Bernadette as her daughter, Christy Hills. In this wildly unnecessary sequel…\n\nIncensed that Jennifer Hills was vindicated of killing her rapists decades prior, both mother and daughter are kidnapped by revenge-seeking relatives.\n\nMaria Olsen, Jim Tavare, Jonathan Peacy, Jeremy Ferdman, Holgie Forrester, Roy Allen and Alexandra Kenworthy also star.\n\nCheck out the trailer and poster art below. The film will release on April 23.\n\nFrom the team behind the Terrifier movies, Iconic Events Releasing brings Stream to theaters nationwide TONIGHT, August 21, 2024, with limited screenings through August 25.\n\nThe film’s cast is stacked with familiar faces and horror icons, and Variety spills the beans this week that Tim Curry is making a top secret appearance in the gory horror movie!\n\nVariety reports this afternoon, “The veteran actor will return to the big screen as a character in the horror film Stream, which is opening Wednesday in select theaters. It will be his first feature film role since the 2010 comedy Burke & Hare, even though he has worked on many animated projects as a voice actor since then.” Variety notes in their report, “He also appeared in the 2016 television film remake of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on Fox.”\n\n“This has been a really hard secret to keep and contain our excitement, especially for this long,” director Michael Leavy said in a statement. “We are so happy and thrilled to bring Tim back to the movies and back to the big screen! His charm always radiates and shines through everything he does and we are so honored to have him a part of Stream! He is someone I have idolized personally growing up and it is one of the major highlights of my life getting to work with him, especially on a project that means so much to me. We can’t wait for fans to sit back and enjoy our movie in theaters and hopefully with a huge crowd having a blast together! This is the way horror films are meant to be seen and enjoyed. Stream is here to entertain!”\n\nGrab your tickets to see Stream on the big screen now!\n\nDirector Michael Leavy‘s Stream comes from Fuzz on the Lens Productions with the film’s makeup FX being handled by Terrifier and Terrifier 2 director Damien Leone!\n\nThe film’s cast also includes Bill Moseley (The Devil’s Rejects), Tony Todd (Candyman), Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator / Would You Rather), Danielle Harris (Halloween 4, 5 / Hatchet 2), Tim Reid (Stephen King’s IT / WKRP Cincinnati), Dee Wallace (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial / The Howling), Mark Holton (Leprechaun), Felissa Rose (Sleepaway Camp / A Nun’s Curse), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive / Final Destination), Dave Sheridan (Scary Movie / The Devil’s Rejects), Terry Alexander (Day of the Dead / Night of the Living Dead II), David Howard Thornton (Terrifier / Terrifier 2), Charles Edwin Powell (Exorcist III/Screamers), Bob Adrian (The Conjuring 2), Sydney Malakeh (Cheer Camp Killer), Wesley Holloway (Terrifier 2), and Damian Maffei (The Strangers: Prey at Night).\n\n“Stream is a modernized slasher made by horror fans for horror fans and we are extremely excited and honored to be bringing this movie to the big screen for audiences to enjoy together,” Leavy tells Variety. “We have an incredible cast of genre greats who deliver stellar performances, and of course having Terrifier’s Damien Leone and Phil Falcone heading the gore FX we made sure we delivered the goods for our incredible fanbase, but something we are most proud of is its story and arching character development.”\n\nIn the film, “As the Keenan’s try to bring their family closer together, they unwittingly enter themselves into a game of life or death. With four deranged killers patrolling the halls of their hotel and competing for the most creative kills, the odds are definitely stacked against them.”\n\nProduced by Steven Della Salla (Terrifier 2, Abnormal Attraction), Jason Leavy (Terrifier 2, Abnormal Attraction), Michael Leavy (Terrifier 2, Abnormal Attraction, Pennywise The Story of IT), Marcus Slabine (Dark Offerings, Island of the Dead), Damien Leone (Terrifier, Terrifier 2), Phil Falcone (Terrifier, Terrifier 2, Joes War) and George Steuber (Terrifier, Terrifier 2)."
