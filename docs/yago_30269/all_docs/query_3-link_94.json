        "text": "Not content with just a single I Spit on Your Grave franchise, here comes another. This time we’re talking about a direct sequel to the original! Read on for details and the first image.\n\nFrom the Press Release:\n\n37 Years after the release of the controversial 1978 cult classic I Spit on Your Grave, Camille Keaton has reunited with director Meir Zarchi to reprise her role of Jennifer Hills in its direct sequel, I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu.\n\nI Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu is the only sequel that shares characters as well as continuity with the original 1978 motion picture Day of the Woman, aka I Spit on Your Grave.\n\nFollowing her brutal rape, Jennifer wrote a best-selling account of her ordeal and of the controversial trial in which she was accused of taking the law into her own hands and ruthlessly killing her assailants. In the small town where the rape and revenge took place, the relatives of the four rapists she killed are furious that the court declared her not guilty and resolve to take justice into their own hands.\n\nThe original I Spit on Your Grave was inspired by Meir Zarchi’s experience with a victim of rape. After stumbling upon a teenage girl in a park in the aftermath of a violent assault, Zarchi began to imagine how a woman in this situation might fantasize about revenge. Moreover, he wanted to depict to the audience the real horrors of rape.\n\nIn this new chapter, Jennifer Hills is joined by her daughter, Christy (Jamie Bernadette), as well as a variety of new characters, including Maria Olsen, who plays the role of Johnny’s wife, the gas station attendant Jennifer castrated; Jim Tavare in the role of Herman, whose son Matthew was hung by Jennifer; as well as by actors Jonathan Peacy, Jeremy Ferdman, Holgie Forrester, Roy Allen, and Alexandra Kenworthy.\n\n“I always envisioned Camille Keaton returning to continue the saga of Jennifer Hills,” said Zarchi. “Getting together with Camille to film the sequel was a surreal, deja-vu-like experience.”\n\nProduced by Terry Zarchi and Jan O’Connell, I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu is currently in post-production."
