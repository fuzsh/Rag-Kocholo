        "text": "Details\n\nWritten by: Steve Pattee\n\nPublished: 06 March 2019\n\nI SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE DEJU VU TRAILER AND STILLS\n\nOn April 23rd, 2019, Camille Keaton returns as Jennifer Hill in I Spit on Your Grave Deja Vu; the direct sequel to the 1978 cult classic, I Spit on Your Grave (aka Day of the Woman). Also returning is director Meir Zarchi, who helmed the first film as well as serving as producer on the Anchor Bay Trilogy (2010 to 2015) of I Spit on Your Grave.\n\nZarchi also penned the latest entry in the franchise and in addition to Keaton, stars Jamie Bernadette (The Furnace; Hear No Evil), Maria Olsen (Starry Eyes; Mark of the Witch; Trophy Heads), Jim Tavare (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), Jonathan Peacy (American Nightmares), Jeremy Ferdman (Dirty Talk), Holgie Forrester (Darby Forever; The Wrong House), Roy Allen (Fox FX series, The Age of Living Dead), and Alexandra Kenworthy (Gilmore Girls).\n\nFor lack of a better word, I enjoyed both the original film and the remake (although I have not seen the two following the 2010 remake). Love it or loathe it, I Spit on Your Grave has an important place in film history and the 2010 version is suprisingly violent. I freely admit I didn't think it was going to be as brutal as it is. I'm definitely interested in where this goes, especially since both Keaton and Zarchi are back together.\n\nYou can pre-order the film on Amazon starting March 7th, 2018.\n\nJennifer Hills is back!\n\nForty years after 1978’s I Spit On Your Grave shocked the world with its story of a beautiful career woman assaulted and left for dead, and her notorious revenge on those responsible, cinema’s most lethal lady vengeance returns in the most anticipated sequel of all time. Reuniting star Camille Keaton and original director Meir Zarchi, I Spit On Your Grave Deja Vu sends now successful writer Jennifer Hills hurtling back to where it all began – to face the wrath of the families of those she murdered. Kidnapped along with her daughter Christy ( Jamie Bernadette), it’s a tense game of hunt – or be hunted – against a ruthless gang of degenerates overseen by a violently unhinged matriarch Becky, (Maria Olsen).\n\nMeir Zarchi delivers the next explosive saga in the most controversial tale of an eye-for-an-eye ever committed to celluloid. Some grudges refuse to be buried…\n\nPRODUCTION FACTS:\n\nHOW LONG WAS THE FILM SHOOT? 29 DAYS\n\nWHERE DID YOU SHOOT THE FILM? LOS ANGELES, SANTA CLARITA, SIMI VALLEY\n\nHOW LONG WAS THE FILM IN POST PRODUCTION: 28 MONTHS, 20 EDITING, 6 POST & 3 CAMPAIGN\n\nTHE '78 WAS SHOT WITH NO LIGHTS, WAS DEJA VU? YES-NO OUTSIDE LIGHT, ALL NATURAL LIGHT WAS USED.\n\nHOW MUCH OF THE FILM WAS SHOT OUTSIDE? 27 DAYS\n\nDID THE WEATHER INTERFERE WITH THE SHOOT DAYS? NO, BUT THE HEAT WAS 100 DEGREES ON AND OFF DURING OUR TWO MONTH SHOOT, SOME DAYS WERE BRUTAL, ESPECIALLY THE CEMETERY SCENES.\n\nDEJA VU MEANS? YOU’LL HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE.\n\nDO I NEED TO SEE THE 78’ TO UNDERSTAND THE NEW FILM? NO, BUT THERE ARE SOME EASTER EGGS FOR THE SPIT FANATICS.\n\n7 OUT OF THE 9 ACTORS HAVE A COMBINED TOTAL OF CREDITS? 400-500 CREDITS. FIVE OF THE ACTORS ARE CLASSICALLY OR THEATRICAL TRAINED; HOLGIE FORRESTER, ROY ALLEN, MARIA OLSEN, JIM TAVARE, JEREMY FERDMAN. NOT TYPICAL FOR A HORROR GENRE FILM.\n\nTHE HISTORY BEHIND ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HORROR TITLES EVER MADE.\n\nThis original 1978 film highly influenced and changed the way filmmakers make movies.\n\nOne of the most iconic posters in movie history.\n\nIt created a genre like no other...a female taking on her own dose of revenge.\n\nThe original film SET THE BAR for ALL revenge films.\n\nThe film is still referenced and debated worldwide by cinephiles some 40 years after it was made.\n\nThe original I Spit On Your Grave changed the face of cinema with its stark depiction of brutality and documentary shooting style.\n\nI Spit On Your Grave became 1981's top-selling video release in the US & Canada, ahead of Grease and even The Godfather: Part II and to this day continues to be one of the most in demand titles in DVD & Blu-ray and on the Internet.\n\nEight editions by eight different distributors were issued in the past 38 years and it will be released for the 40th Year Anniversary in 2019.\n\nThe Blu-ray edition is one of the most coveted films to own for a collector.\n\nIt’s consistently one of the best-selling video titles at Walmart, Target and Amazon, along with its three offshoots that were made since 2010.\n\nThe motion picture was licensed and re-licensed repeatedly to numerous countries throughout the world for theatrical, home video and TV. Upon the release of the video of I Spit On Your Grave in the United States, it climbed instantly to the top best-selling retail and wholesale charts and stayed there for months along with Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world.\n\nThe new sequel, I Spit On Your Grave Deja Vu is one of most anticipated fan based sequels in the horror world.\n\nClick images to enlarge.\n\nThis page includes affiliate links where Horror DNA may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.\n\nWant to share some news?
