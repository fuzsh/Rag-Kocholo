        "text": "It's been a while, so I'm overdue for another odds 'n' sods post, rounding up stuff I've written elsewhere in the great beyond we call the internet. Some of these go back several months, into last year even, and others are more recent, but all of them are about one of my favorite topics: cult classic films. And for me there's no doubt the films discussed in these articles and reviews are absolute cult movie solid gold.\n\nAt times Nurse 3D plays a b-movie Single White Female on acid.\n\nFrom wisecracking, half-naked interstellar space babes to erotically charged nurses behaving badly, from several different women on brutally single-minded revenge missions to one of the great movie urban legends of all time, these pieces run the exploitation gamut.\n\nIf memory serves, the great Rhonda Shear hosted a few of these movies on USA Up All Night.\n\nFor lovers of all things cult cinema—my fellow disciples of Rhonda Shear and USA Up All Night and all you fellow members of Joe Bob Briggs's Drive-In movie mutant family—these are for you. Enjoy.\n\n*****\n\nThe Legend of Demi Moore's Backside, Or, I Stripteased on Your Grave\n\n(The After Movie Diner)\n\nA reminder for you younguns, Demi Moore was, is, and shall forever be a stone-cold fox.\n\nIs that really Demi Moore's backside on the infamous poster for 1978's I Spit on Your Grave? This rumor has swirled around since I was a kid and I've spent far too much time thinking about it (and doing, um, research on it), so it more than deserved its own article.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nWell, as young people do, we began obsessing over this rumor, which really meant we were obsessing over Moore's rump. It seemed clear that the woman on the cover was not the film's star, Camille Keaton, and the model's body certainly bears more than a little resemblance to Moore's own. We proceeded to do endless amounts of research. It was a hard job but somebody had to do it. Pouring over shots of Moore's derrière with the sort of intense determination we'd never applied to our actual school studies, many of us came to the conclusion that, yes, it had to be true. Maybe we wanted it to be a true a little too much. Can you blame us?\n\nNurse 3D\n\n(The After Movie Diner)\n\nKatrina Bowden might seem like just another pretty face but she's quite compelling as the lead in Nurse 3D.\n\nI found Nurse 3D, from 2013, to be a rollicking good time. Had it been released in the 1970s, it would've found a wider audience on the drive-in circuit. It's an absolutely ludicrous film, which is exactly what a B-movie should be.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nYou see, when Abby isn't strutting through the halls of the fictional All Saints Hospital in New York City, while wearing sky-high heels and the tightest, lowest-cut nursing outfit you've ever seen, she's a serial killer on a mission of retribution: she kills men who cheat on their women, often in creatively sadistic ways. Soon after witnessing one of her brutal kills, we meet the new nurse Abby will be mentoring, the naive blonde bombshell Danni Rogers (Katrina Bowden), who needs all the help she can get. If the daily trauma of working in the ER doesn't get her, there's the hilariously over the top naughty nurse Halloween costumes she and all of the nurses (including wisecracking Niecy Nash) are required to squeeze into - garter belts and thigh highs are required, ladies! All Saints is absurd because it's basically what a thirteen year old who's been weened on Skinemax thinks hospitals look like. Then there's pervy Dr. Morris (a scenery chewing Judd Nelson). When he isn't berating Danni in front of hospital staff, he's slapping her ass or grinding from behind—all right out in the open, during working hours! All Saints is a human resources nightmare.\n\nSlave Girls from Beyond Infinity\n\n(The After Movie Diner)\n\nAn intergalactic Butch and Sundance.\n\nFor my money, this is one of the best b-movies ever made, and features one of my favorite cult film performances, from Elizabeth Kaitan as a hilariously sarcastic and totally badass Han Solo-type who just happens to be a half-naked woman. We're talking Cult Goddess level performance by Kaitan.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nSlave Girls from Beyond Infinity is basically an intergalactic homage to The Most Dangerous Game, starring two blonde, scantily clad, space-traveling heroines who must fight for their lives while hunted for sport. Of course, the movie does open with another random blonde (below) running for her life before stopping to pose in front of the camera for a gratuitous cleavage shot. I suppose that's when Helms's shocked constituent blew a gasket. If you know what I mean, and I think you do.\n\nA Look Back at Naked Vengeance\n\n(Diabolique)\n\nI miss when movie posters were this beautiful and evocative.\n\nThis is a tough watch, as are most rape-revenge films, of course. But this one is particularly brutal and affecting.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nSpecial commendations go to Deborah Tranelli, who does everything asked of her, and more, in an astonishing performance (she even sings the theme song, too). She’s extraordinary, and proves that great acting most certainly does occur in low-budget exploitation fare. As unsubtle and difficult to endure as it may be, Naked Vengeance is one of the most memorable films of its kind.\n\n\"She Gives Good Kung Fu\": Lady Street Fighter\n\n(Diabolique)\n\nNo celery stalks were harmed during the making of this film, and were in fact treated quite well.\n\nAnother all-time epic performance from a Cult Goddess, Lady Street Fighter is positively bizarre yet still manages to reach greatness thanks to the astonishingly strange, sexy, silly, and damn-near supernatural performance from its star, Renee Harmon.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nLady Street Fighter is a cult classic for several reasons, but the one that matters most is the jaw-dropping lead performance by the triple-threat star, writer (uncredited), and producer, Renee Harmon. She is our lady street fighter, Linda Allen, and everything revolves around and hinges on her performance, and what a perplexing performance it is. I’m still wrapping my head around it. Let’s start with the fact that the buxom, German-born brunette spitfire has an accent so thick that it’s only possible to understand one out of every five words she utters. Yet, it’s not what she’s saying, but how she is saying it that matters. Everything is spit out with a intoxicating combination of bemusement, contempt, and pure unadulterated sexually charged bro. Harmon has panache, in spades.\n\n*****\n\nEnjoy the articles, while I shuffle off to enthuse about even more cult classics. After all, these reviews won't write themselves!\n\nLabels\n\nThis month marks sixty-five years since one of the most iconic moments in twentieth-century popular culture: Marilyn Monroe’s angelic white dress being blown sky high by wind rushing up from a subway grate beneath her feet in the film The Seven Year Itch . Billy Wilder shot multiple takes, while Sam Shaw snapped photo after photo for what had to be the biggest publicity stunt ever staged at the time. Marilyn wore two pairs of underwear for the shot, yet, as noted in Lois Banner's critical biography Marilyn: The Passion and the Paradox (2012), \"a dark blotch of pubic hair\" remained visible to the 100 male photographers and over 1,500 male spectators, all of whom crowded eagerly around the set to gawk and drool. Due to strict 1950s movie censorship laws, photos had to be doctored to white out the offending blotch, but those in attendance saw it, over and over, shot after shot. Marilyn's husband at the time, the extremely old fashioned Joe DiMaggio, stormed off th\n\nJoe Dante's 1980s classic Gremlins will always be a subversive Christmas favorite. From Spike exploding in the microwave to Mrs. Daigle's \"stairlift to hell\", the movie is packed with deliciously transgressive moments that turn the holly jolly season right on its ear. None are more memorable, though, than Phoebe Cates delivering her legendary \"worst thing that ever happened to me on Christmas\" monologue. It's a jaw-dropping, tour-de-force moment, a truly horrific story that's also one of the most darkly comic moments in Christmas movie history. Cates really shines during this scene. There's no denying just how seminal that scene of hers in Fast Times at Ridgemont High was for a generation of young people, but her speech in Gremlins is equally important and a wonderful showcase for her serious and comedic acting skills. Here's the speech, in its entirety. No Christmas season is complete without at least one viewing\n\nLooking back at the pop culture mainstays of this Gen-Xer's gloriously misspent youth. One of the most famous and oft-quoted Seinfeld scenes involves Bobka and Jerry's discovery of the existence of Cinnamon Bobka. After Elaine scoffs at the notion of such a thing, even calling it a \"lesser Bobka,\" Jerry unleashes one of the great defenses of a freshly ground spice ever delivered: People love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, \"Oh This is so good. What's in it?\" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Joanne Whalley is like Cinnamon. Yes, I just compulsively double-checked my DVD copy and it's the unrated version, thank you very much. Let me explain. You see, during the formative years of my misspent youth, if I stumbled on a movie featuring the doe-eyed, petite, beautiful English actress, invariably I'd feel like Jerry does about Cin\n\nThis series looks back at the 1990s and its influence on the generation of people who came of age during the decade. Very few television series in the 1990s were as polarizing as Married...with Children . People either loved it or they loathed it. TV critics and good upstanding Catholic families like mine fell into the latter category. Soon after it debuted during my first year of junior high in 1987 (not quite the '90s, but on the brink), my parents made it clear that we would not be watching. I believe the words they used were \"vulgar,\" \"unfunny,\" and, one of their perennial favorites, \"risque.\" Of course, this meant it immediately took on a prurient appeal for me. Parents can never win, honestly. Kelly Bundy—the talented Christina Applegate, who never gets enough credit for elevating the blonde airhead trope into an art form—only further piqued my interest. She was like the girls in school with the absurdly voluminous hair and ridiculously sh\n\nLinda, that girl looks just like Pat Benatar. I know. Wait, there are three girls here at Ridgemont who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look. I was just a kid when Fast Times at Ridgemont High opened in 1982. Still though, even at the tender young age of seven, I knew who Pat Benatar was, because a.) her music was all over the radio and even then I recognized the utter awesomeness of her vocal talent in songs like \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\", and b.) some of the older girls around town were obviously cribbing their looks—clothes, hair, makeup, strut—from Benatar's own style. Benatar was ubiquitous. So, when I see or hear vintage-era Benatar now, I think of Fast Times , but mostly I remember that ubiquity—of both the performer and her legion of young imitators. I know it's not true, but when I recollect those years I swear every older girl looked like either Benatar, Juice Newton, or Joan Jett. It's easy to forget, years later, that\n\nLooking back at the pop culture mainstays of this Gen-Xer's gloriously misspent youth. ***** A note on the series and this site: This might be the final post in the \"Misspent Youth\" series - at least here. Maybe it'll eventually move with me. Oh, right, I buried the lede: I've moved, and would love for you to come visit me at my new site, The Starfire Lounge ! Moving forward, this site will likely cease to be updated, but will remain around for posterity and your continued reading pleasure. I have a few more things to post here over the coming days or weeks as a sort of \"everything must go\" send-off to the old girl. I also plan to write a final farewell post to my main online home for the last five years. Stay tuned and, as always, thanks for reading. ***** It's no surprise that the talented but now mostly forgotten Randi Brooks would make an appearance in the Misspent Youth series. She may not be a household name, but her resume\n\nLooking back at the movies, music, television, and other pop culture mainstays of this Gen-Xer's gloriously misspent youth. Once I decided that Morgan Fairchild would be the subject of the next installment in this series, I did what I usually do and researched online for a bit, just to refresh my memory on details that might've previously been lost to time. Morgan Fairchild was legitimately one of the most potent sex symbols of the 1970s and '80s. Not that I needed much refresher when it came to Fairchild. Born Patsy Ann McClenny in Dallas, Texas, February 3, 1950, the American actress was everywhere during those oh-so-crucial formative years of my pop culture obsession. She loomed large in the growing ranks of proto-haughty glamour queens, a trope that was hot on prime time TV in the 1980s. The characters she was most well-known for were drop-dead gorgeous and didn't suffer fools lightly. Really, few ever did it better than Fairchild. The shirt do\n\nThis series looks back at the 1990s and its influence on the generation of people who came of age during the decade. For six seasons in the 1990s, The Nanny made many of us laugh. At times, it could be downright hilarious . At others, well, not so much . This isn't a review of a '90s sitcom staple, though. No. This is simply an excuse to come clean about something I've kept buried deep inside for over two decades now: I had a secret crush on The Nanny herself, Fran Drescher. The unadulterated nineties-ness of this is practically blinding. And I love it. While The Nanny was sometimes quite funny, thanks largely to Drescher's spunky charisma and wholehearted commitment, the show was never considered hip. People my parents age seemed to love it, but my friends preferred, well, Friends . That smile! Those legs! That dress! It's all overloading my circuits. I watched Friends with my friends, but I also thoroughly enjoyed The Nanny , to\n\n\"I dream about sex, flying, and being chased by Nazis.\" — Margot Kidder, Rolling Stone , \"The Education of Margot Kidder\", 1981 ***** File that quote under, \"Reasons why I love Margot Kidder.\" Last month, Margot hopped a one-way flight with old pal Chris Reeve off into the stars and beyond, where they could reenact their iconic moment from Superman (1978), for all eternity. I wrote a little about Margot, here and here , trying to explain why this particular actress meant so much to me as a kid growing up in the 1980s. I thought that would be enough. It wasn't.* Those posts were my fumbling attempts to sort out just how large an impact Margot had on my young life, and, to my present-day surprise, how much she still means to me now. Before news of her death, I hadn't thought of her in ages. I assumed the early childhood crush I harbored for my Lois Lane had dwindled and faded. Ha! I was a fool. My crush on Margot was very\n\nRevisiting and celebrating the work of Michelle Pfeiffer, the best actress of my lifetime. Spoiler alert: I'll be discussing plot points for the new film Ant-Man and the Wasp . ***** If you've spent any time at all on the internet this week, chances are you've noticed the gushing adulation and hyperbolic lovefest surrounding Michelle Pfeiffer's performance in the newly released, and extremely fun, Ant-Man and the Wasp . It's fascinating to behold this lovefest—and also to be an active participant in it! Obviously, I spent some time on Twitter praising Pfeiffer's work as Janet van Dyne, the original Wasp, after seeing the movie. And of course I'll be heaping more praise on her work here. Yet, what's so intriguing about it all is that she only appears in the film briefly! It's a glorified cameo. She has, max, fifteen minutes of screen time (an awfully generous estimate on my part), but she is the highlight of the film, no questio"
