        "text": "I’ve been debating on whether or not to do a proper review of the 1978 classic I Spit on your Grave. What else can one possibly add to the discussion that hasn’t been said before? Love it or hate it, it’s still one of the first Grindhouse pictures I had ever seen at a young age which certainly cemented my obsession with the genre. The film has been in and out of print on Blu-ray over the years, but this Ronin Flix 4K Ultra Edition certainly sits at the top of the hill.\n\nThe movie follows Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton), a writer who has rented an isolated cabin out in the woods. Trying to mind her own business, she runs afoul of a group of backwood hillbillies who brutally beat and rape her, leaving her for dead. While trying to make sense of the trauma she’s been through, she takes the law into her own hands. Jennifer hunts them down one by one, exacting her own brand of vengeance.\n\nRonin Flix had previously released the film last year in a Collector’s Edition with the 2019 sequel I Spit on Your Grave: Déjà Vu. That film re-teamed the pair of star Camille Keaton with the original film’s writer-director, Meir Zarchi. The only thing missing from this 4K release was the inclusion of the sequel. It’s undoubtedly missed but not by any means a necessity. The film looks and sounds better than it ever has, or maybe should. The film certainly shows its age, but the restoration is relatively flawless. If you have a solid 4K setup, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nThe special features from previous releases have been ported over to this 3-disc set. The first disc contains the 4K presentation of the film and the theatrical trailer, a commentary from Zarchi, and a really entertaining and informative second commentary from late-night movie host Joe Bob Briggs.\n\nRELATED: 8 Horror Films to Still Look Forward to in 2022\n\nThe second disc is the standard Blu-ray with the previously mentioned special features along with interviews, TV Spots, Radio Spots, and a few other bonuses, including a featurette on the filming locations. The third disc features the documentary feature Growing Up with I Spit on Your Grave (2019), which was directed by Meir’s son Terry Zarchi. It deep-dives into the legend of the film and sheds light on the entire phenomenon. You’re also treated to Terry Zarchi’s 8mm short film with Keaton, home movies, and more.\n\nThe packaging is pretty typical with a standard slipcase, with none of the previous release’s bells and whistles but certainly not a disappointment. If you’re a fan of the film or the genre, this release is definitely recommended regardless if you own previous copies or not. You may even learn something about it if you’re not an aficionado. For example, I had no clue that the woman in the iconic poster for the film, photographed from behind in torn clothing holding a knife, was Demi Moore."
