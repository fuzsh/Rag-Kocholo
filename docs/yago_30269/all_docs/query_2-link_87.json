        "text": "Irish film censors have banned the re-release of a controversial 1978 horror movie.\n\nThe Irish Film Classification Office (IFCO) has blocked the sale of the DVD I Spit on Your Grave, starring Buster Keaton's granddaughter Camille Keaton.\n\nThe film was prohibited on 14 September for depicting acts of gross violence and cruelty towards humans.\n\nDirector Meir Zarchi said he was not surprised Ireland banned the film.\n\nIt tells the story of an aspiring writer who is repeatedly gang-raped and left for dead by four men whom she systematically hunts down for revenge.\n\n\"It has relentlessly continued to shock and offend audiences since 1978 when it was first released, and it still does to this date,\" he said.\n\n\"However, with the level of graphic violence and horror available these days, it is surprising that IFCO sees this 1978 film as more offensive than some of the most daring and empty of content torture porn available today.\"\n\nThe IFCO last made a prohibition order in 2007 when watchdogs banned the video game, \"Manhunt 2\".\n\n\"I Spit On Your Grave\" was regarded as one of the most graphic and violent films in cinema history. The cult film, originally released under the name \"Day of the Woman\" is still available in the UK.\n\nBut Irish fans of the \"video nasty\" will be prohibited from purchasing locally, forcing them to import UK versions from internet retailers.\n\nThe movie has also been remade and will be in cinemas across the UK next February."
