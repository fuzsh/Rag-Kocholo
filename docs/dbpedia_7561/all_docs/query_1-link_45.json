EMEF facilitates that process and develops plans based on the monitoring and understanding of Euro-Mediterranean political/economic tendencies.\n\nEMEF´s main objectives are: rethinking political processes and economic transition on eastern and southern shores of the Mediterranean and Eastern Adriatic; recognising and defining national interests of Croatia related with Adriatic and Mediterranean potentials and issues; bottom-up approach to policy-making processes and participatory democracy that includes experts, scientists, think-tanks, SMEs and CSOs; civil participation in establishing a stimulating environment for new policies: political will, favourable legislation and precise procedures."
