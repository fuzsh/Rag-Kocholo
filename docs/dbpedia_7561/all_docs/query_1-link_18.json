        "text": "Preventing illegal migration will be the main topic of the leaders' summit of the Mediterranean EU member states in Malta, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said upon his arrival in Valletta, noting that illegal migration bring numerous European countries into serious political problems.\n\nPrime Minister Plenković is attending the EU MED 9 summit in Valletta.\n\nThe EU MED group consists of nine Mediterranean and southern member states of the European Union - Cyprus, France, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.\n\nUpon his arrival in Valletta, the Prime Minister held a bilateral meeting with his Maltese counterpart, Prime Minister Robert Abel, after which he emphasized that Croatian-Maltese relations are very good and that the two prime ministers cooperate well within the framework of the European Council.\n\nCroatia and Malta are connected precisely by Mediterranean cooperation, because both countries are oriented towards tourism, shipping and trade, and there are mutual investments and cooperation in science and culture.\n\nIn his statement to the media after the summit, PM Plenković reported that they discussed the issues of the southern neighborhood, migration, climate change, and economic cooperation with the countries of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nHe added that all member countries of the EU MED group agree to continue strengthening the partnership with the countries of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe Prime Minister believes that the problem of illegal migration should be solved at the source, the external Schengen border of the European Union should be strongly guarded, all norms of international law should be applied, European law should be respected, as well as national law, and a common answer should be found.\n\nHe reported that the second part of the summit would be dedicated to the preparation for the meeting of the European Political Community and the informal meeting of the European Council in Granada, where the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union will mostly be discussed.\n\nNews"
