They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in certain aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually.\n\nEach member country appoints to the European Commission a European commissioner. The commissioners do not represent their member state, but instead work collectively in the interests of all the member states within the EU.\n\nIn the 1950s, six core states founded the EU's predecessor European Communities (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany). The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. To accede, a state must fulfil the economic and political requirements known as the Copenhagen criteria, which require a candidate to have a democratic government and free-market economy together with the corresponding freedoms and institutions, and respect for the rule of law. Enlargement of the Union is also contingent upon the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EU law, known as the acquis communautaire.\n\nThe United Kingdom, which had acceded to the EU's predecessor in 1973, ceased to be an EU member state on 31 January 2020, in a political process known as Brexit. No other member state has withdrawn from the EU and none has been suspended, although some dependent territories or semi-autonomous areas have left.\n\nList\n\n[edit]\n\nCountry ISO Accession Population[3] Area\n\n(km2) Largest\n\ncity GDP\n\n(US$ M) GDP (PPP)\n\nper cap.[4][5] Currency Gini[6] HDI[7] MEPs Official\n\nlanguages Austria AT 1 January 1995 8,926,000 83,855 Vienna 447,718 55,406 euro 29.1 0.922 20 German Belgium BE March 25, 1957 Founder 11,566,041 30,528 Brussels 517,609 50,114 euro 33.0 0.931 22 Dutch\n\nFrench\n\nGerman Bulgaria BG 1 January 2007 6,916,548 110,994 Sofia 66,250 23,741 lev 29.2 0.816 17 Bulgarian Croatia HR 1 July 2013 4,036,355 56,594 Zagreb 80,180 42,531 euro 29 0.851 12 Croatian Cyprus[a] CY 1 May 2004 896,000 9,251 Nicosia 24,280 39,079 euro 31.2 0.887 6 Greek\n\nTurkish[b] Czechia CZ 1 May 2004 10,574,153 78,866 Prague 246,953 40,293 koruna 25.8 0.900 21 Czech[c] Denmark[d] DK 1 January 1973 5,833,883 43,075 Copenhagen 347,176 57,781 krone 24.7 0.940 15 Danish Estonia EE 1 May 2004 1,330,068 45,227 Tallinn 31,038 37,033 euro 36.0 0.892 7 Estonian Finland[e] FI 1 January 1995 5,527,493 338,424 Helsinki 269,654 49,334 euro 26.9 0.938 15 Finnish\n\nSwedish France[f] FR March 25, 1957 Founder 67,439,614 632,785[8] Paris 2,707,074 45,454 euro 32.7 0.901 81 French Germany DE March 25, 1957 Founder[g] 83,120,520 357,386 Berlin 3,863,344 53,571 euro 31.9 0.947 96 German Greece GR 1 January 1981 10,682,547 131,990 Athens 214,012 29,045 euro 34.3 0.888 21 Greek Hungary HU 1 May 2004 9,730,772 93,030 Budapest 170,407 32,434 forint 30.0 0.854 21 Hungarian Ireland IE 1 January 1973 5,006,324 70,273 Dublin 384,940 89,383 euro 34.3 0.955 14 English\n\nIrish Italy IT March 25, 1957 Founder 58,968,501 301,338 Rome 1,988,636 40,065 euro 36.0 0.892 76 Italian Latvia LV 1 May 2004 1,862,700 64,589 Riga 35,045 30,579 euro 35.7 0.866 9 Latvian Lithuania LT 1 May 2004 2,795,680 65,200 Vilnius 53,641 38,605 euro 35.8 0.882 11 Lithuanian Luxembourg LU March 25, 1957 Founder 633,347 2,586.4 Luxembourg 69,453 112,875 euro 30.8 0.916 6 Luxembourgish[h]\n\nFrench\n\nGerman Malta MT 1 May 2004 516,100 316 St. Paul's Bay 14,859 43,086 euro 25.8 0.895 6 Maltese\n\nEnglish Netherlands[i] NL March 25, 1957 Founder 17,614,840 41,543 Amsterdam 902,355 57,101 euro 30.9 0.944 31 Dutch Poland PL 1 May 2004 37,840,001 312,685 Warsaw 565,854 33,739 złoty 34.9 0.880 56 Polish Portugal[j] PT 1 January 1986 10,298,252[9] 92,212[10] Lisbon 236,408 33,131 euro 32.1[11] 0.864 21 Portuguese[k] Romania RO 1 January 2007 19,186,201 238,391 Bucharest 243,698 30,141 leu 31.5 0.828 33 Romanian Slovakia SK 1 May 2004 5,459,781 49,035 Bratislava 106,552 32,184 euro 25.8 0.860 15 Slovak Slovenia SI 1 May 2004 2,108,977 20,273 Ljubljana 54,154 38,506 euro 31.2 0.917 9 Slovene Spain[l] ES 1 January 1986 48,797,875 504,030 Madrid 1,647,114 52,012 euro 32.0 0.911 61 Spanish[m] Sweden SE 1 January 1995 10,370,000 449,964 Stockholm 528,929 52,477 krona 25.0 0.945 21 Swedish\n\nNotes\n\nFormer member states\n\n[edit]\n\nList of European Union member states Country ISO Accession Withdrawal Population[3] Area (km2) Largest city GDP\n\n(US$ M) GDP (PPP)\n\nper cap.[4][5] Currency Gini[6] HDI[7] Official\n\nlanguages United Kingdom GB 1 January 1973 31 January 2020 67,791,400 242,495 London 3,158,938 56,471 sterling 36.6 0.929 English\n\nOutermost regions\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a number of overseas member state territories which are legally part of the EU, but have certain exemptions based on their remoteness; see Overseas Countries and Territories Association. These \"outermost regions\" have partial application of EU law and in some cases are outside of Schengen or the EU VAT area—however they are legally within the EU.[13] They all use the euro as their currency.\n\nTerritory Member State Location Area\n\nkm2 Population Per capita GDP\n\n(EU=100) EU VAT area Schengen Area Azores Portugal Atlantic Ocean 2,333 237,900 66.7 Yes Yes Canary Islands Spain Atlantic Ocean 7,447 1,715,700 93.7 No Yes French Guiana France South America 84,000 161,100 50.5 No No Guadeloupe France Caribbean 1,710 425,700 50.5 No No Madeira Portugal Atlantic Ocean 795 244,800 94.9 Yes Yes Saint-Martin France Caribbean 52 25,000 61.9 No No Martinique France Caribbean 1,080 383,300 75.6 No No Mayotte[14] France Indian Ocean 374 212,645 No No Réunion France Indian Ocean 2,512 837,868 61.6 No No\n\nAbbreviations\n\n[edit]\n\nAbbreviations have been used as a shorthand way of grouping countries by their date of accession.\n\nEU15 includes the fifteen countries in the European Union from 1 January 1995 to 30 April 2004. The EU15 comprised Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.[15] Eurostat still uses this expression.\n\nEU19 includes the countries in the EU15 as well as the Central European member countries of the OECD: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovak Republic.[16]\n\nEU11 is used to refer to the Central, Southeastern Europe and Baltic European member states that joined in 2004, 2007 and 2013: in 2004 the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia; in 2007 Bulgaria, Romania; and in 2013 Croatia.[17][18]\n\nEU27 means all the member states. It was originally used in this sense from 2007 until Croatia's accession in 2013, and during the Brexit negotiations from 2017 until the United Kingdom's withdrawal on 31 January 2020 it came to mean all members except the UK.\n\nEU28 meant all the member states from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020.\n\nAdditionally, other abbreviations have been used to refer to countries which had limited access to the EU labour market.[19]\n\nA8 is eight of the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia.\n\nA2 is the countries that joined the EU in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nChanges in membership\n\n[edit]\n\nEnlargement\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the Copenhagen criteria, membership of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, free-market liberal democracy that respects the rule of law and human rights. Furthermore, it has to be willing to accept all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of acquis communautaire) and switching to the euro.[20] For a state to join the European Union, the prior approval of all current member states is required. In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).\n\nSuspension\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is no provision to expel a member state, but TEU Article 7 provides for the suspension of certain rights. Introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 7 outlines that if a member persistently breaches the EU's founding principles (liberty, democracy, human rights and so forth, outlined in TEU Article 2) then the European Council can vote to suspend any rights of membership, such as voting and representation. Identifying the breach requires unanimity (excluding the state concerned), but sanctions require only a qualified majority.[21]\n\nThe state in question would still be bound by the obligations treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The Treaty of Nice included a preventive mechanism whereby the council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above.[21] However, the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright.[22]\n\nWithdrawal\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the Lisbon Treaty there was no provision or procedure within any of the Treaties of the European Union for a member state to withdraw from the European Union or its predecessor organisations. The Lisbon Treaty changed this and included the first provision and procedure of a member state to leave the bloc. The procedure for a state to leave is outlined in TEU Article 50 which also makes clear that \"Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements\". Although it calls for a negotiated withdrawal between the seceding state and the rest of the EU, if no agreement is reached two years after the seceding state notifying of its intention to leave, it would cease to be subject to the treaties anyway (thus ensuring a right to unilateral withdrawal).[22] There is no formal limit to how much time a member state can take between adopting a policy of withdrawal, and actually triggering Article 50.[citation needed]\n\nIn a referendum in June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU. The UK government triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017.[23] After an extended period of negotiation and internal political debate the UK eventually withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020.[24][25]\n\nPrior to 2016, no member state had voted to withdraw. However, French Algeria, Greenland and Saint-Barthélemy did cease being part of the EU (or its predecessor) in 1962, 1985, and 2012, respectively, due to status changes. The situation of Greenland being outside the EU while still subject to an EU member state had been discussed as a template for the pro-EU regions of the UK remaining within the EU or its single market.[26]\n\nBeyond the formal withdrawal of a member state, there are a number of independence movements such as Catalonia or Flanders which could result in a similar situation to Greenland. Were a territory of a member state to secede but wish to remain in the EU, some scholars claim it would need to reapply to join as if it were a new country applying from scratch.[27] However, other studies claim internal enlargement is legally viable if, in case of a member state dissolution or secession, the resulting states are all considered successor states.[28] There is also a European Citizens' Initiative that aims at guaranteeing the continuity of rights and obligations of the European citizens belonging to a new state arising from the democratic secession of a European Union member state.[29]\n\nRepresentation\n\n[edit]\n\nEach state has representation in the institutions of the European Union. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the Council of the European Union and European Council. When decisions are not being taken by consensus, qualified majority voting (which requires majorities both of the number of states and of the population they represent, but a sufficient blocking minority can veto the proposal). The Presidency of the Council of the European Union rotates among each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU.[30][31]\n\nSimilarly, each state is assigned seats in Parliament according to their population (smaller countries receiving more seats per inhabitant than the larger ones). The members of the European Parliament have been elected by universal suffrage since 1979 (before that, they were seconded from national parliaments).[32][33]\n\nThe national governments appoint one member each to the European Commission, the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors. Prospective Commissioners must be confirmed both by the President of the Commission and by the European Parliament; prospective justices must be confirmed by the existing members. Historically, larger member states were granted an extra Commissioner. However, as the body grew, this right has been removed and each state is represented equally. The six largest states are also granted an Advocates General in the Court of Justice. Finally, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank includes the governors of the national central banks (who may or may not be government appointed) of each euro area country.[34]\n\nThe larger states traditionally carry more weight in negotiations, however smaller states can be effective impartial mediators and citizens of smaller states are often appointed to sensitive top posts to avoid competition between the larger states. This, together with the disproportionate representation of the smaller states in terms of votes and seats in parliament, gives the smaller EU states a greater power of influence than is normally attributed to a state of their size. However most negotiations are still dominated by the larger states. This has traditionally been largely through the \"Franco-German motor\" but Franco-German influence has diminished slightly following the influx of new members in 2004 (see G6).[35]\n\nSovereignty\n\n[edit]\n\nArticle 4\n\nIn accordance with Article 5, competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states.\n\nThe Union shall respect the equality of member states before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each member state.\n\nPursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation, the Union and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties. The member states shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. The member states shall facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives.\n\n– Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union\n\nWhile the member states are sovereign, the union partially follows a supranational system for those functions agreed by treaty to be shared. (\"Competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the member states\"). Previously limited to European Community matters, the practice, known as the 'community method', is currently used in many areas of policy. Combined sovereignty is delegated by each member to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions. This practice is often referred to as 'pooling of sovereignty'. Those institutions are then empowered to make laws and execute them at a European level.\n\nIf a state fails to comply with the law of the European Union, it may be fined or have funds withdrawn.\n\nIn contrast to some international organisations, the EU's style of integration as a union of states does not \"emphasise sovereignty or the separation of domestic and foreign affairs [and it] has become a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs, right down to beer and sausages.\".[36] However, on defence and foreign policy issues (and, pre-Lisbon Treaty, police and judicial matters) less sovereignty is transferred, with issues being dealt with by unanimity and co-operation. Very early on in the history of the EU, the unique state of its establishment and pooling of sovereignty was emphasised by the Court of Justice:[37]\n\nBy creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves...The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights.\n\nThe question of whether Union law is superior to State law is subject to some debate. The treaties do not give a judgement on the matter but court judgements have established EU's law superiority over national law and it is affirmed in a declaration attached to the Treaty of Lisbon (the proposed European Constitution would have fully enshrined this). The legal systems of some states also explicitly accept the Court of Justice's interpretation, such as France and Italy, however in Poland it does not override the state's constitution, which it does in Germany.[citation needed] The exact areas where the member states have given legislative competence to the Union are as follows. Every area not mentioned remains with member states.[39]\n\nCompetences\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: subsidiarity\n\nIn EU terminology, the term 'competence' means 'authority or responsibility to act'. The table below shows which aspects of governance are exclusively for collective action (through the commission) and which are shared to a greater or lesser extent. If an aspect is not listed in the table below, then it remains the exclusive competence of the member state. Perhaps the best known example is taxation, which remains a matter of state sovereignty.\n\nCompetences of the European Union in relation to those of its member states[40]\n\nConditional mutual support\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, some eurozone states were given a bailout from their fellow members via the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stability Mechanism (replaced by the European Stability Mechanism from 2013), but this came with conditions. As a result of the Greek government-debt crisis, Greece accepted a large austerity plan including privatisations and a sell off of state assets in exchange for their bailout. To ensure that Greece complied with the conditions set by the European troika (ECB, IMF, Commission), a 'large-scale technical assistance' from the European Commission and other member states was deployed to Greek government ministries. Some, including the President of the Euro Group Jean-Claude Juncker, stated that \"the sovereignty of Greece will be massively limited.\"[41][42][43] The situation of the bailed out countries (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) has been described as being a ward[44][45] or protectorate[43][46][47] of the EU with some such as the Netherlands calling for a formalisation of the situation.[48]\n\nMulti-speed integration\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: European integration § Multi-speed Europe\n\nEU integration is not always symmetrical, with some states proceeding with integration ahead of hold-outs. There are several different forms of closer integration both within and outside the EU's normal framework. One mechanism is enhanced cooperation where nine or more states can use EU structures to progress in a field that not all states are willing to partake in.[49] Some states have gained an opt-out in the founding treaties from participating in certain policy areas.[50][51]\n\nPolitical systems\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of European Union member states by political system.\n\nThe admission of a new state the Union is limited to liberal democracies and Freedom House ranks all EU states as being totally free electoral democracies.[52] All but 4 are ranked at the top 1.0 rating.[53] However, the exact political system of a state is not limited, with each state having its own system based on its historical evolution.\n\nMore than half of member states—16 out of 27—are parliamentary republics, while six states are constitutional monarchies, meaning they have a monarch although political powers are exercised by elected politicians. Most republics and all the monarchies operate a parliamentary system whereby the head of state (president or monarch) has a largely ceremonial role with reserve powers. That means most power is in the hands of what is called in most of those countries the prime minister, who is accountable to the national parliament. Of the remaining republics, four[clarification needed] operate a semi-presidential system, where competences are shared between the president and prime minister, while one republic operates a presidential system, where the president is head of both state and government.\n\nParliamentary structure in member states varies: there are 15 unicameral national parliaments and 12 bicameral parliaments. The prime minister and government are usually directly accountable to the directly elected lower house and require its support to stay in office—the exception being Cyprus with its presidential system. Upper houses are composed differently in different member states: it can be directly elected like the Polish senate; indirectly elected, for example, by regional legislatures like the Federal Council of Austria; or unelected, but representing certain interest groups like the National Council of Slovenia. All elections in member states use some form of proportional representation. The most common type of proportional representation is the party-list system.[citation needed]\n\nThere are also differences in the level of self-governance for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are unitary states; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 9 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full federations, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands are federacies, meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have systems of devolution where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the legal right to revoke it.[54]\n\nStates such as France have a number of overseas territories, retained from their former empires.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrencies of the European Union\n\nEconomy of the European Union\n\nEnlargement of the European Union (1973–2013)\n\nEuropean Economic Area (integration with the EFTA States)\n\nHistory of the European Union\n\nMicrostates and the European Union\n\nPotential enlargement of the European Union\n\nSpecial member state territories and the European Union\n\nUnited Kingdom membership of the European Union\n\nWithdrawal from the European Union\n\nMember states of NATO\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
