        "text": "The UfM was launched at the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean in 2008. Building on the Barcelona Process that began in 1995, its aim was to further strengthen relations between Europe and the Southern Mediterranean countries. The Barcelona Declaration set to achieve a political and security partnership, an economic and financial partnership and a social, cultural and human partnership. The setting up of the UfM in 2008 enhanced cooperation in the Mediterranean and gave it fresh impetus. In addition to the 27 EU Member States and the 10 Southern Mediterranean partners, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Monaco, Montenegro and Mauritania joined the cooperation.\n\nHeadquartered in Barcelona, the UfM works on concrete projects such as de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, maritime and land highways and solar energy projects, regional research programmes, joint civil protection programme for natural disasters, and business development for small and medium-sized enterprises."
