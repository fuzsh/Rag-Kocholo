        "text": "Over the past decade, Croatia has become one of Europe’s most popular tourist destinations. Nautically-minded travelers worldwide flock to this Mediterranean paradise to embrace its impossibly blue water, jagged seaside cliffs, and expansive network of over 1,000 islands. From boats to beaches, Croatia’s unmatched coastline offers something for everyone.\n\nAs early as 2025, Croatia and many other countries in the European Union will require non-EU citizens to register with ETIAS before visitation. ETIAS is an electronic visa-waiver program that automatically links to the applicants’ passports upon approval, creating a streamlined method of enhanced border security.\n\nAre you planning a trip to Croatia? Learn how ETIAS might affect your trip.\n\nWhat is the purpose behind ETIAS?\n\nWhile ETIAS will provide the EU with various benefits, its primary scope is to protect its member states further. Over the past several years, several EU member countries have experienced dwindling security conditions. In 2016, ETIAS was officially proposed to address four concerns:\n\nEach year, around 200 million people cross EU borders, which continues to rise.\n\nAs a result of several international crises, the number of refugees and people seeking asylum has risen sharply.\n\nTerrorist attacks have become disturbingly frequent, threatening the lives of citizens who call Europe home.\n\nTechnological advancements have made electronic pre-travel authorization a realistic and practical way of maintaining border security.\n\nETIAS aims to alleviate these issues, providing significant benefits to EU citizens, customs agents, and international travelers.\n\nWhat will ETIAS change?\n\nUntil ETIAS, non-EU travelers, including U.S. citizens, could travel visa-free throughout the Schengen Area. Countries currently in the Schengen Area include:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSuch travelers can continue to travel visa-free throughout this popular group of countries; however, pre-registration will now be required.\n\nBefore travel, non-EU travelers will pre-register their information with ETIAS. Upon authorization, ETIAS authorization will be linked to each applicant’s passport.\n\nHow will ETIAS improve security?\n\nDue to the massive number of people passing through European countries each year, customs agents are overwhelmed. Every day, customs agents are faced with hoards of unknown travelers who must be vetted and authorized for entry on the spot.\n\nWith ETIAS, these agents will know beforehand who they will be greeting. On top of that, customs agents can cross-reference the travelers’ approved ETIAS with their physical documents, creating an adequate verification system.\n\nWill ETIAS make traveling to the EU more difficult?\n\nWhile registration through ETIAS requires an extra step for non-EU travelers, ETIAS aims to make travel more efficient for all citizens. Due to the electronic database that ETIAS provides, travelers can move through customs much quicker than before.\n\nRegistering for ETIAS is also very easy. Most applicants will receive their decision within minutes of applying. Furthermore, ETIAS authorization remains valid for at least three years, eliminating the need to re-apply within that window.\n\nDo I need an ETIAS for visiting Croatia?\n\nCroatia is a member of the European Union, and joined the Schengen Area in 2023. Thus, you would require an ETIAS to visit Croatia. Also, if you are planning to visit Schengen Area countries during your trip, you would need an approved ETIAS.\n\nHow do I apply for an ETIAS for Croatia?\n\nYou can apply for an ETIAS through a straightforward online process. Applying for an ETIAS for Croatia, is the same as applying for any other participating ETIAS country. The only difference being on the application form, where you would provide the name of the country you are entering first, as well as the names of other countries you plan to visit. On the form you would be asked to provide personal details, passport information, and answer security questions related to your travel, criminal and potentially health history.\n\nIf I hold a passport from Croatia, will I need an ETIAS?\n\nNo, if you are a Croatian passport holder, you are an EU citizen and do not need an ETIAS to travel within the Schengen Zone.\n\nDo I need an ETIAS when transiting through Croatian Airports?\n\nNo, you will not require an ETIAS to transit through Croatian airports. However, if you leave a Croatian airport and are travelling visa-free within the EU, then you will need to obtain an approved ETIAS.\n\nDo I need an ETIAS when entering Croatia by land, air, and sea?\n\nYes, you will need an ETIAS to enter Croatia regardless of your mode of travel.\n\nIs applying for Croatia ETIAS different than other countries?\n\nThere is no specific ETIAS for Croatia. An ETIAS is applicable to the Schengen Zone as a whole, rather than individual countries within it.\n\nCan I use the Croatia ETIAS for visiting other countries?\n\nYes, an approved ETIAS allows you to travel to all Schengen Zone countries as well as non-Schengen countries participating in the ETIAS.\n\nHow long can I stay in Croatia with an ETIAS?\n\nETIAS permits a stay of up to 90 days within a 180-day period.\n\nCan I stay 90 days in Croatia then visit another Schengen country for another 90 days?\n\nTime spent in Croatia counts towards the 90/180 rule of the Schengen Zone since Croatia joined the Schengen Area in 2023. Therefore, you cannot stay in Croatia more than 90 days in any 180 day period.\n\nIn what cases will a Schengen Visa be required over ETIAS?\n\nETIAS is not a replacement for the Schengen Visa. Instead, it’s a visa-waiver program for travelers who do not require a Schengen Visa.\n\nSome travelers, though, must register for a Schengen Visa instead of a visa. Notable cases that will require a Schengen Visa over ETIAS include:\n\nTravelers who are citizens of any country not on the list of 60 approved countries\n\nTravelers who plan to stay within the Schengen Area for longer than three months within six months\n\nIf you are unsure whether ETIAS applies to you, find out with the ETIAS online assessment.\n\nWhy is Croatia a popular vacation destination?\n\nCroatia is an ideal destination for summer travel due to its warm, sunny weather and wealth of coastline. On top of that, Croatia has a vibrant culture that includes unique cuisine, historical sites, and natural wonders.\n\nCroatia’s Beaches\n\nWhile Croatia is a small country, it boasts nearly 4,000 miles of total coastline. This is made possible by its network of more than 1,000 islands. As a result, Croatia hosts some of the most sought-after beaches in all of Croatia. Some of the most popular options include:\n\nThe picturesque cape of Zlatni Rat.\n\nBanje Beach and its surrounding ancient town.\n\nPunta Rata’s soft sand and crystal clear water.\n\nThe pine-tree laden Sakarun Beach\n\nNugal Beach and its nearby waterfall hiking.\n\nWhile each of Croatia’s beaches holds a variety of unique features, what they all share is their Mediterranean water. Croatia is nestled alongside the Adriatic Sea, and each beach features exceptionally warm water. During the summer months, the water temperature can range from 72 to 86 °F.\n\nBoating\n\nWith its expansive coastline, it's not a surprise that Croatia is a Mecca for boat enthusiasts worldwide. Many sail for weeks at a time, navigating through Croatia’s network of islands.\n\nOne of the most popular routes is from Split to Dubrovnik. This week-long expedition will take its sailors on a tour of Croatia’s best islands and the incredible cities of Split and Dubrovnik.\n\nHowever, lengthy nautical adventures are not needed to enjoy Croatia’s sailing culture. Many opt to rent boats for just a few hours at a time. The Croatian coast beckons if the goal is to sail, fish, or just relax beneath the Mediterranean sun.\n\nGeographical Diversity\n\nIts wide array of natural features separates Croatia from the rest of Europe’s coastal countries. For a small country, Croatia offers plenty to explore for outdoor adventurers. This is due to its unique location between the Mediterranean Sea and Dinaric Alps.\n\nThe result is a rugged coastline, flat plains, and mountainous highlands. Visitors can enjoy not just world-class beaches but also hiking, white-water rafting, and rock climbing.\n\nBest time to visit Croatia\n\nBecause Croatia mainly attracts outdoor-minded tourists, summer is its busiest season. Between the months of June and September. During this time, visitors will be rewarded with sunny weather between 66°F and 86°F.\n\nThese conditions are perfect for boating and swimming in Croatia’s beautiful water. Additionally, the summer is when visitors can experience such cultural events as Nights of Diocletian, Festival of Flowers, Dubrovnik Summer Festival, and Zagreb Design Week.\n\nThose seeking lesser crowds may consider visiting in the shoulder months of fall and winter when both crowds and prices are lesser. While the weather will not be as ideal, conditions should still be inviting enough to enjoy Croatia’s beaches.\n\nWhat do you need to visit Croatia?\n\nIf you currently travel throughout Europe without a visa, there are no immediate requirements to enter Croatia. ETIAS will eventually change that, however. Upon its implementation in 2025, ETIAS will require all non-EU travelers to enter the Schengen Area, which will soon include Croatia. If Croatia is on your bucket list, plan by seeing how ETIAS applies to you.\n\nSources\n\nWho Needs ETIAS? | ETIAS\n\nDifferences between ETIAS and Schengen Visas | ETIAS\n\nETIAS Assessment | ETIAS\n\n15 Tips For An Amazing Sailing Vacation In Croatia | Forbes\n\nDinaric Alps | Britannica"
