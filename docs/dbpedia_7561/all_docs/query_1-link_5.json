It is a forum for discussing regional strategic issues, based on the principles of shared ownership, shared decision-making and shared responsibility between the two shores of the Mediterranean. Its main goal is to increase both North-South and South-South integration in the Mediterranean region, in order to support the countries' socioeconomic development and ensure stability in the region. The institution, through its course of actions, focuses on two main pillars: fostering human development and promoting sustainable development. To this end, it identifies and supports regional projects and initiatives of different sizes, to which it gives its label, following a consensual decision among the forty-three countries. These projects and initiatives focus on 6 sectors of activity, as mandated by the UfM Member States:\n\nBusiness Development\n\nHigher Education & Research\n\nSocial & Civil Affairs\n\nEnergy & Climate Action\n\nTransport & Urban Development\n\nWater & Environment\n\nLink: UFM\n\nOfficial Web-Site\n\nMembers, Observers and other participations"
