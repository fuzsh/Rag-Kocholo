The Union for Mediterranean is a regional initiative set up in Paris in 2008 During France's EU presidency. The summit was organised at the initiative of European Parliament President Martin Schulz, who also chairs the Union for the Mediterranean's parliamentary assembly. The participants adopted a declaration which says that parliaments of member-states were a guarantee of political and economic progress of the region, political dialogue, economic cooperation and free trade which are also the pillars of Euro-Mediterranean relations.
