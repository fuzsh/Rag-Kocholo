        "text": "LETTER\n\nCAN Arab World and CAN Europe sent a letter to energy ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean asking to ensure that all fossil fuels, including gas, are on the phaseout.\n\nTo: Energy Ministers of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,\n\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,\n\nIreland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Poland,\n\nPortugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt,\n\nLebanon, Palestine, Mauritania and Jordan\n\nDear Energy Ministers,\n\nCAN Europe is Europe’s leading NGO coalition fighting dangerous climate change\n\nin Europe, representing over 180 organisations in more than 30 European countries.\n\nCAN Arab World is a network of more than 120 organisations in 17 countries\n\ncoordinating the efforts of civil society in the Arab world to promote climate\n\nprotection and renewable energy, in addition to developing strategies to reduce\n\ncarbon emissions from facilities across the region. Both coalitions include many\n\nmembers in the Mediterranean region, including your countries. We have recently\n\nlearnt about the Draft Ministerial Declaration on Energy suggested for the Third\n\nMinisterial Conference on Energy of the Ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean\n\n(UfM) in charge of Energy to be adopted in its next meeting in Lisbon, on June 14th.\n\nWe welcome the efforts in moving forward the partnership, regional dialogue and\n\ncooperation between the different Mediterranean countries to advance towards just,\n\nclimate-neutral energy systems in the region. This is notably important for an area\n\nthat is particularly vulnerable to climate change and to different environmental\n\npressures that can severely affect the access to water and food. Reliance on sound\n\nand well accepted scientific information is key for understanding what is at stake. For\n\nthis reason we encourage the energy ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean\n\n(UfM) to include a mention to the MEDECC report (endorsed by UfM) in their\n\nresolution, to put climate change adaptation and mitigation at the core of the\n\nMediterranean energy policies.\n\nAs foreseen by IRENA (the International Renewable Energy Agency) and other\n\nstudies, the Mediterranean region has abundant potential for the massive\n\ndevelopment of solar energy and onshore wind; the Mediterranean Sea has as well\n\npotential for far greater deployment of offshore wind turbines and ocean renewable\n\ntechnologies. The release of this potential should ensure the opportunity for citizens\n\nand local communities to engage in the energy transition and go hand in hand with\n\nbiodiversity protection. This is particularly important in less resourced areas, populated\n\nby communities with less access to education and infrastructure. These communities\n\nneed to be included in the planning process from a very early stage, avoiding impositions\n\n-particularly when talking about big scale projects- and clearly prioritizing their population\n\nin terms of jobs, infraestructures and other economic and non economic benefits\n\n(education, projects…). Environmental integrity needs to be ensured when planning these\n\ndevelopments, paying attention to impact risk to local resources, particularly effects on\n\nwater availability for the construction and maintenance of these projects.\n\nWhile we welcome, with the above considerations, the mention of the increase of\n\nthese energy developments in the draft Resolution, we are deeply worried about the\n\nrole fossil fuels still play in the future energy plans, particularly fossil gas. The\n\nsuggested draft Ministerial Declaration on Energy oddly grants this fuel an\n\noutstanding role in the clean energy transition of energy production and consumption\n\nmodes. This is simply not in line not only with science or the Paris Agreement, but\n\nalso with the latest revealing forecasts made by the International Energy Agency\n\n(IEA) in its recently launched benchmark report “Net zero to 2050” urging for\n\nimmediate and permanent cancellation of all new fossil fuel investments worldwide,\n\nwhether in exploration or infrastructure. This clearly means new gas developments,\n\nand particularly mega-projects like the proposed East Med pipeline will be totally\n\nunnecessary and if built, become stranded assets with unacceptable environmental,\n\nsocial and economic damages, while hindering the sustainable energy transition at\n\nregional and global level.\n\nThese updated IEA findings must necessarily be reflected in the region’s energy\n\nscenarios. For the above stated reasons we urge the Energy ministers to delete from\n\nthe declaration those sentences recognizing “the major role of Southern and Eastern\n\nMediterranean countries as (…) as stable suppliers of natural gas, including LNG;\n\nThe role that natural gas plays in the clean energy transition of energy production\n\nand consumption modes (…)” or “the transitory role of lower-emission fossil fuels\n\nsuch as LNG and CNG, in particular when blended with biomethane or e-gas and\n\nprovided methane emissions are minimised”.\n\nFossil gas cannot anymore be part of the long-term energy scenarios. The Med\n\nregion needs to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and incorporate a “Just\n\nTransition” concept to support countries, regions and local communities through –\n\ninter alia – financial support to deploy renewable technologies, capacity building and\n\ntechnical know-how sharing.\n\nLastly, we would like to show our deep concern about the prominent role granted in\n\nthe draft declaration to organisations like the “Observatoire Méditerranéen de\n\nl’Energie” (OME) which includes only public and private Mediterrannean energy\n\nutilities, in particular all the oil and gas majors operating in the region. We raise our\n\nconcerns around the conflict of interest due to their influence on UfM Energy policies,\n\nstatements and scenario developments. Of particular concern is OME’s exclusive\n\nand thus dominant role in managing the UfM Gas Platform, contrary to the\n\narrangements for the other two UfM energy platforms, managed as far as we can\n\nascertain by the UfM secretariat.\n\nOME’s current control of the Gas Platform guarantees a strong tilt towards continued\n\nUfM-sponsored fossil fuel expansion in the Mediterranean, contrary to the IEA’s and\n\nMEDECC warnings already mentioned above. This intrusive role in what is supposed\n\nto be the secretariat of a multilateral, intergovernmental organisation, must be\n\nterminated without delay.\n\nWe are confident that you will take this urgent call into due account and approve a\n\njoint Declaration that is in line with science and the Paris Agreement objectives. We\n\nremain at your disposal to further exchange on ways to accelerate the just transition\n\nand climate neutrality in the Mediterranean region.\n\nYours sincerely,"
