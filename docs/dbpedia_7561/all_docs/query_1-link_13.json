        "text": "The initial form of inter-parliamentary cooperation was the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum, which was first convened in 1998. Delegates from the EP and the national parliaments of the EU Members and Southern Mediterranean partners attended this forum.\n\nThe European Parliament initiated the Forum’s conversion into a genuine Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) through a resolution. In 2002, the fifth Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers in Valencia approved this resolution. Following, the EMPA’s inaugural sitting was held in Greece in March 2004.\n\nAt the sixth plenary session, held in Amman in March 2010, EMPA’s name was changed to Parliamentary Assembly of the UfM (PA-UfM). This name emphasizes the PA-UfM’s unique role as the parliamentary body of the UfM, with a focus on democratic control and its consultative role."
