        "text": "Presentation by H. E. Gordan Jandroković,\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of the Republic of Croatia\n\nin the Illyrian Hall of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts\n\non the subject\n\nGlobal foreign policy challenges\n\nZagreb, 11 November 2008\n\nIntroduction\n\nDistinguished academicians,\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFirst of all, allow me to thank the academician, Mr Rudolf, for his invitation to speak before the members of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts and their guests on the subject of Croatian foreign policy challenges.\n\nIt is a great honour for me to speak on this theme in the Illyrian Hall, a place of important historical events for our people and our country.\n\nIt was here on 25 March 1848 that Josip Jelačić was appointed Croatian viceroy, and it is here that Croatian intellectuals presented The Demands of the People through which they advocated independence and the unification of all Croatian lands, the preservation of Croatian national identity, and the best possible positioning of Croatia in the 19th century. And it was here that the Academy of Sciences and Arts was founded in 1866.\n\nTherefore, this venue carries great symbolism, and my pleasure in being able to speak about the new challenges that our country and society are facing today is even greater since at the very beginning I can claim that the international position of Croatia has never been better, and its international prestige has never been higher than today.\n\nFour basic determinants of Croatian foreign policy\n\nWhat are the arguments supporting such a claim?\n\nThe arguments lie in the achievement of goals related to four basic determinants of Croatian foreign policy, and in the fact that the international community is acknowledging our efforts to achieve these goals.\n\nThe basic determinants of our foreign policy are to achieve membership of the European Union, membership of NATO, for Croatia to take the leading role in Southeast Europe, and an active role in the UN Security Council.\n\nThe successful achievement of the goals related to the four basic determinants forms the nucleus of our foreign policy.\n\nHowever, our foreign policy activities are also directed towards the development of relations with large countries – such as the USA, Russia, China, and India – and towards participation in the work of multilateral forums and initiatives dealing with the resolution of topical global issues.\n\nOur primary foreign policy goals are being successfully achieved, and this is acknowledged by the entire world.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nWe expect to become a full NATO member as early as the beginning of April next year at the ceremony in Strasburg and Kehl marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of NATO.\n\nThe ratification of the Protocol on Accession is running according to plan and has so far been successfully implemented in 8 NATO member states (Hungary, Lithuania, USA, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovakia).\n\nWe expect the ratification procedure to be completed by the remaining NATO members by February 2009.\n\nWe are also coming closer to full EU membership.\n\nThe most recent Progress Report on the Republic of Croatia has just been published by the European Commission, and it is the most positive one until now!\n\nThe framework time schedule for the completion of our accession negotiations with the EU by the end of 2009 has also been defined.\n\nWe intend to complete the accession negotiations within this timeframe, which means that in the period before us we will continue to implement a decisive reform policy, making changes within Croatian society, and at the same time changing ourselves.\n\nIn addition to its successful course towards EU and NATO integration, Croatia, thanks to its active political, economic and security engagement in Southeast Europe, has also been recognised as a flagship in the region.\n\nOur membership in the UN Security Council can also be viewed as a sign of our highly successful foreign policy activities so far.\n\nWe already have one year of experience in this UN body as a non-permanent member.\n\nThe issues which we deal with in the UN Security Council concern the resolution of current crises, and other security issues in the world.\n\nProof of this is that Croatia, from its position as an object of world policy has taken a great stride forward and put itself in the position of a country which co-decides on the most important issues of world policy.\n\nMembership of the UN Security Council, in addition to our participation in a number of UN peacekeeping missions (13 missions on four continents), NATO missions (Afghanistan) and those of the European Union (Kosovo and Chad) throughout the world have helped us gain a better perspective of global political circumstances and have shown the need to consider our foreign policy, not only in a European, but increasingly in a global framework.\n\nGlobalisation\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFrom gaining independence until today, Croatia’s foreign policy activities have focused on achieving international recognition, adjusting to European standards, and integrating in the society of western democracies.\n\nHowever, it is often forgotten that in parallel with the demanding process of political and economic transition, which was additionally troubled by the war and its consequences, Croatia has also had to deal with the phenomenon of globalisation.\n\nGlobalisation is a complex phenomenon which cannot be captured in a single definition. In more general terms, it can be described as a process of aligning and standardising socio-political life throughout the world, or of integrating the global community into a common economic, financial and social system as a direct consequence of accelerated technological development and the application of new forms of communication.\n\nThis phenomenon began to manifest itself more extensively at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, when it was perceived in some circles solely as a threat to the national state and national interests.\n\nThe perception of globalisation as a threat was primarily related to the uncertainty of adjusting to the new circumstances.\n\nToday, there is no state immune to the effects of globalisation.\n\nAnd each state, after an initial period of disorientation, has now attempted, in one way or another, to turn this phenomenon to its own advantage.\n\nTo begin with, this boiled down to the mere protection of national resources, values and vital state interests.\n\nHowever, after nearly two decades of globalisation, it has become clear that no state is capable of dealing with the challenges it is facing by acting individually.\n\nIt has become clear that only by participating in global initiatives and through international integration do we gain the necessary political, economic and military strength to overcome the challenges before us.\n\nAnd, what is equally important, it is only within these frameworks that we can maximise the benefits of globalisation.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nToday’s world has never seemed more connected.\n\nNever before have such great opportunities presented themselves to such a large number of people.\n\nHowever, in spite of this, this world is still immense, complex, and even dangerous.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, which marked the end of the Cold War, some were announcing “the end of history” – as in the title of Francis Fukuyama’s world bestseller.\n\nActually, the basic assumption was that western liberal democracy would impose itself as a government and social model and spread throughout the world.\n\nHowever, current circumstances in the world have proven that such optimistic forecasts were premature.\n\nInstead of coming to the “end of history”, we are confronted with tectonic shifts in the distribution of economic and political power and influence.\n\nOne of the consequences of these shifts is the surfacing of some almost forgotten conflicts – whose causes, in most cases, go way back in history.\n\nGeorgia is the most recent example. And the most well-known is certainly the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nAnd if it is true that in a globalised world distant regions no longer exist, then we cannot remain indifferent to the conflicts that smoulder or have already burst into flame – regardless of how near or far away they are.\n\nBecause each of these conflicts may have direct consequences on international, and thus on our own, security.\n\nThat is why it is important for a country like Croatia to make its contribution in Chad, in Afghanistan, or in the Western Sahara for the preservation of world peace and security.\n\nBesides the fact that in some way this is expected of Croatia, given its current foreign policy position, this is also in our own interest.\n\nThat is why, through the UN Security Council, through our participation in peacekeeping missions, and through our engagement in multilateral organisations and initiatives, we will continue to contribute to world peace and security.\n\nI repeat – this is in our own interest!\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nJust as the end of the Cold War marked the beginning of the new global era, so the terrorist attack on America (on 9/11, 2001) announced the beginning of changes in the security and military scene of the world.\n\nToday’s world is anything but a peaceful coexistence of different religious and cultural communities.\n\nWe are witness to numerous tensions and crises, and to the fact that the world simply does not yet have a response to some of these crises.\n\nTherefore, the prevention of confrontations of different ideologies, religions, nations and political systems is rightly considered one of the greatest challenges of our time.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nHowever, the modern world has been simultaneously facing a few additional major challenges.\n\nThese include security and military, economic and financial, energy and climate, demographic and migration challenges.\n\nSecurity and military challenges\n\nThe arms race and disarmament – concepts that we would otherwise relate to other times, when the world powers, following negotiations in Vienna and Reykjavik, signed the Final Act in Helsinki – unfortunately, even today, have not lost their importance.\n\nOn the contrary, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is still one of the most important topics of world politics.\n\nWe have witnessed since the end of the Cold War that the number of countries capable of manufacturing and using nuclear weapons has not decreased, but has rather increased.\n\nThere is growing interest in the development of nuclear technology precisely in those countries that are not parties to international treaties and conventions.\n\nAnd this increases the danger that the technology they possess can be used not just for civilian, but also for military purposes.\n\nAnd all this also makes way for the greatest evil of our time – terrorism.\n\nMoreover, the discussion on the prohibition of using cluster munitions and mines is still current.\n\nAnd in the last few months and even days we have been carefully following the news on the positioning of (American and Russian) anti-missile shields in Europe.\n\nAll this points to the need to strengthen the existing international mechanisms in order to avoid a new arms race.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nEconomic and financial challenges\n\nThe current economic and financial crisis can also be considered as a new paradigm in the world economy and in financial operations.\n\nThis is seen not only in the fact that the earthquake felt by the American stock exchange has today produced equal shocks on stock exchanges in Europe and Asia – which started discussion on the need to reform the global financial system, or to review the Bretton Woods model which has dominated the world capital market since the end of the Second World War – but also in the fact that an increasing number of new powers are seeking their place on the world stage.\n\nRussia has already convincingly and decisively returned to the world stage.\n\nAnd if China continues to grow as it has done so far, by 2050 its economy will be twice the size of the American economy.\n\nAnd there are also other countries on the threshold of industrial development, such as India and Brazil.\n\nPerhaps it would be interesting to mention that today 61 out of 500 of the largest companies in the world originated in one of the countries that are on the threshold of industrial development.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nEnergy security and climate changes\n\nIn this context, I would particularly like to focus on energy security and the supply of energy products, and on climate change.\n\nIn the last few months, these issues have attracted a great amount of attention.\n\nThe dependence of Europe and the countries that I have just mentioned on imported energy products from the Middle East and Russia has resulted in competition for the most favourable transport and strategic solutions, so that today various construction projects are competing to build oil and gas pipelines.\n\nThe largest number of potential oil and gas pipelines are to pass through Southeast Europe, including Croatia.\n\nCroatia, just like the rest of Europe, faces the same challenges, most of all the continuous growth in demand for energy, and dependence on imports of oil and gas.\n\nThe geographic position of Croatia, at the junction of the Danube region, the Adriatic and Southeast Europe, opens up great opportunities to develop cooperation with the European area, and to network in global, especially Southeast European, Mediterranean and Euro-Asian, energy flows.\n\nTherefore, our goal is to contribute to the overall strengthening of the EU energy policy through energy projects which are complementary to the European energy strategy.\n\nThis was the goal that directed us in drawing up the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nThe current discussion on reducing energy dependence has pushed an equally important issue – protecting against climate change – into the background.\n\nOnly two years ago, when the Stern Report was published, climate change dominated political discussion.\n\nThis report raised awareness that the preservation of the environment at risk requires a joint solution and that preventing the consequences of climate change is essential to prevent new threats to peace and security in the world.\n\nAnd when I say this, first of all I mean that even today in Africa, in the Middle East, in Central Asia or the South Caucasus – the consequences of climate change represent a potential source of new conflicts.\n\nFirstly, due to more difficult access to available resources (especially water) and the increasing difficulty in distributing these resources fairly.\n\nThis is why new models and measures are sought to ensure better environmental protection, without hindering sustainable economic development.\n\nThe measures for protecting against climate change, which are currently being intensively discussed, should keep global warming below 2 degrees.\n\nThe prerequisite for this is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (by 20% by 2020, or even by 30% if an agreement about this is reached at an international level) and to increase the share of renewable energy sources (to 20% of total energy consumption, and of bio fuel to 10%).\n\nAny agreement on complying with these measures will depend on the abilities of individual countries to meet the set goals on the one hand, and on preserving the competitiveness of their markets on the other hand.\n\nIn brief, these are foreign policy challenges that require a common approach and common answers and which – and I wish to particularly stress this – should in no way, because of the current crisis on the world financial market, be pushed into the background.\n\nI also point this out because these are issues that, although involving large costs and investment, also open up great opportunities for economic growth and development.\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the ILO, investments alone in the renewable energy sources sector in the next 20 or so years will grow to USD 630 billion, and this amount, according to some experts, will generate at least 20 million new jobs.\n\nAnd in the case of Croatia, the benefit from the Pan European oil pipeline has been estimated at an amount ranging from USD 1.3 to 2.2 billion.\n\nTherefore, we are dealing with areas that could contribute to a significant strengthening of Croatian and European competitiveness.\n\nOne of the challenges will certainly be to prevent – due to the strict regulations on limiting greenhouse emissions and the additional costs incurred by industry – the transfer of production capacities to countries with a lower level of environmental protection.\n\nIn this sense, it will be extremely important to adopt the ambitious goals of the European Union at a global level.\n\nAnd the outcome of negotiations on the post-Kyoto regime will be of key importance for this issue.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nDemographic trends and migrations\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nOn speaking about global challenges, I would like to turn to another important issue – the mutual connection between current demographic trends and migrations.\n\nI mentioned that some global phenomena – even though they constitute a great challenge – open up chances for growth and development, while others represent a serious threat to social and economic development.\n\nThe aging of the population and negative demographic trends present such a threat.\n\nThis threat affects the European Union and Croatia equally.\n\nThe share of the working-age population in the total population has been continuously decreasing, and today it is already clear that the fall in the birth rate and demographic aging will significantly change circumstances in the European, and thus also in the Croatian, labour market.\n\nMeasures such as adjusting structural, education system, and employment policies with a view to prolonging the working age of the population may temporarily alleviate, but cannot prevent in the long term all the consequences of such demographic trends.\n\nIt is assumed that even from 2035, the population of Europe will start to decline.\n\nThe situation is similar in Croatia, which has already been facing a trend of continuous population decline!\n\nFor these reasons, a growth of migration flows is expected both in the European Union and in Croatia.\n\nMultiple challenges arise from this: while on one hand there is a need for selective immigration so that the labour market can pursue economic growth and an increase in FDI, the second priority is to prevent a “brain drain” and illegal migration.\n\nThere is no doubt that, in addition to all the issues we have already mentioned, managing migrations and demographic trends will be essential in order to successfully deal with the consequences of globalisation.\n\nHowever, it is only if we add to this other challenges, such as the increasing prices of agricultural products, which make the fight against hunger even more difficult, the suppression of pandemics, such as AIDS, the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, or the very fact that the European Union, NATO and the UN are themselves going through a period of adjustment to the new global circumstances – that we obtain a total picture of the effects of globalisation that we are currently facing.\n\nThe challenges of Croatian foreign policy\n\nTaking all this into account, we can reasonably claim that managing the effects of globalisation will be the backbone of the political activity of Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Paris, London and Berlin – and, finally, also of Zagreb in the 21st century.\n\nThis means that today we already have to ask ourselves – what is moving the world we live in, and what will that world be like tomorrow?\n\nAnd what factors are going to affect its further development?\n\nThe dimensions and speed of the changes we are facing today are really sometimes not easy to follow.\n\nIt is even harder to understand them and to adequately respond to them.\n\nBut you will agree with me when I say that our response to the current circumstances in the world cannot, and must not, be isolation.\n\nToday, even a country such as Croatia is so extensively engaged in networking with its neighbours, Europe and the rest of the world that this is not, and cannot be, an option for us.\n\nOn the contrary, our goal must be to respond to the challenges of today with foresight and determination.\n\nAnd this means that we have to lead a responsible foreign policy which, after integration in Euro-Atlantic structures, will successfully introduce Croatia into the next stage – a stage in which we are going to act as an ally and partner to the member states of the EU and NATO, and where we are making an effort to find responses to the challenges of today and tomorrow – and all this through dialogue and cooperation.\n\nSo, to lead a responsible foreign policy means leading a policy which will take care of national interests, but also contribute to the common resolution of problems.\n\nIn doing so, it will be highly important not to respond to the current challenges by using old mindsets.\n\nOur way of thinking, working and deciding has to be continuously adjusted to new circumstances.\n\nThis is so because globalisation is also a question of the attitude, philosophy, and principles that we are going to use to resolve the problems and tasks before us.\n\nToday, it is clear that to deal with all the issues that I have just mentioned we require a new approach.\n\nFor Croatia, this means that, besides strengthening relations with the USA and other large states, after joining the EU and NATO it will also have to seek new partnerships and alliances within such integration to protect its national interests.\n\nAnd this will also imply the establishment of a new, more efficient decision-making structure within our state.\n\nAll this represents a great challenge for our foreign policy!\n\nHowever, although a great amount of work is in store for us to successfully deal with the changed circumstances in world politics, in some segments of its foreign policy activities Croatia has already made substantial progress.\n\nWithin a relatively short time, from being a country where peacekeeping missions were deployed, Croatia has become a country that participates in peacekeeping missions throughout the world, and, besides this, it has been continuously strengthening its multilateral activities – in the Council of Europe, in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and in the World Trade Organisation – just to mention a few.\n\nIn all these organisations Croatia is already contributing to the resolution of current global issues and crises.\n\nWe are already successfully applying our experience and expertise in dealing with the consequences of war and in redirecting the country on the path of peace, reconciliation and development, in all our multilateral activities.\n\nCroatia has also, from being a country that received international aid, become a country providing such aid.\n\nOn the basis of our experience with development assistance, we are making efforts to sensitise the international community to become more focused on people’s real needs.\n\nWe point out that greater efficiency can and must be achieved within the framework of current development assistance, but also that innovative sources of financing must also be considered.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nBesides finding effective and efficient responses to security challenges, the aim of our foreign policy must also be to create conditions which will allow the largest possible number of our citizens to exploit the:\n\n- advantages and opportunities of technological innovations;\n\n- communications revolution;\n\n- opportunities arising in new emerging markets.\n\nIn brief, these are the conditions for our country and society to make the best possible use of the advantages of global development.\n\nTherefore, foreign policy must directly work towards the internal development of our country and society.\n\nIn other words, in addition to securing peace, security and stability, foreign policy must provide opportunities for the sustainable and stable economic growth or our country, and thus directly contribute to raising the standard of living and enabling all our citizens to have a better quality of life.\n\nThis is why a significant part of our foreign policy activities already focus on the stronger promotion of the export capacities of our enterprises, and on providing individual support to our exporters and investors in broadening their operations and achieving their business interests in foreign markets.\n\nAnd, in some cases, this will also mean placing diplomatic representative bodies in locations where our business people show special interest.\n\nCroatia – the EU and NATO\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIn the conditions of globalisation, the best solution for a country the size and strength of the Republic of Croatia is precisely membership in the EU and NATO.\n\nMembership in the Euro-Atlantic community is not important just because, as is well known, Croatia has always – in terms of history, culture and values – belonged to the community of western democracies.\n\nEU and NATO membership is an issue of capital significance precisely because Croatia shares the same values on which these associations are based, which are: freedom, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights, equality, a free market economy…\n\nTherefore, we consider our commitment to EU and NATO membership as a logical follow-up to the political, economic and social development of our country so far.\n\nFor Croatia, joining the Euro-Atlantic community is also a matter of a clear commitment to a better life for its citizens.\n\nEconomic growth, peace, security and stability, access to EU funds, lower expenses for defence, mobility in the process of education, better business opportunities, growth of foreign investments, the balance of rights and obligations, and participation in the decision-making process – all these are the advantages of membership which will eventually lead to a better standard of living for our citizens.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nOn the path so far of our country’s integration into NATO and the EU, we have successfully overcome many hurdles, implemented a number of reforms and achieved a high degree of preparation for membership.\n\nNevertheless, at the end of the road – especially the road to EU membership – there are a few more challenges that we have to overcome.\n\nWe have been given a framework for the completion of negotiations in extremely difficult circumstances, of which let us mention only three: 1) enlargement fatigue; 2) the Lisbon Treaty; and 3) the financial crisis.\n\nAs you know, the problem of establishing a new institutional architecture for the EU is still current.\n\nThe European Union initiated a discussion on the new institutional order even before the last round of enlargement to ensure the unhindered accession of new Member States and to maintain, at the same time, the efficiency of its operation.\n\nThe need to find a suitable institutional solution did not arise just from enlargement, but also from the very development of European integration, which for years has been growing stronger and gaining a new dimension.\n\nThe desire was for the enlargement of the Union to be accompanied by its political “deepening”.\n\nActually, we can say that since then this issue has dominated all political discussions concerning the future of the EU – from the Convention on the Future of Europe through to the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nWith these new institutional solutions, the European Union also wished to adjust to the changes in the international relations of the 21st century, and to secure its efficient engagement on the “international stage”.\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty creates the conditions for all this.\n\nAs you know, the completion of its ratification remains a challenge – especially after the negative results of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland.\n\nWe are convinced that the European Union, as it has done many times before in its history, will find an adequate solution to emerge from the situation in which it found itself after the Irish referendum, and that this is not going to be an obstacle to our joining the EU.\n\nAlong with the news that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is continuing – (the Czech Republic intends to ratify it at the latest in the first quarter of 2009) – we also see a reason for optimism in that the referendum in Ireland was not an expression of reservations towards further EU enlargement, and thus not towards the integration of Croatia into the EU.\n\nOn the contrary, according to opinion polls in all 27 Member States, Croatia’s membership in the EU enjoys the support of the majority of European citizens.\n\nThe reason why we are devoting special attention to the unravelling of the situation of the Lisbon Treaty is less connected to the potential repercussions for our country’s membership of the EU, because there are clear indications that Croatia, in this sense, can be part of the solution.\n\nThis reason is to a larger extent derived from the fact that Croatia, in the framework of accession negotiations, will have to arrange for its participation in the work of European institutions (as part of Chapter 34 “Institutions”) and in the course of this, it will have to carve out its status, which will be proportionate to its objective strength and capacities.\n\nIt also arises from the fact that the Lisbon Treaty, among other things, provides for the establishment of a European External Action Service for which, as future member, we already have to start preparing.\n\nAnd, finally, our interest in the Lisbon Treaty also arises from the fact that it is not only important for Croatia, but also for other candidate countries and potential candidates for membership, i.e. the states involved in the Stabilisation and Association Process.\n\nWhen we speak of completing internal reforms, our goal in the forthcoming period is to implement even the most demanding reforms – such as restructuring the shipbuilding industry, fighting corruption and organised crime, and reforming the justice system and public administration.\n\nThese are strategic decisions and reforms and I admit that they are not easy.\n\nHowever, I wish to clearly stress that we would make these decisions in any case in our own interest.\n\nTherefore, it is not Brussels that is making us take these decisions, but it is our own choice, for the need to be involved in the global flows that I have just been talking about, for the creation of a favourable business and investment climate and for a society based on a knowledge economy.\n\nTherefore, EU membership is just an additional “wind in the sails” for the internal changes which we would have implemented anyway.\n\nHowever, it was precisely the last Intergovernmental Accession Conference that showed that, in order to successfully complete our negotiations within the foreseen timeframe, not everything depends on us, but also on the resolution of open issues with the Member States.\n\nHere I have in mind the unresolved border issues with Slovenia, which are not a matter of our accession negotiations, but nevertheless have an effect on the overall pace of our accession process.\n\nCroatia is prepared to resolve the open border issues with Slovenia in the spirit of good neighbourly relations and before an international judicial authority, as was initiated by the Bled Agreement between Prime Minister Sanader and Prime Minister Janša.\n\nAnd I will repeat once again here that Croatia’s documents in the negotiations are without prejudice to the sea border.\n\nIn fact, we have referred this issue to two commissions: a mixed Croatian-Slovenian Commission for Preparation of a Legal Framework for Filing the Dispute about the Demarcation of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia before an International Body, and a mixed Croatian-Slovenian Commission for Establishment of Areas of Dispute on the Border between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia, whose work we are supporting.\n\nAnd since the initial positions on the resolution of open border issues were presented at the first formal meetings of the Commissions, we believe that it will be possible to reach a final agreement with the new Slovenian Government on the question of which international judicial authority should be addressed for the resolution of this matter.\n\nI repeat – this is a bilateral issue that cannot be a reason for the freezing of accession negotiations.\n\nA chance to boost our relations with EU Member States and to create a more positive atmosphere which could prove an incentive in resolving these, and also many other, issues involving the Adriatic has been provided by our participation in the new EU strategy for the Mediterranean area, known as the Union for the Mediterranean.\n\nAs a member of the Union for the Mediterranean, Croatia is involved in seeking an answer to the challenges of the Mediterranean area through the realisation of important projects – such as the building of maritime routes, the protection of the sea environment, the more efficient use of renewable energy sources, or the strengthening of SMEs.\n\nBy being engaged in the Union for the Mediterranean, we have obtained the chance to profile ourselves as a Mediterranean country, to acquire new understandings and – as I have already stressed – to establish new partnerships for resolving issues of common interest.\n\nCroatia and Southeast Europe\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIn my presentation so far, I have spoken about all the challenges that lie before us and in what areas Croatia is already closely cooperating with the international community.\n\nHowever, in one segment of our foreign policy – the one that concerns our neighbourhood – Croatia has the role of flagship and model.\n\nHere, the international community has for a long number of years been closely cooperating with Croatia as a reliable and responsible partner.\n\nOur experience, knowledge and advice are of great benefit to our partners and allies, not only for further stabilisation, but also for the preservation of Euro-Atlantic prospects and the progress of the integration process in all countries of Southeast Europe.\n\nCroatia has made the most progress on the path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It provides an example to other countries in the region, showing that a reform policy pays off and that it is the best guarantor of progress on the path to integration.\n\nThe states of Southeast Europe constitute an area which is in a geographical sense surrounded by EU Member States.\n\nAny political instability in Southeast Europe therefore means instability for the entire continent.\n\nTo establish permanent peace and stability in these parts, it is of major importance to make the entire region part of the Euro-Atlantic community as soon as possible.\n\nTwo factors are especially important for this: maintaining the perspective of membership and strengthening cooperation with SEE at all levels.\n\nAnd this is why we transfer and share our experiences – as part of bilateral cooperation with the individual states of the region and as part of cooperation with the international community.\n\nOn the same basis, we are trying to find a solution for open bilateral issues.\n\nAlong with transferring experiences, Croatia, as I have said, also offers solutions to help its neighbours come to terms as soon as possible with the demanding path that lies before them towards integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.\n\nAn example of this is the significant contribution of Croatia in the development of the Southeast European Cooperation Process which took over the tasks of the Stability Pact for SEE.\n\nThe Regional Cooperation Council was established with a seat in Sarajevo, and a high-ranking Croatian diplomat was appointed its Secretary General.\n\nOur advocacy concerning the enlargement of CEFTA to all SEE countries (regardless of whether they had previously met the conditions for WTO membership) has also been of crucial importance.\n\nRecently, we also co-initiated the invitation to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro for membership in the American-Adriatic Charter\n\nWe are doing this because, despite the progress achieved in the region, we are conscious that Macedonia, due to the controversy with Greece concerning its name, has come to a standstill on its path to integration, that the recognition of an independent Kosovo is a new security challenge for Southeast Europe, while the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina also gives us cause for concern.\n\nFor this reason, in our contacts with the representatives of the international community, we have persistently stressed the need to redirect attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe have done this because it is evident from everything I have said that the interest today of the international community is to a large extent directed to other regions and parts of the world.\n\nIn these circumstances sometimes we lose sight that there are still unresolved issues precisely in our neighbourhoods which require the attention and assistance of the international community.\n\nWhen we speak about Bosnia and Herzegovina, no consensus has been reached among the representatives of the three constituent nations about the future of this country.\n\nThirteen years after the Dayton Agreement was signed it has become clear that although it brought an end to the war, in its present form it does not represent a sufficient basis for the further development and functioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nTherefore, we support all solutions that will be reached by an agreement of all three constituent nations.\n\nThe position of Croatia is clear and unambiguous: we support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we support the constitutive right and equality of all three nations, we support solutions that will ensure that the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina work efficiently, and solutions that will ensure the European future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nNaturally, we are devoting special attention to the protection of the rights of Croatians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, not only because this is our constitutional obligation, but also because it is a commitment derived from the Dayton Agreement.\n\nThe same is true of the protection of the rights of Croatians in other SEE countries.\n\nThe same attention which we give to the developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina we also devote to our relations with other states in the region.\n\nWe are aware that our relations with Serbia are particularly important for the stability of Southeast Europe.\n\nWe welcome and support the European commitment of the new Government and the fact that, by signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, Serbia has made the first important step towards its European future.\n\nWe wish to work with the new Government on the development of our relations and on deepening our dialogue concerning open issues.\n\nWe expect that the painful national trauma of losing Kosovo will not prevent the new Government of Serbia from taking a constructive position in its relations with Croatia.\n\nThis is why any distortion of historical facts and any accusations directed to Croatia are difficult for us to understand and are unacceptable.\n\nWe are looking towards the future, but we know very well who was the aggressor, and from where the war was initiated.\n\nIf it wants to go forward, Serbia must face the legacy of Milošević’s regime.\n\nThis is the only correct way and an important component of any reconciliation and the real basis for the development of good neighbourly relations.\n\nConcerning Kosovo, Croatia will continue to contribute to its stabilisation, and will support and assist its economic development and path towards EU integration.\n\nOur Embassy which we are just about to open there will present an important link between Zagreb and Priština.\n\nCroatia is also fostering good and friendly relations with other countries in Southeast Europe – Macedonia, Albania, and Montenegro.\n\nRelations with these countries are such that either there are no open issues at all, or that the ones that are still open are being resolved in a constructive manner.\n\nWe are also aware that for progress to be achieved by the entire region on its way towards integration, in addition to assistance in meeting the criteria for membership and strengthening regional cooperation, it is equally important to promote economic cooperation.\n\nIn this sense, Croatia is also striving to provide a maximum contribution.\n\nIt is doing this through the increasing presence of our business people in the region, and also by the fact that Croatia today is opening the doors to the markets of Southeast Europe to many international companies.\n\nIt is my conviction that the strengthening of economic cooperation may be of major help, not only for the further development and progress of the region on its way to integration, but also in overcoming the heavy burden of the past in these areas.\n\nThe European Union, which rose from the ruins left by World War II, is the best example of this.\n\nAnd since I mentioned the Second World War, I do not want to omit mentioning that precisely today, on 11 November at 11 a.m., the world is celebrating the end of the First World War.\n\nWe know that the beginning of both world wars is connected with the territories that surround us.\n\nAnd, therefore, we really hope that the year 2009 – besides being the year of the completion of our accession negotiations with the EU, and of Croatia becoming a fully fledged member of NATO – will also be the year of Southeast Europe, a year when the pace of SEE will accelerate on its course to EU membership, as the Commissioner for Enlargement, Olli Rehn, recently announced.\n\nThis is in our interest, because only the permanent stability and prosperity of the whole region can also guarantee the permanent stability and prosperity of the Republic of Croatia.\n\nAnd to conclude,\n\nCroatia has entered a very dynamic, important period where our primary foreign policy goals are as follows – the completion of accession negotiations, NATO membership, engagement in the Security Council, and the follow-up of many activities in regional and multilateral fields.\n\nBut also further adjustment to global challenges.\n\nAs much as these goals may seem challenging and demanding, Croatia has sufficient determination, strength and knowledge to achieve them.\n\nThank you for your attention!"
