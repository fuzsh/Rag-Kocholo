        "text": "Background and further information:\n\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the State of Israel, of the other part, entered into force on 1 June 2000.\n\nIn its Act of Accession, Croatia undertook to accede to the international agreements already signed or concluded by the European Union and its Member States by means of a protocol to those agreements.\n\nIn September 2012, the Council of the European Union authorised the opening of negotiations with the third countries concerned, in order to conclude the relevant protocols. The negotiations with Israel were successfully concluded in September 2017.\n\nIn April 2018 the European Commission presented proposals on the signing and conclusion of the Protocol. The signing was approved on 25 June by Council Decision (EU) 2019/102 and the signature took place on 20 December. The conclusion of the Protocol was approved on 8 April 2019 by Council Decision (EU) 2019/610."
