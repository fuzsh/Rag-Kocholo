        "text": "Italy-Croatia Joint Declaration\n\nJoint Declaration\n\nItaly and Croatia held the sixth meeting of the Coordination Committee of Ministers (COM) on 27 February 2024 in Zagreb. The Ministers reaffirm their commitment to further strengthen bilateral relations, as well as to enhance the partnership within EU, NATO and other multilateral fora. Croatia’s accession to the Eurozone and Schengen area, as well as the progress in the process of joining the OECD have opened additional avenues for closer cooperation. Italy reiterates its support to Croatia’s accession to the OECD and stands ready to cooperate further with Croatia in this regard.\n\nThe Ministers welcome the excellent meeting of Prime Ministers Giorgia Meloni and Andrej Plenković held in Zagreb on 16 November 2023 and the participation of Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani at the Dubrovnik Forum held in July 2023, as well as numerous bilateral contacts at political and working/expert level, in line with the commitments taken by the two sides in the Joint Declaration signed in Rome on 24 May 2022.\n\nIn accordance with all relevant legal frameworks, the two sides remain committed to promoting and protecting the rights of their respective minorities, whose historical presence and pro-active role have significantly contributed to fostering the bilateral cooperation and people-to-people contacts.\n\nThe Ministers welcome the imminent completion of the ratification procedure of the Agreement between the Italian Republic and the Republic of Croatia on the delimitation of the exclusive economic zones, which will enable its entry into force. The cooperation in the North Adriatic basin, both bilateral and trilateral with Slovenia, remains an important cornerstone in relations between the two countries, with particular focus on preservation of its environment and on enhancing better connectivity, security and closer cooperation in the blue economy sectors along the lines agreed during the Trilateral meeting in Ancona, July 2023.\n\nIn the time of global challenges, from security to climate change, Italy and Croatia are dedicated to continue building stronger, more resilient and globally competitive Europe, that is strategically autonomous. The two sides remain committed to the double transition, green and digital, and to further strengthening of our internal market. They stress the importance of progressively strengthening European defence and fully implementing the EU Strategic Compass. As EU embarks on a new institutional cycle this year, Italy and Croatia are committed to working, together with their European partners, on the new Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 that will prepare the Union for the future. They also reaffirm their commitment to continue working on all other issues of common interest on the European agenda, including within the MED 9 format. This format provides a valuable platform to address specific challenges related to Mediterranean region.\n\nThe Ministers furthermore highlight the value of regional cooperation and express support and commitment to relevant cooperation formats, such as the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region (EUSAIR) and the Adriatic-Ionian Initiative (AII), both of which Croatia is currently successfully chairing.\n\nItaly and Croatia continue to stand with Ukraine and its people in their fight against Russia’s war of aggression. They condemn Russia’s deliberate attacks and its intensified campaign of systematic air strikes killing civilians and destroying critical infrastructure, which constitute a serious violation of international law. They call on Russia to cease all combat operations and withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory without delay. Italy and Croatia reaffirm their unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. To this end, they will continue to provide Ukraine with financial, economic, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and other support, including support with de-mining. They stress the importance of the long-term EU military assistance to Ukraine via the European Peace Facility (EPF) and the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), as well as the EU’s financial assistance. They will continue to call for accountability and justice in relation to all crimes committed as part of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Italy and Croatia will continue their intensified diplomatic outreach efforts to ensure the widest possible international support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace within the key principles and objectives of Ukraine’s Peace Formula and the UN Charter. They welcome the decision of the European Council to open accession negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nItaly and Croatia express their concern about the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. They condemn the Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October 2023, stress the right of Israel to defend itself in line with the international law, and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The two sides are deeply worried about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the suffering of Gaza civilians, calling for more delivery of essential aid; more humanitarian corridors, including the maritime corridor; and a pause in hostilities. The Ministers stress the need to avoid the regional spill over of the conflict, and support efforts aimed at de-escalation, in cooperation with regional partners. They strongly condemn the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, which significantly hamper global trade flows, and demand their termination. They recognise the importance of international efforts in ensuring the safety of navigation and support an enhanced EU presence in the area to this end. Italy and Croatia support the revival of the political process based on a two-state solution as the only way to achieve the lasting regional peace.\n\nItaly and Croatia consider as a strategic goal keeping the region of Western Balkans at the top of the EU agenda and advancing decisively on the path of its European integration. A credible enlargement policy is a geostrategic investment in peace, stability, security and economic growth of the whole European continent. Furthermore, the two sides stress the importance of strengthening regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. The proposed Growth Plan for the Western Balkans provides important opportunities for fostering enlargement, supporting economic growth in the region and for accelerating its gradual integration in the EU single market. Italy and Croatia agree that EU engagement in the Western Balkans has to be ambitious and pro-active and that 2024 must be a year of concrete progress towards the European integration of the Western Balkans. Italy and Croatia will work towards the progress on the EU path of the Western Balkans countries in line with the merit based and individual approach in meeting the established criteria. Italy and Croatia underline the importance of opening of the EU accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 2024 and look forward to the report on progress that the European Commission will provide. They encourage Montenegro to accelerate EU-related reforms in order to further advance in its EU membership negotiations. Italy and Croatia fully support the opening of the first clusters of negotiating chapters with Albania and North Macedonia whose EU accession negotiations should proceed with sustained pace. Italy and Croatia welcome the visa liberalization with Kosovo. They fully support the EU-facilitated Dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo and call on both sides to negotiate with a constructive approach, in line with legitimate aspirations of their citizens to join the European Union.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the sixth meeting of the Coordination Committee of Ministers, the two sides agree to operationalise their bilateral cooperation as follows:\n\nAgriculture and Fisheries\n\ncontinue close cooperation within the „ADRIATICA“ Regional Group of General Directors of Sea Fishing as the ideal framework for collaboration and for the pursuit of the best – shared strategies, aimed at guaranteeing the long – term sustainability of fisheries from an environmental, economic and social point of view;\n\ncontinue applying management measures for shared fish stocks pursuant to the objectives set within both the European Union and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), by replicating the proven approaches and methods, which, particularly in the context of establishing the Fisheries Restricted Areas (FRAs), implies involving fishing sector and scientific institutions and national administration;\n\nenhance cooperation to further strengthen the capacity and resilience of agri food sector through the establishment and utilization of EU financial support mechanism in case of crises, such as extreme weather phenomena, severe market disturbances or occurrence of animal and plant diseases;\n\nharmonize the monitoring of marine invasive alien species in accordance with the internationally accepted management policies.
