        "text": "Situated in the heart of Europe, only two or three hours flight distance to any European destination, Croatia, with its highly developed road and railway network, and the network of seaports, inland ports and airports, as well as inland waterways and intermodal terminals, represents the central link between Europe and the world. The network of modern motorways, placing Croatia together with leading European countries, provides a possibility of fast and uninterrupted travel. International transport corridors pass through Croatia, the country is 100% digitized, with its entire territory covered by broadband Internet. Its highly developed gas distribution network places it at the very top of European countries. All of this makes Croatia an ideal transport, communication and energy intermediary, not only among countries in the region, but between the Mediterranean and the rest of the world.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia has been a full member of the European Union since 1st July 2013, with all the rights and obligations arising from said membership. With the EU membership, Croatia became part of a single internal market and a customs union. The internal market is characterized by the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour, and a common trade policy and agricultural policy. In the European Single Market, which is made up of 27 Member States, goods, services, capital and people can move freely, as within a single country, without obstacles represented by state borders. The Customs Union is characterized by common customs regulations and free trade between the EU Member States.\n\nMOTIVE NO. 1: CLEAR LEGAL FRAMEWORK INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 2: CUSTOMS SYSTEM\n\nMOTIVE NO. 3: ENTREPRENEURIAL ZONES\n\nMOTIVE NO. 4: TAX RELIEF\n\nMOTIVE NO. 5: INSTRUMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 6: DOUBLE TAXATION AVOIDANCE AGREEMENTS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 7: FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 8: AGREEMENTS ON THE PROMOTION AND MUTUAL PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 9: PREFERENTIAL EXPORT REGIME\n\nMOTIVE NO. 10: ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE IN CROATIA FROM FOREIGN CITIZENS\n\nMOTIVE NO. 1: CLEAR LEGAL FRAMEWORK INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS\n\nForeign investments in Croatia are regulated by the Companies Act, the Investment Promotion Act, the Act on Strategic Investment Projects of the Republic of Croatia and other laws.\n\nThe Investment Promotion Act (OG 102/15, 25/18, 114/18, 32/20, 20/21) regulates the allocation of state aid to encourage investments by legal entities or natural persons registered in the Republic of Croatia liable for payment of corporate income tax and engaged in economic activity and trade of goods and services in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nThe aid regulated by this Act relates to investment projects and strengthening competitive capability in:\n\nmanufacturing and processing industry,\n\ndevelopment and innovation activities,\n\nbusiness support activities\n\nhigh value-added services which simultaneously ensure environmentally safe entrepreneurial activity and one or more of the following objectives:\n\nintroduction of new equipment and modern technologies,\n\nhigher employment rate and better employee training,\n\n­development of high value-added products and services,\n\n­increasing entrepreneurial competitiveness,\n\n­uniform regional development of the Republic of Croatia,\n\n­economic activation of inactive assets owned by the Republic of Croatia,\n\nproductivity growth of economic entities in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nInvestment, initial investment or investment project under the provisions of the Act is an investment in long-term assets registered as property of the beneficiary of the aid, in a minimum amount of EUR 150,000 in kuna counter value, or a minimum amount of EUR 50,000 in kuna equivalent for microentrepreneurs subject to the requirement of opening at least five new jobs related to the investment, or three for microentrepreneurs or a minimum amount of EUR 50,000 in kuna equivalent and subject to the requirement of opening at least ten new jobs for the Centres for Development of Information and Communication Systems and Software, or a minimum amount of EUR 500,000 in kuna equivalent for investment projects in modernising and increasing business process productivity.\n\nInitial investment is an investment in tangible and intangible assets related to the establishment of a new business unit, expansion of capacity of an existing business unit, diversification of a business unit’s production to products that the business unit has not previously produced or fundamental change in the overall production process of an existing business unit.\n\nMinimum investment for incentives:\n\nEUR 50,000 and opening three new jobs - micro-entrepreneurs or\n\nEUR 150,000 and opening five new jobs - small, medium and large entrepreneurs or\n\nEUR 50,000 and opening at least 10 new jobs for the Centres for Development of Information and Communication Systems and Software or\n\n€ 500,000 for investment projects in modernising and increasing business process productivity.\n\nThe Act prescribes following incentive measures:\n\ntax incentives for micro-entrepreneurs\n\ntax incentives for small, medium and large entrepreneurs\n\naid for justified costs of new jobs related to the investment project\n\naid for justified training costs associated with the investment project\n\naid for:\n\ndevelopment and innovation activities\n\nbusiness support activities and\n\nactivities of high value added services\n\naid for capital costs of the investment project\n\naid for labour-intensive investment projects\n\naid for the economic activation of inactive assets owned by the Republic of Croatia\n\nincentive measures for the modernisation of business processes - automation, robotisation and digitalisation of production and manufacturing processes.\n\nMOTIVE NO. 2: CUSTOMS SYSTEM\n\nFor a business conducted between two economic operators on a single EU market to be based on free movement of goods and services, trade is conducted without customs formalities, i.e. without carrying out customs supervision of the goods and collecting customs charges.\n\nCommodity exchanges between EU Member States and third countries are subject to common EU customs legislation, binding on all Member States, and the Common Customs Tariff.

Imports of good of non-preferential origin from third countries shall be subject to the Common Customs Tariff of the EU.\n\nAn overview of all concluded trade agreements, the status of the agreements being negotiated and a possible search for EU trade relations with third countries and regions is available at the website of the European Commission.\n\nAn overview of the status of the agreements being negotiated is available at the web site of the European Council.\n\nMOTIVE NO. 8: AGREEMENTS ON THE PROMOTION AND MUTUAL PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS\n\nThe EU handles foreign direct investment policies on behalf of its members.

A foreign natural or legal person may acquire the right of ownership of real property, in line with the principle of reciprocity and the consent of the Ministry of Justice, according to the Act on Ownership and Other Real Rights, with the exception of citizens and legal entities from EU Member States for which there are no such restrictions."
