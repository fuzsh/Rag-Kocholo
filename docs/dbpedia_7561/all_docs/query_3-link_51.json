Founded in 1963 by the University of Zagreb and the Croatian Chamber of Commerce as the Africa Research Institute, the Institute has changed its name several times, reflecting the changes in scholarly focus.\n\nThe fundamental mission of the Institute is developing and disseminating theoretical, methodological and technical knowledge and skills required for the scientific and professional interpretation and evaluation of contemporary international relations which affect various human activities and related developmental trends important for the Republic of Croatia. Development tendencies are observed in the local, regional, European and global context. The Institute has 44 employees out of which 16 are tenured academic staff and 7 are doctoral or postdoctoral researchers."
