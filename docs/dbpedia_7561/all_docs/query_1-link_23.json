        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) join forces to support the Mediterranean countries and regional partners in their efforts to address the challenges of climate change.\n\nThe Mediterranean Basin is widely considered a climate change hotspot exceeding the global average atmospheric warming rates, and the impacts are already being felt. More severe droughts and heatwaves but also extreme precipitation following the season, higher risks of forest fires and changes in sea level, temperature and acidification are already an everyday reality for the millions living by or visiting the shores of the Mare Nostrum.\n\nThe region’s millenary cultural heritage and its unique and diverse agriculture production are not spared from these profound impacts. The agreement between the UfM and C3S has a special focus on providing new tools for mitigation and adaptation to all stakeholders in the region.\n\nThe partnership aims to make available to the largest number of institutions the wealth of data provided by the ECMWF implemented Copernicus Services: the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).\n\nFind here the applications and the stories showing how the CAMS / C3S can contribute to analyze the past and present and anticipate the future impacts of climate change and air pollution in the Mediterranean.\n\nApplications\n\nTwo applications built on Copernicus infrastructure using the freely available data in the Climate Data Store have been developed covering topics identified as high priority to the Mediterranean region.\n\nThe first instance considers the impact of sea level rise on UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Mediterranean Basin. The second application deals with the health sector and specifically considers the impact of climate change on the suitability of Mediterranean habitats for air-borne vectors of disease.\n\nMore applications are to be developed in further phases.\n\nExtreme sea levels on Mediterranean UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nWith sea levels rising at an average rate of 2.8 ±0.1 mm per year over the last 30 years in the Mediterranean Sea, there is an urgent need to protect the region’s rich cultural heritage from coastal flooding. Today, many UNESCO-World Heritage Sites across the low-lying coastal areas of the Mediterranean face the risk of flooding, especially during extreme storm surge conditions. Predicting these coastal flood events is particularly difficult due to the complex spatial and temporal variations observed in sea level rise and storm incidence across the Mediterranean region.\n\nIn order to better understand the future trends across the most exposed locations, there is a pressing need for high-quality data. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) offers robust, quality-assured, climate data ready to support the stakeholders and key players of cultural heritage protection.\n\nIn partnership with the Union for the Mediterranean, Copernicus has developed a web-based application that demonstrates how climate data can provide easy-to-use information to the cultural heritage sector.\n\nUsing a simplified coastal flood index, the application displays 50 UNESCO World Heritage Sites classified by their flooding risk by 2050, assuming projected trends in sea level and based on 1 in a 100 year-event storm surge levels (1979-2018 data).\n\nSea level rise is impacting the Mediterranean region's cultural heritage. Many UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Mediterranean are situated on the coast and are therefore under increasing risk from coastal flooding from sea level rise and extreme storm surge events. This application demonstrates how climate data may be harnessed to explore the risk from coastal flooding to a number of world heritage sites in the Mediterranean, based on a 1 in 100 year extreme event combined with sea level projections for the year 2050.\n\n…loading application…\n\nExplore the app in the CDS\n\nUsers can see how five world heritage sites are at high risk of flooding in the event of a once-in-100-year flood, and a further 33 sites are at medium risk of flooding around the Mediterranean basin.\n\nThese risk categories mean that at least part of the world heritage site would be inundated by flooding during a 100-year extreme event due to rising sea levels and their low elevation. Only twelve of the fifty listed sites are classified as low risk.\n\nThe web-based application illustrates how climate data can help prioritise efforts for adaptation, support the distribution of resources, and planning the development of more complex and accurate models with local-scale data.\n\nSuch visualisations are particularly relevant since considerable efforts have been engaged in recent years to bolster basin-wide planning and management plans such as the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean (2008), the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development 2016-2025 (2016), and the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Framework for the Mediterranean Marine and Coastal Areas (2017).\n\nThe app has been developed using the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). All the data and applications in the CDS are available for free without any restriction of use.\n\nClimate suitability of air-borne vectors of disease in the Mediterranean Region\n\nClimate change in the Mediterranean region is transforming the environmental suitability for many species – some of which are vectors of human disease. The changes in temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns influence the spread of air-borne vector diseases and facilitates the settling of new species in new areas.\n\nThese air-borne vector diseases reach new populations which can result in unforeseen strain on public health systems.\n\nMosquitoes can transmit malaria, dengue, chikunguya, and zika diseases, to name just a few. Warming temperatures in the Mediterranean are allowing mosquitoes to populate new areas, especially in highlands that are becoming warmer and were previously mosquito free. In particular, the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) has spread to the Mediterranean and it is reported that climatic factors have increased the areas suitable for the establishment of tiger mosquito across Europe.\n\nIn partnership with the Union for the Mediterranean, Copernicus has developed a web-based application demonstrating how climate data can provide easy-to-use information supporting the public health sector.\n\nUsing ecological and climate models, the app displays the areas of climate suitability and the active season length for mosquitoes calculated and projected until 2100.\n\nUsers can click in any part of the Mediterranean bioclimatic zone – the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea - and retrieve detailed information for that location under two future climate IPCC scenarios: RCP4.5 & RCP8.5.\n\nBased on the C3S data available on the Climate Data Store, users can trust the quality and robustness of the climate projections.\n\nThe climatic suitability for air-borne vectors of human diseases is predicted to change under future climate change scenarios in many parts of the Mediterranean region. Increased climatic suitability is likely to lead to the increased transmission of diseases as well as the potential introduction of new diseases to the region.\n\nExplore the map which present the climatic suitability for the Mediterranean bioclimatic region (green boundary). The data is based on bias adjusted output from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble of climate models. The historical period of the EURO-CORDEX simulations runs up to 2005 and the estimates from 2005 to 2100 are based on projections following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Data has been omitted in locations where the season length is less than one week.\n\n…loading application…\n\nExplore the app in the CDS\n\nBy exploring the different areas in the application it’s clearly seen how the climate suitability for mosquitoes is not distributed evenly across the Mediterranean region. Under the two climate scenarios, optimal suitability conditions for mosquitoes evidently moves northwards and intensifies in hilly areas of the Northern Mediterranean basin where the active season length increases over the century.\n\nWith the increase in drought conditions and rising temperatures projected for the Mediterranean region the presence of the tiger mosquito decreases in some areas, raising the issue of a potential changing disease profile on the local population and forcing local authorities to actively monitor and adapt to new vector-borne diseases.\n\nThe use of freely available and quality-assured climate data from Copernicus to support public health initiatives across the Mediterranean basin allows stakeholders to invest in long-term public health campaigns taking into account the complex and changing risk profiles for diseases.\n\nUser stories\n\nOther stories relevant to the region:\n\nUse cases\n\nMore examples\n\nData products relevant to the region\n\nCMIP6 climate projection\n\nCORDEX regional climate models\n\nERA5 hourly on single levels\n\nERA5-Land hourly\n\nSea level daily gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present\n\nExplore the CDS\n\nEvents & trainings\n\nCultural Heritage and climate risk: Putting Copernicus earth observation data to work in the Mediterranean region, COP27\n\nHealth and climate risk: Putting Copernicus earth observation data to work in the Mediterranean region, COP27\n\nFind out more about our events\n\nECMWF and Copernicus are supporting the Union for the Mediterranean in preparing user training to maximise the uptake of climate and atmospheric composition data for the benefit of users in the Mediterranean region. Targeted training material and training sessions are currently being formulated covering the overarching objectives of enhancing skills training, knowledge transfer and capacity building.\n\nCopernicus' User Learning Service offers free training on the use of the Climate Data Store platform and its content. A number of Jupyter notebook tutorials are available, which demonstrate how to access and process data from the Climate and Atmosphere Data Stores. Those related to C3S data can be found here and those related to CAMS data are available here.\n\nFuture plans\n\nIn the next stages, further applications and training will be co-developed with the end user focused on topics identified in collaboration with the users, for example, the energy sector. Users will be invited to participate in tailored training sessions and access training material on the Mediterranean region in order to support skills training, knowledge transfer and capacity building.\n\nFAQ"
