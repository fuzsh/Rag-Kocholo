The marketing authorization for novel therapies is often time consuming and distressing for patients. Earlier clinical trials were the only way to access new drugs under development. However, not every patient meets the enrolment criteria, and participation is difficult for patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously debilitating diseases like rare diseases. Early access programs like “Compassionate Use Program (CUP)” have generated alternative channels for such patients. The European Medical Agency provides regulations and recommendations for compassionate use, upon which every European Union (EU) member state has developed its own rules and regulations. Despite previous reviews and studies, the available information is limited and gaps exist. This literature review explores CUP in 28 EU member states. Data was collected through literature review and use of country-specific search terms from the healthcare domain. Data sources were not limited to databases and articles published in journals, but also included grey literature. The results implied that CUP was present in 20 EU member states (71%). Of 28 EU states, 18 (∼64%) had nationalized regulations and processes were well-defined. Overall, this review identified CUP and its current status and legislation in 28 EU member states. The established legislation for CUP in the EU member states suggest their willingness to adopt processes that facilitate earlier and better access to new medicines. Further research and periodic reviews are warranted to understand the contemporary and future regulatory trends in early access programs.\n\nKeywords: Compassionate use, early access, special access, rare diseases, orphan drugs, European Union, European Union member states\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe past decade has seen rapid development in the field of novel drugs and therapeutic biological agents. Despite the remarkable innovations that took place in the field of novel therapeutics, marketing authorization for promising novel therapies is time consuming, which can be at times distressing for some patients, particularly, those with severe diseases (1). This implies a serious bearing on the overall quality of life in such patients, because treatment can be challenging and at times inadequate with currently authorized medicines (1). Hence, new drugs that are unauthorized or in the late phase of clinical trials are the only hope for a plausible successful treatment in such patients.\n\nIn the past, clinical trials were the only way for patients in many countries to access drugs under development (2). However, clinical trials are time-consuming and expensive, and not every patient meets enrolment criteria for specific clinical trials (1). Also, participation in clinical trials is a difficult choice for patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously debilitating diseases. Nonetheless, in recent times, early access programs have opened doors to more possibilities for such patients, of which “Compassionate Use Program (CUP)” is one. There are approximately 7,000 different types of rare diseases (3). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 350 million people suffer from rare diseases of which around 8.6% are from Europe (3). Since 2010, the number of compassionate use requests has risen by nearly 25% and a major proportion of these requests are from rare disease patient populations, owing to highly engaged patients and caregivers connected to advocacy groups (4). Many pharmaceutical companies are developing new therapies for patients with rare, life-threatening genetic diseases and are also facilitating access to such drugs (5). Lately, Genzyme Corporation has donated imiglucerase to hundreds of severely affected patients with Gaucher's disease in three large-scale international CUP (6,7). Such efforts by pharma majors to improve early access to life-threatening disease drugs makes it essential to understand CUP and the processes involved.\n\nCUP are early access programs intended to facilitate the availability of new medicines to patients suffering with life threatening disorders or diseases in the EU member states ( ) (6). In general, CUP are considered in the early stages of the product development cycle where patients get pre-launch access to the investigational drugs or drugs not yet authorized in the country. Unlike clinical trials, which are protocol driven and where participants have to meet certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, CUP allows patients without considering any criteria. But, CUP enrolls patients as per the laws and regulations outlined for the program (2). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) defines “compassionate use” as a treatment option that allows the use of an unauthorized medicinal product which is under development (8).\n\nThe EMA provides recommendations for compassionate use through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Also, laws and regulations are set by the EMA for compassionate use in the European Union (EU) ( ) (8–11). Every EU member state has developed its own legislation for CUP based on the EMA recommendations and legal framework. Therefore, it is necessary for stakeholders such as, health professionals, patients and patient organizations, pharmaceutical companies and policy makers to be informed of legislation and processes that facilitate or gain access to innovative medicines at the earliest.\n\nTable 1.\n\nArticle 6 of Directive 2001/83/EC1 of the EU requires that medicinal products be authorized before they are marketed in a community. Previously, a clinical trial was the only option for using unauthorized medicinal products. However, CUP created a treatment option for patients in the EU suffering from a disease without existing satisfactory authorized therapy alternatives or who could not be part of a clinical trial. The EMA recommends compassionate use through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and a legal framework.Article 83 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 introduces the legal framework for compassionate use in the EU for medicinal products eligible to be authorized via the Centralized Procedure, stating that “By way of exemption from Article 6 of Directive 2001/83/EC, MS may make a medicinal product for human use belonging to the categories referred to in Article 3(1) and 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 available for compassionate use”.\n\nDespite the availability of previous reviews and studies on CUP and related processes in the EU member states, the available information is superficial and limited to selected countries in the EU (2,6,12). Besides, a few gaps exist in the literature, due to changes and revisions of regulations and pathways that happen over time (13). Hence, there is a dearth of information in the published literature on existing CUP and current trends in all EU member states. Therefore, through this literature review we explored the presence of CUP in 28 EU member states to bridge the gaps for a better understanding of the legislation and specifics on CUP in every state.\n\nThe objectives of this review are to appraise the existing structure and processes for CUP in 28 EU member states, consolidate the information and present it as a comprehensive overview of the program in the countries.\n\n2. Methodology\n\nData was collected through an extensive literature review process to present the consolidated information. First, search terms like “compassionate use,” “expanded access,” “patient access programs,” “medicines/drugs regulations,” and “access to new drugs” were defined and included for each member state. Data was extracted using the country-specific search terms from diverse fields of study such as: health policies, medicines for rare diseases, pricing and reimbursement, health care access, health services research, and Federal documents. Iterative database (PubMed MEDLINE) searches were conducted to retrieve articles related to CUP. Since the subject required a thorough and systematic search for literature on regulations and CUP details, the data sources were not limited to articles published in journals, but also included grey literature. The sources for grey literature included: i) Government websites of respective countries; ii) Institutional repositories like the EU Commission, EMA and Rare Diseases Europe (Eurordis); iii) The EUR-Lex for legal documents portraying the medical laws, acts and compassionate use; iv) Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE); v) OpenGrey; vi) Google; and vii) Others (blogs, newsletters and forums).\n\nAdditionally, a reference list of relevant articles was reviewed to find other studies. Subsequently, after abstract sifting, relevant articles that described CUP, its regulations and other related information for each member state were retrieved for further study. In instances where the current CUP information in a member state could not be ascertained or was not retrievable through literature search, it was labeled as unavailable. Data were recorded based on a set of three key themes: i) The CUP and a brief overview of the program including its definition in 28 EU member states; ii) National regulations on CUP in each of the 28 EU member states; iii) National authorities responsible for CUP.\n\nFor the purpose of this review, the countries under study were stratified into six factions. The EU5 countries are the first faction as they are referred to the most. The rest of the five factions comprise countries classified based on United Nations Geoscheme namely: Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Asia. Specific insights from the literature are presented as tables and charts for a meaningful comparison of CUP legislation and processes among the EU member states.\n\n3. Findings\n\n3.1. Early access program\n\nMost of the EU member states have special programs that facilitate early patient access to new medicines through a national authority (14,15). However, the prevailing early access programs are known by various names in each country such as CUP, special access program, Named Patient Program (NPP), managed access program etc. (2,16–20). Moreover, these terms vary based on geographic location and are often used interchangeably. Also, they can imply different ideas with respect to the geographic area (18). Nonetheless, all these programs make a drug available to a patient prior to authorization and commercial launch in the country (2,18).\n\n3.2. Regulations for CUP\n\nThis literature review reports the most recent CUP related processes in the EU member states. The appraisal of available literature such as government websites and reports revealed a strong evidence of adoption of CUP. There was a significantly positive correlation between the EU and individual country laws and recommendations. The results from the reviewed literature on CUP are summarized in to . The tables compile the definition and an overview of CUP along with the medicinal products under it. On the whole, CUP was in place in 20 EU member states (71%) ( ). These countries were Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom (UK). The remaining eight countries (Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland and Slovakia) belonged in one of these categories: i) Did not have a CUP regulation or process; ii) No information was available; iii) Lack of clarity in the retrieved and available information.\n\nTable 2.\n\nItemsFranceGermanyItalySpainUKAuthority involvedAgence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM)German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI)Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA)Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS)Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)Laws and regulationsArticle L5121-12 and Article R5121-68\n\nSection 21 (2) no.6, German Medicinal Product Act (AMG), in conjunction with Article 83 of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004\n\nOrdinance on Medicinal Products for Compassionate Use as per Section 80 of the German Medicinal Product Act was published on 21 July 2010 in the Federal Law Gazette 2010 part I No 37 and enforced on 22 July 2010\n\nA Ministerial Decree of 8 May 2003 Law no. 326 of 24 November 2003 on the price and reimbursement system\n\nAlso, the national legislation, Law 648/96, makes compassionate use possible at the National Health System's (SSN) expense\n\nReal Decreto 1015 of 19th June 2009 Cohort or Nominative\n\nHuman Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916)\n\nThe Guidance Note 14 on ‘The supply of unlicensed relevant medicinal products for individual patients’ Nominative\n\nOverviewThe conditions for ATU:\n\nSpecialties are to treat, prevent or diagnose serious or rare diseases\n\nNo proper treatment\n\nEfficiency and job security are presumed as per the scientific knowledge\n\nAlso, there are two types of ATU:\n\nCohort ATU - for a group or sub-group of registered patients\n\nATU — nominative - for named single patient\n\nMedicinal products for human use can be used for specific groups of patients without marketing authorization or previous approval in GermanyAn unauthorized medication can be included by AIFA in the official list to be prescribed at the NHS charge, if it is for a specific disease with no therapeutic choice.

These countries are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. The decisions were managed and approvals were granted by a competent National Agency in the countries where CUP existed (12).\n\nAccording to this review, few countries lack official CUP and regulations. Every EU member state has nationalized regulations based on the EU framework. The national CUP makes medicinal products available either to individuals (NPP) or cohorts of patients governed by every member state's legislation. However, named patient basis is not CUP as per the EU regulations. So, the doctor responsible for the treatment contacts the manufacturer directly (9,19–21). CUP in 28 member states categorized by UN Geoscheme are summarized below.\n\nCUP in EU5: France has an elaborate scheme for CUP called Temporary Authorizations for Use (ATU). It allows the exceptional use of medicinal products without a marketing authorization and not subject to a clinical trial. The program is well-defined with structured regulations and procedures in the rest of EU5 namely Germany, Italy, Spain and UK ( ) (12,22–38).\n\nCUP in Western European countries: Among Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands, Luxembourg did not have CUP ( ) (12,31,39–46).\n\nTable 3.\n\nItemsAustriaBelgiumLuxembourgNetherlandsAuthority involvedAustrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (Bundesamt für Sicherheit im Gesundheitswesen, BASG)Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP)Direction de la Santé Villa Louvigny Division de la Pharmacie et des MedicamentsMedicines Evaluation BoardLaws and regulations8a Austrian Medicinal Products Act (AMG)\n\nBelgian law 1 May 2006 Art.6 quater point 2 (modifications ofmodifications of the loi du 25 mars 1964 sur les médicaments)\n\nArticles 106 and 107 in the Royal Decree executive measures of the Law 1 May 2006 (However, The Royal Decree of 25 April 2014 amending the Royal Decree of 14 December 2006 on medicinal products for human and veterinary use was published and is effective since July 2014)\n\nRegulations specifically for CUP are absent.

Though there is a regulatory procedure for CUP in Malta, there is no official legislation. Compassionate use of medicines in individual patients is documented, but there is a dearth of clarity whether this is NPP or CUP. Croatia, Portugal and Slovenia have CUP with national regulations ( ) (12,31,59–68).\n\nTable 5.\n\nItemsCroatiaGreeceMaltaPortugalSloveniaAuthority involvedMinistarstvo zdravlja (Ministry of Health) and The Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of Croatia (HALMED)National Organization for MedicinesMalta Medicines AuthorityInstituto Nacional da Farmacia e do Medicamento (INFARMED)Javna agencija RS za zdravila in medicinske pripomočke - Public Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (JAZMP)Laws and regulationsPursuant to Article 73 of the Medicinal Products Act (Official Gazette 71/07 and 45/09) ordinance on pharmacovigilanceInformation unavailable (may be in progress)\n\nThough there is a pharmaceutical regulatory procedure, no official national legislation exists\n\nUnlicensed medicinal products as directed in DH Circular 137/2004 (updated version DH Circular 270/06 - Health concerning the “Guidelines Governing the Use of Medicinal Products for Human Use without a Marketing Authorization” is different from CUP\n\nFurther information unavailable\n\nArticles 92–93 of the Decreto Lei no. 176 of 30th August 2006\n\nINFARMED'S Decision 105/CA/2007, of 1 March 2007\n\nNominative\n\n83 Article 6 Medicines Act (Official Gazette of RS, no. 17/14)Overview\n\nIt is possible to adopt compassionate use from diagnosis to the approval to use the drug\n\nCompassionate use facilitates access to unauthorized medicinal products for chronic, serious, or a life-threatening diseases which cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product\n\nCompassionate use of medicines for individual patients exists.

Implementation and streamlining CUP is in progress. No further information available.\n\nCUP in Asia: There are no regulations allowing access to unauthorized medicinal products outside clinical trials in Cyprus ( ) (83).\n\n3.3. Recent changes\n\nThe literature review deduces that countries like Hungary and Sweden, without national legislation previously, have now formulated them (13). Newly shaped policies and regulations have resulted due to higher demand for CUP, especially for orphan drugs for rare diseases. Clear regulations aid in systematizing CUP and providing better access to medicines. For instance, more than 20,000 patients were treated with over 200 products under French legislation for compassionate use by 2007 (84). A study on all ATUs with marketing authorization between 01 January, 2005, and 30 June, 2010, concluded that the licensing and public bodies' review time was shortened by a combined total of 36 months. Also, the French ATU program accelerated the availability of new drugs in spite of the longer standard administrative path (85). Since 2006, the EU member states submitted more than 50 CUP notifications to the EMA, of which around two-fifths were for orphan medicinal products (6).\n\n3.4. Benefits of CUP\n\nImplementing early access programs like CUP has multifold benefits, both to patients and pharmaceutical companies (18,86–92). First, CUPs benefit patients unable to participate in clinical trials due to mobility issues or who fail to fulfill the eligibility criteria (13). They are also preferred when no treatment options are available or access to investigational drug/biologics/medical devices is the last resort for patients suffering from serious diseases/disorders (13). Through early access programs, patients have access to promising drugs at an earlier stage during the life cycle, for instance, post phase II. Otherwise, patients have to wait for a considerable amount of time until the drug is authorized and is on the market, if not for the early access programs (13). Second, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies provide a fast and efficient response to patient demand outside of traditional access routes due to such programs (87,90). Early access facilitates the smoother transition of a drug from clinical trials to the market and also prepares companies to develop global launch strategies based on global usage patterns and market landscape predictions (86,88,89). Besides, the market authorization holders get the opportunity to resolve any product related issues and can overcome challenges encountered by pre-approved drugs through early access (19,88). Above all, early access furnishes valuable information pertaining to real world evidence for practice and further research (18,20). Furthermore, patients, physicians and patient organizations are increasingly becoming aware of the possibilities to access a drug through such early access programs. Moreover, the existing framework for compassionate use in the EU member states can be effectively utilized to plan new access programs. For instance, the adaptive pathways approach, a scientific concept for medicine development and data generation, is part of the EMA's efforts to improve timely access for patients to new medicines that utilize the existing EU regulatory framework for medicines (93,94).\n\n3.5. Challenges in implementing CUP\n\nThe governments and pharmaceutical companies are taking steps to implement CUP considering the benefits and importance of early access to drugs. However, it is highly challenging and complex for pharmaceutical companies to initiate early access programs like CUP. First, despite the existing EU Regulations, pharmaceutical companies face challenges as the regulations vary from country to country. This mandates regulators, policy makers and other key stakeholders to streamline processes and create transparency. Second, innovative drugs are relatively expensive and are becoming increasingly difficult for governments and payers to include them in their reimbursement schemes. This mandates for clearly set regulations and rationalized procedures to help patients, patient organizations and physicians for better access to drugs. Additionally, it is imperative for pharmaceutical companies to be updated on these regulations and processes on CUP for easier entrance into a market.\n\n3.6. Strengths and limitations of this study\n\nThis review has its own strengths and limitations. Previously, the information available publicly on CUP, especially on legislation was limited and in many cases outdated when compared with the available grey literature (6,12,13). However, the current systematic search addresses these gaps by including data from grey literature and peer-reviewed journal articles. Despite the efforts by researchers to capture all the available data, there still exist a few gaps in the literature. For instance, information on CUP is not available online for certain member states where CUP is still in the initial stages.\n\n4. Conclusion and recommendations\n\nOverall, this review identified the presence of CUP and highlighted its current status and legislation in 28 EU member states. This review found that CUP has a positive impact and potential benefits for patients and pharmaceutical companies. The established legislation for CUP in the EU member states suggests that the EU countries are ready to adopt methods for early access to medicines. An implication of this is the possibility to make new medicines available within a shorter time span for patients. Furthermore, the existing framework for compassionate use in the EU member states can pave the way for more access programs.\n\nFurther research is necessary to determine the specific phases involved in the CUP, pricing and reimbursement frameworks in countries. Case studies and success stories which reflect the benefits of such early access programs from both patients' and other stakeholders' perspectives can give the relevant impetus for education on such programs. Since inadequate information on healthcare access can often be a stumbling block for stakeholders, periodic reviews need to be taken to throw light on emerging changes within the regulatory structures, both at European and member state levels to discern market trends.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
