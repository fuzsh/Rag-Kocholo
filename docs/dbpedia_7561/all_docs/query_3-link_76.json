        "text": "The EUâs strategic neighbourhood stretches from Eastern Europe to the Caucasus, and the Western Balkans through the MENA region. Towards all of the countries in its vicinity, the EU adopts its customary approach of conditionality, hoping (and expecting) that the lure of trade and/or accession will strengthen the rule of law and human rights in the countries involved. The effectiveness of this strategy has declined in recent years, since the political elites in the EUâs neighbourhood are no longer convinced that joining the EU is possible in the near future, or indeed that EU membership remains the attractive prospect that it once was. This has opened the way for a more assertive presence by third players, which include several countries belonging to the BRICS group, but also Gulf states such as the UAE and Qatar.\n\nThis chapter examines the security implications of the BRICS challenge to the EUâs comfortable position as the âonly game in townâ, both economically and politically. Is the BRICSâ alignment mainly a âpower-multiplierâ for the national interests of individual BRICS members, or does it offer a real alternative to the liberal Western order for countries that used to be squarely in the EUâs strategic orbit? This chapter focuses on the policies of the three BRICS members with a global strategic vision: China; Russia; and (to a lesser extent) India. (Brazil and South Africa are important players in their own region, with limited â and at times no â influence in the areas surrounding the EU.) The chapter concludes with some reflections on the need for the EU to develop a more pronounced and sophisticated strategy to balance, and at times even counter, the BRICSâ influence in the EUâs backyard. Such a strategic overhaul is long overdue and â luckily â gradually gaining some support and modest momentum. We have to acknowledge that the rise of the BRICS has become a key argument for a more cohesive and integrated EU, but that the EU has no ideas and no policies to go beyond its existing strategic partnerships with all five BRICS members.\n\nAs Pascal Bruckner recently argued: âWhat [â¦] should we say about the great imperial groups constituted by Russia and China, which are neither friends nor enemies [â¦]? Their size forbids us to mount a frontal attack on them; their police practices forbid us to treat them indulgently. They are simultaneously partners and threatsâ. It is this ambiguity that seems to paralyze the EU, making the rifts and fissures within the EU on how to deal with the BRICS group larger and more profound than the differences between the individual BRICS states.\n\nChina, Russia and India in the EUâs Strategic Backyard\n\nRichard Youngs has argued that the EUâs approach towards the MENA region is based upon âvoluntary inclusion rather than imposed coercion, of shared power and partnership rather than subjugation and hard-power tutelageâ. This approach draws from the EUâs experience in Central Europe in the 1990s, and is now repeated in a very different regional context. The EU offers three incentives to the countries in its direct vicinity: money; markets; and mobility (the well-known âthree Msâ). Another âMâ can be added for the Western Balkans, where full EU membership remains a remote prospect, but is at least on the cards. The draw of the EUâs âempire by invitationâ has diminished because of the economic and financial crisis that still bogs down most of Europe and now is even escalating in a possible âGrexitâ (Greece leaving the eurozone, and possibly the EU) and a âBrexitâ (the UK is set to have a so-called âin/outâ referendum by as early as 2016). The important point to make and emphasize is that the EUâs relative weakness (vis-Ã -vis the BRICS and other emerging economies), combined with the EUâs inward-looking disposition, offers third players new opportunities to strengthen ties with traditional European allies.\n\nChinaâs strategy towards the MENA region is guided mostly by its huge and growing energy needs. In 2013, China became the Persian Gulfâs main oil client, surpassing the US. Until now, China has not been politically engaged in the MENA region, and it has kept a low profile in its relations with the Arab League states and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). This neutral, hands-off policy is, however, bound to change for two reasons. First, oil exports from the Middle East to China could double by 2035 (according to projections from the International Energy Agency). Second, the development of Chinaâs New Silk Road initiative will develop trade routes through the MENA region, which is bound to result in a more Sino-centric world. Although Chinaâs interests in the MENA region remain concentrated on the energy sector, Chinaâs financial engagement (mainly through investment in urban and transport infrastructure) has boomed over the past decade. This has made China a valued and dependable partner for almost all of the countries in the region. Beijing is âlooking for the middle in the Middle Eastâ, which means that it takes a neutral, pragmatic and generally non-interventionist position on all of the big issues of the region, including the PalestinianâIsraeli conflict, Syria and Iran. Countries in the MENA region understand that they will play a major role in Chinaâs New Silk Road strategy, which will build a modern grid of oil pipelines and roads from Asia to the Middle East and beyond. As Abbas Varij Kazemi and Xiangming Chen argue:\n\n[T]he ancient Silk Road serves as a modern-day political lens for how the Middle East and China see each otherâs development. Given their shared ancient civilizations, strong traditional values, collectivist cultures, patriarchal social systems and centralized political systems, do some Middle Eastern countries view Chinaâs model and road of development as more appealing?\n\nThe answer seems an unqualified âyesâ.\n\nThe problem for China is that with increased economic and financial engagement comes greater political responsibility. Although Beijing is reluctant to take sides in the many conflicts in the Middle East, recent (civil) wars in Libya and Syria have shown that China, too, has to take more overt political positions and use the available economic levers to further its political and security interests. Instability in the MENA region undermines Chinaâs quest for energy security, and the rising threat of Islamic extremism and Jihadism also affects Chinaâs domestic stability (mainly in its Muslim Xinjiang region). The fact that economic power engenders political power and responsibility is logical and hardly new â it explains US hegemony after the Second World War. It also explains the EUâs crumbling sway over developments in the Southern Mediterranean. For now, the EU is keen to involve China in finding multilateral solutions to MENA crises. Although this seems to be the best (and probably also only) way forward, it remains unclear whether the security interests of China and the EU are sufficiently congruent to foster a true strategic partnership.\n\nRussiaâs interests in the MENA region are diverse, ranging from energy security, capping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) â mainly in Iran â and conventional arms exports and halting the rise of radical (mainly Sunni) Islam. Interestingly, Russia has been keen to maintain its (more or less) good ties with a wide variety of MENA regimes, ranging from Assad in Syria and the mullahs in Iran, to traditional Western allies such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the GCC states, as well as Egypt, Morocco and even the Kurdish Regional Government. Like China, Russia feels vindicated in its belief that the 2011 Arab Spring would result in instability, rather than sustainable democratic reform. Moscow considered Western support for the Arab Spring movements as outside interference that was aimed at toppling traditional Russian allies, replacing them with democratic and (hence potentially) Western-oriented regimes. Russia also feared (and still fears) the rise of radical Islam in the MENA region, which will negatively impact upon stability in the North Caucasus. Russiaâs interests and politicoâsecurity agenda in the MENA region are therefore conservative, opposing democratization and supporting authoritarian regimes (as long as they are not Sunni, like Qatar and Saudi Arabia), but unlike China, Russia lacks the economic and financial levers to back up its interests.\n\nRussia tries to overcome its economic weakness by exploiting the traditional tactic of military support and arms exports to gain a legitimate entrance, influence and status. MENA states have ample access to a booming global arms market, which include Western defence industries. Still, Russian military presence in the Mediterranean is growing, and now includes naval bases in Syria and Cyprus [see Box 2: The BRICSâ Impact on Greece and Cyprus].\n\nBox 2 The BRICSâ Impact on Greece and Cyprus\n\nThe banking crises in Cyprus and Greece show that the BRICSâ growing economic and financial power can put Western institutions under considerable pressure. While negotiating a bailout package with the European Union, the Cypriot government announced that loans from Moscow or Beijing were also being considered. Cypriot President Demetris Christofias claimed that the Russians were âgood friends [who] take care of Cyprusâ. He recalled Russiaâs â¬2.5 billion loan to Cyprus (in 2011), ostensibly given âwithout anything in exchangeâ. The Cypriot government also raised the possibility of turning to China. In an effort to strengthen relations with Beijing, Cypriot Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Neoklis Sylikiotis and Chairman of the Cyprus Popular Bank Michalis Sarris paid a joint visit to Beijing to discuss the possibility of a Chinese loan.\n\nIn 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras opted for the same approach. During the negotiations with Brussels, his Syriza government stated that âif there is no deal, and if we see that Germany remains rigid and wants to blow Europe apart, then we will have to go to Plan Bâ. Seeking to strengthen relationships with Russia, Tsipras paid three visits to Moscow, where he discussed a major pipeline project in Greece (possibly in exchange for a loan from Russia). The Greek prime minister stated that Greece could serve as âa link and bridge between Russia and Europeâ, and distanced himself from European sanctions against Russia by calling them âa road to nowhereâ. In exchange, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would âpositively examineâ a Greek request for loans. To strengthen relations with Beijing, Greek Deputy Prime Minister Yannis Dragasakis, together with Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, paid a five-day visit to Beijing in March 2015 to look for financial support from China. In return for reviving the privatization of the Greek port of Piraeus, China invested some â¬100 million in Greek treasury bills.\n\nBoth Russia and China have geopolitical interests in Cyprus and Greece. For Russia, Greece and Cyprus play a key role in Moscowâs energy strategy, and also offer an alternative to the Russian naval facility in Tartus (Syria), which is now compromised by the on-going Syrian war. In addition, Cyprus serves as a safe haven for the dirty money of Russian oligarchs. Greece and Cyprus also play an important role in Chinaâs New Silk Road initiative. China is seeking to invest in Greek and Cypriot infrastructure (railroads and ports) and has already invested considerably in the Greek port of Piraeus.\n\nStill, a bailout by China or Russia has never been a serious option. Russia simply lacks the deep financial pockets to offer either country a comprehensive bailout package. Moscow may also balk at further exacerbating its already poor relationship with the West. Moreover, Greece and Cyprus are not the big geopolitical prizes that they are sometimes made out to be. For Cyprus and Greece, it has been opportune to hint at a âPlan Bâ (namely, Russia and China), while pressing Western creditors to grant them loans on more favourable terms. Upholding this story was also convenient to Russia and China, since it further undermined the power of Western-dominated global financial institutions and demonstrated intra-EU divisions. This has proved of special significance for Moscow, since it offered some relief from the EUâs political pressure on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.\n\nRead more...\n\nInterestingly, Cyprus â which is, of course, an EU member state â has sought Russian (military) support in its quarrels with (NATO member) Turkey over gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean. This is part of Russiaâs scheme to restore its status as a great power, capable of preventing a Western-dominated geopolitical order, and if needs be by military means. This Clingendael Report has already quoted Niall Ferguson, who observed that because of Russiaâs own energy reserves, Moscow has no vested interest in stability in the Middle East. In reality, however, Russiaâs at times radical rhetoric does not match its rather conservative approach towards the MENA region. Moscow may aim to annoy and thwart the West where it can, but overall has few economic, political and military tools at its disposal to wreak havoc. Since Chinaâs strategy is equally guided by conservatism, the EU is faced with considerable pressure to maintain the status quo in a region still bogged down by autocracy.\n\nThe role and influence of India, Brazil and South Africa in the MENA region is modest. Brazil is strengthening its economic presence in Africa and is becoming an aid donor, promoting democracy and human rights (much like the EU). South Africaâs emphasis on SouthâSouth cooperation includes the MENA region, but does not offer it a special position. Indiaâs strategy towards the MENA region is mainly motivated by economic interests and ensuring the safety of the large Indian diaspora, mainly in the Gulf region. The Middle East and the Gulf states have become Indiaâs main trading partners over the past decade, which explains why Delhi was reluctant to support the popular uprisings during the Arab Spring. India has also remained on the sidelines during the UNSC votes on Syria and Libya, where it abstained (in both cases, along with Brazil).\n\nThe EUâs Vulnerable Southern Flank\n\nSimilar patterns of policy behaviour by the BRICS members are discernible in other regions adjacent to the EU, such as the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe. Ever since China obtained (in 2009) a 35-year concession period from Athens to operate two shipping terminals in the Greek port of Piraeus, the EU has woken up to Chinaâs assertive and highly successful entry into the Western Balkans. This does not, however, make China a key player in the region yet. But Chinaâs attraction is on the rise, for the same reasons that the âBeijing Modelâ has appeal in Africa and other developing regions: Chinaâs immense market; its lack of political conditionality; and its willingness to invest in energy and infrastructure projects. China is increasing its economic and trade ties with Serbia, as well as with Macedonia and Montenegro. As LoÃ¯c Poulain argues: âBecause money and influence are closely intertwined, Beijingâs sizeable investments in South-Eastern Europe are as much about financial returns as they are about leverageâ. It is little surprise, therefore, that Chinaâs Peopleâs Liberation Army (PLA) has stepped up military cooperation in the region, and has deepened its ties with all of the countries of the Western Balkans, apart from Kosovo (which China does not recognize). Politically, this means that Serbia is usually not willing to join EU declarations condemning Chinaâs human rights record; in return, China supports Serbia in its stand over Kosovo. The EU-brokered deal between Serbia and Kosovo of August 2015 is unlikely to alter this dynamic.\n\nAlong similar lines, Russiaâs ties with Serbia go beyond a shared (Russian Orthodox) religion, and now centre on the regionâs key role as a transit route for the South Stream pipeline, connecting Russiaâs eastern gas fields to Central and Western Europe. Since South Stream will circumvent Ukraine and link Russia closer to several key (Balkan) states (most notably Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Greece, Slovenia, Austria and Croatia), the project carries major geostrategic significance. Serbia is keeping its options open vis-Ã -vis Russia, including by becoming a permanent observer in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and by signing (in November 2013) a bilateral agreement on military cooperation with Moscow. Russia is also raising its profile as a regional trading partner, particularly in Serbia and the Republika Srpska (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). Although Russiaâs ambitions in the region remain unclear, recent experiences in Ukraine indicate that the âWestern Balkans are treated by Moscow as a proxy playground in a wider geopolitical competition with the EU and the USâ.\n\nInterestingly â and, arguably, worryingly â this geostrategic playground now also includes two EU member states that have proven economically vulnerable and politically susceptible to Russian and Chinese influence. In June 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met with BRICS Bank (now the NDB) representatives to negotiate a multi-billion US dollar loan. Under pressure from the EU to agree with another package of austerity measures, Greece felt obliged to look for alternatives, including China. Greece has already signed a deal with Russia to create a joint enterprise for the construction of the so-called Turkish Stream pipeline, which will run across Greek territory. A possible Greek exit from the eurozone, the so-called âGrexitâ, will also have major geostrategic implications. James Stavridis goes as far as arguing that â[i]f Moscow were to assist Athens economically, even marginally, this would further distance Greece from Western Europe. Another likely friend and partner would be Serbia, which has its own troubles with various EU Balkan members. Ultimately, it is not impossible to contemplate Greece departing the European Union or even NATOâ. A similar scenario lies ready for Cyprus."
