        "text": "Key Points\n\nGovernments around the world have different levels of governance.\n\nThe type and authority regional and local governments often reflects the pressures of communities, especially those that are historically or culturally distinct.\n\nThe European Union is an example of supranational governance that seeks to benefit from cooperation and coordination of many independent countries.\n\nGovernments are multi-level. The town of Chapel Hill is within Orange County, one of a hundred counties in North Carolina, which is in turn one of fifty American states. These different levels of government have separate competencies. The town of Chapel Hill is responsible for garbage collection and urban planning, while the county sets property tax rates and coordinates between towns. North Carolina has the authority to make decisions about schooling, health and safety codes, and sets an income tax for residents. Meanwhile, the US government makes agreements with other countries on trade and climate change and sets national policies for infrastructure, environmental protection, and interstate commerce, to name a few. In some areas, different levels share authority. The United States Department of Education can set rules and guidelines for school curricula and colleges, but states also have control for funding and organizing public education.\n\nEach level of government provides public goods in a way that attempts to take advantage of economies of scale, which means it is more efficient for some levels of government to provide services than it is for others. For example, it would be inefficient for each state to have different trade policies, because trade policies like import tariffs have spillover effects on other states. If this were the case, companies seeking to export to North and South Carolina would potentially have to navigate up to fifty different policies. It is more efficient for a higher level of government, like the state or nation, to set trade policies. These efficiency gains from having common policies tend to support the centralization of government authority at higher levels.\n\nThere is a force that pushes back on the tendency to centralize, and that is the need for governments to respond to the fact that people are different across sub-units, like states and towns. Chapel Hill and Charlotte may have different visions for urban planning; one is a small college town and the other is an economic and political hub for the region. At a larger level, European countries have different histories and subpopulations (like indigenous people, linguistic and regional differences) to which governments must respond by granting autonomy over cultural issues and education policy.\n\nRarely is the authority for policymaking delegated to a level above the national government. Individual countries may seek trade agreements with one or several countries (i.e. NAFTA), join defense alliances like NATO, or may join international bodies with specific policy focuses like the World Health Organization, which has sought to combat deadly global pandemics. But each of these organizations rests on the voluntary cooperation of all partners. The EU is different. In recognizing that working together as a group of 27 nations supports economic growth and political stability for all members, these member states have agreed to give up, authority to the European Union in almost every policy area, though to different degrees. In areas related to the single market, the EU holds almost all control, and has some, if lower level of authority in other areas. Member states retain larger amounts of control over key policy areas like citizenship, immigration, and defense, each of which is a nod to the different preferences countries have over these issues. In short, that government is multi-level reflects the fact that there are benefits of scale that can be reaped only with centralization, while differences between communities nudge policymaking to a lower level of government.\n\nUNC – Chapel Hill Profs. Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks explain in this clip how this perspective on multi-level governance applies to the European Union.\n\nKey Points\n\nIn some ways, the EU is like a country; it can make laws and has a single currency, but is weaker than most countries.\n\nThe European Union is the world’s first and only supranational organization.\n\nThe European Union is an organization like no other. It is the world’s only supranational organization, which means that power and authority in certain policy areas is permanently given up by member states to a higher level, the EU. In some policy areas, the EU is the sole body able to make decisions for the 27-member organization, while in other areas, member states retain authority (we discuss which policy areas in the previous section). In most policy areas, authority over policymaking rests partly with the EU and partly with the member states. This makes the EU seem like a country and not like a country at the same time.\n\nThe EU is like a country The EU is not like a country\n\nMost EU Member States have adopted a single currency, the Euro “€”, just as the US has a single currency, the dollar.\n\nThe EU consists of Member States, such as Italy and Poland, which have their own constitutions or similar founding documents, as well as their own autonomous governments.\n\nLegislation passed by EU institutions is binding on members and can be enforced in courts.\n\nThe EU cannot collect taxes from citizens.\n\nThe EU has an anthem and a flag, like many countries.\n\nThe EU is based on a set of treaties between Member States, rather than on a constitution (although one is under discussion).\n\nEuropean citizens directly elect the European Parliament. However, the EP is much weaker than the US Congress, as it cannot propose legislation.\n\nThe EU does not have its own military force or a common foreign policy (although both are under discussion).\n\nBefore we discuss the term supranationalism in depth, it’s important to know what distinguishes it from other forms of governance. The EU began as a series of agreements between partner countries in the form of the European Coal and Steel Community. An international organization, by contrast, usually involves voluntary agreements between governments on particular issue areas, like trade or climate change, but the signatories remain independent. Importantly, decisions by international organizations are not enforceable, and rely on the voluntary cooperation of partners.\n\nIn some ways, the European Union is itself like a country. The EU has the authority to make trade deals (individual member states do not). Because of the single market for goods, services, people (labor), and money, there are no internal borders between EU nations. In other ways, the EU is like an international organization that facilitates communication and collaboration between 27 sovereign countries. For example, each member states still gets to define who is eligible to become a citizen of a given country, even if conferring citizenship also grants that person European Union citizenship.\n\nIs the EU a confederation? A confederation is “a system of government or administration in which two or more distinct political units keep their separate identity but transfer specified powers to a higher authority for reasons of convenience, mutual security, or efficiency” (Ex: The United States after the Revolutionary War during period of Articles of Confederation). In this case the subnational units control the central government, which is given only specific powers. It is similar to an intergovernmental organization, in that the member states retain their autonomy and can control the central government.\n\nOr is the EU a federation, like the United States is? A federation is “a system of government in which significant governmental powers are divided and shared between the central government and small subnational units.” In this view, where EU member states (Lithuania, Italy, etc.) are the equivalent to American states, like Texas or Idaho.\n\nThe EU shares commonalities with confederations and federations, but ultimately is different. Although the EU originally derived its authority from the member states, that authority is permanently granted to the EU and cannot be easily taken back, even though the member states remain autonomous and have significant power.\n\nThe EU is what is called a supranational organization, and is the only one of its kind in the world today. Supranational: A supranational organization is different because member states surrender power in specific areas to the higher organization. Decisions on product standards and trade policy, for example, rest solely with the EU – although the national governments have a seat at the table in the legislative process and through their representation in the European Parliament, national parliaments and governments alone do not have the ability to legislate on that issue. Moreover, decisions taken by a supranational organization must be obeyed by all the member states. There is a system of European courts to determine when violations have occurred. But because the EU does not have complete authority over member states, enforcement mechanisms are often not as effective as they would be within nation states. For example, the actions taken by Hungary and Poland in recent years that undermine democracy by silencing press or sidelining political opposition movements have been difficult for the EU to sanction.\n\nOver time, the EU has become more supranational and less intergovernmental. While the forerunners to the EU (the ECSC and the EEC), they relied on intergovernmental agreements more than they gave power to the institutions within these organizations. But cooperation grew, especially as it pertained to the single market, the intergovernmental Council has lost some power to the Commission and Parliament, the two supranational institutions that cannot be controlled by the individual member states. More policy areas, as the graph below shows, have come under European jurisdiction over time. Policymaking over most areas comes from a mix of the EU and national jurisdiction, and there are almost no areas of governance in which the national governments retain exclusive authority.\n\nThe structure of the European Union is continually contested. This fundamental question about WHAT the EU is responsible for some of the most pressing European questions of our time. Should the EU issue debt on behalf of all 27 countries, and should the EU have a fiscal union in the event of another economic collapse? Should the EU have a common defense force and immigration policy? Some think it should move towards becoming a federation; others think that further integration should be viewed with caution. For example, the German position has generally favored movement toward a federal EU, while the British were reluctant to cede more power to the EU and favor an intergovernmental EU (and they’ve recently left it).\n\nIn this clip, UNC Profs. Gary Marks and Liesbet Hooghe explain how the EU works:\n\nKey Points\n\nThe EU has an executive body, the Commission, and two legislative bodies, the Council and Parliament.\n\nThe European court system adjudicates cases about human rights and European integration.\n\nThe only directly elected body, the European Parlaiment, has gained power over time, even though it is still weaker than most national legislative bodies.\n\nEuropean legislation is passed with the help of three key actors: the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, and the European Parliament. One – the Council – is intergovernmental, a meeting of member state national governments, and two – the European Parliament and Commission – are supranational and independent of the national governments. In the ordinary legislative procedure, the Commission (via the Parliament or Council) proposes legislation, which the Council and the Parliament must later adopt.\n\nThe European Commission is the EU’s independent, executive arm. The commission is led by 28 “commissioners” one from each country, in charge of different policy areas. It proposes legislation, it manages EU policies and allocates EU funding, and it enforces EU law (together with the European Court of Justice), ensuring it is properly applied in all EU countries. Through its arm, the European External Action Service, it represents the EU internationally in areas of trade policy, humanitarian aid, and negotiates international agreements for the EU.\n\nThe Council of the European Union is an intergovernmental element of the EU. It is a meeting of one representative from each member state national for each policy area – so while each country always has one representative, that representative is sometimes the Interior Minister, sometimes the Agriculture Minister, and so on, depending on what legislative issues are at hand. The Council shares legislatie and budgetary powers with the Parliament as a co-legislator.\n\nIn response to the fact that the development of the EU had largely occurred without the consent of European citizens, the EU gained a directly voted legislative body in 1979, when the first European Parliamentary elections were held to the 751-body chamber. This parliament functions as a co-legislator with the Council, which is akin to a cabinet, with one Commissioner for each policy area. It is weaker than national parliaments in that it cannot directly propose legislation, but it has grown in power over time. Since the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission President, now Ursula von der Leyen, is directly elected from by the European Parliament. European Parliamentary elections are held every five years, with the next elections in 2024 and 2029.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe Schengen Agreement removed border controls between many European countries. Moving between countries is almost like crossing U.S. state borders.\n\nThe European Single Market removed all barriers to trade between EU countries. As a whole, the single market is one of the largest economies in the world.\n\nThe Schengen Agreement\n\nThe proximity of European countries and cultures to one another has important implications for peoples’ lives. Thanks to the European Union, those living in the EU have the right to work and live in any other European Union country. Some people living close to borders might even live in one country and work in another.\n\nFor many people living in the EU member states, crossing national borders is very easy, thanks to the Schengen Agreement. This treaty, which was signed in 1985, essentially removed national borders within signatory nations, and allows for passport-free travel between countries. In many cases, your only indicator you are in a new country is a sign on the side of the road and a message from your cell phone carrier that you are on a new network. Importantly, not all EU states are signatories, and some non-EU countries have signed on to the treaty, like Switzerland and Norway. As of December 2020 there are several opt-outs. Ireland has a permanent opt-out. Newer EU states like Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia, each of which commit to eventually joining the agreement.\n\nThe Single Market\n\nBringing together European economies has brought about several key changes to European social and economic life. First, the forerunners to the EU had economic integration as a primary goal, the key to which was harmonizing trade rules across different countries. This was achieved initially through a customs union in the 1960s, which meant European countries charged the same tariff to all goods entering the group, regardless of which country is entered into. It also eliminated border checks for goods moving between countries in the group. This economic integration was deepened with the creation of the European Single Market that came into force thanks to the Maastricht Treaty, which also created the European Union. The single market, as the graphic below explains, includes the features of the customs union, but also includes provisions for common regulations of goods and services and the freedom of movement of people, goods, and money between countries that are members of the single market. This is not to be understated in its significance. It means that there are no internal barriers to trade (ie. tariffs or duties) within the EU, there are common product regulations within the EU. Once products are in the EU, they can move freely within it. Therefore, there is no “German” or “Swedish” border for goods – there is only an EU border.\n\nThe single market relies on significant coordination between countries to ensure product standards and levying of tariffs when they arrive in the EU, even if they are destined to move quickly across national borders. Therefore, countries have lost the authority to set things like product standards and regulations and import/export policies. Instead, this authority now rests within the Euroepan institutions: the Parliament, Commission, and Council. They are the only power with the authority to set product regulations and negotiate trade deals with non-EU countries. This has led to significant harmonization of standards and regulations across Europe, which is beneficial to citizens and businesses alike. This delegation of authority by individual member states to the European level of policymaking is perhaps the prime example of supranationalism.\n\nThe single market has been highly beneficial for all European economies, as it allows countries to sell their products much more cheaply to massive market of over 500 million people. As a bloc, the EU is the second largest economy in the world after the US. The has significantly stabilized economic exchange within the EU, and also between the EU and non-EU countries. This economic integration is so beneficial that even non-EU members often abide by the rules the EU sets of the single market in order to be a part of it (for example, Norway, Switzerland, and likely the U.K. once it formally leaves).\n\nThis single market has had several spillover effects to different areas of governance. It has come along with the four freedoms of the European Union: freedom of movement of goods, services, people, and money. It has been the driver for further economic integration, which has come in the form of the European currency, the euro, which every new member must commit to eventually adopting when they join the EU. In order to help countries benefit the most from the single market, the European Union provides regional development funds to less developed regions for infrastructure and economic development (see next section). It has granted European citizenship to all citizens of member states, allowing them to live freely across the EU.\n\nKey Points\n\nA major goal of the EU is to harmonize infrastructure and communication systems around Europe.\n\nThis harmonization helps the single market function more efficiently and effectively.\n\nCheaper Communication Across Europe\n\nOne major benefit to travelers within the European Union has been the harmonization of communications pricing across Europe. In keeping with the idea that the EU is a single market for all goods and services, the EU has set forth rules on how cell phone companies can charge for calls, texts, and data across EU borders. Since 2017, all calls, texts, and data are charged at the same rate by your carrier regardless of whether or not you are in the carrier’s home country. For example, if you have a Lithuanian SIM card, you are charged domestic prices even if you are in Spain and calling a Spanish number. Moreover, the EU has also set price limits on how much calls, texts, and data may be charged.\n\nRegional Development Funds\n\nThe single market for goods and services functions better if all parts of Europe are able to compete in a global marketplace. In order to level the playing field for less developed parts of Europe, the EU has since the 1970s provided “Regional Development Funds” for infrastructure and economic development to many European regions. Funds are used to help them achieve ‘convergence’ with the economically prosperous parts of Europe. Funding can go towards developing new infrastructure, like high speed rail and highways, creating new knowledge and innovation centers, and promoting cross-European trade. As you can see in the map below, in the older cycle of funding, many regions even within rich countries were eligible for funding. If you ever see construction projects around Spain and Italy, for example the construction of high speed rail projects, you might note a European flag on a poster, which means funding was partially provided by the European Union.\n\nKey Points\n\nMany European Union countries gave up their own currencies and have adopted a common, European currency.\n\nEach country has different engravings on Euro coins.\n\nThis currency union, known as the Eurozone, faced its first major test as a result of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe single market was designed in order to facilitate easier economic integration through trade among European Union countries. But one issue with the single market was that despite barrier-free trade, citizens and businesses still had to deal with over a dozen currencies to exchange. This becomes complicated if supply chains span more than two countries. It is potentially ruinous if one country’s currency were to suddenly increase or decrease in value, which would mean unexpected increases in the cost of imports or exports. Multiply that by thousands of units produced, and those costs might make a business hesitant to invest across borders. Having a common currency solves this issue, because it means there will always be a 1:1 conversion between most countries in the Eurozone. One Euro in Slovakia will be one Euro in Portugal, and all over the EU.\n\nThe Euro became a reality for many Europeans in 2002, but the groundwork for the single currency was decades old, dating back to the founding days of the European Communities. The Maastricht Treaty contained a plan to merge European currencies within a decade. Before countries could adopt a single currency, they had to align their monetary policy (the supply of money) and their exchange rates to avoid large differences between countries. Countries joining the Euro had to accept rules about the size of their debt and deficits, known as the Growth and Stability Pact. When the Euro was introduced virtually in 1999, the European Central Bank took over control of the monetary policy, and today still controls the monetary policy of the Eurozone countries. This is another piece of sovereignty Eurozone countries have given up – the ability to control their own monetary policy – in return they have received exchange rate stability and increase ease of trade. The Euro was introduced to the public in 2002, with fixed changed rates from previous national currencies to the euro.\n\nThe coins and bills carry different motifs. The bills have fictitious bridges on them, while the coins have country-specific designs. The Brandenburg Gate or German eagle, for example, are on the backs of German euro coins. In Italy, the euro coins feature famous Italian artists and monuments, including the Colosseum (in Rome) and a sketch of a human by Leonardo da Vinci. You can see the designs here.\n\nThe Euro has faced significant challenges since its creation. The financial crisis sparked in 2008 created serious problems for mostly Southern European economies. These economies, particularly Greece, had very high levels of debt that it suddenly was no longer able to pay off. This crisis, which boiled over to Spain, Italy, and Portugal, created uncertainty about the stability and value of the Euro. These countries needed to be bailed out (have this debt removed from their balance books) in order to avoid financial ruin. This crisis exposed a major weakness in the organization of the euro, namely that there is no bail out mechanism and only partial solidarity among European publics. Many Northern European countries and publics were opposed to bailing out what they saw as overspending on the part of Southern European governments. Eventually, the EU was able to create a mechanism to buy the debt owed by various governments through the European Central Bank. In the long term, one proposed solution has been for EU countries to issue debt as a group instead of individual countries, but many northern European countries still object to this further integration.\n\nThis YouTube clip from Vox explains the causes of the Eurozone crisis and discusses ways to avoid a similar crisis in the future."
