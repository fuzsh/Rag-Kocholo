        "text": "But Europe has not always been so urban. Indeed, the past fifty years have seen far-reaching changes to the way the European urban system is organised. During these five recent decades, Europe has effectively shifted from being an industrial and primarily rural continent to one that is urban and metropolitan in nature.\n\nThe continent’s 828 cities accounted for 37% of the population in 1961, growing to 40% in 1981 and remaining constant from there on, until more recent growth in the urban cores. Towns, suburbs, and the neighbouring areas, on the other hand, have consistently increased their population share over these five decades, due mainly to a combination of population moving out of the core cities into wider suburbs and urban regions, and from rural areas into towns. This process of shifts from rural to urban, core city to suburb, and single cities to neighbouring networks of locations has been accompanied by two other more recent trends of re-urbanisation, with substantial revitalisation happening in the cores of Europe’s cities, and metropolitanisation, the formal and informal processes of consolidation of neighbouring cities, suburbs, and towns into combined settlements with shared systems of transport and public services.\n\n1.3 A European system of cities?\n\nThe 28 EU Member States entered the Union at different times and with their own distinctive and settled urban systems and hierarchies. Each country began its journey into Europe with a clear sense of how their cities worked together and what national urban systems underpinned their respective roles.\n\nEU integration has opened up these settled urban systems to external influence in the form of trade expansion, population shifts, new connectivity modes, opportunities for economic specialisation, and cross-border interchange and collaboration. As the EU has evolved, Europe’s cities have adjusted to these new opportunities and positioned themselves within a much more open continental framework of an integrating Europe. As cities responded to new choices, opportunities, and connectivity, their adaptations have created a new phenomenon. There is now a clearly evolving European interdependent and polycentric system of cities, that co-exists with the ongoing national urban systems, which have themselves also become more dynamic as a result.\n\nThis new European system of cities is highly heterogenous, featuring the 28 capital cities alongside a larger range of diverse cities with unique specialisms (e.g. in advanced manufacturing, finance, professional services, creative industries, education, technology, ports and logistics, energy, tourism, health, or culture). Cities such as Munich, Rotterdam, Krakow, Gothenburg, Lyon, Manchester, Basel, Barcelona, Cork, Antwerp, Bologna and Oulu, are not the largest city or the capital city of their national urban system, but within the framework of EU integration they have seized the opportunity to become important specialist players on a European stage.\n\nThe new system also contains new urban conurbations that cross-national borders such as Vienna-Bratislava, Copenhagen-Malmo and Trieste-Ljubljana. There are macro-networks of cities that span historic empires (The Austro-Hungarian network), or geographic connectors such as seas (the Baltic Sea region and the Union for the Mediterranean), rivers (such as the Rhine-Ruhr and Danube regional networks of cities), and mountain ranges (such as the transalpine grouping of cities in Switzerland, France, and Italy).\n\nIncreasingly, there also are connected clusters of cities centred around advanced services, innovation, and creative economies that are bound together by flows of people, labour, capital and ideas. Groupings such as the northwest metropolitan core (Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris, London) that contain and combine more than 70% of advanced transactions in the EU share a common corporate presence, mobile labour forces, and are increasingly serviced by integrated rail systems as well as high density aviation connections. The emerging cluster of Central European capitals (Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Vienna, Bratislava) provides an important opportunity for a powerful cluster of connected cities to host advanced activities, and the increasing cooperation and connectivity between Nordic cities (Oslo, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Malmo, Copenhagen) shows the ambition to foster a combined 10 million-person urban region through complementary specialisation and borrowed scale.\n\nThis new European System of Cities can also be observed to house different types of cities, among others:\n\nWestern European large and capital cities, as points of centrality;\n\nDeindustrialising cities, which have recovered from crisis and reinvented themselves through investment;\n\nMediterranean cities, which have invested in tourism and associated infrastructure and services; and\n\nEastern and Central European cities, which have emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union and invested to adapt to the realities of a modern market economy.\n\nIn Central and Eastern European cities, the service sector is not yet quite as dominant, but many such cities are catching up to their Western European counterparts. Indeed, taken as a group, the growth rate of the service sector in Central and Eastern European cities has been faster than anywhere else over the past decade, reflecting the fast and deep structural change and economic transition that has taken place there in recent years. [17]\n\n2000s onward: Globalisation and integration\n\nThe first decade of the twenty-first century was a period of both stabilisation and integration. New political and economic structures in Eastern and Central Europe underwent a period of stabilisation, whilst the eastern expansion of the EU led to a simultaneous strengthening of the European integration process. The twin processes of European integration and globalisation are together encouraging new continental dynamics in which Europe is reliant on the established headquarter strengths of London and Paris to act as the gateways for business, investment and tourism. [18]\n\nAs transport and communication costs have declined, it has become increasingly feasible to divide industry into different phases and to locate these different phases in different places. [19] This in turn has led to increased intra-industry trade between economies at different levels of development. As a result, in the twenty-first century, simple or clear distinctions between economies based on the industries they contain have been replaced by more subtle and hard-to-measure patterns of economic difference and connection. [20]\n\n2.3 Spatial trends 1970s-2000s\n\nFrom the 1970s to 2000, European urban development gave rise to a series of distinct spatial trends with far-reaching implications for the continent’s system of cities. These trends can be grouped into three categories:\n\nSovietisation and de-Sovietisation of Central and Eastern Europe;\n\nDeindustrialisation, the rise of the service economy and intensifying inter-regional disparities;\n\nIncreased connectivity and transnational travel and migration, and the emergence of a new tourism and leisure economy.\n\nThis period also saw the impact of far-reaching political changes on the European urban landscape. Spain underwent a transition from dictatorship to democracy, and thirteen of the now EU 28 members transitioned from the Soviet Bloc to fully fledged market economies.\n\nDeindustrialisation and the rise of the service economy\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, many Western European cities began a long process of deindustrialisation. As cities deindustrialised, their manufacturing base declined dramatically. In the 1980s and 1990s, European cities lost on average between 30% and 80% of their manufacturing jobs. In all cases, deindustrialisation worsened intra-city inequality, as job losses were concentrated in the poorest neighbourhoods. But in some cases, deindustrialisation also impacted upon inter-regional disparities. This was particularly the case where industry was concentrated in certain parts of the country, such as in Italy, the United Kingdom or Germany, and where entire city regions deindustrialised at once, such as in the Rhine-Ruhr valley.\n\nThe rise of the service economy from the early 1980s accentuated further the trend towards intensified inter-regional disparities. As the service sector gained traction, transnational corporations increasingly concentrated in certain nodes of the European economy – notably, in large Western European cities such as Paris, London and Brussels.\n\nIn any given country, these new service sector hubs were often not the same cities as those where industry had been most concentrated, which effectively meant that the spatial specificity of these two phenomena – deindustrialisation and the rise of the service economy – worked together to increase disparities between cities. In the German context, this manifested itself in more intense urban specialisation, and a clearer division of labour between its major cities – particularly between Frankfurt, which became the financial centre, and Berlin, which was still in the throes of socialism.\n\nBut deindustrialisation also affected Central and Eastern European socialist countries. As the Soviet economy grew increasingly complex throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures and factory inputs. As the number of enterprises, trusts and ministries multiplied, the economy began to stagnate and was increasingly sluggish in response to change or in providing incentives to improve growth. [21] Increasingly, citizens migrated from smaller cities to larger, capital cities, accentuating the process of decline. Deindustrialisation in these cities increased further following the collapse of the Soviet system in the early 1990s, as their economies had to rapidly adapt to the reality of the ever more influential post-industrial, service-oriented model.\n\nIncreasing connectivity\n\nThe period from the 1970s to 2000 also saw huge increases in transport connectivity, as Europe embarked on a long quest to build motorways, extend train networks, and improve aviation services. By the early 1980s, the beginnings of mass aviation, together with an increasing number of trans-border highways and railways, had resulted in an explosive growth in cross-border shopping and commuting, particularly in regions such as France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. As a result, the significance of national borders began to break down. Railways experienced a particularly rapid phase of expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s (figure 15).\n\n2.4 Policy trends\n\nCoupled with these demographic and economic trends are a series of distinct policy trends. Indeed, since 1970, cities have implemented a number of different policies to respond to socioeconomic change (see table, below).\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, European urban policy focused primarily on correcting the ills that had come to define inner cities and remote districts in the wake of deindustrialisation, particularly in Western Europe. In the 1970s, this begun with land reclamation and environmental upgrading, as cities begun to turn polluted and semi-abandoned urban landscapes into usable and attractive assets. This was coupled with a focus on jobs, enterprise and skills, as cities increasingly prioritised locally targeted skill-building and support programmes to help former manufacturing workers and a new generation of marginalised youth into new jobs based around the service sector.\n\nIn the 1980s, policy shifted slightly to focus more concretely on achieving large-scale inner-city regeneration. Cities began to implement large-scale neighbourhood renewal schemes that targeted the relatively recent large housing estates and older and decaying inner-city neighbourhoods that had been damaged by the deindustrialisation process. [32] Cities also increasingly worked hard to rebuild a sense of place by reinvesting in central squares and civic monuments. New publicly sponsored agencies were created to deliver change in this period.\n\nBy the 1990s, the policy focus had shifted again, this time to focus more on overall city competitiveness. As tourism began to surge, a key focus became attracting tourists and investing in cultural assets. Cities increasingly bid for world sporting events, established world-class museums, and created alluring city centres through pedestrianisation and a focus on the public realm. Residential conditions were improved to attract leading global companies and the creative classes on which they increasingly depended. Transport also began to emerge as a key priority. In the 1990s, the European Commission launched the Trans-European Transport Network as a means to improve connectivity and competitiveness.\n\nBy the 2000s, it became apparent that competitiveness was increasingly dependent on establishing coherent metropolitan-level governance structures. Coordinated metropolitan governance therefore became the order of the day, as cities looked to create new structures, including two-tier metropolitan authorities, new consolidated metropolitan cities, and in some cases combined authorities with directly elected mayors that had responsibility for the entire metropolitan area. Liveability also became a key policy priority in this period, as cities sought to address externalities associated with growth, including congestion, air pollution, and unaffordable housing.\n\nThe current policy period is defined by a focus on specific sectors and agendas. Today, very few European cities can be assured of sizeable economic growth and job creation. This is due both to the sluggish character of global growth and diminished budgets, and widespread risk aversion. This in turn has led to a growing focus on enhancing European city business climates as a tool for economic development. [33] In particular, the focus has been on specific sectors, including smart specialisation and technology and innovation, as a means to carve out new sectors for growth. Resilience and the climate change agenda have also emerged as a key policy priority in this period.\n\n*Trans-European Networks, meaning the modern and efficient infrastructure intended by the EU to underpin free movement of goods, services and people.\n\n3. The evolving European system of cities\n\n3.1 The European system of cities today\n\nThe current European system of cities is highly heterogeneous in nature. Today, Europe’s urban landscape is characterised by more than 1,000 small, medium-sized and large cities, all of which vary in their role and function.\n\nCompared to other parts of the world, many of Europe’s urban regions have a polycentric structure, where multiple towns and cities have overlapping catchment areas and form parts of polycentric conurbations. People live in one area, work in another, and shop in a third. In some cases, these conurbations extend across national borders. [34]\n\nThis interdependent urban system represents an important change from the 1970s, when cities had little interaction with one another and were locked into narrowly defined national urban hierarchies.\n\nThe European urban system as it stands is made up of the following types of cities:\n\nInternational hubs with a pan-European or global influence. These include knowledge hubs, at the forefront of international industry, business and finance; established capitals that are firmly positioned at the top of their national urban hierarchy; and re-invented capitals that have become engines of economic activity for new Member States.\n\nSpecialised poles, which play an important international role in at least some aspects of the urban economy. These include national service hubs, which fulfil key national functions in the service sector; transformation poles, which have an industrial past, but are currently in the process of reinvention; and gateways, or larger cities with dedicated port infrastructure. Other examples of specialised poles include platforms for innovation and multinational activities, centres for research and higher education, and cities that handle large flows of visitors or have a services sector geared towards tourism.\n\nRegional poles, which include deindustrialised cities and satellite towns, along with regional market and regional public service centres. [35]\n\nThere are at present only two truly global cities in Europe with the genuine scale, quality and experience to function as all-round global hubs, London and Paris. Furthermore, unlike other regions, Europe depends very heavily on successful \"middleweight\" metropolitan cities within successful national economies for a significant proportion of its global trade. [36] The EU has 271 metropolitan regions, which, in 2013, accounted for 59% of the population, were responsible for 62% of all employment, and generated 68% of GDP, highlighting their important role as centres of population, economic activity and employment. [37]\n\n3.2 Comparisons with other urban systems\n\nEuropean cities are low-growth and medium density by global standards. Since 1993, the 20 largest metropolitan areas in Europe have achieved annual income growth of 1.6%, less than a quarter of the 6.2% recorded by their counterparts in the emerging world. [38] The median density of European cities is around 3,000 residents per km², which is almost double that of their North American counterparts, but half that of Asian and African cities. [39]\n\nWith the exceptions of London and Paris, large city urbanisation effects have, until very recently, not been the primary economic driver in Europe in the way that they have been elsewhere in the world. Compared to other cities, European city residents are overwhelmingly concentrated in cities with populations between 250,000 and 5 million. Indeed, of the 79 cities in the world with over 5 million inhabitants, only ten are located in Europe. Moreover, only one in seven European city residents lives in such a city, compared to one in four globally. This means that European cities generally have to compete with one another much more on quality than on quantity. [40]\n\nThe relative absence of megacities in Europe’s system of cities is partially a product of the number of different nation-states, each of which has its own urban system and policy priorities. This is one reason that explains why, despite the growth in cross-border trade and exchange, and despite the emergence of an interdependent Europewide system of cities, European urban performance is still very closely tied to national geography. German cities, for example, have by some distance collectively outperformed British cities since 2007, as a result of this quirk. [41]\n\n3.3 The evolution of the European urban system\n\nOver time, economic shifts have led to different sets of cities succeeding, and to different ways of viewing the European system of cities.\n\nThe back story: European cities from 1945 to the 1970s\n\nDuring the thirty years following the end of the Second World War, European economies transformed almost beyond recognition. [42] Western Europe in particular experienced a so-called “Golden Age” of economic growth from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, during which the average rate of real GDP per capita stood at just over 4% per year, and total GDP per capita nearly doubled. [43]\n\nInitially, the European economy grew rapidly, simply through repairing wartime damage, rebuilding capital stocks, and redeploying men drafted into the war effort to productive, output-creating industries. Indeed, the rapid economic expansion of the early post-war years can be described as a process of “catch-up growth,” in which the continent was able to sustain growth primarily by exploiting the backlog of new technologies that had been developed between the two world wars but that had not yet been put to any commercial use. [44]\n\nEven in these early years, however, growth was uneven across the continent, which in turn led to the emergence of a distinct post-war industrial economic geography. This geography reflected a number of distinct characteristics operating at a variety of different scales, including proximity to markets, raw materials and cheap labour sources, pre-war industrial specialisations, and the new post-war European geopolitical order.\n\nAt a national level, catch-up growth tended to be strongest where there were solidaristic trade unions, cohesive employers’ associations, and growth-minded governments. [45] Moreover, industrial growth prevailed in the six countries that joined the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and later set up the European Economic Community – Germany, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries – and in countries receiving U.S. support, including Marshall Plan aid.\n\n4. How the system of cities evolved: adaptation and investment in European cities\n\n4.1 Cycles of development and investment in Europe’s cities.\n\nHow, then, have European cities managed to bounce back from demographic and economic decline? And what was it that enabled them to break free of national hierarchies and re-organise themselves into a new system based around concentrated clusters and flows?\n\nThe answer to these questions, at least in part, lies with investment. European cities initially used investment to encourage growth and reverse city-centre decline. Later, investment was directed towards regional specialisms and new industries, such as technology and innovation. This helped to establish the current system.\n\nThe first cycle of European urban investment: 1980s – 2000s\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, cities invested in large-scale regeneration programmes as a means of encouraging city-centre growth. In many instances, cities leveraged their immense but dilapidated civic assets, including town halls, public libraries, universities, parks and public squares, to redevelop their heritage and culture. [57]\n\nOld civic buildings were restored, industrial properties reused, and popular pedestrian zones created. Cities also actively supported the start-up of new service businesses through the provision of incubator spaces and the repurposing of old and abandoned sites. This, in turn, generated a new economic climate that favoured the private sector and created new jobs. Consequently, the physical environment improved, residents moved back to the city centre, reversing the decades-long decline. [58]\n\nGovernment leadership was essential, providing funding support for the transformation of physical assets, as well as the resources for large-scale recovery programmes. [59] However, one of the main reasons that urban regeneration was so successful was that it attracted into city governments skills from the private sector to help make the investment a reality. [60] Without private sector support, many of the far-reaching transformations that characterised the 1980s and 1990s – including Barcelona, the London Docklands, and the Manchester central business district – would not have been possible.\n\nCities also invested heavily in transport infrastructure. Major upgrading of public transport systems aimed at overcoming the dominance of traffic and the continued expansion of roads. It also aimed at unlocking new districts, increasing productivity and improving air quality. Over the past few decades, European cities have invested primarily in improving the coordination of public transport services. The first fully integrated public transport system was the Verkehrsverbund, established in Hamburg in 1967. Between 1970 and 2000 most large cities developed similar systems, with coordinated services and fares. [61]\n\nBut cities have also invested in modernising and expanding their public transport services. Modern equipment replaced almost all rolling stock, and new stations, tracks and guidance systems expanded and modernised rail infrastructure. Improvements in the quantity and quality of public transport services, together with low fares, have led to considerable growth in public transport use in European cities over the past few decades, particularly in western EU cities: a 39% increase in passenger kilometres for metro and tram, 38% for rail, and 11% for bus. [62]\n\nThe second cycle of European urban investment: 2000s-\n\nSince the 2000s, cities have also invested in technology and innovation to enhance competitiveness. One of the thematic objectives of EU Cohesion Policy during the 2014-2020 period is to enhance access to, and the use and quality of information and communications technology, including developing products and services and strengthening applications. The EU eGovernment Action Plan (2016-2020) currently sets out concrete actions to accelerate the implementation of existing legislation and the related uptake of online services. [63]\n\nInvestment is also increasingly directed towards the climate action and environmental agenda. For several decades, cities were seen as environmental problems, and urban policies throughout Europe focused primarily on poverty, crime, and urban decay. Recently, climate change and the environment rapidly climbed the urban agenda, as European governments started to set tougher and more ambitious targets. COP21, the UN Conference of Parties climate meeting in Paris in 2015, was a key milestone, demonstrating the widespread recognition of cities as global solutions. [64]\n\nOver the past decade, cities have come to occupy a central role in the global response to climate change. Several cities, investing in their industrial and engineering expertise, have become pioneers of new environmental industries. Many cities, including Stockholm, Berlin and London, have also begun to decouple economic prosperity from increasing levels of resource consumption, in what is increasingly seen as a fundamental component of a sustainable European urban future. [65]\n\nThe European Commission is particularly committed to putting in place the necessary reforms to give incentives to the financial sector to contribute to this “green transition”. The Investment Plan for Europe – the Juncker Plan – has already generated considerable investment and has mobilised several other sources of European financing, including the structural funds, to fund numerous projects in the fields of energy efficiency, renewable energies and the circular economy. [66]\n\n4.2 Financing Europe’s cities.\n\nWhere has the funding come from?\n\nBoth national governments and cities have an important role to play. On one hand, attracting external capital investment is not yet a core responsibility of all city governments and there are gaps in the competencies, capacity and skills of city governments to undertake such tasks. In Europe, city governments do not generally have the same degree of fiscal and financial freedom as cities in North America. Even cities in more devolved national systems do not have the capacity to single-handedly meet all of their investment needs. [67] On the other hand, national governments have committed themselves to external fiscal disciplines (such as the Stability Pact/Maastricht Principles for Euro membership), which means they cannot easily raise the rate of public investment through public debt.\n\nIn Europe, municipalities mainly resort to their own resources to finance infrastructure investment, which accounts for 50% of financing. This is followed by transfers from national and sub-national governments (23%), external finance including bank loans (18%), and EU funding, including EU structural funds (8%). [68]\n\nTrends in European urban investment\n\nIt is increasingly recognised that achieving EU policy goals is only possible if Europe’s cities are fully engaged in attaining their own long-term success. To achieve this, development and investment requirements must be met. This imperative has resulted in a notable trend towards the private sector becoming more involved in investment.\n\nIn most cases of successful city investment over the past five decades, public and private capital have played complementary roles. It has gradually become clear that private investment is essential to bridge the numerical gap in financing, as well as to add market discipline, raise the quality of the deliverable, and demonstrate to investors that the city is attractive. [69]\n\nThe “investment gap”\n\nOver the past five years, 42% of EU municipalities have reported an increase in investment activity. [70] But although cities are attracting investment effectively—and in a way that generates both a reasonable internal and external rate of return—this does not mean that all European cities have all the investment that they need or would like. Indeed, there is still an “investment gap” in cities throughout Europe.\n\nThis gap, however, is more than just a capital gap. It is also:\n\nAn institutional framework gap – returns on public investments are expected over short timescales, giving rise to shorter pay-back periods that are not always realistic and do not provide the right incentive for large-scale public investment.\n\nA collaboration gap – lack of coordination between different public bodies active in the same cities, plus the fact that PPPs and other methods of investment delivery have not yet evolved to be comprehensively applicable or universally trusted.\n\nA knowledge gap – lack of knowledge among public and private actors about how each other works and what is required for effective collaboration, plus information gaps on available investment opportunities. [71]\n\nNew directions in European urban investment\n\nIn an attempt to overcome this investment gap, several new strategies for better capitalisation have been put forward. In the last ten years in particular, there has been a renewed focus on increasing investment flows. Several key innovations stand out.\n\nFirstly, there has been an increased focus on bankability, meaning that the likelihood of profit is more reliable. Institutions are helping cities to become more bankable by allowing them to develop advanced asset management and corporate finance systems. Partly, this is based on the recognition that different types of cities have different types of investment gaps, and therefore require different strategies. As the European system of cities has become more differentiated, it has also become apparent that different kinds of cities are on distinctive journeys and need investment that supports their distinctive needs. Knowledge hubs, for example, experience different types of investment gaps to research centres, and require different investment strategies to close these gaps. [72]\n\nEmphasis has also been placed on helping cities to develop sound fiscal strategies. This is the first step in building the necessary foundation of trust that will enable cities to promote themselves in such a way as to engender confidence among financiers.\n\nSecondly, different forms of lending are coming to the fore. Aside from traditional bank loans, longer-term, structured financing techniques, such as bond financing, are rapidly gaining in popularity. These new forms of lending have been enabled by the emergence of new lending instruments and tools, such as revolving loans, and guarantees and incentives, which are increasingly used to lower the risks of private investment."
