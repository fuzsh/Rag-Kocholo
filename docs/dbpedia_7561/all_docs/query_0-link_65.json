        "text": "Changes in the Level of Interest Rate in the Euro Area\n\nThe level of interest rates in the euro area following the realization of EMU is perhaps the most evident financial variable through which EMU will affect outside countries. In conjunction with possible changes in expectations about the exchange rate of the euro against other world currencies, any changes in interest rates in the euro area will affect interest-sensitive capital flows between the EMU participants and the CEE countries and selected Mediterranean countries.\n\nThere is, however, considerable uncertainty among analysts about how EMU may actually affect interest rates in the participating countries. Moreover, the discussion on the interest rate implications of EMU is often couched in a wider policy context that takes into account not only the new regime for monetary and exchange rate policies, but also changes in fiscal and structural policies that are only partly related to EMU itself. Thus, while it is often argued that a successful EMU could bring about a decline in interest rates in the euro area, this favorable scenario normally assumes that EMU also serves as a catalyst for accelerating fiscal consolidation and structural reforms (particularly in the labor market). Downward pressure on interest rates results from lower budget deficits and public debts, as well as from the favorable supply-side effects of structural reforms. Furthermore, these factors could allow the European Central Bank (ECB) to pursue a less restrictive monetary policy without compromising its credibility, possibly reducing the anti-inflation bias that some expect the ECB to have in the early years of EMU.\n\nOf course, EMU need not be accompanied by these virtuous fiscal and structural policies, even though fiscal policies will be constrained by the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact. In this regard, the different interest rate implications of two scenarios for EMU and their accompanying fiscal and structural policies were presented in the October 1997 World Economic Outlook. These scenarios are reproduced in Table 2.6.13 Under a first, “successful EMU scenario,” long-term interest rates gradually fall to about half a percentage point below the baseline level by 2003. Under a second, “reform fatigue scenario,” by contrast, interest rates end up about half a percentage point above the baseline level.14\n\nTable 2.6.\n\nEffects in Euro Area of EMU Scenarios Under Different Assumptions Regarding Fiscal and Structural Policies\n\n(Deviations from baseline, in percent, unless otherwise indicated)1\n\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook (October 1997).\n\n1Baseline in the World Economic Outlook of October 1997.

Adherence Co the Stability and Growth Pact is assumed in both scenarios. It is also assumed that all current EU member countries participate in EMU from the start.\n\nWhile the actual behavior of euro-area interest rates will therefore depend significantly on the accompanying fiscal and structural policies, other factors—not necessarily EMU-related—could also come into play. Some of these could tend to make interest rates higher in the first years of EMU. First, interest rates in the euro area are currently at historically low levels. Should the ongoing cyclical recovery of the economies of prospective EMU countries gather momentum, the ECB may have to raise interest rates in the early years of EMU to keep inflationary pressures at bay.15 Second, the ECB could initially show a deflationary bias in order to establish credibility. Third, the introduction of a single currency is expected to reduce transaction costs, enhance total factor productivity, and boost investment demand within the EU.16 This is particularly likely under the favorable scenario, where structural reforms will contribute to productivity improvements, and investors’ “animal spirits” could be positively affected by a climate of growth and optimism. To the extent that EMU promotes investment demand, upward pressure on real interest rates should ensue.\n\nWhatever the effect of EMU on interest rates in the euro area, the impact on outside countries through the capital flow channel will depend on the extent of their international financial integration (discussed below) and on their monetary and exchange rate regimes. In countries that peg their currencies to the euro, or attempt to maintain relatively stable exchange rates against it, domestic interest rates and domestic demand are likely to respond more to changes in euro-area interest rates than they will in countries that maintain relatively flexible exchange rates, where most of the adjustment is likely to take place via changes in the exchange rate.\n\nTable 2.7 illustrates this point by highlighting the results of a survey of IMF country desk economists concerning the possible impact of a change in interest rates in the euro area on growth, the current account, and debt service in the countries under study. The analysis, expressed in terms of estimated deviations from baseline, is based on examining the effect of a 2 percentage point increase (relative to baseline) in short-term interest rates in the euro area in 1999–2000 and a 1 percentage point increase (relative to baseline) in 2001; long-term interest rates partially reflect this increase. In order to concentrate on the impact of interest rate changes, it is assumed that the euro/dollar exchange rate and economic growth within the euro area remain constant, but the analysis takes into account the particular exchange rate regimes that the different CEE countries and selected Mediterranean countries are likely to have in place when EMU is launched.\n\nTable 2.7.\n\nEstimated Effects of an Increase in Euro-Area Interest Rates on CEE Countries and Selected Mediterranean Countries1\n\n(Deviations from baseline)\n\nSource: IMF staff estimates.\n\n1Simple averages of estimated effects on Albania, Bulgaria.

The estimates assume no change in the Euro/dollar exchange rate and no change in the rate of economic growth within the euro area.\n\n2Debt service as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor services.\n\nThe survey suggests that an increase of interest rates in the euro area would, on average, result in some decline in GDP growth, some improvement in the current account, and some deterioration in the debt-service ratio. These results in turn reflect various underlying factors. First, on average, the countries under review experience an increase in their interest rates in response to the increase in euro-area interest rates. Second, on average, the negative impact of higher interest rates on growth (via lower domestic demand) outweighs any possible impact on growth through the depreciation of the domestic currency against the euro (and higher net exports) in countries that have floating exchange rates or adjust their pegs downward. And third, on average, the negative impact on debt service resulting from higher interest payments on euro-denominated foreign debt more than offsets the favorable impact on debt service stemming from an improved current account and foreign debt position.\n\nPortfolio Diversification Effects\n\nWhatever its impact on the average level of interest rates in the euro area, EMU should result in a reduction in interest rate differentials between local-currency-denominated debt issued by participating southern countries and comparable debt issued by core EMU countries. By eliminating exchange rate risk, EMU should make the spreads on local-currency government bonds move in line with those observed on foreign-currency public debt, so that they will reflect only differences in perceived credit risk and, to a lesser extent, differences in liquidity, settlement, and legal risks. In fact, this effect has essentially already taken place over the past two years in Italy, Portugal, and Spain, as these countries have made progress in the areas of Fiscal consolidation and inflation reduction, and as the perceived probability of EMU taking place and including these countries has increased (see Figure 2.2). Long-term yield spreads between domestic-currency-denominated debt issued by these three southern countries and comparable German treasury bonds are now similar to those observed between their foreign-currency-denominated debt and the foreign-currency-denominated debt issued by core EMU countries.\n\nTable 2.8 shows the spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury issues paid by different EU sovereigns on their dollar-denominated debt in recent years. Spain and Italy paid, depending on the maturities, only between 5 and 15 basis points more than the EU country with the lowest spread. This provides a reference for the spreads that are likely to prevail on domestic-currency debt under EMU. The spreads between sovereign issues could, in fact, all but disappear if a country’s participation in EMU increased the perception that it will be bailed out by other member countries, the EU budget, or the ECB in the event of a budgetary crisis. However, the “no bail-out” clause contained in Article 104b of the Maastricht Treaty, the prohibition of ECB financing of EMU governments, and the experience of federal states such as Canada or the United States (where the cost of provincial or state debt bears a close relation to the assigned credit ratings) make this rather unlikely. Thus, some interest rate spreads will probably remain.\n\nTable 2.8.\n\nSpreads on Long-Term U.S. Dollar-Denominated International Bonds1\n\n(In basis points)\n\nSources; Paribas Capital Markets, London; and Bloomberg Financial Markets LR\n\n1Spreads between bonds of 10-year or nearest maturity issued by EU sovereigns and comparable bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.\n\n2Difference between the average spread shown by the country in question in the three months of observation and the average spread shown by the EU country with the lowest spread among those for which data were available.\n\n3Average of September 1996 and June 1997.\n\nTable 2.8.\n\nSpreads on Long-Term U.S. Dollar-Denominated International Bonds1\n\n(In basis points)\n\nSeptember\n\n1996 June\n\n1997 July\n\n1998 Average of\n\nThree Months Difference with\n\nLowest Spread2 Austria 24 23 35 27 2 Belgium 28 26 38 31 6 Denmark 27 26 31 28 3 Finland 30 29 29 29 4 Ireland 25 25 … 253 0 Italy 34 30 40 35 10 Spain 32 30 41 34 9 Sweden 27 28 58 33 13\n\nSources; Paribas Capital Markets, London; and Bloomberg Financial Markets LR\n\n1Spreads between bonds of 10-year or nearest maturity issued by EU sovereigns and comparable bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.\n\n2Difference between the average spread shown by the country in question in the three months of observation and the average spread shown by the EU country with the lowest spread among those for which data were available.\n\n3Average of September 1996 and June 1997.\n\nTable 2.8.\n\nSpreads on Long-Term U.S. Dollar-Denominated International Bonds1\n\n(In basis points)\n\nSeptember\n\n1996 June\n\n1997 July\n\n1998 Average of\n\nThree Months Difference with\n\nLowest Spread2 Austria 24 23 35 27 2 Belgium 28 26 38 31 6 Denmark 27 26 31 28 3 Finland 30 29 29 29 4 Ireland 25 25 … 253 0 Italy 34 30 40 35 10 Spain 32 30 41 34 9 Sweden 27 28 58 33 13\n\nSources; Paribas Capital Markets, London; and Bloomberg Financial Markets LR\n\n1Spreads between bonds of 10-year or nearest maturity issued by EU sovereigns and comparable bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury.\n\n2Difference between the average spread shown by the country in question in the three months of observation and the average spread shown by the EU country with the lowest spread among those for which data were available.\n\n3Average of September 1996 and June 1997.\n\nThe convergence of long-term interest rates in southern EMU countries toward those prevailing in core EMU members could stimulate portfolio capital flows from the EMU area (as well as from other industrial countries) into the CEE countries and Mediterranean countries under consideration, as investors try to maintain the desired diversification of their portfolios between assets with different yield/risk combinations. In this respect, it should be noted that portfolio diversification by institutional investors in industrial countries seems to have been an important driving force behind the surge in private capital flows to developing countries seen in the 1990s. With spreads for potential southern EMU participants having narrowed to unprecedented levels, this effect may have already begun to operate ahead of the launching of Stage III of EMU.\n\nSome of the countries under analysis are particularly well suited to replace the southern EU countries in the portfolios of international investors. This would appear to be the case for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia, all of which offer assets with a higher-yield/higher-but-mode rate-risk combination that broadly resembles those offered until recently by southern EU countries. These are all European countries, have or are expected to have annual inflation rates in the 5–15 percent range by the time EMU is launched, have made substantial progress in the area of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform, have been granted investment-grade credit ratings by the major international rating agencies (discussed in more detail below), have relatively developed stock exchanges, are liberalizing their capital accounts, and enjoy a rather stable political situation and close links with the EU (including the prospect of early accession to the EU).17 In addition, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have recently become members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an important factor since many institutional investors are by law or by their own statutes limited to investing in OECD countries. Thus, these CEE countries seem the most natural substitutes for the southern EMU countries in the portfolios of institutional investors.\n\nOECD membership could also facilitate a portfolio shift toward Turkey, although higher inflation, weaker links with the EU, and higher macroeconomic and political risk make this country a less obvious substitute.18 Israel is neither a European nor an OECD country and may be seen to exhibit higher political risk than the above-mentioned CEE countries. But having an inflation rate in the 5–15 percent range, an open capital account, relatively developed capital markets, and an investment-grade credit rating, it could also benefit significantly from portfolio shifts.\n\nThis “search for higher yields” effect is likely to be reinforced by other EMU-induced portfolio shifts. For example, EMU could lead to a higher degree of synchronization of macroeconomic performance and financial asset price movements between the different EMU countries.19 This would encourage investors to find new opportunities for portfolio diversification outside the euro area, including in the countries under analysis. In addition, EMU (in combination with other factors such as the development within EU countries of parallel, privately managed pension pillars) is expected to lead to an acceleration in the process of securitization that is already being observed in the financial systems of EU countries.20 This will expand the size of the portfolios of institutional investors located in the euro area, and these investors are likely to place part of this increase in their available funds in assets of neighboring non-EU countries. Also, as some CEE countries and Mediterranean countries join the EU and start to approach participation in EMU, the markets may further increase their holdings of bonds denominated in those countries’ currencies under so-called convergence plays, where traders bet that the gap in bond yields between peripheral countries and EMU countries will shrink rapidly. Finally, EMU will ease the constraints imposed by currency-matching requirements on foreign-currency-denominated investments by insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds located in the euro area. These rules aim at limiting the foreign exchange risk associated with having obligations to policyholders or shareholders denominated in local currency while some investments are denominated in foreign currency. With EMU, foreign currency investments made by affected institutions in other EMU currencies will automatically be reclassified as domestic-currency investments, thus increasing the margin available to those institutions for investing in non-euro currencies. Some national (or statutory) regulations define currency-matching requirements in terms of the nationality of the issuer, in which case the requirement would continue to be binding despite EMU.21 Whatever their exact definition, however, matching requirements within the EU are expected to be eased in the context of either the future Pension Funds Directive or a stricter interpretation of the directive of 1998 liberalizing capital movements.22 The OECD is also bringing into the discipline of the Capital Movements Code certain restrictions on portfolio investment abroad by pension funds and insurance companies, which would have the effect of easing constraints on diversification.23\n\nIn sum, EMU is likely to trigger or intensify a number of portfolio effects that, in combination, should contribute significantly to increasing portfolio flows from the EU and other industrial countries into the countries under analysis. Among these countries, those that stand to benefit most from these portfolio shifts are those with relatively open capital accounts and developed domestic securities markets, with a higher degree of macroeconomic and political stability, with relatively low inflation rates (although not as low as in the euro area), with close links with the EU, and that are members of the OECD.\n\nCapital Account Regulations\n\nThe degree of financial integration should be related to capital account regulations to the extent that these regulations are enforced. In examining such regulations, this section emphasizes when relevant any specific rules applied only to flows with prospective EMU participants.27\n\nMost CEE countries lifted the restrictions on FDI inflows (except in a few sensitive or defense-related sectors) at the beginning of their transition to a market economy. They also guaranteed in most cases the free repatriation of both profits (current account convertibility) and FDI capital. FDI inflows were welcomed as a not-easily-reversible source of foreign exchange and because of the usual externalities associated with FDI (introduction of new technologies and managerial skills, access to export networks, and so forth). In addition, FDI was to play a key role both in these countries’ privatization and enterprise restructuring processes and as a source of government revenues. Most CEE countries initially required authorization for FDI outflows, but the authorization was normally granted liberally when the investment was thought to help exports. Since early in the reform process, most CEE countries have also applied a quite liberal treatment to trade credits (in the case of outward trade credits because of their positive effect on exports), and allowed individuals to hold and operate foreign exchange accounts at local banks, a privilege that most industrial countries accorded only at the last stage of liberalization of their capital accounts.28\n\nWith the exception of FDI-related transactions, however, most other capital movements remained very restricted in CEE countries, as these countries feared the potentially destabilizing effects of an open capital account at a time when they were still trying to put their macroeconomic houses in order. In particular, financial credits, portfolio flows, and real estate operations remained severely restricted for years in practically all countries. A general pattern, and one that has endured until today, was the existence (legally and de facto) of much tighter controls on outflows than on inflows and more serious restrictions on short-term than on long-term transactions.29\n\nSince 1995, a number of CEE countries have been gradually easing restrictions on capital movements. This process has been led by the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, all of which have undertaken substantial liberalization commitments as part of their accession to the OECD in December 1995, May 1996, and November 1996, respectively.-30 But other CEE countries have also taken measures in recent years to ease their capital controls.\n\nIn the context of their accession to the OECD, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have liberalized FDI outflows (vis-à-vis OECD countries and countries having signed bilateral investment protection agreements in the case of Hungary and Poland), outward trade credits, and personal capital movements. They have also liberalized other outflows (particularly long-term outflows) to varying degrees. Thus, the Czech Republic has fully liberalized the purchase abroad by residents of any foreign security, as well as Czech investment in real estate abroad, although it continues to require authorization for the admission of foreign securities to its capital and money markets. Hungary has allowed residents to invest in securities of more than one year of original maturity, issued by OECD governments or OECD-based companies with an investment grade rating. Poland has liberalized, for maturities of more than one year, outward financial credits and purchases of securities issued by OECD countries. On the side of inflows, the Foreign Exchange Law passed by the Czech Republic on October 1, 1995, removed the requirement of prior authorization for most inflows, while Poland and Hungary have removed all restrictions on medium- and long-term inflows (maturities of more than one year).31\n\nOverall, these measures have contributed to a substantial liberalization of flows (including portfolio flows) in these three countries, particularly with respect to medium- and long-term flows and on the side of inflows. The acceptance of the OECD Capital Movements Code also implies for these countries the need to comply with its standstill, nondiscrimination, and transparency clauses.32 Finally, the Czech Republic and Hungary have also committed themselves to abolishing all remaining capital controls within three to four years of their dates of OECD membership, if the macroeconomic situation permits, while Poland has committed itself within the OECD to removing all remaining restrictions by end-1999.\n\nAnother institutional process that is having a bearing on the capital account regulations of the countries under analysis is the signing of Association Agreements with the EU and, for a number of countries, the prospect of early accession to the EU. The Europe Agreements concluded between the EU and some CEE countries oblige both parties to liberalize FDI-related flows between themselves. They also encourage CEE countries to take further liberalization measures with the ultimate objective of fully liberalizing flows with the EU. Furthermore, countries joining the EU will have to free capital movements visa-vis all countries from the date of membership, unless they obtain a transitory period for this part of the acquis communautaire:.33 Those countries that started accession negotiations in early 1998 (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia, among the countries considered here), could join the EU as soon as in 2002, meaning that they would in principle have to have a completely open capital account by then. The commitments before the OECD undertaken by Poland to lift all remaining restrictions by end-1999, and by Hungary and the Czech Republic to do so within three to four years, therefore, are consistent with their prospect of EU membership.\n\nBox 2.1.\n\nEmpirical Tests of International Financial Integration for Mediterranean Countries\n\nA number of empirical tests of financial openness have been conducted in the literature, based, for example, on interest parity conditions, saving and investment correlations, or correlations of consumption levels across countries.1 In the case of the CEE countries, however, empirical tests of financial openness are generally not available, reflecting the lack of appropriate national account statistics or sufficiently long time series, and the econometric difficulties in dealing with rapid structural change. For the four Mediterranean countries under analysis, a number of formal estimates have been produced in the context of more general tests for developing countries.\n\nAn important finding of the empirical tests of capital mobility in developing countries performed in the 1980s and early 1990s was that these countries are more financially open than had been assumed (see Montiel, 1993). This conclusion was reached even though most of these studies were done before the surge in private capital inflows experienced by a number of developing countries in the 1990s. Available empirical estimates for Cyprus, Israel, Malta, and Turkey, shown in the table, are in line with the main conclusions of this literature. They generally tend to classify Israel as a country with a relatively high degree of international financial integration, and the other three countries as having an intermediate-to-high degree of financial openness.\n\nHaque and Montiel (1990), using the methodology proposed in Edwards and Khan (1985) to test the uncovered interest parity condition, concluded that during the period 1969–87 both Malta and Turkey showed intermediate degrees of international financial integration. Montiel (1989) and Dowla and Chowdhury (1991) tested for the hypothesis of monetary autonomy in a number of developing countries. The idea behind these two studies was that, with perfect international capital mobility and fixed exchange rates, the domestic credit or money supply should not cause, in the Granger sense, movements in nominal income. Using annual data for the period 1962–86, Montiel rejected the hypothesis that these domestic financial aggregates Granger-caused nominal income in Turkey, implying a relatively high degree of financial openness in this country. Dowla and Chowdhury reached a similar conclusion for Israel, using quarterly data for the period 1957–89.\n\nMontiel (1993) performed a number of tests of financial openness with data for several developing countries, including the computation of gross capital inflows and outflows as a percentage of GDP, Feldstein-Ho-rioka type of saving and investment correlations, tests of uncovered interest parity, and correlations of national and world consumption. The data covered, depending on the test and the country, different subsets of years within the period 1960–90. Montiel concluded that the degree of financial integration was high in Israel and intermediate in Cyprus and Turkey. Among the tests performed by Montiel (1993), those that distinguished different subperiods detected an increase in financial integration over time in Cyprus and Israel, but not in Turkey. For Malta, the results were inconclusive.\n\nMamingi (1993) estimated saving and investment correlations for 58 developing countries over the period 1970–90. He concluded that Turkey had an intermediate and Malta an intermediate-to-high degree of capital mobility. Finally, Obstfeld (1994) tested for the correlation of national consumption with world consumption in a sample of industrial and developing countries including Cyprus and Turkey for the periods 1951–72 and 1973–88. Cyprus was found to have in the second period the highest correlation among the developing countries included in the sample, with the coefficient of correlation (0.64) close to the highest coefficients obtained by industrial countries, implying a relatively high degree of international financial integration.2 The coefficient also increased between the two periods, consistent with the findings by Montiel (1993). For Turkey, by contrast, the coefficient of correlation was very low and (also consistent with Montiel’s results) slightly declining.\n\nResults of Empirical Tests of International Financial Integration in Mediterranean Countries\n\n1Combines degree of access to international capital markers total private capital inflows/GDR and a measure of the level of diversification of the country’s financing.\n\n2For the period 1992–94.\n\nResults of Empirical Tests of International Financial Integration in Mediterranean Countries\n\nFindings on Financial Integration Study Type of Test Cyprus Israel Malta Turkey Haqueand Montiel (1991) Uncovered interest parity Intermediate Intermediate Montiel (1989) Monetary autonomy test High Dowla and Chowdhury (1991) Monetary autonomy test High Montiel (1993) Gross capital flows: saving-investment correlations: uncovered interest parity: correlation of domestic and world consumption Intermediate and growing High and growing Inconclusive Intermediate and stable Mamingi (1993) Saving-investment Correlations Intermediate to high Intermediate Obstfeld (1994) Correlation of domestic and world consumption High and growing Low and slightly declining World Bank (l997a) Composite index of financial integration1 High and growing2\n\n1Combines degree of access to international capital markers total private capital inflows/GDR and a measure of the level of diversification of the country’s financing.\n\n2For the period 1992–94.\n\nResults of Empirical Tests of International Financial Integration in Mediterranean Countries\n\nFindings on Financial Integration Study Type of Test Cyprus Israel Malta Turkey Haqueand Montiel (1991) Uncovered interest parity Intermediate Intermediate Montiel (1989) Monetary autonomy test High Dowla and Chowdhury (1991) Monetary autonomy test High Montiel (1993) Gross capital flows: saving-investment correlations: uncovered interest parity: correlation of domestic and world consumption Intermediate and growing High and growing Inconclusive Intermediate and stable Mamingi (1993) Saving-investment Correlations Intermediate to high Intermediate Obstfeld (1994) Correlation of domestic and world consumption High and growing Low and slightly declining World Bank (l997a) Composite index of financial integration1 High and growing2\n\n1Combines degree of access to international capital markers total private capital inflows/GDR and a measure of the level of diversification of the country’s financing.\n\n2For the period 1992–94.\n\nNot too much emphasis should be put on the suggestion in these studies that international financial integration in Turkey may have actually declined during the 1970s and 1980s. Apart from the general caution with which all the results of these tests should be interpreted, these tests do not cover, as noted, the surge in private capital flows to developing countries of the 1990s, of which Turkey has been an important beneficiary (see below). In this respect, a study recently published by the World Bank, which classified a sample of 65 developing countries according to their degree of financial integration using data up to 1994, concluded that Turkey had moved from an intermediate level of integration in 1985–87 to a high level in 1992–94.3\n\n1 For a discussion of different approaches to measuring international financial integration, see Goldstein and Mussa f 1993), Montiel (1993). and Obstfeld (1994). For a survey of the growing body of literature applying these techniques to developing countries, see Montiel (1993). 2 A coefficient of 1 implies, under certain assumptions, perfect capital mobility. 3 See World Bank (1997a). The World Bank constructed an overall index of financial integration by combining a measure of access to the international capital markets, a measure of a country’s ability to attract private capital inflows (based on total gross inflows over GDP but adjusted to weight more heavily flows other than FDI), and a measure of the level of diversification of a country’s financing (with higher diversification reflecting higher integration). Interestingly, the World Bank calculations showed Hungary, the only CEE country included in the sample, moving from the group of developing countries with low integration in 1985–87 to the group of highly integrated countries in 1992–94.\n\nMeasures in the area of capital account liberalization are also contained in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement signed in 1995 between Israel and the EU, though not in the Association Agreements concluded by the EU with Cyprus, Malta, and Turkey. Among these Mediterranean countries, the liberalization efforts are currently being led by Israel, which has already achieved a relatively high degree of capital account openness and has announced its intention to do away with virtually all remaining restrictions in 1998, Turkey undertook a substantial liberalization of its capital account during the 1980s and first half of the 1990s, partly reflecting its obligations as a member of the OECD, Cyprus, for its part, has taken steps in recent years to liberalize its capital account and plans to take further measures in the coming years, in preparation for its integration into the EU.34\n\n(Table 2.9) provides a summary description of existing controls on selected capital flows in the countries under analysis. It focuses on FDI, real estate, and portfolio and credit flows not involving the domestic banking system, thus leaving aside the specific provisions affecting banks and other financial institutions, the investment restrictions affecting institutional investors, and the regulations determining the capacity of residents and nonresidents to hold and operate foreign- and domestic-currency-denominated accounts. While some of the regulations excluded from the analysis are admittedly important, they are often too complex to be characterized in a simple way, and the overall degree of liberalization of the capital account might reasonably be expected to show a high degree of correlation with the overall degree of liberalization of the capital flows included in Table 2.9. An index of liberalization of these selected flows was calculated as a proxy for the overall degree of capital account openness; it is also reported as a memorandum item in table 2.9.\n\nThis index can take values between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the maximum degree of liberalization. It shows that the Czech Republic, with an index of 74 percent, was, by a substantial margin, the country that had as of early 1997 made the most progress in opening its capital account, followed, in order, by Israel, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey (all with indices in the 50–62 percent range). Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, and Slovenia stood at an intermediate level of liberalization. All other countries showed indices below 25 percent, although in some of these countries (in particular, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina) the enforcement of capital controls is so weak that the index is likely to significantly underestimate the actual openness of their capital accounts.\n\nRatings and Access to the International Capital Markets\n\nRatings. The majority of the countries included in this analysis have seen an improvement, very marked in a number of cases, in their credit ratings in recent years (see Table 2.11), Twelve countries have already been assigned long-term foreign-currency sovereign ratings by the major international rating agencies. Among the CEE countries, five (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia) enjoy investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, with the Czech Republic and Slovenia having been granted an A level mark by at least one of those rating agencies.37 The last CEE country to have joined this group is Croatia, which was assigned the lowest investment grade ratings by both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in January 1997. The Slovak Republic had also been assigned investment grade ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in 1995–96, but Moody’s downgraded the country’s debt from Baa3 to Bal in March 1998, Bulgaria and Romania remain at the subinvestment grade category, and the rest of the CEE countries have not yet been rated. Among the Mediterranean countries considered here, Israel, Malta, and Cyprus all enjoy A level ratings at present. In contrast with this generally positive trend, Turkey has been successively downgraded since 1994 from an investment grade mark to the lowest mark in the noninvestment grade.38\n\nTable 2.11.\n\nSovereign Credit Ratings1\n\nSources: Moody’s Investor Service; and Standard & Poor’s\n\n1Ratings on long-term foreign currency bonds.

The rating increases for Croatia. Poland, and Slovenia have been particularly sharp. Slovenia’s ratings and those of the Czech Republic (which improved less markedly but from a higher level) are already quite close to those enjoyed by the prospective southern EMU countries (see Table 2.12 and Table 2.13). The Slovak Republic’s rating also improved significantly from a relatively favorable position, after a delay caused by the uncertainties associated with the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and its expected negative impact on the Slovak Republic’s fiscal and balance of payments positions. Success with macroeconomic and political stabilization and, except in the case of Croatia, closer economic and political ties with the EU (including the signing of Association Agreements) seem to be major factors behind the positive evolution of these five countries’ ratings.41 Bulgaria and Romania stand at an intermediate level, having seen moderate improvements from rather low levels. Finally, Albania and the other republics of the former Yugoslavia have seen no improvement in their ratings, which remain very low reflecting a combination of political and economic instability, low per capita income, and structural problems.42\n\nAs for the Mediterranean countries, Cyprus and Israel have both seen in recent years substantial improvements in the ratings published by Euromoney and The Institutional Investor, while Malta’s ratings have remained approximately stable. As in the case of the Czech Republic and Slovenia, these countries’ ratings are currently not far from those of prospective southern EMU countries. Turkey’s ratings, by contrast, have fallen substantially below those of the most advanced CEE countries, mirroring the negative trend observed in its agency ratings.\n\nMarket access, Table 2.14 provides data on the total funds raised by the countries under study in the markets for international bonds, international equity placements, and medium- and long-term syndicated bank loans since 1991. Total borrowing in these three international capital markets had until recently been highly concentrated in a handful of countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, and Turkey), but the number of countries with access to these markets increased rapidly over the last three years as new ratings were assigned (often, as noted, of the investment grade category) and existing ratings upgraded, and as some countries normalized their relations with commercial bank creditors. Total borrowing in these three markets, as a percentage of these countries’ combined GDP, has increased substantially since the early 1990s. At the same time, spreads on bond issues and bank loans have narrowed considerably for most countries; in the first half of 1997, just before the East Asian financial crisis, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Israel, and Slovenia were able to place bonds at spreads of fewer than 60 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasury bonds and/or to obtain bank loans at margins of fewer than 30 basis points over LIBOR.43\n\nTable 2.14.\n\nFunds Raised in the International Capital Markets1\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\nSource: IMF, Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Gross issuance of international bonds and international equity, and new commitments of medium- and long-term syndicated bank loans.\n\nTable 2.14.\n\nFunds Raised in the International Capital Markets1\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\n1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 CEE countries 1.0 1.0 2.3 1.5 2.5 2.7 3.3 Bulgaria 0.5 0.0 0.0 1.9 0.0 0.0 0.1 Croatia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 2.8 7.4 Czechoslovakia, former 0.8 0.4 … … … … … Czech Republic … … 2.5 2.5 1.8 3.1 1.7 Hungary 4.5 4.8 13.2 6.9 11.4 5.8 7.6 Poland 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.7 0.4 2.6 Romania 0.1 0.3 0.0 0.2 0.8 3.9 1.7 Slovak Republic … … 2.0 2.1 3.1 7.7 4.5 Slovenia … … 0.9 0.8 1.4 4.2 2.5 Mediterranean countries 1.3 2.9 3.6 3.3 2.8 3.2 3.3 Cyprus 2.3 0.5 0.8 1.0 0.0 1.6 3.4 Israel 0.2 0.9 0.4 4.1 3.2 1.5 2.0 Malta 0.0 3.6 3.7 8.1 7.6 4.0 0.0 Turkey 1.5 2.3 3.1 4.9 3.2 3.4 4.0\n\nSource: IMF, Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Gross issuance of international bonds and international equity, and new commitments of medium- and long-term syndicated bank loans.\n\nTable 2.14.\n\nFunds Raised in the International Capital Markets1\n\n(In percent of GDP)\n\n1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 CEE countries 1.0 1.0 2.3 1.5 2.5 2.7 3.3 Bulgaria 0.5 0.0 0.0 1.9 0.0 0.0 0.1 Croatia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 2.8 7.4 Czechoslovakia, former 0.8 0.4 … … … … … Czech Republic … … 2.5 2.5 1.8 3.1 1.7 Hungary 4.5 4.8 13.2 6.9 11.4 5.8 7.6 Poland 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.7 0.4 2.6 Romania 0.1 0.3 0.0 0.2 0.8 3.9 1.7 Slovak Republic … … 2.0 2.1 3.1 7.7 4.5 Slovenia … … 0.9 0.8 1.4 4.2 2.5 Mediterranean countries 1.3 2.9 3.6 3.3 2.8 3.2 3.3 Cyprus 2.3 0.5 0.8 1.0 0.0 1.6 3.4 Israel 0.2 0.9 0.4 4.1 3.2 1.5 2.0 Malta 0.0 3.6 3.7 8.1 7.6 4.0 0.0 Turkey 1.5 2.3 3.1 4.9 3.2 3.4 4.0\n\nSource: IMF, Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Gross issuance of international bonds and international equity, and new commitments of medium- and long-term syndicated bank loans.\n\nAppendix II provides more details on trends in market access in the countries under review by examining data on issues of international bonds, international equity placements, and syndicated bank loans.\n\nCorrelations Between Stock Market Indices\n\nAs another indication of international financial integration, this section provides background data and discusses evidence on international correlations between stock market indices for those countries under study for which data are available from the International Financial Corporation’s (IFC) Emerging Market Database (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey). These four countries, together with Israel, are the only ones that have managed to develop stock markets with significant levels of capitalization and liquidity.\n\nAs shown in Table 2.15—which reports market capitalization, turnover, and the number of listed companies—the Czech and Polish stock exchanges and, to a lesser extent, the Hungarian one have been expanding rapidly. The Hungarian, Polish, and Turkish exchanges have also been among the emerging stock exchanges with the best price performance in recent years (see Figure 2.3 and 2.4).44 The Warsaw Stock Exchange has become the largest in Central and Eastern Europe, and enjoys relatively high turnover and liquidity. The Istanbul Stock Exchange has also grown at a rapid pace, and is now one of the stock markets with the highest turnover ratios worldwide and the 29th in terms of market capitalization. Regarding the participation of foreign investors, there is evidence of a relatively important presence in the Istanbul and Warsaw exchanges but of a more modest involvement in the Budapest and Prague exchanges. The role of foreign investors, however, seems to be increasing in all of them.45\n\nTable 2.15.\n\nStock Markets of Selected Non-EU Countries\n\nSources: International Finance Corporation, Emerging Stock Markets factbook 1998; and national stock exchanges.\n\n1Trading in shares of companies listed on Bulgaria s stock exchange was suspended in October 1996.\n\n2Excludes investment companies.\n\n3The sharp decline in the number of listed companies recorded in 1997 largely reflects a tightening of listing requirements.\n\nTable 2.15.\n\nStock Markets of Selected Non-EU Countries\n\n1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 (In millions of U.S. dollars; end of period) Market capitalization Bulgaria … … … … … … 61 7 2 Croatia … … … … … 514 581 2,977 4,246 Czech Republic … … … … … 5,938 15,664 18,077 12,786 Hungary … … 505 562 812 1,604 2,399 5,273 14,975 Poland … … 144 222 2,706 3,057 4,564 8,390 12,135 Romania … … … … … 52 201 122 630 Slovak Republic … … … … … 1,093 1,235 2,182 1,826 Slovenia … … … … … 595 311 663 1,613 Cyprus … … 1,290 1,163 981 1,334 2,516 2,355 2,011 Israel 8,227 3,324 6,176 29,634 50,773 32,730 36,399 35,934 45,268 Malta … … … … … 52 … 472 … Turkey 6,783 19,065 15,703 9,931 37,496 21,605 20,772 30,020 61,090 (Total value traded as a percentage of market capitalization) Turnover ratios Bulgaria1 … … … … … … 6.6 0.1 0.0 Croatia … … … … … 104.4 8.2 … 14.0 Czech Republic … … … … … 22.4 24.9 50.3 47.9 Hungary … … 23.2 6.3 14.2 21.6 17.3 41.6 75.9 Poland … … 19.4 89.7 129.1 176.7 71.5 848 78.4 Romania … … … … … … 1.0 14.4 72.7 Slovak Republic … … … … … 11.0 69.9 13.4 108.0 Slovenia … … … … … … 57.6 68.8 30.8 Cyprus … … 5.0 7.5 3.0 7.3 15.3 19.1 15.1 Israel 59.3 97.2 182.9 75.3 73.5 60.4 25.9 22.2 26.7 Malta … … … … … 5.8 … 3.0 … Turkey 19.0 42.4 52.9 66.3 80.9 94.2 226.0 133.3 129.7 (End of period) Number of listed domestic companies 2 Bulgaria … … … … … 16 26 15 15 Croatia … … … … … 29 61 … 77 Czech Republic3 … … … … … 1,024 1,635 1,588 276 Hungary … … 21 23 28 40 42 45 49 Poland … … 9 16 22 44 65 53 143 Romania … … … … … 4 14 34 76 Slovak Republic … … … … … 18 18 816 872 Slovenia … … 24 … 16 25 17 21 26 Cyprus … … 40 39 39 38 41 39 40 Israel 262 216 229 377 558 638 654 655 640 Malta … … … … … 4 5 6 … Turkey 50 110 134 145 152 176 205 229 257\n\nSources: International Finance Corporation, Emerging Stock Markets factbook 1998; and national stock exchanges.\n\n1Trading in shares of companies listed on Bulgaria s stock exchange was suspended in October 1996.\n\n2Excludes investment companies.\n\n3The sharp decline in the number of listed companies recorded in 1997 largely reflects a tightening of listing requirements.\n\nTable 2.15.\n\nStock Markets of Selected Non-EU Countries\n\n1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 (In millions of U.S. dollars; end of period) Market capitalization Bulgaria … … … … … … 61 7 2 Croatia … … … … … 514 581 2,977 4,246 Czech Republic … … … … … 5,938 15,664 18,077 12,786 Hungary … … 505 562 812 1,604 2,399 5,273 14,975 Poland … … 144 222 2,706 3,057 4,564 8,390 12,135 Romania … … … … … 52 201 122 630 Slovak Republic … … … … … 1,093 1,235 2,182 1,826 Slovenia … … … … … 595 311 663 1,613 Cyprus … … 1,290 1,163 981 1,334 2,516 2,355 2,011 Israel 8,227 3,324 6,176 29,634 50,773 32,730 36,399 35,934 45,268 Malta … … … … … 52 … 472 … Turkey 6,783 19,065 15,703 9,931 37,496 21,605 20,772 30,020 61,090 (Total value traded as a percentage of market capitalization) Turnover ratios Bulgaria1 … … … … … … 6.6 0.1 0.0 Croatia … … … … … 104.4 8.2 … 14.0 Czech Republic … … … … … 22.4 24.9 50.3 47.9 Hungary … … 23.2 6.3 14.2 21.6 17.3 41.6 75.9 Poland … … 19.4 89.7 129.1 176.7 71.5 848 78.4 Romania … … … … … … 1.0 14.4 72.7 Slovak Republic … … … … … 11.0 69.9 13.4 108.0 Slovenia … … … … … … 57.6 68.8 30.8 Cyprus … … 5.0 7.5 3.0 7.3 15.3 19.1 15.1 Israel 59.3 97.2 182.9 75.3 73.5 60.4 25.9 22.2 26.7 Malta … … … … … 5.8 … 3.0 … Turkey 19.0 42.4 52.9 66.3 80.9 94.2 226.0 133.3 129.7 (End of period) Number of listed domestic companies 2 Bulgaria … … … … … 16 26 15 15 Croatia … … … … … 29 61 … 77 Czech Republic3 … … … … … 1,024 1,635 1,588 276 Hungary … … 21 23 28 40 42 45 49 Poland … … 9 16 22 44 65 53 143 Romania … … … … … 4 14 34 76 Slovak Republic … … … … … 18 18 816 872 Slovenia … … 24 … 16 25 17 21 26 Cyprus … … 40 39 39 38 41 39 40 Israel 262 216 229 377 558 638 654 655 640 Malta … … … … … 4 5 6 … Turkey 50 110 134 145 152 176 205 229 257\n\nSources: International Finance Corporation, Emerging Stock Markets factbook 1998; and national stock exchanges.\n\n1Trading in shares of companies listed on Bulgaria s stock exchange was suspended in October 1996.\n\n2Excludes investment companies.\n\n3The sharp decline in the number of listed companies recorded in 1997 largely reflects a tightening of listing requirements.\n\nTable 2.16 shows a matrix of price index correlations, based on monthly changes in the relevant indices during the period December 1991-December 1996. The four markets considered (particularly the Czech and Turkish exchanges) show higher correlations with regional indices that contain a predominant share of emerging markets (such as the IFCG Composite) than with indices based on the major stock markets of industrial countries. This is what one might expect, given that emerging stock markets tend to move together to some extent (particularly those where foreign institutional investors play a significant role). It is also in line with the pattern observed in other emerging markets for which the IFC provides correlations. A particularly interesting observation is that the Budapest and Warsaw stock markets show correlations vis-à-vis industrial country stock exchanges that are substantially higher than those shown on average by other emerging markets.46 Also, the correlations of the Istanbul, Prague, and Warsaw stock exchanges vis-à-vis developed markets indices tend to be higher with those indices that have a high content of European stocks (such as the Financial Times47 Europac and the index calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International). Finally, all four markets show relatively high correlations with individual EU emerging markets, such as the Lisbon and Athens stock exchanges.\n\nTable 2.16.\n\nCorrelations of Stock Market Indices1\n\n(December 1991-December 1996)\n\nSource: International finance Corporation, Emerging Stock Markets Factbook, 1997.\n\n1Coefficient of correlation of monthly changes in U.S. dollar-converted indices during the period December 1991-December 1996.\n\n2Simple average of Czech Republic Hungary, and Poland.\n\n3Simple average of 23 non-European emerging markets for which correlations were available.\n\n4Index calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International.

The relatively higher correlations vis-à-vis European indices also suggest that financial integration may be proceeding somewhat faster with the European countries (and in particular the prospective EMU countries) than with other regions of the world.\n\nChanges in the Exchange Rate of the Euro\n\nThe impact on non-EU countries’ debt service of a change in the euro exchange rate against other major international currencies depends on the share of euro-denominated debt in total debt and on the exchange rate regime of the country in question.59 Thus, for example, a country that pegs its currency to the euro and has a low share of euro-denominated debt will experience important fluctuations in its debt-service costs as a result of changes in the exchange rate of the euro against other major currencies, with these costs increasing if the euro depreciates and declining it’ it appreciates. On the other hand, the debt service of a country with a peg to the euro but a high share of euro-denominated debt, a peg to the U.S. dollar but a low share of euro-denominated debt, or with a currency composition of its debt reflecting the weights of the different currencies in the basket of peg, will be little affected by a change in the exchange rate of the euro against third currencies. The exchange rate regimes of the countries under analysis were summarized in Table 2.4.\n\nApart from the fact that the currency composition of debt, the debt-to-export ratio, and the exchange rate regime may have significantly changed by the time EMU materializes, an important limitation of an analysis based exclusively on the information shown in the tables is that it would not take into account possible operations aimed at hedging the foreign exchange exposure associated with the currency composition of debt. Thus, for example, in January 1997, Hungary undertook swap operations aimed at ensuring that the currency composition of its foreign debt was the same as that of the currency basket to which its currency is linked, thus insulating its debt service from changes in cross rates. Since Hungary’s reference basket assigns weights of 70 percent to the deutsche mark and 30 percent to the U.S. dollar, these swaps imply a higher effective share of debt denominated in the currencies of EMU participants than shown in Table 2.18.\n\nThe main conclusion to be drawn from the information in Table 2.18 and Table 2.4 is that a large number of countries combine a relatively low share of debt denominated in EMU currencies with an exchange rate regime emphasizing stability vis-à-vis these currencies or the ECU, making their debt service highly vulnerable to changes in the exchange rate of the euro against third currencies. These countries include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia. Many of these countries peg dc jure or de facto their currencies to the deutsche mark, the ECU, or a basket of currencies in which the deutsche mark has a predominant weight. And in all of them, except Malta and perhaps Cyprus, debt in EMU currencies accounts for less than 15 percent (in most cases less than 10 percent) of total debt.60” The Czech Republic could also be included in this group. Although this country abandoned its peg to a deutsche-mark-dominated basket in May 1997, the Czech authorities continue to aim at achieving a relatively high degree of exchange rate stability vis-à-vis the German currency.61\n\nAmong this group of vulnerable countries, Bulgaria stands out because it has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio and the most rigid peg to the deutsche mark of all the countries under analysis. Moreover, its currency board arrangement foresees the replacement of the peg to the deutsche mark with a peg to the euro once EMU is launched. Thus, an EMU-induced depreciation of the euro could create serious debt-service difficulties in this country/’ 62\n\nAt the other extreme, the countries whose debt service seems most protected from fluctuations in the euro are Hungary, which, although it has the highest DSR, has insulated its debt service from changes in the exchange rates of the currencies in which it has borrowed: Poland, where EMU currencies account for similar proportions of its debt and its basket (32 percent and 40 percent, respectively); and Israel, which has a relatively low DSR, practically no debt denominated in EMU currencies, and a crawling peg with respect to a basket in which EMU currencies have a weight below 30 percent.61 Albania, Romania, and Turkey are in an intermediate situation: the share of EMU currencies in their debt is relatively low but they operate independent or managed floating exchange regimes that are not particularly geared toward a stable relationship with the euro.\n\nThe analysis above suggests that a significant number of the countries under review may want to gear the composition of their debt more toward their basket or currency of peg if they want to better insulate their debt service from changes in the euro exchange rate. More generally, the analysis underscores that countries that are vulnerable to interest and exchange rate changes in the euro area could usefully rethink their debt management policies.\n\nIssues of International Bonds\n\nUntil 1994. borrowing in the international bond market was limited to Hungary. Czechoslovakia and its successor republics, Turkey, and Israel, with issuance (largely sovereign) by Hungary and Turkey alone accounting for about 70 percent of the amounts issued between 1990 and 1994 Table 2.20.64 With the exception of Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, however, all the other countries under analysis have tapped this market at some point since 1995. Following the debt restructuring agreed with commercial banks and the assignment of favorable ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, Poland made a successful comeback to the international capital markets with the issuance of a five-year, $250 million Eurobond in June 1995. Since then, Polish issuance has accelerated quite markedly, with Poland becoming by far the most active issuer among CEE countries in 1997.65 The normalization of relations with their creditors and the investment grade marks obtained from the rating agencies have also allowed Croatia and Slovenia to raise substantial funds in the international bond market in 1996–97.66 Romania, despite its subinvestment grade ratings, has been present in this market since 1996.\n\nTable 2.20.\n\nIssues of International Bonds and Equity\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, unless indicated otherwise)\n\nSource: IMR Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Including note issues under Euro Medium-Term Notes (EMNT) programs.\n\nTable 2.20.\n\nIssues of International Bonds and Equity\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, unless indicated otherwise)\n\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 International bonds 1 CEE countries 1,263 1,511 1,614 5,735 2,404 3,651 3,317 3,721 Croatia … … 0 0 0 26 54 531 Czechoslovakia, former 375 276 129 … … … … … Czech Republic … … … 694 400 0 543 450 Hungary 888 1,235 1,485 4,801 1,729 3,311 333 414 Poland 0 0 0 0 0 250 314 1,662 Romania 0 0 0 0 0 1,043 427 Slovak Republic … … … 240 275 64 705 0 Slovenia … … … 0 0 0 325 237 Mediterranean countries 593 897 3,190 5,974 3,377 2,729 3,776 5,387 Cyprus 0 0 0 0 0 0 85 300 Israel 0 400 0 2,052 2,313 250 800 873 Malta 0 0 0 0 205 0 0 0 Turkey 593 497 3,190 3,922 859 2,479 2,891 4,214 Emerging economies 6,335 12,838 23,780 62,671 56,790 57,619 101,926 127,858 Shares in total issuance by emerging economies (%) CEE countries 19.9 11.8 6.8 9.2 4.2 6.3 3.3 2.9 Mediterranean countries 9.4 7.0 13.4 9.5 5.9 4.7 3.7 4.2 Share of emerging economies in global issuance (%) 2.8 4.3 7.1 12.5 12.3 11.5 14.4 16.7 International equity CEE countries 68 91 33 18 211 489 448 2,377 Croatia … … 0 0 0 0 90 0 Czechoslovakia, former 0 0 0 … … … … … Czech Republic … … … 0 10 32 104 0 Hungary 68 91 33 17 200 274 227 1,589 Poland 0 0 0 1 0 70 17 684 Romania 0 0 0 0 1 0 10 0 Slovak Republic … … … 0 0 113 0 48 Slovenia … … 0 0 0 0 0 56 Mediterranean countries 56 60 161 514 464 274 556 901 Cyprus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Israel 0 60 127 336 89 222 544 533 Malta 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Turkey 56 0 34 178 375 52 12 368 Emerging economies 1,262 5,437 9,259 11,915 18,138 11,193 16,414 24,655 Shares in total issuance by emerging economies (%) CEE countries 5.4 1.7 0.4 0.2 1.2 4.4 2.7 9.6 Mediterranean countries 4.4 1.1 1.7 4.3 2.6 2.4 3.4 3.7 Share of emerging economies in global issuance (%) 15.5 35.0 40.9 35.0 36.9 25.3 27.5 32.4\n\nSource: IMR Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Including note issues under Euro Medium-Term Notes (EMNT) programs.\n\nTable 2.20.\n\nIssues of International Bonds and Equity\n\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, unless indicated otherwise)\n\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 International bonds 1 CEE countries 1,263 1,511 1,614 5,735 2,404 3,651 3,317 3,721 Croatia … … 0 0 0 26 54 531 Czechoslovakia, former 375 276 129 … … … … … Czech Republic … … … 694 400 0 543 450 Hungary 888 1,235 1,485 4,801 1,729 3,311 333 414 Poland 0 0 0 0 0 250 314 1,662 Romania 0 0 0 0 0 1,043 427 Slovak Republic … … … 240 275 64 705 0 Slovenia … … … 0 0 0 325 237 Mediterranean countries 593 897 3,190 5,974 3,377 2,729 3,776 5,387 Cyprus 0 0 0 0 0 0 85 300 Israel 0 400 0 2,052 2,313 250 800 873 Malta 0 0 0 0 205 0 0 0 Turkey 593 497 3,190 3,922 859 2,479 2,891 4,214 Emerging economies 6,335 12,838 23,780 62,671 56,790 57,619 101,926 127,858 Shares in total issuance by emerging economies (%) CEE countries 19.9 11.8 6.8 9.2 4.2 6.3 3.3 2.9 Mediterranean countries 9.4 7.0 13.4 9.5 5.9 4.7 3.7 4.2 Share of emerging economies in global issuance (%) 2.8 4.3 7.1 12.5 12.3 11.5 14.4 16.7 International equity CEE countries 68 91 33 18 211 489 448 2,377 Croatia … … 0 0 0 0 90 0 Czechoslovakia, former 0 0 0 … … … … … Czech Republic … … … 0 10 32 104 0 Hungary 68 91 33 17 200 274 227 1,589 Poland 0 0 0 1 0 70 17 684 Romania 0 0 0 0 1 0 10 0 Slovak Republic … … … 0 0 113 0 48 Slovenia … … 0 0 0 0 0 56 Mediterranean countries 56 60 161 514 464 274 556 901 Cyprus 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Israel 0 60 127 336 89 222 544 533 Malta 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Turkey 56 0 34 178 375 52 12 368 Emerging economies 1,262 5,437 9,259 11,915 18,138 11,193 16,414 24,655 Shares in total issuance by emerging economies (%) CEE countries 5.4 1.7 0.4 0.2 1.2 4.4 2.7 9.6 Mediterranean countries 4.4 1.1 1.7 4.3 2.6 2.4 3.4 3.7 Share of emerging economies in global issuance (%) 15.5 35.0 40.9 35.0 36.9 25.3 27.5 32.4\n\nSource: IMR Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Including note issues under Euro Medium-Term Notes (EMNT) programs.\n\nTotal international bond issues by the countries under analysis peaked in 1993 as Hungarian and Turkish issuance reached record levels and Israeli is sues increased sharply. Bond issues diminished in 1994–95 reflecting lower issues by Hungary and the abrupt decline in Turkish issuance in the wake of the 1994 financial crisis in Turkey, They recovered gradually in 1996 and more markedly in the first three quarters of 1997, although they came to a halt in all but three countries in the fourth quarter of 1997.67 These trends largely mirrored those seen in emerging countries as a whole: a boom in issuance in 1993; a decline in 1994–95 (partly reflecting the impact of the Mexican crisis): an abrupt recovery in 1996 and the first three quarters of 1997; and a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 1997 as the turmoil in East Asia depressed the market.\n\nYield spreads at launch over comparable government bonds issued by industrial countries have sharply declined in countries with investment grade ratings in recent years, with a few of them (the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Israel, and Slovenia) having been able to place bonds at spreads of 60 basis points or less in the 12 months preceding the East Asian crisis (Table 2.21). These spreads are very narrow when compared with the average spreads paid by emerging economies as a whole (see memorandum items in Table 2.21). In fact, they are similar to those paid by many Western and East Asian advanced countries. Particularly noteworthy are the 37 basis points spread paid by Cyprus in the first half of 1997, and the placement by Slovenia of a DM 400 million seven-year sovereign issue at a spread of only 43 basis points in the spring of 1997, which set a new pricing low for CEE issuers. It is also significant that Croatia and Poland, both of which have below A level investment ratings, have been able to place international bonds at spreads of only about 80 basis points before the East Asian turmoil: in the first half of 1997, Croatia issued successfully a $300 million sovereign Eurobond at an 80 basis points spread and Poland placed at an 83 basis points spread the 10-year tranche of a two-tranche sovereign issue in the dollar sector. Romania and Turkey, by contrast, have continued to pay spreads of 300 basis points or more in their latest issues, with Turkey’s spread having substantially widened since 1994, consistent with the evolution of its ratings. The spreads paid by these two countries, however, are in line with the average spreads paid by emerging countries as a whole.\n\nTable 2.21.\n\nYield Spread at Launch for Unenhanced Bond Issues1\n\n(in basis paints)\n\nSource: IMF: Private Market Financing for Developing Countries.\n\n1Excludes issues not denominated in U.S. dollars.
