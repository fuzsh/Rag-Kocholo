        "text": "The Renewed Partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood, adopted in 2021 sets out a new agenda for the EU’s partnership with our partners in the southern Neighbourhood.\n\nThe Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is an intergovernmental institution that brings together all EU countries and 15 countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean to promote dialogue and cooperation.\n\nResearch and Innovation\n\nThe EU’s Global Approach to Research and Innovation aims to strengthen long-term regional cooperation through the creation of sustainable economies linking scientific and technological innovation with employment opportunities.\n\nThe EU maintains regional policy dialogue with Mediterranean partners in the context of the UfM Regional Platform on Research and Innovation, as well as bilateral joint science and technology cooperation agreements with partner countries in the region. These currently include Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nRegional Platform on Research and Innovation\n\nCo-chaired by the EC and Jordan, the UfM Regional Platform on Research and Innovation brings the EU and all Mediterranean partner countries together for political dialogue, acting as a forum for the exchange of information and recommendations on research and innovation policy in the Mediterranean region. The platform aims at establishing a common information base, and identifying issues of regional importance to be addressed by research and innovation and requiring cooperative Euro-Mediterranean action.\n\nPlatform Members\n\nAlbania, Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Mauritania, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, The Netherlands, Palestine, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Syria (Syria suspended its membership on 1 December 2011), Tunisia, Turkey.\n\nLibya has observer status.\n\nA major milestone was reached at the Ministerial Conference on Strengthening Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation through Research and Innovation in 2017. The Valletta Declaration was adopted, entailing several agreements:\n\ncooperating more closely on research about root causes of migration\n\ndeveloping a Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean (PRIMA)\n\npromoting research and innovation to create \"blue jobs\" and growth in the Mediterranean (BLUEMED initiative)\n\nBuilding on the Valletta Declaration, the UfM Regional Platform on Research and Innovation has engaged in strategic discussions since 2019. 3 priorities to orient research and innovation collaboration at both regional and national levels were defined: Climate Change, Renewable Energies and Health.\n\nPreparation of roadmaps\n\nA regional expert group consisting of leading academics and practitioners in the 3 priority fields was commissioned to prepare roadmaps identifying possible research, innovation and capacity-building actions addressing urgent needs in the region. They were developed through public consultation events with the participation of a wide network of stakeholders and specialists in the Euro-Mediterranean region.\n\nThe expert group finalised the roadmaps by highlighting the following overarching policy recommendations:\n\nsignificantly increase the exchange and circulation of knowledge and information in the three priority areas, together with the implementation of platforms for facilitating the availability and communication of timely and reliable data also accessible to stakeholders\n\npromote demonstration of transdisciplinary projects on sustainable development in the Euro-Mediterranean Region\n\npromote technology cooperation\n\nThe roadmaps aim to engage actors at large in the region (NGOs, scientific institutions, researchers, networks of Universities and citizens, the private sector and decision makers), as well as international organisations, financial institutions and donors. The targeted outcomes are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.\n\nState-of-play: implementation plan\n\nAn Implementation Plan, elaborated by the UfM Regional Platform on Research and Innovation, has been put in place to transform the jointly agreed priorities into specific actions, reviewing its progress while fostering synergies with existing instruments. Those priorities, as well as their respective roadmaps, were endorsed at the Research and Innovation UfM Ministerial meeting in June 2022.\n\nThe implementation plan sets out set of implementing modalities resting on 4 main pillars.\n\nPillar 1: Mapping and analysis of research and innovation relevant projects in the region\n\nThe report, aimed at identifying and benchmarking existing cooperation against the roadmaps to identify gaps, was published in January 2023.\n\nA EUROMED research and innovation cooperation project portfolio of 252 projects funded by Horizon 2020, PRIMA and the ENI CBC programme was analysed and assessed, based on the project description, the relevance of the projects to the 3 priorities (Health, Renewable Energy and Climate Change) and their specific focus areas as outlined in the UfM’s Theories of Change and Impact Pathways (TCIP).\n\nA second phase of this mapping exercise is currently ongoing to assess the potential scalability of a selected list of projects.\n\nPillar 2: Integration of needed actions into existing programmes\n\nThe European Commission launched the Mediterranean Initiative as part of Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 linked to the roadmaps. The European Commission is currently working towards the continuation of the Union’s participation in (PRIMA) under Horizon Europe for three additional years until 2027.\n\nAdditional actions put in place by the European Commission include:\n\nUnder the ‘Clean Hydrogen’ mission of Mission Innovation:\n\nimplementing exchange of best practices and knowledge on hydrogen valleys with Mediterranean countries through the second sprint in 2023\n\nexploring setting up specific Project Development Assistance for the Mediterranean countries to develop hydrogen valleys as of 2024\n\nunder the Global Health Joint Undertaking:\n\npromotion of participation of researchers from the Mediterranean region in the calls as contributing partners;\n\nUnder the European Partnership on Personalised Medicine and the one on Rare Diseases:\n\nongoing discussions with funding agencies from Mediterranean countries to join these Partnerships\n\nUnder the Horizon Europe Mission ‘Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030’:\n\nthe establishment of the Mediterranean zero pollution Lighthouse and implementation charter.\n\nPillar 3: Stakeholders’ communication and coordination research and innovation platform\n\nThe European Commission has commissioned the co-creation of a UfM Research and Innovation Platform to build a joint knowledge management and communication framework (KMCF) to support the UfM Regional Policy Dialogue on Research and Innovation in the implementation of the roadmaps.\n\nThis is intended to provide an efficient framework for knowledge management and communication among relevant stakeholders and to develop a sustainable EU-Mediterranean learning and collaborative hub between stakeholders and across regions.\n\nPillar 4: Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL)\n\nA Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) framework is being created to measure progress in the implementation of the roadmaps and priority areas and ensure accountability. The MEL framework was adopted during the 29th Meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean Regional Platform in Research and Innovation on 4 October 2023.\n\nFunding opportunities\n\nHorizon Europe\n\nHorizon Europe, the European Union’s framework programme for research and innovation, is open to the world, which means that participants from almost any country can participate in most calls. The EU can fund the participation in Horizon Europe collaborative research actions of entities established in EU Member States, in countries Associated to Horizon Europe, and in low- and middle-income countries. Most Southern Mediterranean partner countries are included in this latter category.\n\nMediterranean Initiative: The Horizon Europe work programme 2023-2024 includes 37 topics that are flagged as particularly relevant for cooperation with the Mediterranean region. The calls can be found here.\n\nEuropean Research Council\n\nThe European Research Council offers grants to researchers in all research domains for frontier research. Researchers from Southern Mediterranean countries are welcome to apply and if selected are eligible for funding to establish a research group in Europe.\n\nGrants are available for researchers starting or consolidating their independent career and for advanced researchers. Synergy grants are also available, where a group of 2-4 Principal Investigators (PIs) may include one PI outside the EU or countries associated to Horizon Europe, to tackle together an ambitious research problem, with all funded by the ERC.\n\nMarie Skłodowska Curie Actions\n\nMarie Skłodowska Curie Actions offer fellowships for post-doctoral researchers from Mediterranean Partner countries (and other countries) to spend up to 2 years in a European group – or for European researchers to spend up to 2 years in Mediterranean Partner Countries. Also offers opportunities for Southern Mediterranean institutions to participate in Doctoral Training Networks and Staff Exchange consortia.\n\nNEXT MED\n\nNEXT MED will continue supporting Euro-Mediterranean cooperation for the period 2021-2027 under the framework of the European Union’s Cohesion Policy and its specific ‘Interreg’ instrument which supports European Territorial Cooperation across regions and countries.\n\nThe Digital Europe Programme\n\nThe Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL) is a new EU funding programme focused on bringing digital technology to businesses, citizens and public administrations.\n\nPRIMA\n\nThe Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA) is a joint programme which focusses on building research and innovation capacities and developing knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems, to make them sustainable, and for integrated water provision and management in the Mediterranean area.\n\nBLUEMED\n\nThe Bluemed Initiative is aiming at advancing a shared vision for a more healthy, productive, resilient, better known and valued Mediterranean Sea, promoting the citizens’ social well-being and prosperity, and boosting economic growth and jobs.\n\nProjects and results\n\nResearch project database\n\nEU-funded research projects involving the Mediterranean and Middle East\n\nFor previous framework programmes, please contact the Research enquiry service.\n\nThe Horizon Dashboard, is a one-stop shop for data and statistics on the EU Research and Innovation Programmes – from FP1 to Horizon Europe.\n\nContact\n\nNational Contact Points\n\nThe National Contact Points (NCPs) provide guidance, practical information and assistance on all aspects of participation in Horizon Europe.\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nRTD-F2-ASSISTec [dot] europa [dot] eu (DG Research and Innovation unit F.2: International cooperation)\n\nEuraxess Africa\n\nEuraxess Africa provides access to a complete range of information and support services for researchers in African and Mediterranean countries wishing to pursue a research career in Europe or looking for collaboration opportunities through Horizon Europe."
