        "text": "Ethnic groups and religions\n\nA variety of ethnic groups coexist within the republic. Croats constitute about nine-tenths of the population. Serbs make up the largest minority group; however, their proportion fell dramatically as a result of the 1990s war of independence—from more than one-tenth of the population before the war to less than half that figure in 2001. In addition to the Croats and the Serbs, there are small groups of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), Hungarians, Italians, and Slovenes as well as a few thousand Albanians, Austrians, Bulgarians, Czechs, Germans, and other nationalities.\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Croatia\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Andrej Plenković\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 3,696,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 0.937 euro\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Zoran Milanović\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 22, 2024, 4:32 AM ET (ABC News (U.S.))\n\nCroatia to reintroduce compulsory military draft as regional tensions soar\n\nAug. 21, 2024, 8:35 AM ET (New York Times)\n\nCroatia dual national Sigur switches to Canada\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 3:36 AM ET (CBS)\n\nMen in Croatia to serve in the military for two months starting in 2025\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 8:06 AM ET (The Guardian)\n\nSerbia revel in win over bitter rivals Croatia for third successive water polo gold\n\nAug. 11, 2024, 5:53 AM ET (BBC)\n\nParis Olympics: Serbia beat Croatia for third straight water polo gold\n\nIt has been estimated that the number of Croats living outside the borders of Croatia is comparable to the number living inside the country. Many ethnic Croats reside in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Croats have lived since the Slavs first migrated to the western Balkan Peninsula in the 6th and 7th centuries ce. Although there has traditionally been a yearning for unification with Croatia among the Croats of Herzegovina (a region contiguous to Dalmatia), this sentiment has not generally been shared by Croats within Croatia or even by Croats in Bosnia. Many of the Serbs in Croatia are descendants of people who migrated to the border areas of the Holy Roman Empire between the 16th and 18th centuries, following the Ottoman conquest of Serbia and Bosnia.\n\nThere is traditionally a close correlation between ethnic identity and religious affiliation. The Croats are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic and more Western-influenced than the Serbs, who are overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox. A small minority of people are nonreligious or atheist. Bosniaks constitute most of the Muslim population.\n\nLanguages\n\nCroats speak Croatian, a South Slavic language of the Indo-European family. Croatian is quite similar to Serbian and Bosnian, but political developments since the collapse of Yugoslavia have encouraged the three ethnic groups to emphasize the differences between their languages. The clearest distinction between the Croatian and Serbian variants of what was previously called the Serbo-Croatian language is the script, with Croatian written in the Latin alphabet and Serbian in the Cyrillic. Distinctions of grammar and pronunciation also occur, as do more striking differences in vocabulary, which result partly from differential historical patterns of foreign domination. For Croats, this has resulted in a sprinkling of German, Hungarian, and (in Dalmatia and Istria) Italian vocabulary, while the Serbs’ speech shows Turkish and Russian influences. In addition, there have been various movements to “purify” the Croatian language, which have led to further differences.\n\nAnother linguistic distinction, reflecting the legacies of history as well as the effects of geography, can be heard in the colourful medley of regional dialects and subdialects that survive to this day. The standard Croatian literary language, based on the Shtokavian dialect, emerged in the second half of the 19th century as a result of an effort to unite all South Slavs. Although all three major branches of Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian, Chakavian, and Kajkavian) were spoken by Croats (as they still are today), the Shtokavian dialect was the most widely heard in Croatian regions of eastern Slavonia, the Adriatic littoral from Makarska to Dubrovnik, and Herzegovina, as well as Montenegro and Serbia. It was therefore adopted by leading Croatian national intellectuals of the 19th century.\n\nSettlement patterns\n\nMore than half of the population resides in urban areas, particularly in the upper arm of the country and along the Adriatic coast. Settlement is relatively sparse in the central mountainous area. While most of Croatia’s Serbs live in urban centres, a significant number are scattered in villages and towns, mostly in lightly populated parts of the central mountain belt, in the regions of Lika and Banija, and in northern Dalmatia. There is also a smaller concentration of Serbs in Slavonia, although this area was particularly hard-hit by anti-Serb ethnic cleansing during the 1991–95 war.\n\nDemographic trends\n\nThe major demographic trend of the post-World War II period was rapid urbanization and a consequent migration from rural areas—especially from the less-prosperous karstic regions of Lika and Gorski Kotar in the central mountain belt, from Dalmatia, and from islands in the Adriatic but also from the Pannonian regions of Banija and Baranja. As a result, in the second half of the 20th century, the portion of the population employed in agriculture dropped from about two-thirds to less than one-fifth, and larger cities grew significantly; Zagreb, for example, more than doubled its metropolitan population. Parallel to this rapid urbanization was a sharp decrease in the birth rate. A much larger drop in infant mortality meant that Croatia’s population continued to increase—although at a very low rate—until the 1990s, when wartime displacement, emigration, and deaths caused the population to plummet by several hundred thousand. After hitting a plateau in the second half of the ’90s, the population remained at roughly the same level into the 21st century. The many emigrants who left Croatia during the 20th century have created significant diasporas in Canada, the United States, Australia, and other countries. Croatian expatriates have sometimes played an important role in political developments in their homeland."
