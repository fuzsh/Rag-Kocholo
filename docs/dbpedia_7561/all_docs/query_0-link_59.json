The Commission, or the High Representative, as appropriate, shall submit a draft of the protocols for conclusion to the Council.\n\nThis procedure is without prejudice to the exercise of the Union's own competences and does not affect the allocation of powers between the Union and the Member States as regards the conclusion of such agreements in the future or any other amendments not related to accession.\n\n3.

To that effect, amendments to the bilateral textile agreements and arrangements referred to in the first subparagraph may be negotiated by the Union with the third countries concerned prior to the date of accession.\n\nShould the amendments to the bilateral textile agreements and arrangements not have entered into force by the date of accession, the Union shall make the necessary adjustments to its rules for the import of textile and clothing products from third countries to take into account the accession of Croatia.\n\n7. The quantitative restrictions applied by the Union on imports of steel and steel products shall be adjusted on the basis of imports of Croatia over recent years of steel and steel products originating in the supplier countries concerned.\n\nTo that effect, the necessary amendments to the bilateral steel agreements and arrangements concluded between the Union and third countries shall be negotiated prior to the date of accession.\n\nShould the amendments to the bilateral steel agreements and arrangements not have entered into force by the date of accession, the provisions of the first subparagraph shall apply.\n\n8.

Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) [10] shall not apply to Croatia for the whole programming period 2007-2013.\n\nIn the year 2013, Croatia shall be allocated EUR 27,7 million (current prices) under the Rural Development Component referred to in Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006.\n\n2. Temporary additional rural development measures for Croatia are laid out in Annex VI.\n\n3. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, adopt rules necessary for the application of Annex VI. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 90(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 in conjunction with Article 13(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers [11] or the relevant procedure as determined in the applicable legislation.\n\n4. The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, and after consulting the European Parliament, shall make any adaptations to Annex VI, where necessary, to ensure coherence with the regulations concerning rural development.\n\nTITLE IV OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n1. The Commission shall closely monitor all commitments undertaken by Croatia in the accession negotiations, including those which must be achieved before or by the date of accession. The Commission's monitoring shall consist of regularly updated monitoring tables, dialogue under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part [12] (hereinafter referred to as the \"SAA\"), peer assessment missions, the pre-accession economic programme, fiscal notifications and, when necessary, early warning letters to the Croatian authorities. In the autumn of 2011, the Commission shall present a Progress Report to the European Parliament and the Council. In the autumn of 2012, it shall present a Comprehensive Monitoring Report to the European Parliament and the Council. Throughout the monitoring process, the Commission shall also draw on input from Member States and take into consideration input from international and civil society organisations as appropriate.\n\nThe Commission's monitoring shall focus in particular on commitments undertaken by Croatia in the area of the judiciary and fundamental rights (Annex VII), including the continued development of track records on judicial reform and efficiency, impartial handling of war crimes cases, and the fight against corruption.\n\nIn addition, the Commission's monitoring shall focus on the area of freedom, security and justice, including the implementation and enforcement of Union requirements with respect to external border management, police cooperation, the fight against organised crime, and judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, as well as on commitments in the area of competition policy, including the restructuring of the shipbuilding industry (Annex VIII) and of the steel sector (Annex IX).\n\nAs an integral part of its regular monitoring tables and reports, the Commission shall issue six-monthly assessments up to the accession of Croatia on the commitments undertaken by Croatia in these areas.\n\n2. The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may take all appropriate measures if issues of concern are identified during the monitoring process. The measures shall be maintained no longer than strictly necessary and, in any case, shall be lifted by the Council, acting in accordance with the same procedure, when the relevant issues of concern have been effectively addressed.\n\n1. If, until the end of a period of up to three years after accession, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, Croatia may apply for authorisation to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector concerned to the economy of the internal market.\n\nIn the same circumstances, any present Member State may apply for authorisation to take protective measures with regard to Croatia.\n\n2. Upon request by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, determine the protective measures which it considers necessary, specifying the conditions and arrangements applicable thereto.\n\nIn the event of serious economic difficulties and at the express request of the Member State concerned, the Commission shall act within five working days of the receipt of the request accompanied by the relevant background information. The measures thus decided on shall be applicable forthwith, shall take into account the interest of all parties concerned and shall not entail border controls.\n\n3. The measures authorised under this Article may involve derogations from the rules of the TEU, the TFEU and this Act to such an extent and for such periods as are strictly necessary in order to attain the objectives of this safeguard. Priority shall be given to measures which least disturb the functioning of the internal market.\n\nIf Croatia fails to fulfil commitments undertaken in the context of the accession negotiations, including commitments in any sectoral policy which concerns economic activities with a cross-border effect, thereby causing a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market or a threat to the Union's financial interests or an imminent risk of such a breach or threat, the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three years after accession, upon reasoned request of a Member State or on its own initiative, take appropriate measures.\n\nThese measures shall be proportionate and priority shall be given to measures which least disturb the functioning of the internal market and, where appropriate, to the application of the existing sectoral safeguard mechanisms. The safeguard measures under this Article shall not be invoked as a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. The safeguard clause may be invoked even before accession on the basis of the monitoring findings and the measures adopted shall enter into force on the date of accession unless they provide for a later date. The measures shall be maintained no longer than strictly necessary and, in any case, shall be lifted when the relevant commitment has been fulfilled. They may, however, be applied beyond the period referred to in the first paragraph as long as the relevant commitments have not been fulfilled. In response to progress made by Croatia in fulfilling its commitments, the Commission may adapt the measures as appropriate. The Commission shall inform the Council in good time before revoking the safeguard measures, and it shall take duly into account any observations of the Council in this respect.\n\nIf there are serious shortcomings or any imminent risk of such shortcomings in Croatia in the transposition or state of implementation of acts adopted by the institutions pursuant to Part Three, Title V of the TFEU as well as of acts adopted by the institutions before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon pursuant to Title VI of the TEU or pursuant to Part Three, Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Commission may, until the end of a period of up to three years after accession, upon the reasoned request of a Member State or on its own initiative and after consulting the Member States, adopt appropriate measures and specify the conditions and arrangements applicable thereto.\n\nThese measures may take the form of a temporary suspension of the application of relevant provisions and decisions in the relations between Croatia and any other Member State or Member States, without prejudice to the continuation of close judicial cooperation. The safeguard clause may be invoked even before accession on the basis of the monitoring findings and the measures adopted shall enter into force on the date of accession unless they provide for a later date. The measures shall be maintained no longer than strictly necessary and, in any case, shall be lifted when the shortcomings are remedied. They may, however, be applied beyond the period referred to in the first paragraph as long as these shortcomings persist. In response to progress made by Croatia in rectifying the identified shortcomings, the Commission may adapt the measures as appropriate after consulting the Member States. The Commission shall inform the Council in good time before revoking the safeguard measures, and it shall take duly into account any observations of the Council in this respect.\n\nIn order not to hamper the proper functioning of the internal market, the enforcement of Croatia's national rules during the transitional periods referred to in Annex V shall not lead to border controls between Member States.\n\nIf transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the existing regime in Croatia to that resulting from the application of the common agricultural policy under the conditions set out in this Act, they shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 195(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) [13] in conjunction with Article 13(1)(b) of European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 [14] or the relevant procedure as determined in the applicable legislation. They may be adopted within a period of three years from the date of accession and their application shall be limited to that period. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may extend this period.\n\nTransitional measures referred to in the first paragraph may also be adopted prior to the date of accession, if necessary. Such measures shall be adopted by the Council acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission or, where they affect instruments initially adopted by the Commission, they shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedures required for adopting the instruments in question.\n\nIf transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the existing regime in Croatia to that resulting from the application of the Union veterinary, phytosanitary and food safety rules, such measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the relevant procedure as determined in the applicable legislation. These measures shall be adopted within a period of three years from the date of accession and their application shall be limited to that period.\n\nThe Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall define the terms under which:\n\n(a) the requirement for an exit summary declaration may be waived for the products referred to in Article 28(2) of the TFEU leaving the territory of Croatia to cross the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum (\"Neum corridor\");\n\n(b) the requirement for an entry summary declaration may be waived for the products falling within the scope of point (a) when they re-enter the territory of Croatia after having crossed the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum.\n\nThe Commission may take all appropriate measures to ensure that the necessary statutory staff is maintained in Croatia for a maximum of 18 months following accession. During this period, officials, temporary staff and contract staff assigned to posts in Croatia before accession and who are required to remain in service in Croatia after the date of accession shall benefit from the same financial and material conditions as were applied before accession in accordance with the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 [15]. The administrative expenditure, including salaries for other necessary staff, shall be covered by the general budget of the European Union.\n\nTITLE I\n\nADAPTATIONS TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND TO THE RULES AND RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEES\n\nThe institutions shall, in accordance with the respective procedures provided for in the original Treaties, make such adaptations to their Rules of Procedure as are rendered necessary by accession.\n\nAdaptations to the rules of the Committees established by the original Treaties and to their Rules of Procedure which are rendered necessary by accession shall be made as soon as possible after accession.\n\nTITLE II\n\nAPPLICABILITY OF THE ACTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS\n\nUpon accession, Croatia shall be considered as being an addressee, in accordance with the original Treaties, of directives and decisions within the meaning of Article 288 of the TFEU. Except with regard to directives and decisions which have entered into force pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 297(1) and the second subparagraph of Article 297(2) of the TFEU, Croatia shall be considered as having received notification of such directives and decisions upon accession.\n\n1. Croatia shall put into effect the measures necessary for it to comply, from the date of accession, with the provisions of directives and decisions within the meaning of Article 288 of the TFEU, unless another time limit is provided for in this Act. Croatia shall communicate those measures to the Commission by the date of accession or, where later, by the time limit provided for in this Act.\n\n2. To the extent that amendments to directives within the meaning of Article 288 of the TFEU introduced by this Act require modification of the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the present Member States, the present Member States shall put into effect the measures necessary to comply, from the date of accession of Croatia, with the amended directives, unless another time limit is provided for in this Act. They shall communicate those measures to the Commission by the date of accession or, where later, by the time limit provided for in this Act.\n\nProvisions laid down by legislation, regulation or administrative action designed to ensure the protection of the health of workers and the general public in the territory of Croatia against the dangers arising from ionising radiations shall, in accordance with Article 33 of the EAEC Treaty, be communicated by Croatia to the Commission within three months from accession.\n\nAt the duly substantiated request of Croatia, submitted to the Commission no later than the date of accession, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, or the Commission, if the original act was adopted by the Commission, may take measures consisting of temporary derogations from acts adopted by the institutions between 1 July 2011 and the date of accession. The measures shall be adopted according to the voting rules governing the adoption of the act from which a temporary derogation is sought. Where those derogations are adopted after accession, they may be applied as of the date of accession.\n\nWhere acts of the institutions adopted prior to accession require adaptation by reason of accession, and the necessary adaptations have not been provided for in this Act or its Annexes, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, or the Commission, if the original act was adopted by the Commission, shall, to this end, adopt the necessary acts. Where those acts are adopted after accession, they may be applied as of the date of accession.\n\nUnless otherwise stipulated in this Act, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt the necessary measures to implement the provisions of this Act.\n\nThe texts of the acts of the institutions adopted before accession and drawn up by these institutions in the Croatian language shall, from the date of accession, be authentic under the same conditions as the texts drawn up in the present official languages. They shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union if the texts in the present official languages were so published.\n\nTITLE III\n\nFINAL PROVISIONS\n\nAnnexes I to IX, the Appendices thereto and the Protocol are an integral part of this Act.\n\nThe Government of the Italian Republic shall transmit to the Government of the Republic of Croatia a certified copy of the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and the Treaties amending or supplementing them, including the Treaty concerning the accession of the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Treaty concerning the accession of the Hellenic Republic, the Treaty concerning the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, the Treaty concerning the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania, in the Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish languages.\n\nThe texts of the Treaties referred to in the first paragraph, drawn up in the Croatian language, shall be annexed to this Act.
