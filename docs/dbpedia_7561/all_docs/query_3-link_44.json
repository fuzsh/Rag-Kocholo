        "text": "Key background\n\nEarly national parliamentary elections in April 2024 saw the long-dominant centre-right HDZ party win most seats in parliament but fall short of an outright majority. In the new coalition between HDZ and the Homeland Movement, a new Ministry of Environmental Protection and Green Transition has been established, led by former Agriculture Minister Marija Vučković. This ministry aims to drive the green transition and sustainable development but concerns about the efficiency of this change persist, especially with key sectors like energy and economy under the Homeland Movement. Energy sector stakeholders emphasize that effective inter-ministerial collaboration and addressing administrative delays in renewable energy project approvals are crucial.\n\nThanks mainly to its large hydropower plants, Croatia has a significant share of renewable energy in electricity production. Due to persistent rainy weather, in the first five months of 2023 the share stood at 75.9 percent. In January 2024, renewable energy sources produced more electricity than thermal power plants and from the Croatian part of the nuclear powerplant Krško. For 4 days in December 2023, the country was powered entirely by renewable energy sources.\n\nAs hydropower is an extremely variable energy source, the country also has to depend on its thermal power plants or on energy imports. In 2022, when rainfall was much lower, the share of hydropower in energy production was 25 percent.\n\nCroatia currently imports energy (100 percent of its coal, 40 percent of gas and 80 percent of oil needs) and has been particularly vulnerable to the rise in fossil fuel prices.\n\nIn 2021, approximated domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia were 23.3 MtCO2-eq, 2.1 percent lower compared to 2020 and 5.6 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, net domestic emissions, including the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, were 41.9 percent lower than in 1990.\n\nCroatia’s 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan aims at a 36.4 percent share of renewable energy by 2030 and a 45 percent drop in emissions. The plan is currently being updated with new targets.\n\nCroatia is among the EU member states highly vulnerable to climate risks. Nearly a quarter of the economy is based on sectors potentially vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather, including agriculture and tourism.\n\nThe country invests in gas infrastructure, aiming to be a regional hub for U.S. gas imports. An investment totalling 180 million euros in expanding the capacity of the LNG terminal on the island of Krk is planned along with the building of a new gas pipeline.\n\nMajor transition stories\n\nEnergy independent islands – In 2020, Croatia initiated the signing of the Memorandum of Split (memorandum of understanding implementing the Valletta Political Declaration on Clean Energy for European Union Islands), which aims to improve the energy transition on the islands. The document ensures detailed support to the islands in preparing their strategies for the process of transition to clean energy and cooperation of energy communities on the islands. The biggest island in Croatia, Krk, has been aiming to become one of the first energy independent and CO2 neutral islands in the Mediterranean.\n\nHydrogen Valley – Croatia is part of the North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project with Slovenia and Italy. The project started in September 2023 and features 17 pilot projects for the production of more than 5,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year from renewable energy sources and its storage, distribution and use.\n\nUse of geothermal energy – Northern Croatia is abundant with geothermal energy, a potential which has so far been scarcely used but the energy crisis has enticed many local communities to start local projects, which are mostly in research phases. For example, Bjelovar plans to heat the whole town with geothermal energy.\n\nSolar potential – The country has one of the highest insulations in the EU, between 2,000 and 2,700 hours of sunshine a year. According to analysts from the association SolarPower Europe, Croatia has the potential and opportunity to install up to 7 GW of solar power by 2030 (a few hundred MW installed today). Although 2023 was marked by the increased construction of solar power plants, on 1 January, 2024 Croatia still had only 462.5 MW of installed power of solar power plants in operation. One of the reasons is that Croatia is the slowest among the 12 European Union member countries in Ember’s recent report in permitting onshore wind and solar projects.\n\nElectrification of marine transport – Croatia used to have an important shipbuilding industry, and now starts building electric marine vehicles. A zero emission passenger sailing ship is being built in Split. iCat company is producing solar electric catamarans. Pearlsea Yachts is producing the country’s first electric speedboat. Jadroplov company has designed one of the largest ferries in the Adriatic, which would be able to transport a thousand passengers and 400 vehicles on electric power if they are able to resolve financing.\n\nEnergy storage in development - Croatia’s first large battery energy storage system was supposed to be built in Šibenik by 2024. The project, subsidised by EU funds and supposed to be the biggest in South East Europe, has not yet been completed despite the announcements.\n\nSector overview"
