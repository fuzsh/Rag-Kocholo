        "text": "World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nWHO was founded in 1948 to work for the attainment of the highest possible level of health by all peoples. WHO works with 194 Member States, providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, and articulating evidence-based policy options. It also provides technical support to Member States, monitors and assesses health trends, funds medical research and provides emergency aid during disasters. Through its programmes, WHO also works to improve nutrition, housing, sanitation and working conditions around the world. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and has six regional offices around the world.\n\nThe European Region (WHO/Europe)\n\nWHO/Europe is one of WHO’s six regional offices around the world. It serves the WHO European Region, which comprises 53 countries, covering a vast geographical region from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. WHO/Europe staff are public health, scientific and technical experts, based in the main office in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 7 technical centres and in country offices in 30 Member States (plus one planned). In addition, WHO/Europe coordinates with the European Union and its agencies, and is host organization and partner of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.\n\nThe WHO Country Office\n\nThe WHO Country Office, Croatia was established in Zagreb in November 1992 to respond to requests from the host country to support policy-making on sustainable health development, taking a holistic health-system approach. This includes providing guidance, building up local relationships to implement technical cooperation, standards and agreements, and, during crises, ensuring that public health measures are coordinated and in place.\n\nThe Office is the focal point for WHO activities in Croatia. The country team consists of two staff members and its main responsibilities are:\n\nto assess the country’s health needs and priorities, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare;\n\nto help identify priority areas for WHO collaboration and implement WHO policy in the country;\n\nto monitor implementation of the biennial collaborative agreements between WHO/Europe and Croatia;\n\nto coordinate WHO input to the national health authorities; and to liaise with WHO collaborating centres and projects, and with other United Nations and international agencies.\n\nThe priorities for the Country Office are set out in the biennial collaborative agreement between WHO/Europe and the host country. The Office implements the agreement in close collaboration with national institutions and international partner agencies.\n\nRegions for Health Network (RHN)\n\nSince 1993, the WHO European Regions for Health Network (RHN) has helped regions to accelerate the delivery of improved population health. RHN is committed to the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), 2020 –2025.The Network is instrumental in efforts “to support local living environments that enable health and well-being”."
