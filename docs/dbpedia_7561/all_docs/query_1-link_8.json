        "text": "ELA‚Äôs Executive Director, Cosmin Boiangiu, this morning in his speech at the ‚ÄúSkills, skills, skills!‚Äù event, that took place in the European Parliament: üó£ ‚ÄúCross-border labour mobility is not the silver bullet to solve labour markets imbalances, but it does contribute sensibly to a well-functioning EU Single Market‚Äù üó£ ‚ÄúELA‚Äôs ambition is to use the full potential of EURES, in particular through better matching of jobs with skills, and more dynamic targeting of labour shortages and surpluses. We will do so in cooperation with the European Commission, other EU agencies and institutions, Member States and social partners, aiming at more effective labour mobility.\" More information üîó https://europa.eu/!wFDqNY #EULabourAuthority #EuropeanYearOfSkills\n\n2024 is the biggest election year in the history. In 2024, more than 60 countries representing half of world's population-4 billion people will go to the polls. Only 30 percent of world's population believe their voice matters. People want their governments to rewrite economic rules to promote growth and shared prosperity. Circumstantially, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) General Council has approved a proposal to put the defence and promotion of democracy at the centre of ITUC action in 2024 and beyond. Trade unions can play a crucial role in defending and promoting democracy. It is thus imperative for countries like Pakistan to jack up the trade unions density from the current rate of below 5 percent to at least above 50 percent. #pakistan #pakistanelections2024 #democracy #humanrights International Trade Union Confederation - ITUC International Labour Organization\n\nDanish Trade Union Development Agency ‚Äì Copenhagen ‚Äì Denmark The Danish Trade Union Development Agency (DTDA) is the Danish trade union movement's organisation for international development cooperation. It was established in 1987 by the two largest Danish confederations, the Danish Federation of Trade Unions (LO) and the Danish Confederation of Salaried Employees and Civil Servants (FTF), now merged to the Danish Trade Union Confederation (FH). The Danish Trade Union Development Agency does not have individual members but the unions affiliated to FH have more than 1,400,000 members. The support from members is guaranteed through the well-established democratic structures in the Danish trade union movement. The Danish Trade Union Development Agency contributes to the creation of fair democratic, social and economic conditions for all in developing countries through the development of sustainable labour markets with https://lnkd.in/dFKizZ33 #GOVERNMENTDEPIOI #PUBLICAGENCIESFORINVESTMENTTRADE\n\nTrade unions are calling for the European Union‚Äôs social and labour standards to be fully upheld in negotiations on the accession of Ukraine, Moldova and Montenegro. Trade unions want the accession of Ukraine, Moldova and Montenegro to be a success for working people in these countries themselves as well as for those in existing members of the European Union. That means the EU‚Äôs social and labour standards must be fully upheld in accession talks, with no partial access to the single market until countries have reached the required standards. https://lnkd.in/guU_GCFs\n\n## Forced Labour Regulation ## AgenceEurope reporting today that Coreper may reach Political Agreement on a compromise text of the proposed Forced Labour Regulation tomorrow, Friday 19 January. Key changes as compared to EC proposal: - role of EC in decision-making which now foresees a leading role for Commission in the investigation process). Difference with EP position: - no principle of reparation or compensation mechanism for victims of forced labour foreseen by Council. Next steps: - following an eventual Political Agreement interinstitutional negotiations (trilogue) may start as soon as the end of January, with the objective of having an agreement before the end of the Belgian Presidency.\n\nBongani Luthuli from Cowan-Harper-Madikizela will be speaking at the 6th African Labour Law Society Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa on 1-2 August 2024. Register Now: https://lnkd.in/dtKbrSuQ ‚ÑπÔ∏è Abstract Does the Labour Court have jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between a South African employer and a South African employee in a foreign country? This presentation will look at this question in light of globalization and the increase of South Africans working outside South Africa. The discussion will centre around Kleynhans v Parmalat SA (Pty) Ltd (2002) 9 BLLR 879 (LC) and Parry v Astral Operations (2005) 26 ILJ 1479 (LC). It will be submitted that the Labour Court in these decisions held that it did have jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes where the workplace is outside South Africa provided that certain requirements were met. In Astral Operations Limited v Parry (2008) 29 ILJ 2668 (LAC), the Labour Appeal overturned the decision of the Labour Court and reasoned that both the Labour Relations Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act do not have extra-territorial application in terms of the presumption against extraterritoriality and that the workplace was outside South Africa. The Labour Court which was created by these two acts, did not give it jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. This paper will discuss these decisions and submit, with respect, that the Labour Appeal Court‚Äôs decision was not in line with globalization and missed the opportunity to advance protection for employees working outside South Africa. The positions in European Union, the United Kingdom and Ontario, Canada. We will call for legislative reform for the abolishment of the presumption against extra-territorial application of the Labour Relations Act in order to allow South African employers and employees to engage outside the borders of South Africa whilst enjoying the constitutional protection of the right to fair labour practices enshrined in Section 23 of the Constitution. #ALLS2024 #ALLS #labourlaw #conference #johannesburg"
