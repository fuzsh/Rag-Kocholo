The Republic of Croatia is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia. It has a population of 4.28 million. Its capital is Zagreb. A unitary state, Croatia is a republic governed under a parliamentary system.

On 25 June 1991 Croatia declared independence, which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year.

Croatia is a member of the European Union, United Nations, the Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade Organization and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean.

Croatia applied for EU membership in 2003 and was in negotiations from 2005 until 2011.

On 9 December 2011 leaders from the EU and Croatia signed the accession treaty. The country became the 28th EU member country on 1 July 2013.

Throughout the interim period until accession, Croatia as an acceding country already had active observer status in the European institutions, which allowed it to become familiar with the working methods of the EU institutions and to be involved in the decision-making process.
