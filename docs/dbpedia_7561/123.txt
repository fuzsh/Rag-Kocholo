The Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Union, its Member States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was signed on 15 December 2010.

The Republic of Croatia acceded to the European Union on 1 July 2013. Pursuant to Article 6(2) of the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession, Croatia undertook to accede to the agreements concluded or signed by the Member States and the Union with one or more third countries or an international organisation.

A Protocol should therefore be signed. The Protocol provides for the necessary linguistic adaptations of the Agreement that ensue from the accession of Croatia.
