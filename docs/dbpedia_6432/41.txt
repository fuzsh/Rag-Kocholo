Bury the Hatchet is a storyline mission in GTA V that can be played as either Michael or Trevor. In this mission, Trevor travels to North Yankton to find out who was really buried in Michael’s fake grave. Suddenly Michael and Trevor find themselves pointing guns at each other when they are interrupted by Wei Cheng's men who are looking for Trevor.

At the start of this mission, Trevor is seen visiting Michael at the De Santa residence. Michael is seen sitting on his couch in the living room while Trevor walks in and takes a seat next to him. Soon an argument breaks out and Michael, when questioned about who actually was buried in his fake grave, has no answer. Trevor figures that his suspicions about Brad are true after all and leaves for Sandy Shores airfield to fly to Ludendorff himself and confirm the truth.

Trevor takes Michael’s car and drives away. Michael then goes to Los Santos International Airport and also flies to North Yankton. At the airport Wei Cheng’s men who had been following Trevor, follow Michael instead. Trevor reaches the graveyard in Ludendorff and searches for Michael Townley’s grave.

Once he finds Michael’s grave he starts digging it up. Soon Michael reaches North yankton as well and drives to the cemetery. He finds Trevor digging up his grave and tries to convince him for one last time that he isn’t going to find anything. Soon Trevor reaches the casket and busts open a hole near the top part through which he sees the face of the person buried. He realizes it was Brad from his golden tooth and Trevor and Michael soon find themselves pointing guns at each other.

At this point Wei Cheng’s men interrupt and Trevor runs away. Cheng’s men think Michael is Trevor’s boyfriend/lover and plan to kidnap him instead. Michael gets stuck at the cemetery and tries to make his way out to his car. Unfortunately Cheng’s men get a hold of him.
