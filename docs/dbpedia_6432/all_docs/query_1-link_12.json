        "text": "Rob Zombie and legendary director John Carpenter have \"buried the hatchet\" after Carpenter blasted Zombie for allegedly \"lying\" to him about Rob's 2007 remake of Carpenter's 1978 horror classic \"Halloween\".\n\nAccording to The Pulse Of Radio, Carpenter said at the New York Film Academy last April that he disliked Zombie's \"Halloween\", adding that Rob was dishonest when he said that Carpenter never gave him his blessing to tackle the remake in the first place.\n\nCarpenter explained: \"He lied about me. He said I was very cold to him when he told me he was going to make it. Nothing could be further from the truth. I said, 'Make it your own movie, man. This is yours now. Don't worry about me.' I was incredibly supportive. Why that piece of shit lied, I don't know.\"\n\nCarpenter said about Zombie's film itself: \"I thought he took away the mystique of the story by explaining too much about [serial killer Michael Myers].\"\n\nOn Tuesday, September 27, Carpenter tweeted that he reconnected with Zombie and that the two have made up. He wrote: \"To everyone fascinated with the JC/RZ feud, old news. We spoke Sunday, we buried the hatchet. Let's move on.\"\n\nZombie's version of \"Halloween\" was reviewed poorly by critics but made nearly $60 million at the box office, leading to a Zombie-directed sequel in 2009.\n\nZombie said that he had to rush to finish both \"Halloween\" films to meet a studio release date. \"The post-production was so short, because with those movies being big studio pictures, they locked in a release date that I had to meet,\" he told The Pulse Of Radio. \"But the release date was so insane, where, 'Okay, you're gonna start shooting in February and we want it in theaters in August.' And you're like, 'Ai-yi-yi,' you know.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Carpenter himself is executive producing yet another reboot of \"Halloween\", although further details on that have yet to be unveiled.\n\nZombie's latest movie, \"31\", recently premiered on digital outlets and VOD and will begin a limited theatrical run on October 21.\n\nThe film follows five carnival workers who are kidnapped and taken to an compound where they are forced to participate in a violent game and survive 12 hours against a gang of sadistic clowns."
