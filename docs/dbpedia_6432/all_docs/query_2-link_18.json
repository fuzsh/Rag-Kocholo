        "text": "A play about two brothers, Niv and Sai, heading to the mountains to bury the hatchet on a lifelong rivalry.\n\nBig brother Niv has gone vegan. He’s madly in love, he's starting his own business, and seems to have finally found himself after years as the black sheep of the family. In an attempt to reconcile their differences, Niv invites golden child Sai and his new girlfriend Kate on a ski trip where they can put the past aside for the sake of family. But when party banter turns political, Kate stumbles into a minefield, and finds herself the focal point of an all-out war.\n\nThis original comedy by Aran Thangaratnam stars Green Room Award-winning Dushan Phillips (Red Stitch Actors' Ensemble) and newcomer Kaivu Suvarna. Funny and feisty, it's all about the bitter warfare behind brotherly love.\n\nContent warning: includes themes of racism, references to genocide, drug use and occasional coarse language.\n\n★★★★ \"This sharp, authentic comedy gives Australia’s woke generation a voice” — The Age\n\n★★★★ “A crowd-pleasing ripper” — TimeOut\n\n“Humorous, thought-provoking theatre” — Limelight\n\nStep into a trendy chalet in Mount Buller with Matilda Woodroofe's epic set design! Yes, that is falling snow you see above. As well as it's impressive design, Stay Woke received rave reviews during its premiere season at Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, with critics praising its ability to tackle complex issues around white privilege and colonialism, while simultaneously giving audiences a good belly laugh:\n\n\"Far from a deep dive on these issues, it’s a smart move by Thangaratnam to broach dismantling systems of oppression via comic relief in Stay Woke\", Stephen A Russell, Time Out.\n\nAnd we have an incredible team of Community Engagement specialists who have bought an authentic Sri Lankan experience to the show. Our foyer is transformed into a traditional Tamil living room circa 1990s so you feel like you've just stepped inside Niv and Sai's childhood home.\n\nPlus we're bringing the vibes on Saturday 2 and 16 April with Short Eatz. During Short Eatz, audiences will be served tasty treats (think palaharam) and experience homegrown Tamil Artists and DJs in the foyer for a post-show dance party (free with your show ticket)."
