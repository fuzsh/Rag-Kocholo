        "text": "Ever wonder why there was no Wayne's World 3? Part of the reason could be the lackluster box office totals for Wayne's World 2, but it could also be blamed on the rift that formed between star Mike Meyers, his co-star Dana Carvey and Wayne's World director Penelope Spheeris. Despite the first film's happy-go-lucky vibe, there were squabbles behind-the-scenes. But years later, this is all just water under the bridge, and now the three will reunite for a Wayne's World panel on April 23 at the Academy's Wilshire Boulevard headquarters.\n\nSpeaking with THR about the event, Spheeris said:\n\nBut what was the brouhaha all about? Reportedly Myers and Spheeris fought over the film's final cut, with her often rejecting his suggestions. To her credit, her version scored well with test audiences, and went on to be a beloved box office hit. Still, when it came time to make a sequel, the spurned Meyers pushed Spheeris out of consideration for the director's chair. Instead, Stephen Surjik helmed Wayne's World 2, which barely broke even at the domestic box office and was less loved by critics. Spheeris went on to helm such bubbly comedies as The Beverly Hillbillies, The Little Rascals and Black Sheep."
