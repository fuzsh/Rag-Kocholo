        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - There’s a reason Cinderella is a classic — and a new holiday movie puts a modern twist on the old-fashioned tale!\n\nWriter and former radio personality from V-103, Ramona DeBreaux Overstreet, and actors Brad James and Erica Hubbard came to Atlanta News First to talk about “He Who Findeth: A Cinderella Christmas Tale.” The movie took Overstreet 10 years to write, and the actors made the characters jump off the page, she said.\n\nOn Friday at 7:30 p.m., Tara Theatre will host a red carpet premiere followed by a Q&A with the film’s stars. You can watch the movie on Mansa, a free streaming platform featuring Black creators and stories. It will also be available on Tubi starting Dec. 15.\n\nCopyright 2023 WANF. All rights reserved."
