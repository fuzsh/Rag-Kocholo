        "text": "blazing-saddles-480.jpg\n\nCleavon Little in \"Blazing Saddles\"\n\nPICK OF THE WEEK:\n\nIt's a slow week for new movies on disc, but even if it weren't, a new collector's edition of what director Mel Brooks calls, with understandable pride, \"the funniest movie ever made\" would still be cause for celebration.\n\nFour decades before Brooks skewered Hollywood Westerns, there were great American film comedies, and four decades later, there still are. But \"Blazing Saddles\" feels like an apex of sorts, using slapstick, offensive language (caution: n-words aplenty), and silly names to drive home what's ultimately a radical critique of American mythmaking. Although co-writer Richard Pryor (the unsung genius of the film) was originally slated to play Black Bart, the African American sheriff of virulently racist frontier town Rock Ridge, it's hard to imagine anyone better than Cleavon Little in the role.\n\nThe rest of the cast is a collection of some of the great hams in film history: Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Gene Wilder and the great Madeline Kahn. If there's anything sobering about \"Blazing Saddles,\" it's being reminded of the premature deaths of both Little (at 53) and Kahn (57). In fact, of the movie's primary actors, only Wilder, 80, and Brooks, 87, are still alive. Forty years is a long time.\n\nOther than a new half-hour featurette, comprised mainly of an interview with Brooks, and ten \"collectible art cards,\" there isn't anything new on this release. (Brooks' commentary, some deleted scenes, and the pilot episode of the ill-considered spinoff TV series \"Black Bart\" are held over from the previous Blu-ray edition.) But the film, shot in widescreen and Technicolor, looks great in high definition, and it's a must-have for anybody who's truly serious about comedy.\n\n(1974, 93 minutes, rated R, $24.98 Blu-ray)\n\nALSO RECOMMENDED:\n\n\"Veronica Mars\" The fan-funded big-screen adaptation of the cult TV series brings the erstwhile teen sleuth (Kristen Bell) back to her hometown of Neptune, California, for one more case.\n\nALSO OF NOTE:\n\n\"The Art of the Steal\" Kurt Russell and Matt Dillon play half-brothers and rival art thieves who team up for (everybody with me now...) one last job.\n\n\"Awful Nice\" Another movie about estranged male siblings, these two trying to bury the hatchet long enough to spruce up their dead dad's lake house.\n\n\"Brownian Movement\" A Belgian couple's marriage is tested after revelations of infidelity in this provocative drama.\n\n\"Death Occurred Last Night\" A grieving father seeks vengeance on his daughter's killers in this 1970 Italian thriller.\n\n\"Generation War\" This epic German miniseries follows a group of friends swept up in their nation's descent into Nazi madness and destruction.\n\n\"Still Mine\" An elderly Canadian farmer (James Cromwell) is opposed by local authorities when he tries to build a home for him and his wife (Genevi√®ve Bujold).\n\nNEW TO BLU-RAY:\n\n\"Ace in the Hole\" (D: Billy Wilder, 1951); \"Amistad (D: Steve Spielberg, 1997); \"Bachelor Party\" (Tom Hanks, 1984); \"The Big Red One\" (D: Samuel Fuller, 1980; original cut); \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (D: Clint Eastwood, 1995); \"The Deep End\" (Tilda Swinton, 1992); \"Porky's\" (D: Bob Clark, 1982); \"Revenge of the Nerds\" (1984); \"The Terminal\" (D: Steven Spielberg); \"Weekend at Bernie's\" (1989); \"The Women\" (D: George Cukor, 1939)"
