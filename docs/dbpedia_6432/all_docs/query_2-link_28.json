        "text": "“Succession” was — in a shock to no one — a huge winner at the 75th annual Primetime Emmy Awards on Monday night.\n\nBest-actor winner Kieran Culkin choked up onstage as he thanked his mom while accepting the award… and then propositioned his wife.\n\n“And Jazz — I want more,” Culkin said to Jazz Charton, his wife of more than a decade, as she sat in the audience, cracking up along with what sounded like everyone else in the room. (The couple are already parents to two young daughters.)\n\n“You said maybe, if I win.”\n\nOverall, the Emmys were, in a word: nostalgic. We lost count of how many cast reunions took place throughout the three-hour ceremony, tbh. (See: “Cheers,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Sopranos,” and “Mean Girls” — kinda.)\n\nEarlier in the night, Sir Elton John reached a huge career milestone, securing EGOT status by scoring his first Emmy — and he wasn’t even in the room.\n\nThis live blog has ended.\n\nHere’s what happened at the 2024 Emmys"
