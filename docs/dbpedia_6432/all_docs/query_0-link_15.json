It was the top documentary in the end-of-the-year national critics’ polls for both IndieWire and the Village Voice, and recently was awarded the duPont-Columbia Journalism Award and an EmmyÂ®.\n\nMuseum Hours\n\nThursday, April 24, 1:00pm\n\nJEM COHEN's feature-length films include Chain, Benjamin Smoke, Instrument and Evening’s Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin. His shorts include Lost Book Found, Amber City, Little Flags and Anne Truitt, Working. A New-York based filmmaker, his films are in the collections of NYCs Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum and have been broadcast by PBS, Arte and the Sundance Channel. He’s had retrospectives at London’s NFT, BAFICI, Oberhausen, Gijon, and Spain’s Punto de Vista.\n\nRecent projects include the Gravity Hill Newsreels (about Occupy Wall Street) and We Have an Anchor, a portrait of Cape Breton. He has collaborated with musicians including Fugazi, Patti Smith, Terry Riley, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Gil Shaham/Orpheus Orchestra, R.E.M., Vic Chesnutt, and the Ex, as well as with writer Luc Sante.\n\nShort Term 12\n\nThursday, April 24, 4:00pm\n\nBRIE LARSON has built an impressive career as one of the more versatile young actresses working today. Her performance as Grace, the director of a foster care facility, in Short Term 12, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, garnered numerous 2014 best actress nominations. Her best actress wins included the Locarno Film Festival and the Gotham Awards, and she was nominated for a 2014 Critic’s Choice Award.\n\nThe LA Times labeled her the “It Girl” of this year’s SXSWÂ® film festival with four films showing. In addition to Short Term 12 (which took home the Grand Jury prize and the Audience Award), she had supporting roles in The Spectacular Now, as well as Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s directorial debut. Both films were also at Sundance and SXSX. Last year she was seen in 21 Jump Street, and received rave reviews for her supporting role in Oren Moverman’s Rampart. Up next, Larson will star in The Gambler, slated to release in 2015. Larson is still widely recognized for her portrayal of Kate, Toni Collette’s sarcastic and rebellious daughter, in Showtime’s United States of Tara. Other notable credits include Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and Noah Baumbach’s Greenberg. She has appeared on stage at the prestigious Williamstown Theater Festival in the role of Emily in Our Town, and recurred on the F/X cult favorite series, The League.\n\nIn addition to acting, Larson is a writer and director. Her short film, The Arm won the prize for Best Comedic Storytelling at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. The other Weighting was in competition at this year’s SXSWÂ® film festival.\n\nA native of Sacramento, Larson started studying drama at the early age of 6, as the youngest student ever to attend the ACT San Francisco. Larson currently resides in LA.\n\nKEITH STANFIELD delivers a breakthrough performance in Short Term 12, written/directed by Destin Cretton, which premiered at SXSWÂ® and won Audience and Grand Jury awards for best narrative feature. Stanfield plays Marcus, a teenager faced with the imminent threat of out-aging the foster system that the film is set in. Stanfield earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his role.\n\nStanfield's first on-camera role was in the short-film version of Short Term 12, which premiered at Sundance 2008 and led to the feature film. After an audition in Cretton's own living room that left the young writer/director in tears, Stanfield was the only actor from the short film that was asked to reprise his role in the feature film. As evidenced by a scene in the film where Marcus opens up for the first time through a rap song that Stanfield and Cretton co-wrote, Stanfield is also a talented vocalist who raps in the group Moors.\n\nStanfield currently resides in the LA area and will be seen in Purge: Anarchy and in James Franco's Memoria.\n\nYoung Adult\n\nThursday, April 24, 7:00pm\n\nPATTON OSWALT continues to find success in all areas of entertainment, from his GrammyÂ®-nominated comedy specials to many memorable guest roles on his favorite TV shows (including Parks and Recreation, for which he received a TV Critics Choice Award); to The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; and his starring role on Adult Swim’s The Heart, She Holler.

Working with an outrageous assemblage of peculiar objects, they thrash and grind soulful music from unlikely sources. Performing at prestigious film festivals and cultural centers in the US and abroad (The Telluride Film Festival, The Louvre, Lincoln Center, The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the National Gallery of Art and others), the Alloy Orchestra has helped revive some of the great masterpieces of the silent era.\n\nAn unusual combination of found percussion and state-of-the-art electronics gives the Orchestra the ability to create any sound imaginable. Utilizing their famous \"rack of junk\" and electronic synthesizers, the group generates beautiful music in a spectacular variety of styles. They can conjure up a simple German bar band of the 1920s or a French symphony. The group can make the audience think it is being attacked by tigers, contacted by radio signals from Mars or swept up in the Russian Revolution.\n\nTerry Donahue (junk percussion, accordion, musical saw and banjo), Roger Miller (synthesizer, percussion) and Ken Winokur (director, junk percussion and clarinet).\n\nCapote\n\nFriday, April 25, 4:00pm\n\nBENNETT MILLER is an Academy AwardÂ® nominated film director and producer best known for Moneyball and Capote.\n\nMiller’s most recent feature, Foxcatcher, tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and the self-destructive spiral he is driven to after moving to the estate of eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Based on actual events, Foxcatcher is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pin their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness.\n\nMoneyball (2011) chronicles the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics baseball team and its general manager Billy Beane. The film received substantial critical praise, and went on to receive 6 Academy AwardÂ® nominations, 4 Golden GlobeÂ® nominations, and 2 Screen Actors Guild awards nominations, in addition to nominations from AFI, BAFTA, PGA and WGA.\n\nMiller earned an Academy AwardÂ® nomination for Best Director for the 2005 drama Capote, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman in his OscarÂ®-winning performance as Truman Capote during the research of his groundbreaking true crime novel, In Cold Blood. For Capote, Miller also earned a nomination for BAFTAs David Lean award for direction, and a Directors Guild of America nomination for outstanding feature directorial achievement.\n\nMiller made the acclaimed 1998 documentary-portrait The Cruise about New York City tour guide Timothy “Speed” Levitch. The film garnered considerable critical praise and notable awards, including the top prize of the International Forum at the Berlin Film Festival. The film was released theatrically by Artisan Entertainment and was released on DVD by Lions Gate Films.\n\nDo The Right Thing\n\nFriday, April 25, 8:30pm\n\nSPIKE LEE is a writer-director, actor, producer, author and educator who has helped revolutionize modern Black Cinema. Lee is a forerunner in the ‘Do It Yourself’ school of independent film. Lee is currently in post production on the Kickstarter-funded Da Blood of Sweet Jesus.

Lee received a Peabody Award for the Documentary If God is Willing and Da Creek Don’t Rise, which revisits the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast region as residents attempt to rebuild in their cities, while also demanding assistance and accountability from their political leaders. Recent critical and box office successes include such films as Inside Man, 25th Hour, The Original Kings of Comedy, Bamboozled and Summer of Sam. Lee’s films Girl 6, Get on the Bus, Do the Right Thing and Clockers display his ability to showcase a series of outspoken and provocative socio-political critiques that challenge cultural assumptions, not only about race, but also class and gender identity.\n\nLee began teaching a course on filmmaking at Harvard in 1991, and in 1993 he began as a professor at NYUs Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Film Program, where he received his MFA in Film Production. In 2002 he was appointed the Artistic Director of the Graduate Film Program. Lee has combined his extensive creative experience into yet another venture: partnering with DDB Needham, he created Spike/DDB, a full-service advertising agency.\n\nWadjda\n\nSaturday, April 26, 11:00am\n\nHAIFAA AL-MANSOUR is the first female filmmaker of Saudi Arabia and is regarded as one of its most significant cinematic figures. She finished her BA in Literature at the American University in Cairo and completed her MFA in Directing and Film Studies from the University of Sydney.\n\nThe success of her three short films, as well as the international acclaim of her award-winning 2005 documentary Women Without Shadows, influenced a whole new wave of Saudi filmmakers and made the issue of opening cinemas in the Kingdom a front-page discussion. Within the Kingdom, her work is both praised and vilified for encouraging discussion on topics generally considered taboo, like tolerance, the dangers of orthodoxy, and the need for Saudis to take a critical look at their traditional and restrictive culture.\n\nThrough her films and her work in TV and print, Al Mansour is famous for penetrating the wall of silence surrounding the sequestered lives of Saudi women and providing a platform for their unheard voices.\n\nA Simple Life\n\nSaturday, April 26, 2:00pm\n\nANN HUI was born in China in 1947 and moved to Hong Kong when she was still in her youth.

Some have been at deep odds with conventional mythâfilms such as Platoon (1986), the first of three Vietnam films; JFK (1991); Natural Born Killers (1994); Nixon (1995); and World Trade Center (2006).\n\nStone’s films have often reached wide, international audiences and have had significant cultural impact. These include Salvador (1985), deeply critical of the US Government’s involvement in Central America; Wall Street (1987), a critique of America’s new capitalism; Born on the Fourth of July (1989), criticizing US involvement in Vietnam (for which Stone won a third Academy AwardÂ®); and The Doors (1991), about the 1960s and its music.\n\nHis other films include Any Given Sunday (1999), an unconventional view of the world of American sports; an epic historical drama Alexander (2004, Final Cut Version 2007); W. (2008), a satirical view of George W. Bush; and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), a sequel to the original, which deals with the 2008 financial crash.\n\nIn a series of crime-related films, Stone has, in addition to Natural Born Killers, directed U Turn (1997) and Savages (2012), none of them conventional in their approach to their subject.\n\nHis written screenplays, though not directed, gave him an early taste of the controversial nature of his ideas. An uproar greeted Midnight Express (1979), which only grew with Scarface (1983). He also wrote Year of the Dragon (1985) and Conan the Barbarian (1982). He has produced or co-produced a dozen films including The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Joy Luck Club (1993) and Reversal of Fortune (1990).Â\n\nHis documentaries include three on Fidel Castro (Comandante (2003), Looking for Fidel (2004) and Castro in Winter (2012)) and one on South America, South of the Border (2009), prominently featuring Hugo Chavez and six other Presidents in a continent undergoing huge social changes. He also made Persona Non Grata (2003) on Israel-Palestine relations.\n\nHis latest work The Untold History of the United States (Showtime, 2012), five years in the making, is a monumental 10-hour interrogation of the conventional triumphalist narrative of US history.\n\nStone was born September 15, 1946 in NYC.Â He wrote a novel at 19âA Child Night’s Dreamâabout his youth, which was published in 1997 by St. Martin’s Press. He served in the US Army Infantry in Vietnam in 1967-68 and was decorated with the Bronze Star for Valor.Â After returning from Vietnam, he completed his undergraduate studies at NYU Film School in 1971, where he made several short films. He has also worked as a taxi driver, merchant sailor, messenger, advertising salesman, and production assistant on porno films and others.\n\nBayou Maharajah\n\nSunday, April 27, 12:00pm\n\nLILY KEBER is a filmmaker and educator based in New Orleans. A graduate of the University of Georgia, Keber learned filmmaking at the International Film & Television Workshops in Rockport ME. During the summer of 2007, she co-directed Hutto: America's Family Prison, a short film on the Department of Homeland Security's policy of family detention. Keber is a co-founder of New Orleans Video Voices, a women-led media collective dedicated to expanding media literacy across the Gulf Coast. Her work has appeared on Democracy Now!, GritTV with Laura Flanders, Current TV, Electronic Intifada and local PBS programming. Bayou Maharajah is her first feature-length film\n\nNATE KOHN is a professor at the University of Georgia and Associate Director of the George Foster Peabody Awards, considered to be the highest award for electronic media. He is also Festival Director of Roger Ebert's Film Festival, hosted by Chaz Ebert. Dr. Kohn's credits as a producer include the Academy AwardÂ®-nominated Zulu Dawn starring Burt Lancaster and Peter O’Toole; the independent feature Somebodies, which premiered in competition at Sundance 2006; Rain, Bahamas’ first indigenous feature which premiered at Toronto 2008 and on Showtime (2010); the feature film Bottleworld (2010); and the BET television series Somebodies (2008). He is author of Pursuing Hollywood: Seduction, Obsession, Dread (Alta Mira Press, 2006), and he is most recently producer on the feature-length documentary Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker, which premiered at SXSWÂ® 2013.\n\nHENRY BUTLER, considered the premier exponent of the great New Orleans jazz and blues piano tradition, is a ten-time Pinetop Perkins (formerly W.C. Handy) Best Blues Instrumentalist Award nominee. A rich amalgam of jazz, Caribbean, classical, pop, blues and R&B, his music is as excitingly eclectic as that of his New Orleans birthplace. Blinded by glaucoma at birth, Butler has been playing the piano since he was 6, and arranging, composing and performing professionally since he was 12.\n\nButler’s sound has been influenced by the streets (he grew up in the Calliope Projects in New Orleans, has traveled the world, lived on both coasts and in the heartland); by studying with the greats (Alvin Batiste, Sir Roland Hanna, Professor Longhair and James Booker, among others); by institutions (Louisiana School for the Blind, Southern University, Baton Rouge and Michigan State University); and by his willingness to explore new boundaries and take risks. Butler has played almost every major club and festival in the US, as well as venues in Brazil, France, Norway, Italy, Japan, Australia and more. For over 40 years, he has conducted workshops and master classes through the US. He has also developed a camp for blind and visually impaired teen musicians, the subject of the 2010 documentary The Music’s Gonna Get You Through.\n\nButler’s photographs, exploring the sighted world’s relationship with the flat representation image and its power, continue to be exhibited nationally and internationally and to appear in major newspapers across the US. He and his photographic work were featured in the HBO documentary Dark Light: the Art of Blind Photographers.\n\nThe most recent of Butler’s many CDs is PiaNOLA Live, with works pulled from his rich archivesâabout his only possessions that survived Hurrican Katrina, which decimated his home and took his piano, Braille scores and all his recording equipment. Butler can also be heard on recordings by other musicians including Cyndi Lauper, Jeff Golub and Odetta, and on the soundtrack of HBOs TremÃ©, Season 2 (2012). Whether it’s as a soloist or with his blues groups (Henry Butler and the Game Band, and Henry Butler and Jambalaya) or his traditional jazz band (Papa Henry and the Steamin’ Syncopators), you’re in for the ride of a lifetime!"
