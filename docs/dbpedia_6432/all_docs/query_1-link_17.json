        "text": "Self-help groups provide people with spaces to improve themselves and the world around them. Sally’s self-help group has a similar aim: get rid of terrible husbands. Permanently.\n\nSally and three women come together to find out how to protect themselves and their children from their abusive spouses. Sometimes that may mean hiding the body or two With murder, comes friendship.\n\nThe title kind of says it all. Ernest Cunningham does not beat around the bush; everyone including him has murdered people. Family helps family, sometimes. But it’s not a litany of his family’s crimes.\n\nInstead, it focuses on the decision to host a family retreat at a ski resort…that gets snowed in. And then the bodies start to fall. Can Ernest get to the bottom of the murders before he too joins the corpses?\n\nThe second book in the Ernest Cunningham series Everyone on This Train is a Suspect came out last year and Everyone This Christmas Has a Secret is due later this year.\n\nYes, this is the book that inspired this list. Meddelin Chan didn’t want to go on this blind date that her mom had set up. She especially didn’t mean to kill her date when he got handsy. So what do you do?\n\nYou bring in the aunties. But the family is on the verge of a giant billionaire wedding on an island resort where the body is accidentally shipped. Now Meddy has to hide the corpse, take photos…and keep her feet on the ground when she runs into the man who broke her heart.\n\nIt’s the first of three in the Aunties series where book three The Good, the Bad and the Aunties came out in March 2024.\n\nOffing terrible husbands is definitely a popular theme in these books.\n\nExcept Geeta didn’t kill her husband. She doesn’t know what happened to him and that’s fine. People leave her alone. Until other women want Geeta to give them tips…or a hand in taking care of their husbands.\n\nWill Geeta find a graceful way of getting out of this or will she have to bury the hatchet herself?\n\nNo one wants to get an urgent call from their parents that they need to come over immediately. We joke that it’s probably something about dinner or wear to hang a painting but that fear that the worst has happened is always lurking underneath.\n\nThat’s what Penny feared when she got a call. But instead, it was a fear that she didn’t even know she had—her parents had killed someone and needed her help. Well, what else does one do?\n\nThis one is expected to be out on July 4, 2024.\n\nWe’ve all had moments where our words are misconstrued. It can be a silly mix-up or embarrassing. But Finlay’s case is much more challenging. While talking to her agent about the suspense book that won’t write itself, a woman overhears Finlay and thinks that she is a hit woman.\n\nFinlay doesn’t know what to do though the cash would solve her problems - annoying ex-husband who is breathing down her neck and firing their babysitter without asking, as well as being able to pay her bills and keep custody of her children.\n\nBut when the dead body shows up, Finlay finds an expected ally in crime. Will she manage to hide the body, keep the cops off her tail, and outwit the criminal underworld? There are four books and one novella in the series so far.\n\nOf the seven books, this is the most suspenseful and serious one. Four women are having tea in a cafe when a young woman comes in and hides in the bathroom.\n\nWhen an older man comes into the cafe asking if a young woman had come in, all four women just lie. They realize something is up with this young woman and they are going to try to help her. Soon these acquaintances are now partners in crime to kill this horrible abusive man.\n\nTold from shifting perspectives of the four women and the young woman, you get insight into their lives and the dark secrets they hold."
