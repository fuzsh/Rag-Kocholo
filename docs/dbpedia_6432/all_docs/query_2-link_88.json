Reflecting on the amazing 2 seasons I got on this show, it was such a dream come true. So incredibly grateful for this period in my life. So much love to all my big hearted buddies behind the scenes who make the magic happen every week. So many bald caps, so little time. It was a true honor to work with such a talented group of writers and DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE CAST. [heart emojis] Special shout out to my day 1 crew @marcellohdz @internetdevon and @longfellow_michael. Head up and heart out! (sic)\"\n\nMolly made the announcement shortly after Punkie Johnson revealed that she was leaving the iconic TV show.\n\nThe 39-year-old star confirmed the news during a recent comedy show, revealing that she won't return for the 50th season of 'Saturday Night Live'.\n\nPunkie later said in an Instagram video: \"At the end of the show, I opened up the floor for questions, and everything was going fine until somebody asked, ‘What are you looking forward to most next season? I ain’t gonna lie to my friends, so I just said, ‘Oh, I ain’t coming back.'\"\n\nDespite this, Molly insisted that there's \"no bad blood\" between herself and her castmates.\n\nThe TV star - who began her career as a stand-up comedian - explained: \"It’s no bridges burnt. It’s no hard feelings. Bro, I love my people.\""
