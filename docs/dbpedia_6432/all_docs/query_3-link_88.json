        "text": "Tears for Fears sold in excess of 30 million records, had countless hits and were one of Britain's best-loved bands of the post-MTV era.\n\nYet their recent reunion is regarded as one of the most unlikely in pop music history, given that Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith spent more than a decade barely speaking to each other.\n\nThe duo's reunion was prompted by the fact that Gary Jules and Michael Andrews' version of their number-one hit Mad World took the song to the top of the charts once more.\n\nAnd they are currently holed up together in a recording studio for the first time in 15 years.\n\nHaving finally buried the hatchet, Orzabal and Smith have just announced that they're set to tour the UK in April next year.\n\nTheir live performances will follow hot on the heels of the imminent release of new material that they've recorded for a new album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, due to be released in February on Gut Records. They will be at Newcastle City Hall on April 29.\n\n\"Both Curt and I are really looking forward to the forthcoming UK dates,\" says Orzabal.\n\n\"There is an amazing feeling you get from a live performance and in particular with British audiences, which we obviously haven't experienced in quite some time. Not only do we get the chance to play some of our classic songs, but we also get to perform material from our new album, which has proved a real labour of love.\"\n\nA friendship that started when Curt and Roland were 13-year-olds in Bath, Somerset, developed into a phenomenon. They pioneered the use of keyboard synthesisers in 80s pop music.\n\nDuring this period Tears for Fears crafted some of the most eloquent pop songs of the day.\n\nOrzabal and Smith first hit pay dirt with their 1983 debut album The Hurting, a collection of introverted, electro-tinged pop songs which spawned the huge hits Mad World, Pale Shelter and Change.\n\nThe band's 1985 album Songs from the Big Chair was a global success, spawning three top-five singles in the US alone and selling some 30 million copies worldwide, while 1989's Sowing the Seeds of Love enjoyed similarly spectacular sales figures.\n\nSome memorable melodies make up Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, and those who felt that the Beatles' fingerprints were all over Tears for Fears' earlier work will doubtless draw similar conclusions about this latest release.\n\n\"For me, this is the album that should've followed Seeds of Love in many ways,\" says Orzabal.\n\n\"When we did Sowing the Seeds of Love we were doing Lennon . . . but I would say the main influence for Everybody Loves a Happy Ending was McCartney, simply because I think McCartney is the new Lennon!\"\n\nV Tears for Fears will be at Newcastle City Hall on April 29.
