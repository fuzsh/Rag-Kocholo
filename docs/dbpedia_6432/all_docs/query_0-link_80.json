        "text": "#10: Sandra Volkom\n\n“Ghosts of Girlfriends Past” (2009)\n\nWeddings can be stressful affairs. But Sandra is a little too quick to go on the warpath. Inspired by Charles Dickens' holiday classic \"A Christmas Carol,\" \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past” follows playboy photographer Connor as he attends his brother’s wedding. His brother’s bride-to-be, Sandra, has her heart set on having her wedding be as perfect as possible. To be fair, Connor’s behavior would stress anyone out - especially when he destroys the wedding cake! She’s a bit of a bridezilla from the get-go, but Connor brings out the worst in her with his pre-wedding drama!\n\n#9: Rachel\n\n“Sonic the Hedgehog 2” (2022)\n\nWhile the Sonic movies are about, well, Sonic and his adventures, sometimes we see how much chaos he leaves behind. Sonic was adopted by Tom and Maddie Wachowski, who get some much-needed rest and relaxation in Hawaii for Maddie’s sister’s wedding. Unfortunately her sister Rachel has never been much of a fan of Tom, and offers to bury the hatchet under the strict conditions that he can’t ruin her wedding. While he technically doesn’t, the portal from Siberia with Sonic and an avalanche certainly might. Did we mention her fiancé Randall is actually an undercover agent who catfished her to catch Sonic? Yeah. You get your revenge, Rachel, we just hope you’re happy.\n\n#8: Meredith Goldstein\n\n“Dirty Grandpa” (2016)\n\nDoomed from the start, Jason and Meredith's engagement was full of major red flags. The bride-to-be is controlling and manipulative, while the groom is passive and submissive. Meredith becomes so consumed by the wedding planning that she even interrupts her fiance's grandmother's funeral to pick out a tie! Her attention-seeking ways eventually backfire on her during a climactic ending when all her lies and secrets are publicly exposed. It’s super cringy to watch, but also oh-so-satisfying to see this mega diva knocked off her pedestal.\n\n#7: Annie Banks\n\n“Father of the Bride” (1991)\n\nWeddings are a billion-dollar industry. A modestly-sized one can easily eat up your savings and push families to their financial breaking points. In \"Father of the Bride,\" George Banks is forced to foot the bill for his daughter Annie's special day. She doesn't consider the monetary stress and assumes that he has it covered. Unwilling to compromise on the guest list, or the fee for a top-tier planner, she racks up the bills, pushing her dad off the deep end. To be fair, George certainly has his flaws and off-kilter ideas, too Annie is too caught up in the details to intervene.\n\n#6: Maggie Carpenter\n\n“Runaway Bride” (1999)\n\nIn the most severe case of \"cold feet\" ever, \"Runaway Bride's\" Maggie Carpenter isn't your typical Bridezilla. While she isn’t a diva, she does leave behind a trail of broken hearts wherever she goes. The serial bride's aversion to saying \"I Do\" has her running, sprinting and even galloping away from the altar. We are all for following your instincts, but her over-the-top exits become a little tried by the third ceremony. Perhaps, Miss Carpenter is better suited for an Olympic race track than a little white chapel.\n\n#5: Laura Garrety\n\n“Very Bad Things” (1998)\n\nNothing will stop some brides from getting their picture-perfect day. However, in the black comedy \"Very Bad Things”, Cameron Diaz’s character Laura Garrety takes it to another level. After her fiance’s bachelor party takes a deadly turn, the groomsmen scramble to cover it up. When she finds out, Laura’s only concern is for her dream wedding. She bludgeons one of the groomsmen and forces her fiance into ever darker places to serve herself. By the end, she gets a taste of her own medicine and has to live miserably ever after.\n\n#4: Tess Nichols\n\n“27 Dresses” (2008)\n\n\"Always a bridesmaid, never a bride\" is the premise for the 2008 rom-com, \"27 Dresses\". In the film, veteran maid of honor Jane has her patience put to the ultimate test when her younger sister, Tess, becomes engaged to her own boss and crush, George. If that's not bad enough, Tess is a certified diva when it comes to planning. It all comes to a head when Jane discovers that Tess has taken their mother's wedding dress and redesigned it. Jane eventually gets her revenge by exposing her little sister's secrets and taking this bridezilla down a notch.\n\n#3: Muriel Heslop\n\n“Muriel’s Wedding” (1994)\n\nIn the beloved Australian comedy \"Muriel's Wedding,\" the titular protagonist dreams of a more glamorous life and a big, fancy wedding. Her obsession however sets her on a path that takes her from sweet and kind to an over-the-top diva. Everything she does is self-serving, from lying to her parents to agreeing to marry a stranger. Although she has an undeniable charm, it's hard to see past her deceit and bad behavior. By the end of the film, the ABBA-loving Aussie sees the errors in her ways, but it's a long walk down the aisle before she comes to her senses.\n\n#2: Emma Allen\n\n“Bride Wars” (2009)\n\nIn \"Bride Wars,\" lifelong friends Emma and Liv find their respective weddings scheduled for the same day, which ignites a full-fledged battle between them. Anne Hathaway’s character Emma goes from being a sweet and passive elementary school teacher to a ruthless egomaniac hellbent on sabotaging her BFFs big day. She’ll stop at nothing, stealing the spotlight during Liv’s bachelorette, and dying her frenemies’ hair bright blue! Ultimately, the brides-to-be do reconcile. But for a while there, Emma’s upcoming wedding changed her very much for the worse.\n\n#1: Olivia “Liv” Lerner\n\n“Bride Wars” (2009)\n\nThe brides in this film take both our top spots. The only person who goes more bridezilla than Emma is her best friend Liv, played by Kate Hudson. With both Liv and Emma’s weddings scheduled for the same day, and neither willing to back down, Liv goes on the attack. It’s bad enough that she gives her friend-turned-foe an orange spray tan. But she also sets a plan in motion to shame Emma right as she walks down the aisle! To her credit, Liv did try to take back this action at the last minute, but to no avail. It’s a humiliating betrayal, even if it does all work out for the best in the end!"
