        "text": "William Shatner stopped by to promote his ‘Raw Nerve’ interview show on Biography – and Howard immediately pressured him to reconcile with George Takei on-air.\n\nBill didn’t think the show was the right venue: “We don’t wanna do that here…we have to make an occasion of it!”\n\nHoward wondered what came between them, so Bill explained that there wasn’t much of an issue outside of the media’s interest: “Here’s the problem…it’s very popular fodder.”\n\nHoward then got George Takei on the line, who gave his own take on the rift: “Bill, we invited you to our wedding and then you went on YouTube ranting and raving that you hadn’t got an invitation…you’re a wonderful actor, but I can’t understand why you go off on these wild tangents.”\n\nHoward wondered if Bill was willing to put the problem behind him, but Bill just joked: “Putting it behind me may be a risky endeavor.”\n\nKirk & Sulu to Bury the Hatchet\n\nGeorge noted that he and several former ‘Star Trek’ cast members had problems with Bill’s behavior: “On set as well as off.”\n\nBill cut in to question why they’d remained bitter for so long: “40 years ago…for the last many years, George has expressed dissatisfaction with me. I have remained, in a dignified fashion, silent.”\n\nBill eventually consented to sit down for a Howard-mediated conversation – as long as it was made into an episode of his ‘Raw Nerve’ TV show.\n\nHoward agreed so long as he was never the subject – just the rift between Bill and George.\n\nOn the J.J. Abrams ‘Trek’ Film\n\nHoward asked Bill how he felt about the latest ‘Star Trek’ film, and Bill confessed: “I have not seen it…of course I would have loved to have been a part of this history.”\n\nBill said the director, JJ Abrams, had recently reached out to him: “JJ said to me he would have a screening at Paramount…JJ get ready. I’m gonna take you up on the offer.”"
