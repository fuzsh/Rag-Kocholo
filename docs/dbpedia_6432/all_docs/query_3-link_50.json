        "text": "Pro-Social Content\n\nA couple facing a split are urged to recall their “eternal vows”(“Promises”). “Just My Imagination” credits a divine personality with creating the gift of love. On “You and Me, “lead singer Dolores O’Riordan pays tribute to her young son. She credits a person with being her “Saving Grace” and rejects a man who has habitually lied to her (“Shattered”). The singer is determined not to follow the crowd on “Copycat”(“So much for the radio/Everybody sounds the same/Everybody wears the same clothes now and everybody plays the game”). The love song “What’s on My Mind” expresses undying devotion.\n\nWith frustration and concern, “Fee Fi Fo” boldly condemns the sexual abuse of children (“How could you get satisfaction from the body of a child?/You’re vile, sick”).\n\nObjectionable Content\n\nBitter over being spurned by a lover, a vengeful woman longs to see him miserable (“Loud and Clear”).

On “Delilah, “O’Riordan threatens to “rearrange” someone’s face."
