        "text": "Hugh Grant recently told People that Robert Downey Jr. \"hated\" and \"wanted to kill\" him. Way harsh, Tai. But apparently the \"Avengers\" star no longer feels that way.\n\nGrant is now promoting \"Paddington 2,\" and he recently did some word association with People's editor-in-chief Jess Cagle. Grant was asked about several past costars, including RDJ, with whom he worked in the 1995 movie \"Restoration.\" Guess they didn't get along.\n\nHere's how Grant responded to the name \"Robert Downey Jr.\":\n\nHugh Grant: \"Hated me. Hated me. We did a thing called 'Restoration' and he took one look at me and wanted to kill me.\"\n\nJess Cagle: \"Why would he hate you on sight?\"\n\nGrant: \"I don't know. I was so hurt.\"\n\nCagle: \"I don't think anybody really hates you.\"\n\nGrant: \"He did.\"\n\nAny other day, we'd take that will several grains of salt. This is the same Hugh Grant who, in the same interview, joked that his two-time costar Emma Thompson is \"not remotely sane\" and just gets \"nuttier and nuttier as the years go by.\" He also said his \"Music and Lyrics\" costar Drew Barrymore \"did hate me a bit\" and there was tension on that set. He may very well just be a giant pain in the tush to everyone on sets. But he also likes to quip and exaggerate.\n\nSo on their own, his remarks about Downey didn't mean much -- until Downey validated them by tweeting that he was ready to make peace with Grant:\n\nRobert Downey Jr. is not someone who tweets very often, and it's rare to see him respond to reports. But he was quick to respond to this, so he must've seen some truth there and felt they had both matured enough to move forward.\n\nGood for him. And good for Hugh Grant. Also, good for \"Paddington 2,\" which is currently holding strong with a 100 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes."
