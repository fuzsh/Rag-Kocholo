        "text": "Taylor Swift’s had one hell of a summer. Some might even call it . . . complicated. Though she’s done her damnedest to become the Millennial face of #girlpower, welcoming everyone from Cara Delevingne to Julia Roberts and Joan Baez to Uzo Aduba to her 1989 world-tour stage, behind the scenes, she’s engaged in a bit of social-media drama with some of her pop-star peers.\n\nFirst, there was that whole Nicki Minaj VMA kerfuffle, which saw Swift jumping to her own defense too quickly, then apologizing for something of an intersectional-feminism fail. Then, Katy Perry—rumored subject of Swift’s barn-burning “Bad Blood”—stepped into the ring, posting an inscrutable tweet about Swift that may or may not have been translated from Sanskrit. And last week, Swift accidentally pissed off Avril Lavigne’s fandom by favoriting a Tumblr post that unfavorably compared Swift’s effusive backstage meet-and-greets to Lavigne’s own hug-averse approach to her fans.\n\nLavigne, who like all Canadians had been busy axing down trees in a wintry northern forest, thinking about how her father had always told her never to act too enthusiastic in front of Americans, soon caught on to Swift’s likely completely meaningless mouse click. “Comparison is judging and judging a person does not define who they are it defines who you are. We all Love our fans,” tweeted Lavigne, guzzling several gallons of warm maple syrup to return feeling to her extremities. Realizing how passive-aggressive she sounded, she responsibly washed and recycled the syrup container and posted another tweet: “So let’s keep it all about the love and stay positive.”\n\nSwift acted fast: By Saturday night, she’d already welcomed Lavigne to her 1989 stage in San Diego, where the two joined forces to sing “Complicated,” Lavigne’s 2002 hit about how, one day, she would join Taylor Swift onstage even though Taylor Swift had just accidentally insulted her on Twitter. The two then ran home—Swift to her tour bus, Lavigne to her starkly beautiful forest—and posted a flurry of photos and praise to the same social-media channels that started it all.\n\nLet’s recap, so we’ll remember this story when we have to tell it to our grandchildren:\n\nRising Action:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nCelebrity\n\nKarlie Kloss Is Still a Swiftie, Thanks\n\nThe philanthropist and model loves the entirety of The Tortured Poets Department, and told an interviewer that Taylor Swift's “music is classic.”\n\nCelebrity\n\nWill Taylor Swift Endorse Kamala Harris?\n\nAfter President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection, the world waits to see if Miss Americana will deploy the Swifties to vote for Vice President Harris in November.\n\nCelebrity\n\nRole Model Is Ready to Move On\n\nThe 27-year-old singer-songwriter opens up about his love-hate relationship with LA, how his split from Emma Chamberlain inspired his sophomore album, Kansas Anymore, and his upcoming tour with Gracie Abrams.\n\nCelebrity\n\nKamala Harris Clinches the Crucial Brat Vote, Thanks to Charli XCX\n\nKamala Harris, the Democratic Party front-runner after President Joe Biden halted his campaign, is the candidate the social media age didn’t know it was waiting for.\n\nCelebrity\n\nFor Kamala Harris, First Came Charli XCX.
