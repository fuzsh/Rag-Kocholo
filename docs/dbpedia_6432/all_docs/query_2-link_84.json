It’s more universally accessible, relying less on language and more on visual and physical gags to elicit laughter.\n\nExample: The Three Stooges films are classic examples of Low Comedy, with their iconic physical slapstick, visual gags, and simple, direct humor appealing to a broad audience without the need for sophisticated dialogue.\n\nSummary\n\nWriting Tips\n\nFor writers looking to explore High Comedy or Low Comedy, here are some strategies:\n\nHigh Comedy: Develop your wit and understanding of societal norms to craft sophisticated humor.
