        "text": "Incredible, you say? What do you see? No, perhaps we should ask, what do you *not* see? Here's a couple of things you might see without realising it... â‘  The normativity of how an ideal relationship with our younger selves should look. How many of us might be triggered by such a \"Hollywood\" display of idealised affection? â‘¡ The fake news of how these celebrities might actually feel about their younger selves? â‘¢ The ableism of \"perfect beauty\" that this video perpetuates? â‘£ The superficiality of AI's view of love? In the world's most popular and influential belief system, the very paradigm of love is sacrifice. Yet here, it's Disney. â‘¤ The algorithms responsible for all of this, hidden and embedded underneath the surface, influencing our notions of right and wrong, good and bad, beautiful and ugly. Yeah, I know. I'm just an old cynic. But Diogenes at least had all the best one-liners. ðŸ˜„ https://lnkd.in/egSbA25W\n\nSince we launched TiNA the #SliemaGirl #ai #personalassistant on Saturday over 400 people have engaged with her online, asking all sorts of weird and wonderful questions. Initially the purpose of creating TiNA was as simply a #marketing gimmick - something To create some spin for the Comedy Knights latest show - you know create a chatbot with sliema attitude - simply for #hype But as we started to work on her, I began to see more and more opportunities where she could actually be very useful Suddenly she became an additional way to help our sponsors, engage with our digital audience. If you chat to her about going to a #spa, she recommends Myoka Spas , talk to her about her fav radio station #BayEasy pops up and with ways for audiences to engage. She became an entertaining customer care tool, answering the questions about the show that we get ask repeatedly. But whatâ€™s more she became her own source of entertainment to many of our digital audience - 17% of whom have spent over 30 mins conversing with her asking everything from her thoughts on Pythagorasâ€™s Theorem to how to cope with a breakup - and she fired off amazing answers with a lot of sliema sass. This is only scratching the surface- as we develop this further, weâ€™re going to see a number of different ways we can engage, entertain and s convert digital audiences using these exciting new tools available to us today! A big thanks to my colleague Sean Ellul - for helping me with this crazy idea which - I think - is the start of something Big! If you havenâ€™t already tried her, Iâ€™d suggest you do visit The Comedy Knights, Facebook or read the article below to find out more. #ai #artificialintelligence #llm #chatbot #entertainment #showbots #consumerengagement #digitalaudiences #interactiveentertainment https://lnkd.in/d2ChEGAP"
