        "text": "Did Blade bury his bad blood? New BTS photos from the set of Deadpool and Wolverine seem to squash the longtime feud between Ryan Reynolds and Wesley Snipes.\n\nOne of the most shocking cameos in Deadpool and Wolverine was the return of Wesley Snipes as Blade. This was largely due to the infamous feud between Wesley Snipes and Ryan Reynolds, which stemmed back to their time working on Blade: Trinity. However, a new batch of BTS photos seem to bury the hatchet between the two rivals as Reynolds calls Snipes the “Marvel Daddy”:\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of these BTS photos is Ryan Reynolds advocating that Wesley Snipes gets one final ride as Blade, akin to Hugh Jackman’s Logan. Given eagle-eyed viewers have realized Blade (and the rest of the reject team) survived the events of Deadpool and Wolverine, it’s certainly not out of the question he could return once more.\n\nBlade’s Future In The Marvel Multiverse\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine isn’t the only project Marvel was working on with Blade. While Wesley Snipes and Ryan Reynolds were yucking it up on set, the upcoming Blade reboot has been through some rough developments. Having lost the project’s writer, director, and millions in scrapped pre-production, the studio is hoping to get the film on track sooner rather than later.\n\nAs for Wesley Snipes, while it’s certainly possible he could get a solo flick following the success of Deadpool and Wolverine, it’s more likely that he’ll reunite with Ryan Reynolds on the set of a future Avengers movie as the multiverse collides once more. Let’s just hope the smiles from the BTS photos continue into that project!\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is now playing in theaters.
