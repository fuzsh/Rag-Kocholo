        "text": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988)\n\nThe Moment: The opening animated short over, Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman walk off-set and into a live-action film studio.\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...could the major studios be persuaded to bury the hatchet and collaborate on something like this.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: Failing to get the character rights, they’d have to use made-up ‘toons instead of classic Disney and Loony Tunes icons.\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nThe Moment: Mandy Patinkin repeats his mantra, just in case Christopher Guest doesn’t get it: “I am Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!”\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...did every film have a catchphrase.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: Inigo Montoya? Too foreign. How about Chuck Manly?\n\nTop Gun (1986)\n\nThe Moment: Seduction, Navy Seal style – Tom Cruise sings a karaoke You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling to pull Kelly McGillis.\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...would the entire bar join in.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: It’d probably be a sodding James Blunt song.\n\nIndiana Jones and The Temple of Doom (1984)\n\nThe Moment: A waiter with a gun. A diamond on ice. A poisoned Indy. And a great big massive gong. Anything goes in Shanghai.\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...was Spielberg rocking the confidence to open an action-adventure with a screwball/musical hybrid.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: A gopher in the desert. Not quite as iconic, is it?\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)\n\nThe Moment: Judd Reinhold gets caught having a wank as he imagines Phoebe Cates taking off her red bikini.\n\nOnly In The '80s: Could something this pervy be so strangely innocent.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: The scene would be kept back until the uncut extended DVD release.\n\nStand By Me (1986)\n\nThe Moment: Gordie LaChance tells his latest short story to his friends – the tale of pie-eating machine Lardass.\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...could a complete and total barf-o-rama come across as charming.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: All crudity, zero charm.\n\nThe Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nThe Moment: Troubled Judd Nelson gets out of detention a changed man, and punches the air in triumph.\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...could a single man – John Hughes – unite the athletes, basket cases, princesses, geeks and criminals.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: The influence of Glee would ensure that ‘Alive and Kicking’ would be sung by the cast.\n\nThe Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)\n\nThe Moment: Michelle Pfeiffer drapes herself over a piano in the slinkiest of red dresses and melts hearts and more with her rendition of Making Whoopee .\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...could a romantic drama be made starring Beau Bridges. Jeff, yes. But not Beau.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: The Baker Boys would probably be bakers.\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nThe Moment: Real-life Marine Drill Sergeant R. Lee Ermey practices his stand-up comedy routine on his latest recruits. “I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around.\"\n\nOnly In The '80s: ...would Vietnam War movies be so popular a director could made half a film simply about their training.\n\nIf It Was Made Today: They’d probably hire an actor to play the sarge.\n\nThe Long Good Friday (1980)"
