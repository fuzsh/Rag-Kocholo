        "text": "We’re fans of Ti West. From his breakout classic The House of the Devil to last year’s brutally sex-positive slasher X, West is one of modern horror’s undeniable storytellers. Today we get a peek at the trailer for Pearl, his X prequel promised as early as last March. Now you can see where the nightmare began. Watch the official trailer for Pearl below.\n\nWith Pearl, “filmmaker Ti West returns with another chapter from the twisted world of X, in this astonishing follow-up to the year’s most acclaimed horror film. Trapped on her family’s isolated farm, Pearl must tend to her ailing father under the bitter and overbearing watch of her devout mother. Lusting for a glamorous life like she’s seen in the movies, Pearl’s ambitions, temptations, and repressions all collide, in the stunning, technicolor-inspired origin story of X’s iconic villain.“\n\nPearl comes written by Ti West & Mia Goth and is helmed X creator by Ti West. It stars Mia Goth, David Corenswet, Tandi Wright, Matthew Sunderland, and Emma Jenkins-Purro.\n\nA24’s horror prequel arrives in theater’s September 16th.\n\nWatch the trailer for Pearl right here\n\nCheck out Dread Central’s four-star X review which highlighted some of the film’s brutality: “X isn’t cerebral, but there is a shocking amount of brain matter splattered on the screen,” writes Drew Tinnin.
