        "text": "Celeste Delacroix Griffin is having a lousy day. True, she’s been sprung from the slammer just in time for Christmas Eve, after that little shoplifting incident. But it’s been a quick roll downhill from there for this seedy vagabond from “The Mutilated,” a rarely seen Tennessee Williams comedy being boisterously revived at the New Ohio Theater in a production starring the quirky team of Penny Arcade and Mink Stole.\n\nAfter bailing out Celeste, her brother abandons her quickly and without a dime with this merry parting salvo: “I never want to see you again in my life, so bum your Christmas dinner off somebody else!” Celeste (Penny Arcade) doesn’t get a warmer welcome when she returns home to the Silver Dollar Hotel, whose caretaker informs her that her belongings have been confiscated for nonpayment of back rent.\n\nAny chance that she can return to cadging from her erstwhile best friend, Trinket Dugan (Mink Stole), is quickly scuttled: “We can’t bury the hatchet,” Trinket shouts through the door to her room. “We hit each other too hard.”\n\nThese humiliations might batter a weaker spirit, but Celeste flicks them away like flies. “Give up is something I never even think of,” she muses, when told to do just that. “I’ll go on.” As portrayed with blazing vitality and a kind of childish glee by Penny Arcade, Celeste’s avowals are impossible to doubt. Armed with a canny resourcefulness — not to mention an ample bosom she aims at the world like guns defending a fortified bunker — Celeste will make her way forward as she always has, with a hearty laugh and no backward glances. If you’re stuck at the bottom of the barrel, her thinking might go, you may as well have a high old time rolling around in it.\n\nThere is something pleasingly fitting in having Williams’s exotically named, fringe-dwelling characters played by two performers who themselves have floridly funny names and who have made their careers largely on the outer margins of show business: Penny Arcade in the New York performance art scene, Mink Stole as a contract player in the informal movie studio run by the renegade John Waters.\n\nMy fears that this would prove to be an unprofitable bit of stunt casting quickly evaporated once the director Cosmin Chivu’s production roared into life, with the happily tooting horns of a live Dixieland jazz band. Neither actress has much experience in traditional theater, but these two inhabit the scarred souls of their contrasting characters with an intuitive confidence, bringing these comic grotesques to scabrously funny life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
