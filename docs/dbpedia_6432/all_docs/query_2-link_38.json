        "text": "Premiere of Is It So Crazy To Dream It? in Oct, 2022\n\nJasmine created a new work for this event hosted by En Garde Arts and curated by Gabriel Torres. Is It So Crazy to Dream It? focuses on memory her being proposed to by a man she just met at a wedding in India, and saying “Yes.” It was a joke though, right?\n\nThe piece explores the boundaries we place on ourselves and our dreams, while defiantly letting the world at large tell us “no” while we defiantly continue to say “Yes.” Jasmine intends to develop the piece from is current 19 minute run time into a short one woman show.\n\n28 is Great Screened in Oct, 2022 at Artists and Beers\n\n28 is Great receives 4th screening at Artists and Beers, produced monthly by Chip Parham and Nancy Pop at Easy Lover in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nCheck out an excerpt below from the Q&A afterwards!\n\n28 is Great Screened on June 5th, 2022 on Long Beach Island, NJ\n\n28 is Great receives 3rd official selection at 14th Annual Lighthouse International Film Festival. Their program includes Sundance and SXSW titles as Headliners and acclaimed international films in the Spotlight section. Also, Lighthouse put its dark side on display in a new installment dedicated to genre, horror, sci-fi, and fantastic movies entitled DARKHOUSE. The festival will took place for the 14th consecutive year on Long Beach Island (LBI), NJ, from Thursday, June 2nd through Sunday, June 5th.\n\nCheck Out Lighthouse’s Website Here!\n\nThe Oracle, written by Joe Queenan and T.J. Elliott, opens for an equity showcase run in The Cino Theater at Theater for the New City in NYC. Micky Cohen, The Oracle Leo Sweeney’s number two and head of Information Services, gets caught in the rages of high-caliber office politics in this new two act play.\n\nTheater Scene\n\nOpening Night Review!\n\nThe familiar cutthroat terrain of Executive Suite, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Network and 30 Rock is enjoyably trod here again, with a dartboard cleverly proving to be instrumental…. Their adept writing marks The Oracle as a sound comedy.… The gray-haired, suited up, animated Ed Altman energizes the show with his winning wacky portrayal of the CEO, channeling J.B. Biggley, Ted Baxter and Howard Beale. Jasmine Dorothy Haefner and Hassan Hope as well as the aforementioned Alyssa Poon and Patrick Smith all offer vivid characterizations as the other archetypical office figures…\n\nBroadway World\n\nAlthough The Oracle tells a fictional story of a CEO pitting employees against each other in a kind of survival of the most fit for corporate America, it's a funny journey into the office, very different from the TV show of that name. This production at TNC is a powerful, new play ... writ large, not about the American dream, as Death of a Salesman is, but the largely unmined humor of American corporate reality. How to succeed in business without really knowing,\" Elliott jokes about an apt subtitle. \"The ability to sell themselves and sell their ideas makes them successful.\n\nThe Village Sun\n\n“The story is about how, in business, one succeeds not by doing what the textbook will tell you,'‘ Elliott explained. In a world where business is rarely viewed as fodder for laughter, Queenan in the pages (and digital views) of The Wall Street Journal and now with Elliott on stage finds humor and heart. Rather than wielding weapons, the characters wield wit as they struggle for power and position.”\n\nA conflict ridden crew attempts to film a mystery project knowing the only people they have to rely on is themselves.\n\nMidwest Regional Premiere at Twin Cities Film Fest\n\n28 is Great had its midwestern premiere at the Twin Cities Film Fest in October, 2021 at the ShowPlace ICON Theatre in St. Louis Park, MN.\n\nRed Carpet Interview with Charla Marie Bailey\n\nThe Angel of Death pays a visit to audiences in Dust Vanishes Away at The Loisaida Center. Will they be taken? Has she been with them all the time? Will she always be? Should you be afraid?\n\nWatch our interview with The Loisaida Inc. Center here.\n\nShow to ran from May 2021 to August 2021 at Teatro Circulo in NYC.\n\nIn Grudges, two brothers, who's already contentious relationship was further sundered by the 2016 election, get together for a ‘bury-the-hatchet’ family dinner. Everything goes awry when Paul brings along his new girlfriend, who's nearly half his age. That's me, Candy Cruz, a 30-year-old sharply intelligent Cuban American who met Paul while they both worked on Trump's campaign. She's a top-notch social media consultant who certainly leans right, but works for the party that bids the highest.\n\nPerformances ran over 7-shows from July 16th-24th!\n\nIf you’re in an industry professional and would like to see the work, please send me a message through my contact page and I’ll be happy to send along a link."
