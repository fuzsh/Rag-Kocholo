        "text": "They played enemies in Pretty in Pink and the tension translated behind-the-scenes too. While filming the classic ’80s Brat Pack film, Jon Cryer and Andrew McCarthy famously did not get along. The young stars avoided each other but decades later they were able to finally reconcile and patch things up after a chance encounter. In 2012, both men were promoting various projects in separate segments of the talk show The View.\n\nDuring Cryer’s appearance, he shared, “He and I famously did not get along when we were shooting ‘Pretty in Pink.’ It was because there was tension. Interestingly, I saw him backstage and we had a lovely time, we had a great talk. Thank you!”\n\nHe added, “At any rate, what I realize now, he wrote a terrific memoir called Brat, he was already struggling with alcoholism back when we were shooting that movie. I’d projected all this stuff on him at the time, I thought he’s this sullen guy that doesn’t want to talk to me. We’re enemies [as characters] on the movie, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be friends.” These days, McCarthy has translated his memoir into a new documentary, featuring many of his famous friends from the 1980s.\n\nThe documentary will explore films such as Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo’s Fire, and The Breakfast Club, which connected with audiences in a way that people had never seen. They enlisted a cult-like following that never died down and the stars of these films’ lives were truly changed because they were a part of it. It will feature stars such as Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, and others.\n\nMcCarthy shared in a recent interview, “I just sort of reached out to people and said, ‘You know, this has had such a profound effect on my life and on my career.’ And it seems so silly. It’s some silly little term, ‘The Brat Pack.’ That was one magazine article [that coined the name], a regional magazine that came out on a Tuesday; and by Friday, the nation was using the term ‘Brat Pack,’ and our lives were different.” Tell us, who’s your favorite Brat Pack star?"
