        "text": "Set in the high-profile worlds of national politics and the entertainment industry, this 10-episode series avoids any scathing satirical dissection of either professional sphere, keeping the tone light and frothy as it skips through a procession of matrimonial misadventures.\n\nTaishi Shoji (Matsuzaka) is a fledgling politician, following in the intimidating footsteps of his recently deceased father. When he is snapped by the paparazzi in a romantic clinch with beautiful young reporter Sakurako (Lisa Oda), his wife Yui (Naka) asks for a divorce, an act certain to derail her husband’s political future.\n\nYui is a far more prominent and popular public figure than her husband. A beloved television actress, she is the star of numerous popular drama series and a string of big ticket ad campaigns.\n\nBut her enduring appeal is her relatable housewife persona, so her management strongly opposes a separation, which would also trigger a hefty penalty fee from her endorsement deals.\n\nYui and Taishi hail from widely different backgrounds. A third generation politician, Taishi comes from wealth and privilege. His overbearing mother (Keiko Takeshita) lives in the apartment above theirs and runs his election campaign. She absolutely forbids Yui from leaving her son, and pressures them to keep trying for a child instead.\n\nThe situation is further complicated when it is revealed Yui has also become romantically entangled with a penniless artist (Ryo Nishikido).\n\nThe couple decide to lawyer up, with Taishi hiring the glamorous Kaoru (Yuka Itaya) while Yui retains the services of wily legal veteran Henry (Arata Furuta), only to discover that their legal councils also share a romantic past.\n\nEverything comes to a head when a snap election is called and Taishi must run for office in his home prefecture of Ehime – coincidentally where Yui films her popular romance series.\n\nRunning opposite Taishi is Go Soda (Koji Yamamoto), an ambitious and eager emerging politician who is sure to give the mistake- and scandal-prone Taishi a run for his money. To make the campaign even spicier, Soda hires Sakurako – who still holds a candle for Taishi – as his running mate.\n\nSuffice to say there is a lot going on in Let’s Get Divorced, but the show seems to thrive on its chaotic energy, even as it becomes cluttered with red herrings and narrative digressions that distract from the central story.\n\nNarushi Ikeda’s vile entertainment impresario is a particular highlight, repeatedly exploiting Yui’s star talent for his own gain, and the show would have been infinitely more fascinating had it probed deeper into his dealings, rather than reduce him to a mere cartoonish annoyance Yui must avoid.\n\nIn the end of course, despite everything that is going on in their busy and conflicting lives, Yui and Taishi still love each other, and there is never any doubt how everything will eventually unfold.\n\nRiisa Naka is effortlessly likeable, and even Tori Matsuzaka’s idiot man-child grinds you into submission eventually; you find yourself genuinely rooting for the feuding couple to bury the hatchet.\n\nHad this been a zippy two-hour movie, Let’s Get Divorced could have been a legitimate hit, but stretched out over nearly 12 hours, it more often makes for laborious viewing.\n\nLet’s Get Divorced is streaming on Netflix."
