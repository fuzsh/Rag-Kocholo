She says, 'The University gave me the chance to develop my public speaking skills, both on my course but mainly whilst being a Student Ambassador. I led a lot of the accommodation tours on College Lane and De Havilland campuses, which was a huge confidence booster.'\n\nTomi had a great time at the University and says, 'My degree was all coursework based which worked well for me as exams had always made me feel uneasy. My course mates were very supportive. I thoroughly enjoyed working and collaborating together on projects. The loan store was also super useful as they provided free photographic equipment for us to use for the duration of the course.'\n\nShe encourages future and current students to make the most of what the University has to offer. She says, 'Don't be scared if you're going on your own. Make use of your time inside and outside of your course. Join clubs and make new friends. As a photography student, be open to criticism and other people's creative ideas. Not everyone sees your vision and that's okay as there's always room for improvement!'\n\nFuture aspirations\n\nTomi is determined to continue to develop in her role and possibly take her next steps to work on London-based productions. She says, 'I love my job and I hope to expand further within the film and TV industry. One day I’d love to work on-set and experience how a production is made.’"
