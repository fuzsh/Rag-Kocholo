        "text": "West Hollywood, Calif.\n\nON the face of it, Debra Granik’s gracefully melancholy second feature has much in common with her first, right down to its chilly title. Like her 2004 debut feature, “Down to the Bone,” a vérité indie about an upstate New York mother trying to ditch her drug habit for the sake of her children, “Winter’s Bone” is a closely observed drama whose protagonist is a young woman scraping by in a decaying corner of America rarely visited by filmmakers who have not passed through the Sundance Screenwriters Lab. That “Winter’s Bone” is also a bit of a thriller with a generous dusting of the Brothers Grimm is a departure for Ms. Granik, but we’ll get to that.\n\nJust as “Down to the Bone” helped make a star out of Vera Farmiga, now a household name for her wry turn as George Clooney’s frequent-flying squeeze in “Up in the Air,” “Winter’s Bone” will surely give a well-earned push to the career of Jennifer Lawrence. The seraphic-looking 19-year-old, who picked up admiring notices for her role in the 2008 drama “The Burning Plain,” gives a raw, quietly truculent performance as Ree Dolly, an Ozarks teenager. She has a week to track down her father, a crystal-meth dealer who has vanished after putting the family’s house up for bail bond  or face eviction.\n\nRee already cares for her dissipated mother and two younger siblings, but her tenacious refusal to be intimidated out of her search by either the cops or a clan of hatchet-faced blood relatives carrying secrets is the kind of willpower Ms. Granik has always been drawn to.\n\n“The question I’ve had for most of my life is, ‘How are you coping?’ ” said Ms. Granik, a warm, intense and articulate brunette who, at 47, looks like a patrician elf. “Some people have these small, positive schemes for survival, a kind of strength that I am attracted to, maybe because I’m prone to the blues.”\n\nUnlike the addicted mother in “Down to the Bone,” who was based on a person Ms. Granik stumbled upon while at film school, Ree is a character out of a visceral 2006 novel by the Missouri writer Daniel Woodrell. The book brought Ms. Granik and her creative partner, Anne Rosellini, welcome relief from an avalanche of screenplays featuring damaged or depressed young women. “We had just come off a long year of reading scripts in which each female protagonist was more ill and rickety and pathetic and pathologically devastated than the last,” Ms. Granik said. “It went from cutting to sexual abuse to all forms of injuries. There was even a remake of ‘The Snake Pit.’ ”\n\nMs. Granik added: “That’s not to say we were looking for a perfect female protagonist. But Ree shone out as someone whose competence and tenacity and unpredictable responses we enjoyed.”\n\nWomen drive the action in “Winter’s Bone,” sometimes violently so, yet not one of them is a chick-flick role model, least of all Ree. And the nearest thing to a happy ending is the kind of provisional survival that typically caps the politically engaged filmmaking to which Ms. Granik came to by what she called “an organic, incremental process.”\n\nMs. Granik’s own roots are far from proletarian. Her grandfather was the broadcasting pioneer Theodore Granik, and she grew up in an affluent suburb of Washington. But her father was a fair-housing government litigator and her mother a late arrival to feminism. Ms. Granik’s left-liberal politics were further shaped in and around Boston, where she studied documentary film history at Brandeis University and became active in the feminist and democratic media movements of the early ’80s.\n\nMaking educational films for trade unions after she graduated, she was constantly sidetracked by seemingly superfluous details of her subjects’ lives. “I start from observation, that’s how my brain proceeds,” she said. “I would watch this Dorchester exterminator remove his facial hair, and when I found out that he was also a deacon, I got so caught up in his life.”\n\nIn the graduate film program at New York University, Ms. Granik discovered Italian and East-European neo-realism and post-World War II British kitchen-sink dramas. Under the tutelage of her Latvian-born mentor, Boris Frumin, to whom she still shows her rough cuts, she made the short film “Snake Feed,” which got her into the Sundance labs for both screenwriting and directing, where she nursed it into “Down to the Bone.”\n\nMs. Granik hung out for long periods with the real-life model for that film, reaping details from how she organized her life. For “Winter’s Bone,” she used film, videotape and stills to document the daily routines of several Ozark families, then built them into the movie’s junky, atmospheric beauty with the high-resolution Red digital camera currently favored by filmmakers with small budgets, and a lovely score punctuated by the slow banjo that dominates Missouri folk culture.\n\n“Winter’s Bone,” like the best neo-realist works, satisfies a deep hunger for an intimately novelistic knowledge of the daily lives of others. “I was a little overwhelmed by how faithful the film is to the novel,” Mr. Woodrell, the author, wrote in an e-mail message. “This is a subculture, not the culture of the Ozarks, but Debra’s style works really well for the material, without false notes or condescension.”\n\nMs. Granik is a natural collaborator. In rehearsal for “Winter’s Bone,” she took a loose, improvisational approach with a canny blend of local residents and professional actors, among them Sheryl Lee (“Twin Peaks”) and John Hawkes (“The Perfect Storm”). “Any time I get cranky about this business, I think of Debra,” said Ms. Farmiga, who was inspired by Ms. Granik to improvise out of her own experience growing up in a working-class family in upstate New York, and to develop a film of her own “in a very ‘Down to the Bone’ way, very cinéma vérité, super-low budget.”\n\nYet for all of Ms. Granik’s attention to authentic detail, in “Winter’s Bone” she flexes new muscles to honor the novel’s genre overlay, its embrace of macabre black comedy, thrillers and fairy tales. “With Daniel I always feel like there’s a wink in this novel,” Ms. Granik said. “He’s got three sisters, and a beautiful legacy from Antigone. If Ree’s father is there, she’s going to bury him, and she has to go deep into the woods to redeem herself.”\n\nLike Alice in some gothic Wonderland, Ms. Lawrence looks like a blond innocent, and her Ree keeps falling down metaphorical holes that diminish her until she learns how to stand tall. That may be why one of Ms. Granik’s future dream projects is a tween-girl movie about witches, “only using real herbal knowledge and having some of the older witches be wise, excellent crones.”\n\nThe honed agility with genre evident in “Winter’s Bone” is a significant advance for Ms. Granik, but she still positions herself within what she called “late-breaking global neo-realism.” Reeling off as major influences Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Shane Meadows, the Dardenne brothers, Laurent Cantet, Abbas Kiarostami and a number of African filmmakers, she notes with envy the financial support these filmmakers receive from their governments. Both of Ms. Granik’s films have won major awards, but when it comes to domestic financing and distribution, she still struggles in what she wryly terms “the awkward third-world conditions for independent film in the United States.”\n\nMs. Granik’s movies are entering a marketplace cluttered with films made cheaply with digital technology, yet competing for entry in an industry that is limping through what James Schamus, the chief executive of Focus Features, called “the final rinse cycle of hedge-fund equity.” Mr. Schamus, who wrote the screenplay for Ang Lee’s 1999 film “Ride With the Devil,” based on another novel by Mr. Woodrell, said of “Winter’s Bone” that it “really does play like a thriller without ever tipping its hand.”\n\nIn an unusual move, “Down to the Bone” was released by the Los Angeles art-house exhibitor Gregory Laemmle and the publicist Steven Zeller. It didn’t stay long in theaters  Ms. Granik agrees that the American temperament, with its emphasis on progress and upward mobility, doesn’t easily tolerate bleak tales of class suffering  nor did its critical success ease Ms. Granik’s path to her second feature film, after a break to have a child.\n\nStill, after winning the grand jury and screenwriting awards, as well as rave reviews, at Sundance, “Winter’s Bone” was picked up by Roadside Attractions for what one of the company’s co-presidents, Howard Cohen, discreetly called “a medium six-figure advance.” Hoping for the same relatively robust box office as the similarly themed indie “Frozen River,” the company will release Ms. Granik’s film on June 11 as counterprogramming to the studio summer blockbusters. “If this film makes $5 million,” Mr. Cohen said, “we’ll be delighted.”"
