        "text": "Remember in 2019, when my favorite movies were ones that you had heard of?\n\nNo?\n\nFair enough. I am probably a little more invested in this than you are.\n\nMy Favorite Dramas of 2023\n\nFour Daughters\n\nInside the Yellow Cocoon Shell\n\nMay December\n\nShowing Up\n\nFour Daughters, which received a surprise Oscar nomination for Best Documentary, is a direct descendent of one of my all-time favorite films, Abbas Kiarostami’s Close-Up. Both act as intimate windows into family life in Middle Eastern countries, telling their stories through re-enactments by the family members, and showing us how the stories continue progress through the very act of creating those re-enactments. When Close-Up was released in 1990, this was a revolutionary method, but one that felt not like a gimmick, but as the most authentic way of telling a delicate story. That it came from theocratic Iran stunned the film community and thrust Kiarastomi into arthouse cinema superstardom. Per Sight and Sound’s definitive poll, directors now consider Close-Up one of the ten best films ever made.\n\nOne way that Four Daughters diverges from its predecessor is in the tangible, real world stakes of its story (ISIS is involved). Four Daughters could work just as well as a scripted film or a prestige television series, not least because Olfa Hamrouni, the family’s matriarch, is an exceptionally complex and compelling central character. She is a hardened woman, often forcing her severities on to her daughters in ways that will be highly objectionable to the Western viewer. Other times, Olfa’s brazen attitude results in moments of laugh-out-loud comedy. Her shell cracks numerous times: sometimes the magnitude of her difficulties overwhelm her; other times because the filmmakers challenge her behavior directly. Four Daughters has gotten a pass for using some of the most ethically questionable techniques you are likely ever to see on film — the result is wrenching. This is filmmaking as radical trauma therapy. Not film as therapy, but filmmaking; we are behind the scenes here. Four Daughters is a worthy successor to Kiarostami and my Favorite Documentary of 2023 🏆❗️.\n\nKelly Reichardt continues to make movies on her own singular elevated plane. Showing Up is an homage to artists as everyday adults — not striving for prominence, but steadfastly sharing their visions in spite of the inexorable challenges brought by friends, family, and life in general. Reichardt specializes in unassuming but devastatingly profound films, and, to my mind, Showing Up is the pinnacle of that incongruous combination.\n\nI’ve always had respect for Todd Haynes’ films, but I have struggled to connect with them. The most common criticism is that his films are academic — more enjoyable to discuss than to watch. I felt that way about Superstar, I’m Not There, probably Far From Heaven, and perhaps even Safe. My bigger issue has been his trademark tethering of melodrama and formalism. I am drawn to realism, and his films often strike me as inauthentic. Similarly, I’ve always thought his many-time collaborator Julianne Moore was something of a ham. At a minimum, her performances feel affected. In this sense, they are a good fit for one another, but until now, they haven’t been for me.\n\nIn May December, form matches function. The story is about people who are faking it. Moore’s Gracie has an affected manner because her character has built a life on…not a lie, but a truth that she won’t admit. Natalie Portman’s Elizabeth, an actor who has been cast to portray Gracie in an upcoming film, is ultimately revealed to live in her own cynically constructed reality. The dynamic between them reaches heights of intensity that remain under veil. It’s a study in restraint; a study in faking it. Charles Melton’s Joe is even more compelling, a stable father of high school and college age children, realizing — several layers beneath the surface — that he missed those years himself. Melton gave my Favorite Supporting Performance of the year🏆❗️, and the cast, full of true supporting performances as well, was my Favorite Ensemble of 2023 🏆❗.\n\nMy Favorite Film of 2023 🏆❗️ is Phạm Thiên Ân’s debut feature Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell. It is a movie that left me near speechless, so I will borrow from Robert Daniels, of RogerEbert.com:\n\nRecalling the work of Apichatpong Weerasethakul, there are too many astounding compositions — frames within frames, piercing depths of field, revelatory moments that arouse the viewer toward rapturous awe — to count. There are too many daring and deft editing choices to believe. Each scene is a filmic victory.\n\nJosh Larsen of the long-running, still indispensable Filmspotting podcast provided a nice spoiler free description of the plot: “(the central character) doesn’t so much go on an existential journey as an existential journey comes to him.”\n\nI saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Ân did not make it to Toronto, but producer Jeremy Chua, looking much younger than his 35 years, gave one of the most memorable Q&As I have ever had the pleasure to witness. “I was the oldest one involved with this movie!” he told us, still in palpable glee and astonishment some four months after Cocoon Shell’s Camera D’Or winning debut at Cannes, “They were a bunch of kids!”\n\nHe told us that the filmmakers had so little money that they had to shoot the film over several years, and that Ân had been studying computer programming before dropping out to go into film. Chua continued to delight the audience: “He was going to lead normal, boring life!”\n\nIn an interview, Ân expanded on his unusual path:\n\nI found work as a wedding videographer. I worked for a company, and they taught me neat things like camera shots, camera movements, composition and structure — stuff like that. I was with them for four years, and then I started my own company with some friends. After a while, wedding videos became repetitive and limited, so we wanted something more interesting. Cinema became my calling.\n\nWedding videographers rejoice!\n\nInside the Yellow Cocoon Shell is getting a North American theatrical release, which will certainly be limited to very large cities. If you have the opportunity, I beg you to see it on the big screen. Hell, shoot me a message; I might go with you.\n\nThe last question for Chua at the Q&A was, “What’s next for you?” His answer was so incongruous with his otherwise cheerful tone that it took several moments to register. “I’m making commercials now. I like movies like this, but I can’t make a living.”\n\nIndependent filmmaking is hard. It took 12 years after Reichardt’s first film to make her second, and she did so on a minuscule budget. Todd Haynes’ first movie was made with dolls, for goodness sake, and for many years it was available only by bootleg because it violated IP. Filmmakers like these and the people who support them — everyone in those long lists of credits — give so much. I am so very appreciative of them.\n\nMy Two Favorite Comedies of the Decade So Far\n\nBottoms\n\nThe Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed\n\nExcuse me in advance for giving the lamest critical blurb ever: Bottoms reinvents the teen comedy for the 21st Century 😀. Ugh! But it does! The basic plot — two lesbian high schoolers start a Fight Club for girls in an attempt to get laid — points to both affection and subversion of the movies of the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nRachel Sennott, cowriter and star, is a tour de force of comedy and charisma on the level of Chevy Chase in his prime. Unlike Chase, or two dozen other SNL alumni flashes in the pan, Sennott has already proven her versatility and depth as an actor in Shiva Baby, which, like Bottoms, was directed by Emma Seligman.\n\nNote that Sennott is young enough to be playing a high schooler! I suspect that she will be a household name very soon.\n\nSpeaking of genre reinventions, Joanna Arnow’s The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed is a take on young-person-who-isn’t-all-that-motivated-but-is-trying-to-find-her-way comedy. Think Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Tiny Furniture or Frances Ha.\n\nThe previously obscure Arnow is a rare talent — writing, directing, editing, and starring in this comic masterpiece. And do not underrate “editing.” First, editing is a massive part of the creative process that not many directors take on alone. Second, her editing is scintillating. “Scintillating editing,” you scoff? Yes. Even if “scintillating” feels like exactly the wrong word in this deadest of deadpan comedies. The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed feels different than anything I’ve ever seen — in kind, not degree. It is an easy winner of my Favorite Editing of the Year 🏆❗️.\n\nNot sold on this one ? Here is one of Arnow’s shorts. It’s not on a level with The Feeling That…, but it will give you an idea of whether you will absolutely hate it, which I’m sure plenty of people will.\n\n[Respect where it’s due: Phạm Thiên Ân and Kelly Reichardt also edited their films.]\n\nMore Movies I Loved\n\nAsteroid City\n\nThe Boy and the Heron\n\nLa Chimera\n\nThe Deepest Breath\n\nHow to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\nIt’s Coming\n\nKing Von: Rap’s First Serial Killer\n\nPoor Things\n\nPriscilla\n\nA Still Small Voice\n\nI caught the world premiere of How to Blow Up a Pipeline on the festival circuit in 2022, then broke my own rule and didn’t include it in my Year in Film essay. I knew that it was getting a broad release in 2023. I thought it was going to be a hit, so I figured I would wait a year. It made about $1 million worldwide, which is quite good for an indie, but that is far from being a box office hit. It’s disappointing, because if you’re looking for smart, original, edge of your seat entertainment — well, then thank you for visiting my blog, because I don’t specialize in that. But I digress. How to Blow Up a Pipeline delivers.\n\nThe Deepest Breath is another commercial film that I loved. It’s a documentary about free diving. I produce documentaries and I free dive, so maybe I’m not the perfect judge on this one, but I’m willing to bet $10 that you’ll like it. Available on Netflix.\n\nI, for one, love that Wes Anderson keeps digging deeper and deeper into what he does. The cost of his radical commitment to style is high; as engaged as I was by every moment of Asteroid City, I would be lying if I said I remember a whole lot about the details. I suspect that Anderson puts great care into his themes, but with his characters so flattened, their travails lack substance, and I don’t find myself emotionally moved. I felt the same way about The French Dispatch. I loved the experience of watching it, but it just kind of came and went for me. I think that Wes Anderson is my version of a comfort food movie, I mean that as a compliment, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels that way.\n\nPriscilla revels in its narrowness. Like so many of my favorite movies, it presents to the audience a thing that happened, surprising but real, and allows us to make or not make our own judgments. It narrowly beats out Maestro, Poor Things, and May December for my Favorite Art Department of 2023 🏆❗️ (while I am not nearly as high on 2023 as many professional critics, on pure aesthetics the year was a smash!).\n\nIt’s Coming, like Priscilla, is unusually intimate, and acts as a case study in showing not telling. These are their only similarities. It’s Coming is a documentary that captures the experience of a family that believes it is being haunted by ghosts. The filmmakers don’t insert commentary or betray cynicism. In fact, they seem pretty freaked out! I’m a skeptic through and through, but I was absorbed into this movie. I’d be interested in hearing a take from someone who believes in ghosts.\n\nLuke Loretzen, with only three films under his belt, has proven himself to be one of the most sensitive and versatile documentarians working today. His 2019 feature Midnight Family is a fast-paced drama, with Loretzen embedded with a family who run a private ambulance that literally races other private ambulances to medical emergencies in Mexico City. As its title indicates, his 2023 follow-up A Still Small Voice is as different from that as one could imagine. The film features Mati Engel, a chaplain completing a year of training at Mount Sinai Hospital where she — an atheist — provides spiritual support to patients and families who are in mourning or extreme distress. There is a plot that involves a conflict between Mati and her boss. They are both very good people, and the emotional pressure of what they do for a living is clearly taking a toll. The heart and soul of this movie, though, are the still, small moments that belie enormous drama — people, who in the most difficult circumstances of their lives, allowed cameras in to capture Mati’s counseling. My Favorite Scene of 2023 🏆❗️ is Mati consoling the young Christian couple.\n\nI used to be really, really into rap music. I mean, so much that I got made fun of in the high school cafeteria. Nowadays, I mostly discover rappers when they I read about their deaths in the New York Times. And that happens all too often. Lil Peep, Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion, and Nipsey Hussle have each spent from between a week to up to a few months in my Spotify rotation. Oh, and I listened to Kendrick Lamar for a bit, so I am also getting hip hop recommendations from the Pulitzer Committee. If you hadn’t guessed it yet, you are reading the blog of a middle-aged white man.\n\nAs much as hip hop music hasn’t maintained an urgent appeal to me as I’ve gotten older, the lives of rappers are almost always documentary-worthy level interesting. King Von’s life was something between a video game and a horror movie.\n\nKing Von: Rap’s First Serial Killer is an investigation of the deceased Chicago rapper. “Investigation” is the keyword. The movie is straightforward: this skinny, white British guy with a funny haircut named “Trap Lore Ross” spent a gargantuan number of hours poring through the online trail of the murdered rapper. His findings justify the three-hour, thirty-seven minute runtime. Von, a member of the Black Disciples, was drawn into the rap game by the chart-topping rapper Lil Durk for littler reason other than that he was a gangsta hit man. Like Eazy-E before him, he had the look and the street cred, and developed the rapping skills later.\n\nWhat makes this movie fascinating — indeed, shocking — is that King Von appears to have murdered ten people and boasted about it both online and in his songs. He would call out the people he killed or was planning to kill by name in lyrics and on social media. The most disturbing section of the film is when Ross shows online text conversations with K.I., a girl in the Gangster Disciples, a rival gang. They segue from shit-talking to flirtation to promises to murder one another. On April 11, 2020, K.I. was waiting for a bus at the 6400 block of South Eberhart Avenue when Von walked up to her, pulled out his handgun, and shot her nine times. K.I. was 17 and suspected of committing over a dozen murders at the time of her death.\n\nDavid Simon said he named his show The Wire not so much because the police on the show were using wire taps, but because the show was the audience’s way to eavesdrop on otherwise secret worlds. The wire that KV:RFSK provides shows that Von’s real life “O Block” in the south side of Chicago is at least as dangerous as Simon’s fictionalized Baltimore. But O Block is pettier. Von’s homicidal behaviour appears to have been fueled much more by ego than by money.\n\nThat human beings live like this in America is a national shame of proportions that can’t be overstated. A chunk of our population lives in what are, for practical as well as statistical purposes, war zones. I know this isn’t news to anyone, but to spend three and a half hours appreciating the depth of hopelessness mixed with hedonism in which Von and K.I. lived their lives is almost too much to absorb. That it all happens in the same projects in which Michelle Obama spent her early years strikes me as even sadder.\n\nMovies I Liked\n\nAgainst the Tide\n\nAggro Dr1ft\n\nAmerican Symphony\n\nBeyond Utopia\n\nBlackberry\n\nCemetery of Cinema\n\nClose Your Eyes\n\nConfessions of a Good Samaritan\n\nDream Scenario\n\nKim’s Video\n\nThe Menu\n\nThe Mission\n\nReality\n\nSwan Song\n\nThank You Very Much\n\nI apologize to my regular readers, but I have to say this every year: as far down this list as we appear to be, these are all very good movies.\n\nYou’ve likely heard that Blackberry and Dream Scenario are really good, and you haven’t been led astray.\n\nSwan Song is better than the best documentary about the Canadian National Ballet that I could imagine.\n\nClose Your Eyes might be a future classic.\n\nAggro Dr1ft definitely is an instant classic. Sure, it’s the most one-dimensional film ever made, but damn it’s cool.\n\nI love when documentaries serve as genre films. Beyond Utopia is a rare documentary-thriller. It follows a family’s escape from North Korea, a place where the more you know about it, the more mind-blowing it is that it actually exists. If Beyond Utopia’s hero Pastor Seungeun Kim were Catholic, he’d be well on the way to Sainthood.\n\nThank You Very Much is the definitive Andy Kaufman documentary and will hopefully be released in 2024. Kaufman was one of the most unique celebrities we’ve ever had. If you care about comedy or liked Jim Carrey’s Man on the Moon, it’s can’t-miss.\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy is so goddamn entrancing that I can’t assess The Menu on its merits. I’m pretty sure it was good fun. We’ll find out a lot more about her range this year as she stars in the Mad Max sequel Furiosa.\n\nIf I had three wishes, one of them would be to see Taylor-Joy paired with the strikingly dissimilar but equally talented rising superstar Sydney Sweeney, who anchors the fascinating Reality. Reality’s dialogue is composed entirely of the transcript of a real-time conversation between whistleblower Reality Winner and her FBI interlocutors…and it works.\n\nThe Oscar Contenders\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nBarbie\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPast Lives\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nHollywood’s top story this year was Barbenheimer, and I am very happy that whole thing happened. My concern for the future of movie theaters is well-established. People showing up for non-sequel/”Universe” movies is what so many of us have yearned for and the crowds that Barbenheimer brought back to the multiplex were heartening. But Oppenheimer, both the movie itself and its positioning as the saviour of movies for grown-ups, is a façade.\n\nA lot of people noticed that the plot that takes over the last hour of Oppenheimer is simply not very interesting. Robert Oppenheimer loses his security clearance. The horror! And did I really give an hour of my life over to whether Lewis Strauss (“Who?” say even people who saw the movie) would be appointed Secretary of Commerce in 1959? Yes, we all did. The fact that these remarkably low-stakes stories followed one of the highest-stakes stories in the history of humanity was…. well, actually, it was kind of fitting because without any characters tying us directly to World War II, Hiroshima or Nagasaki, the core story of Oppenheimer wasn’t exactly captivating either! Oppenheimer’s breakthrough, which strikes fear in my heart, was that it was an entire movie — a three-hour movie — edited as if it were a trailer. Yes, this was a movie for adults about the most serious of subjects, but it was a commercial success specifically because it didn’t have faith in its audience’s ability to pay attention. By embracing ADHD and stuffing itself full of cameos of famous actors in mostly interchangeable roles, it created an illusion of momentum and intrigue.\n\nAnother reason for Oppenheimer’s success was, of course, its media-driven pairing with Barbie. I saw Barbie, and it was plenty good, but I’m a straight adult male who didn’t even have sisters growing up. This movie was not meant for me. It was original, though, it was a visual spectacle, and it was funny enough to be an ideal background movie while I answered emails. Does that place me on the right side of the curmudgeon line? I hope so because that’s the best I’ve got.\n\nAnatomy of a Fall is a very strong episode of Law and Order. I mean, like really, really above par. That it is widely considered one of the best movies in the world this year is curious to me.\n\nThe Zone of Interest, which depicts the perspective of a Nazi concentration camp Commandant Rudolf Höss and his wife Hedwig, is my favorite of tonight’s nominees. Like director Jonathan Glazer’s last film Under the Skin, you could describe it in two sentences and capture most of the plot. Both are best appreciated as immersive experiences in which intellectual comprehension is a thin layer. These movies are stylistically two of a kind as well: eerie, contained, and cold, with moments of abstraction. The difference, and it is a giant one, is that The Zone of Interest actually happened.\n\n[Indirect spoiler in the next paragraph]\n\nThe ending of The Zone of Interest is unfortunate. It explicitly and unnecessarily nods to the present day, and is taken as directly as conceivable from the documentary The Act of Killing. The film works so well as an enclosed piece that each of these decisions feel not so much unnecessary, though they are, but inappropriate. In The Act of Killing, we build up to that moment — which I will describe only as a moment of realization — deliberately over the course of a feature length character study. People making moral leaps is something that happens in movies; when The Act of Killing shows this happen in real life, and in fact, makes it happen through the very process of filmmaking, it is shocking and emotionally overwhelming. Unless I missed it (quite possible) in Zone, the moment happens with no build-up. This makes it not just out of place, but a contradiction of the very meaning of the film. David Mamet said of Schindler’s List, “its moral poverty lies in that it claims to be a teaching tool to prevent something like the Holocaust from occuring again, when in fact all it does is give the audience reassurance that they would never do such a thing.” Providing a learning moment to Höss, a conscience not granted to his compatriots and even his own family, provides a relief to the audience, albeit a very unpleasant one, when it is the normalcy and thus relatability of his life despite its monstrousness that is clearly the entire point of the film!\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon has a Channing Tatum-sized hole in it. He is the man who should have played the dumb, handsome lunk Ernest Burkhart. How was Leonardo DiCaprio miscast in this movie? Let us count the ways. First, Leo can’t play dumb. Just look at the poster: what emotion do you read there? This is not a depiction of a character, it is a depiction of Leonardo DiCaprio being very, very serious. Second, Leo can’t play tough. De Niro is great as King William Hale, but Hale’s domination of the dangerous Jack Dawson doesn’t strike fear in our hearts because Dawson, despite committing multiple murders, doesn’t feel at all dangerous. Third, Leo can’t play depth. Not anymore. This character was written as a blank slate and Leo doesn’t fill it in. Fourth, Leo lacks chemistry with Lily Gladstone. He’s one of the most handsome men of his generation, but the whole movie I was thinking, why is she with this guy?\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street played to Leo’s strengths: he is charming and a little bit of a rogue. Wolf is the exception that proves the rule. To varying extents, almost the entirety of the second half of Scorsese’s career — perhaps our greatest director! — has been blunted by DiCaprio’s limits. Thank fucking God that he wasn’t in Silence.\n\nLeaning heavily on the immense likability of Jeffrey Wright, American Fiction deftly calls out white liberals’ condescension toward Black people while somehow still catering to those same liberals’ conceits. It’s a tough needle to thread, and it works if you squint. Is our hero Monk’s novel “Fuck” née “My Pafology” more offensive than “We’s Be From the Ghetto,” the book that Monk is supposedly parodying? No, but “Pafology” and “Fuck” both make for good laugh lines! By the end, the author of “We’s Be from the Ghetto” is let off the hook, and by extension, the white audience is as well.\n\nThe achievement of Maestro as capital F Filmmaking belied a genuinely odd structural quirkiness, and I’m not sure if it was on purpose. That first act… OK, some people can’t get enough homages to the golden age of Hollywood and Broadway, but still, wasn’t it weird to watch a movie that went 45 minutes without any conflict? It felt a bit like Licorice Pizza — you’re just hanging out with charming people of a different era on beautiful, impressively realistic sets. I appreciated the color part of the movie much more, even as the conflict remains muted and most of the dramas of Bernstein’s life are left unsaid. In Priscilla, narrowness was built into every frame of the film — even in Priscilla’s paparazzi moment, you know the story is about her internal experience. With Maestro, everything except the throughline plot is as big as possible. My take was that Maestro was saying, “Marriage is hard, but ultimately, the person you spend the most time with is the most important thing in your life.” It is a simple but profound message that’s too unsexy for most people to make movies about. Perhaps it was saying that all the grandness makes a relationship that much harder.\n\nFor clarity, “capital F Filmmaking” is a bit backhanded, but it is a compliment . Maestro excelled in production design, acting, sound, and, more than anything else, makeup. Movies have been aging actors with makeup for over 100 years. This movie was the first time it ever felt 100% real. Maestro wins my Favorite Makeup of 2023 🏆❗️.\n\nFriends’ Movies\n\nAmelia’s Children\n\nThe American Gladiators Documentary\n\nThe Artifice Girl\n\nThe Sweet East\n\nWe Are Guardians\n\nWhen I know a person with a prominent role on the filmmaking team, I don’t rate or offer commentary. I do, however, implicitly endorse each of these movies, and would enjoy discussing.\n\nBy-the-Books Documentaries\n\nBeing Mary Tyler Moore\n\nBuried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche\n\nCall Me Kate\n\nIn Restless Dreams: The Music of Paul Simon\n\nNam June Paik: Moon is the Oldest TV\n\nRadical Wolfe\n\nWHAM!\n\nAll of these are worth watching if you are interested in the subject matter, which in all cases here, is pretty great stuff.\n\nI Didn’t Actively Dislike These Movies, But I Can’t Actively Recommend Them\n\nBeau is Afraid\n\nBlind Willow, Sleeping Woman\n\nThe Contestant\n\nFauna\n\nInfinity Pool\n\nThe Killer\n\nMaster Gardener\n\nThese movies are mostly auteur films that didn’t quite deliver for me. In each case, I applaud the effort.\n\nThe exception is The Contestant, a documentary about a Japanese game show that, by all modern definitions, literally tortured its participant. Much of reality television is something like the NFL — people are hurt for our entertainment, and we collectively turn a blind eye. Of course in the NFL, they are paid millions of dollars and represented by managers and agents who, in theory, are watching out for them. Reality TV is often wildly exploitative. Being both entertainment and an exposé is an incredibly tricky task. Despite its good intentions, The Contestant’s liberal use of the silly and outrageous footage of the original Japanese show downplays an appalling reality. The movie wants us to feel sympathy for its hero and pass judgement on its villian, but it also wants to make us laugh. Another 2023 film, 30 for 30’s The American Gladiators Documentary, thread that needle. I laughed; I cared; I felt like something similar was less likely to happen in the future. The Contestant made me feel that I’d made things worse.\n\nFollowing up Hereditary and Midsommar debatably the best two horror films of the past ten years, Ari Aster’s Beau is Afraid amounts to a MacArthur Genius Grant poorly spent. Yes, the first 45 minutes were a hilarious and wildly original depiction of anxiety, and the middle 90 minutes got a mixed reception, but I liked it. The exact moment to stop watching Beau is Afraid is when the thing you’ve been wondering if you would see happen does happen but very differently than expected. The end is important in all things, and 40 minutes is much too long to spend in a bad ending. Unless you have maaaajor mommy issues you want to dig into (TMI, Ari! TMI!) , just press “stop” at that moment and you’ll have seen a unique, intense movie with a crazy twist ending.\n\nI mean, you’re obviously not going to do that. Who has that sort of will power? If you do, though, we’ll have that little bond of faith for the rest of our lives, and believe me, having that bond will be better than the last 40 minutes of Beau is Afraid.\n\nThese Ones I Just Did Not Like\n\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life\n\nFingernails\n\nForms of Forgetting\n\nThe Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker\n\nMusic\n\nSpirit of Ecstasy\n\nI was tempted to accuse Beau is Afraid of wearing the influence of the great Charlie Kaufman too nakedly on its sleeve. Fingernails, though, shows us what a rip-off really is. The fact that Fingernails splits the difference by stealing from two brilliant filmmakers (Kaufman and Yorgos Lanthimos) is no defense. I had set Riz Ahmed on quite a high pedestal before Fingernails. He has proven repeatedly (The Night Of…, The Sound of Metal, Night Crawler) that he can play intensity as well as anyone, but this was theoretically a romantic comedy. Sparks do not fly.\n\nDid Albert Brooks ever produce anything in his life that did not change the culture as we know it? Not according to Albert Brooks: Defending My Life. Honestly, I love Brooks so much that I could almost forgive an entire movie of sycophantic praise. A bigger issue is the movie’s framing device: a conversation between Brooks and his lifelong best friend Rob Reiner, (director of Spinal Tap, and The Princess Bride, amongst many others) over dinner at an empty restaurant. Sometimes ideas don’t work, and it’s unfortunate that everyone involved had too much respect for these two legends to send them back to the drawing room.\n\nA Bad Film\n\nLil Nas X: Long Live Montero\n\nOver the last few years, a distressing amount of the air in the room for documentaries has been sucked in by “vanity docs.” These are films about major stars painted in an almost entirely flattering light. Even the requisite disagreeable moment ultimately shows the humanity of our hero. We’re talking Sly (Sylvester Stallone), Arnold (Schwarzenegger), (David) Beckham, and Miss America (Taylor Swift). Fans want to worship their heroes, so audiences lap it up, and both the subject and the filmmakers get big paychecks. The only losers are the discerning audience (are you just figuring out that I’m a film snob?) and documentarians who aim to create inspired cinema. After all, most all celebrities remarkable people who have lead interesting lives. Great movies could be made about any of them if their PR teams were not filing off of all of their rough edges.\n\nNevertheless, I went into Lil Nas X: Long Live Montero optimistic. Not many black rappers open their careers with a country song. And Lil Nas X’s debut single Old Town Road was no normal country song. It held the number one position longer than any song in the history of Billboard Magazine. Since 1955!\n\nAfter that sleeper of all sleepers, Lil Nas X held nothing back on his first full-length album. The first video portrayed him giving Lucifer an R-rated lap dance and was promoted with a line of customized Nikes called Satan Shoes that had a bronze pentagram, an inverted cross, and an encased drop of real human blood. He was sued by Nike for his efforts. Remarkably, he topped himself with the second video, a celebration of gay men, in general, and prison sex, in particular. Nas gave new life to the classic music video trope of a singer fronting a triangle-shaped dance team — the dancers are sculpted naked black men in a communal shower. Pixelation follows their literal/metaphorical swinging dicks. It isn’t easy to shock these days, but Lil Nas X was doing it.\n\nWhile Nas seemed so clearly seemed to be aspiring to subversiveness, the team behind Long Live Montero was not. The closest thing to a conflict in this movie is that Lil Nas X is queer, like approximately 30% of his generation. His parents were upset about it for days. The movie goes on to show fundamentalist Christians picketing outside one of his shows. It does not mention he was literally promoting Satan at the time. Rather, the viewer is led to believe that the protestors are simply upset with his homosexuality. I mean, I’m sure they were, but Christians were upset that David Bowie was gay 50 freaking years ago. Nas very clearly picked a fight, and instead of addressing the very modest blowback, he blatantly misrepresents it in order to flatter his audience’s moral superiority.\n\nLast but not least, even the weakest vanity docs tend to be very good at giving you the impression that the artist they portray is wildly talented. Lil Nas X: Long Live Montero leaves the impression that our hero caught a wave at the exact right moment and is now riding an even larger wave of record company money. And again, I went in optimistic!\n\nHe does seem like a pretty good guy, though. I hope he doesn’t read this.\n\nMy Favorite TV Show of 2023\n\nI closed my Year in Film last year with a shout out to The Rehearsal, Nathan Fielder’s morally dubious, genre-twisting HBO Series. Stunningly, Fielder’s new series, The Curse, co-created with Benny Safdie, is much better.\n\nAs future anthropologists search through the detritus of files deteriorating on servers marked “2023,” trying to figure out how 2024 happened (I’m not feeling real optimistic), one can only hope that they find The Curse. As American Fiction runs from its convictions, The Curse jumps in headfirst, dragging its characters, its audience, and even its makers into its vortex. Are Whitney and Asher Siegel (Emma Stone and Fielder) exaggerations? Maybe. Let’s say they are extreme cases, but they don’t know that, and that obliviousness, depicted so excruciatingly (and so spot-on) in every contact they have with someone who is not inside their bubble, makes them the definitive versions of We, the Privileged.\n\nMy Favorite Lead Performance of 2023 🏆❗is from Emma Stone. I am loathe to bequeath one of my few, wildly influential Awards 🏆❗ to a work made entirely for television and streaming, but as much as any series, The Curse’s ten hours are of a single piece (to their great credit, the Tiff Bell Lightbox theater in Toronto screened the series in its entirety over the course of the season). The Curse is visionary — packed with ideas, visually innovative, sensitive to its characters, visually gorgeous and surprising, subtle and then Biblical, insightful but mysterious. It would have been my show of the year with simply a capable lead performance, but Emma Stone is astounding. She conveys 1,000 different thoughts and emotions completely realistically, often several at the same time.\n\nThe Curse is available on Paramount-Plus, easily justifying the price of an actually pretty darn good streaming service.\n\nWell, there you go. I hope this was worth 25 minutes of your time, because oh boy, did I put enough of my own time into it. See you next year, and remember, movies are better in theaters.
