        "text": "Unlike the last few plays that this class has read, The Tempest wasn’t a tragedy that ended in a malicious murder. No one was stabbed, committed suicide, or went crazy. Instead there was a theme of reconciliation in the play. Because of Prospero’s ability to bury the hatchet with the person that wronged him, he really set the tone for the end of the play and what the future looks like. Now instead of my original idea that Propsero would study magic and hold a grudge until the end of his life, I think that he has realized that there are bigger things in life than magic. We can see evidence of this mindset in the play during the epilogue when Prospero is standing alone on stage. During his monologue he announces that he will totally give up on magic (V.i.169.1-15). The action of giving up on something that played such a large part in his life shows that he is ready to move onto things that he finds more important. He now has a soon to be son-in-law, and probably wants to be a part in his daughters life. In order to make sure that happens, Prospero has to prove that he can resolve and talk big issues out instead of resorting to the violence involved with magic. This is not to say that Prospero has totally forgiven the people that have wronged him. However Miranda’s father did exhibit a large change attitudes. Jan Frans Van Dijkhuizen explores this idea of forgiveness in his article entitled “ Shakespeare and the Grammar of Forgiveness.” There he talks about a great example of Prospero’s change in attitude and how he no longer tries to demonstrate or hold his power over people. Before he forgave people at the end of the play Prospero had no problem exercising his power and telling servants or anyone below him what to do. This might be because he was full of so much anger from his brother betraying him that he took it out on everyone else. Van Dijkhuizen says that the change might’ve happened after Ariel alluded to a psychological and magical release from bonds. (5.1.142.12-14). Prospero might need to let go of his thirst for revenge in order to release the prisoners. By Prospero releasing the anger he felt towards the prisoners he was effectivly forgiving them for what they did. It wasn’t total forgiveness but it was a change in attitude that really changed the tone of the play and pushed it out of the tragedy category.\n\nAs I stated previously, Prospero won’t go back to Naples with the intent to rule the kingdom anymore also because it was never what he wanted in the first place. In the first act Prospero told his daughter his side of how the coup d’état took place (1.2.17.84-96). This new perspective shows the audience that from the very beginning Prospero ignored his people by becoming engrossed in his magic books. This is why it made complete sense to me that he was overthrown. He was completely ignoring the people of his kingdom and shirking his duties. In light of this, it is hard to believe that while he was away from the kingdom that he developed an interest in the affairs of the people he left behind. Spending twelve years away from Naples has probably only made Prospero less inclined to rule the country, not more so. Had Prospero expressed his interest in the countries affairs or how he would want to run the situation now I would’ve understood how Prospero would want to go back to the Naples and claim the throne again. However, what happened instead was his obsession with magic and learning more of it. As the audience knows this eventually led to him fleeing the country and ending up on the island.\n\nWhile it is fun to try and speculate how Prospero will conduct himself when he gets back, I don’t think it is all that hard to imagine. He is a person that has been many different things in his long life. Now that he is nearing the end it is hard to imagine him wanting to do anything to radical. Instead I think that he wants to reflect on his life and try and enjoy the few moments that he has left before he dies. This idea of reflection really falls in line with Erik Erikson’s psychology theory that life development is a lifelong process. He believed that personality develops through a series of eight stages as life unfolds. In the case of The Tempest, Prospero is reaching the last stage that involves reflection back on your life. The part of this stage that\n\nis relevant to the play is that regret can be a large part of this stage. If someone lives an unproductive and regretful past they become dissatisfied with their life. By solving the issues of regret the person can look back on their life and accept what happened more easily. Prospero solved the large issue of regret by being able to talk to the person that caused him so much strife and address the idea. Now that closure over a twelve year problem is no longer a problem , I think that Prospero can focus on paying attention to his family when he gets back. It was also never a question in my mind that Prospero would want to try and be with his family after heading to Naples because he was so happy and supportive Miranda’s relationship. That action helped to show that family does play an important life in his and his daughters life. While Prospero did try to use their relationship to his advantage, that doesn’t take away from the fact that his daughter and what she is doing will probably affect what Prospero does in Naples."
