BURY THE HATCHET is a portrait of three Mardi Gras Indian "Big Chiefs" of New Orleans, descendants of runaway slaves taken in long ago by the Native Americans of the Louisiana bayous. Once plagued by intertribal violence, today these African-American tribes take to the backstreets of New Orleans on Mardi Gras, dressed in elaborate Native-American influenced costumes they've sewn over the course of the year.
