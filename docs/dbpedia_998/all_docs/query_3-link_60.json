        "text": "Dinah Shore has gotten used to it by now. When most people meet her for the first time, it is not her nine gold records they remark about or her distinguished 30-year television career or how she has appeared several times on the annual Gallup poll of the 10 most admired women in the world.\n\nWhat seems to impress people the most about the former Frances Rose Shore of Winchester, Tenn., is how terrific she looks, not to mention her vitality and her obvious joy of living. At the age of 64 (according to most biographical sources), she seems to have scarcely changed since her first network television series, ''The Dinah Shore Show,'' on NBC-TV in 1951.\n\nOh, her hair has gotten progressively blonder over the years - it was almost black when she and another unknown singer, Frank Sinatra, began their careers in 1938 at radio station WNEW, New York - and she has added a few laugh lines around the eyes. But, perhaps more than anyone else in the entertainment business, Dinah Shore seems to have discovered some sort of youth-and-happiness pill. While many female performers her age have been relegated to the wings, she keeps right on working.\n\nJoking About Her Age\n\nAlthough she will not confirm her age - the Who's Who sketch she supplied gives her birth date as March 1, 1921 - she jokes about it in the same informal, low-key manner that she uses with her guests on the television shows. ''To tell you the absolute truth, I was born in 1937,'' she said in her familiar Tennessee drawl, ''and if you print that then you'll be my new best friend.''\n\nMiss Shore, dressed simply in a white shirt and black pants, was in New York to talk about her forthcoming 10-city concert tour, her first in a decade. She will appear at the Westbury Music Fair in Westbury, L. I., from next Thursday through Sunday. Where else?\n\n''I was frustrated,'' she said, explaining why she stopped doing her 90-minute daily talk show, ''Dinah!'' last August to prepare for the tour. ''I am basically a singer, and I found out that I was doing a lot of talking but singing only two or three times a week, which wasn't enough. If you don't sing enough, you get out of the habit, like a cook who doesn't cook. So now I'm just going to sing my little tonsils to the bone.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
