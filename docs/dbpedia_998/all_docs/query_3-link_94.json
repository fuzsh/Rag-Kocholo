        "text": "Who remembers the Dinah Shore Show?\n\nThe Dinah Shore Show is an American variety show which was broadcast by NBC from November 1951 to January 1956, sponsored by General Motors’ Chevrolet division.\n\nHowever before that Dinah Shore started her own show she made her debut on NBC Blue radio network on August 6th 1939.\n\nWho’s the NBC Blue radio network?\n\nThe Blue Network can be dated as far back as 1923, when the Radio Corporation of America acquired Westinghouse.\n\nWhen RCA commenced operations on August 1, 1923, the root of a network was born, though it did not operate under the name by which it would later become known.\n\nAfter becoming a success with Ben Bernie on network radio, Dinah Shore started her own show on the NBC Blue radio network. Dinah sang every Sunday evening. Dinah also had a successful TV career spanning over two decades.\n\nHer real name was Frances “Fanny” Rose Shore, and she was born in Winchester, Tennessee. Stricken with polio at 18 months of age, she recovered after receiving the Sister Kenny treatment.\n\nShe became a cheerleader at Hume-Fogg High School in Nashville and went on to graduate from Vanderbilt University in 1938, where she majored in sociology.\n\nShe took voice and acting lessons on the side and sang on radio station WSM in Nashville.\n\nIn 1938 she left Tennessee for New York City and began singing on radio station WNCW in New York. Her first recordings were with bandleader Xavier Cugat, and she later changed her named to Dinah after her success with the song of the same name.\n\nToday’s YouTube presentation brought to you by user name Movie Legends, before Dinah Shore had her own show. Dinah Shore was an American singer, film actress, television personality, and the top-charting female vocalist of the 1940s.\n\nShe was the first female star to have her own prime-time TV variety show, and she also had a long love affair with Burt Reynolds, who was 20 years younger than she was.\n\nDinah Shore earned the USO Medallion Award as the first entertainer to visit GIs on the front lines of WWII.\n\nIn the spring of 1993, Shore was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died of the disease on February 24, 1994, at her home in Beverly Hills, California, five days before her 78th birthday. She was cremated that same day, and her ashes were divided between her two memorial sites. Half were interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California, and the other half interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City), near her second home in Palm Springs, California.\n\nHer ex-husband, George Montgomery, and her two children were with her when she died.\n\nDinah Shore Boulevard is named in her honor in her hometown of Winchester, Tennessee, as we celebrate a little bit of the history of Dinah Shore.\n\nWritten & Designed by JD Mitchell\n\njdmitchelldesigns@gmail.com"
