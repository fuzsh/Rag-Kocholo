        "text": "Dinah Shore, a vivacious entertainer who was widely loved for her homey, heartfelt singing and breezy Southern charm, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 76.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said Constance L. Stone, her publicity agent.\n\nMiss Shore's career, which spanned more than 50 years, embraced radio, pop records and television, and reached its zenith in the 1950's and 60's when she appeared four times in a Gallup Poll of the most admired women in the world. Among her many honors were 10 Emmy Awards.\n\nIt was on \"The Dinah Shore Chevy Show,\" a weekly television variety program that ran from 1956 to 1963, that she sang the jingle that would become her unofficial theme, \"See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet.\" From 1970 to 1984, she was the host of several television talk programs, in which her vitality and relaxed rapport with celebrities from all walks of life established her as a forerunner of stars like Oprah Winfrey. A Friend of the Camera\n\n\"I don't know how to be afraid of that old red eye,\" she once said, referring to the television camera. \"It's one person to me. I don't visualize large numbers of people out there. I'm comfortable with it.\"\n\nMiss Shore, whose original name was Frances Rose Shore, was born on March 1, 1917, in Winchester, Tenn. She graduated from Vanderbilt University, where she majored in sociology. While in college, she made her radio debut with a 15-minute program on the Nashville station WSM. The theme song of that program was the 1925 hit song \"Dinah,\" a name she adopted legally in 1944.\n\nIn 1938, Miss Shore came to New York, where she took a singing job with the radio station WNEW. The next year, she secured a two-week engagement singing with Leo Reisman's popular orchestra at the Strand Theater. In 1940, she began to build a national following as a performer on the NBC program \"Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street\" and on Eddie Cantor's program, where she was a regular guest for three years before starting her own program.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
