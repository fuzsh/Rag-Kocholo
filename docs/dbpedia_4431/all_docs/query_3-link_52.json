The whole year uses the same time zone.\n\nThe hours +1h. +2h. etc. o -1h. -2h. etc. which appear to the right side of to the Locality, inticate the Current Time Zone of the Locality just at the time of consultation.\n\nFor example, if the symbol appears on the clock and you want to know the local time zone, the (UTC/GMT), you must subtract one hour (except Lord Howe 30 minutes)\n\nIf the clock shows the symbol it corresponds just with the standard time zone of the locality UTC/GMT, or the winter time.\n\nThe time with the symbol , as well as the winter symbol, corresponds to the local time or standard UTC/GMT time zone, with the difference that the time zone does not change throughout the year.\n\nSome examples with No dst: Hawaii - Iceland - India - Argentina - Peru - Arizona - China - Russia - Venezuela - Ecuador - Sonora - Canc√∫n."
