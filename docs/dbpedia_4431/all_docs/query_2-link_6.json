        "text": "The IEM maintains an ever growing archive of automated airport weather observations from around the world! These observations are typically called 'ASOS' or sometimes 'AWOS' sensors. A more generic term may be METAR data, which is a term that describes the format the data is transmitted as. If you don't get data for a request, please feel free to contact us for help. The IEM also has a one minute interval dataset for US ASOS (2000-) and Iowa AWOS (1995-2011) sites. This archive simply provides the as-is collection of historical observations, very little quality control is done. More details on this dataset are here.\n\nData Sources: The data made available on this page is sourced from a number of places including: Unidata IDD, NCEI ISD, and MADIS One Minute ASOS.\n\n2) Select From Available Data:\n\nNote: Precipitation data is unavailable for non-US sites. The Heat Index/Wind Chill value retroactively use current NWS equations.\n\n3) Select Date Range:\n\nNote: These dates define timestamps starting at midnight of the selected timezone. The start date is inclusive and the end date is exclusive.\n\nStart Date: End Date:\n\n4) Timezone of Observation Times:\n\nThe following options are available for how the observation time is presented.\n\n5) Download Options:\n\nData Format:\n\nInclude Latitude + Longitude?\n\nInclude Elevation (meters)?\n\nHow to represent missing data?\n\nHow to represent Trace reports?\n\n6) Limit Report Types\n\nSee news item on recent changes made for report types. When in doubt, pick both routine and specials.\n\nMADIS HFMETAR / 5 Minute ASOS\n\nRoutine / Once Hourly\n\nSpecials\n\n7) Finally, get Data:"
