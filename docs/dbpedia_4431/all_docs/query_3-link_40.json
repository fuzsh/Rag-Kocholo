        "text": "Research and reporting by Cole Rosengren, Max Witynski, Rina Li, E.A. Crunden, Cody Boteler and Katie Pyzyk.\n\nWaste Dive began tracking the effects of China's scrap import policies across all 50 states (and the District of Columbia) during fall 2017 for America Recycles Day. We contacted each state environmental agency and found the problems were only just beginning.\n\nSince then, a host of other market changes have spurred service providers to reset pricing and quality expectations – sometimes drastically. While local governments are struggling to adapt to this new reality, and portrayals of national chaos are an exaggeration, the effects have been noticeable. Waste Dive’s analysis indicates approximately 60 curbside programs have been cancelled, with even more drop-off site closures and material limitations.\n\nAt the same time, solutions are coming. About a dozen curbside programs have been revived in various forms. As of summer 2019, when Waste Dive contacted each state environmental agency once again, many efforts to improve education and infrastructure were underway. Still, the U.S. recycling infrastructure is far from done evolving and further changes should be expected for possibly years to come.\n\nWe’ve been scanning the news regularly to produce this two-year chronology, but we can't spot it all. See information that doesn’t reflect your knowledge or would help expand ours? Send an email to waste.dive.editors@industrydive.com.\n\nSearch our state agency tracker\n\nOR\n\nFilter by most recently updated All\n\nAlaska\n\nScrap policy changes have had \"little effect\" in Alaska as of summer 2019, according to the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. This is likely because recycling programs already accepted a more limited range of materials (e.g. no #3-7 plastics).\n\nEffects\n\nCommunities are informed by Republic Services and others that existing markets for mixed paper, and in some cases mixed plastics, are no longer viable.\n\nJuneau has difficulty moving material ahead of China’s January 2018 implementation date. Sitka, Petersburg and Ketchikan announce plans to drop mixed paper and plastics from recycling programs.\n\nRepublic continues accepting and stockpiling mixed paper, but eventually informs Ketchikan shipments could no longer go out as of March 2018. The city has since announced it will officially stop taking mixed paper.\n\nPetersburg considers halting its recycling program, estimating it could save $3,300 per year.\n\nAnchorage residents can no longer recycle #1 plastic clamshell containers, either through municipal or private service, due to a lack of market options. The city anticipates overall recycling costs will be at least $40,000 higher for the year.\n\nSolutions\n\nRepublic begins charging Sitka up to $150 per ton for loads that have 10% or more contamination, based on a visual inspection. Factoring in transportation costs to Washington state, the city might end up paying as much as $239 per ton. Renewed education efforts are expected.\n\nAfter experiencing the usual financial challenges, Valley Community for Recycling Solutions is doubling down on education. This \"sustain campaign\" is aiming to raise $1 million, including grants.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nKTOO Alaska recyclers find new overseas markets\n\nArkansas\n\nLike other Southeast states, Arkansas was initially seen as less affected by recent market shifts, but that’s changing as contracts come up for renewal and other factors arise locally.\n\nEffects\n\nTexarkana stops accepting all plastics at its drop-off center. Residents can still recycle plastics at a monthly \"Green Texarkana\" event or via curbside subscription service from Waste Management.\n\nMultiple MRFs are stockpiling OCC and paying paper mills to take other fiber grades.\n\nLittle Rock, North Little Rock and Sherwood – working together through the Regional Recycling and Waste Reduction District – sign a new contract with Waste Management that raises rates and eliminates glass starting in April 2019.\n\nTexarkana ends its monthly \"Green Texarkana\" recycling drop-off event due to market conditions.\n\nThe Baxter Recycling Center will no longer accept plastics #3-7 or various types of mixed paper, citing market conditions. (June 2019) The University of Arkansas’ Fayetteville campus learns broker Smurfit Kappa disposed at least four tons of recyclables (mixed plastics and mixed paper) over multiple months.\n\nSolutions\n\nPulaski County plans to offer five regional drop-off options for glass recycling to offset changes in local curbside programs serviced by Waste Management.\n\nAfter weighing various options for more than a year, ahead of an upcoming contract expiration, Fort Smith appears likely to stay the course on its recycling program.\n\nRecycling returns to Columbia County residents for the first time in more than a year, following an equipment upgrade at Abilities Unlimited. The nonprofit’s workers, who previously sorted manually, were overwhelmed by high contamination rates.\n\nLittle Rock officials pass an ordinance allowing the city to charge residents $50 for the return of any recycling cart removed due to habitual contamination. Little Rock and North Little Rock have pulled hundreds of carts throughout the year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut has the usual cost pressures for New England states. As of summer 2019, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection reports the primary side effect is the cost of tipping fees at single-stream MRFs “continues to climb.” Still, the state hasn’t made any changes to its legislatively-defined list of mandatory recyclables, or its universal \"What’s In, What’s Out\" guidelines. DEEP also hasn’t received any requests for disposal waivers, but did acknowledge some communities are sending glass for use as alternative daily cover at landfills.\n\nEffects\n\nThe Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority, which owns a MRF operated by Republic Services, reports sitting on hundreds of fiber bales and sending low-grade plastics (not #5) to the incinerator it manages.\n\nAnnual costs rise in municipalities. Stamford went from earning $95,000 to paying $700,000. New Canaan is paying $100,000 more per a new contract. Wilton, currently losing $300,000 at its transfer station, could end up paying $100,000 more.\n\nThe town of Fairfield goes from earning nearly $64,000 on recycling in 2017 to potentially paying upward of $250,000 in 2018. New Canaan's cost have also increased to $197,000 for the year.\n\nMore municipalities see cost shifts for their recycling programs. Naugatuck, now working with MIRA, won't have to pay to tip recycling but will pay more for trash. Beacon Falls will go from receiving a rebate to paying Oak Ridge Waste and Recycling $65 per ton.\n\nRepublic Services sues MIRA in an effort to exit its MRF operating contract early, citing various issues with contamination rates. MIRA has refused to renegotiate any contract terms ahead of expiration.\n\nSolutions\n\nDEEP launches a universal recycling campaign, called \"What's In, What's Out,\" to standardize sorting guidelines. This was in the works prior to China's import moves, but was touted as a way to help reduce contamination.\n\nThe Closed Loop Fund announces a partnership with DEEP to distribute at least $5 million in recycling infrastructure investment during 2018.\n\nNorwalk's Department of Public Works and City Carting announces a single-stream recycling deal that explicitly excludes plastic bags, plastic film, expanded polystyrene foam and straws. This follows a similar announcement by Stamford, which also sends material to City Carting.\n\nA report from the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities outlining severe cost swings for many local governments sparks concern among officials. Legislative proposals, such as expanding the state’s bottle bill, get renewed attention though ultimately don’t pass.\n\nDelaware\n\nWhile Delaware has been impacted by higher prices, the Delaware Solid Waste Authority reports it has been able to move all materials – though sometimes at a cost. Funding has been covered in part by using a portion of solid waste tip fees for recycling.\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nThe DSWA reports mixed plastics markets have evaporated in recent months, due in large part to the idling of QRS Recycling in Maryland.\n\nThe cost of recycling now exceeds its value in terms of commodity prices for DSWA. DSWA's MRF slows its processing speeds, but no other changes are reported.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) asserts recycling programs are \"alive and well\" in the state due to Delaware's limited reliance on international export markets.\n\nDSWA and DNREC launch the Recycle Right educational campaign. Contamination rates at DSWA’s MRF, operated under contract by Republic Services, have reportedly declined from 18% to 14%.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nD.C.’s Department of Public Works has experienced lower rebates, and increased contamination costs, from the MRFs it contracts with. In response, the agency has begun treating highly-contaminated commercial loads at its transfer stations as refuse and working on residential education throughout the city.\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments Recycling, of which the district is a member, has also established a recycling markets subcommittee to monitor and discuss solutions.\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nD.C. reportedly paid nearly $1.4 million to process its recyclables in 2017, as compared to earning $550,000 in 2011.\n\nThe district's recycling now costs nearly $30 more per ton than disposal.\n\nDPW reports that educational efforts have increased recycling tonnage by 9.5% while decreasing contamination by 8% over the past year.\n\nDPW launches a “Feet on the Street” cart-tagging campaign, working with The Recycling Partnership, to reduce contamination in residential carts on select routes. This campaign builds on the successful pilot from 2018.\n\nGeorgia\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County MRF is feeling market effects and has seen outbound contamination rates more than double.\n\nAugusta considers ending its curbside recycling program as processing costs are expected to increase significantly in 2019. Savannah receives just one bid for a recycling contract and expects to go from earning $15 per ton from Pratt Recycling to paying for the service.\n\nThomasville cuts mixed plastics and glass from its drop-off program.\n\nBulloch County stops accepting all plastics at its drop-off recycling centers. The Candler County Recycling Center, which was sending material to Bulloch, cancels its own plastic recycling program as a result.\n\nIn an effort to strengthen local recycling programs through regionalization, Hall County approves an agreement to take material from neighboring Lumpkin County. Hall will pay half the market rate for cardboard, but will not pay for plastic, metal or paper.\n\nGainesville reaches a new deal to send recyclables to Hall County, versus Athens, and maintain the same rates – but will drop glass. Athens-Clarke County reports paying its highest processing fees ever, with recycling now costing $30 more per ton than landfill disposal.\n\nPeachtree City's recycling center stops accepting plastics, aluminum and other metals.\n\nIndiana\n\nThe state's strong manufacturing base provides in-state markets for recyclables and supports continued investments in recycling infrastructure, according to Indiana's Department of Environmental Management in summer 2019. The Indiana Recycling Market Development Program increased available funding for recycling projects to $2 million and its board is working with a new mission to \"promote innovative projects to make Indiana a leader in recycling and waste reduction.\"\n\nEffects\n\nRepublic Services is nearly doubling rates for Indianapolis residents – the maximum allowed under its contract. Rumpke has raised rates in Brownstown, and Republic Services will no longer accept glass at Greene County recycling centers due to fiber contamination. Johnson County will close all of its \"Recycle Spot\" drop-off sites by the end of July.\n\nBorden Waste-Away Service is the only company to bid on a new contract with St. Joseph County and is asking for a 10-year extension. Wallace Brothers Disposal & Recycling will no longer offer curbside recycling service.\n\nTri-State Resource Recovery reports it has sent some mixed plastics to landfill in recent months due to market constraints.\n\nMartin County has few if any buyers left for its cardboard or paperboard, meaning some or all of it may end up in the area landfill.\n\nRepublic discontinues subscription collection service to an estimated 75 homes in Vigo County, citing financial strains and poor route density.

Bartholomew County's material is also finding domestic buyers such as WestRock and KW Plastics, but multiple local governments in the area are still feeling financial effects.\n\nJohnson County reopens its drop-off recycling center, after closing due to contamination challenges. Tippecanoe County passes an ordinance fining residents for unsanctioned items at drop-off centers, as the sites sees increased demand following the closure of one earlier in the year.\n\nMaryland\n\nThe Department of the Environment initially noted \"significantly higher\" recycling costs for counties and more local outreach around contamination. As of summer 2019, the agency reported “local recycling programs continue, with few changes to materials accepted.” An increased focus on materials not affected by commodity markets, such as organics, has also been noted.\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nCarroll and Anne Arundel counties see large cost swings, and Baltimore's processing fee goes up sharply under a new contract.\n\nWaste Management's Elkridge MRF is making no money on mixed plastics or paper, although viable export markets still exist for cardboard.

The agency has been fielding questions from businesses and municipalities since fall 2017 as market effects sunk in.\n\nDue to a capacity issue in one region of the state, MassDEP issued 70 disposal waivers for unsorted single-stream material through October 2018. Many are short-term waivers that must get re-approved, hence the high number, and material disposed accounts for about 2% of the overall recycling stream at the time.\n\nTo address ongoing challenges, MassDEP has been convening stakeholders, sharing its existing “Recycling IQ Kit\" contamination tool through grants, continuing to disburse grant funding for other recycling programs and launched a new statewide education campaign.\n\nEffects\n\nCasella Waste Systems reports spending more on labor during its Q3 earnings call as market conditions worsen.\n\nE.L.

MassDEP approves multiple short-term waivers as recyclers look for solutions.\n\nABC Disposal threatens to cancel service for multiple municipalities unless they agree to higher rates mid-contract. Plymouth chooses to cancel its contract, leaving residents to seek subscription service as the only option. New Bedford attempts to force the company's hand through an injunction, but loses in court. ABC later countersues New Bedford.\n\nWeCare Environmental abruptly announces plans to shutter its recycling facility by June 2018, leaving municipalities scrambling. The company says market conditions were a key factor. It hopes to relocate into a larger facility soon, but hasn’t by the end of summer 2018.\n\nWorcester is now paying more to recycle with Casella than dispose with Wheelabrator. While the city never actually recouped its recycling costs in the past, those costs are expected to rise further by $300,000 next year. Worcester is pursuing various contamination reduction strategies to reduce costs.\n\nFalmouth stops accepting material at its drop-off site – for the second time in 2018 – though curbside service will continue.\n\nThe Waltham City Council votes to approve $100,000 for rising costs with EZ Disposal.

Casella has found average contamination rates of around 25%.\n\nMashpee will end single-stream recycling at its drop-off center, instead moving back to a source-separated system, with aid from a $6,000 state grant.\n\nMississippi\n\nIn June 2019, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality reported common challenges; high contamination rates and difficulty selling plastics, mixed paper and cardboard due to low commodity prices. According to state recycling coordinator Jennifer Milner, this has led to “significant increases” in residential collection and sorting costs.\n\nThat has compounded pre-existing challenges with Mississippi’s rural nature making MRFs less efficient and in some cases led companies to export material for processing in other states. Still, Milner said, \"most of the state’s local government programs are working to maintain and in some cases grow their programs during this challenging time with only a few programs scaling back at this point.\"\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nJackson's Department of Public Works considered canceling curbside service. The city currently spends an estimated $1.1 million per year on recycling with Waste Management and said it could no longer cover the cost.\n\nOcean Springs and Gulfport agree to drop glass from their recycling programs at the request of Waste Pro.\n\nThe Jackson City Council unanimously votes to cancel curbside recycling service effective Sept. 1. Local officials have pledged to find alternative solutions and consider resuming service in the future. Meanwhile, Ridgeland reports its program is running strong.\n\nNevada\n\nIn November 2017, officials from the state's Department of Environmental Protection said China’s impending scrap import ban was “greatly affecting markets” since most recyclables from Nevada are sent to China through ports in Oakland or Los Angeles. Since then, news has been relatively quiet.\n\nRecycling for the state’s major population centers is handled under long-term franchise agreements with Waste Management and Republic Services, meaning less of the usual volatility around contract negotiations and MRF pricing. As of June 2019, the DEP reported contamination remains a “significant problem” for multiple communities serviced by Waste Management. Plastic film and mixed rigids have been dropped in some cases. Following the completion of a new solid waste management plan, the agency plans to work on market development and an education campaign.\n\nEffects and Solutions\n\nThe Salvation Army stopped collecting recyclables from local businesses as of Oct. 2017 due to cost issues. Waste Management was preparing to take over those contracts, largely to collect cardboard.\n\nThe Nevada Independent reports that Waste Management and Republic are experiencing the usual effects. Reno, serviced by Waste Management, has reduced its contamination rate to 25% and is pushing further. Customers in certain counties are now receiving fines for improper recycling.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey is among a small list of states with mandatory recycling requirements, meaning larger changes to curbside programs are less likely and more complicated from a regulatory standpoint. Some municipalities have switched back to dual-stream systems, but that is dependent on regional infrastructure and local factors.\n\nThe Association of New Jersey Recyclers reported MRF operators were feeling many of the same national effects in the spring of 2018. The association confirmed those conditions have persisted as of summer 2019, with recycling costs nearing that of disposal in some cases. With many contracts due for renewal in 2020, additional price increases can be expected.\n\nEffects\n\nGiordano Co. asks municipalities to keep plastic bags and shredded paper out of the recycling stream. The company says it may drop mixed plastics, but not until the end of the year.\n\nMaplewood starts including plastics #3-7, or any material in plastic bags, among its list of prohibited items.\n\nAtlantic Coast Recycling in Passaic reports 10-25% of the material it takes in is now being landfilled due to contamination and tighter quality standards.

Standardized education lists, a new market development council, business loans and additional research are among many ideas discussed.\n\nHoboken switches to dual-stream recycling collection, involving paper collection on a separate night, which it claims could save the city $200,000 per year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew Mexico was among the early wave of states to feel effects in 2017, but has seen balance more recently. The Environment Department reports some smaller communities have seen their material displaced from the state’s two largest MRFs due to an operational backlog. This has led some to change their collection systems, drop materials from their programs or seek new markets. Despite these shifts, according to the agency’s Joan Snider in summer 2019, “to date we haven’t seen large changes in solid waste fees.”\n\nThe New Mexico Recycling Coalition is partnering with the state and others to help emphasize material quality through consistent messaging. Coalition director Sarah Pierpont agreed “the rural hubs that have single-stream are struggling” and said processing costs have doubled in some cases.\n\nEffects\n\nSole area processor Friedman Recycling asks multiple cities, including Albuquerque, El Paso and Santa Fe, to renegotiate contract terms at its local MRFs.\n\nSanta Fe approves a contract adjustment with Friedman that will be covered by cash reserves. This could increase costs by $540,000 to $720,000.\n\nThe South Central Solid Waste Authority approves a rate increase, which is estimated to generate an additional $40,000 per month for Friedman.\n\nRecycling service in the small village of Bosque Farms is suspended. Reporting initially indicates Silver City has dropped all materials except cardboard. It’s later reported service will remain the same after a new processor is found.\n\nLincoln County is no longer accepting mixed paper or paperboard at drop-off sites.\n\nThe Greentree Solid Waste Authority will stop accepting mixed paper and paperboard for drop-off.\n\nSilver City will end its curbside recycling program, and this time expects the decision to be permanent for the near future, as costs with Friedman Recycling are set to rise again.\n\nThe Taos Recycling Center will no longer take glass or plastic as of September. An additional $100,000 in reserve funding will be used to keep the center open for a six-month trial period.\n\nSolutions\n\nLas Cruces begins inspecting carts for contamination using The Recycling Partnership's positive feedback tag method, rather than a fee. Los Alamos County is focusing on education, in an effort to reduce its 17% contamination rate and stave off a potential rate increase from Friedman.\n\nAlbuquerque is launching a “Recycle Right ABQ” education program that will provide residents with tips on what shouldn't be recycled and share success stories.\n\nLas Cruces has reportedly seen a 15-20% increase in quality following its cart inspection and tagging program. Rising processing costs with Friedman Recycling have led local governments that work with the company to start collaborating on new ideas.\n\nLas Cruces and other local governments officially launch their efforts to improve material quality in the Rio Grande Recycling Corridor with a $125,000 grant focused on education. Working with the National Recycling Coalition and New Mexico Recycling Coalition, local officials also host a regional market development workshop.\n\nNew York\n\nThe Department of Environmental Conservation reported few known effects in the fall of 2017, but that began to change in 2018 and the agency later recognized that due to market volatility \"some operations may find it challenging to find suitable outlets for some material.\"\n\nBy summer 2019, the DEC reported engagement on multiple fronts to address a trend of expensive shifts for local recycling programs. The agency pointed to a new education campaign and upcoming plastic bag ban as ways to improve contamination rates, along with ongoing grant support to municipalities.\n\nEffects\n\nSt. Lawrence County had a $127,000 budget shortfall recently due to higher recycling costs.\n\nFort Edward cancels curbside service, revealing it has been disposing of residents' material after Waste Management closed a local drop-off site in 2017.

Processing costs have more than doubled.\n\nPrivate haulers in New York City report difficulties moving material. Sims Municipal Recycling, the city’s residential MRF operator, can move material but is losing money on mixed paper.\n\nRecycling costs for communities sending material to the Beacon ReCommunity MRF, now owned by Republic, are on the rise.\n\nGreen Stream Recycling, Brookhaven's MRF operator, announces plans to fold. This site had been experiencing challenges with moving material, to the point that waterlogged fiber bales had to be composted in one case. The company may not be able to pay the town an estimated $1.7 million owed.\n\nOrange County begins charging $104 per ton to tip recyclables at its transfer station, due to higher rates from Waste Connections. The Suffolk County executive is pushing for a county-wide policy amid rising costs locally. Multiple towns in Warren County are also seeing rate increases.\n\nAmherst is no longer accepting mixed plastics or glass in curbside collection, per Modern Disposal's request. Lansing also drops mixed plastics.

Free drop-off recycling will end at five Washington County transfer stations owned by Earth Waste and Metal.\n\nSolutions\n\nThe Ulster County Resource Recovery Agency announces it will stop accepting single-stream material as of Jan. 2019, and has sharply increased tip fees. The town of Ulster will take a similar step in Aug. 2018.\n\nRensselaer will raise rates by 27% to cover higher costs at Waste Connections’ County Waste MRF. Winter Bros. will honor its current contract with Oyster Bay in which the town earns $25 per ton of recycling, after initially trying to renegotiate for a $65 per ton charge, until it expires at the end of the year.\n\nGov.

The company will continue offering curbside service.\n\nFargo proposes a $65,000 increase in its recycling budget for the upcoming budget, including a rate increase for curbside service that began in 2017. Contamination has reportedly been an issue at drop-off sites.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon was one of the first states to feel the full brunt of China's effects in 2017, due to its “inexpensive and easy access” to container back hauls to China, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. It remained in the headlines for months as a result and many MRF operators were forced to request disposal permission. DEQ has been engaged from the start in terms of ongoing stakeholder meetings and transparency.\n\nAccording to the agency's latest figures, (Aug. 29, 2019) there have been 26 disposal concurrences granted since Sept. 2017. This totaled 16,394 tons between Sept. 1, 2017 and July 31, 2019 – about 0.4% of statewide recycling activity during that time.\n\nIn June 2019, the DEQ reported that where programs made changes it was common to see mixed plastics get cut. Collection and processing fees have also increased throughout the state. The DEQ continues to engage with recycling stakeholders with monthly meetings.\n\nEffects\n\nNumerous MRFs are stockpiling material, struggling to meet new quality standards and trying to find a financial solution for the drastic market change.

Dual-stream or source-separated programs have experienced fewer challenges, but all areas of the states have felt financial effects. A wave of attempted contract renegotiations for single-stream programs has been particularly striking, with glass getting cut in many cases.\n\n“We've seen downturns in the marketplace before and we recovered from them,” said DEP’s Lawrence Holley. “Most importantly, we need to think about how we're going to begin to collect materials in a manner that does not create a less recyclable commodity.”\n\nEffects\n\nCrawford County suspends its drop-off program, after facing a potential $200 penalty from Waste Management for each contaminated load.\n\nWaste Management stops accepting paper, cardboard and glass at an Erie County drop-off site.\n\nCost increases at Penn Waste will in turn affect customers serviced by the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority (LCSWMA).\n\nPenn Waste announces a new list of accepted materials, which does not include mixed paper or multiple mixed plastics.

Mascaro & Sons begins accepting flexible packaging in one curbside program, the first of what could be a broader push to remove the potential contaminant for value. Shell Chemicals gives Beaver County a $225,000 grant to help expand hours and accessibility at a local drop-off center. The funding stems from Shell’s construction of a major petrochemical plant in the area.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island’s situation is unique, with material going to one main MRF operated by the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC) – a quasi-state agency. The agency didn’t report notable effects in 2017, but confirmed it was “feeling the financial strain” in summer 2019. Still, RIRRC continues to find markets for its materials, and hasn’t turned a profit since FY 15 anyway, so has no plans to change course.\n\nRIRRC also revamped its municipal grant program to expand access in June 2018, is focused on improving commercial recycling quality and has put ongoing resources into a statewide education campaign around contamination. Since its launch in 2017, the “Let’s recycle RIght!” campaign resulted in an 18% reduction in rejected tonnage at the MRF.\n\nEffects\n\nThe RIRRC MRF reports struggling to find markets for mixed paper and paying to move it.\n\nIn a status update, RIRRC reports it is no longer moving any material to China and expects mixed paper costs to result in an operating loss at the state's MRF for the current fiscal year.\n\nPawtucket's Department of Public Works reports the city has been charged $61,000 over the past nine months for rejected loads at the RIRRC MRF.
