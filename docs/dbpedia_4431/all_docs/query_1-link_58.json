        "text": "Bio\n\nKim McConaha, a Centerville, Ind., native with worldwide volleyball experience, was appointed head volleyball coach at Indiana University East on March 22, 2019.\n\nMcConaha came to IU East as the volleyball assistant coach in 2017 and had served as the program's interim head coach since September 2018. She contributed to IU East winning two River States Conference East Division titles and the 2017 conference tournament championship.\n\nVIDEO: Meet IU East volleyball coach Kim McConaha\n\n\"The IU East community is all about creating opportunities and developing students for success after their time with us,\" McConaha said. \"I am privileged to work with such a dedicated community, and I am passionate about growing the volleyball program at IU East.”\n\nMcConaha turned the challenging circumstances in the pandemic-affected 2020-21 season into an opportunity for success. The Red Wolves won all of their fall regular season matches and reached the River States Conference Championship title match for the first time in four years. IU East qualified for the NAIA Women's Volleyball National Championship for the seventh time in program history.\n\nMcConaha played at Purdue University from 2001 through 2004, where she was a first-team All-Big Ten and honorable mention All-Mideast Region honoree. She then embarked on a professional career that included stints in France, Spain, Switzerland, Puerto Rico and Indonesia between 2005 and 2010. She also played professionally in Tunisia in 2015-16.\n\nMcConaha coached the men's and women's volleyball teams at American University of Kuwait between 2011 and 2015. She also served as an assistant coach at Earlham College in 2011 and at UC Irvine during the 2016 season. She has coached at camps in Alaska, Oregon, Texas, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, including annual appearances at Purdue's summer camp.\n\nMcConaha is married to Bruno Amorim Da Silva, a professional volleyball player from Brazil who competes on the indoor and beach circuits. The couple's daughter, Athena, was born in 2013.\n\nMcConaha earned her bachelor's degree in business management from Purdue's Krannert School of Management in 2005. She recently completed her master's degree in coaching and athletic administration from Concordia University Irvine (Calif.).\n\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT KIM McCONAHA\n\n\"Kim is a natural fit. Kim has her roots in the area, but possesses volleyball experience at the highest level. The experience she had with the team at IU East the past two seasons will make this a smooth transition. I see her being successful as she continues to build on the IU East volleyball program's tremendous history.\" - Joe Griffin, Director of Athletics, Indiana University East\n\n\"I am so excited for Kim. When our staff arrived at Purdue, Kim was the leader of a team that was determined to create something very special. Possibly the toughest competitor I have coached at Purdue, Kim displays a no-fear mentality. A great communicator and passionate teacher, the IU East players will always know the plan, the purpose and the expectations. Very few coaches at any level have the energy and drive of Kim McConaha. I was very fortunate she was entering her junior year when I took over at Purdue, and IU East is just as fortunate to have her as its new coach. Kim’s effort as a coach is relentless. She is churning volleyball thoughts 24 hours a day. I look forward to watching the development of her team.\" - Dave Shondell, Women's Volleyball Head Coach, Purdue University\n\n\"Kim is a world-class person and teacher with endless energy, passion and character. Over the past 35 years, I have had the opportunity to observe many young coaches, teachers and athletes. In those years, I have gradually formed a personal composite of the characteristics of the consummate leader, both academically and athletically. Compared to this composite, Kim rates at or near the top on all categories. Congrats to Kim and IU East. For some people success is probable, for Ms. McConaha it is inescapable.\" - Mike Lingenfelter, Munciana Volleyball Club Co-Club Director and three-time IHSAA state champion coach\n\n\"I’m so excited for Kim and Indiana University East. Kim is an outstanding person and I believe one of the top emerging coaches in the country. From the time I recruited Kim to Purdue, I believed she would do great things. She has a wonderful family and brings a wealth of experience as a player and coach to IU East. Just as Kim was a difference maker on the court as a player, I believe she will be the same difference maker on the bench as a head coach. Congratulations on an outstanding hire, and I look forward to following IU East in the coming seasons.\" - Jeff Hulsmeyer, Women's Volleyball Associate Head Coach, Florida State University\n\nCOACH McCONAHA YEAR-BY-YEAR RECORD"
