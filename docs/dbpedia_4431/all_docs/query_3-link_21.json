        "text": "Reporter Date Location Color Rachel Wall Sep 22, 2023 Collierville, TN Tan/Gold Saw a very large cat-like animal hunting on the grassy edge of a lake in my backyard. The deer were “blowing” at him to try to get him to leave. I waved my arms and he strolled away toward a neighbors home. The long tail was especially noteworthy for me. Definitely not a bobcat. My guess is young cougar. Debbra McFarland Sep 21, 2023 Dover, TN Dark On front porch at 108 Cambridge Court apartment 22 Dover Tennessee Cheri Hardy Sep 8, 2023 Between Kenton and Sharon, TN Brownish I was on a ladder behind my house and happened to turn snd looked down the road beside my house and saw a large animal walk across the road from one field to the next. It walked like a lion walked. I was so surprised i kept looking cause i knew it was not a dog by the way it walked but too big to be a cat. I ask around if there was big cats in this area but no one knew. When i saw this article i knew what i had seen!! Patricia Duncan Sep 4, 2023 Crossville, TN Yellow with an orange tint I was in the kitchen, shortly before 8am, Labor Day 2023, and movement caught my eye, outside on the driveway. I looked and at first I thought it might be a large house cat or the red fox we see frequently, but I when I saw the side view, I immediately knew it was a young cougar, maybe the size of a cattle dog. I reached for the binoculars, as it was walking away from me, and the tail was a cougar’s tail, along with the large paws and smaller ears. I watched it until it disappeared into the trees and the hill in the driveway. It was definitely what I have always id’d as a panther. Jamie Chandler Sep 2, 2023 Brownsville, TN Gray/tan Saw a large cat in our back yard about 150 yards from the house at about 6:30 am. It had a long tail that was really dark and it was about the size of our large dog. It went towards a group of trees and I never saw it come back out. Lynn schumann Aug 29, 2023 Germantown , TN Tan Doing work about a month or so ago at st. George school and saw it. I have pics and videos Cynthia Wilson Aug 9, 2023 Medina, TN Light beige Heard dogs persistently barking out back of my house checked it out multiple times. Finally, saw a light beige creature stand up in the tall grass and sprinted so fast across my yard it was hard to see it clearly. It must have been heavy cause I could feel it. Ashley Aug 8, 2023 Troy, TN Tan My boyfriend left the house one morning several days ago. When he returned he called for me to come outside and look at something. When I got to where he was I looked at a MASSIVE feline paw print maybe the size of my boyfriend's hand if not bigger. He took several pictures to see what we could find on the Internet. We assumed the large feline was possibly just passing through up until last night. Last night my boyfriend went outside around 11:30 pm for something. He soon returned into the house wide eyed and a little shaky telling me he had a bad feeling that something was watching him, which isn't like him, he continued to tell me when he turned around he saw very deep large wide set pair of eyes glowing at him. He told me the \"cougar\" was not just passing through, and that the cougar is tan with a long tail and is extremely massive in size. He said the \"cougar\" was crouching low in the tree bank below the hill. We live way out in the country going towards Reelfoot Lake, a lot of wildlife in our area. Doug Aug 5, 2023 Martin, TN Brown Crossed on Hawks Road about 75 to 100 ft. in front of me. Clear visual & easy to see that it was a cougar. Sherry Baldwin Jul 11, 2023 Clarksville , TN Tan I live just on the outside of Clarksville city limits. He was just slowly walking along the edge of the woods across the street from our house. This is several hundred yards away from me and my surrounding neighbors. I watch for it every day but unfortunately haven't been able to see it again or get a picture for proof. Nikki Teague Jul 7, 2023 Laurel Bloomery, TN Dark Caught on camera on front lawn Barbara Green Jun 3, 2023 Piney Flats, TN Dark brown Large cat 100 lbs to 120 lbs. Really long tail. Ernest Thompson May 27, 2023 Wildersville, TN Gold/tan 5:30pm around 75-80degrees, it comes out of thick wooded area on this 225 acre farm 100 yards from me.my old lady brings my monocular. 3-4 minutes we looked at each other ,it turned back into woods. Deer tracks where down in that area.the other time was a glimpse not even enough to tell what it was. Michele Gittings May 25, 2023 Stewart, TN Medium brown Adolescent mountain lion crossed in front of our car & headed down to the creek. It wasn't running but scampering. Approx 30 lb plus range & a very clear view. Cameron Cox May 20, 2023 Spring Hill, TN Grayish yellow/beige At 10:55pm, I decided to take my trash onto the back patio, with a screen door. My dog had been outside for his chores and frantically came inside 15 minutes before the event, so I was weary on the porch. My eyes adjusted, to see a large feline glaring in at me through the screen in the dark. I screamed and dropped the trash, causing a loud thunk and my dog to start barking. The cat ran off, but here’s the thing: the screen on my door starts 3 feet off the ground, and this feline was easily towering over that. As it ran off, a bit of me was intrigued and watched it charge towards an old large treehouse (giant red oak) and leap over 5 stairs. It had a long back, huge paws, and a long tail. Definitely not a bobcat. Way too big for a maine coon. And definitely not a domestic cat. The only other time I’ve seen a face like that was at the grassmere zoo in Nashville, where the cougar glared down at me. I’ve seen that face once before in a zoo, plexiglass and an huge waterfall to create distance and still shuddered. Felt even scarier to see the exact same face 6-7 feet away, silently waiting for me or my dog to come back outside. Tiffany Summers May 15, 2023 Newport , TN Brown I was driving at night on the road towards my home where deer normally hang out and I saw something brown so I thought it was a deer and I always stop and try to take pictures of them. They aren’t dangerous they normally stand still or run off. This road has no streetlights or anything and it’s completely dark. I kept sitting there waiting to get a clear image and the animal kept moving towards me. I saw a glare off of my camera when I tried to take a picture and the flash shined off of the animal’s eyes and when that happened I saw what the animal was. It was a mountain lion. I was so scared I jumped in my car without even trying to get a good picture. If that glare hadn’t have happened I would have got attacked. There is a steam nearby and I think it was passing through. The only time I saw it: Kim Small May 9, 2023 Franklin, TN Dark tan with darker tail Riding bike on Boxley Valley road in Franklin, had stopped for water break and it was crossing field between houses. It stopped when I saw it because I mentioned to my husband and he confirmed it wasn’t a fox. Too big for that. He continued walking and eventually out of sight. This is a rural area with livestock, chickens, etc. Many farms. Good size animal. ANDRIA STRICKLAND May 2, 2023 Clarksville, TN tan? Far away, a \"huge cat with a long tail\" walked out into a large grassy field that i was walking around and picking up trash. It was huge with a very long tail.. I took several pictures, but it was far away. They are blurry. But, i have several. Its not a bobcat or a house /domestic cat.

At first glance it registered dog but it's tail was to big and long for a dog. I then thought maybe it was a mountain lion. I turned around to verify the sighting but when I got back to the gated entrance there was no animal to be seen. Hanks Field, Bartlett Rd, Memphis, TN 38134 Scott Edward Stiles Jan 25, 2023 Eads, TN tan November 2022 - Driving on Canadaville loop off of Hwy 196 at dusk, I saw something crossing the road and I slowed down. At first I thought it was a large dog, then it crouched down like only a cat can do in the middle of the road as it was crossing. At that point, I knew it was not a dog and it was way too large to be a domesticated cat. Becca Woodward Jan 24, 2023 Leoma, TN Tan We live on 21 acres of creek from ridges and caves. It was during the day. It walked towards us then sat on the other side of the creek and watched us before continuing up the ridge and out of site. It was amazing, massive and had a very long tail.

Seemed taller, and could tell is paws were darker, likely muddy. It was in a tree line off the highway, and there was a field behind the trees, and she could see more trees in the distance behind that field.\n\nReporter Date Location Color Mylene Dec 28, 2022 Rockford , TN Tan and black Looking out the window and saw the mountain lion in the tall grass about a hundred yards away.

Amanda Nov 19, 2022 Columbia , TN Tan I live on a backroad surrounded by woods everywhere. I was in my car and I just turned on my road, and I seen this big tan cat with a very long tail run across the road. I slowed down to try and get a picture but it was too dark. I wish I had a dash cam. I've seen plenty of Bobcats and coyotes out here so I know 100% it wasn't one of those.

I saw something tan colored, thinking it was a deer. As I got closer I could tell it was a cougar. As it ran away the head turned to look at me. I saw the white face and black nose. The cougar continued to run though the soybeans. I measured the area and determined the height of the cougar at 30 inches. It was muscular and beautiful. I had about 15 seconds of viewing. There was a trail camera near, sadly no picture. Vicki Oct 23, 2022 Gatlinburg , TN tan saw a cougar heading away from Park Headquarters Road at 1AM on 10/21.

White on nose Spotted on night camera by community member a few days before I walked out my front door around dusk and saw it at the edge of the field. (About 40 yards away) It appeared to be trying to get prey out of large brush pile. It was very large. Too big for a bobcat. I would guess about 180-200 lbs. When he looked up at me I froze and screamed. It ran through the field into the brush at the edge of the farm. We have also found prints along side deer tracks in our garden this past summer. Danielle Sep 30, 2022 Decherd, TN Tan Took our dog outside at 10:30 pm and the mountain lion ran through our backyard Rosann Walters Sep 8, 2022 Hollow Rock, TN Light tan I was heading to Jackson for surgery in November of 2016 about 4 a.m. about a half mile from my home on a side road when at a crossroads I saw a large cat (really large) loping across a yard and crossing right in front of my car.

July 2022 Jesse Johnson Jun 21, 2022 Atoka , TN Golden We live at the edge of town and have frequently had turkey,deer, even the occasional bobcat in our yard. I pulled out the driveway onto the main road and came over the next hill and saw a big cat in the road, I thought it was a big bobcat till it turned sideways and the tail was nearly as long as it’s body with a hook upwards at the end, it was very sleek and crouched low to the ground when it darted back into the woods. Based on how wide our paved road is the Length of its body and tail was probably only around 4-5 ft. It didn’t appear to be more than 70lbs and couldn’t have been a full grown male. Maybe a female or juvenile? I didn’t say anything to anyone except the others in our house to be careful about it. I then saw a Facebook post on our community stating other sightings and shared mine. That’s where I found this page. Brian Jun 18, 2022 Smyrna, TN Yellowish orange Roaming a field off Weekley Ln Yep Jun 10, 2022 Ramer, TN Light brown Was coyote hunting at night with thermal scope.

Before I went outside I flipped on our outside lights that consist of over 300 ft. of string lights and we have a light pole we pay for.

We were headed out on a family vacation, and the kids hadn’t fallen asleep yet. As we drove through the country, we were seeing a significant deer population. There were groups of 2-5 deer grazing along the side of the road, every half mile or so. In the midst of this population, an animal darted across the road in front of our car.

Estimate it was about 120-150 lbs based on its size but was somewhat shocked seeing it because I didn’t realize they were around.

Appeared to be feline in appearance. Too big and too plain colored to be a bobcat. Jill F. Nov 3, 2021 Collierville, TN dark I was driving after dark around 7:20 p.m. on Holmes Road just about 150 yards or so east of Forest Hill Irene Road. There are a lot of deer and other wildlife in this area. Was traveling about 45 miles per hour and saw a very sleek large cat cross the road in front of me and go down into the ravine beside the road. It had a very long tail - it was crouching low to the ground like it was trying not to be seen (I've never seen Bobcats do that, and have seen Bobcats several times before). It seemed like a very dark colored cat; but maybe was just seeing more of its silhouette. I had my headlights on bright; but the light didn't ever reach it well enough to see detail other than the silhouette. It was not like a Bobcat at all and was at least the size of our 45 pound dog, probably a bit bigger. It was just so sleek and walked so smoothly and quickly without running across the road, like it was gliding across the road. I've seen a lot of wildlife in my 57 years, foxes, deer, ground hogs, beavers, skunks, even black bears in east TN - I've never personally witnessed an animal that moved like this other than regular house cats; but this was far too big to be a domestic cat. The tail was quite prominent. Interesting! Kim Ewing Oct 28, 2021 Cordova, TN Light/Tan One year ago now, during the fall of 2020, at dusk, I had just turned off of Walnut Grove Rd and was traveling north bound on Houston Levee Road. At the crest of the first uphill grade (at Holly Grove Rd) I clearly saw a large tan cougar run across Houston Levee Road from the wooded west side to the wooded east side of the road and disappear into the wooded area. There is no doubt that it was a large/full grown mountain lion/cougar. Also, several times over about 6 months prior to this sighting, I had noticed extra large paw prints through our bank property. I wear a size 5 woman’s shoe and these paw prints were near the size of my shoe print. A few times I mentioned these paw prints to my husband. He agreed that these were huge paw prints. I have not noticed any of these same paw prints nor sightings over this past year. Jessy Strohmeyer Oct 4, 2021 Along I-64 in Polk County, TN Tawny In July of 2010, I was driving west on I-64 near the sight of the then-recent second I-64 rock slide when I saw a cougar climbing the rocks off the right side of the interstate. It was about halfway up the steep rock face, carefully picking its way upward. I questioned what I was seeing for a moment, as I'd always read and been told that cougars no longer inhabited the eastern part of the US. But I could clearly make out the distinctive black-tipped blunt tail. I've loved and studied cats, large and small, my entire life. There was zero confusing this animal with a bobcat or domestic cat. Michael lewing Sep 15, 2021 Memphis , TN Cream/whitish color Was at work removing some debris from behind a woman's house in a slightly wooded area in a big neighborhood and across the drainage ditch something big came out. My coworker thought it was a dog but after it came into sight it was a big cat weighing at least 75 lbs. Very muscular in the front legs. It stayed there and watched us from about 30 yards away for a good 35 minutes. Nancy Mullins Sep 6, 2021 Jelico, TN Tan with black tip on tail Not sure if this is something that needs to be reported but I am traveling back to Ohio from our camping trip to the Smoky Mountains and just now at mile marker 154 on 75 north there was a young cougar right on the other side of the guardrail in a cleared area. It looked to be young. It was three times the size of a house cat. It was tan in color and had a black tip on its long tail. Jennifer Parker Sep 5, 2021 Memphis, TN Light brown, dirty possibly Spotting while driving to work. I had just crossed over Germantown Parkway heading north, when I spotted it on the right side of the road. It was hard to tell what it was until I got right up next to it and it raised its head. It was a huge cat. It wasn’t far from the biking trails that are along the wolf river.

Bronco Brown Jul 17, 2021 Sparta, TN Tan Sitting in my recliner looking out the window saw what I thought was a fox about 100 yards away. I got my binoculars and it was a mountain lion.

I drove past it in the 2nd row of the corn field. It just sat there and watched me. Elijah and Christian shannon Jun 23, 2021 Sharon, TN Tan My boys seen a mountain lion out in the woods. It was day time and he was sleeping on a dead log. My boys were terrified. The cat seen them I guess they woke him up! They ran home and told me they seen a lion. I looked it up and showed the images they said it was in fact a couger! From the description he was huge! Cathy Lemons Jun 14, 2021 Haywood County, TN light tan with white underside seen very near my home in the road .. came out of a corn field just minutes behind a doe deer. This is a daily afternoon crossing for deer. I have noticed some doe's very pregnant the past few weeks. The cat saw me .. looked .. and slowly walked back into the corn field.

Robert G May 30, 2021 Turtletown/Cherokee Nat Forest , TN Tawny brown Deep in Cherokee Nat Forest, up on the Turtletown Adit spur off of MacFarlane Rd 23. Towards dusk, rounded a bend on the narrow shelf road, on left side for about 7 solid seconds watched it trot along then dart into scrub, then up a vertical rock wall like only a cat can do, approx 50 to 80lbs, solid tawny brown short coat, distinct black tip of the long tail, absolutely without question a cougar. Saw one in the wild in the \"Bob\" Nat Wilderness in 2017 that was bigger, but unquestionably same species seen here today. Chuck bery May 26, 2021 Huron, TN Fawn On my farm 150 acres . 200 yards from house in back yard Zach Riggs May 24, 2021 Trenton , TN Tan orange I heard strange sound out back by the edge of the shed in back yard it was a cross between a cat purr and chatter, it was hunting something under shed , i had full view of it and i backed away and come inside . Its was beautiful Melissa Vance May 23, 2021 Memphis Wolf River Bottoms, TN Tawny brown As I rounded a turn on the trail, there was a large cat with a long tail that was walking on the trail about 30 feet in front of me. The cat heard me, stopped, and turned to look at me. After several seconds he jumped off the trail and ran into the woods. Julie Elliott May 22, 2021 Andy Harris Road, Blount County, TN Tan While riding bikes, I saw a cougar down a hill. Definitely bigger than a bobcat. Tall, standing there looking at me with just its front two legs out in the open and it’s back end still in the grass along the woods. He turned and backed into the woods. He had rounded ears and a round face and strong, thick front legs. Robert Landry May 13, 2021 Jasper, TN About a year ago, a large cat crossed Timber Ridge Road as I was going down from Jasper Highlands at dusk. It was too big to be a bobcat and I thought at first it was a coyote because it was about that size until it turned sideways and walked to the other side. I saw its head and it had the classic silhouette of a cat without a doubt. McKenna May 10, 2021 Eads, TN grey While driving home one afternoon of 2018, I watched a mountain lion cross the road from my family's property into an adjacent cornfield. Iconic grey color, white underbelly and long tail. Jared Austin Jordan Apr 25, 2021 McKenzie , TN Tan Around 8:00 PM April 24 2021, I was driving through McKenzie and right past the highschool I encountered a large feline crossing the road in front of me. It sauntered across the road so I was able to see it’s body completely. I instinctively slammed on the breaks and luckily was able to stop in time. Once it reached the grass on the opposite side of the road it stopped, looked towards my car, and just walked off. Thankfully due to the road markings I was about to estimate it’s size to be 7-7.5 feet long. What stood out to me was it’s tail and how muscular it was. If I had hit it with my car I’m sure it would’ve totaled my vehicle. I’ve seen just about every wild creature we have native to west Tennessee and this is the first time I’ve seen one of these. I’ve heard rumors about tracks and sightings but those are usually made regarding the black panthers which are supposedly extinct. This one was most definitely a cougar. Penelope Fortenberry Apr 12, 2021 Humboldt, TN tan with long tail in valley along the edge of field the animal was running we spotted this on 22 five miles south of Lexington on the east side of the road Dante Harlan Mar 6, 2021 Collierville , TN Fawn color same as a dear Saw 2 cougars walking along beaver creek in the wooded area. I 1st thought they were deer because I see a lot of deer in the area but they had very long tails and were big so I could not believe what I saw until I googled descriptions and saw pics. The color, tail and size matched. There were about 50 yds away and continued moving further in the woods and disappeared. Taylor & Cara Augustat Feb 20, 2021 Crossville, TN Fawn/tan We were driving from Crossville towards Gatlinburg after visiting with a friend, and I don’t believe we even made it to Crab Orchard on I-40E when we saw it. My wife and I spotted a large animal on the side of the highway walking alongside it. It definitely was not a deer or bear, as it had large paws and a long tail - like a cat. It was much larger than a typical bobcat, looked very much like other cougars we’ve seen in zoos and on screen/photos.\n\nReporter Date Location Color ken stanaford Dec 16, 2012 campbell and claiborne county TN, TN tawny, rust, gray,white, black outline. Hello friends, I have been reading the many sighting reports and thought I might add mine. I have been an avid outdoorsman for over 40 years. I have been blessed to have been one of the first people in this area to have made a report of a black bear sighting that was proven to be true some 30 plus years ago. I am proud of this for several reasons. The first of which being that I was confident enough to have reported the bear. Second that even being told that I must have been mistaken, I never changed my story. Third,I had the unique chance to be present when the bear was brought by my location and to report it's death on the radio after it had been struck by a car on I75 just a few miles from where I had reported seeing it. I wish someone had taken my report serious. I was told that bears were no longer in our area or anywhere in TN outside the smokies. Now we have bears everywhere even in town. Well here we go again. I have had the unique opportunity to see two cougars in the wild here in TN. They are rusty or tawny in color with white or lighter colors on their belly, and they seem to have a dark outline around their head and tail. I don't know where they came from or how many there are, but a close friend has saw a couple as well and was present for one of my lucky sightings. together we have had three different cat sightings in this general area and in less than 4 years. We both have over 40 years experience predator calling and other types of hunting and outdoor activity. I'm convinced these sightings were of cougars, no mistaken idents here. We don't want publicity for ourselves or the cats. We would love to see them taken seriously and protected if needed to insure their future here in TN. We have lost so much of our wild areas and the animals that were once living here in east and all of TN. Our elk are coming back and the black bear is back and doing great. I hope people in power will realize the importance of these creatures to a healthy eco system, and educate the public so as to protect all parties involved. These animals have plenty to eat in the wild, and if left alone will stay clear of us in most cases. Much more needs to be known about this animal in order to protect it's comeback. People are not all ignorant, and we do actually know what we are seeing on occasion. They are here in small numbers, so let us stop the arguments and deal with the reality of them before they start being proven by dead cats and terrified people. Thanks for your site and ears. marie Dec 13, 2012 morrison, TN light tan; tawny Baby or young cougar crossing road. Rural area right by our house. Ryan Jones Nov 24, 2012 Shelby county, tn, TN Brown and tan Saw cougar in field about 50yd away watched him walk across for about 10 min and then down tree line. Andy Hodek Nov 21, 2012 Cordova, TN Light brown 11/12/12 Riding the Wolf River trails (White trail) in Shelby Farms a cougar, (not a bobcat, because I saw one of those two weeks ago on the same trail), crossed the trail 30 yds in front of me.

Tim Dearstone Nov 20, 2012 Greeneville, TN Camel Tan Cougar was spotted at the Ottway Church, then about 45 minutes later the Cougar was seen crossing the Ottway road just west of Ottway School. These two sightings occured with 1/4 mile of each other by two different people. Anonymous Nov 18, 2012 Columbia, TN Tan I was driving along Campbellsville Pike in Columbia, TN around 7 p.m. on Friday November 16, 2012, when a large tan cat with a long bushy tail ran across the road. I thought it could have been a bobcat until I looked up pictures on the internet and am pretty sure I saw a cougar. The tail and size gave it away. Zeb Jones Nov 13, 2012 Big Rock, TN Tan or golden brown It was just after dusk, about 5:30pm. I was diving on highway 120, and had only gotten about 100yds from my home when a large buck crossed the road. It was running but their was just enough light for me and my kids to stop and watch. Then as I began to proceed, a large animal that appeared to be chasing the buck ran in front of my car. I nearly hit it, it couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 feet from the front end of my car but I could still see its back and distinct tail. I questioned what I just seen but both of my children (without any prompt) exclaimed \"that was a mountain lion\" . In fact my daughter who is twelve even commented on what a long tail it had. I also noted the tail again as it ran up the hill and it was siloueted by the setting sun. I have watched enough nature shows and seen enough cougars at the zoo to know that this was definitely a cougar, not a bobcat (which I have seenin the wild) and not a big dog. Sally & John Williams Nov 12, 2012 Antioch , TN tan This past Saturday me and my husband went for a drive in the country. We were coming from Old Hickory Rd to catch Cane Ridge Rd to cruz through some country side. As soon as we turned on Old Hickory there it was, right in front of us crossing the road. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. It didn't even act afraid of us and casually walked right across the road and back into the woods. We were stunned. Bigger than any bobcat I have ever seen in my lifetime. I used to live and work in Yosemite National Park. I am aware of what a bobcat looks like. .. and that outs no bobcat. It looked just like a mountain lion. I almost felt as if we should stop and knock on doors to warn the people in the area. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself. Anonymous Nov 7, 2012 Brentwood/Antioch, TN Light Tan Last fall 2011 I thought I saw a bobcat cross the road near my house. My mind immediately said \"this is dog sized cat\" when I first saw it. This would have been my first bobcat sighting, so I was excited. I went to tell my buddies about it, and they said \"yea they have short tails.\" What I saw did not have a short tail, but a long one.\n\nSo for past year I thought my friends were mistaken that bobcats have short tails. I didn't know what else to call it. Keep reading and this will come together.\n\nI was deer hunting 11/4/12. I had been seeing some deer in the field I was hunting and used to that size of an animal. Right before dark I looked to my right @ 35-40 yards away and saw what my brain automatically processed as a \"dog sized cat.\" It was just there. I immediately said \"everyone is going to ask me if it had a short tail\" so I looked the whole time.\n\nIt was getting dark but I know 100% that it had a long tail!\n\nI thought for a sec it could be a coyote since it was getting dark, but it had a distinct hop when it went off to the creek. At a slow speed \"trot\" it hopped using both back feet at the same time, then the front two feet at the same time. I dont know if this helps but it looked cat like.\n\nAnyways, I got back home and told my roommate who has killed a bobcat before about the story. I said \"I think i saw a bobcat when i was hunting\" He said yea they have short tails. I immediately said this did not have a short tail...100% no doubts. He said it may be a mountain lion. I didn't know they existed here, so I started reading and saw the news reports.\n\nMy mom runs at the park across from the Willowmet neighborhood in Brentwood, TN which has been in the news stories about the sighting. We live close to this area.\n\nI also heard 3 times while hunting earlier that day an ear piercing \"woman screaming like screech\" I got on Youtube and looked up an female cougar mating call and I was astonished at the similarity in what I heard.\n\nI am assuming what I saw last fall was not a bobcat, but another cougar. And I am 90% sure I saw one this past weekend.\n\nS. Angel Oct 29, 2012 Interstate 40W close close to smith county line, TN Tan It was around midnight I was driving down the interstate and I saw movement on my left side. I expected to see a deer and I began to slow down because it is not unusual to see deer and they tend to run in front of your vehicle ,as I got closer and my lights caught the animal was still and it's head was down toward the ground and appeared to be eating something. It was obviously not a deer it was larger than a dog and its body shape and long tail looked exactly like a mountain lion or cougar. The tail moved like a domestic cat but it was so much larger than a cat or dog. I wish I had not been on the interstate so I could have turned around and investigated further or had had time to make a picture! Dawna Beasecker Oct 5, 2012 Kodak, TN Tan I saw what i thought was a mountain lion last fall/winter '11. It was about 5 am and I was turning around in the circle at the top part of my neighborhood which borders the French broad river. It was a young one, probably the size of a....well at least 50 pounds and had the long tail. It turned and looked at my car headlights and went into the tall grasses, it did not run. I couldn't believe my eyes but I know what I saw. At the time I could not find much on the Internet about sightings in East Tn but tonight I heard from someone at the local Kodak trade center store had seen one...this is also close to river approx. three miles from where I saw the young one. J. Martin Sep 30, 2012 Hickory Withe/Oakland Near Loosahatchie River/I-40, TN tan I recently purchased my husband a new trail cam for his birthday, he put it on a tree in our back field a few days ago. To our shock & surprise this morning when we checked it there was a picture of a large Cougar! It took a while for it to sink in, but sure enough we have a big cat on our property! My husband thought he saw one about 3 years ago, 350-400 yards away, near the same area but passed it off to be a very large house cat or bob cat. Also, our neighbor, that seems to have many \"tall tales\", told us that he had actually tried to shoot at two Cougars a few years ago when they were trying to get his hunting dogs. I would have never believed it before, but now there is no doubt. wathon wilbanks Sep 13, 2012 Milledgeville, TN tan saw it first about 200 yards away wasn't for sure what it was, so I went int the house and grabbed my rifle, pulled it up close and almost pulled the trigger, then like an idiot I walked to where I saw it and then I saw a baby run back into the woods looked to be about 6-8 inches tall, George Arkoosh Sep 9, 2012 Petersburg, TN Brown Sept 9 2012 The mountain lion (cougar) ran across the service road on my farm, while I was cutting grass. This is my third sighting in 5 years. George Sam Miller Aug 25, 2012 Monterey, TN Light Brown My wife and I were driving my motorcycle east from Monterey on 62 around 6:45pm on August 25, 2012. We were traveling about 45 mph. About 3 miles out of town as we came around a bend, I saw the cougar come out of the woods on the south side of the road and cross to the north about 50 feet in front of me. It was running slowly and took about 4 or 5 strides to cross the road. I noticed it's rounded ears, long tail with a dark tip on the end, and it's uniform light brown fur color. The cougar was in sight for about 5 seconds. I would estimate it to be about the height of our Great Pyrenees but longer and all of 100 lbs. What a beautiful cat! Resident Jul 9, 2012 McMinnville, TN Tan Someone hit and killed a medium tan cougar on HWY 108 3 miles outside McMinnville late Saturday night early Sunday morning July 7th - 8th. We observed it roadside at 7am. It was gone when we drove through again at 9am. The head was very damaged. Having grown up in Florida I was well aware of what the animal was, and didn't even know they lived around here before seeing it. KT Jun 28, 2012 Lascassas (Rutherford Co), TN wheat..blended well into the dried field grass Yesterday our Great Pyrnees barked her I'm-about-to-eat-you bark and growl most the day. I could tell that something wasn't right in her environment but never saw a stray dog or visitor when I would glance outside. Last night our Golden Retriever barked a high-pitched sound a good portion of the night. This morning I was getting into the truck and something caught my eye in the southwest corner of our back field, next to the dry creek bed and the border between us and the neighbor. My first thought was \"THAT is NO dog, but what is it?\" It was sitting on its hauches but head and shoulders above the field grass which needs to be bushhogged (about 2.5 ft tall grass). We were eyeing each other. I was still trying to figure out what it was but knew it was no dog. Then, it stood up and sat down again. I got in the truck and slowly drove toward it. We kept staring each other down but he showed no fear. As I drew closer I knew it was a cougar but was so surprised that I didn't think to get out my camera phone to take a photo. (It wouldn't have turned out well anyway through the truck glass.) I was able to slowly drive up toward it until I was about 10 or so yards away. I watched in utter amazement as he just stood up, slowly turned around and saundered back along the creek bed and behind my neighbors' field. Wow! He was the color of dried wheat or a tan. I am not good at estimating sizes but can say that I thought of a Great Dane when I saw him at first. He had short hair, very long tail which seemed to have a tuft of hair on the tip...either that or it was darker brown. It was NOT a coyote or fox or dog or a bobcat. I know what animals look like and this was a cougar. I am also not crazy. ha! My guess is that he is looking for water during this drought and 103 degree heat. Throughout the day, I explained my sighting to several people. Others told me today that they had seen a cougar in Milton, Readyville, and here in Lascassas. Another fellow said his dad has seen them at his Lynchburg farm. Another said that he saw one when he was fishing at Tim's Ford. Jeff Via Mar 8, 2012 Bells, TN Tan Walking from the house to the lake with my lab and girlfriend at the time, at dusk and the cat ran across the road in front of us. Was in shock, could not believe what I had just saw. As we made it to the spot where the cat crossed, the lab took to the trail but came back soon. Glad to see there is a site for folks to tell what many don't believe. Cindi Whitman Feb 26, 2012 Franklin, TN tan I was looking out at the pond behind our house at the geese that were squacking loudly. I saw a large \"cat like\" animal on the bank of the pond. I ran to get the binoculars. I'm certain it was not a bobcat, as we've seen those before and the body shape was different. It had the face of a cougar. The grass is tall where he went so I couldn't see his tail.\n\nWe've lived in this house for 17 years and this is the only time that we've seen an animal like this.\n\nHenry Delones Feb 4, 2012 Gallatin, TN tan I was taking a motorcycle course at volunter state community collage in april 2010 we were taking a break in the parking lot near the ball field when a large tan colored cat with a body about four foot long and a tail nearly that long walked just outside a growed up field in the grass we watched the cat close to a minute before it walked into the tall grass and disappered talking with the other riders there we said it had to be a cougar A.Holt Feb 2, 2012 Tellico plains,tn (se tn), TN Tan Grew up in east tn I know what bear, bobcat, and any other native wildlife in the area and what their tracks look like. Well I was squirrel hunting one day about ten years ago on my property. I used to always open my barn door and sit in it and wait for the squirrels to bounce on the roof to get to my pecan tree all I hunted with was a single shot 20ga with 7 1/2 bird shot. I opened the door and was astonished and scared to death when I looked up into the rafters and saw a large puma looking down on me. So I pointed my pointless shotgun at it and slowly stepped back and closed the door and went back to the house. I didn't hunt again for prob 2 wks. I never seen anything of it again till about last year. We had local reports in the area of a lot of pumas in the area again. Around Christmas we had about 8\" of snow and as I walked my dog around the same barn about 30 yards from the first sighting I saw a track I wasn't familiar with at all. Again I grew up in the area I know what a bobcat and bear tracks look like. So I took a pic of it with my iPhone and compared it to the national autobahn society field guide to north American mammals, it matched up perfectly to the mountain lion.\n\nReporter Date Location Color Jessica Mash Oct 19, 2011 outside of Lexington, TN tan/fawn 10/05/2011 I was driving down 104 going out of Lexington looking for property, I turned down a road to the left just after a trucking/stable place on the right. I went down this road for about a mile or so off of 104 (only 1 house on this road) when I saw something run in front of me....it was the a fawn color (tan) ran like a domestic cat, bigger than a dog, just amazing!!! David J. Oct 9, 2011 Bolivar, TN Tan I was bow hunting for deer on 10-7-11 from a ground blind on Sain Road about 1-mile north of Lake Hardeman Road near Bolivar, TN.\n\nI saw something come out of the woods about 60 yards away. I first thought it was a coyote, but it didn't walk like a coyote. After watching it walking across an open field, I discovered it had a face somewhat like a bobcat and a long tail.\n\nIt was about 3'long and about 2' tall. I would guess it to weigh about 80-90 pounds. It's tail was almost dragging the ground.\n\nWhen it turned and looked toward me, I knew it was a mountain lion. Several weeks before, I had seen some large tracks in the mud but thought nothing about it.\n\nE.Dearborn Sep 28, 2011 Ashland City, TN Light Brown/Beige I went to open the front door to let my dog out and sit on the porch when my head immediately turned to the right and standing next to my house, in my gravel driveway 50ft from my porch, was a VERY large animal that I had never seen before. This animal was at least 100lbs, had a very long tail that curled up like a cats would and had the tall, lean build of a Great Dane breed of dog. Very unusual (not having seen one) and I obviously was startled because IT was staring at ME (most likely - my dog). I immediately turned to my dog and forced him back inside before he could realize what was going on then came back out on to the front porch and the animal was gone.\n\nBetween the time I realized there was an animal staring at me and the time I stepped back outside could not have been any more than 5 or 8 seconds - at most. It was gone and I didn't see nor hear where it went.\n\nA very quick sighting, yes, but it was also a very up-close and personal sighting. A little too close for comfort.\n\nFeather Burns Sep 2, 2011 Natchez Trace, TN Tan Leaving Nashville last night, around 10 o'clock at night, about 45 miles down the Trace from Nashville. Saw what was definitely a large feline, tan, and about the size of my Black Lab. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I'm used to seeing Mountain Lions, so I am absolutely certain it was a mountain lion (cougar). High beam headlights illuminated it perfectly on the hillside beside the road. I hit the brakes immediately, but of course it was gone! We've seen coyote, foxes, and lots of deer on our forays down the Trace, but I was astounded to see this! Wendy Abrams Sep 1, 2011 Between Rutherford & Dyer, TN Tan On 08/31/2011 at around 7:20 AM, I was traveling south in the left lane on 45 W Bypass. Between Rutherford and Dyer, I saw a large animal walking in the grass median from several yards away. I immediately slowed down, and as I got closer to it I realized that it was a large cat (not a coyote--which is what I was expecting). It had a graceful stride. I remember seeing a tail. As my car approached, it sat down on it's hind legs and was calmly looking around at it's surrounding moving it's head from left to right. As I drove by, I got a very good look at it's face. I thought \"mountain lion\". I am almost certain now that it was a cougar. It did not have spots. It's tail did not appear short or stubby. It was a very sleek, beautiful animal. Robert Stith Sep 1, 2011 Long Branch Lakes, Spencer, Van Buren County, TN Tan / Red While working construction on a new home in Long Branch Lakes, I watched the Cougar cross a field walking very swiftly and fade into the woodline. Marcus Clagg Aug 25, 2011 Soddy Daisy, TN Tan I have had several sightings in a TVA power line area . A heavey deer populated area. The mountain lion is a golden tan , long tail and I am guesing about 200lbs . I am not a hunter , but enjoy veiwing such a beautiful sight ! I am comparing its size to my 200lb mastiff. I contacted the TWRA , they say it doesnt exist , I am a local Pastor and no reason to lie , lol R . Flory Aug 9, 2011 Clay Co, TN Yellowish gold This cat came into a friend of mines back yard . When they came outside to see why the dogs were barking so hard and long they seen this big golden color cat jump from the ground into a near by tree and watch them for about 15 minutes then ran off into the woods.

David Dutton Jul 13, 2011 White House , TN tan I was coming home from a night shift at 3:20am was on the 31W highway between Honey run creek road and Overview rd on 7/12/11. I had to slam on my breaks to stop from hitting it. It was running across the road at a very fast pace. It passed about 3-5 feet in front of my car in the head lights. It looked very thin almost as if it was sick. It had short Tan fur but looked dirty. It had a long tail. was not a bob cat. Barbara E. Jun 21, 2011 Brentwood, TN medium brown I was travelling down Old Smyrna Road in Brentwood at around 5:50pm. I had just passed Jones Parkway, when a large cat crossed the road in front of me from coming from the land I believe is called Sneed Acres. It crossed the road, climbed up the stacked stone wall on the other side, and stood there a moment, looking back at the road. Then it went over the wall and into the field behind. I drove a few yards further down the road till I came to a place where I could see the field behind the wall, and I saw the cougar running trough the field. It stopped again and looked back at the road. I had stopped my car to watch it cross the field, but another car ran up behind me and and I was forced to move on. It was big and sleek with medium brown short fur, long muscular legs, and a long tail with short fur. I've seen coyotes in this same area before, but this was my first cougar! Barbara E. Jun 21, 2011 Brentwood, TN medium brown I was travelling down Old Smyrna Road in Brentwood at around 5:50pm. I had just passed Jones Parkway, when a large cat crossed the road in front of me from coming from the land I believe is called Sneed Acres. It crossed the road, climbed up the stacked stone wall on the other side, and stood there a moment, looking back at the road. Then it went over the wall and into the field behind. I drove a few yards further down the road till I came to a place where I could see the field behind the wall, and I saw the cougar running trough the field. It stopped again and looked back at the road. I had stopped my car to watch it cross the field, but another car ran up behind me and and I was forced to move on. It was big and sleek with medium brown short fur, long muscular legs, and a long tail with short fur. I've seen coyotes in this same area before, but this was my first cougar! Anna Wilt Jun 16, 2011 Franklin, TN tan/light brown As I was running along the sidewalk in my subdivision, I looked over at the large patch of forest across the road from me. In the clearing I saw a large cat. At first glance, I thought it was someone's golden retriever, but I looked again and saw that it was not shaggy, was much larger than any dog, had a long body, a cat-like face, and a long tail with a rounded tip. Marcus Clagg Jun 2, 2011 Soddy Daisy, TN Tan March 7, 2011 saw a large golden tan Cougar chasing a squirrell early morning . Since that date there has been several more sightings in the same area. hunter byrd May 27, 2011 millington,tn, TN tan we drove down hwy 51 leaving millington to munford and saw a big cat on the edge of a field by a block of woods,it had a dark tan color and it was facing the hwy and it had a long tail and short ears and was much bigger than a bobcat Richard Dugger May 25, 2011 Kingsport, TN brown/white (tan) It was on top of a small hill behind Brookside Storage on Brookside Drive. I thought it a large cat. It walked down the hill to a fence corner and was smelling about. I took a terrible picture with a cheap cellphone camera. I was about 70 yds away. I estimate 5 ft about 100-150 lbs. I am terrible at estimating weight. It was about 2 pm. It was probably 4/26/11 that appears to be the date on the picture. I got scared and left the area. If you want the bad picture, I will send it. It may be able to be enhanced. May 16, 2011 Arlington, TN Brown I took the 385 exit going to Arlington off of I40 and to the right there was a very large cat headed to a field with a few turkey. The cat was croutched down making its was into the field. The cat looked to be larger than my two great danes which both weigh close to 140 lbs. Rachel May 7, 2011 Fairview, TN beige I was driving back to Nashville from Fairview on hwy 100 around 10:45pm on May 6. I quickly stopped the car when I saw what appeared to be a mountain lion shifting about getting ready to dart from the right shoulder across the road in front of me. It froze for a second and I got a clear look at it be for it disappeared back down into the woods. I most certainly believe this was a cougar. robert d lamberth Apr 18, 2011 smyrna, TN golden brown near one mile road and stweart creek, Sunday april 17-2011 I was cutting grass at this property at 3 pm and someone was burning brush on the other side of the creek and I looked up and about 50 yards away on the creek bank it came out of the heavy brush and went about 25 yards and went back in the brush along the creek bank,I tried to get my phone to take a picture but could not, in time, it was not running it just walked out of the brush and then back in, I just was amazed at it and notice that it had a small white tip on its tail.and was a golden brown in color. Marcus Clagg Apr 4, 2011 Soddy Daisy, TN Tan On 4/01/2011 , seen a tan Mtn Lion chasing a squirrel under some TVA Power lines at around 7 :00 in the evening. It looked to be about 200lbs with a tan color. clay wright Jan 23, 2011 Dunlap, TN brown/tan Stopped roadside above Little Brush Creek off 111N out of Dunlap and was looking down into the gorge when a large cat stood up from among the road-blasted rocks 20 yards below me. We stood and stared for a minute, but then I looked over at the truck (to gauge how quick I could get in) and when I looked back he was off the rocks and heading for the woods. He was not 'big and powerful' I would guess 60 lbs, 2.5' high, very thin and his coat was uneven .. mangy looking. The long tail and sway-back body let me know it wasn't a Bobcat even though the size was similar. Someone had tossed some deer carcasses in the area and I think he was scavenging. Sandy Farmer Jan 21, 2011 Big Sandy , TN fawn I submitted earlier about my daughter Julia seeing the big cat, but forgot to give you the year and area. It was Lick creek area, and the year was 2006. Sandy Farmer Jan 21, 2011 Big Sandy, TN fawn My youngest daughter, Julia was returning home from work one night about midnight, preparing to turn into our driveway when she slammed on her breaks. She called me from her cell phone. She drove a Nissan Sentra, she was scared to death. She said it was taller than the hood of her car and it looked like a big cat. It looked at her, and she said it had gold eyes. She nearly hit it and was really shook up. She said it had a long tail and asked me what it was. From what she discribed I said Mountain Lion, or cougar. Jim Tumbrink Jan 7, 2011 Memphis, TN Dark Brown I was walking on the new greenline trail in Shelby Farms. I had just walked over the Wolf River pedestrian bridge close to Humphries Blvd. and a large dark brown colored cat ran across the path about 15 yds. in front of me. It was pretty cool. Very large and stocky looking with a very long furry tail. Its body was about 4' and the tail about 3'. I reported it to the park rangers and they said there have been other sitings but not recently.\n\nReporter Date Location Color Ricky Crihfield Dec 31, 2010 Tibbs community, TN Tan While going to work in Brownsville, TN in August of 2007 I spotted a large cat on a field road in the Tibbs community. I continued up the road and turned around and coasted back to the spot where the cat stood up and walked off to the woods. Probably about 6 feet long from head to tail. About 100 pounds or so. Mike Hensley Dec 29, 2010 Buffalo, TN Brown My wife and I were going home from Mufreesboro after visiting her parents and brother. I saw the large cat as we were driving down I-40 near Buffalo and just before we got to the Land Between the Lakes Zone. It was in a clearing bent over eating something. it had a long tail and I immediately thought it was either a Cougar or Mountain Lion, but this far east I figured it was a Cougar. It is the first time I have ever seen one in the wild. Don McGahan Dec 27, 2010 N.E. Wayne County, TN Brown Highway 99 approaching Allens Creek intersection. I have seen a medium-sized cat cross the highway two different times in the last two years. Looked to be about 4 feet long including the tail. My neighbor, Steve Brown explained how a much larger cat crossed in fron of him on Allens Creek Road. Now that I know about this Forum to report sighting, I will report on a more timely basis. Mark Gary Dec 26, 2010 Franklin, TN Tan At 2am on 12,26,2010 I went out on the balcony for a smoke. As I stood there watching the snow come down I saw a coyote cross the road and trot along like he had somewhere to be. I think I saved his life because as I was watching him I saw another animal come out of the ravine and begin to follow him. I thought it was another coyote until it came into the light and I realized it was Cougar. It was 2x the size of the coyote. The Coyote went on passed me without ever even looking up but the cougar must have smelt my cig or something because he looked directly at me and turned back into the ravine. The coyote kept going on up the road totally unaware of how close he had just come to being Cat Chow. I am new to TN and this was the most awesome experience with nature Ive had. The are we are in is County just outside of Franklin. Abington Ridge ln the 96 are the crossroads of the sighting. Counterman Dec 24, 2010 Crossville , TN Tan My family and I moved here in 2006, purchasing 40+ acres near Browntown Rd off Hwy 70...while the land was being cleared, this big beautiful cat emerged from the woods and crossed the path that would soon be my driveway. It was an amazing, but very scary sight....a predator that size near my home isn't a welcomed one.I have seen her tracks every year since, or that of her young.That winter of 2006 we saw prints of an adult with cub prints following at the property edge. I have since invested in an outdoor camera,but unfortunately no capture on film,as of yet.... Stan Hodson Dec 14, 2010 Stewart County, in LBL, TN Brown I was driving in Land Between the Lakes last week.\n\nI like to video wildlife in LBL. I have done this for the past 19 years.\n\nI was driving down Tharpe Road in the Tennessee side of LBL in the evening.\n\nI watched a Cougar cross a cut soeybean field. It was about 200 yards away from the road.\n\nIt would have been in hunting area 15 on the south side of Tharpe Road.\n\nI am certain it was a cougar, however I can't say for sure if it was a pet or if it was a wild Cougar.\n\nMom & Daughter Dec 8, 2010 Franklin/Murfreesboro, TN (Off of Hwy 96), TN Dark Golden Tan/Brown Time of Report: Late Summer '06\n\nMy child and I travel from Franklin to Murfreesboro on a regular basis commuting from work and home. We will often gaze at pastures for horses, goats, and cows.\n\nNot sure what day it was since I am just know adding it to this place since I didn't know there was a place you could record this type of sighting. I do remember it was '06 in the late summer because it was still daylight when driving around 6:00 pm and the school year hadn't started yet. I was on the phone with my father, and on the right in a pasture/open field, a large cat ran across the field. It would leap a little so I was able to see its hind legs. I told my father, who is from this area for over 60 years what I saw, and he said \"no-way. There are not cougars in this area\". So I dismissed it, but I know it was a cougar. I don't have fantasies about seeing cougars in this area, so why would anyone make something like this up. Silly really, and who cares if TWRA (whoever they are) doesn't believe people seeing this animal. Really....what are they going to do if they believed you? You still can't change the fact that these cats live here in Middle TN, and I am sure they do not use birth control, so they are bound to reproduce. I am also sure that they could live in this climate, so why in the world is the TWRA in such disbelief?? Very strange to me. I thought it was cool seeing it run across the field. The thing that caught my eye to look at it was the tail. It was a long tail that the cat held slightly above its body while running. I stopped the car, pulled over, and just stared until it ran completely across the field into a thick wooded area. I can't remember if I was more on the Rutherford county side or the Williamson County side. I believe it was the Williamson county side. My dad still doesn't believe it. Oh well, I think it was very cool! I hope I see another some day!\n\nRonny Clift Dec 7, 2010 Middleton,TN, TN Brown December 7th 2010 I noticed a brown object about 300 yards from the house and first thought it was a deer. I got my optics and noticed what appeared to be a large brown cougar. Early morning sighting. I did have a horse, 3 months ago injured with an unexplainded injury to its rear hip. This might explain what happened. Brian Barnett Dec 5, 2010 Pegram, TN Fawn On December 2, 2010, at approximately 6:00 am, I was driving southbound on McCrory Lane near highway 100 and the Natchez Trace. In an area where the road cuts a through a hill, I noticed a large fawn colored animal cross the road. At first, I thought it might have been a young deer, but then I noticed its long, thick tail as the animal crossed in front of me. My first impression was a large bobcat, but after researching, the tail does not match and the size of the animal I saw was much larger than a bobcat. I am glad to see others in this area have had cougar sightings, otherwise I might not believe what I saw. Absolutely incredible experience. john gunn Nov 28, 2010 springfield, TN tan Traveling down I-24 towards Nashville, between exit 24 and 31, I saw an animal in the distance crossing the Interstate. I initially thought it was a dog, and worried that it would be hit since it seemed as if it had never seen a vehicle before. It was almost hit by a car, and then it spun around and I noticed at that time that it had the face of a cat, pointy ears, but large, more like the size of a 100 pound dog. It crossed the interstate and then it went into the woods. Other cars must have seen it as well. This was the Sunday of Thanksgiving. Gregory Fassler Nov 22, 2010 Paris , TN Tan My neighbor Mark Thompson was hunting this past Saturday (11-20-2010)morning when he called me to tell me that he had seen a cougar cross in front of him and jump the creek that lies between our 2 farms and head up on my South West ridge. He said it was about 4 to 5 feet long with a very long tail. The creek that he crossed runs in a deep bottom for a very long ways that connects with a TVA flood control pond. Sherrie Cates Nov 1, 2010 Halls, TN tan a few weeks ago (sometime in Oct 2010) my husband, 14 yr old daughter and myself took the back roads home from Dyersburg. We were at the end of Steelman Rd, where it crosses Edith-Nankipoo and I saw a beautiful tan big cat just laying in the road like it was stalking something in the weeds just off the road. It was early evening, My husband swerved to miss it then backed up to get a closer look. I thought it might be a bobcat until we saw it get up and trot up the road. It was close to the color of a deer with a long tale. We were surprised that it did not move when we passed it, but looked off the road and saw a rabbit. I believe it was stalking the rabbit. After researching sightings and looking at pictures I know I saw a cougar. I'll probably never see one again but I'll never forget how big and beautiful he was. He did not seem scared or dash off. He just trotted up the road in the other direction until we lost sight of him. Blake Oct 29, 2010 Lake county - great river road, TN Tan Was sitting on a deer stand off great river road right on the river. The cat came from my back left and went in front of me at about seventy five yards. It was huge. I have killed several big bobcats but they had nothing on this cat. it's tail was as long as a normal bobcat. If I had a rifle rather than a bow he would've been one dead cat! The woods I was sitting in was a natural funnel with a cut bean field to my back and the river directly in front of me.. Michael & Michelle Poirier Oct 10, 2010 Arrington, TN Tan / Buff We saw the cat at 8:30am on Sunday morning as we sat outside drinking coffee. Tan colored about 50-60lbs Very long tail with a lighter tuft at the end.. It was stalking a tree line about 200 feeet away. We were able to walk within 100 feet. Have seen many in West Texas when we lived there. Was shocked to see on in our Tennessee neighborhood. David Huwe Oct 6, 2010 Corinth, MS light brown Can't recall the exact date, but it was in September, 2010. I was driving home when I saw the cougar. It was loping across County Road 152 at Seven Mile Creek in Alcorn County, just east of Corinth. It was larger than most dogs, was very sleek in appearance with a long, extended tail. Its gait was definitely cat-like. My first reaction was, \"Couldn't be!\" However, I really don't think it could have been anything else - I just hadn't heard of any in the area, except stories of a retired Boy Scout camp ranger in the Pontotoc, MS area. Benida Blackburn Oct 1, 2010 Columbia, TN Grayish brown On October 1, 2010, I was traveling west on Iron Bridge Road. Just as I was about to cross the 1 lane bridge this very large cat casually ran across the road directly in front of me! It was beautiful! I immediately grabbed my cell phone and called my husband and told him about it. I know it wasn't a bob cat or any kind of house cat, it was much to big for that. After viewing pictures of cougars, I believe that is what I saw. I had no idea there was cougars in Tennessee. P Hooten Sep 21, 2010 Bruceton, TN fawn colored On 7/1/2010 my husband and I watched as a large cat approx 3 feet long with a long tail crossed the country road near my home. It was about 10:00 a.m. It disappeared into the woods on the other side of the road. James Sep 21, 2010 Dekalb County (Temperance Hall area of county), TN light brown The sighting occured in the late 90s, my grandfather had been talking about spotting this large cat in a remote area of Temperance Hall while fishing.I thought he was exaggerating about the size of that cat or just had caught a glimpse of something and was just leading me on a wild goose chase. On one of the following mornings after he supposley spotted the cat me and him set off to the location with a gun, binoculars, and a camera. We ended up at the end of a old dirt road and walked down a path that opened up into a beautiful valley with a good size creek/river flowing threw it. We set up and started fishing and just carrying on like we would on any normal day, my grandfather then pointed out where he spotted the cat up on a rock ledge in the hills of the valley at a higher elevation. We sat there for hours and I was growing restless but my pa kept saying be patient, and finally we heard it first then a few minutes later it came into our view at around 200 yards away. It was standing next to a fallen tree and after it left we went up there to get a better accurate measurement of its size by comparing it to the tree. We estimated it to be right around 5 to 5 1/2 feet long and roughly 75-90 lbs. Over the years I have repeately went back to the location with friends hoping to see it again, but I only ever seen it one more time about 6 months after the first time I spotted it, and this time it was in the dead of winter and its fur/coat looked to be thicker and a darker brown. We did take a picture and I will post it as soon as I am able to go to my grandmothers house when she is home, my grandfather has passed but she has always kept the picture. Billy Bell (as told to Rob Martin of Halls, TN) Sep 8, 2010 Gates (1 1/2 miles west of Gates along Hwy 180), TN dark tan Sitting after dusk on back porch, cougar was seen by Mr. Bell about 100 feet from his house, crossing directly under a yard light. The cat paused beside a large shrub, before continuing along into neighbor's yard. The cat stood about 18 inches high at shoulder, and had a long tail, as long as the body. Eric Engler Sep 3, 2010 Weakley County, TN tan 09/03/2010 I spotted a tan cougar on top of our trash burn pile on our property about 7:30 pm. It jumped off the fire pit and walked into the woods. The cougar was about 5 foot long about 100 pounds. Wallace Shands Jul 19, 2010 Henning TN (fort pillow), TN Tan I was on 87 not far from my house on my way to work when it came a cross the road in front of me and I stop and watch it go up a hill in the woods. Margaret Massa Jul 15, 2010 Fall Creek Falls State Park (284 above Nature Cent, TN yellowish July 14th, 2010 while returning via highway 284 after hiking most of the Upper Loop Overnight Trail with another TTA member at around 4 PM we were startled by a deer bursting over the hill above the Nature Center, snorting and bounded past us on the road. In got pursuit behind it was the cougar who stopped abruptly when it saw us and turned back into the woods. It all happened so quickly and I felt in such a busy, heavily populated area. From a view near by looking over were large groups of people sunning, swimming in the swimming hole, and picnicing. Just down the hill was the Nature Center with lots of people sightseeing, picnicing and hiking trails. I said to my companion, \"Was that a bobcat?\" He said no. It was bigger, had a long tail, and ears were different than a bobcat. All I knew for sure was it was not any domestic type cat as it was bigger. It happened so fast it left me reeling. I would not try to guess weight, but best I recollect it was not real big as compared to other pics I have seen of cougars in searches I have done. I was glad I was not alone; however, I have hiked alone but now see their is yet another thing to fear in the woods besides bears, snakes, and wild boar (I did see a group of wild boar at Scott's Gulf.) Kathleen O'Connor Jul 6, 2010 Ripley,TN. Lauderdale Co., TN Reddish-Tan Sighting took place in back yard.I saw a cougar, chestnut in color, in the morning of July the 6th,2010. It was about a quarter to seven am.The sleek and shiny animal was in a hunting mode as if stalking prey. It had a long swooping tail with a black tip pointing up. It went along the edge of the woods and then disappeared into the shade of a stand of trees. I live on the bluffs of the Chickasaw Wildlife Preserve above Chisholm Lake and have lived here 3 years. I originally came from San Diego Co. CA. There, we had the large tan mountain lion with black markings on the face and tail tip. This beautiful animal I saw today was different in color, about as large and hope to see again. Barry Matlock Jun 26, 2010 Natchez Trace Parkway, mile 413, TN tan I was cycling on the Natchez Trace, when suddenly a large cat emerged from the brush over to the left and came down onto the road to cross just as I was approaching. I was startled by the size of it, and immediately shifted gears and increased speed hoping to get quickly past and away. As soon as my shifter clicked it looked up, saw me, and turned and ran back the way it came. (We scared each other, I think!) I was about 30-35 yards from it when it emerged, and closer still when it turned and ran back. I've never seen a cougar in the wild before, but it certainly had the color and build of one--definitely a cat, not a dog or coyote; far too big for a domestic cat; long tail, solid color, quite sleek and lean, and very short-haired (no spots, tufted ears, mane or bobtail like a bobcat or lynx). If it was a cougar, it must have been a juvenile, guessing from the size of it--I'ed say about 4 feet long (longer if the tail were extended), standing a bit less than 2 feet tall. billy m. england May 20, 2010 nunnilly, TN brown may 11,at 1145 am in hickman county a large cat crossed the road infront of me and my wife as i turned off route 230 at the rock field church of christ. the cougar was only 20 yards away as it crossed the road. the cat was brownish in color long tail and weighing well over 100 lbs. the cat leaped from the road up on to a bank over twice his length in one leap. the cat was very large at least 6 ft nose to tail. it was no bob cat. i would hate to meet this cat in the woods face to face with out a gun. billy and kathy england May 16, 2010 centerville , TN light brown my wife and i were driving on 230 in hickman county we were about two miles south of i-40 going toward nunnelly tn we made a right turn on a black top road at the rock field church of christ when a large cat crossed the road infront of us. it was a cougar or mountain lion what ever you want to call it. cat was light brown and seven foot from nose to tail weighing well over 100 lbs. i have seen cougars before and this was the largest cougar i have seen. the cat was verry fat and well feed. twra can say that there are no cougars in middle tn but we know what we saw. date of sighting tuesday may 11 20010 at 1145 am. Elizabeth Hohe May 10, 2010 knoxville TN, TN Tan (Color of a Deer) I was coming home from the neighborhood food city when out of the bushes jumped a very long tan Cat. I thought it was a deer at first because of the color but then I saw it was sleek and had a very long tail. I noticed that It's ears were very short as well. INCREDIBLE! The scary part is that where it came from was a neighborhood. dan brown May 8, 2010 middleton, TN tan In about 1980 I was driving to work early one morning going south on hwy 125 near the MS state line. Next to a small bridge was standing a large cat-definitely a panther. I stopped the car and watched it for about a minute. It froze in its tracks(with a rabbit in its mouth) and did not move until I cracked the window a little- I wanted to see what it would do when it got my scent. Sure enough then it took off. This is the only one I've ever seen, but they have been reported in this area my whole life(I'm 52) and even before for years, according to older people.My sister still hears them screaming behind her house. She only lives about a couple miles from this area. Clint Brake Apr 25, 2010 Exit 35 I-40, TN Tan 3/18/10 at 11 P.M. full moonlight. I saw a fully grown Cougar on the side of the interstate waiting to cross after my truck passed by it. I had a really good look from my head lights and the moon light was very bright that night. This was at the 36 mile marker on I-40 and the cat was crossing from the south to the north. About two weeks later I am pretty sure I saw this one or another one at the 34 mile marker. The first sighting was unmistakable. Exit 35 is just outside the Shelby County line. Ben Stewart Apr 16, 2010 Murray , KY Brown/Tan I seen a cougar last week when I was driving along the Trace in LBL. I was scouting for the upcoming 2010 Kentucky Turkey season. And when I was driving through Land Between the lakes recreation area, along the Trace, I had a cougar walk across the road in front of me.\n\nI am 100% sure it was a cougar. It's amazing to me how cougar can still live around here. I have hunted around here for 22 years, and I have lived here for 40 years. This is the first Cougar I have ever seen.\n\nEd Apr 10, 2010 Gatlingburg, TN Light brown While driving on rt 441 from Cherokee nc to gatlingburg tn a mountain lion ran out in front of our car . It was light brown in color about 2 ft tall and 4 ft long , not including the tail. Looked to be around 100 pounds. It had something in it's mouth which looked to be a bird. We were shocked to see this, but glad we didn't hit it with the car. Paula Monteleone-Ezell Mar 25, 2010 Bumpus Mills, TN yellow I own about 2 arcres of land where my home is located off Hwy 120 in a small farming community. Directly behind my house is a very large wooded hill least a couple of miles long that takes you up to Saline Creek.\n\nIt was around 11:00 a.m. on 03/25/10 when I spotted a light yellow large animal at the bottom of the hill roughly 30 feet from my home.\n\nAt first I thought it was a dog about 4 ft. long and possible weight around 70 lbs. Then I noticed the cat like features. It slowly made its way up the hill and disapeared into the woods.\n\nThis is not the first time it has been sighted. A neighbor had spotted the it right before the Christmas holidays.\n\nMy neighbors and I have all been on alert for fear of an attack on our children, dogs and horses.\n\nI am originally from Michigan and have only seen a wild cat in a zoo. It was truly a moment that I felt connected to nature.\n\nRonald Rogers Mar 10, 2010 JACKSON, TN Light Tan On Saturday night March 6 at abot 9:45, I had just turned south on the Hy.45 By-Pass off of the Ashport Road so my speed was about 30 MPH. THe cat crossed directly in front of me and when it reached the right shoulder of the highway it turnd to face the road. The long tail that dipped in the middle was very evident in my headlights as I went by. I am sure that it was a cougar for on Friday, I had seen several stuffed ones in a mature center in Boise, ID. John Cole Feb 15, 2010 Martin, TN brown Feb 15th at about 6:15 AM I was heading south on 45E. Just south of Martin I saw what I believe to be a cougar run from a treeline to my left right toward my car. I braked as I thought I may hit it. The animal came to nearly a complete stop as I neared it. I passed in front of it and it crossed the road behind me. I have seen bobcats several times in the past and many coyotes along that route to work. This was neither. Eileen Thomas Feb 1, 2010 College Grove, TN brown, same color as the deer this time of year At 7:45 am Monday , February 1, 2010 my dogs began to bark, I looked out the window thinking it was just the deer of which we have quite a few. Clearly it was a cougar walking quickly across the snow in our backyard heading into the tree-line of our neighbors horse and cattle ranch. I thought it was a bobcat at first but there were no spots and it was too large. Cheryl Ewing Jan 5, 2010 Brentwood, TN Tan I am a Realtor in Middle Tennessee. I was showing a home yesterday, January 4, 2009 in the Willowmet Subdivision in Brentwood, Tennessee. The seller, future tenant, my daughter and I were standing in the kitchen of the home, when the future tenant says: \"What kind of cat is that?\" We all turned and looked out the large glass window to see a small cougar (around 100 lbs.) going back in the woods. It turned back around and came back to edge of woods,(we all got a good look at this time), and then turned around and went back into the woods. We thought it was a bobcat until I have since looked at pictures on the internet. It was a cougar. Trey Sugg Jan 4, 2010 Dickson, TN Yellowish/Tan This happened about 2 years ago. I was in a deer stand one morning on my grandparents land just barely south of interstate 40 in Dickson. It approached from the right and crossed right in front of me about 25 yards away at the closest. It was a yellowish tan solid color and about 3 feet long. At first, I thought it was some kind of dog. But when it got closer, I could see that it had the head of a cat. The coat of the animal was short and sleek. It didn't seem to notice me in the tree watching it. It was definitely not a bobcat. I reported to TWRA but they said they needed a body to officially report it.\n\nReporter Date Location Color Ryan Dec 19, 2009 LAND BETWEEN THE LAKES RECREATION AREA, TN BROWN I saw a cougar while walking in the woods in LBL, I seen the cougar a few weeks ago, I am sure it was a cougar, I was in the Tennessee portion of LBL, I thought it was a deer, but I seen quickly it was a cougar, it was about 200 yards away on the side of a ridge. I am positive it was a cougar, I told LBL staff, they said they have got several cougar sightings before. LBL is big enough to support a few cougars it's 170,000 acres of wilderness.\n\nI have heard many other people say that they have seen cougar in LBL, and in local areas.\n\nLiz Condie Dec 17, 2009 Between Carroll County & Hardin County, TN, TN Deep golden brown Driving along spotted a large animal in the distance chasing what appeared to be a mid-sized dog. Then another large animal appeared also giving chase. Never saw a mountain before so couldn't believe my eyes. When I studied photos realized that I had indeed seen two of them. Wow! Kirk Kissell Dec 15, 2009 Lauderdale County, Barr Community, TN Medium tan, Black on ears face and end of tail November 23 2009 while driving along Barr rd. at dusk just at the point where headlights were needed, I saw a large cat approx 70lbs with a long tail come from a steep ditch into the middle of the road. I was driving a patrol car so I turned the spotlight on to make sure of what i was seeing. There was no mistaking this for a bobcat ( which I am very familiar with). It opened its mouth (to growl or hiss?) then ran across the road into the woods.I live right in the middle of chickasaw nat. wildlife refuge and this is the first time i have seen a cat this size. I have heard the old timers talk of panthers, and have heard \"screams\" from deep in the woods near the river but this was my first big cat sighting. I have since found out that 2 other people have seen the same thing within a mile or two of where i spotted it. Alicia Heyman Dec 8, 2009 Nashville, TN tan I was driving on the 2 lane area of Old Hickory Blvd. between Charlotte Pike and Old Charlotte Pike. A cat the size of a cougar ran across the road from an area that is being developed and still has no buildings. The cat was the size of a cougar, the color or a cougar, with ears like a cougar, but it had a tail like a bobcat. The tail is what caught my attention because it was about a 8 inches to a foot long. Not long enough to be a typical cougar really. But the body was not a bobcat. It was a fairly big animal. Bigger than my Australian Shepherd (60 lbs). It leapt like a cat across the road but moved fairly calmly as if he knew that he needed to get going but was not really startled by the car. casey jones Dec 1, 2009 Collierville , TN tan/brown saw him/her along the wolf river bank outside of collierville. about 30 yards away. believe it was stalking me before i spotted it. Ken Mortimer Nov 23, 2009 Pleasantview, TN Grayish brown My sighting was actually of a dead cougar on the side of interstate 24 just west of mile marker 24. I was heading west about 8:30 a.m. when my son & I saw an animal right on the edge of the interstate. As we passed the animal we noticed that it was about 3 feet long and had a long tail. I would judge it to bee about 75-100 pounds. I was shocked because I had no idea that we had cougars in Middle Tennessee. eric [icklesimer Nov 18, 2009 burns, TN tan I was going to work on HWY96 about 6:00am it was dead on the side of the road.11/16/09 Lisa Cox Nov 10, 2009 North Shelby Co. , TN yellow Living in North Shelby county just about 2 miles from Losahatchie River bottoms. I was in our back yard & there are thick dense woods behind us. We are putting up a fence on the acreage so I was out there about 7:45 this morning checking out the t-post ( fencing not up yet) I had 4 little dogs with me. I heard a noise from behind me & my dogs took off barking like crazy. I caught something out of the corner of my eye & turned around & there not 40 ft from me was a HUGE cat. 3 - 3 1/2 ft tall golden yellow in color with a long tail. It turned & was gone in seconds. My dogs went after it but they were also scared back qucikly. They came yelping & and running to the house. All my friends think I am crazy & it was probably just a Bobcat but it had a long tail & this thing was BIG. I kid you not it was the size of a German Shepard dog. I am installing game cameras back there in hopes of proving what I saw. Bill Biggs Nov 9, 2009 Charlotte, TN Tan/Beige The time and date- 3:00pm Fri the 6th day of Nov. 2009. Ran out from underneath my dozer. The location was off Maple Valley Rd in Dickson Co. Tn. Half way between Charlotte and Ashland City. It wasnt a Bobcat or a domestic cat. It was tan in color, about 5 to 6 ft long and had a long tail. Very graceful has it ran off. I had been seeing some very large tracks prior to this sighting and thought it might be a mountain lion. J. Burleson Nov 3, 2009 Murfreesboro, TN redish brown I had just gotten on I24 leaving 840 to Nashville about 7:45 am Tuesday morning, November 3. The bob cat was about 10 to 15 feet off the highway walking in the grassy area toward Murfreesboro. There is a subdivision up on a hill just above where I saw the cat. To me it looked like a small female lion. There was redish brown on its back and the rest of it looked between light brown and tan. Dean Stahman Oct 27, 2009 Short Mountain, TN (east of Murfreesboro), TN tan 70-80 feet away. I saw it 10 seconds before it saw/smelled me. It walked towards me and stopped when it spotted me. It had a very round head, thick legs and torso. We locked gazes for roughly 15 seconds, before I began talking to it. It then took two slow steps back, turned, leapt twice and vanished into the bush. We live in a very wooded area, with many deer and turkey. Drake Gamlin Oct 21, 2009 Springville, TN tanish It was walking on my farm yesterday Draging a deer we killed bow season we have set up bait and trail cameras to try and capture this aimal Cameron Thompson Oct 4, 2009 Jackson, TN Tan I was coming home from a friend house in a community in north Jackson one night this past summer. As I was backing up I saw this large cat in the street, who proceeded to walk into a neighbors yard and sit down watching me in the truck. I thought to myself, that sure is a big bobcat, until I noticed it tail which was long. I when home and goolged Cougars and the face was just like the face of the cat I saw. William Billings Sep 23, 2009 Arlington/eads , TN brown i have seen the cat deer hunting, It ran across the field in front of me. also friend that hunts with me has a photo of the cat captured from a trail cam. this huge cat is draging a nice 8-pt buck. there are cougars in shelby county. i know what i saw and i know what this picture is of. smith Sep 14, 2009 pikeville, TN tan my husband and I had been to pick up our daughter in town. We were on our way back to our home on the mountain. It was around 9:40pm CST that night. We were on a road that we as well as many other people travel every day. We top a steep hill that also starts with a curve.Our head lights hit upon one of the largest cats that we had ever seen. It's tail looked about as long as it's body. It was beautiful. Very graceful. It came across the road and went up a bank into the woods. It did not seem to be scared of my suv at all. I had heard my grand father and great uncle talk of seeing big cats, \"they called them cougars and black panthers\", they said that when they were growing up here in the 1920's and 1930's they had saw several of them in thrie younger and teen years. They wwere both avid hunters and outdoorsman. I just figured that they had been killed out over the years because my father and husband and myself all grew up here and we are outdoors all the time hunting, farming, and fourwheeling, and my father had seen one that a man had killed when he was a young boy. Until this night My husband and I had never saw one. You can not tell me that we don't have them here. The largest cat running free that I had ever saw and I have seen many bob cats over the years have even run over one or two,this was no bob cat.. This cat had a height of a new born baby calf, lengh of about three to three and half feet long not counting the tail. It's paws looked to be as big aroun as a 20oz drink bottle. a marvel of nature, just breath taking.. I just wish that I had had a camera.. Maybe I will get the chance to see another one in my life time. I carry a camera everywhere I go now. Todd Sep 14, 2009 Nolensville, TN Tan My son and I both saw a cougar on 9/14/09 in our back yard in a normal subdivision with lots of trees behind. We were only 20 feet from him. He was not scared and wandered into the more wooded area of the forest. Nicole Lahman Sep 10, 2009 Cordova, TN buff, tan color The cat was at the rear of our property. We have woods behind our property. The cat came up from the woods and was sitting right at our property line. It had a smooth fur face. It had some darker fur areas around the mouth. It was beautiful. It didn't seem extremely large. But, it was larger than a bobcat. We had a bobcat in the same area of our yard about a year ago. It had the spotted fur. Whereas the cat I saw yesterday, had a smooth coat with no spots. It was so cool. It did not look like a typical cat. It's features seem more pronounced and defined. Art Moore Sep 1, 2009 Cleveland, TN gray / brown with white underside I live in a rural area of Bradley county and actually saw this huge majestic cat from inside my house. We have a large window in the kitchen which I keep a set of 10 x 50 binoculars near so I can view the various wildlife that appears. Our fence line is about 450 feet from this window and we have approximate 200 acres undeveloped behind it so we often have deer, foxes and all of the normal Tennessee wildlife. Also, we are about 12 miles from the edge of the National forest.\n\nThis happened around July 12, 2009\n\nIt was about 10:30 a.m. and I was about to get a cup of coffee when I noticed what I thought might be a coyote or a new neighborhood dog sitting on it's hind legs about a foot into the fence line. It was huge. It was grayish brown in color and his belly was almost white... much lighter anyway. It appeared to be the size of my daughter's weimariner dog (about 90 -100 pounds). I grabbed the binoculars and saw it was a big cat. It stayed there around 30 -45 seconds turning it's head almost 180 degrees as it surveyed the valley. My neighbor has several horses and it appeared to be looking at them and them back the other way. It never seemed alarmed or concious of my presence in the window. It then stood and walked to the edge of the brush and then into the bush and was gone. It had a long tail and shorter ears.\n\nMy brother had visited a few months before and arrived around midnight. He said there was a huge cat that jumped from the creek and ran towards the fence line as he came in. I thought no way.\n\nIt was a magnificent creature and a privelege to see...though I think twice about going out without a weapon for any length of time.\n\nAmy Denton-Vinson Aug 25, 2009 Franklin, TN tan with reddish tint-(similar to a deer) 8/25/09\n\nI was driving on Hillsboro Road, headed North, just before reaching Grassland approx 6a.m. on my way to work. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a large \"cat like\" animal to my left in a field approx. 75 yards from the road. The animal was low to the ground, engaged in a stalking stance, as if it had spotted some type of prey. I was completely amazed at what I was witnessing, a very rational person, so I began to question the possibility of could it be a bobcat or coyote?..... knowing full well that this cat was way too big, and had a much different stance. Having grown up on a farm and around avid outdoorsmen all my life, I am very clear that it was not a coyote, a large dog, or a bobcat. (Those were the explanations offered to me after contacting TWRA) I am quite familiar with how those animals appear in the wild. Also, my late father practiced taxidermy as a hobby, and I have seen mounted coyotes and bobcats. This cat WAS NOT either of them. It was approximately 3-4 feet long, large tail, tan with reddish tint to its coat. I was able to pull over quietly, and observe as the cat watched his prey and advanced upon it in a very stealth like manner. I was not aware, or had not ever heard of cougars or any other type of \"big cat\" in the Franklin area, BUT, I am certain of what I saw....... In fact, I am so confident this cat is a threat to surrounding livestock, I stopped the next day to share my experience with the gentleman that owns cattle within close proximity to my sighting. Perhaps \"not a cougar\" according to the few people I have shared my story with, however, I am absolutely positive that the \"big cat\" I saw was definately not one of the above mentioned explanations I was given.
