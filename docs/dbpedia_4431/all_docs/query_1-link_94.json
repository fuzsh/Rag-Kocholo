        "text": "A Driving Force in the Industry\n\nSutton Transport is a leading Midwest trucking company and proud to be family owned for more than 40 years. While we specialize in next-day LTL delivery of palleted freight, we also offer national volume LTL services. We are dedicated to getting freight to its destination in a safe and timely manner. In fact, we boast a combined on-time and intact delivery rate of 98.5%. You’d be hard-pressed to find another trucking company that can match our low freight claim and high on-time percentages!\n\nDelivering the Goods for Clients\n\nIf you’re looking for a regional LTL trucking company in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri or North and South Dakota — or a long-distance shipping company — look no further than Sutton Transport. Do you have special requirements? Are you shipping hazardous materials? Do you need to protect your shipment from freezing? Are you interested in expedited shipping or a guaranteed delivery time? Sutton Transport has your solution!\n\nGoing the Extra Mile for Our Customers\n\n“Thank you for the excellent service you’ve constantly given us this year. You impressed the hell out of the bosses and, outside of some station-to-station moves we do, Sutton Transport is our go-to carrier for WI, IL and MN. Hats off to your staff — communication is excellent, paperwork flows and the freight moves without any issues.”\n\n— Patrick Julian, Domestic Truckload Operations\n\nFueled by 45 Years of Great Service\n\nSutton Transport has been family-owned and operated since its founding in 1979. Starting with a single truck and one terminal, the company now operates 600+ pieces of equipment across thirteen terminals and employs more than 800 hardworking folks on our team. During our 45 years of growth, one thing hasn’t changed: our commitment to exceeding customer expectations. We continue to provide superior service with a personal touch at very competitive prices.\n\nAs we celebrate our 45th year, we're proud to keep the same promise we started with: to go above and beyond for our customers. We've always been about more than just moving freight; we're about offering top-notch service at fair prices, with a personal touch that makes all the difference."
