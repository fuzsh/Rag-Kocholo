        "text": "He’s a “Soul Man” now, but initially, Sam Moore thumbed his nose at the 1967 Sam & Dave smash single, which won a 1968 Grammy.\n\nThe song was written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter, the team who also penned “Hold On! I’m Coming,” “You Got Me Hummin’,” “I Thank You” and “When Something Is Wrong With My Baby,” among other hits in the mid- and late-1960s for the Sam & Dave soul duo, who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nHayes was inspired to write “Soul Man” during the turmoil of the 1960s civil-rights movement, and it became a pride anthem for many African-Americans. Moore, however, was not impressed.\n\n“I didn’t like `Soul Man.’ It didn’t make any sense to me,” Moore says during a recent telephone interview from his Phoenix, Ariz., home. “One of the lyrics said, `I was educated at Woodstock.’ What does that mean? There wasn’t a school at Woodstock.\n\n“I didn’t like message songs,” Moore says.\n\nBut as time went by, the soul singer\n\nre-evaluated his opinion of the song.\n\n“I went back and listened to the words,” says Moore, 72. “It was written following segregation. We were black men. We were soul men. It took me many years to understand that.”\n\nMoore will sing that song Saturday night at the 28th annual Sunset Junction Street Fair in Silver Lake, at the juncture of Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards.\n\nHayes was scheduled to perform, but after the pioneering soul singer’s death Aug. 10, Sunset Junction organizers invited Moore to headline a tribute to Isaac Hayes.\n\nDuring his 60-minute set, Moore will belt out numerous Hayes-written hits from the Sam & Dave catalog, including “Hold On! I’m Coming” and “Soul Man.”\n\nThe festival, which continues Sunday, features three stages of eclectic live music, including Vilma Diaz (the voice of La Sonora Dinamita), Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Cold War Kids, Kinky, Stephanie Mills and a variety of DJs.\n\nThe giant neighborhood party also offers an array of crafts booths, merchandise vendors and ethnic foods.\n\nTickets are $15 in advance, $20 at the gate.\n\nSunset Junction began in 1980 as an attempt to unify neighbors in the hilly, historic district along eastern Sunset Boulevard.\n\nFor many years, Silver Lake had housed a small, quiet gay and lesbian population, but in the 1970s, affordable housing and a Bohemian ambience lured more gays and lesbians as well as gay-owned businesses and bars to the area, and the neighborhood’s gay population grew to more than 20 percent.\n\nAlong the way, tensions grew between the new, higher-income gay whites, and longtime lower-income Latino residents and gangs, who felt the neighborhood had become gentrified. The new gay neighbors also faced increasing verbal harassment, and a heightened anxiety grew in the area.\n\nBut it wasn’t the first time gay residents had been targeted. Sunset Junction was the site of one of the nation’s first gay protests against police harassment.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve 1966, police raided the Black Cat gay bar, and several patrons were injured. On Feb. 11, 1967 – almost 2 1/2 years before the more famous rebellion at the Stonewall Inn in New York’s Greenwich Village – and for several days after, more than 200 people peacefully marched at the Black Cat while heavily armed policed watched them.\n\nIn August 1980, area residents organized a block party to defuse hostilities between Latinos and gays and to celebrate the neighborhood’s diversity.\n\nMichael McKinley, a Beverly Hills hairdresser who moved to Silver Lake in 1980, was one of the organizers, and he reached out to a local gang-intervention group, El Centro Del Pueblo. The group had a pivotal role in helping call a truce among the neighborhood gangs.\n\nMcKinley also hired gays and Latino gang members as security for the event.\n\n“Everybody was always pushing the gangs out, but we included them,” says McKinley, 63. “They liked the power of working security, but didn’t like being around gay people. They did it anyway.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department warned that a bloodbath would happen – and even posted SWAT officers on rooftops along Sunset Boulevard – but the two-day street fair was a peaceful success, with about 30,000 people attending, McKinley says.\n\nOver time, the little block party expanded into the annual neighborhood celebration it is now. As a result, event organizers have been able to book such high-profile musical talent as Beck, Elliot Smith, Chaka Khan, Mary Wilson and Sonic Youth.\n\nMcKinley, director of the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance, the nonprofit group that stages the festival, says the hostilities between the area’s gay and gang populations are less of a problem, but have not been erased.\n\n“People want to think all these problems have gone away, but it hasn’t,” McKinley says. “We try to fool ourselves into thinking it doesn’t exist. Being gay is still the worst thing you can be in this country. Hopefully we are making an impact.”\n\nSunset Junction has grown in popularity – around 200,000 people now attend – but some residents and business owners who have been longtime supporters of the event now are upset.\n\nFences have gone up along Sunset Boulevard to control access to vendor booths and live music performances, and last year, event staff charged a $12 admission instead of accepting donations, which had been the policy for several years.\n\nMcKinley says fences are necessary to control swelling attendance numbers. Meanwhile, staging the event is costly, and in recent years the long-held donation honor system was being ignored.\n\nMusically speaking, Moore says his concert will honor Hayes’ memory.\n\n“I will always be appreciative to the man who put Sam & Dave on the map,” he says. “I do this concert for the memory of the bald-headed one, but I’m sorry I’m doing it this way.”\n\nPhillip Zonkel, (562) 499-1258\n\nphillip.zonkel@presstelegram.com\n\nPREVIEW\n\nSUNSET JUNCTION\n\nSTREET FESTIVAL\n\nWhat: Live entertainment on three stages, games, rides, food and other activities celebrating the cultural diversity of the Sunset Junction area.\n\nWhen: 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWhere: 3700 to 4300 Sunset Boulevard and 4000 to 4200 Santa Monica Boulevard, Silver Lake.\n\nTickets: $15 through www.ticketweb.com or at Tsunami Coffee House, 4019 Sunset Blvd.; $20 at the gate.
