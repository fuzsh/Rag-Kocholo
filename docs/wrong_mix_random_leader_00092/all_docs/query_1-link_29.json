        "text": "Isaac Hayes\n\nIsaac Lee Hayes, Jr. (August 20, 1942 â€“ August 10, 2008) was an American songwriter, musician, singer and actor. Hayes was one of the creative influences behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s. Hayes, Porter, Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, and John Fogerty were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of notable songs for themselves, the duo \"Sam & Dave\", Carla Thomas, and others."
