        "text": "The purpose of The Compass Rose is to raise awareness of Special Collections' resources and to foster the use of these resources. The blog series also reports significant new programs, initiatives, and acquisitions of Special Collections.\n\nThis is the newest in an ongoing series spotlighting new acquisitions and reproductions of our content. For more on our previous featured material, read our previously published Quarterly Review blogs.\n\nSpecial Collections is continually acquiring new materials and image reproductions of items from our collections are regularly used in new publications and by media outlets. This post reviews where and how materials from our collections are being used around the world in April, May, and June of 2024.\n\nThis quarter, Special Collections hosted a total of 922 visitors and 85 of those visitors were here to conduct research in our collections! Over 275 unique archival collections, books, and maps were pulled for research this quarter, with researchers showing strong interest in the Migrant Farmworkers Organizing Committee Records, AFL-CIO Mexican-American Affairs Committee Records, Movin’ Mavs Records, and the Squire Haskins Photography, Inc. Collection.\n\nIn April, Special Collections hosted our most successful event on record when more than 250 people came to our Total Solar Eclipse event on April 8th. We were thrilled to have 230 visitors to our exhibition, Theoria Eclipsium: Curiosity, Captivation, Connection, which shows nearly 500 years of Eclipse-related history. In collaboration with UTA's Department of History, we hosted a talk by Dr. Clifford Cunningham titled \"Total Eclipse of the Heart: How Eclipses Struck Fear and Wonder in the Hearts of People for Thousands of Years\" that was attended by over 125 people. Theoria Eclipsium will remain on view through September 2024.\n\nThe Mavericks with Disabilities student organization hosted a panel discussion, \"Breaking Barriers: Disability Culture Then and Now,\" on April 26 in the library atrium. Panelists included UTA ASL program coordinator Lisalee Egbert and alumni John Dycus (class of 1970) and Cezar Olivas. Olivas was a former Movin' Mavs wheelchair basketball player from 1993-1999 and currently serves as the assistant director of Adapted Sports and Recreation at UTA. Dycus, advocate for accessibility in Arlington since he was a student at UTA in the 1970s, was one of the founding members of Helping Restore Ability (HRA), originally the Arlington Handicapped Association. Dycus also served as Copy & Amusements Editor of The Shorthorn and, after graduating, as adviser for The Shorthorn from 1970-1998. Special Collections displayed materials from the Texas Disability History Collection during the event, which included materials from the UTA Movin' Mavs Records (AR635) and the John Dycus Papers (AR820).\n\nStudents from the \"Latin American Culture and Civilization\" class visited Special Collections multiple times to learn the history of printmaking by studying prints from the 1490s to the present. Examples include our original woodblock prints from the Nuremberg Chronicle all the way up to Etta Hulme's political cartoons. The students returned to view prints from the Vanegas Arroyo print shop – home of the famous José Guadalupe Posada Calaveras prints. In collaboration with the UTA Libraries FabLab, students designed their own prints based on what they had learned."
