        "text": "Presented by the UCLA Film & Television Archive.\n\nPart of the UCLA Film & Television Archive screening series Archive Television Treasures. Learn more at cinema.ucla.edu.\n\nOne of the most beloved television series of the 1970s, The Rockford Files provided the perfect neo-noir showcase for the City of Los Angeles and the wily, megawatt charm of star James Garner. Tailor-suited for Garner’s many gifts as an actor (and expert driver), the character of private detective Jim Rockford represented a timeless non-hero that matched the weariness of the era: a perpetually broke, wrongfully imprisoned ex-con who was both a quick-witted con man and decent to a fault. Produced in association with Garner’s Cherokee Productions, the cliche-busting, Emmy Award-winning series was unique for primetime TV of the ’70s in how it reflected its star’s progressive sensibilities. Throughout its six seasons, The Rockford Files employed diverse talent behind the scenes, with women and people of color integral to the producing, writing and directing of the show (including Meta Rosenberg, Juanita Bartlett, Chas. Floyd Johnson and Ivan Dixon). In front of the camera, Academy Award winners Louis Gossett Jr., Rita Moreno and Isaac Hayes were memorably featured in recurring guest-starring roles.\n\nFollowing his debut lead in the “Blaxploitation” film Truck Turner (1974), Grammy and Academy Award-winning music superstar Isaac Hayes landed the part of Rockford’s prickly, short-tempered former cellmate, Gandolph “Gandy” Fitch. The antagonistic, often hilarious interplay between Garner and Hayes set the framework for three Rockford episodes, including a proposed spin-off co-starring Louis Gossett Jr. and a coda guest-starring top-selling pop and soul legend Dionne Warwick. The Isaac Hayes trilogy exemplifies the best of the series, combining Garner’s indelible portrayal of Rockford and dynamite chemistry with guest stars against a backdrop of the smoggy, sun-drenched streets of 1970s Los Angeles.\n\nTurn on your telephone answering machine and whip a J-turn in your gold Pontiac Firebird to join us in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the premiere of The Rockford Files with a tribute to the neo-noir duo of “Gandy and Rockfish.”\n\nProgram notes by Mark Quigley, John H. Mitchell Television Curator."
