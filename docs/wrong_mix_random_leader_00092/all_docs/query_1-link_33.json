        "text": "Isaac Hayes is a man whose prolific artistry touches many different areas: as an accomplished Grammy, Golden Globe and Academy Award winning composer/musician, published author, in-demand actor and on-air radio personality, Hayesâ illustrious career spans five decades. In 2007, five years after Isaac Hayesâ induction into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame, the public persona of Isaac Hayes is surging forward with a momentum usually associated with teen pop stars and visiting royalty. In fact, Hayes is resident royalty for more than a decade, a coronated King of Ghana in western Africa where Isaac is a member of the Royal Family. Instead of a palace, Isaac built an 8,000 square foot educational facility through his Isaac Hayes Foundation. Isaac Hayes is most certainly the only King on earth with an Oscar, Grammy awards and #1 gold records. Also the voice of âChefâ on the animated TV series South Park, and the author of a best-selling cookbook."
