        "text": "1836 Â· Remember the Alamo\n\nBeing a monumental event in the Texas Revolution, The Battle of the Alamo was a thirteen-day battle at the Alamo Mission near San Antonio. In the early morning of the final battle, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. Quickly being overrun, the Texian Soldiers quickly withdrew inside the building. The battle has often been overshadowed by events from the MexicanâAmerican War, But the Alamo gradually became known as a national battle site and later named an official Texas State Shrine."
