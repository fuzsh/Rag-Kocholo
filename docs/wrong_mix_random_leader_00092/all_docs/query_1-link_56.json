        "text": "? It’s a difficult image to conjure: Isaac Hayes struggling to overcome a nasty case of stage fright.\n\nNot the hippest guy in the room, the epitome of cool.\n\nNot the genius behind the soundtrack for “Shaft.”\n\nNot the voice of Chef on “South Park.”\n\nAnd yet it happened.\n\nIt was in the late ’60s at the Masonic Temple in Detroit. Hayes was making his first live appearance, sharing the bill with the established Staple Singers, and he wasn’t sure how the audience would greet him.\n\n“I had on some hippie-type outfit,” Hayes says. “I had on red, white and blue pants, and moccasins. A purple shirt, and a terrycloth floppy hat. I was dressed weird, you know?”\n\nThen Hayes made a joke, and the audience laughed. He removed the hat, revealing his shaved head, “and the ladies screamed,” Hayes said.\n\nGoodbye, stage fright. Hello, career.\n\nHayes, calling from his home base in Memphis, is reminiscing about his 1969-75 run at Stax Records – a memorable era captured on the new 2-CD collection “Ultimate Isaac Hayes – Can You Dig It?”\n\nThe collection, released Nov. 1, runs the gamut of Hayes’ amazing output at the time, from hits like “Theme from Shaft” to the gospel sounds of “His Eye Is On the Sparrow” to a rarely heard duet with Dionne Warwick.\n\n“Shaft,” with its indelible hi-hat cymbal riff, earned Hayes a pair of Grammys. The soundtrack album stayed on the charts for 60 weeks, and changed the way that movies treated music..\n\nHayes was one of the pioneers in breaking other traditional music business boundaries, whether by mixing his funk with a string section or stretching out on a 12-minute cover of the Warwick hit “Walk on By.”\n\n“I felt what I had to say musically could not be said in two minutes and 30 seconds,” Hayes said. “So I did my thing. If it was a hit, great. But I just did what I wanted creatively.”\n\nThe 63-year-old Hayes was a presence on the musical scene before his debut album, “Presenting Isaac Hayes,” was released in 1969. With partner David Porter, he wrote the hits “Soul Man,” “I Thank You” and “Hold On, I’m Coming” for Sam and Dave. He was in great demand as a session player and producer.\n\nBut it wasn’t until his second solo album, “Hot Buttered Soul,” that the music was given the full Hayes treatment. His earlier songs, Hayes said, were limited by Stax owner Jim Stewart’s “meat and potatoes” approach to recording.\n\nHayes had something different in mind.\n\n“I’d been hearing things in my head for a long time, but I’d been restricted,” Hayes said.\n\nBy the time of his album “To Be Continued,” he was in the studio with violins, trumpets, French horns and flutes. And he became regarded as a brilliant interpreter of other writers’ songs – sort of the Sinatra of soul.\n\nComing up with often outrageous arrangements for music by Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, Al Green and Kris Kristofferson was as rewarding for Hayes as writing his own tunes.\n\n“I like to see how people responded,” Hayes said. “I liked that. It was a big validation.”\n\nThese days, Hayes is keeping himself plenty busy. He’s working on a children’s book, and promoting a cookbook aimed at helping people fight hypertension (the ailment claimed his grandfather, his father and good friend Barry White). And he’s still rolling with the cast from “South Park,” playing school cafeteria kingpin Chef.\n\nHe’s doing a local radio show. And he’s working on a new album – his first since 1995’s dual release, “Branded” and “Raw & Refined” – with veteran drummer Steve Jordan."
