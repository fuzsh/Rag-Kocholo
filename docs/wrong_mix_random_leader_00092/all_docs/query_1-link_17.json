This model not only provides stable, recurring monthly income but also has the potential to turn the next generation of creators into billionaires. For example, a content creator charging $4.99 per month would need just over 16.7 million subscribers to reach billionaire status. With the growing trend of loyal audiences willing to pay for premium content, this path to immense wealth is more attainable than ever. Subscriptions are coming. Fanbase is leading the shift.\n\n$1.7 Million raised and counting! üò± THANK YOU! We‚Äôve just crossed 10% of our total raise goal for this round. ü•≥ Go to fanbase.app/invest to invest right now!

Social apps use your Free content you create and don‚Äôt pay you for, run ads next to it and KEEP THE MONEY. Advertising is 97.5% of Metas revenue. Of course they don‚Äôt want brands paying you directly, they would lose all their revenue. A new world is coming and none of these apps are telling you how to maximize your earning potential from your content. Ask them why. A democratized world of user generated content, equivalent, or even greater and viewership than current network television and streaming services is on the horizon. It‚Äôs already in motion. We‚Äôre leading the conversation. And someone connect me with @therock he‚Äôs a $1.6 Billion Dollar a year TV Network.

I‚Äôm gonna do it differently. I‚Äôm leveraging our collective influence and culture to build a billion dollar company with tens of thousands of owners who all see a positive return on their investment. And then we DO IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. AND AGAIN.\n\nI worked for eveeyhing I got. No rich father, but one of the strongest mothers I know. ‚ô•Ô∏è And I wouldn‚Äôt change any of it cause that adversity made me who I am. So I reminded quiet and stayed in the studio. @jobloentertainment and @shvyeverywhere were there. They were the ones who were giving me rides along with @heatherhayes. You can‚Äôt let what people think, assume or say about you affect you. YOU know your heart, your character, your struggle. God opened so many doors for me I can‚Äôt count. My faith and the work ethic I got from my parents made me tougher than most.
