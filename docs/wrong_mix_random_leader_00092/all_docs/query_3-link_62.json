        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 2008, singer-songwriter Isaac Hayes died at his home in Memphis, Tenn., at the age of 65, due to a stroke. Hayes was one of the creative forces behind the Southern soul-music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a session musician and record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s on several projects. The hit song \"Soul Man,\" written by Hayes and Porter and first performed by Sam & Dave, has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. Hayes is well-known for his musical score for the film Shaft, and his hit song, the \"Theme from Shaft\", won Hayes the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. Later in his career, Hayes also became known as the voice of Chef from the hit cartoon show, South Park.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1963 - Thirteen-year-old Little Stevie Wonder started a three-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Fingertips part II,\" making him the youngest singer to top the charts.\n\n1969 - During a North American tour, Led Zeppelin appeared at the San Diego Sports Arena.

At 17, Marling fits right in.\n\n2012 - Insane Clown Posse takes exception to the FBI naming their fans, collectively known as \"Juggalos,\" as a criminal gang in the FBI's \"2011 National Gang Threat Assessment Report.\" At the annual Gathering of the Juggalos event in Illinois, they announced intentions to sue the FBI.
