        "text": "DATE July 27, 2007 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nFiller: By policy of WHYY, this information is restricted and has\n\nbeen omitted from this transcript\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: David Edelstein of New York Magazine on \"The Simpsons\n\nMovie\"\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\nEighteen years after \"The Simpsons\" made its debut as a weekly half-hour\n\nsitcom, there's finally a feature-length movie. Film critic David Edelstein\n\nhas a review.\n\nMr. DAVID EDELSTEIN: \"The Simpsons Movie\" is longer, more plot driven and\n\nhas more showy animation than an average episode, but it rarely captures the\n\nshow's magic: the lunatic free associations, the madcap highs. Like the\n\n\"SpongeBob SquarePants\" movie, it loses something when it's padded and ironed\n\nout to conform to a standard Hollywood story template.\n\nI'm frankly more of a \"South Park\" than a \"Simpsons\" guy, and yet the\n\nscatological savagery of \"South Park\" would hardly have been possible without\n\n\"The Simpsons.\" The show was a freak TV milestone, its airing the upshot\n\nalmost two decades ago of the fledgling Fox Network's attempt to differentiate\n\nitself from the big three. Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and a writing\n\nteam that boasted a lot of Harvard Lampoon alumni not only changed the way we\n\nsaw primetime cartoons, they changed our notion of TV sitcoms. It turns out,\n\nyou can cram a TV show with TV parodies end-to-end and still find time for a\n\nplot. You can even sass Fox and Republican talking points on Rupert Murdoch's\n\ndime.\n\n\"The Simpsons Movie\" is rooted in the environmental crisis, a fashionable\n\nsubject now but one this show has always been in front on. One of its\n\nearliest and most memorable images was of a three-eyed fish from a polluted\n\nlake, served up to Homer Simpson's boss, that rapacious captain of industry\n\nMr. Burns. And there's a variation of the same gag here. But Burns isn't\n\nthe movie's chief pollutant. It's Homer, who blithely dumps a silo of pig\n\nmanure into an endangered lake and whose selfishness has epic consequences.\n\nSomehow Homer brings about the quarantining and imminent nuking of his home\n\ntown, Springfield. And when the truth comes out, the whole town converges on\n\nhim and Marge and Bart and Lisa and baby Maggie.\n\n(Soundbite \"The Simpsons Movie\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Soundbite of angry voices)\n\nUnidentified Actor #1: (As Marge Simpson) Homer, you have to go out there,\n\nface that mob and apologize for what you did.\n\nUnidentified Actor #2: (As Homer Simpson) I would, but I'm afraid if I open\n\nthe door, they'll take all of you.\n\nUnidentified Actor #3: (As member of mob) No we won't. We just want Homer.\n\nActor #2: (As Homer Simpson) Well, maybe not you, but they'll kill Grandpa.\n\nUnidentified Actor #4: (As member of the mob) I'm part of the mob.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. EDELSTEIN: When the family escapes from the mob and heads for Alaska,\n\nwhere Homer says, `You can't be too fat or too drunk,' the tensions escalate.\n\nHis son, Bart, has already disowned him, preferring the pious ministrations of\n\ntheir next-door neighbor Flanders. Even Homer's loyal wife is on the verge of\n\ngiving him up for his selfishness.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Simpsons Movie\")\n\nUnidentified Actor #1: (As Marge Simpson) I can't believe you'd say something\n\nso selfish.\n\nUnidentified Actor #2: (As Homer Simpson) Marge, those people chased us with\n\npitchforks and torches. Torches! At 4 in the afternoon.\n\nActor #1: (As Marge Simpson) It was 7 at night.\n\nActor #2: (As Homer Simpson) It was during \"Access Hollywood.\"\n\nActor #1: (As Marge Simpson) Which is on at 4 and 7.\n\nActor #2: (As Homer Simpson) D'Oh!\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nMr. EDELSTEIN: It's too bad that, unlike other cartoon protagonists, Homer\n\nhas always bored me silly. The voracious Cartman on \"South Park\" is like a\n\ncharacter out of a Voltaire play, outsized with sleazeball stature. Hank Hill\n\nof \"King of the Hill\" is a befuddled \"everyman\" who's somehow both smaller and\n\nlarger than life. SpongeBob SquarePants is an eternal optimist whose\n\nobliviousness is transcendent. But Homer? Homer remains a boob, a thickie, a\n\nfoil for the appalled Bart, the socially conscious Lisa, and the devoted but\n\nchiding Marge. The dumber Homer is, the more the series--and now the\n\nmovie--comes down to gags and pop culture parodies, jabs at TV, suburban\n\ncluelessness, political chicanery, and the heartlessness of big business and\n\nshow business.\n\nThe gags in the movie, unfortunately, are hit and miss. I like the Tom Hanks\n\ncameo and some Road Runner-esque slapstick. But the writers get surprisingly\n\nlittle mileage out of President Arnold Schwarzenegger and his EPA director Bob\n\nCargill, a blandly resourceful totalitarian lunatic, although the latter is\n\nvoiced with just the right degree of smugness by someone whose credit reads\n\n\"A. Brooks\" and sounds like the dad in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n\nOne joke, though, is so brilliant it made me gasp. When what looks like a\n\nhuge saucer from space hovers over Springfield, the people in a church run\n\nscreaming into the bar next door, while at practically the same instant, the\n\npeople in the bar run screaming into the church. You could write a whole\n\nsociology dissertation on that five-second gag. That's \"The Simpsons\" at its\n\nmost glorious, and here, alas, all too fleeting.\n\nDAVIES: David Edelstein is film critic for New York Magazine.\n\n(Credits)\n\nDAVIES: For Terry Gross, I'm Dave Davies.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Simpsons\")\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nActor #2: (As Homer Simpson) Pizza! Enough saxamophone already.\n\n(Soundbite of music)"
