        "text": "Today’s post was written by David Langbart, archivist in Research Services at the National Archives at College Park, MD.\n\nThe singer and actor Isaac Hayes had a distinctive voice. When he sang or when he spoke, it was unmistakably him. Hayes was a singer, songwriter, composer, and actor. He was a major contributor to the “Memphis Sound” of the 1960s and 1970s. Hayes is perhaps best known for writing and performing the theme song for the motion picture Shaft, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. He is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Younger generations know Hayes as the voice of Chef in the animated series South Park.\n\nIn late November 1976, the U.S. embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, sent a request for information about Hayes and his group to the Department of State. The embassy reported that they might be playing in Khartoum in late December under a program sponsored by the government and a Sudanese official had asked for information. In response, the Department sent the following telegram:\n\nWhile admittedly not at the height of his profession in 1976, the characterization of Hayes in this telegram is off base. Unimaginative? Clearly the author of the telegram had not listened to much Isaac Hayes."
