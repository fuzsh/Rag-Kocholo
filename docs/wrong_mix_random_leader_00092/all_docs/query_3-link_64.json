        "text": "(1942–2008). American singer-songwriter and musician Isaac Hayes helped to popularize soul music, and his recordings influenced the development of such musical genres as disco, rap, and urban-contemporary. He was perhaps best known for his sound track for the 1971 film Shaft; the title song, “Theme from Shaft,” became a chart-topping hit and earned Hayes an Academy award for best original song.\n\nIsaac Lee Hayes, Jr., was born in a shack in Covington, Tenn., on Aug. 20, 1942. While he was an infant, his mother died, and he was raised by his grandparents. Hayes taught himself to play piano and saxophone and in 1964 found work as a studio musician at Memphis-based Stax Records, which produced such notable recording artists as Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, and Otis Redding. While at Stax, Hayes teamed with lyricist David Porter to write a series of soul hits, including Sam and Dave’s “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Comin’.”\n\nHayes recorded his first solo album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, in 1967, but he did not gain wide attention until the release of Hot Buttered Soul in 1969. The idiosyncratic album featured just four songs, one of which was an 18-minute-long version of “By the Time I Get to Phoenix.” The songs included long spoken sections that Hayes described as “rapping.” Hayes became known for his baritone voice and laid-back delivery, as well as for his trademark shaved head and dark sunglasses. Among his other notable albums were Black Moses (1971), Joy (1973), Live at the Sahara Tahoe (1973), and Chocolate Chip (1975).\n\nBy the late 1970s, Hayes had moved into disco music and scored a few hits, such as “Juicy Fruit.” He also acted in several films, including Escape from New York (1981) and I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), a parody of the “blaxploitation” film genre of the 1970s, of which Shaft was a popular example. Hayes earned new fans with his work on the animated television series South Park, for which he provided (1997–2006) the voice of the character Chef. Hayes, a Scientologist, left the show after expressing unhappiness with an episode’s depiction of Scientology.\n\nHayes released two studio albums, Raw and Refined and Branded, in 1995. He published Cooking with Heart & Soul: Making Music in the Kitchen with Family and Friends in 2000. In 2002 Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He died in East Memphis on Aug. 10, 2008."
