        "text": "Isaac Hayes, the pioneering soul singer who died Sunday, is best known to a generation of younger fans not as the composer of the '70s mega-hit \"Theme from Shaft,\" but rather as the voice of Chef, a popular character on \"South Park.\"\n\nHayes angrily quit the show in 2006, however, after an episode that mocked his religion -- Scientology. \"There is a place in this world for satire,\" he said at the time, \"but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins.\" A co-creator of the show, Matt Stone, shot back that Hayes never minded when the show made fun of other faiths. Hayes. he said, \"'has no problem -- and he's cashed plenty of checks -- with our show making fun of Christians.''"
