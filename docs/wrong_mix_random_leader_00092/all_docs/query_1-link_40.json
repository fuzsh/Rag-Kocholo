It was a deliberately constructed and successful Black political and economic ecosystem achieved through the Democratic process of voting for Democrats. \n\nI say this to say that “The Democrats” are who WE elect into power. Not a group of people that we assume have our best interests in mind. We choose who we want in power. \n\nSo I fully understand the lack of faith in both parties depending on where you live. \n\nBut I can unequivocally that Democrat policies and agendas have been more aligned with the Black community than the other party. \n\nSo it’s not the Democratic Party you have issue with it’s the power you have to implement your agenda in the party. \n\nAnd that I can say is heavily dependent on where you live and your population numbers. \n\nI think all black communities around America should examine the Democratic Party of Atlanta, Georgia, and the civil rights leaders that took power and gave it to the people.\".",
