        "text": "PRIMARY WAVE MUSIC PARTNERS WITH THE ESTATE OF THE\n\nLEGENDARY ISAAC HAYES\n\nTHE DEAL WILL SEE THE DYNAMIC PUBLISHER ADMINISTER VARIOUS PUBLISHING INTERESTS OF THE AWARD-WINNING SINGER’S ESTATE, AS WELL AS MARKET THIS NAME, IMAGE, AND LIKENESS\n\nNEW YORK, NY (October 5, 2023) – Primary Wave Music, the leading independent publisher of iconic and legendary music in the world, announces today their partnership with the estate of the legendary singer, actor, songwriter, and composer Isaac Hayes. Terms of the deal will see Primary Wave administer various publishing interests of the award-winner’s estate. In addition, the partnership will grant the dynamic publisher the opportunity to market Isaac’s name, image, and likeness.\n\nAcross his nearly six-decade career, Isaac Hayes was songwriter, producer and/or musician to some of the most iconic songs in the history of music. His incomparable career produced songs such as “Soul Man” which was named one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, the number one hit and platinum single “Hold On, I’m Coming,” and so many others.\n\nHayes released over 20 albums over the course of his critically acclaimed career in music. His sophomore effort, Hot Buttered Soul, is what many claim to be his landmark album and what put him on the map as a singer. The album shot to number 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B chart and went to number 8 on the Top 200. The songs from this album and his entire discography still resonate today. In 2019, the New Yorker raved “Fifty years ago last summer, he released one of the most extravagantly beautiful musical manifestos of the modern era, Hot Buttered Soul. The forty-five-minute album, consisting of just four extended psychedelic-orchestral tracks, changed not only the sound of soul but also its scale.”\n\nOf the deal, Isaac Hayes III said, “Myself, and the entire Hayes family, are enthusiastically optimistic as we embark on this amazing partnership with Primary Wave. This venture isn’t just a business endeavor, it’s a fusion of passion and legacy. It’s an honor to align with a powerhouse that reverberates with innovation, authenticity, and remarkable foresight. Together, we’re not just creating notes, but orchestrating the future of a timeless, Black American icon, ensuring that the soul, influence, and genius of Isaac Hayes is forever celebrated and revered.”\n\nPrimary Wave Music’s Chief Operating Officer, Ramon Villa adds, “We thank the Hayes family for entrusting us as a partner to continue the great work they have done to uplift the legacy and artistry of Isaac Hayes. He has always been and will always be the epitome of “cool” and truly his music just makes one feel good. Welcome to the Primary Wave family, Mr. Hayes. We look forward to helping expand the reach of your magic.”\n\nTerms of the deal will also give the estate access to Primary Wave’s marketing team and publishing infrastructure, which includes digital strategy, licensing, synch opportunities, and film & TV production.\n\nIsaac Hayes was an American singer, actor, songwriter, and composer. He was one of the creative forces behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a session musician and record producer during the mid-1960s. Hayes’ songwriting catalog consists of iconic hits like “Hold On I’m Coming”, and “Soul Man” which he co-wrote and produced for Stax duo, Sam and Dave.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Hayes embarked on a solo career in which he would forever change the sound and style of R&B and soul music. His blending of gritty guitars, drums and bass fused with beautiful string, horn and woodwind orchestral arrangements would create what the world knows as “symphonic soul”. His breakout album Hot Buttered Soul released in (1969) would reimagine the pop song “Walk on By” by Dionne Warwick into a 12-minute masterpiece.\n\nIn addition to his solo career, he served as composer for the film Shaft (1971). The “Theme from Shaft”, Isaac won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. This made him the third black person to win an Academy Award ever.\n\nHayes also won two Grammy Awards for that same year in total making him a 3-time Grammy Winner.\n\nAs the era of Hip-Hop began to take shape in the late 80’s, Isaac Hayes’ music would serve as one of the foundational cornerstones of sampling. His music was sampled and turned into classic Hip-Hop hits by rap icons Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., Snoop Dogg, WuTang Clan and countless others.\n\nHayes continues to be one of the most sampled artists of all time.\n\nIn 1997 Hayes was part of the founding cast of Comedy Central’s animated TV series South Park. He provided the voice for the character of “Chef”, the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef combined his work both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character’s penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. A song from the series performed by Chef, “Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)”, received international radio airplay in 1999. It reached number one on the UK singles chart and also on the Irish singles chart. The track also appeared on the album Chef Aid: The South Park Album in 1998\n\nIn 2002, Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIsaac Hayes’ influence on music, fashion, style, and black masculinity are still felt today and continue to solidify his legacy as an American icon of entertainment and the personification of “Cool”."
