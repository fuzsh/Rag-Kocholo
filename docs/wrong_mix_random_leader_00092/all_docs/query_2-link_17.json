He had solid production against older competition. And he was able to play his game. He got his 3pt shot off quickly and efficiently 2-4 vs Triumph and 3 vs Trae Young. He was able to get past guards and get paint touches where he found teammates on the wing or finished at the basket or with floaters. He told me personally he wanted to prove he could play against top 16u talent."
