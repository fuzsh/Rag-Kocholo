        "text": "Welcome! As a sizable number of you folks come here because at the moment I’m the only sucker who has spent an evening transcribing the rap at the beginning of this great track, I thought I’d give you what you want in an easily accessibly format. If you dig it, click here to read my review of Isaac Hayes Movement, you’ll like it*.\n\nPardon me. Can I have a word with you for a few minutes? Sit down, get comfortable. Uhhh, how long have we known each other? About 10 months? Yeah I think its, yeah. You and John are real tight aren’t ya? Yeah. Oh is that an engagement ring? Awww, congratulations. Oh he slipped it on your finger last night huh? He’s the luckiest man in the world, you know, he should be real proud to have someone like you. Oh yeah, umm, what I wanted to talk to you about is, well, there is something that has been bugging me for about 5 months and I’ve been carrying it around with me and it’s getting heavier and heavier everyday…And, uh, yeah it’s almost to the boiling point and I have to get it off my chest. Yeah, I’m not trying to be fresh or anything, because I know your John’s girl, but I just have to tell you this. You see I have a great deal of respect for you…I’m not being, you know, not going left field on you …but dig.\n\nYou see I’m gonna take you back to my childhood for a minute….We had quite a big family and we weren’t very rich, sometimes we lived from day-to-day. But one thing we did do was go to church every Sunday. Mama took us to church, and I was in the choir too, hey yeah I sang a little bit in Sunday school. She taught us the golden rules, the 10 commandments, and she said, “Son do onto others as you have them do onto you”, she said “Don’t steal” “Don’t rob” You know all the things good parents try to instil into their children. Well you know I did a few little things like shoot hook, I guess every kid shoots hooky at least once. And umm, she said “Stay out of trouble” You know when I was a teenager I didn’t break in, burglarize, or rob anybody. I tried to work for what I got, you know, tried to be honest. Didn’t commit no crimes or nothing, but you know I had to wait, huh ’til I reached manhood to commit a crime, according to the court of love, if there is such a court. But you know….sometimes you’re forced into things like this, see sometimes Cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can’t get out the way, you know? And you can fall and the more you, it’s like being in quicksand too, the more you wiggle the deeper you sink.\n\nI’m not gonna take up too much of your time, you see I’m not very good with words and I had to tell you all of that, so I can really say what I got to say. See there is a lot of talk going around town that I’m on the make for John’s girl, “Ike’s on the make for John’s girl”. I don’t mean to do anybody wrong because I wouldn’t want anybody to bother anything that belongs to me. But you see I’ve never seen anybody like you, I’ve never known anybody like you, and there’s some things you just can’t help. At night I toss and turn, I try to keep it out my mind but you see….I find myself thinking about you. I just can’t help it, and right now……\n\n(cue song)\n\n*in a recent vote in my household I was voted the world’s greatest living writer. True story."
