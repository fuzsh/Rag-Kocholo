        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 2008, singer-songwriter Isaac Hayes died at his home in Memphis, Tenn., at the age of 65, due to a stroke. Hayes was one of the creative forces behind the Southern soul-music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a session musician and record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s on several projects. The hit song \"Soul Man,\" written by Hayes and Porter and first performed by Sam & Dave, has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. Hayes is well-known for his musical score for the film Shaft, and his hit song, the \"Theme from Shaft\", won Hayes the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. Later in his career, Hayes also became known as the voice of Chef from the hit cartoon show, South Park.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1959 - Four members of the Platters were arrested following a gig in Cincinnati after being found with four 19-year-old women in various stages of undress. The scandal resulted in radio stations across the U.S. removing Platters records from their playlists.\n\n1963 - Thirteen-year-old Little Stevie Wonder started a three-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Fingertips part II,\" making him the youngest singer to top the charts.\n\n1974 - John Denver went to No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Back Home Again.\n\n1974 - Roberta Flack went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" her third U.S. No. 1.\n\n1976 - Elton John begins a historic record-breaking ten-night run of concerts at New York City's Madison Square Garden.\n\n1985 - Canadian singer and guitarist Bryan Adams scored his first U.S. No.1 album with Reckless.\n\n1985 - Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran was air-lifted to safety when his boat, Drum, overturned while racing off the English coast.

Despite this, the FBI continues to list Juggalos as an organized gang in later years.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nClarence Leonidas 'Leo' Fender, inventor and founder of the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, was born today in 1909.\n\nBobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers was born today in 1940.\n\nJames Griffin of Bread was born today in 1943.\n\nVeronica Yvette Bennett, also known as Ronnie Spector, is 76.
