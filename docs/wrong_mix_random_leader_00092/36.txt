Isaac Hayes was an American singer-songwriter, musician, actor, and producer, and began his career as a songwriter for Stax Records, writing hit songs for other artists such as Sam & Dave and Otis Redding. In the late 1960s, Hayes began to release his own albums, which featured his soulful and innovative blend of R&B, funk, and jazz. His most famous album, "Hot Buttered Soul," was released in 1969 and included his epic 18-minute rendition of "By the Time I Get to Phoenix." He also wrote the score for the 1971 blaxploitation film "Shaft," which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Hayes continued to record music throughout the 1970s and 1980s and also appeared in a number of films and television shows.
