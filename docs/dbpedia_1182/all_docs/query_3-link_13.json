It reached #15 on the iTunes pop charts in the week of release and received praise from PopMatters and support from Glamour. VH1 called it \"at once classic and contemporary, a mix of glam rock and classical music in just the right measures\" and The New Yorker described it as \"a richly orchestrated pop album\".\n\nIn March 2011 and 2013, Charlene played at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas.\n\nCharlene was involved in the Miracle Musical album Hawaii: Part II, the side project of Tally Hall member Joe Hawley, which released on December 12, 2012.\n\nCharlene wrote and provided vocals for the eighth song in the album Hawaii: Part II.
