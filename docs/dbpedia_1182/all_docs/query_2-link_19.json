        "text": "SLAVE TO PROPHESIES INTRODUCING THE LYRICAL GENIUS: “GROUND ATTACK9”! AN ASPIRING, AS WELL AS VERY INSPIRING HIP HOP ARTIST. FOR WE ARE NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE UNDERGROUND’S HOTTEST EMCEES, BUT MOST LIKELY YOUR FAVORITE RAPPERS GHOST WRITER. “GROUND ARTACK9” IS A ARTIST, SO COMPLEX & CONTROVERSIAL WITH THE HOTTEST & EDGYEST SUBJECT MATTERS, THAT ACTUALLY RAISES HIS STATUS TO OFF THE TOP OF CHART LEVELS. GHOST WRITING FOR BITERS LIKE JADAKISS, J COLE, & AND THEIR SLAVE MASTER EMINEM…THIS LYRICAL PHENOM HAS EXPLODED ONTO THE CIRCUIT WITH SOME OF 2023’s HOTTEST SINGLES TO DATE. SINGLES LIKE.. “3/5ths Of A Man 2/5ths Of The Amazement”, “BLACK GENIUS”, “ULTIMATE LIBERATION”, WITH MANY MORE. BUT HE IS BACK WITH HIS MOST CURRENT SINGLE: “SLAVE TO PROPHESIES”. AND IF YOU DONT FIND THIS DOPE MAKING YOU NOD OUT, ITS ONLY BECAUSE YOU’BE MADE A MISTAKE THINKING IT WAS COCAIN. AND IF YOU THINK ALL OF THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU MAKES “GROUND ATTACK9” STAND OUT, HEAD & SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST, THINK AGAIN. AND YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK BIGGER THAN HIP HOP. FOR, WHATEVER A TRUE EMCEE PUTS OUT ON TOP OF HIS CANVAS, YOU CAN MOST LIKELY BELIEVE HES LIVING IT OUT. A LIFESTYLE, IN CONNECTION TO SOME OF THE HOTTEST METAPHORS DEADLY WORD PLAY…AND A CREATIVE ABILITY THAT IS THROUGH THE ROOF! AND ITS ALL BASED IN A CONSPIRACY THAT RUNS FAR & WIDE. YET NONE OF “GROUND ATTACK9’s” OPPOSITION, FEDS OR LOCAL POLICE CAN GET THEIR COONZ TO CONTAIN “GROUND ATTACK9”. THEREFORE, YOU WILL FIND THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER & WAY OF LIFE THAT “GROUND ATTACK9” HAS CHOSEN TO EMBRACE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, LOCAL POLICE & AND THEIR HOST KNOWN AS “SATANS ARMY” HAS CHOSEN TO PLACE “GROUND ATTACK9” ON THE “BLACK WATCH LIST”. BUT “GROUND ATTACK9” SEEMS SO ELUSIVE VIA THE WORLD OF THE PERFORMING ARTS. FOR, WHENEVER GOD BLESSES HIS SERVANT WITH THE ARSENAL, THAT “GROUND ATTACK9” HAS, IT BECOMES MORE THAN A MOVEMENT. IT BECOMES A RUN-AWAY TRAIN, WITH NO BREAKS. AND POWER BECOMES IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE. CO CLICK DOWN BELOW. AND CATCH THAT “GROUND ATTACK9” EXPERIENCE. AND IF YOU DON’T REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE, YOU WILL REMEMBER HIS NAME. GO AHEAD. CAUSE YOU KNOW THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO:) https://lnkd.in/dzXWyWYF https://lnkd.in/d9azGJFW\n\nAirbnb's new release \"Icons\" is a game-changer. It goes beyond just listing and booking accommodations to build a strong brand image in the minds of users. This is similar to a project I worked on at LinkedIn 18 months ago called \"Job Exploration,\" which aimed to use the best, most exclusive, and culturally valuable assets to shape long-term brand perception. While that project was unfortunately discontinued due to the closure of LinkedIn's product and engineering offices in China, I still have fond memories of it. I wish Airbnb's new product all the best. It's a great inspiration for product people who care about more than just commercial value, CTR, and DAU, but also about values, ethics, and aesthetics. ou can still catch a glimpse of JE's essence： https://lnkd.in/e7gwVEAg"
