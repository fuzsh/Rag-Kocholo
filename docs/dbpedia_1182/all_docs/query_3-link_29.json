        "text": "Enjoy a Free First Lesson: Register today with this teacher and your first 30-minute lesson is free. No strings attachedâ€”you can walk away with a full refund for all fees after the first lesson.\n\nThis Does Not Mean There Will Be No Charges: To ensure safety and validate identities, we require credit card information before releasing teacher details. On the day of your first lesson, you'll be charged for 2 lessons plus a registration fee, with the first lesson credited. Refunds will be processed as quickly as possible but may take up to 3-4 days to show on your statement.\n\nCancellation Policy: Cancel after your first lesson and receive a full refund, including the registration fee, within 3 business days. Please cancel at least 24 hours before the second lesson to avoid being charged for it.\n\nPromotion Abuse:\n\nClients may have no more than one free lesson from any teacher ever. They must be a new client to that teacher and may have no more than two free lessons within the last 18 months across the entire BAH network.\n\nEligibility is at the sole discretion of BAH and can be revoked for any reason.\n\nThis promotion is for new business only. Attempts to use the policy to save money by cancelling and rebooking, or frequently booking with different teachers will be rejected. Any and all forms of manipulation of the policy will be billed by Beethoven at Home at full price with full compensation to the teacher offering the promotion.\n\nClient-Friendly Terms: Cancel any lesson with 24 hours' notice for a credit. After the third lesson, a 2-lesson notice period is required for termination. Post initial charge, billing occurs on the 1st of each month, with a preview sent 3 days prior. Refundable changes after billing apply as credits to the next month.\n\nBAH is proud of our impeccable reputation. Clear terms upfront help us maintain this tradition.\n\nCheers,\n\nBeethoven at Home - Customer Support"
