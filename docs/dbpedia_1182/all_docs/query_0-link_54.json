Hawthorn was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. In the late summer after she graduated from Beaumont High School, she was employed by Lamar State College. Her jobs ranged from relief secretary for a vacationing employee to switch board operator. During her freshman year, she was student assistant to Lamar President F.L. McDonald. She was assistant to O.B. Archer, Vice President for Alumnae Affairs, for the remainder of her undergraduate years.\n\nWhile Norma was a freshman, she went through formal rush and pledged Alpha Chi Omega. Although 5 of her classmates from high school were in her pledge class, the majority of young women in the chapter were unknown to her. Several chapter members, regardless of college classification or hometown, became lifelong friends.\n\nDuring her college years Norma not only was employed by Lamar and was an active member of her sorority, but she was also on the Lamar yearbook staff and served as Editor in Chief.\n\nAfter graduation Norma taught briefly in Hamshire-Fannett and then attended graduate school at the University of Texas in Austin. She taught school in Austin and then in Houston before marrying Lum in 1967.\n\nDuring the first 2 years of their marriage, Norma and Lum lived in Philadelphia and Chicago. After their return to Beaumont, in 1969 Norma began an active membership in the Alpha Chi Omega Alumnae Chapter. She held the positions of President, Treasurer and served for 30 years as Chapter Advisor at Lamar. Her position as Chapter Advisor gave Norma the opportunity to work with collegiate at Lamar as well as alumnae form other areas. One of her favorite activities as Chapter Advisor was traveling to other areas in the state and in the U.S. for state and/or national conventions. Had Norma not attended Lamar, she would not have had the opportunities to meet and befriend so many women from a variety of fields.\n\nThrough her own experience while a student at Lamar and a sorority member and through her experience as Chapter Advisor, Norma understands the financial difficulties many young women at Lamar face in being a member of a sorority and paying tuition. She feels fortunate to be able to assist in meeting some of those financial needs by making this contribution to the endowed Alpha Chi Omega Scholarship that was established in her name to honor her.\n\nAlpha Tau Omega Alumni Association Memorial Scholarship (ATO)\n\n\"The Zeta Theta chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity was founded at Lamar University in 1957 by Elvis L. Mason, who in later years was presented with the Lamar University Distinguished Alumnus Award. The ATO chapter was active on campus for 53 years until the charter was pulled in 2010. At that time, the Alpha Tau Omega Alumni Association established the beginnings of a new and much improved Zeta Theta chapter, which was re-chartered in the fall of 2015. With the help of the ATO Alumni Association, the chapter has grown into the most dominant fraternity on the Lamar campus today. The chapter is made up of young men that understand the importance of leadership, philanthropy and brotherhood.\n\nThe Alumni Association of the Zeta Theta Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity is proud to fund an endowed scholarship in the name of two of our brothers that we miss every day, James \"\"JK--Jimmy\"\" Kimmey (Kinesiology, 1986) and William \"\"Pete\"\" Elliott (1974 Alumnus). The annually budgeted award will be divided equally between the fall and spring semesters. The fall semester scholarship will be known as the _James Frederick Kimmey Memorial Award_ and the spring semester will be known as the _Pete Elliott Memorial Award_.\n\nThe recipients must be active and initiated members of the Lamar University Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and be in good standing with the University and both the fraternity's Lamar and national chapters. The scholarship is open to all majors and class levels. Recipients must be enrolled full-time and maintain a 3.0 GPA.\"\n\nAlzena and Bernard Bell Memorial Scholarship\n\nAlzena (Baker) and Bernard Bell met in Beaumont, Texas and married in 1951. After serving his country as an Army Staff Sargent in World War II, Bernard was a laborer for most of his working life. Alzena was a dedicated and inspirational mother and homemaker. Though neither had the opportunity to attend college, both understood the critical role that higher education plays in improving the lives of the underprivileged. Alzena and Bernard worked hard every day of their lives to ensure that their unfulfilled dreams of going to college could become a reality for their three children. Their daughter, Veronica, and sons, Ray and Ofay, all attended Lamar University. Ofay earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Technology. Veronica graduated from Syracuse University with a dual degree in Political Science and Communications and took summer classes at Lamar to help her get her Bachelor of Arts degree in three years. Ray attended Lamar in Fall 1977 and Spring 1978. Veronica, Ray, and Ofay established the Alzena and Bernard Bell Memorial Scholarship in 2019 to honor their parents’ legacy and to help future generations of disadvantaged students achieve their dream of obtaining a college degree.\n\nAmanda Garcia Guevara Annually Funded Memorial Scholarship\n\nThe Amanda Garcia Guevara Annually Funded Memorial Scholarship was established by Mrs. Naomi Hill in remembrance of her sister, Amanda Garcia Guevara.

We heard her stories of inspiration about what we could be as adults through education, \"you can be anything you want, so long as you have an education.\" Later, as young adults, we heard her philosophy about education providing an optimal opportunity for growth and success, \"Education levels the playing field.\"\n\nWe were required to perform well in our school studies. My mother monitored our progress and ensured that we did our assigned homework. She was an active member of the Parent-Teacher Association. The principal of the school often joked with my mother that she should be an emeritus member for life having served in the association for many years.\n\nIf we were not in school, we were enrolled in swimming lessons, summer school, religious education school, piano lessons, music lessons, dance lessons, attending Cub Scouts meetings, Boy Scouts meetings, Bluebirds meetings, Camp Fire Girls meetings, traveling to see the wonders of the Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, and of course, Disneyland, or going to the library, not because we did not have an extensive library, but because we wanted to experience the facility. We were required to perform chores and work at my father's pharmacy during summers and on holidays.\n\nAs an avid reader, my mother encouraged each of us to read and ensured that our house was filled with many books. She instilled a love for music as she would devote Sunday afternoons after Sunday morning church and formal dinner to read in the den filled with so many books with wondrous pictures and stories. While our house was filled with classical music or opera during the day, the night was filled with jazz or Spanish music that our father liked and listened to as he relaxed after a long day of work.\n\nThere are seven (7) children of Alfredo T. Garcia, Jr. and Anita Sylvia Flores Garcia. I wonder, in retrospect, how my parents coped with seven strong-willed, highly active, and often times mischievous children.\n\nWe have been blessed in many ways. Professionally, the Garcia children consist of a cardiologist, medical doctor, reading specialist in education, lawyer, prosthodontist, math specialist in education, and a certified public accountant. As equally important, each member of the Garcia children participates in public service through involvement in church, professional associations, and civic boards.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that our mother made it her mission that each of us should have every advantage that life had to offer and she believed that such could only be achieved through education.\n\nMy mother sacrificed her dreams of becoming a nurse to devote all of her time and energy not only to the marriage, but to each of us.\n\nWith much sacrifice and great attention to our individuality, my mother instilled in each of us a love of God, family, country, and love of neighbor.\n\nHaving been raised in Kingsville, Texas at a time when discrimination and prejudice were the norm, my mother was forbidden to speak Spanish, and was placed in the back row of her classroom because she was of Mexican ethnicity and spoke Spanish as her primary language. She was given the option to immediately immerse herself in the English language or be held back. She, too, was strong-willed. She quickly learned English and adapted to the system, but she did not yield her dignity to such abhorrent practices of indignities. When she entered her last year of high school, she enrolled in a class that she needed to meet the minimum requirements for graduation. When she entered the classroom, she sat at a desk in the front row. The teacher demanded that she remove herself from that desk, and told her that she could not sit there and that she had to sit in the back row. My mother got up from the desk and without uttering a word, in response, left the classroom with the teacher following her demanding that she return to the classroom. Later, her father was summoned to the school to discuss my mother's behavior. Her father appeared at the meeting with my mother and when confronted about her rebellion, that is, leaving the classroom without permission, her father looked at the school principal and told him that she was right to have left the classroom and that his daughter did not have to suffer the indignity of the ignorance displayed by the teacher. He demanded that my mother be permitted to withdraw from the class. Her father protected her and preserved her dignity as well as his in registering disgust over an institutional culture that allowed such conduct. Later, my mother enrolled in the required course with a different instructor and then qualified to receive her high school diploma I did not learn of such an experience until many years later after I completed my law degree.\n\nWhen I asked her why she did not share her story of prejudice and discrimination with me when I was younger, she explained that she did not want me to feel or experience her indignity for fear of indoctrination a predisposition of hate or anger toward those who practiced such conduct. She explained her eternal hope for the betterment of relationships among all cultures and races and that such could not be achieved by instilling anger or hatred about past practices.\n\nMy mother later attended schools after completing high school and enrolled in courses whole she discerned her future. When she decided that she wanted to be a nurse, she enrolled a Lamar University, at the time called Lamar Junior College, with the intention of completing her studies in nursing. She met my father who fell in love with her, and after much courtship, married. She did not finish her studies, which she regretted. I surmise that such was the impetus that each of her children would not be allowed to stray from her indoctrination, that each of us had to seek higher education. She had an abundance of ambition for each of us as she helped us dream and we understood and felt that completing high school was only the beginning of the journey. Through each of her children, my mother experienced her dreams of graduating from college many times, albeit vicariously.\n\nOur family has honored our father with an endowment at the University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy. As a pharmacist and sole proprietor of a pharmacy store in Alice, Texas, he worked hard to enable each of us to achieve our dreams. Our father was a great believer in education. His mother was a teacher. He was equally ambitious for each of us to be exemplary in our lives and school.\n\nAnn & Paul Pigue Endowment in Engineering\n\nThe Ann & Paul Pigue Endowment in Engineering was established to provide funds for scholarships, faculty enhancement, to support research and new programs and any other needs of the College of Engineering as determined by the Dean of the College.

Not in that cliché way that everyone who passes a little too soon is often described but in that real, holy smokes, “you will never meet another person like him: kind of way. Chase lived for his family and the friends that were the family he chose. He was hilarious, kind, vivacious, and so much fun. Chase was often the last man standing at the end of the night and always the first man to stand up when someone needed help.\n\nHe was laid back from day one, happy and filled with joy. Days spend on the baseball or soccer fields, or out hunting and fishing were great days in his book. Throughout high school, many family weekends consisted of traveling with select teams and forming friendships that lasted a lifetime.\n\nChase graduated from Westbrook High School in 2012 and then began his college journey. He obtained his Instrumentation degree from LIT and continued pursing his bachelor’s at Lamar University. While attending Lamar, he was initiated into the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He immediately found a second home and became a leader to his brothers. Within this brotherhood, bonds were created that impacted Chase’s short life profoundly. His impact on his brothers will continue throughout generations.\n\nChase had just begun a career as a Process Operator at Chevron Phillips. He loved his job and the people he worked with. His outlook was bright, and he was even beginning to talk about purchasing his first home.\n\nChase’s charismatic personality was most infectious. He had a smile as bright as his red hair and was the epitome of the term, “Spitfire”. He was a real jokester with a heart of pure gold. To know him was to love him and to be his friend was to love him even more. He leaves a legacy as the life of the party and the one that always reminded those close to him to never let life get in the way of spending time with the people you love.\n\nCheer Team Scholarship\n\nCheer team tuition scholarship.
