        "text": "It is important to acknowledge the reality and impact of the student’s feelings and to understand racism and its effect on minority students in our classrooms, and in their day-to-day living.\n\nBut first, I recommend that anyone who plans to teach take some time for reflection on their own personal history, and the impact that being raised in a white supremist society has on their daily actions. We all like to think of ourselves as good, fair, educated individuals, and it can be difficult to acknowledge our own participation in a racist society. We must acknowledge that being white means we have racial biases which we cannot see.\n\nAs for myself, I am a white woman who was raised in the south in the 1970s. School zones were still gerrymandered due to the efforts of segregationist politicians. The year I started kindergarten, my all-white public elementary school hired a Black kindergarten teacher. Then a few years later, the school zones were finally restructured, and our schools were ever-so-slowly integrated. I made my first black friends, and for decades, I felt this meant I was not racist.\n\nMy own experiences with minority students who struggled or did not choose to participate in class led me on a journey which called my own biases into question, which more recently led me to read Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility. I recommend that anyone who wishes to teach read this book. It is a great jumping-off point to understanding the history of racism in the United States, understanding one’s own racial biases – intended or not, and learning what to do about it. We must acknowledge that racism exists, and that the challenges and frustrations faced by minority students are real, if we are to help them to become more comfortable and successful in our classrooms. We must also confront our own complicity in a racist framework.\n\nBy the time a Black student arrives in an undergraduate classroom in the United States, it is likely they have endured eighteen or so years of racist behavior. They may have been born in a less-equipped hospital than white students, were possibly raised in a neighborhood that was deemed undesirable or unsafe by whites, very probably discouraged from taking honors or Advanced Placement classes in school, and deemed more likely to be volatile or temperamental by school officials and police. Other minority students face stereotypes too. They may arrive at your classroom expecting you to judge them according to prevailing racial stereotypes, and to mistrust them, not look them in the eye, and avoid calling on them in class discussions. Please make an intentional effort to include them.\n\nOften, when BIPOC students speak out about inequality, they are told they are being difficult. When they struggle in a class, they are told they “just need to apply themselves,” and based on my own conversations with students of color, are less likely to be given time and individual help outside of class.\n\nIt is no wonder these students often do not participate in social activities with white students, preferring instead to socialize with “their own”.\n\nA recent experience reminded me that it is my job to make sure my BIPOC students know they can trust me, by being more open, clear, and active about my views on racism, and in the fight against systemic white supremacy.\n\nOne afternoon, after an individual singing assessment, I told a Black student that I had learned from his applied teacher that he had not attended a social gathering for the (otherwise all white) studio held at the instructor’s home. I asked him why.\n\n“Well, it’s complicated, you know. Those aren’t my people.”\n\n“What do you mean they’re not your people?”\n\n“It’s just – this is hard to talk about . . .”\n\n(Of course it was hard. Why would he trust me, a white woman, with this information? White women have a history of getting Black men in trouble, and I had not made my views on racism known to him.)\n\nSensing the student was weighing whether to discuss a racial issue openly with me, I said, “Yeah, we’re pretty white here, aren’t we?”\n\n“Yeah! I mean, I came from (a predominantly Black school for the arts)! I grew up in an all Black neighborhood. I’m just not used to . . .”\n\n“Oh, I hear that. Do you have other people you do socialize with? Friends outside the studio?”\n\n“Yeah. I mean, the guys on the (sports) team, they’re my people. They’re my friends. That’s who I hang with. I’m just more comfortable with them.”\n\n“That’s fine. I’m glad you have people you feel comfortable being around. That’s important. But I worry that you missed a studio event because you felt uncomfortable, and I worry that not attending events like this will cause you to be shut out of certain opportunities.”\n\n“Well, look, I’m a scholarship student. My background is not the same as theirs.”\n\n“But you are a scholarship student because you’re a good player and an outstanding athlete. (The student was on a combination performance/athletics scholarship.) You got those scholarships because you deserve them. You stood out!”\n\n“But I don’t know if I really belong here.”\n\n“You do belong here, or you would not have been offered those scholarships. Take your place.”\n\nThere was a look of relief on the student’s face at these words. It is amazing how far being seen will go to help a student feel more comfortable in a classroom. I have to admit that, given my miseducation on racism up to that point, this was an uncomfortable conversation for me to navigate, but it was even more uncomfortable for my student. I could have avoided this discomfort, for myself but more importantly for the student, by making my stance against racism and white supremacy clear at the beginning of the semester, and by reinforcing this in the syllabus, and in my interactions with students.\n\nI do not regret talking candidly with this student about race and his feeling of not belonging. From that point forward, he was much more open with me, I felt and saw his defensive “walls” come down. He sat closer to the front of my classroom. When he was injured playing his sport, I pulled him aside and asked if he was being treated fairly by the team and receiving appropriate medical care. (He said he was.) This student began sending me occasional detailed updates on his injury and process of recovery. Meanwhile his transcription self-assessments became more clear and introspective, as well as full of sports analogies! When a self-initiated student recording project he was heading began to flounder, he came to me to ask this question, “Why do white people commit so enthusiastically to projects and then not follow through? Where I’m from, if we don’t follow through, there are consequences. I have never had the privilege of not following through.” He wasn’t expecting me to have the answers. He just wanted someone he could openly talk to.\n\nIt absolutely is possible for a white teacher to present themselves as an open, available, and non-judgmental resource for minority students. Once you do though, be prepared to have your views on racism challenged. I had lived for many years in the relative comfort of my belief that things were getting better, and that the work of dismantling racism was all but done.\n\nNot long after agreeing to write this post, I accompanied my high school son on a Shadow Day/Audition Day trip to a school he was considering. One of our student guides was a gregarious Black undergraduate woman. She briefly touched on the topic of race relations during her presentation to parents, and I could feel the discomfort among the (all white) parents in the room. Afterward, I approached her and told her I was writing a blog post on making minority students comfortable in the classroom, and asked if I could speak with her and get some perspective and input. She readily agreed. “Do you have a pencil? Do you need paper? Let’s do this now!”\n\nFor far too long, we have strengthened and upheld barriers for minority students by avoiding these uncomfortable conversations. This student poured forth a myriad of concerns, complaints, and advice for faculty who want to make minority students more comfortable, and she has been kind enough to allow me to amplify her voice here. She shared with me several stories about her experiences in high school and higher education.\n\nWhen she told her guidance counselor she wanted to attend her current, predominantly white university, she was told the school was not for her, and that she should consider another nearby school that was predominantly Black, even though that school did not have the proper course offerings for her to achieve her goal of becoming an instrumental music educator.\n\n“In class, I am often looked through, or only addressed when something related to minority culture is being discussed, as though I am to confirm that what the instructor is saying is correct. It doesn’t matter if it isn’t African-American culture. The instructor looks at me, and says, ‘Isn’t that right?’ How should I know?”\n\nShe is currently the first Black chapter president of her music fraternity. The first time she applied, she did not get a bid.\n\n“At a conference, I went to the jobs table for an affluent county at our state conference. They looked right through me.” (I have now had a number of BIPOC students, all female in my case, come to me to share similar job fair experiences.)\n\nShe went on to share with me some small thoughts for faculty members:\n\n“I have always been around white people. I like white men.”\n\n“Understand that I am a minority, but I am not lesser.\n\nEvery minority student will approach relationships with white people differently. “I am open and honest. I start open, and then close.”\n\n“Do not be a “White Knight” for me. It just makes me feel a little odd.” (Be an ally, not a savior.) “It’s like they want confirmation.”\n\n“I hate when people try to connect via their own heritage – ‘Oh! You’re Black! I’m German.’”\n\n“They interpret my outgoing personality as Black woman sass.”\n\n“If you ask my opinion, leave space for dialogue. It is not my job to just agree with you.”\n\n“In your classroom, understand that there is more to study than the music of dead white men.”\n\n“We sing ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’, and that’s our black history month.\n\n“It drives me crazy when people say, ‘There’s no racism here.’”\n\n“If you really want to make your minority students feel comfortable, check up on them. Ask them how they’re doing.”\n\nAnd be ready for answers and truths that make you uncomfortable.\n\nA few years ago, I was talking to an old high school friend who is Black. We were discussing the rising unrest in our country, and I made a comment that I didn’t understand where this was coming from, because when we were in high school, everyone got along, and we didn’t have these sorts of issues. My friend very clearly and firmly pointed out that I was in the wrong. Of course we had issues. Of course systemic and blatant racism existed. It wasn’t a problem for me because I wasn’t experiencing it. My privilege allowed me to choose blindness over truth.\n\nWhile it was uncomfortable to have my ingrained racist thinking blatantly highlighted, it was also a wonderful opportunity for me to better understand the impact our society has on our college students before they arrive in our classrooms.\n\nI liken, but do not equate, my experience as white woman to the experiences my BIPOC students have. This was my first point of entry to real empathy with my BIPOC students. I know what it is like to be treated differently, and to have my privileges curbed because of who I am. I know what it is to be taught that my ideas are less valuable, so I can relate when my BIPOC students do not speak up readily in classroom discussions, and I make an effort to ask them for their views. I know what it is like to be interrupted and talked over in meetings, so when I see my BIPOC students being interrupted, I redirect classroom conversation to them. “You were saying something about . . . .”\n\nAnd I also know what it is like to speak up about an injustice that I or other women are experiencing, and to be told that we are not, in fact, experiencing this thing. So when my BIPOC students react with rage similar to my own when someone says racism doesn’t exist, or “I don’t see color,” I acknowledge their feelings. I have learned to give them space to voice their thoughts, opinions, questions, and frustrations.\n\nAgain, the danger here is equating our own experiences with that of our BIPOC students. My status as a white woman gives me certain privileges. What I am suggesting here is that we use our own experiences as a jumping off point for empathy, and begin to act upon that.\n\nThe theory pedagogy community, like many other communities, is at a moment of reckoning right now, and I do urge you to read and keep abreast of the movements taking shape in our community to support BIPOC composers, theorists, artists, faculty, and students, and to call out and end racism. And I urge you to get involved.\n\nGetting involved can be daunting, but as a BIPOC flutist colleague advised me, when we served on a roundtable discussion on racism together, “You don’t have to do it all. Don’t look at these big organizations and corporations doing these big things, and get overwhelmed and quit. You can start with small actions. Check up on your BIPOC students, especially right now. And do little things each day. Even the smallest actions matter.”"
