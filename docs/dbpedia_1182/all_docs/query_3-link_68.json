        "text": "Representation matters\n\nFor many African Americans, content is a common language and overall,. Black audiences spend more time with media than any other group in the U.S. Black America represents a unique opportunity for brands and content providers combining cultural influence, media engagement and substantial buying power. Like all viewers, how Black audiences discover and discuss content is changing—so how brands win a share of Black consumers’ buying power is changing as well. Here’s where you will find the latest Nielsen insights on Black and African American viewership trends, media representation and cultural influence.\n\nSupporting Black-owned media\n\n“Buying Black” isn’t just a priority for diverse consumers, it’s an increasing focus among advertisers across the media industry. Today, the need for trusted voices to herald the issues, trends and triumphs of Black America remains clear. After the reckoning of 2020, brands and advertisers acknowledged Black-owned media as an integral missing piece in their efforts to not only reach but advocate for Black communities.\n\nNielsen has collaborated with the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) to support the certification process, expanding the pipeline of diverse owned media officially defined as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE). The more diverse media owners defined as an MBE, the more opportunity for ad spend to be included in an advertiser’s diverse investment goals.\n\nYour Privacy Matters\n\nYour voice, your preferences and the power you yield as a consumer matter. It matters not only to the businesses that produce the products and media you consume, but it also matters to us. At Nielsen, we are committed to being responsible with the personal data we maintain and we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the personal data we collect."
