        "text": "25 Feb 2013\n\nCharlene Soraia\n\nGhost\n\nPeacefrog Records\n\nWE SAY\n\nThe upside of a hit that refuses to go away is the time it gives you to craft your follow up. 24-year-old Brit School graduate Charlene Soraia spent the 38-week chart run of radio monster Wherever You Will Go holed up in the studio with a stellar cast of writers and producers including Eg White, Cathy Dennis and Guy Chambers. It was time well spent; new single Ghost is another mid-tempo ballad that showcases Soraia's recognisable and affecting vocal style, intriguingly written with and about her ex-boyfriend. Easily the match of her debut, Ghost is accompanied by a Seth Kirby-directed video, which has notched up a quarter of a million views in its first month.\n\nCONTACTS\n\nLabel: Phil Vernol, Peacefrog\n\nPublishing: Jamie Campbell, Hunk Dory Music\n\nOnline: Cath Hurley, Charm Factory\n\nPress: Paul Guimaraes, EMI\n\nLive: Joanna Ashmore, CODA\n\nTV: Vic Sindermann, EMI\n\nRadio: Kevin McCabe, EMI\n\nLegal: Ben Mawson, SSB\n\nManagement: Jonathan Morley, Northern Lights"
