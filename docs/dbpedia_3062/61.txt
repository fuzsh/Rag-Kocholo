I check the Reliability Monitor now and again (I'm on Windows 10) and find the Runtime Broker stopped working;

the amazing thing is that most often the time given is exactly when I opened Reliability Monitor as if the Monitor

itself was causing the issue. Anyone else seen this?

On a related note: there is a forum place for Linux/BSD/Mac OS X, but none for Windows, so we seem compelled

to use General Software.

I have no idea about your issue Mr Shrek, but you have just taught me about a feature that I didn't know existed. Thank you!
