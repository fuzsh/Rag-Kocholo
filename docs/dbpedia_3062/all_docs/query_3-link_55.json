        "text": "A title tag determines how your web page will show up in search engine results pages (SERPs). Besides enticing the user to click on the page, it's a small but important ranking factor you shouldn't ignore.\n\nThis guide will teach you everything you should know about title tags and how to set them. We'll go over the best practices you should follow to optimize your tags properly and make every word count.\n\nWhat you will learn\n\nWhat a title tag is and how it differs from an H1 tag and other commonly confused HTML elements.\n\nHow title tags contribute to your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy.\n\nWhat to include in your title tags and how to structure them.\n\nWhat are title tags in SEO?\n\nA title tag is a piece of HTML code that defines a web page's title. Here's what it looks like:\n\nThe title tag shows up as a clickable headline in SERPs, as well as browser tabs and link previews, so it must encapsulate the essence of the web page's content somehow.\n\nWhile you can set a title tag at will, Google may rewrite it for SERPs to make it more relevant according to several factors like user intent and related searches.\n\nWith this in mind, setting a title tag mainly communicates your preference to Google, and the title might remain unchanged if you follow the necessary best practices, which we'll cover later in this guide.\n\nTitle tag vs. page title\n\nTitle tags are the same as page titles, so the difference is only semantic. Depending on your CMS, you may see a \"page title\" section, which indicates you should include the title you want to appear in SERPs.\n\nTitle tag vs. meta title\n\n\"Title tag\" and \"meta title\" are also synonyms, and you may see a title tag referred to as an SEO title or SEO page title.\n\nTitle tag vs. H1\n\nA title tag appears as a SERP headline, while an H1 tag shows up on the actual page as its main heading. Title tags and H1 tags can be identical or similar, but they shouldn't be too different.\n\nTitle tag vs. meta description\n\nMeta descriptions show up under title tags in SERPs, and their main purpose is to provide a short summary of the page. It's important to align the meta description of web pages with the title tag to ensure relevance.\n\nWhy are title tags important?\n\nTitle tags are a notable SEO ranking factor, as confirmed by Google's John Mueller. While a title tag may not be a deal breaker when it comes to a page's SERP position, it helps search engines understand what the page is about.\n\nIf the page's content is accurately represented by the title tag, this gives you some valuable SEO points.\n\nOf course, title tags aren't only meant for search algorithms. They influence various important metrics, such as:\n\nUser experience\n\nClick-through rates\n\nSocial sharing\n\nEye-catching title tags set your page apart in Google's search results and encourage readers to click on it.\n\nWith carefully optimized title tags and smart word choices, you can significantly boost your organic traffic.\n\nTitle tag examples\n\nWe showed you what a title tag looks like in the page's HTML code, now let's see how it appears on other places on the web.\n\nSearch results\n\nThe most important placement of a title tag is in the search results, where it looks like this:\n\nIn a sense, these clickable titles are the search results, and they define a user's first impression of your content. The page title must answer the search query precisely and be engaging enough to invite clicks.\n\nBrowser tabs\n\nUsers are sometimes confused when they see the browser tab displaying a title different from what they see on the page. That's because a browser tab shows the title tag, not the headline found in the body of content.\n\nHere's what the title tag looks like in browser tabs:\n\nLink previews\n\nWhen you share something on social media or via messaging services, you'll almost always get a link preview. It typically contains a thumbnail alongside the page title, like so:\n\nMuch like with search results, title tags in link previews encourage clicks, so getting a page title right can boost traffic from several sources.\n\n9 SEO title tag best practices\n\nWriting good title tags isn't just about naming your page according to its contentâthere's more to it. Here are 9 best practices you can follow to write effective title tags.\n\n1. Analyze the SERPs\n\nWhen you select your core keyword, you must analyze the search results to understand the intent behind it. There are four types of search intent:\n\nInformationalâThe user is looking for high-level information about the topic/product\n\nNavigationalâThe user wants to reach a specific website\n\nCommercialâThe user is in the later stage of their customer journey and is comparing different options\n\nTransactionalâThe user is looking to purchase the product\n\nYou can understand search intent by simply Googling your target keyword. For example, the search results for \"on-page SEO\" are mainly guides and tips, which indicates informational intent.\n\nHowever, if you search for \"on-page SEO software,\" you'll see product round-ups, so the intent is commercial.\n\nUnderstanding search intent helps you see which type of content you should create for the given keyword and how to reflect it in the title tag. You can draw inspiration for the title by examining the search results and your competitors, but make sure to create something unique instead of copying a title verbatim.\n\n2. Target one main keyword\n\nYour title tag should always focus on a single primary keyword. You'll most likely already know what that keyword is because you'll uncover it while doing keyword research before you start writing.\n\nLet's say your main keyword phrase is \"on-page SEO.\" In this case, it should be the focal point of the title tag with only a few additions that make the title engaging. For example, your title tag can be:\n\n\"Mastering On-Page SEO: A Complete Guide\"\n\nNow, this doesn't mean you shouldn't include any other keywordsâjust make sure to do it naturally. Keyword stuffing is one of the quickest ways to damage your SERP rank.\n\nFor example, if you have a shop selling water bottles in California, don't do this:\n\n\"Cheap Water Bottles | Water Bottles Shop California | Water Bottles in California\"\n\nInstead, do this:\n\n\"Best Cheap Water Bottles in California\"\n\nBy using keywords naturally, you'll avoid SEO penalties while still being able to fit more than a single core keyword in your title.\n\n3. Include important words first\n\nA page's title tag must be compelling at first glance, so you need to pay attention to word order. The goal is to let the user see the most important words first, as doing so decreases the chances they'll scroll past your page.\n\nLet's go back to our \"on-page SEO software\" example and assume you're writing a listicle and buying guide. In this case, you should avoid titles like this:\n\n\"Learn How To Choose the Best On-Page SEO Software\"\n\nInstead, go with something like this:\n\n\"Best SEO SoftwareâReviews + Buying Guide\"\n\nIf you're unsure which words to place first, there's a simple rule to followâfocus on the main keyword and incorporate it at the front of your title tag.\n\n4. Optimize title tag length\n\nA title tag should be between 50 and 60 characters long. This includes spaces, so there's no room for wasteâyou must include all the relevant elements and phrases without fluff.\n\nIf your title tag exceeds the available space, it will cut off and won't be displayed properly on the search engine results page. Instead, the user will only see a part of it followed by an ellipsis, like so:\n\nTo avoid this, keep your title tags descriptive but concise. You might be compelled to add adjectives like in the above example to evoke a specific feeling and communicate a product's benefit, but keep them to a minimum. Stick to the page's core idea, and you can flower up the H1 more if needed.\n\n5. Use title tag separators\n\nTitle tag separators like dashes, pipes, and colons are an excellent way to structure your title if you want to add short descriptions without damaging the title's effectiveness. They're also used to naturally add secondary keywords to the title and are particularly useful in e-commerce.\n\nHere's an example of a well-implemented separator:\n\nIf it weren't for the pipe that separates categories from the main keyword, the title would look a bit jumbled.\n\nAs mentioned, the most important words shouldn't be placed so far in the title, so a separator helps maintain the right structure while still making the title descriptive and engaging.\n\n6. Make the title similar to the H1 tag\n\nAs mentioned, Google rewrites title tags if it feels they could be better.\n\nA study by Cyrus Shepard found that this can happen in a whopping 61.6% of cases. Upon further examination, the study concluded that similarities between a title tag and an H1 tag can drastically reduce the rewriting.\n\nThis makes perfect sense, as Google's algorithms care about consistency and an accurate representation of the page's contents. With that in mind, a good title tag should closely resemble the H1 that appears as the headline in the content's body.\n\nNote that this doesn't mean your title tag and H1 tag must be identical - though it's no problem if they are. What matters is to include the core keyword in both and make sure the rest is similar enough. Take this title as an example:\n\nIt doesn't precisely match the H1 tag.\n\nStill, the tags are similar enough, which ensures the consistency that Google is looking for. So if you plan on making the title tag different from the H1, make sure there aren't significant differences between the two.\n\n7. Write unique title tags\n\nEach of your pages must have a unique title tag that matches the user's search intent. Otherwise, Google's algorithms may not know that the page is relevant, even if its content gives users what they need.\n\nFor example, if you're selling gardening supplies, it's okay to go with a broad title for the homepage or the page containing all your products. In that case, you can use something like:\n\n\"Buy High-Quality Gardening Supplies\"\n\nBut when writing title tags for pages dedicated to specific products or categories, you shouldn't repeat this generic title. Instead, make sure to diversify your title tags according to the products so that both Google and users know exactly what the page is about, for example:\n\n\"Seed Starters â High-Quality Gardening Supplies\"\n\n8. Pay attention to word choice\n\nYou can only fit a handful of words in your title tags, so each one should be there for a reason.\n\nWhile your titles should be concise, it doesn't mean they should be boring.\n\nMake sure to include power words that evoke emotion and encourage action.\n\nFor example, if you write about tips for treating the common cold, don't go with a dull title like:\n\n\"A Guide to Treating the Common Cold\"\n\nInstead, do what Healthline did here:\n\nHealthline knows that readers want quick remedies, and the title reflects this. It also contains the main keyword and is concise enough to draw attention.\n\nThe power words you'll use mainly depend on your content's type or topic, but here are some universal examples:\n\nUltimate\n\nProven\n\nMust-have\n\nInstant\n\nAs a side note, don't overpromise when using power words. Nobody likes clickbait, so make sure your content delivers on the promise made in the title.\n\n9. Follow a set title tag structure\n\nConsistency is crucial for title tag optimization, as it promotes brand recognition. There's a high chance your pages will compete with countless others, so a bit of structure and familiarity can go a long way toward setting you apart from the crowd.\n\nWhichever structure you choose, try to stick to it across your pages as much as possible. If you need some ideas, here are some common formulas:\n\nPrimary keyword â Secondary keyword | Brand: Used Cars â Buy Used Vehicles in NYC | Cars.com\n\nProduct â Category | Brand: Men's Slippers â Men's Footwear | Nike\n\nCategory | Specific products | Brand: Women's Tops | Shirts, Sweaters, & Cardigans | Zara\n\nNote that the brand name isn't mandatory, but it's beneficial for standing out among other search results. This is particularly important if you run an e-commerce store, as the user will likely see many page titles that look pretty much the same.\n\nIf you can add the brand name without exceeding the character limit or omitting important keywords, go for it.\n\nNailing the right title tag structure might take some experimenting, so play around with a few options to see what works best. You can track your page's rankings and performance using Google Search Console, so do some A/B testing until you zero in on the best structure.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nA title tag is an HTML element that determines your page's title in SERPs, link previews, and browser tabs. It's not the same as an H1 tag, which is displayed as the headline on the page itself.\n\nTitle tags are important for two reasonsâGoogle considers them a ranking factor, and they have the power to draw a reader's attention and boost your click-through rate and traffic.\n\nWhen writing a title tag, focus on a specific keyword and analyze the SERPs to understand its search intent. Doing so helps you create the type of content that matches the intent and gives users what they're looking for.\n\nImportant words should be placed at the front of a title tag, followed by other elements like the secondary keyword, short description, category, and/or brand name.\n\nYou can use separators to structure your title tags and implement the necessary keywords naturally. When you decide on a structure, stick to it across your pages to ensure consistency.\n\nYour entire title tag must fit into 60 characters, including spaces, so there's no room for fluff. Stick to keywords, power words, and other elements that will make your title compelling.\n\nConclusion\n\nA title tag might seem like a small piece of the SEO puzzle, but don't underestimate its impact. A well-written title can make a world of difference to your organic traffic and improve your SERP rank, so make sure it accurately represents your page.\n\nBy adhering to the best practices outlined in this guide, you'll be well on your way to creating compelling title tags, that not only rank well but also entice clicks."
