        "text": "“Our entire history, and everything we develop, centers on the principle of optimization,” says Lourens du Plessis, VP of Customer Value at Modular Mining. “The people that started this company – including a Professor of Chemical Engineering – understood how to use linear programming to optimize the production environment in the mine.”\n\nYou’ve probably heard the story: in the late 1970s, then-Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Arizona, Dr. James White, was visiting the nearby Phelps Dodge Tyrone Mine when he witnessed trucks idling in queues at one shovel, while other shovels sat hanging, ready to load but with no truck nearby. “There’s got to be a better way,” he famously said, spawning what eventually became our unrivalled fleet optimization algorithm, as well as our subsequent maintenance and machine guidance technologies, and the Modular Mining company as a whole.\n\nDr. White and his colleagues helped Phelps Dodge optimize their truck assignments in an automated and dynamic manner, which in turn optimized their fleet utilization and, ultimately, enabled them to move 11% more material on average (click here to read a 1981 article from the Silver City Daily Press). While automating truck assignments still drives much of the logic within today’s version of the DISPATCH FMS, the algorithm has evolved to consider more data and provide better granularity than we could decades ago.\n\nBut optimization is not just a matter of a really good algorithm. It also requires people, and the volition or commitment of those people – on both the mine side and the technology side.\n\n“Without these three factors, you can’t have optimization,” says du Plessis. “You won’t get optimization unless you want it.”\n\nThe key to mining optimization is in an FMS’s ability to make the best decision, quickly. Systems that simply measure or track the movement of material from a particular loading location to a particular dumping location can typically offer cost-effective production tracking, but they don’t actually optimize an operation. Simply put, they don’t make decisions or offer targeted insights that improve decision-making and, ultimately, operational performance – and therefore result in unresolved inefficiencies and unrealized value.\n\nTypically, one of these systems will “lock” one piece of equipment to another and trucks will run between the same shovel and the same crusher for an entire shift. This process is typically decided by the shift supervisor, based on their understanding of their goals for the oncoming shift. But the process can be very inefficient and prone to human bias, since it’s based on personal judgement rather than objective computed calculations. It also can’t account for upset events – so an unexpected hose failure on a shovel or poorly-executed operator break can wreak havoc on a mine’s ability to meet their shift production goals.\n\n“You should only use the equipment you need to meet your goals,” Ferreira continues. “Within the optimization process, the DISPATCH system will calculate the number of trucks that are required to achieve a particular goal throughout the shift, based on how the performance is going.” That gives the mine the opportunity to park unneeded trucks, which provides an extreme cost savings and further minimizes the potential for queues.\n\nA direct example of this comes from the AGD Diamond Mine, in Russia, which dramatically reduced their truck queues at the crusher, and resulting idle time, after working with our support team and leveraging the DISPATCH FMS to optimize and automate operator assignments.\n\nSimilarly, after conducting an ROI analysis to determine whether to purchase a new haul truck or to instead implement the DISPATCH FMS’ optimization capabilities, the Copper Mountain Mine, in British Colombia, Canada, found that the FMS helped them realize a 4% hourly production increase – the equivalent to the volume of material moved by an additional 1.04 haul trucks – without the $4.2 million price-tag of a new truck.
