        "text": "2.1 The nature of health care competition\n\nTraditional competition in health care involves one or more elements (e.g. price, quality, convenience, and superior products or services); however, competition can also be based on new technology and innovation. A key role of competition in health care is the potential to provide a mechanism for reducing health care costs. Competition generally eliminates inefficiencies that would otherwise yield high production costs, which are ultimately transferred to patients via high health service and delivery costs. Fuch (1988) noted that during the 1980s, the US government sought to change health care in America via the use of market principles to allocate scarce resources. However, Reinhardt (1996) reported that competition could not enhance efficiency in the health care industry because public and private insurance companies were paying for three-quarters of the health care bills. Likewise, Porter and Teisberg (2004) reported that competition in the US had become zero-sum-based, a situation in which health care system participants are actively engaged in dividing value instead of creating value. In some cases, this type of competition erodes existing value through unnecessary costs. Porter and Teisberg identified several features of zero-based competition in health care associated with unfortunate strategic choices: incorrect level of competition, focus on cost reduction, incorrect geographic market, focus on satisfaction surveys, and offering improper incentives to subscribers as well as providers.\n\nPorter and Teisberg advocate a positive-sum competition in health care characterized by the following features: prevention, diagnoses, and treatment of specific diseases; improved value; proper level of competition; suitable market; and correct information about providers, treatment, and alternatives for specific conditions. Although positive-sum based competition has many potential benefits, it is not an assured success because substantial reforms are required. Nevertheless, competition remains a vital activity in the health care industry and consists of three components that encompass all the major stakeholders to include providers, payers, employers and patients. The first component is comprised of individuals who provide health care (e.g. physicians and other practitioners). Greenberg (1991) defined forms of competition for physicians. Physicians may compete for patients who are able to pay for services and do not have health insurance, or for patients who have their expenditures paid for by third-party insurers – for these, physicians compete on a non-price basis, based on location, colleagues’ referrals, and reputation. Physicians may also compete for affiliation with a PPO or by establishing an independent practice association (IPA) to ensure their patient flow. Finally, physicians may compete in the medical market, by reducing competition from non-physicians such as psychologists and podiatrists.\n\nThe second component is comprised of the organizations that provide health care services (e.g. hospitals, hospital systems, or other health services organizations). Hospitals compete for physicians, third-party payers, and patients simultaneously (Harris and McDaniel, 1993). In the past, hospitals competed for physicians by offering more highly trained supportive staff or better equipment. However, current trends indicate that hospitals are more likely to compete for patients by providing more services, better amenities or discounted prices (Fuch, 1988). The strong competition for medical talent and technology exists locally and globally. The places where cutting edge technologies and new medical discoveries have the most power in recruiting the best and the brightest medical personnel. In the world of health care, organizations must consider physician migration and physician shortages in recruiting the best and brightest health care providers. The recruitment of physicians has always been challenging and especially so in the primary care specialties in rural and underserved areas. A wise organization will look carefully at the age distribution of its staff and plan well ahead for recruitment needs.\n\nThe third component comprises organizations that provide health care financing and insurance and health care plans (e.g. health management organizations (HMO), preferred provider organizations (PPO), and various insurance companies). Buyers of insurance plans must be knowledgeable about the varying prices and must be able to make an informed choice when deciding on what plans to buy. Under these assumptions, competition among health insurance plans could be easily identified to factors such as access, premiums, benefit, and quality. However, because plans usually present different degrees of freedom in provider choice or benefit/coverage services, this makes the comparison among plans very complicated, if not impossible for patients.\n\nTo better understand the nature of competition in health care, Zwanziger and Melnick (1996) proposed a model to analyze two types of health care market competitions: competition in physician-dominated markets (i.e. quality or non-price competition) and competition in insurer-dominated marks (i.e. price competition). For competition within physician-dominated markets, physicians decide when to admit patients and strongly influence the choice of hospital. Upon admission, physicians continue to dominate the distribution of hospital resources and operations relating to treatment. In this model, hospitals essentially compete for patients through efforts to attract physicians. In addition, under the fee-for-service and usual-customary-reasonable (UCR) payment mechanisms, physicians are usually insensitive to the cost of care at different hospitals. The competition of hospital services in this case is largely determined by its location, quality as perceived by physicians, and amenities. Since quality costs money, it presupposes quantitative adequacy and often more care (Donabedian, 1980). Studies show that hospital costs tend to increase in the quality competition market dominated by physicians (Aaron, 1991; Robinson and Luft, 1985, 1987, 1988).\n\nHospitals and insurers have a more aggressive role in the insurer-dominated market. To secure network contracts, hospitals have to compete for inclusion in insurers’ provider networks as well as try to control costs effectively. Nevertheless, the possession of a contract does not guarantee an increase in patient flow. A hospital loses contracts with managed care plans if it does not secure enough patients. In this market, price becomes an important factor in acquiring managed care contracts and retaining a patient base, thus, providers are forced to become price-sensitive. Insurance plans also compete for cost to payers, quality of provider networks, credentialing screening, and quality assessment procedures.\n\n2.3 Concepts of service quality and patient satisfaction\n\nExperts have struggled for decades to formulate a concise, meaningful, and generally applicable definition of the quality of health care. For example, Palmer et al. (1991) defined quality of health care as “the production of improved health and satisfaction of a population within the constraints of existing technology, resources, and consumer circumstances.” For physicians, quality of health generally involves a technical and a physician-patient interaction.\n\nThe technical aspects of quality of care consist of two sub-dimensions: the appropriateness of the services provided and the skill with which appropriate care is performed. Appropriateness of the services provided requires that physicians make high-quality decisions about care for each patient. The skill with which appropriate care is performed requires skill, judgment, and timeliness of execution. The quality of the interaction between physicians and patients depends on several interrelated factors, including the quality of communication, the physician’s ability to maintain the patient’s trust, and the physician’s ability to treat the patient with concern, empathy, honesty, tact and sensitivity.\n\nSatisfaction with health care is closely related to concepts of health care quality. Ware et al. (1977) proposed that patient satisfaction should be a multidimensional concept. These dimensions include “the art of care”, which focuses on the personality attributes of the health provider; “technical competence”, or the patient’s perception of the provider’s knowledge and expertise; “the physical environment” as perceived by the patient; and “efficacy of care”, or the client’s perception of outcome. Linder-Pelz (1982) further suggested ten constructs or elements that should be used to determine satisfaction: accessibility or convenience, availability of resources, continuity of care, efficacy or outcomes of care, finances, humanness, information gathering, pleasantness of surroundings, and quality or competence.\n\nDonabedian (1980) noted that client/patient satisfaction is not only an important component of the quality of care, but also a heavy contributor to the definition of quality from the perspective of clients’ values and expectations. Essentially, satisfaction could be seen as an objective of care (psychological health) or a contributor to other objectives and outcomes. For example, satisfied patients are more likely to better comply with providers’ medical regimens, and to cooperate or maintain relationship with specific providers. Learning from these concepts, we know that satisfaction plays an important role in quality measure and improvement.\n\nFor research purposes, the satisfaction construct may be used in two ways. It may be used as a dependent variable to evaluate provider services and facilities (based on the assumption that patient satisfaction is an indicator of the structure, process, and outcomes). It may also be considered an independent variable that predicts consumer behaviors (with the assumption that differences in satisfaction influence what people do) (Ware et al., 1977). In today’s highly competitive health care market, satisfaction serves not only as a monitor for quality and improvement but also serves to attract patients and insurers.\n\n3.1 Competition, strategic mission and patient satisfaction\n\nA significant element of the model is the organization’s strategic mission and goals. The mission or goal of an organization provides a general direction regarding quality of health and costs that reflects the overall organizational internal environment. An industry’s external environment, of which competition is a major driver, influences the strategic direction of the organizations within the industry. The mission defines what an organization can do in terms of quality and costs and articulates the basic values and principles that guide how services are delivered. For example, some hospitals build their reputation on the principles of quality, cooperation, compassion and innovation as the primary drivers and not necessarily cost (Cleveland Hospital). If every US resident had an insurmountable amount of money to spend on health care, then health care costs would not be a problem. Every consumer of health care will not desire to shop around for price alone, but will want to shop for many things such as quality and customer service. On the other hand, many patients will want the best care for the lowest cost. In the current health care environment, this is rarely found. Patients must make a decision and unfortunately sacrifice one for the other. Therefore, the mission and goals and the financial support institutions have, allow them to attract the best medical doctors, nurses, support staff, acquire the most updated and the newest equipment and technology and attract patients. In connecting competition to the organization’s strategic mission and goals and ultimately to patient satisfaction requires a model that defines the role competition in a way that what the customer expects in terms of needs and wants is factored into health care design, communication, pricing and the delivery of appropriate, competitively viable health care services.\n\n3.2 Competition and patient satisfaction\n\nMiller (1996) and Porter and Tiesberg (2004) noted that current competition among health plans, hospitals, and physicians has been primarily based upon price. The breadth of the network and style of care is also considered. Competition has resulted in lower hospital costs and health care premiums, with premium reductions up to 10 percent (Enthoven and Vorhaus, 1997). However, it is not clear whether the cost savings from price competition is a result of improved efficiency or from sacrificing the quality of care.\n\nA study showed that hospitals that are subject to more intense competition and greater fiscal pressure from Medicare and Medi-Cal reduced their provision of uncompensated care relative to hospitals facing less pressure from the sources. According to the authors’ estimate, hospitals would have provided 36 percent more uncompensated care than was actually provided in 1989, if they had not been subjected to increasing price competition from growth of managed care plans and financial tightening in public programs. However, Brook and Kosecoff (1998) suggest that as competition intensifies, one very likely event to occur is the renaming of “quality of care” to “patient satisfaction.” People interested in making money are likely to use marketing techniques and measurement of patient satisfaction to convince people to join their organizations. The quality of care is hard to quantify and compare. Those groups that are currently experiencing a difficult time with HMOs and bureaucracies (e.g. elderly, poor, women, and children) are likely to be even more vulnerable.\n\nUsing a competitive model, it has been assumed that a homogeneous service is being bought and sold, and the competition is based on price. However, Jacobs (1997) reported that product quality is a major element of health care. It is also a common practice for health insurance companies to offer different types of policies in terms of coverage. This can be viewed as differences in the quality of the policies, which yields differences in the quality of services. It must be acknowledged that the market is imperfectly competitive (i.e. oligopolistic and monopolistic markets are often found in the health care industry) due to such factors as entry barriers, asymmetry of information, monopoly power, non-uniformity in health service quality or character, prevalent externalities, common motivations other than pure profit, and considerable degree of uncertainty (Folland et al., 1993).\n\nDue to the imperfections in competition, market failures also exist in the health care industry. Though vigorous price competition is not usually a characteristic of an oligopolistic market, quality competition is. Mansfield (1988) stated that technological change and productivity increases can offset imperfection in competitive market. In imperfect competition, firms usually have more resources to devote to research and experimentation than their counterparts. The introduction of the innovation may not be worthwhile, unless the firm has sufficient control over the market to reap the rewards of innovation. Since competitors can imitate innovations very quickly, innovation may not be profitable. Jacobs (1997) noted that when a supplier can vary quality, customers are attracted on the basis of its quality. This phenomenon of “product differentiation” implies that each supplier is facing a downward-sloping demand curve, and that they can choose to compete with other providers on the basis of price or product quality. This difference in quality not only improves the supplier’s competitiveness, but can also lead to “brand loyalty”, which is heavily related to patient satisfaction with the product or service.\n\nIn the health care industry, high technology services tend to attract customers. The more services a health care organization offers, the more competitive it will be for exclusive contracts with employers and other third party payers. Under this assumption, competition could result in the tendency to either have duplicate services in excess of regional needs, or acceleration of technology changes and/or product differentiation. Under such circumstances, competition is not better than regulation with respect to control of costs in the adoption of new technology.\n\nCompetition may be better in terms of access improvement. Teisberg et al. (1994) suggest that competition in health care compels providers to deliver increasing value to customers, while the fundamental driver of this continuous quality improvement and cost reduction is “innovation.” Teisberg et al. also suggest that without incentives to sustain innovation in health care, short-term cost savings will soon be overwhelmed by the desire to widen access. The failure to promote innovation will lead to lower quality or more rationing of care.\n\nA study by Zwanziger et al. (1996)) examined factors influencing two measures of service mix (specialization and differentiation) before and after the introduction of new reimbursement mechanisms, including post-prospective payment system (PPS) in California. The results of this study suggest that:\n\ncompetition among hospitals tends to increase differentiation, whereas higher financial PPS pressure is associated with increased specialization;\n\nhospitals tend to adopt some high visibility services offered by their competitors while filling market niches selectively overall; and\n\nthe cost savings expected for specialization may prevail only for narrowly defined services.\n\nIn order to examine the relationship between competition and other variables within a health care organization entity (e.g. hospital), we define competition as the actions of that entity to obtain the best resources (including technology, human resources, infrastructure) that will provide an advantage over other similar entities and help the entity maintain leadership in the market for that segment of the population served. Consistent with the previous discussions and background, we propose that competition in health care, could possibly initiate technology changes or product differentiation. Although services may be excessive or more costly, improving patient satisfaction is the ultimate anticipated result of competition in the health care industry.\n\nP1\n\nAs the level of competition within the health care market increases, the level of patient satisfaction increases."
