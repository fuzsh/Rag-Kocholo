        "text": "For months now, I have been reading the numerous problems Fios internet customers are having with Fios internet/Actiontech Router and Windows Vista and there has been no acknowledgement by Verizon of this current major issue.\n\nI have also experienced the exact same issue for months now since I switched to Verizon FIOS internet. Previously I had Comcast HSI using my Windows Vista laptop. I had their service for over a year and I NEVER has a problem with the Windows Vista globe icon disappearing and loosing internet connection. The Globe always stayed on and never went away and I never lost connection when I had Comcast\n\nI had Verizon FIOS installed last September with my Windows Vista computer and my wireless internet connection started to drop from day 1 and it has been a daily occurrence for over 5 months now. It has gotten so bad, I have had to hardwire my laptop to to be able to use the internet uninterrupted.\n\nThis is what daily scenario is:\n\nWhen I turn on my laptop(with Windows Vista, I can initially get full internet access(with the globe on and it says \"Local and internet). After about 10 minutes or less, the globe switches to \"local only\" and I can still get internet access. After another 5 or so minutes, a large X covers the globe and I lose internet connection entirely. The actiontech router wireless signal is no longer listed as one of the wireless networks. The only way for me to regain internet access is either to restart my laptop or reboot the actiontech router.\n\nNumeorus posts here, over by DSL forums(Broadband Reports),Microsoft's website and a few othere websites detail this issue.\n\nI am extremely shocked and surprised that Verizon has not tried to fix this issue by working with both the makers of the Actiontech Router as well as Microsoft to find out what the problem is and how to fix it.\n\nI would just like to reiterate I strongly believe this is primarily a FIOS internet issue since I previously had Comcast HSI for over a year with the same Windows Vista laptop and I NEVER had that problem. Also, I can connect to my neighbors wireless connection(she uses Comcast HSI) and when I do, the globe stay on all the time on my computer and the internet does not lose connection.\n\nI know that there are a couple of Verizon employees here. Please tell the higher ups who handle FIOS internet that this is a major issue that needs to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nP.S: Please don't tell me to go by my own router because then, I will have to deal with the issues of setting it up to work with Fios TV and the related VOD, widgets, remote DVR compatability issues to deal with. I don't think I can deal with the additional headaches."
