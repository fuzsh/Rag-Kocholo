        "text": "UsageÂ¶\n\nThe following mdp options control the CompEL protocol:\n\nChoose Z if your membrane is in the \\(xy\\)-plane (Fig. 47). Ions will be exchanged between compartments depending on their \\(z\\)-positions alone. swap-frequency determines how often a swap attempt will be made. This step requires that the positions of the split groups, the ions, and possibly the solvent molecules are communicated between the parallel processes, so if chosen too small it can decrease the simulation performance. The Position swapping entry in the cycle and time accounting table at the end of the md.log file summarizes the amount of runtime spent in the swap module.\n\nsplit-group0 and split-group1 are two index groups that define the boundaries between the two compartments, which are usually the centers of the channels. If massw-split0 or massw-split1 are set to yes, the center of mass of each index group is used as boundary, here in \\(z\\)-direction. Otherwise, the geometrical centers will be used (\\(\\times\\) in Fig. 47 A). If, such as here, a membrane channel is selected as split group, the center of the channel will define the dividing plane between the compartments (dashed horizontal lines). All index groups must be defined in the index file.\n\nIf, to restore the requested ion counts, an ion from one compartment has to be exchanged with a water molecule from the other compartment, then those molecules are swapped which have the largest distance to the compartment-defining boundaries (dashed horizontal lines). Depending on the ion concentration, this effectively results in exchanges of molecules between the light blue volumes. If a channel is very asymmetric in \\(z\\)-direction and would extend into one of the swap volumes, one can offset the swap exchange plane with the bulk-offset parameter. A value of 0.0 means no offset \\(b\\), values \\(-1.0 < b < 0\\) move the swap exchange plane closer to the lower, values \\(0 < b < 1.0\\) closer to the upper membrane. Fig. 47 A (left) depicts that for the A compartment.\n\nThe group name of solvent molecules acting as exchange partners for the ions has to be set with solvent-group. The number of different ionic species under control of the CompEL protocol is given by the iontypes parameter, while iontype0-name gives the name of the index group containing the atoms of this ionic species. The reference number of ions of this type can be set with the iontype0-in-A and iontype0-in-B options for compartments A and B, respectively. Obviously, the sum of iontype0-in-A and iontype0-in-B needs to equal the number of ions in the group defined by iontype0-name. A reference number of -1 means: use the number of ions as found at the beginning of the simulation as the reference value.\n\nIf coupl-steps is set to 1, then the momentary ion distribution determines whether ions are exchanged. coupl-steps > 1 will use the time-average of ion distributions over the selected number of attempt steps instead. This can be useful, for example, when ions diffuse near compartment boundaries, which would lead to numerous unproductive ion exchanges. A threshold of 1 means that a swap is performed if the average ion count in a compartment differs by at least 1 from the requested values. Higher thresholds will lead to toleration of larger differences. Ions are exchanged until the requested number \\(\\pm\\) the threshold is reached.\n\nThe cylinder options are used to define virtual geometric cylinders around the channelâs pore to track how many ions of which type have passed each channel. Ions will be counted as having traveled through a channel according to the definition of the channelâs cylinder radius, upper and lower extension, relative to the location of the respective split group. This will not affect the actual flux or exchange, but will provide you with the ion permeation numbers across each of the channels. Note that an ion can only be counted as passing through a particular channel if it is detected within the defined split cylinder in a swap step. If swap-frequency is chosen too high, a particular ion may be detected in compartment A in one swap step, and in compartment B in the following swap step, so it will be unclear through which of the channels it has passed.\n\nA double-layered system for CompEL simulations can be easily prepared by duplicating an existing membrane/channel MD system in the direction of the membrane normal (typically \\(z\\)) with gmx editconf -translate 0 0 <l_z>, where l_z is the box length in that direction. If you have already defined index groups for the channel for the single-layered system, gmx make_ndx -n index.ndx -twin will provide you with the groups for the double-layered system."
