One thing I think that would make it better is making the user ratings and reviews more accessible.\n\nFirstly, I general access the site from my iPhone 7+. I can't for the life of me figure out how to rate the modules I own using this interface. It would be good to make the ratings more visible as well. They are really buried, which is a shame as feedback from other users is one of the things that really helps me decide in a purchase or not.\n\nSecond, could we get written reviews too? Ratings are useful, but written reviews give context to the rating. We don't all create the same music, and we all have different preferences for UI, menu diving etc.\n\nThis is a great site and am happy to support, but really do think this would make the site better for the community.\n\nbatch Posted: Nov 7th 2017, 14:06\n\nThread: Request\n\nThis is a really great site.

I've been out of the loop for about 7 years and am astonished by the wealth of modules out there now.\n\nDo I buy a cheap analogue vco to go with my Doepfer 110 &111.1, or sell those and get a Quadnic or maybe a wavetable oscillator?\n\nI can spare maybe Â£200 to add to what I get for the two vcos.\n\nAny views appreciated! Thanks\n\nLugia Posted: Nov 5th 2017, 04:25\n\nAn idea I'm tinkering around with, trying to concoct a very large-scale albeit semi-portable system. Cabs are ADDAC powered Monster cases: 901M 21U with a 901MS2 dual 19\" rack header (2x 2U) populated with some framework for tiles, mainly to augment the oscillators. Bottom row is a separate 901M 3U 197hp skiff, pretty much entirely devoted to control surfaces/devices, including the output mixer stage.\n\nCase dimensions aren't too godawful - the initial 901M 21U comes out to more or less 41\" w x 33.5\" h x 18\" d, and onto this add another 3.5\" for the rack extension on top. Not counting the 197hp skiff (skiff?) as it's not attached to the huge clunky cab. Not an 'I'm gonna pull the trigger on this'n'-type setup, but more of a slow evolver toward an eventual end-configuration (provided I don't suddenly decide 'fukkit' and start off on some other direction). Also have to get settled on the tile housing/power on top, as there's quite a few possible directions for power configs and closing up the backside in some manner.\n\nAstute users who've read my long-ago prior post on design will note that, yep, this follows that 'up-left/down-right/source-top/control-bottom' canon. Definitely works. The only place this gets a bit subverted is in the tiles, although like I note above, much of that is intended as augmentation for the oscillators/sources, so it actually does fit, after a fashion.\n\nHave to admit, I do like these ADDAC cab designs. Yeah, the odd-hp-count widths are a bit annoying, but what they're cooking up looks sturdy, has ample DC (10A on the +/- 12V rails! in the big cab), and even with the shipping is still not all too horrible as far as price goes. In fact, the cabs (minus the tile hardware/power; need to sort that cost later) would run about $2800 powered and shipped to the USA, which beats the Doepfer 168hp 'dual Monster' setup at around $3k and also allows the 4 x 84 hp tile arrangement which the Doepfers aren't capable of. Plus, the ergonomics look right - they even have handle cutouts on the sides of the big honker.\n\nLooks interesting, I think. Now, let's see how long it takes before I get majorly distracted by some other probably-expensive idea.\n\nsislte Posted: Nov 1st 2017, 18:29\n\nA wee bit harder to chew than the two latest tracks that I posted. Some dissonance, a bit off beat in places and \"creatively\" mixed.\n\nI hope you like it anyway! I do. But all comments, positive or negative, are highly appreciated.\n\nThe generated melody comes from my 0-coast, the hand chased melody comes from my Minilogue, the background ambience and the plucky bell sound comes from Rings (of course ).\n\nBut who's the drummer? The first correct answer will be rewarded with a pineapple owl."
