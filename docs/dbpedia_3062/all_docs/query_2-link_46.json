        "text": "If you feel like you're not being appreciated, don't worry. 😊😊 Remember that your worth and value come from within, and your efforts are important, even if they go unnoticed by others. Here are some things you can do to boost your mood and remind yourself of your worth: - Practice self-care and prioritize your well-being. - Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. - Surround yourself with positive and supportive people. - Focus on your strengths and the things you do well. - Remind yourself that everyone has their own struggles and may not always be able to show appreciation. Remember, you are deserving of love, respect, and appreciation - regardless of whether others recognize it or not. Keep shining your light and know that you are valued and appreciated, even if it's just by yourself.Feeling unappreciated, Don't worried.\n\nWe all just want to feel special and recognised when it comes down to it. We all know deep down we are far more than we are being and when people really ‘see us’ it can make all the difference. We must stop trying to to change people and instead support them to be the best version they can be. Cheer people on, focus on what others are doing right instead of wrong. Be a builder of life instead of a taker. People don’t need saving they need to know that people love them no matter what happens. Love is the support people need, listening without interrupting, judging or giving solutions is a skill to master. When you allow others to express openly with no judgement they get that energy out and the solution often comes to them, without you doing anything but being there!\n\nIf you don’t feel great right now is because you are not taking ordered action to go in the direction that you want. If you don’t know what direction you want to go towards you are either letting someone else decide that for you or realise that finding clarity is the first action you need to take. You are limited only by the decisions you are taking or not taking. Pro tip: you need to understand what you want to feel, not what you want to do or have. There’s an almost limitless amount of actions, things or environmenta able to give you a specific feeling, be mindful to not get stuck in one you think should make you feel a specific way but actually doesn’t. Love & peace ✌️\n\nAre You Ready For New Love? Not wanting to be alone isn’t the same as being “ready” for love. For that matter, neither is wanting to “be” loved. So how do you know the difference? How can you tell if you are really ready to find a love that lasts a lifetime?

I do this because I know there is always an adventure to be had so I am up for it. However, when I do care about a choice (dinner, activity, etc.), I do share it. I feel when a person never puts their choice on the table, you are showing those around you how they can treat you. After awhile, they simply stop asking and start telling. When this happens, being told rather than asked, you may start to not like it. When and if you do speak up, that person is then going to be confused and maybe even a bit frustrated. I am not validating those actions at all, but can you understand their confusion? Telling another what you like, prefer, and appreciate, is another form of being open and honest. It is a way for them to better know and love you. It also shows you and the people around you that you matter. Remember to put yourself into the equation. When you truly don't have a preference for something, allow the other person to decide. But when you do have a preference, remember to speak up because now you understand why it is so important. With love, ~Connie Jo Holmes\n\nHappy International Self-Care Day! “Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow.
