        "text": "Make the compel worth the price.\n\nIf the Geometer simply showing up means Fate points are handed out like candy, make him challenging enough that they'll need those four points whenever he shows up! Giving him more stunts, or more powerful stunts, would be a decent place to start in doing that.\n\nCompels aren't always the right choice.\n\nIf you're struggling to make compels seem like the right mechanic for the job, maybe they aren't the right mechanic for the job. For the NPC ally, often his appearance would be triggered by a player spending a Fate point to make a declaration. You can counter that by giving him a Fate point instead of taking his. While other players could technically try to do the same, each gaining a new Fate point for your refusal, that would cheapen the first player's transaction. Players in a Fate game should be open to recognising this and acting accordingly: one of Fate's core concepts is that something which fails should not be tried again with no variation until it succeeds.\n\nCompels Have Teeth\n\nThe thing with compels is that they are only worth fate points if they have teeth. The end of each mad-lib is the most important part:\n\nUnfortunately, [blank] would happen to you. Damn your luck.\n\nor\n\nThis goes wrong when [blank] happens.\n\nThat blank is the important part; it tells us what complication is happening.\n\nIf there are no complications, there are no fate points given out. With this in mind, only pay out if the situation gets more complicated because of the compel.\n\nCompels Pay Out To The Character(s) Affected\n\nMost of the time, only one character is affected by a compel, so only one character gets a fate point. There are times when the entire party can be compelled—it's almost always on an individual basis.\n\nFor example, if the entire party is in a room filled with knockout gas, you can compel them all to lose consciousness (this goes wrong when you're captured and put in an interrogation cell. Damn your luck). Each player can individually make the decision to accept or reject the compel, so some might succome whilst others don't.\n\nThere are very rare times when a group compel is all-or-nothing. If it comes up in your game, you'll know it when one player rejects the compel and the rest of the group say something like, \"well, how can I accept it then?\"\n\nCompels Only Pay Out When the Blank is Filled In\n\nRemember that if there are no teeth to the compel, no fate points are exchanged. If something would be nice to have happen but doesn't, it isn't a valid compel—often called a \"weaksauce compel.\" Fill in the blank, though, and you're good to go.\n\nOPs Two Examples\n\nCampaign-Level Aspects\n\nFor the most part The Great Convergence is Coming is a weaksauce compel to have the big bad show up. Just having the big bad show up is more of a plot device than a compel. Unless they are in the middle of something, and the big bad showing up makes it more complicated/interesting. In such a case, only the player who is affected by the complication gets the fate point. It's possible for it to be an all-or-nothing compel, but that's going to be rare.\n\nAllies\n\nJust because an ally is busy doesn't mean it's a compel. Again, it's more plot device. It's a compel if the lack of availability causes a complication. \"He would have been so useful right about now\" is a weaksauce compel. How does this make things more difficult for the PCs? If it doesn't—usually because the PCs can do what the NPC was going to do—then there is no compel."
