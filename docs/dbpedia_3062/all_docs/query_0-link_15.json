All patients with a qualifying POAF event, who decline randomization, will be offered the option of enrollment in a parallel registry that captures their baseline risk profile and their treatment strategy in terms of anticoagulants or antiplatelets received. These patients will also be asked to fill out a brief decliner survey.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nTo investigate the effect of graft sizing on valve performance in valve-sparing aortic root replacement for bicuspid aortic valve.In addition to a diseased control model, 3 representative groups-free-edge length to aortic/graft diameter (FELAD) ratio <1.3, 1.5 to 1.64, and >1.7-were replicated in explanted porcine aortic roots (n = 3) using straight grafts sized respective to the native free-edge length. They were run on a validated ex vivo univentricular system under physiological parameters for 20 cycles. All groups were tested within the same aortic root to minimize inter-root differences. Outcomes included transvalvular gradient, regurgitation fraction, and orifice area. Linear mixed effects model and pairwise comparisons were employed to compare outcomes across groups.The diseased control had mean transvalvular gradient 10.9 ± 6.30 mm Hg, regurgitation fraction 32.5 ± 4.91%, and orifice area 1.52 ± 0.12 cm2. In ex vivo analysis, all repair groups had improved regurgitation compared with control (P < .001). FELAD <1.3 had the greatest amount of regurgitation among the repair groups (P < .001) and 1.5-1.64 the least (P < .001). FELAD <1.3 and >1.7 exhibited greater mean gradient compared with both control and 1.5 to 1.64 (P < .001). Among the repair groups, 1.5 to 1.64 had the largest orifice area, and >1.7 the smallest (P < .001).For a symmetric bicuspid aortic valve, performance after valve-sparing aortic root replacement shows a bimodal distribution across graft size. As the FELAD ratio departs from 1.5 to 1.64 in either direction, significant increases in transvalvular gradient are observed. FELAD <1.3 may also result in suboptimal improvement of baseline regurgitation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjtc.2024.03.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 38899072\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11184666\n\nAbstract\n\nQuadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of four cusps instead of the usual three. It is estimated to occur in less than 0.05% of the population, with Type A (four equal-sized leaflets) accounting for roughly 30% of QAV subtypes. Based on limited clinical series, the usual presentation is progressive aortic valve regurgitation (AR) with symptoms occurring in the fourth to sixth decade of life. Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) and acute AR are very uncommon.We describe two cases of Type A QAV in patients who remained asymptomatic until their seventies with very uncommon presentations: one with severe AS and one with acute, severe AR and flail leaflet. In Case A, a 72-year-old patient with history of moderate AS presents to clinic with progressive exertional dyspnea. During work-up for transcatheter vs. surgical replacement pre-operative computed tomography angiogram (CTA) reveals a quadricuspid aortic valve with severe AS, and the patient undergoes surgical aortic valve replacement. Pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows good prosthetic valve function with no gradient or regurgitation. In Case B, a 76-year-old patient is intubated upon arrival to the hospital for acute desaturation, found to have wide open AR on catheterization, and transferred for emergent intervention. Intraoperative TEE reveals QAV with flail leaflet and severe AR. Repair is considered but deferred ultimately due to emergent nature. Post-operative TTE demonstrates good prosthetic valve function with no regurgitation and normal biventricular function.QAV can present as progressive severe AS and acute AR, with symptoms first occurring in the seventh decade of life. The optimal treatment for QAV remains uncertain. Although aortic valve repair or transcatheter option may be feasible in some patients, aortic valve replacement remains a tenable option.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13019-024-02696-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 38812010\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11134947\n\nAbstract\n\nPathogenic concepts of right ventricular (RV) failure in pulmonary arterial hypertension focus on a critical loss of microvasculature. However, the methods underpinning prior studies did not take into account the 3-dimensional (3D) aspects of cardiac tissue, making accurate quantification difficult. We applied deep-tissue imaging to the pressure-overloaded RV to uncover the 3D properties of the microvascular network and determine whether deficient microvascular adaptation contributes to RV failure.Heart sections measuring 250-µm-thick were obtained from mice after pulmonary artery banding (PAB) or debanding PAB surgery and properties of the RV microvascular network were assessed using 3D imaging and quantification. Human heart tissues harvested at the time of transplantation from pulmonary arterial hypertension cases were compared with tissues from control cases with normal RV function.Longitudinal 3D assessment of PAB mouse hearts uncovered complex microvascular remodeling characterized by tortuous, shorter, thicker, highly branched vessels, and overall preserved microvascular density. This remodeling process was reversible in debanding PAB mice in which the RV function recovers over time. The remodeled microvasculature tightly wrapped around the hypertrophied cardiomyocytes to maintain a stable contact surface to cardiomyocytes as an adaptation to RV pressure overload, even in end-stage RV failure. However, microvasculature-cardiomyocyte contact was impaired in areas with interstitial fibrosis where cardiomyocytes displayed signs of hypoxia. Similar to PAB animals, microvascular density in the RV was preserved in patients with end-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension, and microvascular architectural changes appeared to vary by etiology, with patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease displaying a lack of microvascular complexity with uniformly short segments.3D deep tissue imaging of the failing RV in PAB mice, pulmonary hypertension rats, and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension reveals complex microvascular changes to preserve the microvascular density and maintain a stable microvascular-cardiomyocyte contact. Our studies provide a novel framework to understand microvascular adaptation in the pressure-overloaded RV that focuses on cell-cell interaction and goes beyond the concept of capillary rarefaction.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323546\n\nView details for PubMedID 38770652\n\nAbstract\n\nVarious mitral repair techniques have been described. Though these repair techniques can be highly effective when performed correctly in suitable patients, limited quantitative biomechanical data are available. Validation and thorough biomechanical evaluation of these repair techniques from translational large animal in vivo studies in a standardized, translatable fashion are lacking. We sought to evaluate and validate biomechanical differences among different mitral repair techniques and further optimize repair operations using a large animal mitral valve prolapse model.Male Dorset sheep (n=20) had P2 chordae severed to create the mitral valve prolapse model. Fiber Bragg grating force sensors were implanted to measure chordal forces. Ten sheep underwent 3 randomized, paired mitral valve repair operations: neochord repair, nonresectional leaflet remodeling, and triangular resection. The other 10 sheep underwent neochord repair with 2, 4, and 6 neochordae. Data were collected at baseline, mitral valve prolapse, and after each repair.All mitral repair techniques successfully eliminated regurgitation. Compared with mitral valve prolapse (0.54±0.18 N), repair using neochord (0.37±0.20 N; P=0.02) and remodeling techniques (0.30±0.15 N; P=0.001) reduced secondary chordae peak force. Neochord repair further decreased primary chordae peak force (0.21±0.14 N) to baseline levels (0.20±0.17 N; P=0.83), and was associated with lower primary chordae peak force compared with the remodeling (0.34±0.18 N; P=0.02) and triangular resectional techniques (0.36±0.27 N; P=0.03). Specifically, repair using 2 neochordae resulted in higher peak primary chordal forces (0.28±0.21 N) compared with those using 4 (0.22±0.16 N; P=0.02) or 6 neochordae (0.19±0.16 N; P=0.002). No difference in peak primary chordal forces was observed between 4 and 6 neochordae (P=0.05). Peak forces on the neochordae were the lowest using 6 neochordae (0.09±0.11 N) compared with those of 4 neochordae (0.15±0.14 N; P=0.01) and 2 neochordae (0.29±0.18 N; P=0.001).Significant biomechanical differences were observed underlying different mitral repair techniques in a translational large animal model. Neochord repair was associated with the lowest primary chordae peak force compared to the remodeling and triangular resectional techniques. Additionally, neochord repair using at least 4 neochordae was associated with lower chordal forces on the primary chordae and the neochordae. This study provided key insights about mitral valve repair optimization and may further improve repair durability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.123.013196\n\nView details for PubMedID 38626077\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are a limited number of pharmacologic therapies for coronary artery disease, and few rodent models of occlusive coronary atherosclerosis and consequent myocardial infarction with which one can rapidly test new therapeutic approaches. Here, we characterize a novel, fertile, and easy-to-use HDL receptor (SR-B1)-based model of atherogenic diet-inducible, fatal coronary atherosclerosis, the SR-B1ΔCT/LDLR KO mouse. Additionally, we test intramyocardial injection of Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α), a potent angiogenic cytokine, as a possible therapy to rescue cardiac function in this mouse.SR-B1ΔCT/LDLR KO mice were fed the Paigen diet or standard chow diet, and we determined the effects of the diets on cardiac function, histology, and survival. After two weeks of feeding either the Paigen diet (n = 24) or standard chow diet (n = 20), the mice received an intramyocardial injection of either SDF-1α or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cardiac function and angiogenesis were assessed two weeks later.When six-week-old mice were fed the Paigen diet, they began to die as early as 19 days later and 50% had died by 38 days. None of the mice maintained on the standard chow diet died by day 72. Hearts from mice on the Paigen diet showed evidence of cardiomegaly, myocardial infarction, and occlusive coronary artery disease. For the five mice that survived until day 28 that underwent an intramyocardial injection of PBS on day 15, the average ejection fraction (EF) decreased significantly from day 14 (the day before injection, 52.1 ± 4.3%) to day 28 (13 days after the injection, 30.6 ± 6.8%) (paired t-test, n = 5, p = 0.0008). Of the 11 mice fed the Paigen diet and injected with SDF-1α on day 15, 8 (72.7%) survived to day 28. The average EF for these 8 mice increased significantly from 48.2 ± 7.2% on day 14 to63.6 ± 6.9% on day 28 (Paired t-test, n = 8, p = 0.003).This new mouse model and treatment with the promising angiogenic cytokine SDF-1α may lead to new therapeutic approaches for ischemic heart disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2024.117518\n\nView details for PubMedID 38627162\n\nAbstract\n\nThe use of ex vivo normothermic organ perfusion has enabled the use of deceased after circulatory death (DCD) donors for heart transplants. However, compared with conventional brain death donation, DCD heart transplantation performed with ex vivo organ perfusion involves an additional period of warm and cold ischemia, exposing the allograft to multiple bouts of ischemia reperfusion injury and may contribute to the high rates of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation usage after DCD heart transplantation.To assess whether the beating heart method of DCD heart transplantation is safe and whether it has an acceptable rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use postoperatively.This case series includes 10 patients with end-stage heart failure undergoing DCD heart transplantation at a single academic medical center from October 1, 2022, to August 3, 2023. Data were analyzed from October 2022 to August 2023.Using a beating heart method of implantation of the donor allograft.The main outcome was primary graft dysfunction necessitating postoperative initiation of mechanical circulatory support. Survival and initiation of mechanical circulatory support were secondary outcomes.In this case series, 10 consecutive patients underwent DCD heart transplantation via the beating heart method. Ten of 10 recipients were male (100%), the mean (SD) age was 51.2 (13.8) years, and 7 (70%) had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Ten patients (100%) survived, and 0 patients had initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation postoperatively. No other mechanical circulatory support, including intra-aortic balloon pump, was initiated postoperatively. Graft survival was 100% (10 of 10 patients), and, at the time of publication, no patients have been listed for retransplantation.In this study of 10 patients undergoing heart transplantation, the beating heart implantation method for DCD heart transplantation was safe and may mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury, which may lead to lower rates of primary graft dysfunction necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These results are relevant to institutions using DCD donors for heart transplantation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.1828\n\nView details for PubMedID 38466306\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate survival for combined heart-lung transplant (HLTx) recipients across four decades at a single institution. We aim to summarize our contemporary practice based upon more than 271 HLTx over 40 years.METHODS: Data were collected from a departmental database and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Recipients <18y, those undergoing redo HLTx , or triple-organ system transplantation were excluded, leaving 271 patients for analysis. The Pioneering Era was defined by date of transplant between 1981-2000 (N=155), and the Modern Era between 2001-2022 (N=116). Survival analysis was performed using cardinality matching of populations based on donor and recipient age, donor and recipient sex, ischemic time, and sex-matching.RESULTS: Between 1981-2022, 271 HLTx were performed at a single institution. Recipients in the Modern Era were older (42 vs 34y, P<0.001) and had shorter waitlist times (78 vs 234d, P<0.001). Allografts from female donors were more common in the Modern Era (59% vs 39%, P=0.002). In the matched survival analysis, 30-day survival (97% vs 84%, P=0.005), 1-year survival (89% vs 77%, P=0.041), and 10-year survival (53% vs 26%, P=0.012) significantly improved in the Modern Era relative to the Pioneering Era, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival in HLTx is achievable with institutional experience and may continue to improve in the coming decades. Advances in mechanical circulatory support, improved maintenance immunosuppression, and early recognition and management of acute complications such as primary graft dysfunction and acute rejection have dramatically improved the prognosis for HLTx recipients in our contemporary institutional experience.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2024.01.042\n\nView details for PubMedID 38320627\n\nAbstract\n\nThe use of rapid-deployment valves (RDVs) has been shown to reduce the operative time for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Long-term core laboratory-adjudicated data are scarce, however. Here we report final 7-year data on RDV use.TRANSFORM was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, single-arm trial implanting a stented bovine pericardial valve with an incorporated balloon-expandable sealing frame. A prior published 1-year analysis included 839 patients from 29 centers. An additional 46 patients were enrolled and implanted, for a total of 885 patients. Annual clinical and core laboratory-adjudicated echocardiographic outcomes were collected through 8 years. Primary endpoints were structural valve deterioration (SVD), all-cause reintervention, all-cause valve explantation, and all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamic performance assessed by echocardiography. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.0 ± 2.0 years.The mean patient age was 73.3 ± 8.2 years. Isolated AVR was performed in 62.1% of the patients, and AVR with concomitant procedures was performed in 37.9%. Freedom from all-cause mortality at 7 years was 76.0% for isolated AVR and 68.2% for concomitant AVR. Freedom from SVD, all-cause reintervention, and valve explantation at 7 years was 97.5%, 95.7%, and 97.8%, respectively. The mean gradient and effective orifice area at 7 years were 11.1 ± 5.3 mm Hg and 1.6 ± 0.3 cm2, respectively. Paravalvular leak at 7 years was none/trace in 88.6% and mild in 11.4%. In patients undergoing isolated AVR, the cumulative probability of pacemaker implantation was 13.9% at 30 days, 15.5% at 1 year, and 21.8% at 7 years.AVR for aortic stenosis using an RDV is associated with low rates of late adverse events. This surgical pericardial tissue platform provides excellent and stable hemodynamic performance through 7 years.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2023.10.034\n\nView details for PubMedID 38420551\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10897657\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: Artificial neochordae implantation is commonly used for mitral valve (MV) repair. However, neochordae length estimation can be difficult to perform. The objective was to assess the impact of neochordae length changes on MV haemodynamics and neochordal forces.METHODS: Porcine MVs (n=6) were implanted in an ex vivo left heart simulator. MV prolapse (MVP) was generated by excising at least 2 native primary chordae supporting the P2 segments from each papillary muscle. Two neochordae anchored on each papillary muscle were placed with one tied to the native chord length (exact length) and the other tied with variable lengths from 2x to 0.5x of the native length (variable length). Haemodynamics, neochordal forces, and echocardiography data were collected.RESULTS: Neochord implantation repair successfully eliminated mitral regurgitation with repaired regurgitant fractions of approximately 4% regardless of neochord length (p<0.01). Leaflet coaptation height also significantly improved to a minimum height of 1.3cm compared with that of MVP (0.9±0.4cm, p<0.05). Peak and average forces on exact length neochordae increased as variable length neochordae lengths increased. Peak and average forces on the variable length neochordae increased with shortened lengths. Overall, chordal forces appeared to vary more drastically in variable length neochordae compared with exact length neochordae.CONCLUSIONS: MV regurgitation was eliminated with neochordal repair, regardless of the neochord length. However, chordal forces varied significantly with different neochord lengths, with a preferentially greater impact on the variable length neochord. Further validation studies may be performed before translating to clinical practices.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ejcts/ezae008\n\nView details for PubMedID 38258541\n\nAbstract\n\nThe valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) procedure was developed to preserve the aortic valve apparatus to replace aneurysmal aortic roots with synthetic grafts and to eliminate associated aortic regurgitation (AR). However, residual post-repair AR is not uncommon and has been found to be associated with recurrent AR and future reoperation.We designed and manufactured a 3D-printed, external adjustable symmetrically extensible (EASE) aortic annuloplasty ring that can symmetrically reduce the aortic annulus diameter via a radial constriction, compliant mechanism. An ex vivo porcine VSARR model with annular dilation and AR was developed (n = 4) and used for hemodynamic, echocardiography, and high-speed videography data collection.After ring annuloplasty repair using the EASE aortic ring, the regurgitant fraction decreased from 23.6 ± 6.9% from the VSARR model to 7.4 ± 5.6% (p = 0.05), which was similar to that measured from baseline with a regurgitant fraction of 10.2 ± 3.9% (p = 0.34). The leaflet coaptation height after annuloplasty repair also significantly increased from that measured in VSARR model (0.4 ± 0.1 cm) to 0.9 ± 0.1 cm (p = 0.0004), a level similar to that measured in baseline (1.1 ± 0.1 cm, p = 0.28).Using an ex vivo VSARR model, the EASE ring successfully reduced AR by reducing the annular diameter and improving leaflet coaptation. With its broad applicability and ease of use, this device has the potential to have a significant impact on patients suffering worldwide from AR due to root aneurysms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s13239-024-00709-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 38238600\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 6562077\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: The intensivist-led cardiovascular intensive care unit model is the standard of care in cardiac surgery. This study examines whether a cardiovascular intensive care unit model that uses operating cardiac surgeons, cardiothoracic surgery residents, and advanced practice providers is associated with comparable outcomes.Methods: This is a single-institution review of the first 400 cardiac surgery patients admitted to an operating surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit from 2020 to 2022. Inclusion criteria are elective status and operations managed by both cardiovascular intensive care unit models (aortic operations, valve operations, coronary operations, septal myectomy). Patients from the surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit were exact matched by operation type and 1:1 propensity score matched with controls from the traditional cardiovascular intensive care unit using a logistic regression model that included age, sex, preoperative mortality risk, incision type, and use of cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest. Primary outcome was total postoperative length of stay. Secondary outcomes included postoperative intensive care unit length of stay, 30-day mortality, 30-day Society of Thoracic Surgeons-defined morbidity (permanent stroke, renal failure, cardiac reoperation, prolonged intubation, deep sternal infection), packed red cell transfusions, and vasopressor use. Outcomes between the 2 groups were compared using chi-square, Fisher exact test, or 2-sample t test as appropriate.Results: A total of 400 patients from the surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit (mean age 61.2±12.8years, 131 female patients [33%], 346 patients [86.5%] with European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II <2%) and their matched controls were included. The most common operations across both units were coronary artery bypass grafting (n=318, 39.8%) and mitral valve repair or replacement (n=238, 29.8%). Approximately half of the operations were performed via sternotomy (n=462, 57.8%). There were 3 (0.2%) in-hospital deaths, and 47 patients (5.9%) had a 30-day complication. The total length of stay was significantly shorter for the surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit patients (6.3 vs 7.0days, P=.028), and intensive care unit length of stay trended in the same direction (2.5 vs 2.9days, P=.16). Intensive care unit readmission rates, 30-day mortality, and 30-day morbidity were not significantly different between cardiovascular intensive care unit models. The surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit was associated with fewer postoperative red blood cell transfusions in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (P=.002) and decreased vasopressor use (P=.001).Conclusions: In its first 2years, the surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit demonstrated comparable outcomes to the traditional cardiovascular intensive care unit with significant improvements in total length of stay, postoperative transfusions in the cardiovascular intensive care unit, and vasopressor use. This early success exemplifies how an operating surgeon-led cardiovascular intensive care unit can provide similar outcomes to the standard-of-care model for patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2023.09.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 38204639\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The functional SYNTAX score (FSS), which incorporates functional information as assessed by fractional flow reserve (FFR), is a better predictor of outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with less complex coronary artery disease (CAD).OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the prognostic value of the FSS in patients with complex CAD eligible for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).METHODS: The FAME 3 (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 3) trial compared FFR-guided PCI with CABG in patients with angiographic 3-vessel CAD. In this prespecified substudy, the angiographic core laboratory calculated the SYNTAX score (SS) and then the FSS by eliminating lesions that were not significant based on FFR. Outcomes in the PCI patients based on the FSS and the SS were compared to each other and to the patients treated with CABG.RESULTS: The FSS reclassified more than one-quarter of patients from an SS >22 to an FSS≤22. In the 50% of PCI patients who had an FSS≤22, the primary endpoint occurred at a similar rate to patients treated with CABG (P = 0.77). The primary endpoint in patients without functionally significant 3-vessel CAD was similar to the CABG group (P = 0.97). The rate of myocardial infarction and revascularization among all deferred lesions was 0.5% and 3.2%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: By measuring the FSS, one can identify 50% of patients who have a similar outcome at 1 year with PCIcompared with CABG. Lesions deferred from PCI based on FFR have a low event rate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jcin.2023.06.023\n\nView details for PubMedID 37704297\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study aimed to biomechanically evaluate the force profiles on the anterior primary and secondary chordae after neochord repair for anterior valve prolapse with varied degrees of residual mitral regurgitation using an ex vivo heart simulator.The experiment used 8 healthy porcine mitral valves. Chordal forces were measured using fiber Bragg grating sensors on primary and secondary chordae from A2 segments. The anterior valve prolapse model was generated by excising 2 primary chordae at the A2 segment. Neochord repair was performed with 2 pairs of neochords. Varying neochord lengths simulated postrepair residual mitral regurgitation with regurgitant fraction at >30% (moderate), 10% to 30% (mild), and <10% (perfect repair).Regurgitant fractions of baseline, moderate, mild, and perfect repair were 4.7% ± 0.8%, 35.8% ± 2.1%, 19.8% ± 2.0%, and 6.0% ± 0.7%, respectively (P < .001). Moderate had a greater peak force of the anterior primary chordae (0.43 ± 0.06 N) than those of baseline (0.19 ± 0.04 N; P = .011), mild (0.23 ± 0.05 N; P = .041), and perfect repair (0.21 ± 0.03 N; P = .006). In addition, moderate had a greater peak force of the anterior secondary chordae (1.67 ± 0.17 N) than those of baseline (0.64 ± 0.13 N; P = .003), mild (0.84 ± 0.24 N; P = .019), and perfect repair (0.68 ± 0.14 N; P = .001). No significant differences in peak and average forces on both primary and secondary anterior chordae were observed between the baseline and perfect repair as well as the mild and perfect repair.Moderate residual mitral regurgitation after neochord repair was associated with increased anterior primary and secondary chordae forces in our ex vivo anterior valve prolapse model. This difference in chordal force profile may influence long-term repair durability, providing biomechanical evidence in support of obtaining minimal regurgitation when repairing mitral anterior valve prolapse.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2023.04.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 37808060\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10556825\n\nAbstract\n\nPrevious studies comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with multivessel coronary disease not involving the left main have shown significantly lower rates of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke after CABG. These studies did not routinely use current-generation drug-eluting stents or fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide PCI.FAME 3 (Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, international, randomized trial involving patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease (not involving the left main coronary artery) in 48 centers worldwide. Patients were randomly assigned to receive FFR-guided PCI using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents or CABG. The prespecified key secondary end point of the trial reported here is the 3-year incidence of the composite of death, MI, or stroke.A total of 1500 patients were randomized to FFR-guided PCI or CABG. Follow-up was achieved in >96% of patients in both groups. There was no difference in the incidence of the composite of death, MI, or stroke after FFR-guided PCI compared with CABG (12.0% versus 9.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.3 [95% CI, 0.98-1.83]; P=0.07). The rates of death (4.1% versus 3.9%; HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6-1.7]; P=0.88) and stroke (1.6% versus 2.0%; HR, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4-1.7]; P=0.56) were not different. MI occurred more frequently after PCI (7.0% versus 4.2%; HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]; P=0.02).At 3-year follow-up, there was no difference in the incidence of the composite of death, MI, or stroke after FFR-guided PCI with current-generation drug-eluting stents compared with CABG. There was a higher incidence of MI after PCI compared with CABG, with no difference in death or stroke. These results provide contemporary data to allow improved shared decision-making between physicians and patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease.URL: https://www.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02100722.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065770\n\nView details for PubMedID 37602376\n\nAbstract\n\nAn increasing number of high-risk patients with previous mitral valve annuloplasty require transcatheter mitral valve replacement due to recurrent regurgitation. Annulus dilation with a transcatheter balloon is often performed before valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement, which is believed to reduce misalignment and paravalvular leakage, yet little evidence exists to support this practice. Our objective was to generate intuitive annuloplasty ring analyses for improved valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement planning.We generated a mathematical model that calculates image-tracked differential ring curvature to build quantifications for improved planning for valve-in-ring procedures. Carpentier-Edwards Physio M24 and M30 (n = 2 each), Physio II M24 and M26 (n = 3 each), LivaNova AnnuloFlex M26 (n = 2), and Edwards Geoform M28 (n = 2) rings were tested with a 30-mm Toray Inoue balloon inflated to maximum rated pressures.Curvature variance reduces with larger ring sizes, indicating that larger rings are initially more circular than smaller ones. Evaluated semi-rigid and rigid rings showed little to no difference between pre- and post-dilation states. Annuloflex rings (flexible band) showed a postdilation variance reduction of 32.83% (P < .001) followed by an increase after 10 minutes of relaxation that was still reduced by 19.62% relative to the initial state (P < .001).We discovered that balloon dilation does not significantly deform evaluated semi-rigid or rigid rings at maximum rated balloon pressures. This may mean that dilation for these conditions before valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement is unnecessary. Our mathematical approach creates a foundation for extended classification of this practice, providing meaningful quantification of ring geometry.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjtc.2023.03.022\n\nView details for PubMedID 37555034\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10405166\n\nAbstract\n\nSeveral conduit configurations, such as straight graft (SG), Valsalva graft (VG), anticommissural plication (ACP), and the Stanford modification (SMOD) technique, have been described for the valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) procedure. Prior ex vivo studies have evaluated the impact of conduit configurations on root biomechanics, but the mock coronary artery circuits used could not replicate the physical properties of native coronary arteries. Moreover, the individual leaflet's biomechanics, including the fluttering phenomenon, were unclear.Porcine aortic roots with coronary arteries were explanted (n=5) and underwent VSARR using SG, VG, ACP, and SMOD for evaluation in an ex vivo left heart flow loop simulator. Additionally, 762 patients who underwent VSARR from 1993 through 2022 at our center were retrospectively reviewed. Analysis of variance was performed to evaluate differences between different conduit configurations, with post hoc Tukey's correction for pairwise testing.SG demonstrated lower rapid leaflet opening velocity compared with VG (P=0.001) and SMOD (P=0.045) in the left coronary cusp (LCC), lower rapid leaflet closing velocity compared with VG (P=0.04) in the right coronary cusp (RCC), and lower relative opening force compared with ACP (P=0.04) in the RCC. The flutter frequency was lower in baseline compared with VG (P=0.02) and in VG compared with ACP (P=0.03) in the LCC. Left coronary artery mean flow was higher in SG compared with SMOD (P=0.02) and ACP (P=0.05). Clinically, operations using SG compared with sinus-containing graft was associated with shorter aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time (P<0.001, <0.001).SG demonstrated hemodynamics and biomechanics most closely recapitulating those from the native root with significantly shorter intraoperative times compared with repair using sinus-containing graft. Future in vivo validation studies as well as correlation with comprehensive, comparative clinical study outcomes may provide additional invaluable insights regarding strategies to further enhance repair durability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.21037/acs-2023-avs2-0068\n\nView details for PubMedID 37554719\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10405339\n\nAbstract\n\nLoeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) patients demonstrate heightened risk of distal thoracic aortic events after valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR). This study assesses the clinical risks and hemodynamic consequences of a prophylactic aortic arch replacement strategy in LDS and characterizes smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype in LDS aneurysmal and normal-sized downstream aorta.Patients with genetically confirmed LDS (n=8) underwent prophylactic aortic arch replacement during VSARR. 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed in n=4 LDS patients (VSARR+arch) and compared with both contemporary Marfan syndrome patients (VSARR only, n=5) and control patients (without aortopathy, n=5). Aortic tissues from n=4 LDS patients and n=2 organ donors were processed for anatomically segmented single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and histologic assessment.LDS VSARR+arch patients had no deaths, major morbidity, or aortic events in median 2.00 years follow-up. 4D-MRI demonstrated altered flow parameters in post-operative aortopathy patients relative to controls, but no clear deleterious changes attributable to arch replacement. Integrated analysis of aortic scRNAseq data (>49,000 cells) identified a continuum of abnormal SMC phenotypic modulation in LDS defined by reduced contractility and enriched extracellular matrix synthesis, adhesion receptors, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling. These 'modulated SMCs' populated the LDS tunica media with gradually reduced density from the overtly aneurysmal root to the non-dilated arch.LDS patients demonstrated excellent surgical outcomes without overt downstream flow or shear stress disturbances after concomitant VSARR+arch operations. Abnormal SMC-mediated aortic remodeling occurs within the normal diameter, clinically at-risk LDS arch segment. These initial clinical and pathophysiologic findings support concomitant arch replacement in LDS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2023.07.023\n\nView details for PubMedID 37500053\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Both combined heart-kidney transplantation and ventricular assist devices (VADs) pose significant challenges, including sensitization, immunosuppressive treatment, and infrastructure demands. Despite these challenges, we hypothesized that the recipients of combined heart-kidney transplants with and without VADs would have equivalent survival. We aimed to compare the survival of heart-kidney transplant recipients with and without prior VAD placement.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients enrolled in the United Network for Organ Sharing database who underwent heart-kidney transplants. We created a matched cohort of patients undergoing heart-kidney transplantation with or without prior VAD using 1:1 nearest propensity-score matching with preoperative variables.RESULTS: In the propensity-matched cohort, 399 patients underwent heart-kidney transplantation with prior VAD, and 399 underwent heart-kidney transplantation without prior VAD. The estimated survival of heart--kidney recipients with prior VAD was 84.8% at one year, 81.2% at 3 years, and 75.3% at 5 years. The estimated survival of heart-kidney recipients without prior VAD was 86.8.7% at one year, 84.0% at 3 years, and 78.8% at 5 years. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival of heart-kidney transplant recipients with or without prior VAD at one year (P=.42; Figure 2), 3 years (P=.34), or 5 years (P=.30).CONCLUSION: Despite the increased challenge of heart-kidney transplantation in recipients with prior VAD, we demonstrated that these patients have similar survival to those who underwent heart-kidney transplantation without previous VAD placement.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.transproceed.2023.04.037\n\nView details for PubMedID 37393169\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Collateral arteries act as natural bypasses which reroute blood flow to ischemic regions and facilitate tissue regeneration. In an injured heart, neonatal artery endothelial cells orchestrate a systematic series of cellular events, which includes their outward migration, proliferation, and coalescence into fully functional collateral arteries. This process, called artery reassembly, aids complete cardiac regeneration in neonatal hearts but is absent in adults. The reason for this age-dependent disparity in artery cell response is completely unknown. In this study, we investigated if regenerative potential of coronary arteries is dictated by their ability to dedifferentiate.METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing of coronary endothelial cells was performed to identify differences in molecular profiles of neonatal and adult endothelial cells in mice. Findings from this in silico analyses were confirmed with in vivo experiments using genetic lineage tracing, whole organ immunostaining, confocal imaging, and cardiac functional assays in mice.RESULTS: Upon coronary occlusion, neonates showed a significant increase in actively cycling artery cells and expressed prominent dedifferentiation markers. Data from in silico pathway analyses and in vivo experiments suggested that upon myocardial infarction, cell cycle reentry of preexisting neonatal artery cells, the subsequent collateral artery formation, and recovery of cardiac function are dependent on arterial VegfR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2). This subpopulation of dedifferentiated and proliferating artery cells was absent in nonregenerative postnatal day 7 or adult hearts.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that adult artery endothelial cells fail to drive collateral artery development due to their limited ability to dedifferentiate and proliferate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.319319\n\nView details for PubMedID 37345524\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: Although bioprosthetic valves have excellent hemodynamic properties and can eliminate the need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy, these devices are associated with high rates of reoperation and limited durability. Although there are many distinct bioprosthesis designs, all bioprosthetic valves have historically featured a trileaflet pattern. This in silico study examines the biomechanical effect of modulating the number of leaflets in a bioprosthetic valve.Methods: Bioprosthetic valves with 2 to 6 leaflets were designed in Fusion 360 using quadratic spline geometry. Leaflets were modeled with standard mechanical parameters for fixed bovine pericardial tissue. A mesh of each design was structurally evaluated using finite element analysis software Abaqus CAE. Maximum von Mises stresses during valve closure were assessed for each leaflet geometry in both the aortic and mitral position.Results: Computational analysis demonstrated that increasing the number of leaflets is associated with reduction in leaflet stresses. Compared with the standard trileaflet design, a quadrileaflet pattern reduces leaflet maximum von Mises stresses by 36% in the aortic position and 38% in the mitral position. Maximum stress was inversely proportional to the square of the leaflet quantity. Surface area increased linearly and central leakage increased quadratically with leaflet quantity.Conclusions: A quadrileaflet pattern was found to reduce leaflet stresses while limiting increases in central leakage and surface area. These findings suggest that modulating the number of leaflets can allow for optimization of the current bioprosthetic valve design, which may translate to more durable valve replacement bioprostheses.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2023.04.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 37425479\n\nAbstract\n\nEstimating neochord lengths during mitral valve (MV) repair is challenging, as approximation must be performed largely based on intuition and surgical experience. Little data exist on quantifying the effects of neochord length misestimation. We aimed to evaluate the impact of neochord length on papillary muscle (PM) forces and MV hemodynamics, which is especially pertinent as increased forces have been linked to aberrant MV biomechanics.Porcine MVs (n=8) were mounted in an ex vivo heart simulator, and PMs were fixed to high resolution strain gauges, while hemodynamic data were recorded. We used an adjustable system to modulate neochord lengths. Optimal length was qualitatively verified by a single experienced operator, and neochordae were randomly lengthened or shortened in 1 mm increments up to ±5 mm from the optimal length.Optimal length neochordae resulted in the lowest peak composite PM forces (6.94±0.29 N), significantly different from all lengths >±1 mm. Both longer and shorter neochordae increased forces linearly according to difference from optimal length. Both peak PM forces and MR scaled more aggressively for longer versus shorter neochordae by factors of 1.6 and 6.9, respectively.Leveraging precision ex vivo heart simulation, we found that millimeter-level neochord length differences can result in significant differences in PM forces and MR, thereby altering valvular biomechanics. Differences in lengthened versus shortened neochordae scaling of forces and MR may indicate different levels of biomechanical tolerance towards longer and shorter neochordae. Our findings highlight the need for more thorough biomechanical understanding of neochordal MV repair.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2023.04.026\n\nView details for PubMedID 37160219\n\nAbstract\n\nSingle ventricle physiology (SVP) is used to describe any congenital heart lesion that is unable to support independent pulmonary and systemic circulations. Current treatment strategies rely on a series of palliation surgeries that culminate in the Fontan physiology, which relies on the single functioning ventricle to provide systemic circulation while passively routing venous return through the pulmonary circulation. Despite significant reductions in early mortality, the presence of atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation is a key predictor of heart failure in these patients. We sought to evaluate the biomechanical changes associated with the AVV in SVP physiologies. Left and right ventricles were sutured onto patient-derived 3D-printed mounts and mounted into an ex vivo systemic heart simulator capable of reproducing Norwood, Glenn, Fontan and Late Fontan physiologies. We found that the tricuspid anterior leaflet experienced elevated maximum force, average force, and maximum yank compared to the posterior and septal leaflets. Between physiologies, maximum yank was greatest in the Norwood physiology relative to the Glenn, Fontan, and Late Fontan physiologies. These contrasting trends suggest that long- and short-term mechanics of AVV failure in single ventricle differ and that AVV interventions should account for asymmetries in force profiles between leaflets and physiologies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10439-023-03178-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 36966247\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 5371563\n\nAbstract\n\nCardiovascular disease, primarily caused by coronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States. While standard clinical interventions have improved patient outcomes, mortality rates associated with eventual heart failure still represent a clinical challenge. Macrorevascularization techniques inadequately address the microvascular perfusion deficits that persist beyond primary and secondary interventions. In this work, we investigate a photosynthetic oxygen delivery system that rescues the myocardium following acute ischemia. Using a simple microfluidic system, we encapsulated Synechococcus elongatus into alginate hydrogel microparticles (HMPs), which photosynthetically deliver oxygen to ischemic tissue in the absence of blood flow. We demonstrate that HMPs improve the viability of S. elongatus during the injection process and allow for simple oxygen diffusion. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 45) underwent sham surgery, acute ischemia reperfusion surgery, or a chronic ischemia reperfusion surgery, followed by injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), S. elongatus suspended in PBS, HMPs, or S. elongatus encapsulated in HMPs. Treatment with S. elongatus-HMPs mitigated cellular apoptosis and improved left ventricular function. Thus, delivery of S. elongatus encapsulated in HMPs improves clinical translation by utilizing a minimally invasive delivery platform that improves S. elongatus viability and enhances the therapeutic benefit of a novel photosynthetic system for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2023.03.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36966053\n\nAbstract\n\nTo evaluate the effect of perioperative allogeneic packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during aortic root replacement.We reviewed patients undergoing aortic root replacement at our institution between March 2014 and April 2020. In total, 760 patients underwent aortic root replacement, of whom 442 (58%) received a perioperative RBC transfusion. Propensity score matching was used to account for baseline and operative differences resulting in 159 matched pairs. All-cause mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Data were obtained from our institutional Society of Thoracic Surgeons database and chart review.After propensity score matching, the RBC-transfused and -nontransfused groups were similar for all preoperative characteristics. Cardiopulmonary bypass time, crossclamp time, and lowest operative temperature were similar between the transfused and nontransfused groups (standardized mean difference <0.05). RBC transfusion was associated with more frequent postoperative ventilation greater than 24 hours (36/159 [23%] vs 19/159 [12%]; P = .01), postoperative hemodialysis (9/159 [5.7%] vs 0/159 [0%]; P = .003), reoperation for mediastinal hemorrhage (9/159 [5.7%] vs 0/159 [0%]; P = .003), and longer intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (3 vs 2 days and 8 vs 6 days respectively; P < .001). Thirty-day operative mortality after propensity score matching was similar between the cohorts (1.9%; 3/159 vs 0%; P = .2), and 5-year survival was reduced in the RBC transfusion cohort (90.2% [95% confidence interval, 84.1%-96.7%] vs 97.1% [95% confidence interval, 92.3%-100%] P = .035).Aortic root replacement frequently requires RBC transfusion during and after the operation, but even after matching for observed preoperative and operative characteristics, RBC transfusion is associated with more frequent postoperative complications and reduced midterm survival.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2023.01.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 37063152\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10091283\n\nAbstract\n\nContemporary series of aortic arch replacement at the time of aortic root surgery are limited in number of patients and mostly address hemiarch replacement. We describe outcomes after aortic root and concomitant arch replacement, including total arch replacement.This single-institution retrospective review studied 1196 consecutive patients from May 2004 to September 2020 who underwent first-time aortic root replacement. Patients undergoing surgery for endocarditis were excluded (n = 68, 5.7%). Patients undergoing concomitant root and arch replacement were propensity matched with patients undergoing isolated root surgery based on indication, clinical and operative characteristics, demographics, medical history including connective tissue disorders, and urgency. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression modeling were used to assess the primary outcome of all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes of prolonged ventilator use, postoperative blood transfusion, and debilitating stroke, adjusted for patient and operative characteristics.Among the 1128 patients who underwent aortic root intervention during the study period, 471 (41.8%) underwent concomitant aortic arch replacement. Most underwent hemiarch replacement (n = 411, 87.4%); 59 patients (12.6%) underwent total arch replacement (with elephant trunk: n = 23, 4.9%; without elephant trunk: n = 36, 7.7%). The mean follow-up time was 4.6 years postprocedure. Operative mortality was 2.2%, and total mortality over the entire study period was 9.2%. Propensity matching generated 348 matches (295 concomitant hemiarch, 53 concomitant total arch). Concomitant hemiarch (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.86, P = .99) and total arch replacement (hazard ratio, 1.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.72-3.57, P = .24) were not significantly associated with increased mortality. Rates of stroke were not significantly different among each group: isolated root (n = 11/348, 3.7%), root + hemiarch (n = 17/295, 5.8%), and root + total arch (n = 3/53, 5.7%) replacement (P = .50), nor was the adjusted risk of stroke. Both concomitant arch interventions were associated with prolonged ventilator use and use of postoperative blood transfusions.Hemiarch and total arch replacement are safe to perform at the time of aortic root intervention, with no significant differences in survival or stroke rates, but increased ventilator and blood product use.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2022.12.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 37063158\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10091289\n\nAbstract\n\nCentral venous catheters (CVCs) are often trimmed during heart transplantation and pediatric cardiac surgery. However, the risk of endothelial injury caused by the cut tip of the CVC has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that there is no difference in the degree of endothelial injury associated with trimmed CVCs versus standard untrimmed CVCs.In four adult male sheep, the left external jugular vein was exposed in three segments, one designated for an untouched control group, one for the trimmed CVC group, and one for the untrimmed CVC group. Trimmed and untrimmed CVC tips were rotated circumferentially within their respective segments to abrade the lumen of the vein. The vein samples were explanted, and two representative sections from each sample were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, as well as with immunohistochemistry against CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and caveolin. Higher immunohistochemical stain distributions and intensities are associated with normal health and function of the venous endothelium. Data are presented as counts with percentages or as means with standard error.H&E staining revealed no evidence of endothelial injury in 6/8 (75%) samples from the untouched control group, and no injury in 4/8 (50%) samples from both the trimmed and untrimmed CVC groups (p = 0.504). In all remaining samples from each group, only mild endothelial injury was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis comparing trimmed CVCs versus untrimmed CVCs revealed no difference in the percentage of endothelial cells staining positive for CD31 (57.5% ± 7.2% vs 55.0% ± 9.2%, p = 0.982), vWF (73.8% ± 8.0% vs 62.5% ± 9.6%, p = 0.579), eNOS (66.3% ± 4.2% vs 63.8% ± 7.5%, p = 0.962), and caveolin (53.8% ± 5.0% vs 51.3% ± 4.4%, p = 0.922). There were no significant differences between the groups in the distributions of stain intensity for CD31, vWF, eNOS, and caveolin.Trimmed CVCs do not increase endothelial injury compared to standard untrimmed CVCs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/11297298231153716\n\nView details for PubMedID 36765464\n\nAbstract\n\nLimited aortic root repair for acute type A dissection is associated with greater risk of proximal reoperations compared to full aortic root replacement. Surgical outcomes for patients undergoing reoperative root replacement after previous dissection repair are unknown. This study seeks to determine outcomes for these patients to further inform the debate surrounding optimal upfront management of the aortic root in acute dissection. Retrospective record review of all patients who underwent full aortic root replacement after a previous type A dissection repair operation at a tertiary academic referral center from 2004-2020 was performed. Among 57 cases of reoperative root replacement after type A repair, 35 cases included concomitant aortic arch replacements, and 21 cases involved coronary reconstruction (unilateral or bilateral modified Cabrol grafts). There were 3 acute post-operative strokes and 4 operative mortalities (composite 30-day and in-hospital deaths, 7.0%) . Mid-term outcomes were equivalent for patients who required arch replacement compared to isolated proximal repairs (81.8% vs. 80.6% estimated 5-year survival, median follow-up 5.53 years. Reoperative root replacement after index type A dissection repairs, including those with concomitant aortic arch replacement and/or coronary reconstruction is achievable with acceptable outcomes at an experienced aortic center.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2023.02.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36758660\n\nAbstract\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) bioprinting demonstrates technology capable of producing structures comparable to native tissues in the human body. The Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) technique involves hydrogel-based bio-inks printed within a thermo-reversible support bath to provide mechanical strength to the printed construct. Smaller and more uniform microsphere sizes of FRESH were reported to aid in enhancing printing resolution and construct accuracy. Therefore, we sought to optimize the FRESH generation protocol, particularly by varying stir speed and stir duration, in hopes to further improve microsphere size and uniformity. We observed optimal conditions at a stir speed of 600 rpm and stir duration for 20 hours that generated the smallest microspheres with the best uniformity. Comparison of using the optimized FRESH to the commercial FRESH LifeSupport to bioprint single filament and geometrical constructs revealed reduced single filament diameters and higher angular precision in the optimized FRESH bio-printed constructs compared to those printed in the commercial FRESH. Overall, our refinement of the FRESH manufacturing protocol represents an important step toward enhancing 3D bioprinting resolution and construct fidelity. Improving such technologies allows for the fabrication of highly accurate constructs with anatomical properties similar to native counterparts.

Using a national transplant database, this study evaluated the transplant rate, waitlist mortality, waiting time, and other outcomes of en-bloc heart-lung transplantation recipients. Adult patients registered on the national database for heart-lung transplants before and after the policy update were selected as cohorts. Baseline characteristics, transplant rates, waitlist mortality, waiting times, and other outcomes were compared between the two periods. In total, 370 patients were registered for heart-lung transplants during the pre- and post-periods. There were significantly higher transplant rates, shorter waitlist times, and substantially reduced waitlist mortality in the post-period. Registered patients waitlisted in the post-period had significantly higher utilization of intra-aortic balloon pumps, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and overall life support, including ventricular assist devices. Transplant recipients had significantly longer ischemic times, increased transport distances, and shorter waiting times before transplantation in the post-policy period. Transplant recipients held similar short-term survival before and after the policy change (log-rank test, p = 0.4357). Therefore, the revised policy significantly improved access to en-bloc heart-lung allografts compared with the prior policy, with better waitlist outcomes and similar post-transplant outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/ti.2023.11956\n\nView details for PubMedID 38152546\n\nAbstract\n\nTreatment approach to type A aortic dissection with malperfusion, immediate open aortic repair versus upfront endovascular treatment, remains controversial. From January 2017 to July 2021, 301 consecutive type A repairs were evaluated at our institution. Starting in 2019, all type A aortic dissections were performed in a fixed-fluoroscopy, hybrid operating room. Propensity score matching was used to control baseline patient characteristics between traditional and hybrid operating room approaches. There were 144 patients in the traditional group and 157 in the hybrid group. In the hybrid group, 41% (64/157) underwent intraoperative angiograms, and of those, 58% (37/64) received at least one endovascular intervention. Following propensity matching, 125 patients remained in each the traditional and hybrid groups. Thirty-day survival was significantly improved in the hybrid cohort at 96.7%% (122/125) as compared to the traditional cohort at 87.2% (109/125) (p=0.002). There were no significant differences in perioperative paralysis (1.6% vs. 1.6%, p>0.9), new hemodialysis (12% vs. 9.6%, p=0.5), fasciotomy (2.4% vs. 5.6%, p=0.20, and exploratory laparotomy (1.6% vs. 4.8%, p=0.3). The hybrid operating room approach to type A aortic dissection, provides the ability to immediately assess distal malperfusion and perform endovascular interventions at the time of open aortic repair, and is associated with significantly higher 30-day and 2-year survival when compared to a stepwise repair approach in a traditional operating room.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2022.12.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 36567047\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Surgical management of severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) presents a challenging problem for even the most experienced surgeons. Preoperative planning is the most effective strategy to mitigate risk in these scenarios. MAC alone should not disqualify a patient from consideration for mitral valve repair, although the presence of concurrent greater than moderate stenosis warrants consideration of mitral valve replacement.METHODS: While repair and replacement techniques for mitral regurgitation in the setting of MAC overlap with those used to repair a non-calcified mitral apparatus, there are unique considerations to the surgical conduct of these procedures. Specifically, this article describes techniques that may be employed when the severity of MAC precludes typical repair or replacement strategies.RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2021, 77 patients were operated on by a single surgeon for mitral valve disease complicated by severe MAC. Using the systematic approach described herein, 1-year mortality was 7.8% and overall mortality over a follow-up period extending 1 to 8 years was 9.1%.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent challenges of mitral valve repair or replacement in the setting of severe MAC, a systematic approach beginning with preoperative planning, modification of annular suture placement, and techniques to mitigate severe complications have, in our experience, resulting in a reliable methodology for managing severe MAC with excellent outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/02184923221136935\n\nView details for PubMedID 36537728\n\nAbstract\n\nExtrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an emerging technology that allows for rapid bio-fabrication of scaffolds with live cells. Alginate is a soft biomaterial that has been studied extensively as a bio-ink to support cell growth in 3D constructs. However, native alginate is a bio-inert material that requires modifications to allow for cell adhesion and cell growth. Cells grown in modified alginates with the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) motif, a naturally existing tripeptide sequence that is crucial to cell adhesion and proliferation, demonstrate enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and differentiation. Recently, the bioprinting technique using freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) has revolutionized 3D bioprinting, enabling the use of soft bio-inks that would otherwise collapse in air. However, the printability of RGD-modified alginates using the FRESH technique has not been evaluated. The associated physical properties and bioactivity of 3D bio-printed alginates after RGD modification remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the physical properties, printability, and cellular proliferation of native and RGD-modified alginate after extrusion-based 3D bioprinting in FRESH. We demonstrated tunable physical properties of native and RGD-modified alginates after FRESH 3D bioprinting. Sodium alginate with RGD modification, especially at a high concentration, was associated with greatly improved cell viability and integrin clustering, which further enhanced cell proliferation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/bioengineering9120807\n\nView details for PubMedID 36551013\n\nAbstract\n\nThe SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System is a novel technology that provides stable, optimal hypothermic control during organ transport. The objectives of this study were to describe our experience using the SherpaPak system and to compare outcomes after heart transplantation after using SherpaPak versus the conventional static cold storage method (non-SherpaPak).From 2018 to June 2021, 62 SherpaPak and 186 non-SherpaPak patients underwent primary heart transplantation at Stanford University with follow-up through May 2022. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, and secondary end points were postoperative complications. Optimal variable ratio matching, cox proportional hazards regression model, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed.Before matching, the SherpaPak versus non-SherpaPak patients were older and received organs with significantly longer total allograft ischemic time. After matching, SherpaPak patients required fewer units of blood product for perioperative transfusion compared with non-SherpaPak patients but otherwise had similar postoperative outcomes such as hospital length of stay, primary graft dysfunction, inotrope score, mechanical circulatory support use, cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, new renal failure requiring dialysis, postoperative bleeding or tamponade requiring reoperation, infection, and survival.In conclusion, this is one of the first retrospective comparison studies that evaluated the outcomes of heart transplantation using organs preserved and transported via the SherpaPak system. Given the excellent outcomes, despite prolonged total allograft ischemic time, it may be reasonable to adopt the SherpaPak system to accept organs from a remote location to further expand the donor pool.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/TP.0000000000004416\n\nView details for PubMedID 36510359\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is one of the most common cardiac valvular diseases, and it is frequently caused by cusp prolapse. However, the precise relationship of commissure position and aortic cusp prolapse with AR is not fully understood. In this study, we developed a 3D-printed commissure geometric alignment device to investigate the effect of commissure height and inter-commissure angle on AR and aortic cusp prolapse.METHODS: Three porcine aortic valves were explanted from hearts obtained from a meat abattoir and were mounted in the commissure geometric alignment device. Nine commissure configurations were tested for each specimen, exploring independent and concurrent effects of commissure height and inter-commissure angle change on AR and aortic cusp prolapse. Each commissure configuration was tested in our 3D printed ex vivo left heart simulator. Hemodynamics data, echocardiography, and high-speed videography were obtained.RESULTS: AR due to aortic cusp prolapse was successfully generated using our commissure geometric alignment device. Mean aortic regurgitation fraction measured for the baseline, high commissure, low commissure, high commissure and wide inter-commissure angle, high commissure and narrow inter-commissure angle, low commissure and wide inter-commissure angle, low commissure and narrow inter-commissure angle, wide commissure, and narrow commissure configurations from all samples were 4.6±1.4%, 9.7±3.7%, 4.2±0.5%, 11.7±5.8%, 13.0±8.5%, 4.8±0.9%, 7.3±1.7%, 5.1±1.2%, and 7.1±3.1%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: AR was most prominent when commissure heights were changed from their native levels with concomitant reduced inter-commissure angle. Findings from this study provide important evidence demonstrating the relationship between commissure position and aortic cusp prolapse and may have a significant impact on patient outcomes after surgical repair of aortic valves.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13019-022-02049-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 36496476\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent studies have linked mitral valve prolapse to localized myocardial fibrosis, ventricular arrhythmia, and even sudden cardiac death independent of mitral regurgitation or hemodynamic dysfunction. The primary mechanistic theory is rooted in increased papillary muscle traction and forces due to prolapse, yet no biomechanical evidence exists showing increased forces. Our objective was to evaluate the biomechanical relationship between prolapse and papillary muscle forces, leveraging advances in ex vivo modeling and technologies. We hypothesized that mitral valve prolapse with limited hemodynamic dysfunction leads to significantly higher papillary muscle forces, which could be a possible trigger for cellular and electrophysiological changes in the papillary muscles and adjacent myocardium.We developed an ex vivo papillary muscle force transduction and novel neochord length adjustment system capable of modeling targeted prolapse. Using 3 unique ovine models of mitral valve prolapse (bileaflet or posterior leaflet prolapse), we directly measured hemodynamics and forces, comparing physiologic and prolapsing valves.We found that bileaflet prolapse significantly increases papillary muscle forces by 5% to 15% compared with an optimally coapting valve, which are correlated with statistically significant decreases in coaptation length. Moreover, we observed significant changes in the force profiles for prolapsing valves when compared with normal controls.We discovered that bileaflet prolapse with the absence of hemodynamic dysfunction results in significantly elevated forces and altered dynamics on the papillary muscles. Our work suggests that the sole reduction of mitral regurgitation without addressing reduced coaptation lengths and thus increased leaflet surface area exposed to ventricular pressure gradients (ie, billowing leaflets) is insufficient for an optimal repair.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.122.011928\n\nView details for PubMedID 36538583\n\nAbstract\n\nWe sought to understand how leaflet forces change in response to annular dilation and leaflet tethering in single ventricle physiology. Explanted fetal bovine tricuspid valves were sutured onto image-derived annuli and ventricular mounts. Control valves (CV) were secured to a size-matched HLHS-type annulus and compared to: 1) normal tricuspid valves (NTV) secured to a size-matched saddle-shaped annulus, 2) HLHS-type annulus with leaflet tethering (LT), 3) HLHS-type annulus with annular dilation (DIL), or 5) a combined disease model with both dilation and tethering (DIS). The specimens were tested in a systemic heart simulator at various SVPs. Leaflet forces were measured using optical strain sensors sutured to each leaflet edge. Average force in the anterior leaflet was 43.2% lower in CV compared to NTV (p<0.001). LT resulted in a 6.6% increase in average forces on the anterior leaflet (p=0.04), 10.7% increase on the posterior leaflet (p=0.03), and 14.1% increase on the septal leaflet (p<0.001). In DIL, average septal leaflet forces increased relative to the control valves by 42.2% (p=0.01). In DIS, average leaflet forces increased by 54.8% in the anterior leaflet (p<0.001), 37.6% in the posterior leaflet (p=0.03), and 79.9% in the septal leaflet (p<0.001). The anterior leaflet experiences the highest forces in the normal tricuspid annulus under SVP conditions. Annular dilation resulted in an increase in forces on the septal leaflet and leaflet tethering resulted in an increase in forces across all 3 leaflets. Annular dilation and leaflet tethering combined resulted in the largest increase in leaflet forces across all 3 leaflets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1053/j.semtcvs.2022.09.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 36455710\n\nAbstract\n\nApproximately 95% of patients of any age undergoing contemporary, coronary bypass surgery will receive at least 1 saphenous vein graft (SVG). It is recognized that SVG will develop progressive and accelerated atherosclerosis, resulting in a stenosis, and in occlusion that occurs in 50% by 10 years postoperatively. For arterial conduits, there is little evidence of progressive failure as for SVG. Could avoidance of SVG (total arterial revascularization [TAR]) lead to a different late (>5 year) survival? A literature review of 23 studies (N = 100,314 matched patients) at a mean 8.8 years postoperative found reduced all-cause mortality for TAR (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.71-0.84; P < 0.001). An expanded analysis with a new unpublished data set (N = 63,288 matched patients) was combined with the literature review (N = 127,565). It found reduced all-cause mortality for TAR (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.85; P < 0.001). Additional Bayesian analysis found a very high probability of a TAR-associated reduction all-cause mortality.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacc.2022.08.795\n\nView details for PubMedID 36328694\n\nAbstract\n\nFatigue testing of mechanical components is important for designing safe implantable medical prosthetics, and accelerated systems can be used to increase the speed of evaluation. We developed a platform for accelerated testing of linear force applications of cardiac devices, called the Fatigue Acceleration System Tester (FAST). FAST operates using a core translation mechanism, converting motor-driven rotary motion to linear actuation. The advantages of using this mechanism include 40x rate increases with largely 3D-printed components, versatility based on modular design paradigms, and accessible manufacturability with 3D-printable forms, enabling access for small and large research laboratories alike. FAST has been crucial in informing our designs for continuing device development. Over two fatigue cycle courses of 52 and 110 days, the motor cycled at rotational frequencies up to 1500 rpm, 43 times faster than those experienced in a typical heart and equating to approximate life cycles of five and ten years, respectively. In designing FAST, our goal was to accessibly bring a strong mechanical basis to study the long-term effects of repeated loading, and we present a design that can be applied across many industries to not only evaluate fatigue performance, but also generate any cycling linear motion.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.medengphy.2022.103896\n\nView details for PubMedID 36371080\n\nAbstract\n\nSystolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV) is a complex pathological phenomenon often occurring as an iatrogenic effect of surgical and transcatheter intervention. While the aortomitral angle has long been linked to SAM, the mechanistic relationship is not well understood. We developed the first ex vivo heart simulator capable of recreating native aortomitral biomechanics, and to generate models of SAM, we performed anterior leaflet augmentation and sequential undersized annuloplasty procedures on porcine aortomitral junctions (n=6). Hemodynamics and echocardiograms were recorded, and echocardiographic analysis revealed significantly reduced coaptation-septal distances confirming SAM (p=0.003) and effective manipulation of the aortomitral angle (p<0.001). Upon increasing the angle in our pathological models, we recorded significant increases (p<0.05) in both coaptation-septal distance and multiple hemodynamic metrics, such as aortic peak flow and effective orifice area. These results indicate that an increased aortomitral angle is correlated with more efficient hemodynamic performance of the valvular system, presenting a potential, clinically translatable treatment opportunity for reducing the risk and adverse effects of SAM. As the standard of care shifts towards surgical and transcatheter interventions, it is increasingly important to better understand SAM biomechanics, and our advances represent a significant step towards that goal.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10439-022-03091-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 36264407\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: The risk, cost, and adverse outcomes associated with packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in patients with cardiopulmonary failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have raised concerns regarding the overutilization of RBC products. It is, therefore, necessary to establish optimal transfusion criteria and protocols for patients supported with ECMO. The goal of this study was to establish specific criteria for RBC transfusions in patients undergoing ECMO.METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at Stanford University Hospital. Data on RBC utilization during the entire hospital stay were obtained, which included patients aged ≥18years who received ECMO support between 1 January 2017, and 30 June 2020 (n = 281). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.RESULTS: Hemoglobin (HGB) levels >10g/dL before transfusion did not improve in-hospital survival. Therefore, we revised the HGB threshold to ≤10g/dL to guide transfusion in patients undergoing ECMO. To validate this intervention, we prospectively compared the pre- and post-intervention cohorts for in-hospital mortality. Post-intervention analyses found 100% compliance for all eligible records and a decrease in the requirement for RBC transfusion by 1.2 units per patient without affecting the mortality.CONCLUSIONS: As an institution-driven value-based approach to guide transfusion in patients undergoing ECMO, we lowered the threshold HGB level. Validation of this revised intervention demonstrated excellent compliance and reduced the need for RBC transfusion while maintaining the clinical outcome. Our findings can help reform value-based healthcare in this cohort while maintaining the outcome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/02676591221128138\n\nView details for PubMedID 36148806\n\nAbstract\n\nAnnuloplasty ring choice and design are critical to the long-term efficacy of mitral valve (MV) repair. DynaRing is a selectively compliant annuloplasty ring composed of varying stiffness elastomer segments, a shape-set nitinol core, and a cross diameter filament. The ring provides sufficient stiffness to stabilize a diseased annulus while allowing physiological annular dynamics. Moreover, adjusting elastomer properties provides a mechanism for effectively tuning key MV metrics to specific patients. We evaluate the ring embedded in porcine valves with an ex-vivo left heart simulator and perform a 150 million cycle fatigue test via a custom oscillatory system. We present a patient-specific design approach for determining ring parameters using a finite element model optimization and patient MRI data. Ex-vivo experiment results demonstrate that motion of DynaRing closely matches literature values for healthy annuli. Findings from the patient-specific optimization establish DynaRing's ability to adjust the anterior-posterior and intercommissural diameters and saddle height by up to 8.8%, 5.6%, 19.8%, respectively, and match a wide range of patient data.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1115/1.4054445\n\nView details for PubMedID 35646225\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of mitral valve (MV) dysfunction, particularly in disadvantaged areas and developing countries. There lacks a critical understanding of the disease biomechanics, and as such, the purpose of this study was to generate the first ex vivo porcine model of rheumatic MV disease by simulating the human pathophysiology and hemodynamics.METHODS: Healthy porcine valves were altered with heat treatment, commissural suturing, and cyanoacrylate tissue coating, all of which approximate the pathology of leaflet stiffening and thickening as well as commissural fusion. Hemodynamic data, echocardiography, and high-speed videography were collected in a paired manner for control and model valves (n=4) in an ex vivo left heart simulator. Valve leaflets were characterized in an Instron tensile testing machine to understand the mechanical changes of the model (n=18).RESULTS: The model showed significant differences indicative of rheumatic disease: increased regurgitant fractions (p<0.001), reduced effective orifice areas (p<0.001), augmented transmitral mean gradients (p<0.001), and increased leaflet stiffness (p=0.025).CONCLUSION: This work represents the creation of the first ex vivo model of rheumatic MV disease, bearing close similarity to the human pathophysiology and hemodynamics, and it will be used to extensively study both established and new treatment techniques, benefitting the millions of affected victims.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s13239-022-00641-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 35941509\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Suture pull-out remains a significant mechanism of long-term neochordal repair failure, as demonstrated by clinical reports on recurrent mitral valve regurgitation and need for reoperation. The objective of this study was to provide a quantitative comparison of suture pull-out forces for various neochordal implantation locations.Methods: Posterior leaflets were excised from fresh porcine mitral valves (n=54) and fixed between two 3-dimensional-printed plates. Gore-Tex CV-5 sutures (WL Gore & Associates Inc) were placed with distances from the leading edge and widths between anchoring sutures with values of 2mm, 6mm, and 10mm for a total of 9 groups (n=6 per group). Mechanical testing was performed using a tensile testing machine to evaluate pull-out force of the suture through the mitral valve leaflet.Results: Increasing the suture anchoring width improved failure strength significantly across all leading-edge distances (P<.001). Additionally, increasing the leading-edge distance from 2mm to 6mm increased suture pull-out forces significantly across all suture widths (P<.001). For 6-mm and 10-mm widths, increasing the leading-edge distance from 6mm to 10mm increased suture pull-out forces by an average of 3.58±0.15N; in comparison, for leading-edge distances of 6mm and 10mm, increasing the suture anchoring width from 6mm to 10mm improves the force by an average of 7.09±0.44N.Conclusions: Increasing suture anchoring width and leading-edge distance improves the suture pull-out force through the mitral leaflet, which may optimize postrepair durability. The results suggest a comparative advantage to increasing suture anchoring width compared with leading-edge distance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjtc.2022.05.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 35967240\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Heart-lung transplantation (HLTx) is a definitive surgical procedure for end-stage cardiopulmonary failure. Studies to understand the relationship between ethnicity and race and outcomes after HLTx are needed to uphold equitable HLTx access to the increasingly diverse U.S. population facing advanced cardiopulmonary failure.Objectives: This study sought to examine the outcomes of HLTx recipients of Asian origin, with emphasis on the ethnic and racial disparities in the outcomes.Methods: We analyzed data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) for patients of≥18 years of age who underwent HLTx between 1987 and 2021. Propensity-score matching was performed between Asian and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), with a 1:3 matching ratio based on the propensity score of each patient estimated by multivariable logistic regression.Results: We identified 42 Asian and Asian American heart-lung transplant recipients and 834 NHW recipients. In the pre-matched cohort, the median survival was 1,459days (IQR: 1,080-2,692days) in Asian recipients after transplantation, whereas it was 1,521days (IQR: 1,262-1,841days) in White recipients. Of the 876 recipients, 156 transplants were successfully matched (Asian, n=36; NHW, n=108). Among the post-transplantation outcomes, there were no significant differences in morbidity and mortality between Asian and NHW cohorts.Conclusions: This large-scale analysis in Asian patients will have important implications in Asian countries that have relatively fewer HLTx surgeries. An outcome equivalent to NHW in Asian patients, as demonstrated in our study, could be the driving force for further expansion of HLTx surgeries in Asian countries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jacasi.2022.03.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 36339364\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives The Ross procedure using the inclusion technique with anti-commissural plication (ACP) is associated with excellent valve hemodynamics and leaflet kinematics. The objective was to evaluate pulmonary cusp's biomechanics and fluttering by including coronary flow in the Ross procedure. Methods Ten porcine and five human pulmonary autografts were harvested from a meat abattoir and from heart transplant patients. Five porcine autografts without reinforcement served as controls. The other autografts were prepared using the inclusion technique with and without ACP (NACP). Hemodynamic and high-speed videography data were measured using the ex vivo heart simulator. Results Although porcine autografts showed similar leaflet rapid opening and closing mean velocities, human ACP compared to NACP autografts demonstrated lower leaflet rapid opening mean velocity in the right (p=.02) and left coronary cusps (p=.003). The porcine and human autograft leaflet rapid opening and closing mean velocities were similar in all cusps. Porcine autografts showed similar leaflet flutter frequencies in the left (p=.3) and non-coronary cusps (p=.4), but porcine NACP autografts vs. controls demonstrated higher leaflet flutter frequency in the right coronary cusp (p=.05). The human NACP vs. ACP autografts showed higher flutter frequency in the non-coronary cusp (p=.02). The leaflet flutter amplitudes were similar in all three cusps in both porcine and human autografts. Conclusions The ACP compared to NACP autografts in the Ross procedure was associated with more favorable leaflet kinematics. These results may translate to improved long-term durability of the pulmonary autografts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1115/1.4055033\n\nView details for PubMedID 35864775\n\nAbstract\n\nPeripheral artery disease and the associated ischemic wounds are substantial causes of global morbidity and mortality, affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Although advancements have been made in preventive, pharmacologic, and surgical strategies to treat this disease, ischemic wounds, a consequence of end-stage peripheral artery disease, remain a significant clinical and economic challenge. Synechococcus elongatus is a cyanobacterium that grows photoautotrophically and converts carbon dioxide and water into oxygen. We present a novel topical biologic gel containing S. elongatus that provides oxygen via photosynthesis to augment wound healing by rescuing ischemic tissues caused by peripheral artery disease. By using light rather than blood as a source of energy, our novel topical therapy significantly accelerated wound healing in two rodent ischemic wound models. This novel topical gel can be directly translated to clinical practice by using a localized, portable light source without interfering with patients' daily activities, demonstrating potential to generate a paradigm shift in treating ischemic wounds from peripheral artery disease. Its novelty, low production cost, and ease of clinical translatability can potentially impact the clinical care for millions of patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-14085-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 35705660\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground. The revolutions in AI hold tremendous capacity to augment human achievements in surgery, but robust integration of deep learning algorithms with high-fidelity surgical simulation remains a challenge. We present a novel application of reinforcement learning (RL) for automating surgical maneuvers in a graphical simulation.Methods. In the Unity3D game engine, the Machine Learning-Agents package was integrated with the NVIDIA FleX particle simulator for developing autonomously behaving RL-trained scissors. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was used to reward movements and desired behavior such as movement along desired trajectory and optimized cutting maneuvers along the deformable tissue-like object. Constant and proportional reward functions were tested, and TensorFlow analytics was used to informed hyperparameter tuning and evaluate performance.Results. RL-trained scissors reliably manipulated the rendered tissue that was simulated with soft-tissue properties. A desirable trajectory of the autonomously behaving scissors was achieved along 1 axis. Proportional rewards performed better compared to constant rewards. Cumulative reward and PPO metrics did not consistently improve across RL-trained scissors in the setting for movement across 2 axes (horizontal and depth).Conclusion. Game engines hold promising potential for the design and implementation of RL-based solutions to simulated surgical subtasks. Task completion was sufficiently achieved in one-dimensional movement in simulations with and without tissue-rendering. Further work is needed to optimize network architecture and parameter tuning for increasing complexity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/15533506221095298\n\nView details for PubMedID 35503302\n\nAbstract\n\nOnce considered primarily a disorder of lipid deposition, coronary artery disease is an incurable, life-threatening disease that is now also characterized by chronic inflammation notable for the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques containing immune cells in various states of activation and differentiation. Understanding how these immune cells contribute to disease progression may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.We used single-cell technology and in vitro assays to interrogate the immune microenvironment of human coronary atherosclerotic plaque at different stages of maturity.In addition to macrophages, we found a high proportion of αβ T cells in the coronary plaques. Most of these T cells lack high expression of CCR7 and L-selectin, indicating that they are primarily antigen-experienced, memory cells. Notably, nearly one-third of these cells express the HLA-DRA surface marker, signifying activation through their TCRs (T-cell receptors).

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of fractional flow reserve (FFR) guidance and current generation, zotarolimus drug-eluting stents (DES) on quality of life after PCI compared with CABG. Methods: The Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) 3 trial is a multicenter, international trial including 1500 patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who were randomly assigned to either CABG or FFR-guided PCI. Quality of life was measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire at baseline, 1 and 12 months. The Canadian Cardiovascular Class (CCS) angina grade and working status were assessed at the same time points and at 6 months. The primary objective was to compare EQ-5D summary index at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included angina grade and work status. Results: The EQ-5D summary index at 12 months did not differ between the PCI and CABG groups (difference=0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.016 to 0.017, p=0.946). The trajectory of EQ-5D over the 12 months differed (p<0.001) between PCI and CABG: at 1 month, EQ-5D was 0.063 (95% CI 0.047 to 0.079) higher in the PCI group. A similar trajectory was found for the EQ visual analogue scale. The proportion of patients with CCS 2 or greater angina at 12 months was 6.2% vs 3.1% (OR=2.5, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.8), respectively in the PCI group compared with the CABG group. A greater percentage of younger patients (<65 years-old) were working at 12 months in the PCI group compared with the CABG group (68% vs 57%, OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 8.8). Conclusions: In the FAME 3 trial, quality of life after FFR-guided PCI with current generation DES compared with CABG was similar at one year. The rate of significant angina was low in both groups and not significantly different. The trajectory of improvement in quality of life was significantly better after PCI, as was working status in those less than 65 years old.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.060049\n\nView details for PubMedID 35369704\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Neochordal implantation is a common form of surgical mitral valve (MV) repair. However, neochord length is assessed using static left ventricular pressurization, leading surgeons to evaluate leaflet coaptation and valve competency when the left ventricle is dilating instead of contracting physiologically, referred to as diastolic phase inversion (DPI). We hypothesize that the difference in papillary muscle (PM) positioning between DPI and physiologic systole results in miscalculated neochord lengths, which might affect repair performance.Methods: Porcine MVs (n=6) were mounted in an exvivo heart simulator and PMs were affixed to robots that accurately simulate PM motion. Baseline hemodynamic and chordal strain data were collected, after which P2 chordae were severed to simulate posterior leaflet prolapse from chordal rupture and subsequent mitral regurgitation. Neochord implantation was performed in the physiologic and DPI static configurations.Results: Although both repairs successfully reduced mitral regurgitation, the DPI repair resulted in longer neochordae (2.19±0.4mm; P<.01). Furthermore, the hemodynamic performance was reduced for the DPI repair resulting in higher leakage volume (P=.01) and regurgitant fraction (P<.01). Peak chordal forces were reduced in the physiologic repair (0.57±0.11N) versus the DPI repair (0.68±0.12N; P<.01).Conclusions: By leveraging advanced exvivo technologies, we were able to quantify the effects of static pressurization on neochordal length determination. Our findings suggest that this post-repair assessment might slightly overestimate the neochordal length and that additional marginal shortening of neochordae might positively affect MV repair performance and durability by reducing load on surrounding native chordae.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjtc.2022.01.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 35403058\n\nAbstract\n\nObjectives: Cardiothoracic (CT) surgeons with National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 funding face a highly competitive renewal process. The factors that contribute to successful grant renewal for CT surgeons remain poorly defined. We hypothesized that renewed basic science grants are associated with high research output and scholarly impact during the preceding award cycle.Methods: Using a database of academic CT surgeons (n=992) at accredited training institutions in 2018, we identified basic science R01 grants awarded to CT surgeon principal investigators since 1985. Data for each award were obtained from publicly available online sources. Scholarly impact was evaluated using the NIH-validated relative citation ratio (RCR), defined as an article's citation rate divided by that of R01-funded publications in the same field. Continuous data are presented as medians and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test.Results: We identified 102 basic science R01 award cycles, including 33 that were renewed (32.4%). Renewed and nonrenewed awards had a similar start year and funding period. Principal investigators of renewed versus nonrenewed awards were similar in surgical subspecialty, research training, attending experience, academic rank, and previous NIH funding. Renewed awards produced more publications per year over the funding cycle (3.4 vs 1.5; P=.0010) and exhibited a greater median RCR during the funding cycle (0.84 vs 0.66; P=.0183).Conclusions: CT surgery basic science R01 grants are associated with high research output and scholarly impact. At the 50th percentile among renewed grants, CT surgeons published 3.4 funded manuscripts per year with a median RCR of 0.84 during the previous award cycle.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.xjon.2021.10.063\n\nView details for PubMedID 36003453\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Mitral annuloplasty rings restore annular dimensions to increase leaflet coaptation, serving a fundamental component in mitral valve repair. However, biomechanical evaluations of annuloplasty rings are lacking. We aim to biomechanically analyze flexible and rigid annuloplasty rings using an ex vivo mitral annular dilation model.METHODS: Juvenile porcine mitral valves (n=4) with intercommissural distance of 28mm were dilated to intercommissural distances of 40mm using a 3D-printed dilator and were sewn to an elastic mount. Fiber bragg grating sensors were anchored to native chordae to measure chordal forces. The valves were repaired using size 28 rigid and flexible annuloplasty rings in a random order. Hemodynamic data, echocardiography, and chordal force measurements were collected.RESULTS: Mitral annular dilation resulted in decreased leaflet coaptation height and increased mitral regurgitation fraction. Both the flexible and rigid annuloplasty rings effectively increased leaflet coaptation height compared to that post dilation. Rigid ring annuloplasty repair significantly decreased the mitral regurgitation fraction. Flexible annuloplasty ring repair reduced the chordal rate of change of force (7.1±4.4N/s versus 8.6±5.9N/s, p=0.02) and peak force (0.6±0.5N versus 0.7±0.6N, p=0.01) compared to that from post dilation. Rigid annuloplasty ring repair was associated with higher chordal rate of change of force (9.8±5.8N/s, p=0.0001) and peak force (0.7±0.5N, p=0.01) compared to that after flexible ring annuloplasty repair.CONCLUSIONS: Both rigid and flexible annuloplasty rings are effective in increasing mitral leaflet coaptation height. Although the rigid annuloplasty ring was associated with slightly higher chordal stress compared to that of the flexible annuloplasty ring, it was more effective in mitral regurgitation reduction. This study may help direct the design of an optimal annuloplasty ring to further improve patient outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12872-022-02515-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 35219298\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: One major challenge in generating reproducible aortic valve (AV) repair results is the inability to assess AV morphology under physiologic pressure. A transparent intraoperative aortic valve visualization device was designed and manufactured.DESCRIPTION: This device is comprised of an open proximal end, a cantilevered edge to allow attachment of the device to the aorta or graft, a distal viewing surface, and two side ports for fluid delivery and air removal.EVALUATION: The performance of the device was evaluated ex vivo using normal porcine AV in situ (n=3), AV after valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR, n=3), and porcine pulmonary valve in Ross procedure (n=3), and in 3 patients who underwent VSARR. AV morphology was clearly visualized using the device in all experiments. In human, the use of this device successfully illustrated cusp prolapse after the initial VSARR and effectively guided additional cusp repair.CONCLUSIONS: This device successfully allows for direct visual assessment of the AV apparatus under physiologic pressure. The use of this device can potentially increase the adoptability of AV repair in clinical practice.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2022.02.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 35216987\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: The severity of acute papillary muscle (PM) rupture varies according to the extent and site of the rupture. However, the haemodynamic effects of different rupture variations are still poorly understood. Using a novel ex vivo model, we sought to study acute PM rupture to improve clinical management.METHODS: Using porcine mitral valves (n=32) mounted within an ex vivo left heart simulator, PM rupture was simulated. The mitral valve was divided into quadrants for analysis according to the PM heads. Acute PM rupture was simulated by incrementally cutting from 1/3 to the total number of chordae"
