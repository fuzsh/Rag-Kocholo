I need to do the opposite.\n\nI'm working with a software that monitors compiler invocation in order to do static code analysis. But if compiler process is closed too quickly, monitoring software can miss it. So I need to slow compilation down. I understand that's a terrible solution and hope it will be temporary.\n\nI came up with two solutions:\n\nDisable parallel build, enable preprocessor and compiler listing generation. It works but requires a lot of mouse clicking\n\nUse compiler option to force inclusion of special header file that somehow slows compilation.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't come up with something simple to write and hard to compile at the same time. Using a lot of #warning seems to work but obviously clutters the output significantly.\n\nI'm using Keil with armcc compiler, so I can use most of C++11 but maximum template recursion depth is just 63.\n\nPreferably this should not produce any overhead for binary size or running time.\n\nUPD: I'll try to clarify this a bit. I know that's a horrible idea, I know that this problem should be solved differently. I will try to solve it differently but I also want to explore this possibility."
