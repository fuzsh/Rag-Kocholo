We need to explain why additional works have to take place...\n\nWe would need much more context to answer this question.\n\nPlease say in other words what you are trying to say. What is the topic? Please give the complete sentence, as well as a sentence or two before and after (up to four sentences).\n\n\"Basis for additional works\" would be the title of a table column and \"compelled optimization\" would be a cell of the table, one of the reasons for additional works (is it better to write \"reasons\" instead of \"basis\"?). The topic is pipeline construction. I don't understand what other context is necessary.\n\nI don't understand what other context is necessary.\n\nIs TT correct in his understanding that the term \"compelled optimization\" means \"cheaper\"?\n\nWe can't answer your question about whether it should be \"compelled\", \"forced\" or anything else, unless we know what it's supposed to mean.\n\n\"Compelled\" or \"forced\" is supposed to mean we have to optimize the route, not to optimize because we want to do it ourselves, and this is a reason for performing additional works.\n\n\"Compelled\" or \"forced\" is supposed to mean we have to optimize the route, not to optimize because we want to do it ourselves, and this is a reason for performing additional works.\n\nThis raises questions about the meaning of optimize. If the altered route isn't cheaper, if what sense is it better? Less ecologically damaging? Closer to government guidelines?"
