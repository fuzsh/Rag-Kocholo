Follow him for more visuals on leadership, productivity & full potential. How do you create an inclusive environment that values the contributions of quiet team members? Original post below: ------ The most powerful tool - silence: We can learn a lot from quiet people: â‡‰ Their calming influence â‡‰ Their ability to immerse in tasks â‡‰ Their fresh and innovative perspectives â‡‰ Their focus on collective success â‡‰ Their rich imaginations However, despite this - 70% of introverts believe they are overlooked at work. (Myers-Briggs) Companies might miss great ideas and insights because quiet people aren't heard. So, that leads to a question: How can we better integrate quiet people into our workplaces? Here are some ideas: â‡‰ Give them time to prepare â‡‰ Use project management tools â‡‰ Use written suggestions and feedback â‡‰ Respect communication styles â‡‰ Have one-on-one check-ins Great leaders create spaces where every voice matters. Letâ€™s value the power of silence. ----- Grow your professional skills with daily visual wisdom.
