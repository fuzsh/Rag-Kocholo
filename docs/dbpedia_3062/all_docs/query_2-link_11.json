        "text": "What Is Duress?\n\nThe term duress refers to the act of using force and/or other forms of pressure to compel someone to act against their wishes or interests. Duress is commonly used to defend individuals who are compelled or coerced to commit a crime because of the potential for serious imminent harm.\n\nFinancial duress can be caused by negative situations, such as the loss of a job or skyrocketing bills. Economic pressure can cause financial duress, leading people to commit involuntarily risky financial practices.\n\nHow Duress Works\n\nDuress occurs when individuals feel compelled to act in a way that goes against their principles. As such, a person is under duress when they are prevented from acting (or not acting) according to their own free will. Individuals can experience duress through force, threats, false imprisonment, coercion, and/or psychological pressure. These are common reasons when defending individuals accused of committing or participating in criminal acts or acting against their conscience.\n\nDuress also plays a part in the economic situation of individuals. Personal financial duress can be brought on in several ways, including through the loss of employment. Individuals can also experience financial duress when they lose their homes to foreclosure after defaulting on their mortgage or when their savings accounts are wiped out because of a health crisis and high medical bills. In theory, these events could lead to a person acting unlawfully due to the added stress.\n\nFinancial duress can occur internally as well. This happens when a business borrows more than is prudent or engages in questionable merger activity. These self-inflicted wounds can permanently damage a business. At other times, duress can come about because of external forces, such as the impact on a business from a widescale economic recession.\n\nTypes of Duress\n\nDuress can be classified under three different categories, which are highlighted below.\n\nPhysical Duress: This type of duress occurs when an individual feels threatened with acts of physical violence to commit acts that go against their conscience or they may be coerced with physical harm either to themselves or someone else to commit criminal acts. For instance, a person may be told a family member will be killed if they don't sign a document transferring their assets.\n\nPsychological Duress: People may feel pressured to do things they don't want to under psychological duress. Examples of psychological duress include the threat of withholding necessities or demeaning individuals so they act in a certain way.\n\nEconomic or Financial Duress: Individuals may act a certain way when the economy or their financial situation changes. For instance, the loss of employment may lead a homeowner to stop paying their rent/mortgage and/or their bills. A business manager may revise and sign a new contract under duress to appease the other party.\n\nExample of Duress\n\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how duress works. Let's say an individual makes unlawful threats or engages in coercive behavior that causes a relative to forcibly sign an agreement or execute their last will and testament. This means the person is causing their relative to be under duress.\n\nFinancial duress describes an environment where business managers make difficult decisions under stress. These suboptimal choices are often made outside of standard operating and financial conditions.\n\nTo keep a business afloat, a manager may sell an asset knowing it will disrupt business in another way. Financial duress puts the business between a rock and a hard place where no good solution exists. This situation can lead to someone acting under duress to protect their money and financial interests.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDuress occurs whenever there's an imminent threat of physical, psychological, and/or financial harm to an individual from an outside source. For instance, you may feel compelled to do something that goes against your will (like transferring your assets) or the law (like committing a crime) or face being killed. To prove duress, you must show that you had a contract (or relationship) with the other party and that they made some threat that led you to do something you didn't want to do in the first place."
