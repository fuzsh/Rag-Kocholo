[CCP 2030.290(b) (Interrogatories); CCP 2031.300(b) (Requests for Production); CCP 2033.280(b) (Requests for Admission).\n\nAdd Time if Responding Party Served Insufficient Responses via Mail – Add 5 (mailed in CA), 10 (Mailed in US outside of CA), or 20 (mailed outside of US) days to the 45 day time limit if the responding party served their insufficient responses via mail. Source: [CCP 1013(a)].\n\nFinal Deadline is 15 Days Before Initial Trial Date – Final day to hear discovery motions, including motions to compel, is 15 days before the initial discovery deadline.

[CCP 2024.020(a)]\n\nMeet and Confer\n\nMust Meet and Confer Prior to Filing a Motion To Compel – The moving party must include a declaration stating facts that show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. [CCP 2016.040].\n\nSanctions for Failing to Meet and Confer – The court “shall” sanction the moving party if he files a Motion to Compel before attempting a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to meet and confer with the responding party. Note, there is no meet and confer duty when no response is served.

If you do not have online access, you may obtain the tentative ruling over the telephone by calling (916) 874-8142 and a deputy clerk will read the ruling to you. If you wish to request oral argument, you must contact the clerk at (916) 874-7858 (Department 53) or (916) 874-7848 (Department 54) and the opposing party before 4:00 p.m. the court day before the hearing. If you do not call the court and the opposing party by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing, no hearing will be held.”” [Sacramento Local Rule 3.04].\n\nFormat of Moving Papers\n\nFifteen (15) Page Limit on Moving Papers – [CRC 3.1113(f)]\n\nOver Ten (10) Pages Requires a Table of Authorities – [CRC 3.1113(f)]\n\nSanctions Must Be in Notice of Motion – Requests for sanctions must be included in the notice of motion, including against whom sanctions are sought.

[CCP 1005(b); CRC 2.306].\n\nSpecific Motions to Compel\n\nInterrogatory Responses\n\nGrounds For Motion – A party may move to compel responses or additional responses if the responses to interrogatories are (1) incomplete, (2) evasive, or (3) an objection is made that is either too general or without merit. [CCP 2030.300(a)].\n\nRequirements for Motion – The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proper motion to compel interrogatories:\n\nIdentify the interrogatories in question by name and set number.

[CCP 2025.480(a)].\n\nRequirements for Motion – The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proper motion to compel interrogatories:\n\nMeet and Confer Declaration Required. [CCP 2025.480(b)].\n\nSeparate Statement Required. [CRC 3.1345(a)(4)-(5)].\n\nAdjourning Deposition – If a deponent does not answer a question asked at deposition, the deposition-taker may choose to either (1) adjourn the deposition to file a motion, or (2) complete the deposition on other matters. Unless the answer is necessary to move forward, the latter usually is more practical. [CCP 2025.460(d)].\n\nNotice of Motion May be Given Orally at Deposition – For party witnesses, the deposing attorney may give notice of the time and place of the motion to compel orally at deposition. For a non-party witness written notice is required. This section is usually not practical to invoke, and notice may always be given via the usual written method. [CCP 2025.480].\n\nDeadline 60 days: Motion to Compel must be filed within 60 days from the completion of the deposition transcript. [See Above].\n\nDocument Requests / Inspection Demands\n\nGrounds For Motion – A party may move to compel the production of documents or things if the response (1) agrees to comply, but compliance is incomplete, (2) the responding party’s indication of inability to comply is incomplete, inadequate, or evasive, or (3) an objection to a request is made that is too general or without merit. [CCP 2031.310(a)].\n\nGood Cause Required – The moving party must state “specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”. [CCP 2031.310(b)(1)].\n\nRequirements for Motion – The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proper motion to compel interrogatories:\n\nIdentify the interrogatories in question by name and set number.

[CRC 3.1345(a)(3)].\n\nAttach Deposition Transcript – Sacramento does not allow lodging of deposition transcripts with the court. Instead, attach the cover page of the deposition (stating the party names) and the relevant pages of the deposition transcript, with relevant portions highlighted, to a supporting declaration to the motion. [Sacramento Local Rule 3.03(f)]\n\nNote: No Meet and Confer or Separate Statement Required When No Responses Given. [CCP 2031.320(a); CRC 3.1345(b)].\n\nDeadline 45 days: Motion to Compel must be filed within 45 days from insufficient response [See Above].\n\nRequests for Admissions\n\nGrounds For Motion – A party may move to compel responses or additional responses to Requests for Admission if (1) a response was evasive or incomplete, or (2) an objection is made that is too general or without merit. [CCP 2033.290(a)].\n\nRequirements for Motion – The following requirements must be fulfilled for a proper motion to compel interrogatories:\n\nIdentify the interrogatories in question by name and set number. [CRC 3.1345(d)].\n\nMeet and Confer Declaration Required. [CCP 2033.290(b)].\n\nSeparate Statement Required. [CRC 3.1345(a)(1)].\n\nMotion to Have Matters Deemed Admitted – If no response is given within the applicable time limit, the moving party may move to have unanswered admissions deemed admitted. [CCP 2033.280(b)].\n\nLate Responses May Provide a Remedy – Late-served responses to Requests for Admission that are in substantial compliance with CCP 2033.220 may prevent the harsh penalty of having matters deemed admitted. However, sanctions are “mandatory” against the late responding party if the requesting party has to file a motion. [CCP 2033.280(c)].\n\nDeadline 45 days: Motion to Compel must be filed within 45 days from insufficient response [See Above].\n\nOther Moving Papers\n\nSeparate Statement\n\nPurpose – If a Separate Statement is required, it should be filed and served with the other moving papers, and it should contain all the information necessary to understand each discovery request at issue, the response, and argument as to why additional responses are required. Essentially, the court needs to be able to read the separate statement by itself and be able to make an informed ruling without having to reference any other documents. [CRC 3.1345(c)].\n\nRequirements – For each request at issue, the separate statement must contain “all the information necessary to understand each discovery request” including: [CRC 3.1345].\n\nText of the request, interrogatory, or question.\n\nThe response and/or objections to the request.\n\nFactual support and legal argument as to why an additional response should be compelled.\n\nAny other text, definitions, or other information necessary to understand the above (for instance, in depositions, you may have to provide a page or two of background questions s\\to frame the issues).\n\nPrevious questions relied on by the question at issue (for instance, if a question says, “if the response to interrogatory #1 was affirmative, please state…” you may have to include interrogatory #1 and its response for reference).\n\nA summary of relevant pleadings.\n\nNote: Identify the interrogatories in question by name and set number.\n\nMeet and Confer Declaration\n\nRequirements – The declaration must “state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” [CCP 2016.040].\n\nDeclaration Language – A California Declaration requires this language: “I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.” This should be followed by the date and the declarant’s signature. [CCP 2015.5].\n\nProposed Order\n\nNormal Order Procedure – Normally, the prevailing party will need to prepare a proposed order, and serve it on the losing party. The losing party then has five days to object to the form. After the five days are up, the prevailing party is to file the proposed order, along with any objections (or a statement that no objections were received), with the court. [CRC 3.1312].\n\nMay Be Submitted – The moving party on a motion to compel may submit a proposed order along with the rest of his moving papers. [CRC 3.1113].\n\nSeparate Document – Do NOT staple your Proposed Order to your other moving papers. Do NOT attach it as an exhibit. [CRC 3.1113(m)].\n\n(Deposition Transcript)\n\nIn Motions to Compel deposition testimony, do not forget to attach the relevant parts of the deposition transcript as an exhibit. [See Above].\n\nSanctions\n\nAuthority for Court’s Sanction Power – The court may award sanctions for (1) misuse/abuse of discovery process, or (2) unsuccessfully bringing or opposing a discovery motion, (3) failure to meet and confer, (4) other specific situations.\n\nSanctions for Misuse/Abuse of Discovery – The following are considered misuse of the discovery process: [CCP 2023.010].\n\n(a) Persisting, over objection and without substantial justification, in an attempt to obtain information or materials that are outside the scope of permissible discovery.\n\n(b) Using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified procedures.\n\n(c) Employing a discovery method in a manner or to an extent that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.\n\n(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.\n\n(e) Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery.\n\n(f) Making an evasive response to discovery.\n\n(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.\n\n(h) Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to limit discovery.\n\n(i) Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery, if the section governing a particular discovery motion requires the filing of a declaration stating facts showing that an attempt at informal resolution has been made.\n\nSanctions for Unsuccessfully Bringing or Opposing a Discovery Motion – The court has discretionary statutory authority to award sanctions for unsuccessful discovery motions:\n\nCompelling Response to Interrogatories. [CCP 2030.290(c)].\n\nCompelling Further Response Interrogatories: [CCP 2030.300(d)].\n\nCompelling Inspection or Production: [CCP 2031.300(c)].\n\nCompelling Further Response to Inspection Demand: [CCP 2031.310(d)(h); CCP 2031.320 (b)].\n\nCompelling Further Response Request for Admission: [CCP 2033.290(d)].\n\nCompelling Deponent to Answer or Produce Documents: [CCP 2025.480(f)].\n\nSanctions for Failing to Meet and Confer – The court “shall” sanction the moving party if he files a Motion to Compel before attempting a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to meet and confer with the responding party.

Any award of sanctions must be supported by legal authority and a declaration stating in a non-conclusory fashion how sanctions were calculated.
