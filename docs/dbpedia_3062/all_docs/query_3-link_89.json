        "text": "Navigate to ‘Exploration’ reports and select as metrics ‘Bounce Rate’ and ‘Sessions’ and Dimensions as ‘Landing Page’.\n\nFilter by sessions rather than 100 (or maybe 50 for your specific project) to remove pages with fewer visits.\n\nHere is a video guide on how to do it:\n\n4. Misleading Title Tag And/Or Meta Description\n\nAsk yourself: Does your title tag and meta description accurately summarize the content of your page?\n\nIf not, visitors may enter your site thinking your content is about one thing, only to find that it isn’t, and then bounce back to where they came from.\n\nWhether it was an innocent mistake or you were trying to game the system by optimizing for keyword clickbait (shame on you!), it is fortunately simple enough to fix.\n\nEither review the content of your page and adjust the title tag and meta description accordingly.\n\nOr, rewrite the content to address the search queries you want to attract visitors for.\n\nYou can also check what kind of meta description Google has auto-generated for your page for common searches – Google can change your meta description, and if they make it worse, you can take steps to remedy that.\n\n5. Blank Page Or Technical Error\n\nIf your bounce rate is exceptionally high and you see that people are spending less than a few seconds on the page, it’s likely your page is blank, returning a 404, or otherwise not loading properly.\n\nLook at the page from your audience’s most popular browser and device configurations (e.g., Safari on desktop and mobile, Chrome on mobile, etc.) to replicate their experience.\n\nYou can also check in Search Console under Coverage to discover the issue from Google’s perspective.\n\nCorrect the issue yourself or talk to someone who can – an issue like this can cause Google to drop your page from the search results in a hurry.\n\n6. Bad Link From Another Website\n\nYou could be doing everything perfectly on your end to achieve a normal or low bounce rate from organic search results, and still have a high bounce rate from your referral traffic.\n\nThe referring site could be sending you unqualified visitors or the anchor text and context of the link could be misleading.\n\nSometimes, this is a result of sloppy copywriting.\n\nThe writer or publisher linked to your site in the wrong part of the copy or didn’t mean to link to your site at all.\n\nReach out to the author of the article first.\n\nIf they don’t respond or they can’t update the article after publishing, then you can escalate the issue to the site’s editor or webmaster.\n\nPolitely ask them to remove the link to your site – or update the context, whichever makes sense.\n\n(Tip: You can easily find their contact information with this guide.)\n\nUnfortunately, the referring website may be trying to sabotage you with some negative SEO tactics out of spite or just for fun.\n\nFor example, they may have linked to your “Guide To Adopting A Puppy” with the anchor text of FREE GET RICH QUICK SCHEME.\n\nIn order to fix that issue, you need to exclude traffic from those spammy sources.\n\n7. Affiliate Landing Page Or Single-Page Site\n\nIf you’re an affiliate, the whole point of your page may be to deliberately send people away from your website to the merchant’s site.\n\nIn these instances, you’re doing the job right if the page has a higher bounce rate.\n\nA similar scenario would be if you have a single-page website, such as a landing page for your ebook or a simple portfolio site.\n\nIt’s common for sites like these to have a very high bounce rate since there’s nowhere else to go.\n\nRemember that Google can usually tell when a website is doing a good job satisfying user intent even if the user’s query is answered quickly (sites like WhatIsMyScreenResolution.org come to mind).\n\nIf you’ve set it up so that a click on your affiliate link is considered a conversion event, this type of session will not count as a bounce but instead as “engaged.”\n\n8. Low-Quality Or Underoptimized Content\n\nVisitors may be bouncing from your website because your content is just plain bad.\n\nTake a long, hard look at your page and have your most judgmental and honest colleague or friend review it.\n\n(Ideally, this person has a background in content marketing or copywriting. Bonus points if they belong to your target audience.)\n\nOne possibility is that your content is great, but you just haven’t optimized it for online reading – or the audience you’re targeting.\n\nAre you writing in simple sentences (think high school students versus PhDs)?\n\nIs it easily scannable with lots of header tags?\n\nDoes it cleanly answer questions?\n\nHave you included images to break up the copy and make it easy on the eyes?\n\nWriting for the web is different than writing for offline publications.\n\nBrush up your online copywriting skills to increase the time people spend reading your content.\n\nThe other possibility is that your content is poorly written overall or simply isn’t something your audience cares about.\n\nConsider hiring a freelance copywriter (like me!) or content strategist who can help you transform your ideas into powerful content that converts.\n\n9. Bad Or Obnoxious UX\n\nAre you bombarding people with ads, pop-up surveys, and email subscribe buttons?\n\nCTA-heavy features like these may be irresistible to the marketing and sales team, but using too many can make a visitor run for the hills.\n\nGoogle’s Core Web Vitals are all about user experience – not only are they ranking factors, but they impact your site visitors’ happiness, too.\n\nIs your site confusing to navigate?\n\nPerhaps your visitors are looking to explore more, but your blog is missing a search box, or the menu items are difficult to click on a smartphone.\n\nAs online marketers, we know our websites in and out.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that what seems intuitive to us is anything but to our audience.\n\nMake sure you’re avoiding these common design mistakes, and have a web or UX designer review the site and let you know if anything pops out to them as problematic.\n\n10. The Page Isn’t Mobile-Friendly\n\nWhile SEO pros know it’s important to have a mobile-friendly website, the practice isn’t always followed in the real world.\n\nGoogle announced its switch to mobile-first indexing way back in 2017, but many websites today still wouldn’t be considered mobile-friendly.\n\nWebsites that haven’t been optimized for mobile don’t look good on mobile devices – and they don’t load too fast, either.\n\nThat’s a recipe for a high bounce rate.\n\nEven if your website was implemented using responsive design principles, it’s still possible that the live page doesn’t read as mobile-friendly to the user.\n\nSometimes, when a page gets squeezed into a mobile format, it causes some of the key information to move below the fold.\n\nNow, instead of seeing a headline that matches what they saw in search, mobile users only see your site’s navigation menu.\n\nAssuming the page doesn’t offer what they need, they bounce back to Google.\n\nIf you see a page with a high bounce rate and no glaring issues immediately jump out to you, test it on your mobile phone.\n\nYou can also check for mobile issues in Google Search Console and Lighthouse.\n\n11. Content Depth\n\nGoogle can give people quick answers through featured snippets and knowledge panels.\n\nBut only you can give people deep, interesting, interconnected content that’s a step beyond that.\n\nMake sure your content compels people to click to explore other pages on your site if it makes sense.\n\nProvide interesting, relevant internal links, and give them a reason to stay.\n\nAnd for the crowd that wants the quick answer, give them a TL;DR summary at the top.\n\n12. Asking For Too Much\n\nDon’t ask someone for their credit card number, social security number, grandmother’s pension, or children’s names right off the bat (or ever, in some of those examples).\n\nYour user doesn’t trust you yet!\n\nPeople are ready to be suspicious when they click on a new website, considering the number of scam websites out there.\n\nBeing presented with a big pop-up asking for info will cause a lot of people to bounce immediately.\n\nYour job is to build trust with your visitors.\n\nDo so, and you’ll both be happier. Your visitors will feel like they can trust you, and you’ll have a lower bounce rate.\n\nEither way, if it makes users happy, Google likes it.\n\nTips For Reducing Your Bounce Rate\n\nRegardless of the reason behind your high bounce rate, here’s a summary of best practices you can implement to bring it down.\n\n1. Rework Your Title Tag and Meta Description\n\nIn some cases, your page might be awesome. You may have a perfect page design filled with all the elements your visitors are looking for.\n\nMaybe it’s a comprehensive how-to guide that’s well-written, well-organized, and tricked out with illustrative photos (maybe even video) and links to other relevant resources on your site.\n\nOr, for an ecommerce page, you’ve got a compelling product description, photos from your customers and your marketing team, user reviews, Q&A, and carousels of related products.\n\nThe only thing working against you is a mismatched title tag and/or meta description.\n\nIn these cases, your to-do list is short and sweet. Simply rewrite your meta tags so they match what’s on the page. Huzzah!\n\n2. Make Sure Your Content Lives Up To The Hype\n\nIn other cases, your title tag and meta description oversell your content.\n\nIn these situations, you need to rework your content to make sure it matches whatever you’re advertising in the search engine results pages (SERPs).\n\nDon’t call your page an “ultimate guide” if it’s a short post with three tips.\n\nDon’t claim to be the “best” vacuum if your user reviews show a three-star rating.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nAlso, make your content readable by:\n\nBreaking up your text with lots of white space.\n\nAdding supporting images.\n\nWriting in short sentences.\n\nUsing a good, clean design.\n\nNot bombarding visitors with too many ads.\n\nRemember: spellcheck is your friend!\n\n3. Keep Critical Elements Above The Fold\n\nSometimes, your content matches what you advertise in your title tag and meta description. It’s just that your visitors can’t tell at first glance.\n\nWhen people arrive on a website, they make an immediate first impression.\n\nYou want that first impression to validate whatever they thought they would see when they arrived.\n\nA prominent H1 should match the title they read on Google.\n\nIf it’s an ecommerce site, a photo should match the product description they saw on Google.\n\nAlso, make sure pop-ups or advertisements don’t obscure these elements.\n\n4. Minimize Non-Essential Elements\n\nDon’t bombard your visitors with pop-up ads, in-line promotions, and other content they don’t care about.\n\nVisual overwhelm can cause visitors to bounce.\n\nWhat CTA is the most important for the page? Compellingly highlight that.\n\nFor everything else, delegate it to your sidebar or footer.\n\nEdit, edit, edit!\n\n5. Help People Get Where They Want To Be Faster\n\nWant to encourage people to browse more of your site?\n\nMake it easy for them.\n\nLeverage on-site search with predictive search, helpful filters, and an optimized “no results found” page.\n\nRework your navigation menu and A/B test how complex vs. simple drop-down menus affect your bounce rate.\n\nIn your long-form articles, include a table of contents with anchor links that take readers straight to the section they want to read.\n\n6. When In Doubt, Test\n\nYou may not know what changes you need to make to fix your bounce rate.\n\nGuess what? That’s okay.\n\nUse A/B and multivariate testing to help you out.\n\nYou can experiment with different updates to see what your audience responds to. Test out different titles, headers, content, images, layouts, and designs.\n\nConclusion\n\nRemember: Bounce rates are just one metric of many, many, many SEO metrics you could be keeping track of.\n\nI’m getting tired just thinking about it!\n\nFortunately, Google Analytics is here to help you stay on track.\n\nWhatever your bounce rate is, it’s totally fixable.\n\nThere are steps you can take to bring it down to a more normal range while improving the experience for your users.\n\nSo, take some time today to optimize your website.\n\nReview your bounce rate for some core pages, and consider which of the tactics above will help nudge it in the right direction.\n\nGood luck!\n\nMore resources:\n\nHow To Optimize Website Architecture For SEO\n\n7 Strategic SEO Insights & Tactical Tips For 2024 And Beyond\n\nThe Complete Technical SEO Audit Workbook\n\nFeatured Image: eamesBot/Shutterstock"
