        "text": "Typically, a C/C++ app compiled with Visual Studio will use shared copies of Visual Studio's C runtime libraries.\n\nSo even though Visual Studio may not be installed, C/C++ apps built with a particular version will need the runtime libs for that version. Apps build with different versions, installed on the same computer, will require the matching runtime libs. Hence, different versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable.\n\nEvery other video game and many other things feel compelled to install their special version of it. You can't do anything about it, and if you take them off, something may stop working. It takes up a small amount of disk space, but apart from that, just leave it alone. If you need disk space, there are better ways to reclaim some of it.\n\nThis is a big miss on M$'s part. Nah, say it ain't so? Here, a simple backwards compatibility management and some interface rollups would keep it small yet allow old stuff to use the latest copy, or at worst, a few key versions would work for everything. Alas, they did not go that route when they designed it.\n\nLast edited on"
