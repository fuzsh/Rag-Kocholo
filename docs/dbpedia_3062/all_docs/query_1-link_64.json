        "text": "2023 was a banner year for movies. Filmmakers with personal, political, and unique views poured their souls into an array of films that broke formal conventions, turned the industry on its head, and proved that audiences still crave movies of substance and humanity. Unfortunately, the only thing people wanted to talk about was how movies are just too long. Well, all the people who found Martin Scorsese’s real-world account of human cruelty too long are finally getting what’s coming to them: An 80-minute movie about Jesus by 2023’s reigning king of long movies.\n\nThis is per a new interview for The L.A. Times. Scorsese says the film is a response to an appeal from none other than the pope, who compelled artists to make a movie about Jesus and get some butts in pews. The director says he based the screenplay on Silence author Shūsaku Endō’s book A Life Of Jesus and is “trying to find a new way to make [religion] more accessible” by focusing on the teachings of Jesus but doesn’t hit viewers over the head with them. He wants to “take away the negative onus of what has been associated with organized religion.” Namely, the assumption that services are just too long."
