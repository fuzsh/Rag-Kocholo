        "text": "Harrison v. Myer\n\n92 U.S. 111\n\nSyllabus\n\n1. Certain premises in Louisiana belonging to a citizen of that state were, during his absence therefrom, seized as abandoned property by the military authorities of the United States, who compelled the lessee then in possession to enter into a new lease and to pay to them the rent thereafter due. Held that the owner could not recover of the lessee the rent for the period during which he had paid it to the military authorities.\n\n2. Where suit was commenced Nov. 16, 1868, for rent claimed to be due up to Aug. 8, 1865, and where, throughout the whole intervening time, the district within which the cause of action, if any arose, was under the control of the federal authorities and the defendant could be served there with process, held that the decision of the supreme court of the state that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations is not subject to reexamination here."
