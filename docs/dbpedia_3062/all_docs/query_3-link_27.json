        "text": "As a marketer, I understand the importance of landing pages. A landing page can be the designated page visitors are taken to when they click on an ad.\n\nIt can also be the page that follows a call-to-action button or serve as the homepage of a website.\n\nRegardless of how my audience “lands” on a landing page, it encourages them to convert to a lead or customer. Hence, landing pages are uniquely powerful components of a business' digital marketing strategy.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is a landing page?\n\nHow to Create a Landing Page\n\nWhy do you need a landing page?\n\nLanding Page Best Practices\n\nHow to Design Your Landing Page\n\nLanding Page Copywriting Tips\n\nA/B Testing Your Landing Page\n\nLanding Page Metrics to Track\n\nHow to Make Your Landing Pages More Effective\n\nWhat to Do Post-Conversion: Lead Nurturing\n\nWhat is a landing page?\n\nA landing page is a website page with a specific purpose — the objective of a landing page is to convert visitors into leads. While there are many landing pages, the intent is the same — get more leads.\n\nLanding pages contain lead forms that ask visitors for their contact information in exchange for something of value, otherwise known as an offer.\n\nThe video below will help drive that definition home.\n\nHow to Create a Landing Page\n\nCreating a landing page doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some actionable, step-by-step instructions to help you create one.\n\n1. Define your goal and audience.\n\nBefore you start creating your landing page, you need to define your “why,” “who,” and “what.”\n\nWhy are you making this landing page?\n\nWhom do you want to visit your landing page?\n\nWhat steps do your landing page visitors have to take to help you achieve your goal?\n\nYour answers will guide the process of writing your copy, creating a lead magnet, and adding the necessary elements to your page.\n\nFor example, say the reason you’re making your landing page is to generate leads for your upcoming book launch (your “why”). This means that you’ll be targeting people who love to read books in your genre (your “who”).\n\nAnd to get them on your email list, you’ll have them fill out a form once they land on your page (your “what”).\n\nHere are some CTAs you can use on your landing page to collect leads:\n\nSubscribe to a newsletter.\n\nDownload a free ebook/guide.\n\nSign up for a free trial.\n\nRegister for a webinar.\n\nDownload a coupon.\n\nPro tip: To get the most results from your landing page, stick to one goal (or one CTA). Not only does this make it much easier to create an effective landing page, but it also reduces the amount of work your visitors have to do when they arrive on your page.\n\n2. Choose a platform.\n\nAfter setting your goal and defining your audience, the next step is to select the platform you’ll use to create your landing page.\n\nYou can use popular content management systems like WordPress and Wix or dedicated landing page builders like Unbounce or Leadpages.\n\nUnbounce and Leadpages, however, can be really expensive, and while WordPress and Wix are free, you’ll likely have to pay for functional landing page templates — which isn’t feasible if you’re new to creating landing pages.\n\nYou can work around this problem by using HubSpot’s Free Landing Page Builder.\n\nThis tool has the following features:\n\nA WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that makes it easy to build stunning, yet professional, landing pages.\n\nAn extensive landing page template library so you don’t have to create a landing page from scratch.\n\nBuilt-in personalization so you can tailor your page’s content to fit your target audience.\n\nAI copywriting tools that help you generate compelling copy in just a few seconds;\n\nRobust analytics so you know who’s visiting your landing page and what they do when they get there.\n\nIntegration with Salesforce and HubSpot’s CRM tools so you can manage the leads your page generates.\n\nWith this tool, you can build beautiful, effective, and mobile-responsive landing pages for free. You can also test and optimize these pages yourself. No previous IT experience required.\n\n3. Customize your landing page design.\n\nIf you choose to use a landing page template, you should customize the design to match your brand. This includes the colors, fonts, layout, and visuals. Here are some tips to help you with customization:\n\nChoose a captivating hero image (the large image that’s typically in the area above the fold, right underneath the website header) that shows visitors what your offer is about.\n\nUse images (product images and stock photos) and illustrations to show the benefits and values that your visitors will gain from your image. Let these visuals tell a story.\n\nIf applicable, include real photographs of people using your product/service (e.g., reading your book, using your face lotion, etc.) to help your landing page visitors connect with you on a personal level.\n\nUse a color palette that’s a mixture of bright colors and muted tones to create balance and make your overall design more memorable.\n\nOptimize your images for web loading speed. If not, they might bog down your landing page and make it load very slowly.\n\n4. Write compelling copy.\n\nAfter customizing your landing page website, it’s time to include some actual content in it.\n\nThe first step to writing landing page copy is to structure it; the typical structure involves a headline, a tagline, the actual copy, visuals (images and videos) and a CTA.\n\nAn engaging headline and image can be crucial, but experience has shown me that it can fall flat without well-crafted copy. Your copy must be clear and concise and guide your visitors to the action you want them to complete.\n\nCompelling copy also speaks directly to the visitor using “you” and “your” to engage them. We’ll go more in-depth on copy tips below.\n\nPro tip: Speed up the writing process by using generative AI to create a rough draft of your landing page copy and refine it to match your brand voice and tone.\n\nWith Campaign Assistant, HubSpot users can plug in their main points, features, and CTA and generate a first draft in seconds.\n\n5. Add a persuasive call-to-action (CTA).\n\nAfter telling your visitors all about your product/service and how they can benefit from it, you’ll need to show them the action you want them to take.\n\nThis is your call-to-action (CTA), and it is arguably the most crucial element on your landing page — it’s one of many elements that encourage conversion.\n\nIt’s usually in the form of a click-through button, which should stand out on the page, meaning you should use a color contrasting with other elements on the page.\n\nThe call-to-action (CTA) should clearly explain what you want visitors to do; that is, use an action verb that spells it out for them, like “submit,” “download,” or “get it now.” More on CTA best practices below.\n\n6. Create a form (if needed).\n\nSometimes, a CTA button alone would not suffice, especially if you’re targeting different kinds of people with the same landing page. In this case, you’ll need to create a form, like this:\n\nBefore creating one, however, determine what information you need from visitors. If you only need their full name and email address, ask for those only.\n\nDon’t ask for their phone number, home address, company name, and job title unless you absolutely need this information to tailor offers to them correctly.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to approach this, remember: shorter is better.\n\nIn July 2023, we surveyed 101 marketers and advertisers in the U.S. to learn about trends in landing pages. Of respondents, 30.7% said the ideal number of questions on a landing page form to get the best conversions is four.\n\nImage Source\n\nBeyond that, 10.9% of marketers report only the name and email are essential for a landing page form.\n\nPro tip: Connect your form to your email marketing and CRM tool to manage and nurture your leads.\n\n7. Test and preview.\n\nNow, you’re ready to launch your landing page!\n\nBut before you do that, though, do a final check to ensure that everything looks and functions the way they’re supposed to on the landing page.\n\nCheck your copy and ensure that there are no grammatical or spelling errors that will make a bad impression on your audience.\n\nAlso, check your design to ensure that all elements are correctly placed and formatted. Verify that all links, forms, and buttons work as expected.\n\nThen, make sure that the contact information of visitors who click your CTA button is safely situated in your email marketing and/or CRM tool.\n\nWhen you’ve confirmed that everything is as it should be, click “Publish.”\n\n8. Monitor and optimize.\n\nYou thought we were done, right? Not quite.\n\nAfter publishing your landing page, you shouldn’t just forget it; instead, monitor and test it to figure out ways to continue improving upon your landing page elements. The best way to do this is through A/B testing.\n\nSome important elements you should run experiments on include:\n\nThe headline. Try different headlines to see which one resonates best with your audience.\n\nVisuals. Change the hero image and other illustrations you use on your landing page.\n\nForm. If you have a form on your landing page, change the number of form fields and the form placement to see which one(s) convert better.\n\nCTA. Design a different CTA button and tweak the accompanying copy and bit to see which one visitors click on more.\n\nWhen you conduct these tests and implement your results, you’ll be able to get the best out of your landing page, no matter what your goal is.\n\nPro tip: Also analyze performance metrics and user feedback, and make necessary adjustments to improve the effectiveness of your landing page over time.\n\nWhy do you need a landing page?\n\nWhy would you create a unique page for people to complete a form? Why not just use your homepage or About page?\n\nStill, the short answer is this: A landing page eliminates distractions by removing navigation, competing links, and alternate options so you capture your visitor’s undivided attention.\n\nComplete attention means you can guide your visitors where you’d like them to go, i.e., to your lead form. In sum, landing pages are specifically designed to create conversions.\n\nOur July 2023 survey found that the average landing page conversion rate across all industries is 5.89%. If you’re seeing conversions beyond 10%, you’re hitting (and exceeding) this benchmark. We found that 43.6% reported generating leads as their goal, while 33.7% said direct customer purchase is their top priority.\n\nBeyond that, landing pages are working. Of marketers, 33.7% saw higher conversion rates in 2023 than in 2022.\n\nNow that you understand their importance, let’s cover landing page best practices to ensure your pages are set up to convert.\n\nWas that a lot? I’ll break down these landing page best practices below.\n\n1. Craft a benefit-focused headline.\n\nOver the years, I've learned that for every 10 people visiting a landing page, at least seven will bounce off the page. To keep that number low, visitors must understand what’s in it for them within seconds of arriving.\n\nMy headline is the first thing they’ll read, and it should clearly and concisely communicate the value of my landing page and offer. The same goes for your own landing page, so craft a clear, direct, and engaging headline.\n\n2. Choose an image that illustrates the offer.\n\nI always include images in my landing pages. The purpose of an image is to convey a feeling — it should illustrate how visitors will feel once they receive the offer.\n\nSpecific images may work better than others, so you should always split-test your options (which we’ll cover below).\n\n3. Include the lead form above the fold.\n\nYour lead form needs to be readily accessible should your prospect want to convert immediately — you don’t want them searching and scanning your landing page to find your offer.\n\n“Above the fold” means visitors don’t have to scroll to get to the form — it’s in view when someone hits the page.\n\nThis could be a form or an anchor link to the form. Even better: Design your layout to scroll with the user as they move down the page.\n\n4. Give away a relevant offer.\n\nThink of your landing page as part of your lead’s journey to your ultimate offer — your product or service. Your offer is the thing you give in exchange for your lead’s personal information.\n\nNot only should it be compelling enough for your visitor to provide their contact info, but it should also be relevant to your business. Say you sell horseshoes.\n\nYour offer might be something like “10 Simple Ways to Size Your Horse’s Hooves” because, ultimately, you will ask that lead to buy your horseshoes.\n\nYou wouldn’t hook them with an offer about organic farming because that puts them on a different path.\n\nWe’ll talk more about how compelling offers are below.\n\n5. Only ask for what you need.\n\nYou want to gather as much information as possible about your lead, but how much you ask for depends on several factors: how well-acquainted they are with you, where they are in their buyer’s journey, and how much they trust you.\n\nAsk for as little info as you need in your lead form to create a low barrier to entry. A name and an email are more than sufficient to nurture a new lead.\n\n6. Remove all navigation.\n\nYour landing page has one objective and one objective only: to convert visitors into leads. Any competing links — including internal links to other pages on your website — will distract from that goal.\n\nRemove other links on your page to draw your visitors’ attention to your call to action.\n\n7. Make your page responsive.\n\nLike every other page on your website, your landing pages must be responsive to accommodate every viewing experience. The last thing you need is for your form to fall out of view on mobile devices.\n\nGive your visitors every possible opportunity to convert, no matter how they view your page.\n\nYou can use tools to help accomplish this. For example, HubSpot's drag-and-drop landing page editor, available in Marketing Hub Starter, makes creating mobile-optimized landing pages and forms effortlessly easy.\n\n8. Optimize for search.\n\nSure, you’ll be driving visitors to your landing page through email blasts, social posts, and other marketing methods, but your page should also be optimized with target keywords for your paid campaigns and organic search.\n\nWhen someone searches for your key phrase, they should find your landing page. Similarly, when you target a keyword with paid ads, those words should exist on your landing page.\n\n9. Remember to use a thank you page.\n\nA thank you page is where you send leads once they’ve completed your form. Now, you could just show a thank you message on the same page or ditch the thank you altogether, but there are many reasons why that’s not the best option.\n\nA thank you page serves three essential purposes:\n\nIt delivers the offer that you promised (usually in the form of an instant download).\n\nIt allows you to interest your new lead in additional relevant content.\n\nIt serves as a chance to thank them for their interest, which goes a long way in promoting them to a customer.\n\nHow to Design Your Landing Page\n\nOften, design means creativity, colors, and pretty pictures. We take design a step further for a landing page to mean functional, direction-oriented, and practical.\n\nSo, to craft a well-designed landing page, you’ll have to tap into both your right and left brain.\n\nBut don’t get me wrong — you still need fantastic imagery and attractive colors to convert your visitors. We’ll touch on how to incorporate all of this below.\n\nLanding Page Structure\n\nOften, design means creativity, colors, and pretty pictures. We take design a step further for a landing page to mean functional, direction-oriented, and practical.\n\nSo, to craft a well-designed landing page, you’ll have to tap into both your right and left brain.\n\nBut don’t get me wrong — you still need fantastic imagery and attractive colors to convert your visitors. We’ll touch on how to incorporate all of this below.\n\nLanding Page Structure\n\nThe good news is you don’t need to get too creative here. I've found that most landing pages follow a very similar structure because it’s been proven to work.\n\nYou can infuse your creativity through branded elements and images, but stick to a landing page format people are used to seeing.\n\nA good landing page has five elements (check out the landing page example below to see these elements in practice):\n\nHeadline that grabs the visitors' attention.\n\nRelevant image that is relevant to your audience.\n\nLead form that sits above the fold to capture visitors’ information.\n\nCTA that is action-oriented and compelling.\n\nCopy and description that informs and entices your visitor to complete your form.\n\nImage Source\n\nCan your landing page include more than this? Absolutely. (Think of social share buttons visitors can use to spread the word about your offer). This is simply the bare minimum.\n\nYou need to know your audience, where they are coming from, and where they are in their buyer’s journey to understand how much you need to include. The rule of thumb is to have as much information as you need to get people to convert.\n\nLanding Page Layout\n\nTrust me when I say most people don’t read every word of your cleverly crafted copy. Instead, they skim through and pull out the most important tidbits. Your job is to make those tidbits stand out so your visitor doesn’t miss anything important.\n\nThat means a few things …\n\nKeep the most important information above the fold so your visitor doesn’t need to scroll to get to it.\n\nPerform a blink test on your page, meaning a visitor should be able to gather the main message in less time than it takes them to blink, i.e., less than five seconds.\n\nUse white (or unfavorable) space to keep your visitors engaged and focused and to help them comprehend your message.\n\nWrite with bullets and short paragraphs to make your copy easy to digest.\n\nTry to work the critical copy into anF-pattern, which is the direction that most people scan a page online. Work with the flow of visual patterns to drive people to the key points that will get them to convert.\n\nLanding Page Colors\n\nThe design of your landing page — including the colors you use — should reflect that of your website.\n\nYou’re aiming to form a long-term relationship with the people who visit your landing page, which means they need to become familiar with your branding colors and unique style.\n\nThe more they recognize your brand, the more they trust you (and the more they trust you, the easier it is to get them to do what you want them to do).\n\nThe areas where you should consider using alternate colors are on the elements of your page that need to stand out — ahem, your CTA button.\n\nContrast is the name of the game here. Say your branded colors are primarily green; you’ll want to choose a color that can draw users' attention, say purple.\n\nWhat colors perform well? We did a little research for you to determine which colors convert best.\n\nLanding Page Images\n\nThe image on your landing page is one the first things people see, and since people process visuals far quicker than text, it sets the tone for their entire experience.\n\nBut how can you choose between millions of stock photos and that company photo shoot that’s taking up all the space on your computer?\n\nLet’s narrow down the selection with a few essential questions:\n\nWho is my target audience?\n\nWhat does your persona look like? How old are they? How do they dress? What are they interested in?\n\nThe answers to these questions are important in determining what image you will place front and center on your landing page.\n\nIf it will appeal to your audience, it needs to represent them somehow.\n\nWhere on my landing page do I want them to look?\n\nThis might seem odd, but it’s based on the idea that people follow directional cues, like where someone is looking or pointing. If you want visitors to fill out a form, consider an image that drives their attention toward that form.\n\nWill this image reinforce my message?\n\nEvery element on your landing page serves an essential purpose.\n\nSince your image is one of the first things people see, it should help clarify what visitors can expect from your page. Make sure that your image adds value.\n\nHere are other important things to consider when creating excellent landing page images.\n\nCall-to-Action (CTA)\n\nWe’ve discussed your CTA a few times, but since it’s the most crucial part of your landing page, it’s worth mentioning again.\n\nWhen it comes to the design of your CTA, there are a few tricks that will make it so alluring that visitors feel compelled to click.\n\nTo clarify, your CTA includes the button and the copy you use to draw attention to it; these tips cover both.\n\nGive your CTA a vibrant and contrasting color.\n\nFocus your CTA copy on the benefit to your visitor.\n\nGet to the point — try using no more than five words.\n\nTell your visitors what you want them to do using action verbs (e.g., Get, Download, Click, etc.).\n\nMake your button large enough to stand out on the page.\n\nGive it some negative space — don’t crowd the area around your CTA.\n\nFollow the flow of the page and place your CTA where your readers’ eyes will go, such as to the right of or below the copy.\n\nTest your button shape, test your copy. As a matter of fact, test everything (we’ll cover how to do this below).\n\nBeyond that, consider personalizing your CTA. HubSpot research found that personalized CTAs convert 202% better than default versions.\n\nImage Source\n\nMobile Landing Page\n\nMore than half of website traffic comes from mobile devices; therefore, the user experience should be the same regardless of the device visitors use.\n\nBy making your landing page responsive, you give them every opportunity to view and convert, whether on a desktop, phone, tablet, or otherwise.\n\nLanding Page Copywriting Tips\n\nAfter design comes excellent copy; your objective is to be compelling, instructive, likable, concise, effective, trustworthy, and informative. How? Keep reading.\n\n1. Cover the main points.\n\nNo matter how you position it, there are a few main points that you need to hit with your copy.\n\nThose main points are your persona’s pain point, the solution to that pain point, how your solution works (features), how your solution will improve their situation (benefits), and verification that it works (social proof).\n\nMost of what you write needs to address how you can help your prospect, not how awesome you are (because that’s implied). Let’s go into more depth on these points.\n\nThe Pain Point\n\nThe pain point that you focus on should be the one that your offer solves. Not to sound negative, but it’s important to touch on the problem your persona is facing so they know you understand what they’re going through.\n\nEmpathy is an effective way to build trust. And if they know you get their problem, they’re more likely to trust your solution.\n\nYour Solution\n\nThe solution to their pain point is what you’re offering in exchange for their information. Illustrate a clear path between their problem and how your solution is the remedy they need.\n\nFeatures\n\nKnowing your solution may not be enough to convert leads, so you need to mention what’s included in that solution. If it’s an ebook, what are the subjects you cover?\n\nIf you’re promoting a webinar, how will it work, and what will you teach?\n\nIf it’s a service, what can they expect? Give your potential lead all the information they need to make a decision.\n\nBenefits\n\nYour copy should be heavy with benefits to the user because that’s what they care about — what’s in it for them. While features list what your offer has, benefits tell visitors how their situation will be improved.\n\nUsing your solution paints a vivid picture of how much better their life could be.\n\nSocial Proof\n\nStudies show that social proof is adequate for persuading people to take a desired action.\n\nSocial proof comes in the form of logos of brands you’ve worked with, testimonials from previous clients, reviews of your product, or confirmation that others have purchased your service.\n\nIn essence, people also want to know that others have used and benefited from your solution. You validate your offer without saying anything by including social proof on your landing page.\n\nImage Source\n\nTouching on each of these points will provide you with well-rounded copy that answers all of your visitors’ questions, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. Preemptively respond to objections.\n\nA key part of writing persuasive copy (copy that gets people to convert) is dismantling objections before they even come up. Now, this takes some skill … or at least some help from a friend.\n\nOnce you’ve laid your foundation by addressing all the main points, put yourself in your prospect's mind and think about where they might protest or challenge you as they read.\n\nFor instance, if you say, “We’ve helped Fortune 500 companies bring in customers,” your reader might scoff or doubt it unless you follow that statement with social proof.\n\nDo this exercise for every section of your page (or ask an unbiased friend to help) until you’ve covered every possible objection. When you get questions from people visiting your landing page, use that as feedback to further sharpen your copy.\n\nTo ensure your landing page meets every need, seek constructive criticism from your first few converted leads.\n\n3. Build trust with your prospect.\n\nYou read a sales page, and the company wrote, “Our product has helped 100 people, and it might work for you, too!” Meh. I’d probably pass and find a company with a solution that can work for me.\n\nYour goal is to build trust with your visitor, and the way to do that is to come across as an authority.\n\nBesides using social proof, some other ways to build trust are:\n\nWrite how you speak and address your prospects like a live customer.\n\nCite statistics that support your message.\n\nUse case studies that highlight customers similar to your target.\n\nBe relatable. Show your audience that you’re human by admitting failures, opening up about doubts you’ve had, and being honest. The caveat is you should only share what is relevant to their struggle; don’t just divulge anything.\n\n4. Use click triggers.\n\nClick triggers eliminate that last bit of doubt before a visitor converts. You can think of them as lick Probability Enhancers (yes, I made up that term).\n\nThey are copy-positioned next to your CTA, which pushes your prospect over the edge by easing their mind and mitigating the risk of converting.\n\nBelow are some practical ways to employ click triggers:\n\nMoney-back guarantee.\n\nEasy unsubscribe.\n\nQuote from a successful or happy customer.\n\nBlurb on “what to expect.”\n\nPrice slashing.\n\nPrivacy policy.\n\nSome other creative method.\n\nImage Source\n\nWhatever you choose, click triggers will give your conversions the boost they need.\n\nA/B Testing Your Landing Page\n\nEverything we’ve discussed until this point is great…in theory.\n\nHowever, your business differs from others, and your target audience is unique. How do you know if the copy you chose is working?\n\nOr if your CTA placement is correct? Or what colors perform best?\n\nOr which image to choose?\n\nYou test it. That’s how. Split testing (or A/B testing) is probably nothing new to you as a marketer, and split testing your landing page is just one more experiment to add to your list.\n\nLet’s briefly go over how to best A/B test your landing pages.\n\nWhat is A/B testing?\n\nA/B testing simply splits your traffic into two (or more) page variations to see which performs better.\n\nWhile you could do this manually by launching one take for some time, then another for the same amount of time, it’s far more efficient to use software that allows you to split test and track your results.\n\nThe main components of an A/B test are variants, or the two versions of the page, the champion, or the original page, and the challenger, or the page you modified to test against the original.\n\nHow to A/B Test\n\nThe most essential trick to split testing is minor tweaks with each experiment.\n\nFor instance, you don’t want to split-test your headline and image simultaneously because you won’t know which element garnered the results.\n\nFor this reason, stick to testing one element at a time. If the “winner” becomes your champion, you can create a new challenger to test the next element.\n\nYou repeat this cycle until you reach a conversion rate that you’re happy with (and that falls within realistic expectations, which we’ll cover below).\n\nWhat should you test?\n\nYou can test virtually anything on your landing page. But while that’s possible, you may want to limit your test to a few of the most impactful elements of your page, like:\n\nHeadline copy.\n\nImage.\n\nCTA color.\n\nClick triggers.\n\nCopy on the page.\n\nLead form length and fields.\n\nThese tests will have the most significant impact on your conversion rates. Try starting with the simplest change, like a headline or CTA color, then work your way to the more significant undertakings, like your page copy.\n\nLanding Page Metrics to Track\n\nMetrics will tell you everything you need to know about how well your landing page is performing and give you some insight into improving it. It’s hard to know exactly what will work when you launch a page.\n\nMeasure and track meticulously in the beginning until you reach a relatively good conversion rate; then, you can track your metrics less frequently.\n\nPage Visits\n\nHow many visits are you getting on your landing page? The more visits, the more you increase your probability of conversions. Adjust your paid strategy or redefine your keywords to drive more traffic to your page.\n\nYou can also inform your current followers about your offer through emails, social media, and your website.\n\nTraffic Source\n\nKnowing where your traffic is coming from will let you know where to double down or ditch your efforts. Most marketers have a landing page promotion strategy. (In fact, only 3% don’t). Here’s where they invest their efforts:\n\n7.9% — link building.\n\n32.7% — paid advertising.\n\n43.6% — email marketing.\n\n5.9% — podcast promotion.\n\n13.9% — YouTube promotion.\n\n51.5% — social media promotion.\n\n28.7% — Internal links in blog posts.\n\n35.6% — search engine optimization.\n\n17.8% — Partner/affiliate marketing.\n\n20.8% — CTAs and banner advertisements on the website.\n\nSubmission Rate\n\nThis is the number of people who have completed your lead form and landed on your thank you page. You can tweak your page to increase this number, but make sure to A/B test so you know what’s working.\n\nContacts\n\nContacts refer to the number of leads that you generate from your form. This differs from submissions because duplicate contacts are only counted once, meaning if a current lead fills out your form to get your offer, they don’t affect the count.\n\nHeat Mapping\n\nThis is more of an observation of how people interact with your page than a metric. Heat mapping can show where people scroll, what they read, and how they engage with your page. This is all valuable data when thinking about your page layout and structure.\n\nBounce Rate\n\nIf visitors are coming to your page and leaving immediately, you must examine whether the content aligns with the offer. Does your copy capture visitors’ attention, and do visitors automatically know what to do when they land on your page?\n\nIs your page a reflection of the copy you used to get people to visit it?\n\nForm Abandonment\n\nThis metric tells how many people start filling out your form but don’t complete it. If this number is particularly high, some adjustments to consider are introducing new click triggers, shortening your form, or making it more transparent what you want your visitor to do.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nYou must judge your landing page against industry norms and across a similar audience to know if it’s performing as expected. Check out some industry benchmarks to set as your baseline, but don’t be discouraged by other company’s results.\n\nNo matter what’s going on, diagnosing and healing your landing pages is possible if you pay attention to the metrics.\n\nHow to Make Your Landing Pages More Effective\n\nThere are always tweaks you can make to boost landing page performance. Below are a few great tips to get your landing pages leveled up.\n\nOptimize your landing page.\n\nOptimize is such a confusing word, isn’t it? Are we talking about imagery, copy, keywords, or UI? The answer is yes — we’re talking about all of it. Optimize just means to make your landing page the best it can be, and that can include a myriad of modifications.\n\nYou'll need a pretty expansive guide if you want to know everything you can do to optimize your landing page. And, guess what, we have one here.\n\nPresent an outstanding offer.\n\nYou could argue that anything free qualifies as “good,” but that isn’t exactly true. Not only should your offer be free (we’re not talking sales pages here), but it must also be good enough to warrant a stranger giving you their personal information.\n\nLet’s face it — many companies are competing for your audience’s attention, asking for their information and soliciting them via email. So, what’s going to make you stand out from the pack? An outstanding offer, that’s what.\n\nHere are a few questions to determine if you have a compelling offer or not:\n\nDoes my offer solve a pain point for my target audience?\n\nIs there a clear benefit that a lead can gain from this offer?\n\nCan my offer rival the competition?\n\nDecrease page load time.\n\nA single-second delay in page load time means 7% fewer conversions and 11% fewer page views. Slow page load times can also result in customer dissatisfaction and frustration.\n\nLanding page load time is a metric to take seriously. If you need some tips, check out this resource on decreasing page load time.\n\nKeep the buyer’s journey in mind.\n\nSince you’re driving traffic to your landing page, you should know where your visitors are in their buyer’s journey. That means you’ll see if they’re trying to diagnose a problem (awareness), looking for a solution to their problem (consideration), or are ready to close (decision).\n\nYour copy and offer should reflect this if you want to convert. It’s no different from other marketing materials — meet your visitors where they are.\n\nCreate a seamless experience.\n\nNo one should be surprised when they arrive on your landing page. It should be exactly as advertised, meaning it should be consistent with your copy.\n\nUse the exact words on your landing page that you used to get people to arrive there, whether it was a paid ad, social post, blog CTA, or email. If you want people to stick around, you must avoid the bait and switch at all costs.\n\nCreate a clear path to conversion.\n\nThere should be no guesswork involved in navigating your landing page. Once someone arrives on your page, what you want them to do should be clear — submit their info to your lead form. Your goal is to guide visitors to your form using creative directional cues.\n\nHere are some ways to point your visitor to a conversion:\n\nChoose an image of a person that is either gazing in the direction of or meaning to your form.\n\nMake your CTA a contrasting color to draw attention to it.\n\nUse arrows that point to your lead form.\n\nInsert anchor text that brings people back to the form when clicked.\n\nGive your CTA some negative space on the page.\n\nFrame your lead form with a bold color or outline.\n\nAdd scarcity to your offer.\n\nFew emotional marketing tactics work, as well as fear and the fear of missing out (more formally known as FOMO).\n\nConsumers don’t like to lose their ability to choose, and once you make it clear that your offer is in high demand and/or short supply, they’re going to clamber to get it.\n\nThe other reason this technique works is that people want things that are hard to obtain — that signifies value and exclusivity.\n\nTo show scarcity, mention how little of your offer is left, include a countdown timer, and use words like “ends soon” or “last chance.” We want you to be genuine, so only employ actual tactics for your business.\n\nBottom line: There are many ways to use and benefit from this technique.\n\nUse video.\n\nRecent HubSpot research found that 38.6% of marketers said video is the #1 landing page element that impacts conversion.\n\nVideo marketing is becoming increasingly popular for good reason. Not only do customers prefer to see videos from companies, but 88% of video marketers say that video gives them positive ROI.\n\nThe key is to create a compelling video that doesn’t distract visitors from your ultimate goal: the call to action. If you’re on the fence about using video, here are some reasons that might push you over the ledge:\n\nIncreases conversion rates.\n\nIt is a more personable way to share a message and connect with prospects.\n\nIt can be more engaging than an image and will get visitors in the habit of clicking (and converting).\n\nCan reduce the number of support calls or tickets you receive.\n\nIt is processed 60,000 times faster than text.\n\nIf you plan to employ this tactic, VidYard has some helpful landing page video guidelines to follow.\n\nAre you excited yet about how you can improve your landing pages? Sure, there are quite a few, but that just means that a poor-performing landing page doesn’t have to stay that way. Take it one tactic at a time and build as needed.\n\nWhat to Do Post-Conversion: Lead Nurturing\n\nSo, you have an optimized landing page that converts like a charm. Now what? You don’t want to leave those leads hanging. Instead, you want to nurture them into becoming customers, then nurture them more. Here’s how.\n\nOptimize your thank you page.\n\nI hope you’re not tired of optimizing yet. Your thank you page is the first thing someone sees after they convert, so it is an excellent opportunity to delight your new lead even more than you already have.\n\nYour objective is twofold: deliver your promised offer and get them interested in something else on your site.\n\nYour thank you page should:\n\nThank your new lead (go figure)\n\nProvide links to relevant content on your site\n\nInvite your lead to follow you on social media\n\nAsk your lead to subscribe to your blog\n\nAutomate a follow-up email with the offer\n\nGuide them along their buyer's journey.\n\nYour new lead will make their way to the decision stage with or without you. You want to be the one to help them get there. You’ve gathered valuable information about your lead to anticipate what they need next.\n\nProvide content or resources to bring them to the subsequent stage of their journey; you might just be their option for the decision stage. After all, we know that prospects buy from companies that they know, like, and trust.\n\nForm a relationship.\n\nOnce someone signs up to receive information from you, they become a potential customer with whom you should work hard to build a relationship and connection.\n\nThe good thing is you already know what they’re interested in and their pain points, so you can target them with additional, helpful content and personalized marketing.\n\nGrow Better with Landing Pages\n\nLanding pages will account for most of your new leads, demanding your attention. With the many tweaks, additions, and variations you can implement, there’s no reason you can’t have a landing page that converts well.\n\nAs long as you follow the best practices we covered above, you’ll be on your way to a high-performing landing page.\n\nEditor's note: This post was originally published in August 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness."
