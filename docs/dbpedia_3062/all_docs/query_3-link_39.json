        "text": "The results overwhelmingly found that Singaporean consumers have a strong desire for bank-embedded insurance offers, an opportunity to more effectively connect their digital activities to an existing relationship in an economy undergoing an accelerated shift to digitization. The growing demand for embedded insurance also presents a challenge that “bancassurance” partnerships between traditional insurance models — where offers are divorced from underlying activities — cannot solve: 83% of Singaporean digital bank customers would be highly interested in receiving embedded insurance offers based on their transaction data, as would 62% of traditional bank customers. ‘Convenience’ is the primary driver for their interest, stated by 58%.\n\nThe research aligns with data across the globe that points to significant demand for timely and relevant transaction-based insurance offers, with the majority of consumers showing extremely high preferences if they’ve recently made big purchases or had major life events especially. Notably the data shows that the traditional ‘second step’ of insurance distribution is outdated and not aligned with the expectations of an increasingly digitized customer base. 86% of Singaporeans who chose a traditional insurance models in the last 12 months would prefer bank-embedded offers for next time."
