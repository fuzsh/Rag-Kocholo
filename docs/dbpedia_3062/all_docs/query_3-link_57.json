        "text": "Email subject lines tend to get all the spotlight whenever someone talks about good email marketing – but the preview text can be just as important.\n\nPreview text is as valuable real estate as the front porch of a nice house. Where the subject line gets the attention of users, good preview text makes them want to commit to opening your email. After that, it's all a curiosity slope.\n\nOr, as Joseph Sugarman put it, \"Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slope.”\n\nSo how do you write a preview text that gets your readers and keeps them interested enough to read through your email? And should preview texts have a specific length for a good user experience?\n\nRead our guide on writing preview texts your audience will resonate with.\n\nWhat is the preview text?\n\nAn email preview text is a snippet of information meant to describe your email, displayed as a preview in the inbox. Most major email clients will show the preview next to the subject line, to draw the audience's attention and increase email open rates.\n\nThe preview helps intrigue the recipient before they open the email and should be short and sweet, typically between 40 and 140 characters, depending on the email client.\n\nTake abandoned cart emails, for example. While most people are used to the traditional \"Hey, you forgot something in your cart\", the white space right next to the subject line can be an opportunity to remind people why they added the item in the first place.\n\nPreview texts like \"We really like your taste in dresses, {name},\" \"Here's a coupon code to help you out,\" or \"Your new fit self is waiting!\" can entice users to click on the email, look at the product again, and finish the transaction. A simple tactic like this can reduce cart abandonment, increase engagement, and potentially boost sales.\n\nCan you skip the preview text?\n\nIs skipping the preview text a good idea?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to overlook this small detail, doing so could negatively impact your email marketing efforts. The preview text is valuable for engaging subscribers and convincing them to open your emails.\n\nIf you skip the preview text, email clients usually generate a default snippet based on the first few lines of your email. This likely won't capture the essence of your message or entice your audience to read further.\n\nCrafting preview text gives you control over what your subscribers see in their inbox, allowing you to adjust the text to your tone of voice and deliver the right message to your audience.\n\nMany digital marketers use the same text for the subject line and the preview, but that's not necessarily the best way to go about it. You should look at your preview text as valuable space – it's extra room to get your potential customers more interested in your deals.\n\nInvesting time and effort in creating captivating preview text can lead to higher open rates and better engagement. In other words, if you're not using a smart preview text, you're leaving customers in front of your store instead of inviting them in.\n\nAdvantages of adding a preview text\n\nWhether you're a B2C or B2B marketer, you should consider preview texts as an integral part of your email copywriting strategies. Here's why:\n\nBoost in open rates and click-through rates. Research shows that using preview text can boost click-through rates by a staggering 30%. Makes sense, right? Compelling preview text significantly boosts open rates by capturing subscribers' interest and motivating them to explore your content further.\n\nBetter inbox presence. Preview texts provide more context to your subscribers. For instance, they can highlight critical insight or a call to action (CTA) to improve click-through rates, as well as present your tone of voice to increase your brand recognition.\n\nVisibility on mobile. 41.6% of email opens happen on mobile devices, with webmail coming in second at 40.6% and desktop platforms accounting for 16.2%.Thus, mobile optimization is key. With high visibility on mobile devices, a preview text ensures your message reaches your (likely growing) mobile audience.\n\nMoreover, well-structured preview text can reduce spam complaints. When they understand the email’s purpose, recipients will be less likely to mark it as spam. Instead, they will receive more effective email campaigns, fostering a stronger connection with your band, and ultimately leading to improved customer experience.\n\nDifference between preheader and preview text\n\nBoth preheaders and preview texts have a similar goal: to get people to click on the CTA button. However, they're placed in different areas of your email and frequently use different copywriting techniques to engage readers.\n\nPreheader text\n\nIn a nutshell, the preheader text is the text your email subscribers see just above the header area in your email – after they've clicked on the subject line and opened it. While they may be useful, preheader texts are less common in most emails these days, largely because the extra space above the email header is used for branding and user experience-related purposes.\n\nPreview text\n\nIn contrast, preview text appears in the inbox view next to the subject line and it can be an excellent way to connect your subject line with the actual email content.\n\nWhat should the preview text include?\n\nYou can use preview text to provide additional information, such as the main headlines in a publication, a summary or your email, or a hint at a curiosity gap. For example, if the subject line says, “50% off new arrivals”, the preview text might mention how long the offer will be available and create a sense of urgency in shoppers.\n\nTo craft an appealing preview text, you should\n\nHighlight the email’s main point: Convey the primary message or offer to give people a reason to open the email.\n\nIncite curiosity: Pique the reader’s interest by hinting at valuable content or exclusive information without giving everything away.\n\nHow to add preview texts to your emails\n\nAdding a preview text to your emails depends mainly on the email service provider (ESP). Most email marketing tools, such as Mailchimp, Drip, Aweber, and Campaign Monitor, allow you to add preview text to your emails during email creation.\n\nSome platforms may automatically generate preview text based on the email’s content if you don’t provide custom information. Review the automatically generated text to ensure it aligns with your messaging and goals.\n\nNo time to fine-tune your email copy? Hire an email copywriting specialist on Mayple. We'll match you with the perfect one within days!\n\nThe ideal length for preview text\n\nHow long should the email preview text be?\n\nThe perfect email preview text length depends on the email client (Google, Outlook, etc.) Each of them has unique character limits:\n\nApple Mail: 140, 87 (iPad), 81–137 (iPhone)\n\nGmail: 97 (web), 90 (iOS), no specific number (Android)\n\nOutlook: 55 (Mac), 35 (Windows), no particular number (web)\n\nYahoo Mail: 45–50 (mobile app), no specific number (web)\n\nTo ensure maximum visibility across various clients and devices, aim for 40–90 characters for the preview text and about 60 characters for the subject line.\n\nHow to deal with different email clients’ character limits?\n\nHandling varying character limits in email clients can be challenging. You can partner with an email copywriting freelancer to help with preview text creation or do it independently. Here are four practical approaches to ensure your preview text displays well across all platforms:\n\nBite-sized chunks: Write short sections of preview text separated by symbols like “|” or “–.” This move prevents email clients from cutting off long texts awkwardly and boosts the visibility of important information.\n\nFlow into the opening: Create a smooth transition from your preview text to the email’s opening lines. To achieve this, remove any preheader text (e.g., “View in browser”) and use punctuation marks to signal the end of the preview text and the beginning of the email.\n\nRepeat critical points: Highlight essential information by repeating it within the preview text, filling the space, and accommodating various character lengths.\n\nInsert blank space: Use space strategically to create a clean look and draw attention to your email. Ensure there’s enough space to avoid random gaps between the preview text and the email greeting.\n\nStay on the lower end of the character limit: Write preview text within the lowest character limit (around 45 characters). Incorporate additional information if necessary to make it engaging and informative.\n\nHow to optimize your preview text\n\nPreview texts come with quite a hefty limitation, but crafting good ones doesn't have to feel like an impossible mission. Here are some best practices to help you make the most of your preview text:\n\nComplement your subject line\n\nYour preview text should be consistent with the subject line to prevent confusion. If the subject line mentions a limited-time offer, the preview text should highlight its key details and/or create urgency. Consistency between the subject line and preview text creates a comprehensive image, making the message more thoughtful.\n\nProvide a clear message\n\nTo cut through the noise on your potential-customer's inbox, you should\n\nProvide front-load information: Place important details at the beginning to ensure they’re visible across email clients.\n\nAvoid clickbait: Craft a genuine preview that accurately reflects the email content, building trust with recipients.\n\nOpt for short sentences: Use concise, punchy phrases to deliver a clear message within character limits.\n\nNeed some more inspiration? Check out our guide to the best email marketing examples.\n\nAvoid repeating information\n\nDon't settle for rewriting your subject line in your preview text. Use it to bridge the subject and the content of the email. If your subject line announces a sale, use the preview text to highlight a specific deal (e.g., “30% off selected items”) or hint at a promo code. The main idea is to encourage recipients to open the email and discover more.\n\nAlways A/B test\n\nThe best email marketing is the result of continuous fine-tuning – and A/B testing is a huge component in that. Just like your subject line, email header, and even CTA button, your preview text can be A/B tested as well. Here are some tips to help you use A/B tests effectively:\n\nAlways test one element only (e.g., your preview text OR your subject line, not both in the same experiment)\n\nCreate two or more distinct options, each with unique messaging or keywords\n\nSplit your audience into equal segments and assign each a preview text variant\n\nKeep track of open rates, click-throughs, and other metrics to identify the top-performing version\n\nApply the winning preview text to refine your approach and improve your email marketing\n\nKeep preview texts shorter\n\nShorter previews can enhance engagement and readability, especially on mobile devices. Here’s how to keep your preview texts concise:\n\nLimit character count to 40-50 to ensure clear message across devices\n\nPick powerful yet brief phrases to convey your intent effectively\n\nFocus on the most enticing aspect of your email content\n\nUse punctuation and emojis sparingly; they clutter up valuable space\n\nInclude key terms at the beginning\n\nPositioning essential keywords at the beginning of your preview text leads to better engagement. To do this, stress the main value proposition early on. For example, you can use “Free shipping” or “Exclusive tips” to emphasize the value of what you're offering. Also, use action verbs to prompt engagement, such as “Discover,” “Learn,” or “Save.”\n\nJust make sure these words don’t look too intrusive – there's a fine line between being salesy and smooth copywriting that attracts and engages audiences.\n\nAdd an incentive\n\nWho doesn’t like perks? We seek good bargains and are more likely to consider such offers. So incorporating incentives in your preview text can do the job. Identify a compelling offer, such as a “Bonus gift” or “Early access.”\n\nCommunicate the incentive’s value to your audience with phrases like “Save 20%” or “Unlock expert advice.” Remember not to overpromise or exaggerate the bonus, as it’s essential to maintain credibility.\n\nCreate urgency\n\nMaximize your preview text effectively by instilling urgency:\n\nUse time-limited phrases, like “Offer ends today” or “Last chance to join”\n\nAdd examples, such as “3 hours left” or “Only five items remaining”\n\nMatch urgent statements with your subject line and message\n\nDraw attention\n\nHow else can you make the preview text stand out? Trigger emotions and draw attention with the help of the following:\n\nsymbols like “★” in social proof emails\n\nemojis, such as 🔥, 🚀 to incite curiosity\n\nexclamation marks to show excitement\n\nIntriguing questions, like \"Ready for a game-changer?\"\n\nInclude a CTA\n\nEntice readers with an irresistible CTA in your preview text. It can be something like “Grab your free ebook” or “Reserve limited seats.” Add more benefits with phrases like “Boost productivity by 50%” or “Experience exclusive content.”\n\nYour CTAs can be even more specific, like “Join our masterclass today” or “Claim your discount before it expires.”\n\nRemember: the CTA should always be genuine and achievable, as trust plays a crucial role in email engagement.\n\nPersonalize the text\n\nEveryone appreciates a personal touch. You should also leverage the opportunity to connect with readers by personalizing preview text. Add customized elements, use recipients’ names, or mention their interests to create an instant connection.\n\nFor example, try \"[Name], boost your photography skills today!” or “Unlock expert tips for avid travelers.” Keep the tone conversational and genuine, avoiding robotic language. Personalizing your preview text will foster a sense of familiarity, encouraging readers to engage with your content.\n\n3 preview text examples to inspire you\n\nNow that we have gone through some best practices, let’s delve into some best email preview text examples.\n\nUnderlining the benefits: Calvin Klein\n\nAdding more information: Justin Welsh\n\nCreating urgency: SHEIN\n\nThe payoff of investing time into writing killer preview texts\n\nYour preview text is a critical element of your email marketing campaign.
