        "text": "I have been trying to establish a new Apple Account (ID) for my mother-in-law with no luck. If I try creating a new account via iTunes - iTunes just locks up. If I try via the web (Firefox fails, been using Edge) at appleid.apple.com all I get is \"Your request could not be completed at this time,\" Your account cannot be created at this time.\" So when or how can I create an account.\n\nJeff\n\nI will say avoid using the https://appleid.apple.com/ website for creating an Apple ID I don't know its not working for me. Instead, try using the iCloud website at https://www.icloud.com/ and create a new Apple ID there I have success with this method. Give it a try, and hopefully, it resolves the issue for you!\n\nSame problem here for more than a week now. I've tried to establish a new Apple ID for a new iPhone on:\n\nthe iPhone itself\n\non my Mac Mini\n\non a web browser (appleid.apple.com), also with Safari and Chrome, with the same result.\n\nEvery time I get the same error message as above (\"Your account cannot be created at this time...\"). Any ideas?\n\nMost of the \"solutions\" in that article are not solutions, they are workarounds. They are not addressing the actual issue causing the message. I suspect that unless Apple's servers are down (and I provided a way to check that) then the main reason for the message is somebody has omitted some information, or is doing some other invalid activity such as trying to enter an address in a different country.\n\nYes, there could be various other reasons, such as using a VPN, which changes your IP travelers will relate to this which also interfere with the network. Apple is smart in detecting such activity, but actually, most of the non techies are not able to make an account because of small issues like entering a password with their first name or also omitted information, as you said, which are also some of the reasons they can’t make an account. Furthermore, mostly the people who bought old Apple devices also encounter this issue as the previous owner didn’t spare a single slot for ID creation, as Apple allows only 3 accounts per year. And I think the guide has all sorts of advice and workarounds which I think will help those who have issues in creating an account, as I had, and got mine created using the iCloud one.\n\nCheck if Apple's servers are working: Apple - Support - System Status\n\nCheck what you are doing is valid and has all the information required. Sometimes an \"at this time\" message doesn't really mean something isn't working now but might be later; it instead can mean there is some other issue with the validity of the action (e.g., missing information) you are trying to perform and once you take care of that issue then it can do it. Check Apple's documentation about the action you are trying to do and if you still have problems contact official Apple Support:\n\nClick here --> Choose your country or region - Official Apple Support Select your country, then a product. If you don't see one that handles your issue then keep experimenting with selections until you reach one that gets you a chat session or a telephone call and get the representative to redirect you.\n\nor:\n\nContact Apple for support and service --> \"See a list of Apple phone numbers around the world.\"\n\nClick here --> Contact Apple for support and service - Apple Support\n\nchrism_31 - I think you are experiencing what I did. Try my explanation in this thread about creating an entire new user profile on your Mac and use the new Apple ID you are attempting to create/verify for this new user profile. My experience was that it forced all the terms to come up and then be accepted, which seems to be blocking the progress on this issue."
