        "text": "After some learning, because I'm not an expert, so it takes time to test it out on my systems too.\n\nThere are some issues that need to be addressed in the first post.\n\n-> Curve Optimizer can only be set between +30 to 0 and to a minimum negative of -30, official slide from AMD.\n\nYou can input -39 but won't do anything, at least didn't do anything in a 5800X3D and 7950X. Scores can have variations to a higher value but not in a meaningful way to indicate the value entered.\n\n-> DON'T EVER max out the Load Line Calibration!! After some tinkering with medium values, my load voltages were just strange, looked like it was totally ignoring my negative offset, you want this in the low to mid depending on what you want. This has been discussed by Buildzoid and GamersNexus.\n\nReally, very careful, and use HWiNFO to monitor your vCore. Don't look at VID, that is what the CPU requests not what the CPU is fed. If you use the extreme values of LLC you might end with over 1.55v without CO, and sure, you get nice performance but in very to mid short amount of time you'll also have a dead CPU.\n\nYou don't \"normally\" need that super massive vCore voltages, even though it adds stability but also adds more silicon degradation.\n\nFrom TOMSHARDWARE:\n\nExample, without any heavy manual overriding, the 7950X can achieve 5.85Ghz of which I can get 5.75Ghz with just 1,38-1,4v on the vCore.\n\nSome examples and explanation about LLC variations in GN with a collab from Buildzoid.\n\nSo, how do I know if I have headroom to spare for a better PBO?\n\nTemperature is the major one, the lower the better. I already knew that from my old 2700X, that is why I could squeeze a massive amount of PPT, way above 170Watt which is for a 105TDP CPU way above the 142 spec.\n\nI had also an override of +200 to put the 2700X at 4.5Ghz with less than 1,4v vCore and a cinebench of +10k\n\nAgain, keep in mind this was a Zen+ part with just shy of 9000 points of a 7800X3D\n\nVRM is the another thing that gets overlooked by builders, I see too much bad pairings of CPU and Board.\n\nEveryone just assumes the X chipset board is plain better at everything than a B chipset board, sometimes, its not true.\n\nTLDR: Don't put a massive 170TDP CPU on a X670 Prime with a weaker VRM configuration of a B650 RoG Strix E\n\nor... Don't put a 7700X on an expensive RoG X670 Strix E\n\nWhat are my conclusions then:\n\nI love tinkering a lot, always changing to see what I can get.\n\nStock Cinebench Scores for a 7950X is according to the program itself, Roughly 37K\n\nAs soon as I activated EcoMode 105 my CB dropped to 33K, it was expectable.\n\nStarted with the usual Offset undervolt which lowered temps, thus increasing a bit but not much.\n\nWent after Curve Optimizer, Scalar and added again more negative offset. My scores are now back to 37K.\n\n- You would say: \"but that is stock, you did nothing!\"\n\nOh, but I did. I can get 37K with EcoMode 105 and a 240 Rad watercooler, its not a 360. Although, I'm seeing PPT again at 230 in some instances, so its bypassing somehow during boost states the 105 EcoMode.\n\nNext Step is per core Curve Optimizer, next winter I want the 7950X above 40K on cinebench.\n\nJust my 2 Cents\n\nThe Englishman\n\nYou are mixing apples and oranges and throwing in a few bananas for good measure.\n\nWhile it is true that originally the offset was limited to 30, that was changed so that higher (lower?) offsets could be used. The slide you are showing is way out of date.I can't exactly remember which AGESA introduced this change, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was the AGESA 1.0.0.7 which brought a bunch of goodies with it (like being able to manipulate tREFi for instance).\n\nHow do I know this? Simple, as I went from negative 30 to negative 35 with my 7800X3D for instance, my benchmark results increase.\n\nThe 7800X3D is severely limited for voltage and even under the worst case scenario the voltage is around 1.15 Volts. With the 7800X3D vs the 7950X that I have, the main difference is that with the 7800X3D the single core boost frequency equals the max all core frequency, meaning, there is no single core boost.\n\nThus, the overshoots from the that 1.15 Voltage are well within the safety margins of the maximum voltage that can be safely applied to 5nm Ryzen, namely 1.2 Volts, when the LLC is maxed out.\n\nWith regard to the 7950X I have, I was writing a post here on the AMD site, but as it has done so often with extensive posts of mine it stuffed it up and not only did I lose the work, but also the autosave was gone.\n\nSo I now post on Reddit, because at least there the editing software doesn't screw me over.\n\nThe post is about my 7950X after 20 Months of 24/7 usage, and you might find it interesting:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ryzen/comments/1cwb46h/7950x_running_247_for_20_months_no_degradation/\n\nMan, you need to start reading and understanding more, watch LLC by buildzoid again even though its using a Intel system its the same principle, when I get home ill leave a link if you cant find it.\n\nThe \"scary\" one is the most obvious one, CPU LLC that affects vCore. If you don't know this, maybe moving dials is not such a great ideia for you.\n\nIf you listen carefully what buildzoid says, its not gonna happen overnight, It causes silicon degradation, could take quite a while, or not. Again, silicon lottery.\n\nLike I said before you need to improve your speech and assume less.\n\nI did not bought my 7950X. It was an amazing gift, that to this very day, makes me be humble and say Thank YOU to this RED TEAM COMMUNITY.\n\nSo, since you don't know nothing about my system, I decided to keep my 2 year old Ryujin and test out EcoMode 105 instead of wasting money on more parts.\n\nIt also lets me improve my tinkering skills and learn more.\n\nLastly. Tone your words, I already gave you a fair warning before. If you keep using this kind of speech I won't be keeping mine. Keep it fair here.\n\nThe Englishman\n\nThanks mate, i may actually hit you up, as you seem to get it, if thats cool? I do have a few questions. Also in the new agesa 1516 bios, they actually changed (asus x670e-e) some of the wording. In bios 1516 i no longer see vddsoc llc,.(pics above), . probably because some people got \"things confused\". Hang on and ill grab a pic. vddsoc llc is no longer titled that, from what i see.\n\nAnd to Johnnyenglish ( i get free **bleep**). Look, if your scared of words, .... well, thats on you. Im not. At all.\n\n\"Lastly. Tone your words, I already gave you a fair warning before. If you keep using this kind of speech I won't be keeping mine. Keep it fair here.\"\n\nI did keep it \"fair\"..... and if you wanna go off, act like a cun t or whatever, go for it. Have at it, ... as i promise, i wont get affected at all,.. that said, your 47 page reply, that i didnt read (because ive already seen the vid you posted, regarding the wrong chip, wrong system, half a decade old, wrong) and, welp, it seems you do you, and ill do me. Because, im going to do me.\n\n(silicone degradation, yerp, instead of lasting 47 years, it gets knocked down to 46 and a half, in which, Im fairly confident, im using another cpu, even when I actually pay for all mine vs you)\n\nAlso, hang for bios change pic.... ill restart meow.\n\nWell, **bleep** them to. I brought the SOC voltage issue up, before it even became a thing. You can look at a GamersNexus video about it, ...... because, that seems to suite you. I brought it up there, and,...... well, i guess it was \"degrading\" and talking bad on the very product i owned and ran. I also brought up how stupid their wording on the new bios was. \"run this your ok, but if you do, you void the warrantee\". Got dinged for that. Then, guess what, some videos where made about it, everyone lost their **bleep**, and then, it got removed. Weird, i actually had a issue with something that wasn't right, the \"community\" that you so love, got the correct action. The proper action, on gear, i myself owned. OH AND PAID FOR.\n\nI was dumped on, because i was giving the maker, of that site ,..**bleep**....static, calling out bs. So, before you chuck that stone,.... maybe take a look else where, like, do the mirror thing. Cool, .. got a IQ of a doughnut. Again,.for me, words, don't do **bleep** boss. Cheers. Lets just block each other. That way, i dont have to hear you, and you dont see me."
