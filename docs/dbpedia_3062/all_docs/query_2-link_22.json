This can occur when a party refuses to produce documents, fails to answer interrogatories, or refuses to provide testimony.

The judge then makes a ruling on the motion to compel, which can include ordering the opposing party to provide the requested information or documents, imposing sanctions, or denying the motion.\n\nWhat happens if a motion to compel is ignored?\n\nIf the opposing party ignores a motion to compel, the moving party can file a motion for sanctions.

In extreme cases, the party that is not complying with the discovery request can be held in contempt of court, which can result in jail time or other serious penalties.\n\nTips for lawyers\n\nBe diligent in your discovery requests: Ensure that your discovery requests are specific and tailored to the issues in the case.
