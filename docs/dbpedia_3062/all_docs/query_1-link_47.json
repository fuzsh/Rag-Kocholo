        "text": "Xojo 2021 R 3.1\n\nMac\n\nMojave\n\nI have created controls at Runtime using ControlSets in the past. Now the documentation tells me that I can create a control at runtime. How is this done? I can find the documentation describing how to do it using Control Sets but what is this better way to do it? I have not found the documentation for creating a Control at Runtime without using a ControlSet\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\nControl Sets are no longer needed because you can now create controls at runtime and add them to the layout for all project types. It is suggested that you do that rather than use Control Sets.\n\nI have tried various things with no success. One, just to prove I have tried, was to have a property of a window be oneRect and in the code of the Opening event of the window\n\noneRect = New DesktopRectangle oneRect.Parent = Self oneRect.Left = 500 oneRect.Top = 600 oneRect.Width = 100 oneRect.Height = 80 oneRect.AllowAutoDeactivate = True oneRect.BorderColor = KColor.BLACK oneRect.BorderThickness = 1 oneRect.FillColor = KColor.BLUEBERRY oneRect.CornerSize = 16 oneRect.Transparent = False oneRect.Visible = True\n\nI had hoped that there would be a rectangle on the window when it appeared but nothing. Various others things I tried did not work. So what is the way that you code a Control to appear at runtime?\n\nKColor.BLACK and KColor.BLUEBERRY are just constants that I have in my code.\n\nI credit Adam with the solution because he was first but I appreciate the next two posters as well for additional information. All appreciated.\n\nI do like the references to the blog pages. I would comment that in its current state, this information is hard (? impossible) to find in the regular documentation for Desktop. Where the current documentation comments that ControlSets are not necessary, it would be nice to have it go further and link you to a page or explain the AddControl command for Desktop."
