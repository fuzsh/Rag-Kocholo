        "text": "We prefer to focus on the positive\n\nThe planning fallacy stems from our overall bias towards optimism, especially when our own abilities are concerned.11,12 In general, we are oriented towards positivity. We have optimistic expectations of the world and other people; we are more likely to remember positive events than negative ones; and, most relevantly, we tend to favor positive information in our decision-making processes.1,2\n\nWhen it comes to our own capabilities, we are particularly bad at making accurate judgments. Take one study that asked incoming university students to estimate how they would perform academically compared to their classmates. On average, participants believed they would outperform 84% of their peers.3 Of course, this estimate may have been accurate for some students, but it is mathematically impossible for everybody to be in the top 16%.\n\nAll of this means that when we set out to plan a project, we are likely to focus on imagined successful outcomes rather than potential pitfalls, and we are likely to overestimate how capable we (and our team members) are of meeting certain goals. While enthusiasm is certainly important for any venture, it can become problematic if it comes at the expense of being realistic.\n\nWe become anchored to our original plan\n\nAnchoring is another type of cognitive bias that plays a big role in the planning fallacy. Coined by Muzafer Sherif, Daniel Taub, and Carl Hovland, anchoring is the tendency to rely too heavily on initial information when we are making decisions.6 When we draw up a plan for a project, we are biased to continue thinking about those initial values—deadlines, budgets, and so on.\n\nAnchoring is especially problematic if our original plans were unrealistically optimistic. Even if our initial predictions were massively inaccurate, we still feel tethered to those numbers even as we try to reassess. This leads us to make insufficient adjustments to our plans as we go along, preferring to make minor tweaks rather than major changes (even if major changes are necessary).\n\nWe write off negative information\n\nEven if we do take outside information into account, we have a tendency to discount pessimistic views or data that challenges our optimistic outlook. This is the flip side of our positivity bias: our preference for affirmative information also makes us reluctant to consider the downsides.\n\nIn the business world, one example of this is known as competitor neglect, which describes how company executives fail to anticipate how their rivals will behave because they are focused on their own organization.3 For example, when a company decides to break into a fast-growing market, it often forgets to consider its competitors are likely to do the same, leading to an underestimation of risk.\n\nMore generally, we often make attribution errors when considering our successes and failures. Whereas we tend to ascribe positive outcomes to our talents and hard work, we attribute negative outcomes to factors beyond our control. This makes us less likely to consider previous failures: we believe those instances were not our fault, and we convince ourselves that the external factors that caused us to fail will not reoccur.4\n\nWe face social pressure\n\nOrganizational pressure to finish projects quickly and without problems is a major reason that the planning fallacy can be so detrimental. Workplace cultures can often be highly competitive, and there may be costs for individuals who voice less enthusiastic opinions about a project or who insist on a longer timeline than others. At the same time, executives might favor the most overly optimistic predictions over others, incentivizing individuals to engage in inaccurate, intuition-based planning.\n\nMerely being aware of the planning fallacy is not enough to stop it from happening.5 Even if we have this knowledge, we still risk falling into the trap of believing that this time, the rules won’t apply to us. Most of us strongly prefer to follow our gut, even if its forecasts have been wrong in the past. What we can do is plan around the planning fallacy and build steps into the planning process that can help us avoid it.\n\nTake the outside view\n\nWhen planning, we use two “types” of information: singular information and distributional information. Singular information is evidence related to the specific case under consideration, whereas distributional information is evidence related to similar tasks completed in the past.5 These perspectives are also referred to as the inside and outside views, respectively.3\n\nIdeally, both singular and distributional information should be considered when planning. The planning fallacy is likely to arise when we rely solely on the inside view—that is when we disregard external information about how likely we are to succeed and instead trust our intuitive guesses about how costly a project will be. Unfortunately, this is exactly what many of us tend to do. Because planning is an inherently future-oriented process, we are inclined to look forward, rather than backward, in time. This leads us to disregard our past experiences.4\n\nSupplementing planning processes with distributional (outside) data, wherever possible, is a solid way to temper expectations for a project.3 If an organization or individual has completed similar projects in the past, they can use the outcomes of those previous experiences to set goals for new ones. It is just as useful to look outside one’s own experiences and see how others have fared. The main point is to make a deliberate effort not to rely solely on intuition.\n\nSet implementation intentions\n\nAnother strategy for combating the planning fallacy is illustrated by a study from the Netherlands, where study participants were given a writing assignment and told to complete it within a week. The participants were split into two groups. Both groups were instructed to set goal intentions, indicating what day they intended to start writing the paper and what day they believed they would finish. However, the second group also set implementation instructions, specifying what time of day and in what location they would write. They were asked to visualize themselves following through on their plan.\n\nResearchers found that setting specific implementation intentions resulted in significantly more realistic goal-setting.7 At the same time, doing so did not lessen the participants’ optimism; on the contrary, they were even more confident in their ability to meet their goals. They also reported fewer interruptions while they were working. This may be because the process of thinking through the specifics of completing the task at hand resulted in a stronger commitment to following through with one’s plan. These results show that optimism is not incompatible with realism as long as it is combined with a carefully thought-out plan.\n\nUse the segmentation effect for better estimates\n\nA related strategy involves breaking up big projects into their component parts, and then planning for the completion of the smaller subtasks instead of the project as a whole. As bad as we are at estimating the amount of time required for relatively large tasks, research has shown that we are much better at planning for small ones: often, our estimates are remarkably accurate, and at worst, they are overestimates.9 This is, therefore a much safer strategy: In practice, it’s much better to overestimate the amount of time needed for a project than to allocate too little.\n\nNow one of the most iconic man-made structures in the world, the construction of the Sydney Opera House was mired with delays and unforeseen difficulties that caused the project to drag on for a decade longer than planned. The original projected cost was $7 million; by the time it was done, it had cost $102 million.4\n\nThe Australian Government insisted that construction begin early, wanting to break ground, while public opinion about the Opera House was still favorable and funding was still in place. However, the architect had not yet completed the final plans, leading to major structural issues that had to be addressed down the road, slowing the project down and inflating the budget. One major problem: the original podium was not strong enough to support the House’s famous shell-shaped roof and had to be rebuilt entirely.\n\nJoseph Cahill, the politician who had championed the Opera House, rushed construction along out of fear that political opposition would try to stop it.9 In his enthusiasm, he disregarded criticisms of the project and relied on intuitive forecasts for its costs. While the building, when it was eventually finished, was beautiful and distinctive, it would have been prudent to slow down and take the outside view in planning.\n\nWhat it is\n\nThe planning fallacy describes how we are likely to underestimate the costs of a project, such as how long it will take and how much it will cost.\n\nWhy it happens\n\nThe human brain is generally biased towards positivity, leading us to make overly optimistic predictions about our projects, as well as to disregard information that contradicts our optimistic beliefs. Once we have set unrealistic plans, other biases, such as anchoring, compel us to stick with them. Pressure from team members, superiors, or shareholders to get things done quickly and smoothly also makes it more costly for us to revise our plans partway through a project.\n\nExample #1 – The Sydney Opera House\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is a famous example of the planning fallacy because it took 10 years longer and nearly $100 million more to complete than was originally planned. One major reason was the government’s insistence on starting construction early, despite the fact that plans were not yet finished.\n\nExample #2 – The Canadian Pacific Railway\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was finished four years late and more than $20 million over budget, largely because of a failure to plan for the difficulties of building through mountain ranges and over the Canadian Shield.\n\nHow to avoid it\n\nThe planning fallacy is best avoided by incorporating outside information into the planning process rather than relying solely on intuition. Other strategies, such as setting specific intentions to implement a plan, envisioning oneself carrying out the plan, and segmenting large projects into smaller subtasks, can also help generate more accurate estimates of how costly something will be."
