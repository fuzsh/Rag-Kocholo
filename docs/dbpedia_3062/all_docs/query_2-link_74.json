        "text": "Facts\n\nErnesto Miranda was arrested in Phoenix due to circumstantial evidence that he had been involved in a kidnapping and rape. He confessed to the charges following a lengthy interrogation and signed a statement that said the confession was made knowingly and voluntarily. Miranda never was told of his right to remain silent, of his right to have a lawyer, or of the fact that any of his statements during the interrogation could be used against him in court. He objected to the introduction of the written copy of his confession into evidence at trial, stating that his ignorance of his rights made the confession involuntary.\n\nWhen the objection was overruled, Miranda was convicted of the kidnapping and rape at least in part because of the written confession, and he was sentenced to 20-30 years in prison. An appeal based on the confession's allegedly involuntary nature was rejected by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nAttorneys\n\nAlvin Moore (defendant)\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nEarl Warren (Author)\n\nHugo Lafayette Black\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr.\n\nAbe Fortas\n\nWarren felt that a police interrogation is such an intimidating situation for most suspects that it triggered the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to an attorney unless the suspect waived those rights. The opinion also emphasized the need for law enforcement to strictly comply with those rights if a suspect exercises them. Since this decision followed Gideon v. Wainwright, which held that there was an absolute right to counsel for indigent criminal defendants, the right to an attorney included the appointment of a public defender if the suspect was indigent. Exercising the right to an attorney also expanded that Sixth Amendment protection to having an attorney during questioning after arrest and before trial, not a situation that Gideon contemplated. As part of the foundation for his reasoning, Warren used FBI practices and rules governing interrogations of military service members suspected of crimes.\n\nConcurrence/Dissent In Part\n\nTom C. Clark (Author)\n\nClark was uneasy about what appeared to be a sweeping rule that the majority had created. He advocated using a totality of the circumstances standard from the decision in Haynes v. Washington. This would permit a court to make a case-by-case evaluation while placing the burden on the state to show that the Miranda rights were waived or that the confession was voluntary under the specific circumstances.\n\nDissent\n\nJohn Marshall Harlan II (Author)\n\nHarlan felt that the majority opinion was an example of impermissible judicial activism, since it lacked support in the text of the Constitution or other law. He argued that creating entire doctrines through inference reduced the legitimacy of constitutional law overall.\n\nDissent\n\nByron Raymond White (Author)\n\nEchoing Harlan, White noted that the majority not only had no textual foundation in the Constitution for its opinion but also lacked any Court precedents. He even researched English common law to confirm that it contained no support for Warren. White ominously observed that the majority's rule, if diligently applied, could lead to serious criminals escaping justice.\n\nCase Commentary"
