He is also chairman of the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, a partnership of eight Dutch multinationals committed to sustainable growth.

“In a number of sectors major transitions are taking place, like climate change, energy, circular economy and implementations of the SDG’s. At Hague, I want to commit myself mainly at European level with companies and organizations to reflect on the implications of those transitions and to provide advice on strategical choices to make. Those choices can touch upon own core activities but also on relevant partnerships.”
