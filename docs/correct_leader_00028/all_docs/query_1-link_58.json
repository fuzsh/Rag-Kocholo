        "text": "Have a purpose. Our mission is to be 'a force for positive change' in the world\n\nby Professor Steef van de Velde, Dean Rotterdam School of Management\n\nIn the opening address the Dean, after the first round of workshops, welcomed the corporate foundation managers on Monday 3 December. He described how the design and implementation of the current mission statement of RSM fit the theme of the conference about the societal impact of corporate foundations. This year RSM celebrates its 50th anniversary and the department of Business-Society Management its 20th. 20 years ago studying social aspects of business was not very common. Business school were seen rather as a cause of all evil by social organisations, than a partner to collaborate with. Luckily we have always had great researchers addressing the pain points and continued to the role of businesses in our society at large. Prof. Van de Velde continued with some examples. “About 10 years ago, we started the I WILL initiative. It was and maybe still is much to ask an 18 year old to think about and quote their purpose in life, but we have made great progress with this goalsetting intervention. We now have more than 20000 IWILL statements and many of them articulate what they want to contribute to society.”\n\nFor society at large RSM was also seeking for a common purpose, we have redesigned our strategy and the execution of it several times in these 50 years. About 10 years ago nobody knew our mission statement. All business schools have the same mission, so we thought more about the consultation, the narrative and how to walk the talk. We started to work on the effects of our educational programmes and research aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This is where we now can say RSM has a purpose. Being committed to the SDG’s and their relevance for the business world, gives RSM efficient, effective and powerful aims, said Van de Velde.\n\nIntroduction to the upcoming academic handbook 'Corporate Foundations: Corporate and Civil Society Perspectives'\n\nby Dr. Lonneke Roza\n\nDuring the mini-conference, Dr. Lonneke Roza presents the first ever academic handbook on corporate foundations, a theoretical framework on a field of study which has largely been ignored academics so far. The topics of today’s event are conducted by the forthcoming academic handbook; Corporate foundations: Corporate and Civil Society Perspectives, which will be published in April 2019. Roza says these topics relate to the role of corporate foundations in resolving grand challenges and become a learning organisation; alignment with their related company, but also how they are governed. Moreover, we have first insights into stakeholder involvement such as employees and how non-profit partners make sense of their collaborations with corporate foundations. We also touch upon a very contemporary issue of many organisations, including corporate foundations: how to measure the impact on beneficiaries and society.\n\nResearching corporate foundations globally is unique and has taken some pioneering. Setting a theoretical framework is one, but in our journey we always look at practice and hope to have succeeded today in giving a very first and valuable translation for practitioners to work with. Lonneke says: We understand that you will probably not read our 500-page book, but therefore we develop workshops, trainings, brochures and alike to still give you access to all what we have learned in this journey. We partner with companies, corporate foundations, platforms and other universities to make sure these ‘tools’ are available for those working in the field. We are also collaborating in new projects such as the Erasmus Dynamics of Inclusive Prosperity, to make sure we stay aligned with all stakeholders, Lonneke Roza concluded her keynote.\n\nProf Jan Peter Balkenende - How to move forward\n\nIf you want to move forward you need to learn from history, said Professor Jan Peter Balkenende, former prime minister of the kingdom of the Netherlands and Professor of Governance, Institutions and Internationalisation at Erasmus University Rotterdam.\n\nAfter his prime ministership Prof. Balkenende was asked to become partner for social responsibility at EY. Currently having multiple positions in CSR programmes for business and government and board positions in foundations, Prof. Balkenende complimented Erasmus University with the alignment to social economic and business development.\n\nTo be able to relate to the latest relevant economic academic insights he advised everyone in the room to read some books. Here’s his list to put on your must reads for the holiday break:\n\nThis time is different, eight centuries of financial folly, Carmen M. Reinhart\n\nWhy nations fail, the origins of power, prosperity and poverty, Daron Acemoglu\n\nDougnut economics, seven ways to think like a 21st century economist, Kate Raworth\n\nThe entrepreneurial state, debunking public vs. private sector myths, Mariana Mazzucato\n\nThe value of everything, making and taking in the global economy, Mariana Mazzucato\n\nEconomics for the common good, Jean Tirole\n\nProf. Balkenende continued to talk about the current business landscape and future perspectives. It is all about the quality of society, he said. You need to have a long term perspective, learn from history, endorse change and keep a view on the future. Corporate foundations are in the excellent position to have this long term perspective, learn from what happens in society and adapt to change whilst being honest of the results that they achieve.\n\nProf Georg von Schnurbein - Corporate foundations; global trends and regional differences\n\nProf. Georg von Schnurbein, Professor on foundation management at the Faculty of Business and Economics and founding director of the Center for Philanthropy Studies (CEPS) at the University of Basel gave the audience a summary of the most recent research results on corporate foundations. “These results are used for the academic handbook, but I have summarised the global trends for you”, he said.\n\nHe explains that so far the positioning of the corporate foundation is neglected as we tend to look from two different approaches in literature; societal and managerial perspectives. It is here, that we developed a frame that actually positions the corporate foundations themselves. Looking at regional differences we can conclude that the function and perception of a corporate foundation vary locally, but the corporate foundations as such have become global phenomenon while rapidly growing in numbers all over the world."
