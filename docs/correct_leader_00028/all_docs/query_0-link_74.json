        "text": "Netherlands, The Hague, 12 October 2009 – At today’s meeting with Andrus Ansip, head of the Estonian government, Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende confirmed that the Netherlands supports Estonia’s aspirations towards joining the Eurozone, provided that Estonia meets all the required criteria for joining.\n\n“Estonia wants to join the Eurozone by fulfilling all the necessary criteria because it is our wish to join a strong Eurozone,” said Prime Minister Ansip. The Prime Minister explained to his Dutch colleague that, in all likelihood, Estonia will meet the Maastricht inflation criterion by November of the current year. The loan burden of Estonia’s government sector is already the lowest in the European Union. The biggest challenge at the moment lies in fulfilling the budget deficit requirement. “The budget for the coming year has been drafted with the Maastricht inflation criterion requirements in mind,” the Prime Minister added.\n\nThe Netherlands estimates its budget deficit for 2010 at six per-cent of the country’s gross domestic product. According to data from the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, Dutch GDP will fall by 4.75 per-cent this year, while all efforts are being made to halt the fall in the coming year. The Dutch level of unemployment, which has so far been amongst the lowest in Europe, will most likely rise to around 8 to 9 per-cent by year’s end. In terms of GDP the Dutch economy ranks 16th on a global scale, while in terms of exports the country ranks third in Europe, behind Germany and France.\n\nBesides mutual relations and the economy, the prime ministers also talked about the Lisbon Treaty. Estonia and the Netherlands share similar views regarding the Lisbon process and the EU Budget Process. “The Lisbon Treaty will make the EU stronger, which is why Estonia ratified the Treaty in 2008,” said Prime Minister Ansip.\n\nThe mutual relations between Estonia and the Netherlands are outstanding. In terms of the volume of direct investments, the Netherlands ranks third in the general ranking of the countries that have invested in Estonia. According to data from the Bank of Estonia, direct investments by Dutch companies in Estonia, as at the end of 2008, accounted for BEEK 12.4, which is 6.8 per cent of the total amount of the direct investments made in Estonia.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, who has held office since 2002, visited Estonia in April 2004. President Toomas Hendrik Ilves visited the Netherlands in 2007, and the state visit by Dutch Queen Beatrix to Estonia took place in May of last year.\n\nThe Prime Minister is being accompanied on his visit to the Netherlands by media adviser Liina Lepik (mob +372 53 00 4674, [email protected])."
