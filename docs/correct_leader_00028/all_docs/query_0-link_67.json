        "text": "What appeared to be a modest 'contest' among students (29 November'23), in six months truly shaped in presenting several futuristic and impact-driven practical 'solutions'. Thanks to Wageningen University & Research and WUR Student Challenges: for mentoring, mobilizing data|research and blending niche knowledge to visualize possible applications on-the-ground, in a delta like #Bangladesh that has to deal with complexities, growing #climate uncertainties or difficult choices. [Thanks Marta Eggers for inviting me to share my perspectives: Pages 18-19.] The (44-page) e-book üëâüèºhttps://lnkd.in/eU7kJNav introduces the winning teams and their propositions. Truly worth going over for any interested in FUTURE of #agriculture #nature #water, in other words, üáßüá© ECONOMY and ECOLOGY, overall. Yes, some of these should, and do, merit attention of innovative entrepreneurs or business, as green-fields. My own understanding is: the winning teams and their propositions challenge all in policy space to re-look at many 'given(s)', assumptions and modalities (the ways we conventionally concieve projects/interventions). Also, how do we approach 'profit' (on return to investment that are profoundly 'social'). On a long shot, a number of the winning propositions may also fit for ground-testing in wider global South, given comparable social-cultural-natural milieu.

The Network (BKN) is open to any üáßüá©knowledge worker in #netherlands and also in other parts of #Europe e.g. #germany (in fact, three from German Universities joined yesterday); and aims to foster mutually rewarding environment drawing his/her expertise-experience. Bangladeshi knowledge workers have potential to significantly contribute to the Netherlands thanks to their expertise, entrepreneurial ventures and diverse culture. Dr Bishawjit Mallick laid out the raison d'etre of 'why' should 6,000+ üáßüá©academics-researchers-experts spread across #universities (or research entities) in Europe connect. All concurred, the shared interests or benefits are multiple and mutual. The BKN members pledged to leverage their knowledge, experience and network to support development initiatives, mentor aspiring professionals, and contribute to growth of relevant sectors back home. All recognized BKN much timely, to end \"isolation... recognise individuals, at the least\". Of many ideas that surfaced in the 3-hr interaction, to start with, it was concluded that: - this Network and Friends of Bangladesh in the Netherlands can complement each other in respective works; - progressively, 'thematic groups' wld be organised; - BKN would covene every four months to share and progressively collaboration potential; - Embassy wld welcome ideas for hosting thematic meets, as proposed by BKN; - a portal (at the Embassy web or else) will bring together all the PhD/Matsers Theses done by üáßüá© scholars in the Dutch universities (attn. dear Titia Bred√©e); - a comprehensive database of Bangladeshi experts will be created (to be hosted in a web). A LinkedIn group has just been launched as well https://lnkd.in/dV7-_sGn; - aside the wider platform, thematic groups will also be created gradually for focussed engagements; - in 2025, BKN will convene a day-long Bangladesh knowledge event (introspecting into future research issues in Bangladesh) at a Dutch university (with support from Embassy); If you are a üáßüá© 'knowledge worker' interested, please feel free to sign upüëâüèºhttps://lnkd.in/dSDEfjhf If you have further exciting (concrete), pl post it in BKN LinkedIn Page! For sure, as modest as it may appear, BKN promises to strategically 'leverage' much, to spur action both ways (in Bangladesh as well as Nederland). Not to be yet another talk-shop! Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken Nuffic Leiden University University of Amsterdam Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU Amsterdam) Utrecht University University of Twente Wageningen University & Research Delft University of Technology Eindhoven University of Technology NWO (Dutch Research Council) TNO Erasmus University Rotterdam University of Groningen Maastricht University Tilburg University\n\nProf Joyeeta Gupta asked to share realities/perspectives frm #bangladesh at University of Amsterdam seminar. Listening to the distinguished Panelists, I reckoned, I should rather unpack the difficult choices/dilemmas/trade offs facing a responsible-responsive country in Global South which is keen to move away from Carbon-heavy #energy generation scene: With 26,700+ MW installed capacity, 85% üáßüá© popn. now access electricity. This marks a 434% increase compared to 2000. Our energy mix has 84% fossil fuel [coal 7%, oil 22%, natural gas 55%]. Yes, #renewableenergy e.g. solar, wind have steadily progressed but still has modest share. With 2,400 MW #nuclearpower added (by 2025), that balance will improve. Yet, global discourse need to address certain key issues for a net energy-importing, low-income country as Bangladesh: - when üáßüá©Prime Minister boldly decides to cancel as many as 10 approved Coal-fired Plants (of 10,000 MW) as her commitment to Glasgow COP, how does world offset Bangladesh to fill the vacuum? - as #climateaction, back in 2015, üáßüá©PM emphatically told in NY, \"... we want life-saving technologies, not life-enriching ones\". Yet, UNFCCC proecss offers so little for climate-vulnerable countries as Bangladesh. She declared üáßüá©ambition to be NETZERO by 2070. - for reasons, we shy away from harnessing #coal, even our own coal deposits. As her own natural gas reserves look set to exhaust in a decade's time and we might rapidly turn (imported) LNG dependent, how macroeconomy wld confront the inevitability? Can mutilateral frameworks support us clean energy transition e.g. investing in #hydrogen fuel? Global South can't be left in the lurch. We need to get energy security for small-holders - MSMEs just as crucial as food security. Little do we account that, post Ukraine War, economies of 30+ Middle Income Countries slided dangerously failing to cope up with high energy cost (and had to lean on fossil fuel). Yes, Bangladesh avows to step up to the global aspirations in spite of being at the far end of 'alternatives' (to fossil fuel). But, ClimateAction must robustly talk of farming (e.g. small-holders) as well as sustainable-affordable energy for the bottom rung. While we see global finance positioning to #NetZero (de-carbonizing Carbon-heavy industries like Power, Cement, Steel, Transport), what future beckons Bangladesh in the new times? Will global (multilateral & commercial) finance minimise risks in the new investments? Global South, especially climate-vulnerable ones, cry for investments. Amibiguities in (bilateral) investment regimes as well as FDI frameworks must not lead to 'sunset (energy-guzzling) industries litter the South simply creating employment for some thousands. Global market distortions must be addressed, in \"shared interests\".

It wasn‚Äôt yet another dialogue to delve into (past) accomplishments. Rather to prospect into likely scenarios, possible solutions-choices‚Äìpathways. Or, how to deal with unknowns or, unknowables? How to tackle risks or uncertainties? How to test impactful solutions on-the-ground, even in research? The RT built on an earlier edition (Jan. '22) with WUR that candidly brought up intricacies, inter-linkages, future scenarios, trade-offs and probable options facing future agriculture in Bangladesh. Much started as Prof Louise Fresco aptly told Agri Minister (Nov. 2021) that it‚Äôs time to transform Bangladesh #agriculture! Her successor, Prof Sjoukje Heimovaara, underlined the same (July 2022) as üáßüá©Minister handed her a Non-Paper on transformation of üáßüá©agriculture. Four inter-connected streams in the RT addressed the endemic issues that should make farming future-proof, especially for vast majority of small-holders. üáßüá©Agri Minister said, ‚ÄúI am a farmer turned politician. For 7 decades in my life, I saw how millions of our small/marginal farmers battle out challenges in our delta...To them, farming is just not a livelihood, but also their identity, their heritage. End-game shld be to strike long-run balance betn profit (private sector), wealth (nature ) and prosperity (small-holders).‚Äù While Bangladesh meets food and nutrition security for her 170 mln people, growing population, shifting demand and stress on natural resources make future(s) pretty complex e.g. each yr., nearly 30% harvest gets lost due to post-harvest issues. As much as increasing production, it‚Äôs equally critical to get ‚Äòverticals‚Äô right i.e. having affordable/manageable storage facilities/technologies; ensuring safe food production and food safety and mechanizing in ways that benefit small-holders. Many questions stay unanswered as well: Minimizing risks across agriculture? Engaging companies‚Äìentrepreneurs‚Äìinnovators? Getting Public-Private Partnerships work? Attracting #youth in farming, esp. as agriculture rapidly digitizes? Drawing global AgriTech to engage in Bangladesh Agri/agro-food scene? Introducing niche solutions to optimize resource utilization? At the end, WUR-SASK-BARC pledged on a tripartite ARRANGEMENT to work in Bangladesh. üáßüá©Govt noded to WUR to pilot those 3 Projects. All in a shared enterprise, driven by mutuality of interests. To any business, let challenges in Bangladesh be potential opportunities: yes, Bangladesh can be seen in light of gaps, yet let‚Äôs not miss out a land with fertile soil, abundant freshwater, diverse agro-ecology, rich bio-diversity and millions of small farmers bringing centuries‚Äô farming heritage.

Listening to academics | planners at Utrecht University, especially to Prof Ajay Bailey Seama Mowri Sanghamitra Roy Bishawjit Mallick, and imagining Metros-Cities-Towns in üáßüá©#delta, flagged that academics & planners alike need to approach urbanization as an evolving process, much beyond 'spatial planning'. Solutions to urban challenges better be approached from social/cultural lens. Simply bcoz people live and work - in co-shared space - in a city|town with so much different attitude or preferences. Also, how to balance trade-offs in solving an urban issue e.g. valuing open space in densely-packed cities like Dhaka where ponds/tanks have been traded off to meet growing public needs (like playground). So, how wld one balance 'private gain' vis-a-vis 'public interest'? As land-scarce as a city be, we can't downplay value of open fields (e.g. sports, parks) or cultural arena. Temperature spectrum in our cities is a major worry. As we battle growing heat stress or rising mean temperature (round-the-year) and ponder over concretisation, cld we try indigenous, high Carbon-absorptive species the way Barcelona or Madrid does? Or neem plantation in Delhi? Or similar in Tokyo? ...Also, does current Building Code help in making our bldgs future-proof? Do we need to blend new materials/techniques with #designthinking? Can we not fancy for westernised #architecture than climate/culture sensitive designs?! Before we worry over #waste disposal, why not contain/mininise social/cultural traits shaping individuals' behavior that lead to (excessive) generation of waste? Bangladesh cities are increasingly water stressed. Also in provisioning sanitation services. Yet, little do we inquire: how much do we 'value' #water, from individual consumption point of view? Currently, 40%+ üáßüá© popn live in urban space. Little do we realise that, by 2030, that number is to rise to 48%! As cities evolve, beyond numbers, we ought to think of the elderly and #women as much #youth, not just on mobility considerations. End of the day, a city is so much beyond an organized place to live - to think, to aspire, to create. To me, 'polders' in #netherlands is essentially a 'culture' (of drawing and engaging people and building convergence), much less a water infrastructure. Isn't it time to apply 'polder approach' in shaping and spearheading sustainable | inclusive urbanisation beyond rhetorics? Let's dare to experiment, take risks in testing solutions and visualize social-economic urban (as also rural) scenarios, together.

During my four yrs in #SriLanka (2016-20), knowing Dr ATR had been one of the most prized experience. On few occasions, was truly privileged to sit with him at his home, listen to his priceless journey-in-life and reflections. .. He is mostly regarded as the founder of #Sarvodaya movement <https://www.sarvodaya.org/>. Yet, all the five decades, he was equally concerned over and connected to his peers across #southasia, including in #Bangladesh, constantly pondering 'what' cld be done for the masses, beyond his own land! A few weeks before my departure from Colombo (in the middle of Covid restrictions), I insisted with him to have a meal with us (our family) at Bangladesh House knowing full well that he rarely responds to such social (i.e. diplomatic) invites. I and my wife did so simply to pay tribute to a 'living giant' that he was. That (May 2020) evening, as he stepped in, I soon discovered that my son, Taiyeb, got glued to him; and even started taking notes of all wisdom Dr AT (as many wld fondly address him) was pouring. He presented Taiyeb a most precious gift - the set of his (5 piece) autobiography! It is just difficult to narrate the energy that a diminutive Dr AT would exude defying his age, in vision or conviction. Individuals of the kind of Dr AT are just too rare, today. To me, he represented a generation of South Asians who celebrated 'selflessness' and championed 'empathy', 'harmony', 'tolerance'. Distinctly recall how he mobilized society (apolitically) against 'ultra-nationalist' politics that was stoked by nationalism, ahead of 2018 Presidential election in SL. He was a humanist, unqualified. A sage, in action (serving the 'creation'). A devout believer that he was, he stood for others, without fear. He spoke out his mind even on contemporary politics as what he regarded 'good for Sri Lanka' (even when some felt uncomfortable). I and my family join in earnest prayers, our way, and stand with millions, in silence. Surely the Almighty will hear our call to accept his soul in heavenly abode for all his deeds. And, his legacy surely asks each of us to do our modest bit the way a true South Asian - as Dr AT - walked the world; and challenges us to stand up for (faceless) 'others'. Dr.Vinya Ariyaratne Channa de Silva Srilanka\n\nHow wld one define a priceless Nakshi Katha (embroidered quilt)? As a mere heritage? As a product (if so, how much are we ready to cough up for the imagination | creativity of the unlettered craftsperson(s) behind? While we often stare and rejoice at a 'Katha', we ignore the deeper sides of the piece ...a Katha is something that machine can't create or #artificialintelligence can little generate! A Nakshi Katha, to me, is more of identity of the weavers, something that they embark on to celebrate and unleash themselves. It's about a shared heritage. https://lnkd.in/eska5CqK As we celebrate beginning of a (new) BANGLA YEAR, the Embassy chose to share our joy with friends in #netherlands #europe and beyond presenting this bit of our heritage, something universal as well! ______ Nakshi Katha (geborduurde quilt) is niet alleen een erfgoedproduct van gewone mensen in Bangladesh. Door de eeuwen heen verbeelden #vrouwen hun leven ‚Äì van vreugde, wanhoop of feest. Een handgestikte quilt belichaamt het canvas van het leven voor de perso(o)n(en) erachter. Een Nakshi Katha maakt deel uit van de identiteit van een gezin, niet alleen van de wever(s). Onderdeel van een gedeeld #erfgoed van de #mensen, in #bangladesh. Terwijl we het begin van een (nieuw) BANGLA-JAAR vieren, heeft de ambassade ervoor gekozen om onze vreugde te delen met vrienden in #nederland #europa en daarbuiten door dit stukje van ons erfgoed te presenteren, ook iets universeels!
