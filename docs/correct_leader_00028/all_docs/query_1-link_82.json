        "text": "THE HAGUE -- A new Dutch government has been sworn in which includes members of the Pim Fortuyn List, whose controversial leader was assassinated a week before the elections.\n\nThe new government consists of the Christian Democrats (CDA), the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) and the free-market People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which was also a partner in the outgoing three-way government.\n\nJan Peter Balkenende became the Netherlands' first Christian Democrats prime minister in eight years as Queen Beatrix swore in the successor to the centre-left cabinet led by Labour's Wim Kok on Monday.\n\nThe charismatic Fortuyn became a huge figure in Dutch politics in a short time with his controversial policies, particularly his hard-line stance on immigration.\n\nHis murder caused a spontaneous outpouring of national grief and self-examination in Holland.\n\nMORE STORIES\n\n Profile: Fortuyn - Man of paradox\n\n TIMELINE: Recent killings of politicians\n\nEXTRA INFORMATION\n\nIn-depth: Netherlands Decides 2002\n\nFollowing Fortuyn's death the LPF scored an unprecedented election triumph, giving it 26 representatives in the 150-seat lower house of parliament to the CDA's 43.\n\nThe CDA has six ministers in the new government, including the foreign ministry, which goes to Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. TheVVD and LPF share the remaining 10 posts.\n\nThe Fortuyn heirs will fill the newly created post of minister for foreigner policy and integration, with the job going to hard-line LPF member, Hilbrand Nawijn.\n\nThe party will also provide the ministers of economic affairs, transport and health.\n\nImmigration and crime\n\nThe ceremony capped a hasty rise in national politics for Balkenende, a 46-year-old professor of economics and Christian philosophy who entered parliament in 1998 and became leader of his party, the Christian Democratic Alliance, 10 months ago.\n\nBoosted by a backlash against immigration and fears of rising crime, the right-leaning parties ousted the reigning alliance of centre-left parties led by former Prime Minister Wim Kok in the May 15 election after eight years in office.\n\nIt is the first centre-right government in 25 years and follows a period of progressive social policies such as regulating euthanasia, permitting gay marriages and showing tolerance toward soft drugs -- all policies opposed by Balkenende's CDA.\n\nAbout half the ministers lack any experience in parliament. Only three have served in previous cabinets.\n\n\"There is a potential lack of stability, both in the LPF and the VVD,\" Kok said on Sunday in his last television interview as government leader.\n\nSince the election the LPF -- only set up in February -- has become known for feuding both in its own ranks and with other parties.\n\nIncoming Health Minister Eduard Bomhoff, an economics professor who was a Labour member until recently, has written deeply critical comments about the new coalition's plans on health and its tight budget restrictions.\n\nReuters reports that LPF's new Economic Affairs, Minister Herman Heinsbroek, has no political background and drew attention by appearing with designer stubble and an open-necked shirt in coalition talks.\n\nThe 51-year-old multi-millionaire, who made his fortune as head of a record company, also announced he would not tolerate long parliamentary sessions.\n\nDutch trade unions have already said they would not just sit back to see what the new government has in store for workers and people on benefits. Plans to cut subsidised jobs, disability benefits and tax-friendly schemes for workers' savings have drawn harsh criticism.\n\nLodewijk de Waal, chairman of the country's largest labour union, was quoted on Monday as saying he was prepared to discuss these policies with the new government, but his organisation already was setting up action committees to prepare strikes if necessary.\n\n\"Chills ran down our spines when we looked at the new government's plans,\" de Waal told Het Financieele Dagblad, a financial daily. \"If you want peace, you must be prepared for war.\""
