        "text": "On February 5th in The Hague, Netherlands at the Dutch Postcode Lottery's annual \"Goed Geld Gala\" Sea Shepherd Conservation Society received a check for 500,000 euros. The \"Goed Geld Gala\" is televised and it is the forum for the lottery to announce the amount of money they have raised for donations to non-profit organizations.\n\nThis year the Dutch Prime Minister, Dr Jan Peter Balkenende, graced the stage of this very prestigious event with the founder of the Dutch Postcode Lottery, Boudewijn Poelmann. In addition to this 2009 donation, Sea Shepherd has also been granted a multi-year donation contract ensuring additional funding in future years. This extremely generous cumulative donation totaling 2,500,000 euros is in recognition of Sea Shepherd's long-term commitment to marine conservation globally and it is amongst the largest since Sea Shepherd was founded in 1977. In these challenging economic times, these funds will help to ensure that Sea Shepherd is able to continue its growing campaign successes and to defend ocean wildlife worldwide. The Dutch Postcode Lottery's support will also stand as a landmark of institutional legitimacy for Sea Shepherd's marine conservation mission and a financial beacon for present and future supporters whose donations help to sustain the organization.\n\nThe Dutch Postcode Lottery was founded 20 years ago as a means to raise money for organizations who advocate for nature conservation, environmental protection, victims of war, and victims of violence and poverty. Half the money raised annually through this lottery is donated to carefully selected non-profit organizations. Since its founding in 1989, the Dutch Postcode Lottery has donated in excess of 2.5 billion euros as part of its commitment to aid non-profit organizations in the essential work they undertake.\n\nThe organizations that received 2009 donations can be found at the following link:\n\nhttp://www.postcodeloterij.nl/GoedeDoelen/AlleGoedeDoelen.htm\n\nSea Shepherd has committed the funding we have been granted to our vigilant battle against illegal Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, to anti-poaching patrols and law enforcement in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands where we have a full-time office, to develop global strategies to stop shark finning, and to continue our battle with the Canadian government over its annual seal hunt in Eastern Canada.\n\nSea Shepherd Europe board members Geert-Jan Vons and Alex Cornelissen,\n\nand Director of Development, Alex S. Earl are presented a check for 500,000 euros\n\nfrom a Postcode lottery representative at the \"Goed Geld Gala\" in the Hague, Netherlands\n\nl-r, Alex Cornelissen, Kim McCoy, Paul Watson and Susi Sperling\n\nat the Dutch Postcode Lottery Headquarters, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nThe head of the Dutch Postcode Lottery, Boudewijn Poelmann, and the\n\nDutch Prime Minister, Dr. Jan Peter Balkenende at the \"Goed Geld Gala\""
