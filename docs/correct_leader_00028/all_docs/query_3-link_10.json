        "text": "Former Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende has joined Hague Corporate Affairs. He will provide strategical advice on European and geopolitical developments to clients, working mainly from Hague’s EU office in Brussels.\n\nBalkenende (65) served as Prime-Minister of the Netherlands from 2002 to 2010. After his political career he devoted his time and energy to the issue of sustainability and circular economy on a national and international level. Balkenende was partner Corporate Responsibility at EY and is currently External Senior Advisor to EY. He is also chairman of the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, a partnership of eight Dutch multinationals committed to sustainable growth. In addition, Balkenende is professor in Governance, Institutions and Internationalisation at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam and member of the Club de Madrid, the organization of former heads of government of democratic nations.\n\n“ At Hague, I want to commit myself mainly at European level with companies and organizations to reflect on the implications of those transitions and to provide advice on strategical choices to make. “\n\nBalkenende: “In a number of sectors major transitions are taking place, like climate change, energy, circular economy and implementations of the SDG’s. At Hague, I want to commit myself mainly at European level with companies and organizations to reflect on the implications of those transitions and to provide advice on strategical choices to make. Those choices can touch upon own core activities but also on relevant partnerships. I look forward to these contacts and to cooperating with my new colleagues at Hague.”"
