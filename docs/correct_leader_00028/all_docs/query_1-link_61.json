        "text": "The Netherlands\n\nThe national elections of 9 June have yet to produce a government. Jan Peter Balkenende, the caretaker prime minister, remains in office while negotiations between the parties continue. Fifty days of intense negotiations between the winners have yet to yield any outline of a possible new coalition.\n\nAfter the one-seat victory of the liberal People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), its leader, Mark Rutte, is struggling to find common ground with the centre-left Labour Party (PvdA) or the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDA). Talks on a coalition between the VVD, the PvdA, the centre-left liberal D66 party and the Greens collapsed in mid-July over cuts to the government budget. Rutte wants to shave €18 billion off government spending, a plan vehemently opposed by Labour, whose leader, Job Cohen, fears undermining the country’s fragile recovery.\n\nEven less agreement has been found with Geert Wilders, leader of the Freedom Party (PVV), who has been lobbying hard to join a VVD-CDA coalition, which would secure a majority in the 150-member parliament. Many liberals and Christian Democrats vehemently oppose a tie-up with Wilders, who wants a freeze on Muslim immigration. Pressure is mounting for compromises, amid growing concern over the economy, Afghanistan and the ballooning budget deficit. Queen Beatrix last week (21 July) appointed Ruud Lubbers, a former prime minister, as a mediator to explore possible solutions. None of the parties has ruled out a ‘national coalition’ between the VVD, PvdA and the CDA.\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgium’s monarch, Albert II, would usually depart on holiday immediately after the national festivities of 21 July, but this year he has stayed in Brussels as negotiations on forming a government continue. Elio Di Rupo, leader of the francophone Parti Socialiste (PS), and Bart De Wever, leader of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), remain upbeat about forming a coalition by October after their successes in the general election of 13 June.\n\nDe Wever wants any coalition to tackle constitutional reform, notably devolving more powers to Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia. Di Rupo has agreed to include a reform package in coalition talks, but the two parties need to win over enough of the other eight mainstream parties to get a two-thirds majority in the parliament for such reform. The need to address the country’s mounting budget problems adds urgency to the talks.\n\nWhether Di Rupo can make the mathematics add up will determine whether the current caretaker government sees out Belgium’s presidency of the EU’s Council of Ministers or a new team of ministers takes over after the summer.\n\nSweden\n\nThe holiday season is drawing to a close in Scandinavia and in Sweden an electoral campaign is under way. Voters are to elect a new government on 19 September and opinion polls suggest that it will be a close contest for the 349 seats in the parliament, the Riksdagen. Fredrik Reinfeldt, who heads the incumbent centre-right coalition, looks likely to remain prime minister. But the opposition team of Mona Sahlin and her Social Democrats are looking to inflict electoral damage on some of Reinfeldt’s coalition partners.\n\nBoth the Centre Party, led by Maud Olofsson, the deputy prime minister, and the Christian Democrats, led by Göran Hägglund, currently minister for health and social affairs, have been losing ground to other small parties (including the far-right Sweden Democrats) and are struggling to stay above the 4% threshold needed to get into the parliament.\n\nBut Sahlin does not have the centre-left to herself. There are other strong candidates – notably Maria Wetterstrand, co-leader of the Green Party, which now commands close to 10% support and is likely to become the country’s third-largest party in parliament. After the quiet of July, when Swedes forsake the cities for holiday refuges in the cool of the forests and coasts, August and September will be politically hot as the country weighs up its preference for red or blue.\n\nDenmark\n\nIn Denmark too, electoral politics is in the air. While Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen is not obliged to call an election until 12 November next year, he might do so before that date – perhaps this autumn if he can get the opinion polls to swing in his favour.\n\nBut since Løkke Rasmussen took over the leadership of the country and of the Liberal Party from Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2008, Danes have been losing confidence in both him and the Liberal Party. Much the same can be said of the Conservatives, the junior partner in the government coalition, and of its leader, Foreign Minister Lene Espersen."
