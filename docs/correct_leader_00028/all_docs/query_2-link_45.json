Digital fabrication techniques allow users to switch from making one part to a completely different one with only modifications in code, not to physical tooling. However, current digital fabrication tools are still difficult to program, tedious, dangerous, and expensive. By lowering the barrier to entry for small-scale automation and digital control, unexpected users can take advantage of advanced manufacturing and automation, disrupting a power structure predicated on mass manufacturing and harnessing economies of scale.\n\nNarayana Peesapaty\n\nNarayana Peesapaty is the Founder and Managing Director of Bakeys Foods.
