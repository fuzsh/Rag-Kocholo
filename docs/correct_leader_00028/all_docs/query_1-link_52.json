        "text": "Dean Arjen van Witteloostuijn will kick off the event and warmly welcome you to your trusted faculty. Professor Mirella Kleijnen, Vice Dean Education, will moderate the gathering.\n\nCapitalism Reconnected with Jan Peter Balkenende\n\nFor this festive occasion, former SBE professor and VU alumnus Jan Peter Balkenende will return to Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In his keynote speech, he will explore the concepts from his new book, Capitalism Reconnected, co-written with VU philosopher Govert Buijs. According to them, capitalism has derailed. A new approach to economics is essential if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and leave the planet in a good condition for future generations.\n\nAfter the event you will receive a copy of the book.\n\nDiscussing Artificial Intelligence with Alumni\n\nHow is technology changing our lives? And what are the opportunities and risks of Artificial Intelligence in business? Organisational scientist Christine Moser will discuss these and other questions with two SBE alumni.\n\nPub Quiz on Faculty History\n\nA festive gathering calls for a festive conclusion. Form a team with alumni from different generations and test your knowledge about the faculty. Student associations Aureus and Kraket have played an active role in preparing the pub quiz, and the quiz master is an emeritus professor who has been long associated with the faculty.\n\nReception\n\nOf course we will take advantage of the opportunity to raise a glass with peers and old acquaintances, in celebration of another 75 years of SBE.\n\nFollowing up with Déjà VU\n\nAfter this exclusive lustrum celebration, you can enjoy the Déjà VU Festival on the campus square. The festival programme offers something for everyone: interactive sessions with scientists, a festival market, music, a science fair, food trucks, and much, much more.\n\nWe warmly invite all alumni from the School of Business and Economics to join us for this festive evening.
