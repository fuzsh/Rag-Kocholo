Trying to understand leadership credibility requires an understanding of leadership (A) and an understanding of the concept of credibility (B). Both things will be established with empirical methods and discussed in this paper. In this paper leadership credibility (B) is a combination of perceived trustworthiness, perceived honesty and perceived competence. These are the characteristics the Dutch want their leaders to display; the characteristics politicians in the Netherlands need to show (real or fake, as long as they do it realistically) in order to become a high credibility leader. That is in order to be believed by the the public. And only if a leader is being believed by the public, he or she will successfully realize political goals. After all, in order to remain stable, a democracy requires a strong public belief in the countries leading persons. The concept of credibility is thus defined as the three things (trust, honesty, competence) the Dutch people find most important for good leadership, which was measured in January 2009, July 2009 and January 2010 by means of a survey (N= approximately 5200). Now in order to understand the concept of leadership, the fourth cabinet Balkenende (2007-2010) offers sixteen interesting leadership cases: a Prime Minister (Jan Peter Balkenende) and fifteen other Ministers (responsible for different portfilio’s such as Finance, Education, Healthcare and so on). Unfortunately it takes too many pages to show and discuss the credibility patterns of all of the Ministers, so only the case of the Prime Minister will be discussed here. 2 SITUATIONAL FACTORS 2.1 Patterns of democracy The Dutch democracy strongly differs from the American, both in the way the democracy was built and in the way the (political) culture influences what\n\n4. 4 politicians do. What kind of democracy is the Dutch one? We can anatomize democracy in several ways (see R. Dahl, 1989, Vanhanen, 1990). One of them is the distinction between majoritarian patterns and consensus patterns. The Dutch democracy is a classic example of a consensus democracy: executive power-sharing traditions, broad coalition cabinets, proportional representation, a multi-party system, interest group corporatism, decentralized government and constitutional rigidity (Lijphart, 1999: 43-45). An example of the other kind is the UK; a classic example of a majoritarian democracy (both on Lijpharts executives-parties dimension and on the federal-unitary dimension). The American democracy also has a high degree of majoritarian patterns, but primarily on the exutives-parties dimension, which is an important determinant of the legitimacy of power and the relation between citizens and public officials. According to Arend Lijphart (1999: 301; 2008) “consensus democracies demonstrate (…) kinder and gentler qualities in the following ways: they are more likely to be welfare states; they have a better record with regard to the protection of the environment; they put fewer people in prison and are less likely to use the death penalty; and the consensus democracies in the developed world are more generous with their economic assistance to the developing nations”. Specific democratic qualities like women’s representation, political equality, participation in elections, and proximity between government policy and voter’s preferences are higher in consensus democracies (Lijphart, 2008: 99). Consensus patterns and majoritarian patterns are likely to ask for different leadership styles. In a consensus democracy leadership is mostly not written with a capital L. Leaders don’t stand alone, they govern together. The public in the Netherlands is suspicious of capital L leadership, which is more of a cultural pattern. Charisma is not neccesarily a good thing for a leader to display. Much rather do the Dutch citizens see a leader who is trustworthy, honest and competent. However, there seems to be a shift towards more appreciation for PR-strategies from within the Ministries… 2.2 Shifting political culture The Dutch cabinet invests millions of euro's branding the Ministries, the governing leader and his or her policies. Among others3, the former Secretary- General of the Dutch ministry of Finance noted that having a good\n\n5. 5 communications director may nowadays be more important than having a good Secretary-General, because 'image is everything' and 'appearance rules over substance'. To Americans, this is so obvious that nobody will write about it in these basic terms anymore. But until recently in the Netherlands (see image 1) the significance of political image was relatively small. To decide who to vote for, other things mattered more, like party preference, ideology and religion. Politicians were expected to be intelligent rather than popular, experienced rather than physically attractive, a good governor rather than a good speaker. The average politician in the Netherlands does not have a particular talent to speech and looks not at all attractive. Until recently, nobody really cared about ‘the outside’, as long as they did their job: govern the country properly. 3 THE MAKING OF A CREDIBILITY INDEX OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP Discovering more detailed patterns of likeability and believability of leaders requires additional research. Political psychology offers a great deal of findings on the leadership-followership relationship the Prime Minister and his citizenry undertake. Late seventies research by Kinder, Peters, Abelson, and Fiske (1980) showed that citizens assess leaders on the basis of earlier shaped prototypes, which are images of what good leadership is and therefore what a good leader should be and do. Aldrich, Gronke & Grynaviski (1999: 3) state that “Prototypes are evaluative rulers against which presidential candidates and presidents are measured” (see also De Vries & De Landtsheer, 2004). Factor analysis research on presidential candidate traits shows a variety of characteristics that play a role in candidate evaluations. Opposing Kinder et. al (1979), Sullivan, Aldrich, Borgida and Rahn (1990) identify their own set of personality assessment characteristics. They found three basic dimensions of personality assessment on which candidates are evaluated: altruism versus selfishness, strength of will versus lack of will power, and trustworthiness versus untrustworthiness. Yet a third set of dimensions along which presidential candidates are evaluated was found by Miller, Wattenberg and Malunchpuk (1986): competence, integrity, reliability, charisma and personal attributes. In the nineties researchers continue using factor analysis on existing data on voter behavior in the U.S. They found traits like dominance and empathy (empathy containing extraversion and charisma) (Pierce, 1993), competence and\n\n6. 6 leadership (Rahn, Aldrich, Borgida and Sullivan, 1990; Caprara, Barbaranelli & Zimbardo, 2002), being extravert and outgoing (Immelman, 1998, '99, 2002, 2003) and being a Teflon-personality to whom 'nothing sticks' and ‘ from whom all hurts fall of’ (Newman, 1999). Contrary to Teflon-personalities, Velcron- personalities never get away with a mistake. Their public missteps keep affecting their image long after the event. These more recently found variables are considered “logically linked to leadership suitability” according to De Vries & De Landtsheer (2009; 6-11). They summarize their 'suitability traits' as being outgoing versus retiring, dominant versus aggrieved, ambitious versus reticent, accommodating versus contentious and dauntless versus conscientious. This shows which characteristics determine voter behavior and candidate appraisal, not what people look for in their leaders. The latter is our field of interest, because we want to define what makes a leader credible. The only researchers who directly measured the characteristics people admire in a leader (a prototype), are James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner. They wrote The Leadership Challenge (2007) and High Credibility Leadership: how leaders gain and lose it, why people demand it (1993 and 2003). They convince their readers of the importance of credibility within any leadership relationship. To every public figure, being credible is key considering we live in a television- and image-dominated society. People will only give another human being 'credit' if they trust the person to do the right thing with their mandate and to take into account the credit-giver's interest. Credibility is about how leaders earn the trust and confidence of their constituents. It's about what people demand of their leaders as a prerequisite to willingly contribute to their hearts, minds, bodies and souls. It's about the actions leaders must take in order to intensify their constituents' commitment to a cause (Kouzes & Posner, 2003: introduction). Following their example we decided to ask Dutch citizens directly what the prototype of a good Dutch executive leader would be. What is it that makes the leader credible according to Dutch citizens? 3.1 The Dutch Prototype: What makes a Dutch political leader credible? A panel (N=5200) of Dutch citizens was asked which characteristics they consider to be key for good leadership executed by a cabinet Minister. Twenty\n\n7. 7 four characteristics make a list of prototypical leadership qualities drawn from the international leadership literature. There is a strong resemblance to the Characteristics of an Admired Leader (CAL, Kouzes and Posner 2007). We used nineteen of twenty characteristics of Kouzes and Posner’s CAL. Five characteristics were added because hypothetically they might of special importance in the Dutch leadership case: trustworthy (which is an important concept within the work of Kouzes and Posner but not one of the qualities of the CAL); integrity (which tuns out to be the fifth quality of the Dutch leadership prototype, Within Kouzes and Posner’s CAL it is part of the trait ‘honesty’); dedicated (because this trait was part of the only survey question about qualities people admire in political leaders that has been measured in the Netherlands, by the SCP, 2005); and sympathy (because this trait is part of the National Election Studies (NKO) in the Netherlands and might be of explanatory value to high credibility leadership because it is often linked to charismatic/empathic leadership). The survey panel was asked to cross five characteristics out of the list of twenty-four. The prototype of a good Dutch executive leader turned out to be mainly concentrated around three characteristics: the people think Ministers need to be, above all, trustworthy, honest and competent (see appendix 1, table 1.). We call this three-scale index the Credbility Index of political Leadership (CIL). 4 MILLON INVENTORY OF DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA 4.1 The MIDC: an introduction The personality of a leader as defined by Theodore Millon (1996) is thought to influence leadership style and performance (Immelman, 1998). The question here is: does it influence the extent to which leaders are credible (perceived trustworthy, honest and competent), too? The Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), a framework with which a politician’s public personality can be investigated, could offer deeper insight when it comes to leadership leadership credibility. Personality was defined by Millon (1996: 4) as “a complex pattern of deeply embedded psychological characteristics that are largely non-conscious and not easily altered, expressing themselves automatically in almost every facet of functioning. Intrinsic and pervasive, these traits emerge from a complicated\n\n8. 8 matrix of biological dispositions and experiential learning, and ultimately comprise the individual’s distinctive pattern of perceiving, feeling, thinking, coping, and behaving.” 4.2 Conceptual Framework Immelman (1998, '99, 2002, 2003) and Steinberg (1999) compiled the Millon Inventory of Diagnostic Criteria (MIDC), based on the DSM III and DSM IV7. The work of Theodore Millon “provides a sound foundation for conceptualizing and assessing political personality, classifying political personality types, and predicting political behavior” (Immelman, 2004: 1-2). Millon’s work can be found in many publications about personality research and personality prototypes: Millon, 1990, 1986a, 1986b, 1991, 1994a, 1994b, 1996, 2003; Millon and Davis, 1998, 2000; Millon, Davis and Millon, 1996; Millon & Everly, 1885). Aubrey Immelman adapted Millon’s method (1969, 1986b, 1990, 1994a, 1996; Millon & Everly, 1985) and developed an instrument to study personality patterns of political leaders. The conceptual framework of the MIDC has twelve scales. Each scale has three (scales 1A through 8) or two (scale 9 and 0) gradations, ranging from normal to maladaptive (Immelman, 2004). In table 7 the personality patterns (scale 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and 0) and gradations (a, b, c, d and e) are displayed. The maladaptive gradations refer to personality disorders from the DSM-III and DSM-IV. 4.3 Data Collection Investigating leadership personality is not easy when face-to-face methods to diagnose one’s behavioral patterns and characteristics are not available. This is the case when it comes to diagnosing historical figures and present day politicians for research within the field of political psychology. Aubrey Immelman (1993c, 1999) started looking into the possibilities of using Millon’s personality patterns to diagnose leaders from a distance and/or from hindsight. He developed the MIDC. This is a sophisticated method applied by means of meta analysis (Immelman, 2004) or ‘semi-qualitative content analysis’ (De Landtsheer et al. 2004: 81). The researcher creates an ‘assessment at a distance’, by analyzing content written by others. Source materials can be\n\n9. 9 biographical works, interviews with the leader or with people who have known the leader well, either personally or professionally. Information can be found within books, newspaper articles and –in theory– other sources too, such as the internet, television interviews or radio performances (although Immelman does not seem to include the non-written sources). 4.4 Scoring The researcher diagnoses leaders (‘target persons’, Immelman: 2004) indirectly using relevant content from biographical source materials or other data produced by biographers, journalists, historians and political analysts (Immelman, Manual-II-Revisited, 2004). During the coding process, in which the researcher codes the relevant pieces of text from the biographical and other sources, the so-called attributes are the first to be distinguished (table 8). Every relevant quote fits attribute A, B, C, D or E: it refers to the target person’s expressive behavior, interpersonal conduct, cognitive style, mood/temperament or self-image. The second step of the coding process is to distinguish one of the scales from table X. If the quote says something about the target person’s expressive behavior (attribute A) and refers to the target person’s respectful behavior, the researcher might decide to code the quote as an attribute A, Scale 6 (conscientious-respectful pattern) quote. The third step of the coding process, is the determination of the intensity with which the leader shows to be a scale-6 leader. In other words, after determining the attribute and the scale, the researcher needs to decide to which gradation the pattern is present. All personality patterns “occur on a continuum ranging from normal to maladaptive”, a being normal, b being exaggerated and c being maladaptive. Gradation a gets one point, gradation b two points and gradation c, being maladaptive, three points. Scale 9 and 0 are maladaptive scales from nature. As a result, gradations a, b and c do not exist within these scales. Only gradations d and e can be labeled on scale 9 and 0. Gradations d and e will get 4 and 5 points. So the third and last step is to decide which gradation the quote refers to: gradation a, b or c (or in case of scales 9 and 0, gradation d or e). After making these three decisions, the quote can be coded as an attribute A, Scale 6,\n\n10. 10 gradation b quote. The researcher labels the quote consequently as an A6b quote. So quotes can be labeled A1Ba (attribute A, Scale 1B, gradation a), B5Ac (attribute B, Scale 5A, gradation c), E4b (attribute E, Scale 4, gradation b) and so on. In total, there are 170 combinations, referred to by Immelman as alphanumerical codes or ‘Diagnostic Criteria’. Within his manual, Immelman (2004) provides 170 different words to typify the diagnostic criteria. See for an example of a score sheet the one of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende in table 12. 4.5 Interpretation After data collection, scoring and a double check executed by an experience psychologist, it is time to start interpreting the outcome. Which scales get the highest scores and what is the gradation of the target person’s scores? Some patterns will be present in gradation a (‘present’), some in gradation b (‘prominent’), c (‘mildly dysfunctional’), d or e (disturbed). 4.6 MIDC Conceptual Basis for Scoring and Interpretation Findings showing up from the source materials are considered “logically linked to leadership suitability” according to De Vries & De Landtsheer (2009; 6-11). Immelman (Manual-II-Revisited, 2004: 1) refers to Simonton, who states that this method in which researchers abstract personality traits from pieces of text about the leader written by others, is valid: “secondary sources can offer the basis for personality assessments as well” (Simonton, 1986: 150, see also 1988). Etheridge (1978) and Simonton (1986, 1988) offered a foundation for Immelman’s work by proving that by extracting personality traits from biographic data can offer insight concerning the relationship between leadership personality and (the success of/ quality of) political leadership. After data collection, scoring and interpreting the results, the researcher explores the implications of a leader’s personality on his or her leadership style, political decision-making, cooperation with others, a leader’s success and even future behavior. In this paper the focus is on the implications of a leader’s personality on his or her public credibility. Immelman (2004) and others have shown that personality explains presidential style, performance and policy preferences. Millon (1994a,\n\n11. 11 1996; Millon & Davis, 2000), Oldham and Morris (1995), and Strack (1997) provided theoretically grounded narrative descriptions of personality patterns which can be helpful for the interpretation of the data. Other researchers (e.g., Barber, 1992; Etheredge, 1978; Hermann, 1987; Renshon, 1996b; Simonton, 1988) show more concrete implications of personality patterns and the way they correlate with the patterns of Millon’s MIDC. 5 THE PUBLIC PERSONALITY OF JAN PETER BALKENENDE 5.1 Introduction: Balkenende’s four terms as a Prime Minister Balkenende has led the Dutch government from the world famous elections of 2002 untill the cabinet resigned in February 2010. In many respects 2002 was an interesting year. Balkenende’s main competitor Pim Fortuyn, a more right- wing politician whose popularity skyrocketed right before the elections, was assassinated. Balkenende led the cabinet through the first decade of the second millennium, which politically, socially, economically and in many other ways was an interesting period of time. Internationally, there was 9-11 and the war against terrorism. Nationally there was a lot going on concerning the integration topic: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a female Dutch-Somali politician politically criticized the Islam and got sent away from politics in 2005 because she had lied about her naturalisation while entering the country in the nineties. There was opinionist Theo Van Gogh who was killed by a young Muslim man after producing a critical movie about the Islam. Balkenende was the Prime Minister during these and many other challenging political happenings and circumstances. Who is this man with the old-fashioned hairdo and Harry Potter-glasses, how did he make it into being a government leader? And the central question of this chapter: what was the effect of his personality on his public credibility? the Dutch were never particularly fond of Balkenende. It seems that he was the best leader out of other alternatives that were considered to be worse. But he outlasted many predecessors by remaining seated for eight years. Aside from the obvious, there must be things that make him credible. 5.2 Source Materials\n\n12. 12 22 articles contained enough evidence to draw a grounded personality profile of Jan Peter Balkenende. Over one hundred articles published between 2006 and 2009 were read and the most relevant 22 were selected for the MIDC coding process as described by Immelman (2004). This resulted in over two hundred relevant quotes. From these articles, 433 codes were given to the quotes, which means 433 times an MIDC criterion was identified (on average, each quote was coded approximately two times). The articles were written by 22 different journalists and researchers who gathered quotes from (former) co-workers, friends, old school mates, fellow governors, politicians and family members of the Prime Minister. As an extra check, the 70 articles not selected as MIDC source materials were extensively analyzed in order to make sure that all the relevant MIDC criteria were scored. From this process nothing new showed up: the Prime Minister’s profile remained the same. Additional research confirmed most of the the personality profile extracted from the 22 selected sources. A few criteria appeared to be not significantly present within Balkenende’s personality, so they were removed from the score sheet. A few adjustments were made after an extended check executed by an experienced psychologist10 and the discussions that followed from this check. 6 RESULTS & INTERPRETATION Jan Peter Balkenende has dominant, ambitious and conscientious patterns. Table 11 shows the Personality Profile of Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, based on source materials written between 2006 and 2010. The score sheet in table 12 shows these and a few other personality patterns present within Balkenende’s expressive behavior, interpersonal conduct, cognitive style, moods and self-image (attribute A through E). 6.1 Balkenende’s Dominant pattern Balkenende first and foremost has a dominant political personality (25 raw points makes 24.8 % of Balkenende’s full profile). This is partly due to the fact that he is the Prime Minister and dominating behavior comes with the job. The source materials show that he is the leader of the cabinet, so everyone naturally expects him to show certain dominant behavior in leading the cabinet and during tv-performances. Many people see him as the leader of the nation, so\n\n13. 13 whenever there is a public problem, they want the Prime Minister to solve it or to have it solved by his cabinet. The power and authority people expect the Prime Minister to display depends on their view on leadership and government. But despite the differences between people, everybody wants the Prime Minister to solve problems - although citizens disagree strongly on which problems that would be - and to lead the country into the right direction. So in order to do a proper job, Balkenende needs to display a certain amount of dominant behavior. This he certainly does, as is shown with the MIDC results. But besides the fact that his job requires him to be dominant, Balkenende really seems to have a dominant personality. A quarter of Balkenende’s character is determined by dominant patterns, so there is robust evidence for a level III personality type. Immelman (2004:16) says about people who score more than 24 points on one of the scales between 1A and 8 (for scales 9 and 0 there is a different approach): Identification of a criterion at both the second (scored 2 points) and third (scored 3 points) levels in all five attribute domains of a given personality pattern (i.e., 25 points), or identification of a criterion in any four of the five attribute domains at all three levels (scored 1, 2, and 3 points) of a given personality pattern (i.e., 24 points), provides quite convincing evidence for the existence of a maladaptively exaggerated or distorted variant of the personality pattern associated with those criteria. Balkenende’s profile lacks only one criterion in order to be called “maladaptively exaggerated”. In other words, Balkenende’s dominance might be slightly maladaptive and possibly causes problems to himself and/or others. Each criterion of the dominant pattern that was found to be present within his profile will be discussed below. This will create a better understanding of the Prime Minister’s personality. Such an analysis can explain why he behaves the way he does, how he is reviewed by others and why. Hopefully it will give some insight into his role as the leader of a new millennium Dutch cabinet and the way he is perceived by the public. Could an MIDC personality analysis explain the extent to which a leader is credible? Each diagnostic criterion will be discussed below. Balkenende is dominant within attribute A: expressive behavior (which might explain credibility\n\n14. 14 shortcomings), B: interpersonal conduct, C: cognitive style, D: mood/temperament and E: self-image. Attribute A. Expressive behavior. Balkenende expresses dominant behavior to two out of the three gradations: he can be commanding (a) and forceful (b). There was not enough evidence to score the gradation c criterion: Balkenende is not aggressive. Attribute E: Self-Image. From the way he presents himself through mass media, it is clear that Balkenende considers himself assertive, competitive and powerful (scale 1A, gradations a, b and c). The Dutch newspaper Het Parool shows that “Balkenende claims to have dragged the Netherlands out of an economic recession, thanks to a conservative and efficient financial approach”34, which reflects a dominant self-image: first he shows to be assertive (gradation a) by claiming his success. Second, he shows to be competitive (gradation b) by showing that he has done what other Prime Ministers could not do. And third, he shows to have a self-image of being powerful by claiming that the recovery of the economy was because of his leadership. The question is, however: is this really Balkenende’s self-image or is this political behavior based on a communication strategy? Without a doubt, the latter is true anyway. Anything about Balkenende that shows up in a newspaper or book will be a result of some kind of (political or communicative) strategy. But how does Balkenende really perceive himself? The source materials show a lot of dominant behavior, mixed with ambitious characteristics. Balkenende is confident, conceited and sometimes even somewhat arrogant (scale 2, gradations a, b and c). As more diagnostic criteria are discussed, It will become clear that Balkenende’s self-image is likely to be assertive (1Aa), competitive (1Ab) and powerful (1Ac), as is also shown by these quotes: “I’m done with the negativity. (…) Internationally we [the Dutch] are performing great. Unemployment is historically low and the Dutch income is one of the highest of all European national incomes. Besides, people are satisfied with healthcare and other public services” and “I have gone through a lot in the last ten years. Bad polls and worse reviews. My last cabinet also had a hard time, but finally in 2006 we received public confirmation of the good work. There is a reason I have won three elections in a row. I consider that appreciation. Look at Mrs. Verdonk. She\n\n15. 15 gets good polling results but that gives her no guarantee to win elections whatsoever Balkenende’s personality shows 24.9 % dominance. 36.7 % of his personality exists of Ambitious (scale 2, 14.8 %) and Conscientious (scale 6, 21.9 %) patterns. 6.2 Balkenende’s Dominant pattern: generalizations Scale 1A, the dominant pattern, refers to individuals who are asserting and controlling, but can be somewhat aggressive. Immelman (2004) says the following about personalities with dominant patterns: The Dominant pattern, as do all personality patterns, occurs on a continuum ranging from normal to maladaptive. At the well-adjusted pole are strong-willed, commanding, assertive personalities. Slightly exaggerated Dominant features occur in forceful, intimidating, controlling personalities. In its most deeply ingrained, inflexible form, the Dominant pattern displays itself in domineering, belligerent, aggressive behavior patterns that may be consistent with a clinical diagnosis of sadistic personality disorder. (Immelman, 2004: 18) Immelman (2004) shows that adaptive variants of the Dominant pattern are similar to the aggressive style (Oldham and Morris, 1995), the forceful style (Strack, 1997), the controlling pattern (Millon, 1994a) and the ‘managerial segment’ of the managerial–autocratic continuum (Leary, 1957). Research shows that people with the Millon’s controlling pattern are likely to show the conscientious factor as described in the five-factor model. Individuals who display controlling behavior (see Millon, 1994a) are likely to be extravert as well, but the correlation is less significant. The factors Neuroticism and Agreeableness however are negatively correlated to Millon’s controlling pattern (Millon 1994a: 82). There is no correlation between the controlling pattern and the openness to experience factor of the five factor model (see Millon, 1994a: 82). Simonton (1988) calls individuals like Balkenende, with an elevated dominant pattern (scale 1A: 25 points), a contentious pattern (scale 5B: 5 points) and a conscientious pattern (scale 6: 22 points) leaders with a ‘deliberative presidential style’.
