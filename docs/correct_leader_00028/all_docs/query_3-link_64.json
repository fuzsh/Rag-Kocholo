        "text": "Philomena Bijlhout, a member of the right-wing List Pim Fortuyn, had on Monday been named junior minister for emancipation and the family. But only seven hours later a Dutch TV station showed pictures of her as a uniformed storm trooper in the service of dictator Desi Bouterse, whose followers murdered 15 opposition activists in 1982. Oops!\n\nRadio Netherlands smirks that Bijlhout can now claim “the shortest career in government in living memory – Guinness Book of Records stuff, indeed”.\n\nDe Volkskrant quotes Bijlhout as saying she “‘had no idea of the existence of these photographs’, which seems strange, as she is seen smiling broadly into the camera”.\n\nIn an editorial, Algemeen Dagblad holds the Netherlands’ new prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, responsible for the goof.\n\n“His inexperience can be excused this time,” the paper writes, “but this first dent came disturbingly quickly.”\n\nAnd De Telegraaf notes that, thanks to a Dutch law on departing members of government, Bijlhout is entitled to six months of reduced pay – around 41,000 euro, or nearly 6,000 euro for every hour she was in office. Verdomme!\n\nBratislava’s English-language Slovak Spectator runs a lengthy interview with populist politician Robert Fico, widely tipped to be the country’s next prime minister. The interviewers worry that Fico is too cosy with Moscow and is busy preparing energy deals with Russia. They question whether he will renege on the current government’s agreement with the EU to close the Soviet-era nuclear plant at Bohunice.\n\nResponds Fico: “Why are we nervous? Let’s not be nervous. All prime ministers, whether it’s [Germany’s Gerhard] Schröder or [Britain’s Tony] Blair, very much like going to Russia and making big deals there. It’s our duty to have good relations with the whole world.\n\n“I can only repeat that the closure of Bohunice is the biggest nonsense this cabinet has done. The biggest.\n\nI want to see the expert report that doubts the plant’s safety. No such report exists.”\n\nLess nervous now?\n\nThe Spectator also covers European Parliament President Pat Cox’s recent trip to Slovakia, in which he described the country’s progress toward EU membership as “impressive” and called on citizens to turn out heavily in the September elections.\n\nCox was also one of the few western leaders to meet with the man likely to win those elections, authoritarian former premier Vladimir Meciar. Cox, according to the paper, “said the meeting was meant as a reflection of the EU’s ideals of respecting political pluralism and different parties, and should not be interpreted as an expression of support for” Meciar or his party, the HZDS.\n\nBritain’s appointment this week of a controversial new Archbishop of Canterbury seems to have attracted the most attention to the job since Thomas à Becket held it.\n\nWelshman Rowan Williams supports gays and women as clerics, has attacked western militarism, thinks Disney is poisoning kids’ minds, likes The Simpsons and Father Ted, and wants to separate church and state in England.\n\nBoth The Daily Telegraph and The New York Times note that Williams speaks seven languages and is currently speaking out against US plans for an invasion of Iraq as “immoral and illegal”. Perhaps he should apply for the job of EU foreign policy chief.\n\nAnd perhaps he should check out the web-based\n\nEUobserver.com, which brings us the week’s juiciest headline, ‘America reaps the fruit of European impotence’, over its account of the denouement of the Spain-Morocco fight over the uninhabited islet of Perejil.\n\n“Ten days of tension between Spain and Morocco over a football field-sized rock saw the European Union and the United Nations helpless,” writes co-editor Daniela Spinant. “The arbiter in a conflict between an EU country and an EU neighbour and friend was Washington.”"
