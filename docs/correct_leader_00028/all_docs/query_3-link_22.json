        "text": "Rediscovery and development of key European values\n\nThis book argues that European economies should be the initiators of a global transition toward a sustainable and inclusive world economy. Together, amid severe geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges, they need to develop their own perspective on what a good economy really is, in distinction to Chinese state capitalism and American big business capitalism. Crucially, this requires the rediscovery and development of key European values, such as human dignity, regenerative/circular thinking, inclusivity and co-creativity. Europe can present a coherent view on responsible capitalism and play a role as a global player for the Common Good in today’s and tomorrow’s world: an economy of hope that is sustainable for future generations.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nProfessor Emeritus Jan Peter Balkenende held the chair of Governance, Institutions and Internationalisation for twelve years at Erasmus School of Law and Erasmus School of Economics. Before that, he served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2002 to 2010. Balkenende currently devotes his time and energy to the topic of sustainability and circular economy on a national and international level. He is Chairman of the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, a partnership of eight Dutch multinationals committed to sustainable growth. In addition, he is External Senior Advisor to EY and a member of the Club de Madrid, the organisation of former heads of government of democratic nations. In October 2022 he was appointed by Royal Decree as Minister of State.\n\nGovert Buijs is Professor of Philosophy of Culture, Politics and Organisation at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He also teaches philosophy at the VU School of Business & Economics. He holds the F.J.D. Goldschmeding chair in Economics in Relation to Civil Society, within the Philosophy department of the Faculty of Humanities of the VU, with the working area 'Social and economic innovation'. The central focus of Buijs' research is 'The Future of Capitalism'."
