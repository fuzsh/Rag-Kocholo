        "text": "The Netherlands is very proud of its flowers! You will find them wherever you go: in the markets, in the fields, on the store shelves, and also, of course, in Dutch homes. From growing flowers from bulbs, to exporting them by air, flowers receive minute attention every step of the way. No country in the world grows as many flowers as the Netherlands. Horticulture is the leading agricultural sector here. The Netherlands accounts for approximately 70% of the world production of flower bulbs, equal to some 10 billion units! The wide diversity of the species grown in the Netherlands has made the country world famous. In less than half a century, up to 600 new varieties have been identified. The tulip, however, remains the most symbolic for the Dutch. This characteristic flower, whose name comes from the Turkish word “tülbend” which means turban, owes its origin to a Flemish ambassador during the 16th century who discovered the seed for the flower in Turkey. Grown between April and May, the tulip delights flower lovers everywhere. Whether in bouquets or gardens, the tulip has become the national flower of the Netherlands.\n\n© Dutch tourist office"
