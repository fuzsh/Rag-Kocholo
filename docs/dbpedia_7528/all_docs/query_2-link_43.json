        "text": "üìå THE PAINTING I INHERITED HAS A LABEL ON THE BACK DECLARING ITS AUTHENTICITY, IS THIS ENOUGH TO SELL IT? Those who are familiar with the art market know that the phenomenon of artist's archives is fairly recent, because until a few decades ago, works were often 'authenticated' simply with a label on the back signed either by the artist or the gallerist. In the event of a sale, is this still valid or is it necessary to get a new one? A distinction must be made: if the label on the back of the work is issued directly by the artist, who is still alive, it may be sufficient. If, on the other hand, the author of the work is not alive, it may be necessary to apply to the relevant archive (beware, however, of DIY) ‚ùå. Let us dispel a myth: there is no definitive certification of the authorship of a work. Therefore, even independent art experts can confirm or disavow the authorship of a work of art, despite the claims of an archive. Did you know? #wealthmanagement #heritage #artmarket\n\nThere is compelling evidence that a urinal ('Fountain') submitted to a New York sculpture exhibition in 1917 was the work of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven rather than Marcel Duchamp as long believed. It is an argument that began more than 20 years ago and has had at least one scholar combing through New England‚Äôs historic plumbing shop records. Von Freytag-Loringhoven was a fascinating figure and a committed member of the Dadaist movement. Even so, many would find it hard to give up Fountain‚Äôs Duchamp attribution. In this story from The Guardian, Julian Spalding, whose book Art Exposed will be released in November, says that the misattribution of Fountain ‚Äúmeans that the whole foundation stone of conceptual art just collapses. A work of art is not a work of art just because somebody says it is. This changes the history of art and has huge implications for the contemporary art market, and the millions that have been invested in it.‚Äù He argues that as a work by Von Freytag-Loringhoven it was more nuanced, with layers of meaning both personal and political. As a work by Duchamp, it was more of a joke, putting two fingers up to the art world establishment. I‚Äôm tempted to think that accepting a different meaning or authorship of this artwork would have no effect on the Contemporary market . If the public was ready to accept the death of art in the bowl of a urinal in 1917, it wouldn't matter who the ‚Äòmaker‚Äô was. Today it could remain a Von Freytag-Loringhoven original and a Duchampian joke. https://lnkd.in/emyduc2u\n\nTechnology also had its impact on the arts, and the rise of computers brought about the field of digital art. So what are the different types of digital art? There are different types of digital painting, different types of algorithmic art, etc. While no one knows for sure how many different types of digital art there are, we are going to look at the 13 most common ones in this post!

About the artist: \"Late Mr. Twombly countered the Olympian loftiness of the Abstract Expressionists by stressing the loquacious, cosmopolitan nature of art and its connectedness not only to other forms of culture but also to the volatile machinations of the human mind and to lived experience. His art functioned as a kind of sieve in which he caught and brilliantly composed the chaotic flood of existing objects or images that the world offered. Mr. Twombly, always cerebral and introspective, isolated individual motifs like targets and flags, mystifying their familiarity with finely calibrated brushwork and collage. His methodical approach to art making helped set the stage for Conceptual Art and influenced generations of artists.\" The not so subtle business of art and the economics of art galleries...High-end art is one of the most manipulated markets in the world. The manipulation of art valuation has further manifested in tax-fraud. Inflated art appraisals cost U.S. government untold millions, a tax-fraud scheme involving donations of overvalued art to four local museums is part of a larger, unchecked problem with inflated art appraisals that has cost the federal government untold millions, a Times analysis has found. https://lnkd.in/dCed9T3r PS: There are probably worse injustices in the world than wealthy people paying too much for art... Here is a good read: https://lnkd.in/dZHatTMp\n\nArt is a language without words; colours are its most eloquent speakers. As silent narrators, they tell tales of joy, sorrow, passion, and tranquillity. They speak in whispers and shouts, guiding our emotions through the visual landscapes‚Äô artists create. So, when you next stand before a painting, let the colours guide your emotional journey, and listen to the stories they strive to tell. In this realm, you‚Äôll find that art communicates not just through its form, but through the very soul of colours themselves."
