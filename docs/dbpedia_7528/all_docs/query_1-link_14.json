        "text": "Having just turned 18, he visited the third Great German Radio Exhibition in Berlin in 1926 on behalf of his boss. A year later, Max Grundig was given the management of Hilpert's Fürth subsidiary. In this branch, he put his knowledge of radio technology into practice and offered radios and accessories for sale for the first time. The branch's main business, however, came from installation orders for the newly built Fürth City Hospital. Through a negotiated share of the sales, he was able to increase his salary from 60 to 600 marks and more. This enabled the 19-year-old to provide for his family well for the first time.\n\nAt the age of 21 he married Berta Haag; their daughter Inge was born in 1930. The marriage ended in divorce shortly afterwards, with him assuming all financial obligations.\n\nMax Grundig quit his job on November 1, 1930 to open his own radio shop in Fürth . It was only with difficulty that he was able to persuade his mother to sign the rental agreement as a guarantor , as requested by the landlord . Together with his partner Karl Wurzer, he opened the company RADIO-VERTRIEB FÜRTH, Grundig & Wurzer OHG, at Sternstrasse 4 in Fürth on November 15, 1930. Selling the radios was difficult at first. At first the business survived on repairs that Grundig carried out himself and on the sale of parts and accessories. The Christmas season in 1930 did bring in some revenue from equipment sales, but it was only slowly that word got around about the quality of the equipment he sold and the good customer service, sales increased and Grundig's shop was able to establish itself. He soon employed two fitters and his three sisters in the company.\n\nIn 1934, Max Grundig paid out his partner and his company moved to a much larger shop at Schwabacher Strasse 1. He now sold radios from all major manufacturers, records, record players, batteries and accessories. He also profited from the different voltages of the power grids in Nuremberg and Fürth (alternating current and direct current). Anyone who moved from Nuremberg to Fürth and simply switched their radio back on would cause the transformer to burn out. Max Grundig repaired these transformers on specially purchased wire winding machines and was soon producing new products for sale to other radio dealers.\n\nIn 1938, Max Grundig married the soprano Anneliese Jürgensen (born November 14, 1913 in Flensburg; died December 14, 2007 in Bad Wiessee), a budding operetta star and daughter of the Flensburg wine merchant Jürgensen, whom he had met in his local bar, the Café Fürst in Fürth. In the same year, he was already producing 30,000 small transformers to meet the growing needs of the armaments industry . When the war began, the company worked primarily for the German Wehrmacht , repairing military communications equipment. Max Grundig was drafted into an army communications\n\nAfter the air raids on Nuremberg in 1943, Grundig had the production facilities relocated to the village of Vach near Fürth and produced transformers, electrical detonators and control devices in the dance hall of the \"Linde\" inn and in the bowling alley of the \"Roter Ochsen\" until the end of the war. The increasing importance of the Radio-Vertrieb Fürth company for the war economy meant that Max Grundig was now declared indispensable (UK) and left military service. He soon received large orders from AEG that meant the production of 10,000 small transformers per day. The client supplied the material and the necessary workers at the same time. 150 Ukrainian forced laborers worked for the company from 1944. Since their supply situation was poor, Max Grundig regularly organized their meals. In his biography collection \"The Great Names\", Prince Konstantin of Bavaria praises Max Grundig, saying that he had kind words and looks for his female forced laborers, \"and, what was even more important for them, always bread.\" Siemens and AEG soon hired engineers, as the orders became more valuable, and towards the end of the war the company also produced the control devices for the V1 cruise missile and the V2 rocket .\n\nAfter the end of the war, Max Grundig was arrested and interrogated by the American military police , but released after three days. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian forced laborers who had worked for Grundig thanked their former boss for the comparatively good treatment: they stayed and guarded the company property in Vach. In doing so, they saved Max Grundig's belongings from looting and destruction.\n\nOn May 15, 1945, Max Grundig reopened the shop in Fürth with a few employees. He had the machines and supplies brought from Vach to a vacated former tin toy factory at Jakobinenstraße 24 in Fürth and in June 1945, with 11 men and 31 women, he began producing universal transformers that could be used in almost any electrical device in a 400 m² space. On November 7, 1945, he received the official business license.\n\nIn August he began developing a tube testing device to put the company on a broader footing. At the end of 1945, this first Grundig device, the \" Tubatest \", came onto the market, albeit still under the name RVF (Radio-Vertrieb Fürth). With it, even laymen could test tubes of any make in a very short time and read off the performance in percent. The Heinzelmann radio, assembled from a kit by the buyer himself, was the foundation for Grundig's success\n\nMax Grundig actually wanted to sell radios again, but production by traditional manufacturers was difficult to get going. The construction of radios required a permit, and sales were strictly managed and required a voucher. Max Grundig overcame these hurdles in December 1945 with a groundbreaking idea: together with his colleagues, he developed a kit that a layperson could easily assemble into a radio, and which he wanted to sell as a \"toy\". This legendary \" Heinzelmann \" radio kit was the start and breakthrough for the RVF's equipment production. The kit (initially nameless in 1946) was most likely named after Hans Bodenstedt 's \"Funkheinzelmännchen\" from 1924/1925, the title character in what was probably the earliest children's series on German radio [1] . Series production finally started in August 1946, and deliveries began in early 1947. By the end of the year, over 12,000 units had been manufactured and sold – a total of 100,000 were to be sold for 22.5 million marks."
