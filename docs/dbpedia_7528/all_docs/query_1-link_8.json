        "text": "\n\nAlthough Grundig produced radios in the 1930's, when most of us hear\n\nthe name we have visions of those large wood cased radios and later\n\ntv's that were so popular from the late 1940's through the early\n\n1970's. Mellow sound, large controls, long analog dials festooned with\n\ncity names, etc. characterized those products. Later they began\n\nproducing some really pricey and good sounding luggable shortwave\n\nradios (Satellit) and a lot of smaller modestly priced units (the many\n\nBoys).\n\nPhilips gradually took a controlling interest over maybe 2 decades\n\nbeginning in the mid 1970's. Grundig sales began to suffer and to me\n\nat least it seemed that they had a tough time breaking free of the\n\nanalog radio model that served them so well for so long. Their digital\n\nSatellit models were not as inspired or made as well as competition\n\nfrom Japan. I suspect the sea-change that overtook the SWL hobby had a\n\nbigger part to play in the downfall of Grundig though. A hobby that\n\nwas once popular with guys of all ages began to grey as the number of\n\npeople twisting shortwave radio dials dropped in the mid 1980's and\n\nplummeted thereafter. There are very few people demanding and\n\ncompanies supplying new shortwave radios compared to what once was.\n\nGrundig got caught up in a combination of inattention by it's owners\n\nand a dramatic drop in demand for it's products. Philips bailed out\n\nlate in the downward plunge and sold the name to yet another group.\n\nThose owners I believe sold the Grundig naming rights to Eton and\n\nlimited the applicability to radios sold in the US. That deal tells me\n\nthe owners were trying to wring whatever cash they could get from a\n\nfailing investment. Grundig reorganized in bankruptcy and sold some of\n\ntheir divisions. The radio products sold in the US under the Grundig\n\nname have no association with Grundig in europe.\n\nGrundig GMBH appears to sell a modest range of tv's, mp players, cd\n\nunits, clock radios that you would find in the catalog of any other\n\nconsumer electronic manufacturer. The range of units for sale may be\n\nbigger than is found on their website. They do sell yacht boy, concert\n\nboy, city boy and other recievers with shortwave coverage. Those units\n\nlook like they come from Degen/Tecsun/Redsun, etc., factories. The\n\nGrundig europe website recognizes Eton on their worldwide map but they\n\ndo not provide any information on their products at all.\n\nI don't know if I would spend too much time trying to figure out where\n\nthe real Grundig radio company is located and where their products\n\nmight be found. My opinion is that if there ever was a real Grundig,\n\nit was disappearing rapidly by the early 1980's. It's just a brand\n\nname pasted on a radio. Since Eton sells a variety of radios under the\n\nEton and Grundig names let's focus less on the name and more on how the\n\nradios in question perform.\n\nThe Eton E1 to me looks like quite a radio for the money. The only\n\nissue I've seen is the lack of a ferrite rod antenna which according to\n\nsome users is not a big deal.\n\nHi!\n\nSomething I've never seen anybody referring to is the striking\n\nsimilarity between a Sony ICF2010 and a Grundig Satellit 700. Inside\n\nthat is. I personally own samples of both radios and also have the\n\nschematics of both radios.\n\nThe Satellit 700 is more or less an upgraded ICF2010 (ICF2001D).\n\nThe synthesizer is using the same chips in a similar configuration\n\n(Sony CX7961 and NEC uPC1037 chips two of both). The AM/FM-IF chip is\n\nthe same (Sanyo LA1205) as is the synchronous demodulator (Sony CX857).\n\nThe major differences of a SAT700 compared to ICF2010 are the inclusion\n\nof RDS on FM and the use of switched varactor tuned filters on SW.\n\nOtherwise the receivers look almost identical to an engineers eye.\n\nIt seems it would have been very unlikely for Grundig to be able to\n\nsource the Sony chips without a mutual agreement on the design ie.\n\nGrundig must have bought the basic design from Sony! In the 60's and\n\n70's the japanese very accused of ripping european and US designs.\n\nLater on it seems that the roles did change a bit!\n\nComing back to changes on the original design Grundig did produce\n\na few bugs. The first one is quite often referred to as rumbling\n\nsynchronous AM. The main reason for this is that Grundig did mess\n\nwith the time base of the SAM-PLL. In SAT700 the LP-filter has a\n\n56k resistor and a total of 11nF capasitance. In the ICF2010 the\n\nsame components are 10k and 11nF. Correcting the Grundig circuit\n\nto comply with the Sony original does away with most of the rumble.\n\nAt it's easiest you just replace the 10nF of \"CC817\" with a 1nF capasitor.\n\nThe second bug is rather serious as well. The varactor tuned SW-\n\nfrontend filters are switched with PIN-diodes. In the Grundig\n\ndesign the diodes of the filter in use have low forward bias.\n\nThe diodes of the remaining filters have their cathodes and anodes\n\nat the same voltage ie. they have zero bias. For best intermodulation\n\nperformance one would reverse bias the non-conducting diodes. In my set\n\nI reverse biased the diodes and the improvement in large signal handling\n\nwas remarkable.\n\nWhat you need to do is to disconnect the resistors CR228,233,238,239,\n\n245 and 246 from +AM+5V rail and connect them somewhere higher. In my\n\nset I used the +30V tuning voltage generator and by a high impedance\n\nvoltage divisor produced +10V that I connected the resistors in to.\n\nThis resulted in a few volts of reverse bias for the diodes.\n\n(Actually in the easiest implementation you remove the aforementioned\n\nresistors and add new ones on vias on the PCB near the connector of the\n\ncable going to the CPU-board...)\n\n-Vesa-\n\nVesa wrote:\n\n> Hi!\n\n>\n\n> Something I've never seen anybody referring to is the striking\n\n> similarity between a Sony ICF2010 and a Grundig Satellit 700.

It takes much more than\n\ncomponents to make a good shortwave radio. It takes attention to\n\ndesign, details and scrupulous assembly techniques. Grundig fell down\n\nin those categories. Sony on the other hand set the benchmark for a\n\nquality product.\n\n>\n\n> Coming back to changes on the original design Grundig did produce\n\n> a few bugs.

I\n\nwould send that radio back for a full refund. That lack of quality in\n\na radio at this price level is inexcusable.\n\n>\n\n> -Vesa-\n\nWell,\n\nWith all due respect I doubt if you have ever seen the schematics of\n\nthe two sets or indeed had a look inside them. Having a peek inside it's\n\nreally clear that the quality of construction of a ICF2010 is inferior\n\nto that of a Satellit 700. Regarding schematics, to talk about \"carbon\n\ncopy\" could be pushing it a bit but clearly the SAT700 is an attempt to\n\nimprove the original Sony design. You really have to see the schematics\n\nyourself to get the point. In my first message I only mentioned some\n\ndetails quite obvious. (Could start to talk about the dual-loop\n\nsynthesizer design on both sets using the same components...)\n\nRegarding how Grundig came to use the Sony design, we can only\n\nspeculate. As far as I can remember at the time in question (15-20 years\n\nago) the now usual OEM/ODM/ref.design sort of business model wasn't that\n\ncommonplace.\n\nAnyway claiming that SAT700 quality is inferior to ICF2010 quality is\n\nstretching it a bit. In my opinion credit should be given to both\n\nreceivers. For ICF2010 for being progressive in design (in true Sony\n\ntradition) and for SAT700 for it's high quality. At present both sets\n\nare collectible. The Satellit 700 especially for being the last of the\n\nline and Sony for it's revolutionary design (SAM). Regarding the\n\nfront-end PIN-diode bug the Satellit 700 still manages a higher dynamic\n\nrange than the ICF2010. Correcting the bug only realizes what the design\n\nshould have been capable of firstplace. (Responsability of the circuit\n\nseems to have been given to a summer trainee perhaps.)\n\n-Vesa-\n\n"
