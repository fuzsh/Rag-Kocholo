        "text": "Fellow Radiophiles,\n\nI just concluded a translation from from German to English, of the Repair Helper with Alignment instructions that our Hans Knoll wrote in 1965, for the Grundig 2550 AM/FM/SW/Phono 3 tube radio that he also designed. I own a very fine specimen of this very fine performer.\n\nThe 2550 is the last of this extremelly sucessful series of 3 tube AM/FM radios that lasted for 10 years, starting in 1955.\n\nBerhard Nagel has a very nice post about his restoration of the model 80, which was the first radio of this series.\n\nHans Knoll has contributed widely on this and many other topics, including a complete list of all models of this series of Grundig 3 tube AM-FM radios, many of which he designed..\n\nThis English translation of the Grundig 2550 Repair Helper with Aligment instructions includes additional explanatory notes and text that fill in details about German Radio alignment practice that was well known by German trained technicians in the 1960's, but is needed for today's radio collector. The German language original for this translation was dowloaded from the 2550 model page.\n\nThis translation includes contributions from the original author, Hans Knoll, who clarified many of the circumstances around each alignment instruction, and gave his approval for the final translation. Prof. Dietmar Rudolph, also contributed clarifications of concepts in the original instructions that did not translate well. Finally, Thomas Albrecht, substantially improved the first draft that I initially edited with Google-Translate.\n\nThank you gentlemen and fellow radiophiles, for your patient help and guidance.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n-Joe"
