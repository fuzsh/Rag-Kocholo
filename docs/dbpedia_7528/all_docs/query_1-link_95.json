        "text": "“Thirdly, it has hitherto been custom to regard us as your serfs, which is regrettable considering that Christ redeemed and freed us all with his precious blood, the shepherd just as much as the noble. Therefore, with this text, we hereby declare that we are free and want to be free.” The third of the 12 Articles adopted by the Upper Swabian peasants in March 1525\n\nAn odd criticism often levelled at the German Democratic Republic is that its historians were guilty of a highly selective interpretation of the past. While true to an extent, it seems only natural for a country that claimed to have “radically broken with the reactionary past” to foreground “progressive” aspects of German history. Forming one of the demographic cornerstones of the self-styled Workers’ and Peasants’ State, the peasantry and its history, particularly the more revolutionary chapters, played an outsized role in East German historiography.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy peasant-related event elevated to grand prominence in GDR history-writing and popular culture was the great Peasants’ War of 1524/25, the story of which had been so brilliantly told by Wilhelm Zimmermann as a Manichean struggle between “freedom against inhuman oppression, light against darkness” in the 1840s and which was later put into a coherent materialist and class context by Friedrich Engels in 1850.\n\nSo, what was the Peasants’ War of 1524/25? In short, it was a large-scale uprising by the German peasantry, chiefly concentrated in the Southwest, in alliance with a few sympathetic/dissatisfied imperial cities, knights and petty nobles against increasingly unbearable feudal domination and, coinciding with the Reformation, abuses by the church. At the end of the revolt, more than 100,000 poorly armed peasants lay dead and many regions were depopulated and devastated for decades to come.\n\nWriting for Medievalists, Kelly DeVries asserted that the war started in the fall of 1524 when “Helena, countess of Lupfen, required [her peasants] also to collect snail shells for use as thread spools…dissatisfaction against the added work grew among these peasants, with an estimated 1200 gathering in protest within a few days.” Be that as it may, trying to pinpoint a specific trigger is ultimately an exercise in futility because it discounts the years and decades of unrest that preceded the Peasants’ War. Indeed, as Zimmermann wrote in the first volume of his exhaustive history: “[The uprising] was not something that came out of the blue, it was not a random occurrence; it was deeply rooted in both society and the times…The inclination of the people towards rising was as old as their oppression. Chains whet the love for freedom.”\n\nDeVries’ hamfisted attempt at discrediting the Marxist interpretation that peasants revolted because “they were oppressed by those who…essentially ‘owned’ them” — which doesn’t even seem like a specifically Marxist idea, one might add — comes undone when he formulates his silly gotcha that Marxism can’t answer the simple question of why peasants didn’t revolt more often if they truly were so oppressed.\n\nHe writes: “The number of peasant revolts throughout all of history are in fact very few, with larger-scale peasant revolts…even rarer.” Very few relative to what? But even if we take this at face value, nobody is denying the fact that peasants in some areas and eras — like in England prior to across-the-board enclosure — enjoyed some degree of prosperity, but to argue that the history of the peasantry isn’t a history in large parts shaped by brutal oppression seems odd.\n\nLet’s consult Zimmermann again, who eloquently described the lot of the German peasantry as follows: “Crushed by a dual despotism, the despotism of arbitrariness and the despotism of the law — because injustice had been given a legal basis — inured merely to serve and produce, the common man lived on his domestic soil as an alien in his own home, toiled by the tart sweat of his brow without being able to enjoy the fruits of his labour, and endured humiliation and abuse and bitter hunger, while the rulers revelled in their castles, bishops’ palaces and abbeys. The German people were like Odysseus from the Greek tale, who sat in beggar’s clothing on the steps of his own palace and was being maltreated by the shameless suitors with flung bones and blows.”\n\nThe explanation DeVries provides for his own question is quite pathetic: “The answer to the lack of frequency is actually simple: even if they had the slightest initial impact on agricultural, economic, or political policy, peasant revolts were never successful.” This is a complete nothingburger of a response, it doesn’t explain anything, it’s just outcome bias. If you ignore the several peasant uprisings in ancient China that literally affected dynastic change, then yes, it’s true that peasant insurgencies like Wat Tyler’s and John Ball’s revolt or the Peasants’ War didn’t improve their lot long-term. Marx, too, noted this in The German Ideology: “The great risings of the Middle Ages all radiated from the countryside, but…remained totally ineffective because of the isolation and consequent crudity of the peasants.”\n\nYet to posit mere defeatism as a catch-all, “simple” answer to some supposed paucity of uprisings is pitiful coming from a historian. To be sure, defeatism, lordly intimidation and a lack of revolutionary fervor among propertied peasants scared of losing what little they had are all factors that can help explain why peasants would refuse to take up arms, but they don’t in any way refute the purportedly uniquely Marxist idea that peasants were oppressed — in fact, later on in the piece, DeVries enumerates the peasants’ grievances and thus reveals their misery! Nor does the sheer tenacity and relative frequency with which German peasants repeatedly rose during the late 14th and early 15th centuries back up the claim that they were scared of failing; only after the most barbarous reprisals or crushing defeats did peasants keep their heads down for any extended period of time.\n\nWriting about one of the peasant hordes during the war, DeVries notes with surprise that it was “administratively well organized. Where they learned how to organize in such a manner is unknown.” The fact that this causes surprise implicitly gives away another reason why large-scale revolts were rare: the primitive — or nonexistent — means of communication and infrastructure of the times made it nigh on impossible for peasants to covertly organize and coordinate nationwide activity.\n\nAny tip-off and the authorities were able to nip potential insurgencies in the bud before they kicked off, as indeed happened several times in the build-up to the Peasants’ War. “The conspirators,” wrote Engels about the Bundschuh or Union Shoe rebels of the 1490s, “held their meetings at night on the lonesome Hungerberg. Membership in the Union was connected with the most mysterious ceremonies and threats of severest punishment against traitors. Nevertheless, the movement became known about Easter Week of 1493, the time appointed for the attack on Schlettstadt. The authorities immediately intervened. Many of the conspirators were arrested and put on the rack, to be quartered or decapitated. Many were crippled by chopping their hands and fingers, and driven out of the country. A large number fled to Switzerland.”\n\nDespite constant setbacks, the peasants just kept conspiring. This perseverance resulted in the surprising level of organization that set the German Peasants’ War apart from most rural uprisings of the time. The decades of oppression and increasing economic and financial burdens engendered a veritable fermentation that would occasionally bubble to the surface after which the dispersed remnants that had survived the lords’ ferocious vengeance would move elsewhere to agitate and create another rudimentary underground network.\n\nIndeed, Engels marvelled at the remarkable persistence of the Bundschuh conspirators: “The Union Shoe, however, was far from being annihilated and continued its existence in secret. Numerous exiles, spread over Switzerland and South Germany, became its emissaries. Finding everywhere the same oppression and the same inclination towards revolt, they spread the Union Shoe over the territory of present-day Baden. The greatest admiration is due for the tenacity and endurance with which the peasants of upper Germany conspired for thirty years after 1493, with which they overcame the obstacles to a more centralised organisation in spite of the fact that they were scattered over the countryside, and with which, after numberless dispersions, defeats, executions of leaders, they renewed their conspiracies over and over again, until an opportunity came for a mass upheaval.”\n\nWhile the Peasants’ War was by some distance the greatest — and final — explosion of this general fermentation, it was far from the only one. Already in 1476, there was the large uprising of the Piper of Niklashausen, whose sermons, preaching the abolition of taxes, tithes and corvée services as well as the free use of commons, attracted crowds of up to 40,000 and during which some thirty-odd thousand peasants took up arms. After being deceived by the Bishop of Mainz, they dispersed and many of them were subsequently slaughtered.\n\nIn the 1490s, there was peasant unrest from Frisia and the Netherlands all the way down to the southernmost parts of Germany and Switzerland. In 1500, the Dithmarschen Peasants’ Republic in northern Germany (a republic, it must be said, that was controlled by wealthy peasants) defeated a professional host of John I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden to remain independent (until 1559). By 1517, the year that Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses on the door of the All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg, the Bundschuh had spread all throughout Alsace and the Black Forest region, and unrest had also engulfed Württemberg in 1514 after which at least 1700 peasants were tortured; in the meantime, a massive peasants’ war broke out in parts of modern-day Austria and Slovenia with reportedly up to 90,000 armed peasants taking part. The peasantry’s struggle for freedom became a central theme in GDR historiography — and propaganda — and the establishment of the Workers’ and Peasants’ State came to be seen as the successful culmination of its centuries-long effort.\n\nThe above-mentioned Luther was one of the main protagonists of the Peasants’ War and his role in the uprising informed the initial perception of him in the GDR. He was an ambiguous, vacillating figure, compared by Engels to the German bourgeoisie of the revolution of 1848. His influence was clearly discernible in the expression of the peasants’ grievances. “In his appeals against the clergy,” noted Engels, “in his preaching of Christian freedom, peasants and plebeians perceived the signal for insurrection.” Luther, however, ultimately sided with the German nobility and called for the brutal suppression of the rebellion.\n\n“Compared with the hordes of peasants, the servants of the Roman Sodom were innocent lambs, sweet-tempered children of God. Burgher and prince, noble and clergyman, Luther and the pope united ‘against the murderous and plundering hordes of the peasants.’ ‘They should be knocked to pieces, strangled and stabbed, secretly and openly, by everybody who can do it, just as one must kill a mad dog!’ Luther cried. ‘Therefore, dear gentlemen, hearken here, save there, stab, knock, strangle them at will, and if thou diest, thou art blessed; no better death canst thou ever attain.’ No false mercy was to be practised in relation to the peasants. ‘Whoever hath pity on those whom God pities not, whom He wishes punished and destroyed, shall be classed among the rebellious himself.’”\n\nDue to this stance, Luther was seen as something of a traitor at first. Over time, however, and particularly from the early 1980s onwards, this view became more differentiated, and in fact was quite literally turned on its head, as the GDR sought to get the better of West Germany in the battle for legitimacy and perhaps also in an attempt to reconcile with the Protestant church, which had always been a thorn in the ruling party’s side. The Federal Republic of Germany naturally saw itself as the sole legitimate German nation and thus also claimed all aspects of Germany’s past. Historians in West Germany had no moral qualms about extolling and whitewashing even the most reactionary and violent figures and periods in German history. If the GDR wanted to boost its standing in the German genealogy, it had to broaden its horizon beyond revolutionary history and also partake in some of this whitewashing.\n\nThus, important historical personalities like Luther and Otto von Bismarck were reappraised and positives highlighted. Luther’s world-historic deed in kickstarting the Reformation was recognized, as was Bismarck’s progressive role in unifying Germany, even if this cunning arch-reactionary did it with blood and iron. Mike Dennis wrote in 1988: “The major reinterpretations have affected three of the main representatives of the reactionary past: Luther, Frederick II (1740–86) and Bismarck. While it would be a gross misrepresentation of the achievements of GDR historical science to suggest that valuable research had not already been undertaken on these three figures and their societies, the recent historical reprocessing has brought to light their positive achievements, above all those of the great Protestant reformer. Luther…was lauded by Gerhard Brendler of the Central Institute of History at the Academy of Sciences as ‘a progressive agent in the process of the early bourgeois revolution’ whose achievements ‘enabled bourgeois politics to break away from feudalism.’”\n\nThomas Müntzer, on the other hand, wasn’t subject to this revision; his role as the ideological leader, the John Ball of the Peasants’ War or a kind of German Thomas More, was unambiguously depicted favourably. A student of Luther’s, the apprentice Müntzer would soon outdo his master. Müntzer’s preachings weren’t merely targeted at the church hierarchy but against the entire feudal order.\n\nCloaked in the religious tongue of his day, Müntzer’s radical ideas were seen by Engels as proto-communistic: “Only in the teachings of Müntzer did these communist notions [of the Czech Taborites] find expression as the desires of a vital section of society. Through him they were formulated with a certain definiteness, and were afterwards found in every great convulsion of the people, until gradually they merged with the modern proletarian movement. Something similar we observe in the Middle Ages, where the struggles of the free peasants against increasing feudal domination merged with the struggles of the serfs and bondsmen for the complete abolition of the feudal system.”\n\n“Müntzer’s political doctrine followed his revolutionary religious conceptions very closely, and as his theology reached far beyond the current conceptions of his time, so his political doctrine went beyond existing social and political conditions. As Müntzer’s philosophy of religion touched upon atheism, so his political programme touched upon communism…By the kingdom of God, Müntzer understood nothing else than a state of society without class differences, without private property, and without superimposed state powers opposed to the members of society. All existing authorities, as far as they did not submit and join the revolution…must be overthrown, all work and all property must be shared in common, and complete equality must be introduced. In his conception, a union of the people was to be organised to realise this programme, not only throughout Germany but throughout all of Christendom.”\n\nAccordingly, Müntzer was lionized in the GDR as one of Germany’s earliest revolutionaries. In 1956, the biopic Thomas Müntzer — Ein Film deutscher Geschichte, a 130-minute tour de force documenting Müntzer’s split with Luther and his involvement in the peasants’ movement, was released to great fanfare. Film studio DEFA spared no expenses: it was “a lavish production, one of DEFA’s most expensive.” Stamps bearing Müntzer’s face, too, were issued in great quantities; in 1953, a Müntzer stamp was part of the “German patriots” series and several special stamps were printed in 1989, the 500th anniversary of his birth. Collective farms, youth camps and other institutions bore his name.\n\nContrary to the prevalent calumny heaped on GDR historiography nowadays — “it was all mandated by the regime and therefore should be dismissed,” which (purposefully) ignores the lively intellectual debates about Müntzer and Luther among East German historians — adulation for Müntzer and the peasants was not an artificial, mythical invention by the SED; it predated the GDR by decades. In fact, it was started by Zimmermann, the progressive liberal Protestant theologian who, as illustrated earlier, had great sympathy for the cause of the peasantry and his confessional comrade Müntzer. Zimmermann’s seminal history (and Engels’ article in Marx’ Neue Rheinische Zeitung) shaped the perception of the Peasants’ War and Müntzer in communist and social-democratic circles well before the establishment of the GDR.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, world-renowned artist Käthe Kollwitz began reading Zimmermann’s history and was inspired to give her spin on the Peasants’ War. Her eye-catching and stirring series of etchings — including the transfixing Whetting the Scythe or Black Anna leading the Outbreak — on the events of 1525 further entrenched the idea of the peasants leading a righteous struggle against the most barbaric oppression. Kollwitz came to be celebrated in both East and West Germany — in the former, of course, this celebration was Vereinnahmung [appropriation] and mythologization of her legacy for devious ends and in the latter merely respectful commemoration!\n\nWe could go back even further than Zimmermann, too. Albrecht Dürer, one of Germany’s greatest artists, witnessed the Peasants’ War first-hand and was one of the few notable contemporaries who decidedly supported the peasantry’s cause. Agricultural workers had featured prominently in Dürer’s art even before the great rising. After its defeat, Dürer planned to commemorate the effort with a monumental pillar atop which was to rest a peasant in the easily recognizable Pensive Christ pose with a sword in his back.\n\nDürer’s 1497 copper engraving Three Peasants in Conversation embellished the back of a 1946 softcover reprint of Engels’ work, which would continue to be periodically reissued throughout the GDR’s existence. Because Zimmermann and Engels had already elucidated the history of the uprising masterfully, GDR-era writings on the matter largely refrained from a complete retelling of the story and instead sought to fine-tune the theoretical framework around it, defining the period from 1476 to 1525 as an early bourgeois revolution. Similarly, West German historian Peter Blickle argued that the Peasants’ War wasn’t merely a peasant rising, but a full-on “revolution of the common man.”\n\nArtistic renditions of the Peasants’ War found similar levels of proliferation in the GDR as the classic histories on the topic. Particularly the 1950s could be described as the high watermark of the revolt’s popularity. Besides the release of the Müntzer biopic, the public was presented with countless paintings and statues dedicated to the peasants and their leader in the formative years of the GDR as the country was still in the process of creating its unique identity. Like every great societal transformation, so, too, did the socialist reshaping of life in East Germany unleash an endless fount of creative activity and revolutionary fervour. Among some of the most notable artistic interpretations of the Peasants’ War were the scores of illustrations made by Hans Baltzer that decorated many a reprint of Zimmermann’s history.\n\nLea Grundig continued the Kollwitzean tradition of etchings from as early as 1930 onwards. Unlike Kollwitz, Grundig would live to see the founding of the GDR, serving six years as the president of the country’s Visual Artists’ Association. Karl-Georg Hirsch, meanwhile, created a truly unique and marvellous series of woodcuts (see the Piper section from earlier for one example). Plenty of other compositions, particularly in the style of socialist realism, catch the eye, too. The undisputed pinnacle of Peasants’ War and perhaps East German art as a whole, however, was actually completed not during the nation’s formative years but shortly before its demise.\n\nIt took Werner Tübke 12 years to finish his gigantic painting, Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany, which can now be marvelled at in the Panorama Museum in Bad Frankenhausen, the site of the decisive battle where Müntzer was captured (and later executed). More a kind of Renaissance-esque painting than explicitly socialist realist, this epic piece of art shows, among the battle and other scenes, a resigned Müntzer with a lowered Bundschuh flag. The museum was opened in the fall of 1989 as part of the celebrations of Müntzer’s birth. Soon, though, the GDR would be swallowed up by West Germany, and the creation of the “kingdom of God,” the society without class differences envisioned by Müntzer and Engels, experienced a major setback."
