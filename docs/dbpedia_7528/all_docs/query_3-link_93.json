        "text": "Opening: $180\n\nUnsold\n\nThree children's books with illustrations by Leah Grundig (1906-1977). Born in Germany, Grundig was a member of the Communist Party and married to the German-Christian painter Hans Grundig. The couple were imprisoned in concentration camps as a result of their Communist affiliations. Leah succeeded in escaping and immigrated to Israel in 1940, with the assistance of Nahum Eitan (Itin). In 1949, during one of her visits to Germany, she met, by coincidence, her husband, who had also survived the camps. She left Israel and returned to Communist East-Germany, leaving behind her collection of paintings.\n\n1. Kahana, Batya. Tapu'ach HaZahav HaGe'eh. Illustrations: Leah Grundig. Tel Aviv, [1944]. Fair-poor condition, significant moisture stains.\n\n2. Chukovsky, Korney. Shemesh Genuvah. Hebrew: Leib Kuperstein, illustrations: Leah Grundig. Tel Aviv,[1944]. Good condition, stains on cover.
