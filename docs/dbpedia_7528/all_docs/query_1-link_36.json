        "text": "In this paper, I will argue, that, in the 1960s, when the Cold War reached its peak and relations between Israel and the GDR were at a low point, two important figures of East German – Lea Grundig – and Israeli – Miriam Novitch – postwar cultural history were undermining the supposed stability of the two ideological blocs and proved so, that the exchange of thoughts, ideas, and artworks was possible even in the “hot phase” of the Cold War, roughly between the Cuba Crisis of 1962 and the 1975 Helsinki conference. To this dominant Cold War narrative of two aggressive and hostile ideologies, I will add a concrete story of personal Cold War relationships to show how this has influenced art, remembrance, and politics in the 1960s. In order to do so, I will present you some aspects of the correspondence between Grundig and Novitch (1965-9) which I have discovered in 2010 in Grundig’s archive at the Academy of Arts Berlin. It will be shown that the letters by Novitch to Grundig prove that artworks of the Jewish East German Communist and Grundig could be seen as a sign of spiritual resistance and a unique artefact of the commemoration of the Holocaust by a surviving, politically engaged German Jew."
