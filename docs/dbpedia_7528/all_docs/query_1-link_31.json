        "text": "Germany is known for producing generations of brilliant artists, writers and thinkers. The country also played a key role in two devastating wars during the 20th century.\n\nBut there’s much hidden in Germany’s cultural and aesthetic history since World War II. A new exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art pulls back the veil, revealing a plethora of artistic activity behind the Iron Curtain, as well as rarely seen work from both East and West Germany.\n\n“Art of Two Germanys/Cold War Cultures” is the first new exhibition at LACMA’s Broad Contemporary Art Museum since its grand opening in February. It’s also the first exhibit in the United States to examine the range of art created in Germany during the Cold War, according to LACMA.\n\n“Art of Two Germanys” is a sprawling, often fascinating and generally impressive exhibition, showcasing about 300 works by 120 artists. Well-known artist such as Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter are featured. But the show also highlights works by dozens of lesser-known artists who operated under the global radar – and often under tense conditions – offering a more complex view (beyond Expressionism) of what German art is all about.\n\nThe show, which takes up the entire second floor of BCAM, is organized chronologically. The first section covers the years just after the war, 1945-1949.\n\nThe second section highlights works done during the 1950s. Section three is devoted to the revolutionary 1960s and ’70s.\n\nThe final section explores art made during the 1980s, all the way up to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nA BITTER AFTERMATH\n\nMany of the paintings and images in the opening section are harsh and haunting, reflecting the bitter aftermath of post-war Germany. Immediately following its defeat, the once-powerful nation that almost completely conquered Europe was divided into four zones: American, French, British and Soviet.\n\nSuch a carving up was a stark indication that Germany not only lost the war, but its people also lost their pride and, to a large degree, their national identity.\n\nA collection of six black and white photographs by Richard Peter Sr. clearly convey the death and destruction suffered by the German citizenry. His stark and uncensored images are filled with rubble, skeletons, and decimated buildings.\n\nKarl Hofer offers another bleak, dark vision of Germany after the war. His “Totentanz(Dance of the Dead),” a 1946 oil on canvas, depicts a crowd of people against black paint. They’re wearing death masks and two couples in the front are engaged in a ghoulish dance.\n\nHans Grundig’s “To the Victims of Fascism” (1946/49), is a painful, yet colorfully beautiful, oil on fiberboard. The painting depicts a concentration camp victim lying on his back, presumably dead of dying, while black crows fly in the distance. A skeleton draped in blue, representing death, hides its face in anguish or shame near the feet of the prisoner.\n\n“To the Victims” is a rare, early acknowledgment in Germany of the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nWe also see some abstraction and the influence of Western European art movements on West Germany in this section. Willi Baumeister’s “Urformen(Original Forms)” (1946) echoes German/Swiss painter Paul Klee’s work, while his “Atlantis” (1947) resembles Joan Miró during the Spanish master’s 1930s shapes and shades period.\n\nSTATE-DIRECTED ART\n\nThe second section, covering the 1950s, reveals the influence of Soviet and communist imagery and symbolism on East Germany. Social realism was the order of the day in the east, an official aesthetic sanctioned and summoned by the state to further political and ideological goals.\n\nFritz Cremer provides an appropriately proletarian, “everyman” monumental sculpture with his 1952 bronze, “Erster Entwurf zum Buchenwald Denkmal(First Version of the Model for the Buchenwald Memorial).” Seven men are staring down an unknown enemy, unified in their resolve and anonymity.\n\nKonrad Klapheck’s “Der Wille zur Macht(The Will to Power)” (1959) is a not-so-subtle reference to Friedrich Nietzsche’s text of the same name. The painting of a typewriter demonstrates strict adherence to lines, rows, form and order, implying not only the power of the written word, but also the rigidity and strength of the Nazi regime.\n\nAs for West Germany, we see the continuing influence of Western Europe and the United States on those artists and their work. One can easily make connections between artists featured in this section and their American or European counterparts: Gerhard Hoehme and Yves Klein, Wolf Vostell and Robert Rauschenberg, and so on.\n\nThe 1950s section also includes functional, if not inspired, depictions of rebuilding in the works of Heinz Drache and Otto Nagel.\n\nOne of the highlights of this section is Werner Tübke’s “White Terror in Hungary,” circa 1957, a two-part oil on canvas. It’s mysterious, social realist and suggestively narrative. The story behind its creation is almost as interesting as the piece itself.\n\nThe viewer enters more familiar territory with the galleries that cover the 1960s and ’70s. Here we have German art stars Beuys, Polke and Richter. We can also see many examples of German Pop art, conceptualism and performance, as well as forays into video and the avant-garde.\n\nThere’s more Polke than you can shake a stick at. Some works are very good, nice examples of Polke’s “Capital Realist” style. Other pieces are not exactly his greatest hits, but sometimes you just accept the wheat andthe chaff.\n\nRichter has some amazing works on display, many of them black and white oils on canvas. They look like blurred portraits from a previous era, suggesting loss and changing notions of the past. His 1966 installation “Volker Bradke” is a trip – too bad you can’t walk into this homage to Bradke, a student and participant in the Düsseldorf art scene. Viewers back in the ’60s could.\n\nWhile communism and its symbols continued to dominate in the east, cracks of resistance can be seen in the works of Bernhard Heisig, Wolfgang Mattheuer and Tübke. One can read a story of subtle opposition and courageous defiance in their efforts, a story that’s rarely been told in America.\n\nAnother revelation is the work of A.R. Penck. He is an East German artist born in Dresden who has utilized pictographs and simple forms to tell allegories about the divided nation and its torn psyche.\n\nPenck’s 1963 oil on canvas, “Der Übergang(Passage),” depicts a stick figure crossing a flaming tight rope. East Germany on one side, West Germany on the other – it’s easy to make that interpretation.\n\nCATCHING UP WITH HISTORY\n\nThe final section covering the 1980s is perhaps the least structured of all the sections. Historically, there’s a ton of territory to cover: postmodernism; issues of race, gender, sexuality and class; Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnostand perestroika; the dissolution of communism in Eastern Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The presence of the swastika in a number of works – often reversed, twisted or otherwise altered to avoid prosecution under German law – conveys the continuing legacy of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi catastrophe.\n\nThe strongest work in this section is Raffael Rheinsberg’s 1980 installation “Hand and Foot,” which consists of 400 shoes and gloves. They’re painted dark brown, and they evoke the violence and brutality of the Nazi regime. The shoes did in fact belong to forced laborers during World War II, and were found in a bombed-out train station in Berlin.\n\nOverall, “Art of Two Germanys” is a fascinating, enormous and edifying exhibition. It’s an intriguing, well-conceived look at the prodigious cultural production at the front lines of the Cold War. The only drawback is, it’s so extensive, it might take more than one visit to soak it all in."
