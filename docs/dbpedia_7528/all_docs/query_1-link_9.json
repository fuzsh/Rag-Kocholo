        "text": "BERLIN  East German art, like much of what used to be East Germany itself, hasn’t fared altogether well here since the Wall fell. Twenty years on, victorious Westerners, at least those old enough to remember the country divided, still tend to look with contempt on what passed for culture under Communism, as if the two, culture and Communism, were mutually exclusive. A curious hint of revenge sometimes creeps into their voices.\n\nCall it communal myopia. A recent article in Die Zeit, a German newsweekly, lamented how the new Moritzburg Museum in Halle shortchanges its own collection of East German paintings, one of the best in the country, “in a way that is almost shameful.” The article wondered whether the curators there weren’t maybe being a little parochial and spiteful, and afraid “to revise overly quick judgments made in the years after the reunification of Germany.” That meant above all the verdict that East German art, like the whole Communist era, would be best forgotten.\n\nYou have to travel some 6,000 miles at the moment to find a fresh and sympathetic view of postwar art on both sides of the Wall. “Art of Two Germanys,” which opened not long ago at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, mixes works from West and East, often in ways that blur the distinction. Organized by Stephanie Barron, a veteran curator at the Los Angeles museum, and by Eckhart Gillen, of Kulturprojekte Berlin, it’s another coup for this California institution, pulling together some 300 sculptures, paintings, drawings, photographs, videos and other objects made between the end of the war in 1945 and the fall of the Wall in 1989.\n\nThe show will head this way, to Nuremberg and then Berlin, in the spring; but it was instructive to see it there recently: to find all this heady, tortured, lugubrious German art amid the incongruous sunshine and palms, which somehow made the art stand out that much more distinctly. Never mind that the exhibition is installed in the museum’s new Broad building, probably Renzo Piano’s least distinctive museum design.\n\nAs for the story the show tells, West German art, so the standard account goes, flourished after the war thanks to free expression. Stars like Joseph Beuys, George Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer and Gerhard Richter had arrived on the world stage by the 1970s and established a new era of German cultural prestige abroad, while East German art languished under Communism, churning out only Socialist Realism.\n\nThe show makes clear that the truth was actually more complicated, as it usually is, East German art having been more varied, not always politically compliant, closer at times to what was happening in West Germany than the West German art establishment either acknowledged or bothered to notice.\n\nSmall assemblages by Hermann Glöckner, for example, should come as a revelation even to Germans. Glöckner, who died in 1987 at 98, concocted little sculptural gems in his studio, just for himself: elegant Constructivist improvisations, talismans of verboten modernism, made by folding, twisting and tying together discarded matchboxes, cut-up soap containers, tin pots, wood blocks and newspaper. Private acts of rebellion but also Proustian madeleines, lovingly put together from commonplace items in the East, they make much of what passed for abstract art on the other side of the Wall look labored and pretentious.\n\nGlöckner began working on his assemblages during the later 1950s, when photographers like Ursula Arnold and Arno Fischer were producing pictures of emergent socialism in street scenes whose frankness troubled East German authorities. Three decades later Maria Sewcz, Gundula Schulze Eldowy, Barbara Metselaar-Berthold and Sibylle Bergemann  all female photographers, not incidentally  dismantled and upset Communist dogma in various other ways. Photographs by all of these figures are in the show, and like Glöckner’s work they come largely as a discovery. Most notably Ms. Schulze Eldowy, a kind of German samizdat Diane Arbus, photographed an East Berlin postal worker named Lothar in his uniform on the street and then took a picture of him (this was apparently his idea) seated naked on his bed, a stoop-shouldered, unsmiling, skinny nudist, below a heaving shelf of liquor bottles in his miserable room. The pair of images, public and private, encapsulates the dual despair of ordinary life behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nAt the same time Ms. Metselaar-Berthold, East Germany’s version of Nan Goldin, captured scenes of disorderly bohemia (where supposedly none existed) in parties of topless women and pantless men. I was most struck by the Autoperforation Group in Dresden. It staged hours-long anarchic happenings in galleries and clubs (East Germans, if nothing else, had plenty of time to spare), during which the artists read texts about the death of the self, poked dead pigeons with sticks, wrapped their heads in bandages and spewed coal dust from vacuum cleaners.\n\nNever mind what it all meant. It was like much performance art in the West, which is to say, again, that the two Germanys weren’t always so far apart. Not that East Germany was a hotbed of undiscovered experimentation or that much of the art produced there was great. It wasn’t. But the show complicates matters, befitting reality, and situates postwar art on both sides of the Wall in a political context, which is the only logical approach to Germany.\n\nThat’s because German artists since the end of the war produced almost nothing that doesn’t struggle to cope with or to escape from History. During the 1940s this meant Richard Peter Sr.’s photographs from Dresden of corpses and ruins, a kind of vanquished art of gruesome poetry, and also Hans Grundig’s painted pieta to the victims of fascism, early evidence that what happened in the camps, where Grundig himself was imprisoned, was no mystery to Germans.\n\nIn retrospect Mr. Richter had next to nothing to do with Mr. Kiefer or Mr. Baselitz. And eccentrics like Dieter Roth were simultaneously contriving pastry carts loaded with pungent chocolate casts of lions, slowly putrefying, and others acts of mischievous confrontation. The show’s middle and later rooms are filled with all this different art, much of it familiar.\n\nIt’s heavy going, truth be told, and begs for a little revaluation. Some younger German critics today have begun to do just that  rethink the hierarchy of artists in the West. No doubt when the show comes over here, they’ll lay out their arguments.\n\nTo an American, meanwhile, those early postwar abstract painters (Ernst Wilhelm Nay, for one) look inventive, not escapist. On the other hand Mr. Kiefer, Mr. Baselitz and Beuys, in the name of confronting history, seem to have turned from anarchic acts of constructive mayhem, which usefully rattled complacent Germans at first, increasingly toward works about myth, mysticism and nature: grand themes that sometimes uncomfortably recalled Nazi motifs and diverted their production toward new forms of pompous escapism.\n\nThey’re diminished here, and artists like Glöckner get a boost, as the best shows tend to do. A final thought, speaking of evasion: It is perhaps no coincidence that Beuys, the great shaman of German art, a self-mythologizer who loved to recite the tale about having been a downed Luftwaffe pilot rescued by Tartar tribesmen and wrapped in animal fat and felt to help his wounds heal, never said how many people he bombed and killed before then for the Nazis."
