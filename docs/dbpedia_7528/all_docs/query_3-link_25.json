        "text": "Watch the video of this event HERE\n\nLecture featuring\n\nEckhart Gillen, Independent Curator based in Berlin, Germany\n\nModerated by Rachel Stern, Executive Director of the Fritz Ascher Society in New York\n\nThe lecture tells how the daughter of the Jewish clothing and furniture retailer Moritz Langer leaves her family’s Orthodox milieu to study at the Dresden Art Academy. There she meets art student Hans Grundig. With him she joined the German Communist Party in 1926. From now on she wanted to put her art at the service of the working class.\n\nAfter returning from exile in Palestine, she used her art for the newly founded GDR. There she had a career as a professor and as president of the Association of Fine Artists of the GDR. In this function, she unconditionally served the official art policy of the SED and also supported the “anti-Zionist” anti-Semitic policies of the GDR.\n\nBut the communist Lea Grundig is only one aspect of her life and work. The accusation of being a degenerate artist in the sense of Nazi terminology and the prohibition of pictures and memories of the genocide of the Jews became a test for the loyalty of the faithful communist and self-confident Jew Lea Grundig.\n\nEckhart Gillen, Art Historian, Independent Curator, born 1947 in Karlsruhe, Germany, based in Berlin. Study of art history, German and Sociology at the University of Heidelberg, where he received the Doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy. He has organized numerous exhibitions and published widely on Russian, American, and German art of thetwentieth century. Among his exhibition catalogs and books are „Amerika –Traum und Depression 1920/40“, Akademie der Künste, Berlin 1980; „German Art from Beckmann to Richter: Images of a Divided Country“; Yale University Press 1997; „Art of Two Germanys/Cold War Cultures 1945-1989“, LACMA, L.A., Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg, Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin 2009 (in collaboration with Stephanie Barron); „Feindliche Brüder? Der Kalte Krieg und die deutsche Kunst 1945-1989“, Berlin 2009; R.B.Kitaj – The Retrospective, 2012, Jewish Museum Berlin, Jewish Museum London and Hamburger Kunsthalle; Art in Europe 1945-1968: Facing the Future, BOZAR, Brussels, ZKM, Karlsruhe, Pushkin Museum, Moscow, 2016/17; „FLASHES OF THE FUTURE. The Art of the 68ers“, Ludwig Forum, Aachen, 2018; „Constructing the World. Art and Economy 1919 to 1939 in USA, Soviet Union and Germany“ in the Kunsthalle Mannheim, 2018/19.\n\nNumerous distinctions, including „einheitspreis – Bürgerpreis zur deutschen Einheit“ 2003 (bestowed by the Federal Agency for Civic Education), AICA-USA 2009 for Best Thematic Museum Show, and the Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge Award 2011 conferred by the foundation Preußische Seehandlung for unconventional art communication (together with Stefanie Barron). Adjunct professor for art history at the Film University in Potsdam-Babelsberg since 2011.\n\nThe event is part of our monthly series\n\nFlight or Fight. stories of artists under repression\n\nSponsored by Allianz Partners.\n\nImage: Lea Grundig, Discussion (in the Street) Between Workers Belonging to the KPD and the SPD [Diskussion (auf der Straße) zwischen KPD- und SPD-Arbeitern], 1930/31, Linocut, 10.8 x 14.4 inches [27,5 × 36,5 cm].
