        "text": "Hi all !\n\nI am new on this board. So let me introduce myself by submitting a writeup about my former main tuner - a Grundig Fine Arts T-9000. I currently use the updated version T-9009 (more on this one latter). I shall post owner and service manuals, brochures, photos and reviews (if that does not infringe any copyright policy).\n\nHope you will enjoy.\n\nThe T-9000 is probably the most remembered device from the celebrated Fine Arts range, Grundig's last high-end stand. This tuner was sold from 1987 to late 1991, when it was replaced by the updated T-9009. It retailed 1,800 DM in Germany and $1,200 in the US. Availability is more common in Europe than in the US.\n\nThe front-end is implemented with dual-gate MOS-FETs and is tuned by five varactor diodes (1 before the preamp, 2 before the mixer, 1 for the BJT-based Colpitts local oscillator and 1 for a tuned oscillator buffer). An automatic gain control circuit can bring in up to 40 dB of attenuation ahead of the preamp. Great care has been taken to shield the front-end in a completely closed metal box whose bottom plate is soldered to the main PCB ground plane, with additional jumper cables between the wall of the box and the metal chassis. Even the antenna socket and the coax output socket grounds are directly soldered on the walls of the shielded enclosure and the output of the front-end goes to the main PCB through a coaxial cable terminated with a coaxial plug. The front-end is driven by an elaborate frequency synthesizer based on two quartz crystals which is able to de-tune the center frequency to 12.5 kHz. The IF circuit consists of six stages of amplification implemented with discrete transistors and five Murata ceramic filters in-between (the first 4 filters having a -3 dB bandwidth of 230 kHz each and the last one 280 kHz). A wide mode implemented with an interesting switching circuit which controls the polarization of commutation diodes reduces the number of filters to three but leaves all six amplification stages in circuit, with a gain compensation to account the lesser filter losses. The detector is a PLL-type built around a Philips TDA1576 chip followed by a discrete birdie filter. The MPX PLL decoder is a Philips/Valvo TDA1578A. The service manual states that the chips used for T-9000s are selected for low distortion. The TDA1578A part number in the T-9000 service manual is indeed different than those of other Grundig tuners. Contrary to what is implied by D.A. Scott in his infamous 1993 Stereophile review, the US version does have a proper 75 Âµs de-emphasis circuit. The latter is implemented in the feedback loop of the TDA1578 output stage. The AF amp is a discrete design with BJT transistors following passive 19 and 38 kHz LC low-pass filters. A dedicated headphone amp based on a high output current RC4556 integrated operational amplifier is also provided. One of the most interesting aspects of this tuner is a completely separate high gain discrete amplifier solely dedicated to signal strength measurement. A microprocessor-controlled circuit had to learn in-factory the measuring steps with the help of a calibrated signal generator. A couple German magazines highly praised the accuracy of the signal strength meter, which shows an error no greater than 2 dB. The T-9000 was also the very first tuner to be able to demodulate the then newly developed RDS signal. Last but not least, the T-9000 is also an AM tuner, though no separate antenna socket is provided. Overall build quality is of a very high standard. The front-end PCB is made of a special FR4 material without fiber-glass especially developed for HF work. Apart from the front-end, the dual-quartz reference oscillator, the PLL detector and the signal-strength amplifier are placed in shielded enclosures which are not simple covers soldered onto the PCB, but are made of metal side walls going through the PCB with metal covers at the component side as well as the solder side. The microprocessor board is a dual sided PCB with a complete ground plane on one side and is mounted on a vertical metal frame for shielding. High grade components are used, from the high quality dual C-Core power transformer to the electrolytic capacitors in the refined regulated power supplies and elsewhere. Highly stable 3% tolerated polystyrene capacitors are found, notably in the de-emphasis and AF output filters. For ease of serviceability, the bottom plate is removable to give a unobstructed access to the solder side of the main PCB. Wood side panels enhance the effect of the lavish black aluminum front panel.\n\nAs far as I'm concern, the T-9000 is a triumph of ergonomics. The preset stations and numerous functions are controlled by very well laid out big push-buttons. RDS data, station frequency or direct actual RF signal strength in dBf can be alternately displayed on a very big, hence highly readable, matrix dot screen. Permanently displayed are the currently tuned station memory number, a bar-graph signal strength indicator, wide/narrow and center frequency indicator and status function. Features include 29 presets, a REC CAL 400 Hz tone signal generator calibrated at 40 kHz deviation, continuously adjustable threshold level for the automatic search tuning and four timer memories to be used with an external timer on/off device. There are a variable audio output with its control knob at the back of the unit and at the front, an additional fixed level audio output and the headphone jack socket with its separate volume control. All RCA sockets are gold-plated. The RDS functions include the automatic scanning of the entire FM spectrum in search of RDS emissions and alternate frequency search for each RDS station. Non-RDS FM radio stations and AM stations can be designated by a name display manually programed intro the computer. Tuning can be automatic or manual, as well as commutation on mono, fine tuning, AGC enable/disable and wide/narrow setting. Beware the antenna input is a single 75 ohms IEC connector. AM tuning is switchable between 9 and 10 kHz spacing at start-up. Where I live in the countryside, at the flank of a small valley, not far from the top, with a simple omnidirectional antenna on the roof, the T-9000 do give me the best reception of my most beloved, yet difficult to receive, classical music FM radio station of two other renown tuners I used to use : a Denon TU-S10 and a Yamaha T-2. The sound is distinctly more free of noise and distortion compared to those even with a week signal, with surprisingly full-bodied bass. Overall, the sound is crisp and mellow, with very little difference between wide and narrow mode (which confirms measurements of published reviews), and very good stereo separation.\n\nCheers."
