        "text": "BERLIN â€” East German art, like much of what used to be East Germany itself, hasn't fared altogether well here since the Wall fell. Twenty years on, victorious Westerners, at least those old enough to remember the country divided, still tend to look with contempt on what passed for culture under Communism, as if the two, culture and Communism, were mutually exclusive. A curious hint of revenge sometimes creeps into their voices.\n\nCall it communal myopia. A recent article in the German weekly Die Zeit lamented how the new Moritzburg Museum in Halle shortchanges its own collection of East German paintings, one of the best in the country, \"in a way that is almost shameful.\" The article wondered whether the curators there were afraid \"to revise overly quick judgments made in the years after the reunification of Germany.\" That meant above all the verdict that East German art, like the whole Communist era, would be best forgotten.\n\nYou have to travel some 9,600 kilometers, or 6,000 miles, at the moment to find a fresh and sympathetic view of postwar art on both sides of the Wall. \"Art of Two Germanys,\" which opened not long ago at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, mixes works from West and East, often in ways that blur the distinction. Organized by Stephanie Barron, a veteran curator at the Los Angeles museum, and by Eckhart Gillen, of Kulturprojekte Berlin, it's another coup for this California institution, pulling together some 300 sculptures, paintings, drawings, photographs, videos and other objects made between the end of the war in 1945 and the fall of the Wall in 1989.\n\nThe show will head this way, to Nuremberg and then Berlin, in the spring; but it was instructive to see it there recently: to find all this heady, tortured, lugubrious German art amid the incongruous sunshine and palms, which somehow made the art stand out that much more distinctly."
