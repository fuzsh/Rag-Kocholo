        "text": "THE CAUSE of a fire that saw a Millbrook mill demolished remains undisclosed, despite being treated as arson.\n\nThe derelict structure on Grove Road, which was last home to the Atlas Rubber Mouldings company, was pulled down after the blaze broke out in the early hours of Thursday, April 15.\n\nSeveral theories have been bandied about as to why the building was targeted but police and fire officials remain in a joint investigation.\n\nThe three-storey mill, which had stood empty for more than 20 years, was already well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.\n\nSix Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) crews attended, with water being pumped from the nearby Huddersfield Narrow Canal.\n\nPeople living nearby were told to keep their windows and doors closed as smoke billowed over the area.\n\nAnd at the time, Greater Manchester Police said it was treating the fire as arson.\n\nA statement said: “Police were called to reports of a fire at a derelict mill on Grove Road in Millbrook.\n\n“Emergency services attended and a joint investigation is ongoing with the fire service to establish the full circumstances of the fire which is currently being treated as arson.\n\n“There are no injuries and no arrests have been made.”\n\nGMFRS added: “The fire involved a derelict three-storey mill approximately 40 square metres in size.\n\n“The building was well alight when crews arrived and generating a significant smoke plume, and firefighters deployed ground monitors and aerial platforms to extinguish the blaze.”"
