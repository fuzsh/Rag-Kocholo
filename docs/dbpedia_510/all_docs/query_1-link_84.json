        "text": "COEUR d’ALENE — A soil swap between Coeur d’Alene and ignite cda is expected to close a city pedestrian trail for about two months.\n\nThe section of the Atlas Trail is parallel to Atlas Road and just north of Interstate 90. The project is expected to begin soon.\n\n“It is a big deal to close a trail like that,” said Councilwoman Christie Wood. “I’m a trail user. I see thousands of people on the trail and they rely on the trail.”\n\nThe Coeur d’Alene City Council recently approved a transfer of structural fill material from city property on Atlas Road north of and adjacent to Interstate 90 to ignite cda, its urban renewal agency, in exchange for unsuitable soils from the former Atlas Mill site, known as “Mt. Hink.”\n\nThe land is targeted for Phase 3 of the 70-acre Atlas Waterfront development facing the Spokane River, which includes a mix of homes and townhouses, starting at more than $1 million.\n\n“So we’ll bring in some of the good stuff. We’ll kind of mix it with some of the better, bad stuff to recreate buildable materials on the site,” said Tony Berns, ignite cda executive director.\n\nThe initial proposal called for removing about 75,000 cubic yards of bark, sawdust and other debris left over from decades of the mill operation and backhauling 60,000 cubic yards of healthy dirt.\n\nBerns said at a recent ignite cda board meeting the numbers have changed, to 64,000 cubic yards of contaminated solid going out from Mt. Hink, and 20,000 cubic yards of good stuff coming back to be “blended” with the soil on site.\n\n\"Our goal right now is to get it developable,\" Berns said.\n\nIgnite cda will cover costs associated with the excavating and hauling, estimated at about $2 million. LaRiviere Construction will handle the job.\n\nThe Idaho Transportation Department previously transferred the parcel of property on Atlas Road to the city for a possible well site.\n\n“After a test well was drilled, the Water Department determined that the property was not viable for a groundwater well,” a city report said.\n\nThe city agreed to transfer the property back to the state for use as a stormwater infiltration pond as part of its I-90 expansion project.\n\nThe “Mt. Hink” soil is suitable for a stormwater infiltration pond and ignite cda will finish grading the swale site to ITD’s desired configuration, the city report said.\n\nTo make the dirt deal work, some Ponderosa pines will be removed and a section of Atlas Trail will be closed.\n\n“I’m not thinking we’re going to be able to keep that trail open,” said Troy Tymesen, city of Coeur d’Alene administrator.\n\n\"There’s going to be a lot of moving equipment and we don’t want anyone to get hurt,” he added.\n\nThe city and ignite cda want to get started ahead of the summer season.\n\n“The goal is to get in, get this going and get this done,” Tymesen said.\n\nWood questioned the trail closure and asked Tymesen if he had an alternate route in mind for its users. He said no and suggested cyclists and pedestrians find another way to connect with Seltice Way.\n\n“Citizens rely on that trail every day,” Wood said, adding that she understood the need for the project and agreed it needed to be done.\n\n“The timing is terrible,” Wood said.\n\nCouncilman Dan Gookin wasn’t a fan and didn’t like closing a city path.\n\n“My opinion is, this is just dumb,” he said.\n\n“We’re giving away dirt. Dirt has a price,\" Gookin said.\n\nHe said millions have been spent trying to remediate and remove soil under Mt. Hink \"making it the most expensive property in Kootenai County.\n\n“To me, this is just colossal government stupidity,” he said.\n\n“Ignite has dug themselves a hole and they’re trying to dig themselves out.”\n\nPhil Boyd, president of Welch-Comer Engineering, said they can have the trail back open and any repairs made by July 1 to meet a City Council condition. The project should be wrapped up by late July."
