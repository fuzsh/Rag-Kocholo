        "text": "The City of Coeur d'Alene purchased nearly 47 acres of Spokane River waterfront property that was the former Atlas Mill site in 2018 with the goal of creating permanent, public waterfront access and encouraging economic development initiatives on the site. The City purchased the property for $7,850,000 and the sale was recorded on May 16, 2018, making the sale official. The City began the process of purchasing the Atlas Waterfront property in May of 2017. The project size was increased to approximately 70 acres by including a triangle parcel that was acquired through a land exchange and vacating un-used road right-of-way along the south side of Seltice Way.\n\nThe City of Coeur d'Alene is working in partnership with ignite CDA and the project management team from Welch Comer and Heartland LLC to develop the property. The project is currently in the second phase of development, which includes Areas 1, 2, 5B, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Construction is underway in Areas 1, 2 and 6 currently. The public open space and Atlas Park are open for use. Atlas Park and the public open space can currently be accessed from Suzanne Road (through Riverstone) for vehicular traffic and can be accessed from Riverstone Park for pedestrians, bikes and other non-motorized users. The public open space is approximately 24.5 acres with 3,780 linear feet of beautiful public shoreline along the Spokane River.\n\nThe Planning Commission approved the Planned Unit Development and Preliminary Plat for the Atlas Waterfront Project at their November 12, 2019 meeting.

There was a second PUD amendment in February 2021. A third PUD amendment as approved in March 2022.\n\nThe approved Development Standards for the project are available at the link below.
