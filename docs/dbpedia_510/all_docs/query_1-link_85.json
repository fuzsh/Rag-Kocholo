The Atlas V rocket has launched 90 times with payloads for the Department of Defense, NASA and commercial customers.\n\n“I had the opportunity to visit Wichita recently and meet with current and potential suppliers,” said Tory Bruno, ULA president and CEO. “During my time there I was very impressed with the highly skilled workforce and aerospace industry knowledge that already exists. As we continue our support to the nation as its premier launch services provider, we looking forward to working with Milling Precision to deliver those critical missions.”\n\nMilling Precision will be adding to ULA’s diverse network of suppliers providing fabricated and machined parts. Their talented and committed workforce will add to ULA’s first in class launch and schedule capability meeting our customers’ needs and ULA’s best value.\n\nULA is no stranger to the tremendous aerospace suppliers of the great state of Kansas.
