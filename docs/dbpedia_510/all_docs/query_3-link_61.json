        "text": "Metso provides all required hardware for grinding equipment assembly and operation. Large grinding equipment is typically split into multiple segments or cans to make their manufacturing and transport to a mine site feasible. The hardware to join these components consists of specialized bolts, nuts, washers, spacers, lubrication, torque wrenches and instrumentation, torque and elongation measuring equipment.\n\nThere are three categories of specialized hardware used in grinding mills:\n\nStatic bolts: Non-rotating bolts such as anchor bolts, bearing assembly bolts, etc.\n\nRotating bolts: Bolts that go through fatigue loading making their design and installation of utmost importance. Examples of these bolts include head-to-trunnion, head-to-head, head-to-shell, head-to-shell-to-gear, shell-to-shell, gear-to-gear, trunnion liner-to-trunnion, trommel-to-trunnion liner, etc.\n\nLiner bolts: Bolts that rotate with the mill and function to attach mill liners to the grinding mill head and shell.\n\nCritical fasteners\n\nFastening hardware such as bolts or studs used to secure mill structural components together must withstand the harsh forces of grinding mill operations. If a fastener failure occurs, a lack of spare components on site can make matters worse.\n\nAs an OEM, Metso has designed grinding mills for over 100 years. We know the importance of critical fastener applications and operating loads. When a hardware component fails, we stock various fastener sizes to minimize downtime and replenish critical parts when you need them most.\n\nRead more >\n\nHigh-quality hardware\n\nHardware ordered through Metso is of highest quality as every hardware order is accompanied by a proprietary Metso manufacturing and shipping specification. These specifications ensure that each bolt-nut-washer set is manufactured, quality checked and tested to requirements specified by our engineering professionals. They also ensure that hardware is packed and protected appropriately to avoid damage during transport.\n\nHardware can also be ordered with internal instrumentation. This helps to speed up bolt torqueing and mill assembly, and facilitate the verification of bolt preloads at specific intervals during the life of the mill.\n\nLabratory testing\n\nBolt breakage may happen during mill operation due to mill overloads such as dropped-charge, use of defective or inferior bolts, contamination of mill flanges with slurry that causes bolt overloads, or improper installation resulting in bolt loosening. In such cases, Metso can provide laboratory testing of the broken bolts and make a root cause analysis.\n\nTurn-key services\n\nMetso also provides turn-key services to remove broken bolts from threaded flanges and install replacement bolts. These services are fully supported with engineering.\n\nWhen assembling a new mill or planning a major upgrade or refurbishment to an existing mill, getting input from a partner with OEM experience can make all the difference. It can help ensure each component of your mill from the gears and pinions to the last bolt in order to produce the results you need."
