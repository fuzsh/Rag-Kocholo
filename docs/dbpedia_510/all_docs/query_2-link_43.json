        "text": "I never realized that Atlas was considered a hobbyist level brand?\n\nAbout 40 years ago, at my first real job we had a very large, slightly strange shop press that had the Atlas Press Company logo on it.\n\nIt was rated something like 150 tons and had three press sections. The main frame of the press was huge, over 8ft long and over 7ft tall.\n\nThe middle had a manual or air powered hydraulic ram but unlike most modern presses, this thing had a threaded ram.\n\nThere was a huge cast iron wheel near the top, just below the main beam. The wheel was at least 24\" in diameter and resembled a 1 1/2\" thick cast iron steering wheel of sorts.\n\nIt could be used with or without air. To apply pressure you would pull down on a long lever till you heard it click or ratchet. There was a 6\" pressure gauge on top as well. One each end of the main table were manual gear driven arbor presses, one large, one smaller.\n\nThe table was raised and lowered with a gear tooth rack and a crank which turned a shaft, to a transmission, which rotated a driven gear which lifted or lowered the table.\n\nWhen the place closed we all called dibs on the equipment, I took the brake lathes, air compressors, and the smaller press. I was going to take the Atlas press but I just didn't have a place to put it then. I wish I had it now.\n\nI was told at the time that it was original to the dealership who opened its doors in 1928 selling tractors and Ford trucks.\n\nAtlas also changed its name to Clausing in the 1960's, which is a well respected brand even today.\n\nBack in high school I worked on weekends at a place that built wooden shipping crates, their main cabinet saw was made by Atlas Press Co. It had the same logo and name plate as the contractors saw I have from the early 50's. That saw ran 7 days a week for decades. I was told that it was bought new in the late 40's when the owner's father came back from the war and started the business. It ran on three phase power.\n\nThey also had two huge radial arm saws, one was a huge Atlas saw, the other was Dewalt. The two saws were nearly identical other than the branding. The Dewalt was dated 1959, the Atlas info was worn off.\n\nThe two RAS were set up along two conveyor lines, wood coming from the supply room would get directed to the saws, each which had been set up with work stops to make repeated cuts. Two guys ran those saws all day. I seem to think the blades were 20 inch or more, I have one or two of the old blades around here somewhere. Each radial arm saw would make enough sawdust each day to fill a medium sized dump truck. One of my jobs was to keep those trucks empty. (they had three dump trucks, one was to always be under the dust chute so I'd switch out the trucks, and go empty the full one). Every so often I'd get paid to haul a trailer load of sealed bags of sawdust to a lumber company. They would bag the sawdust and fill a 45ft trailer with it every few days. In the past, they had just let the sawdust pile up but got complaints from the neighbors and the fire marshal.\n\nI wouldn't consider either of those machines hobbyist level machines.\n\nThe OP landed on a nice little machine for the garage shop. Decently built, small footprint, and better castings than any of the newer imports. Hope it serves you well, congratulations.\n\nWhy don't they allow Atlas machines on that forum?\n\n-Very OT so skip this if you don't want to read it: Others have already mentioned that it's a site for the professionals engaged in commercial ventures. What hasn't been mentioned is the sheer volume of posts from people too lazy to do research into their own questions, sometimes from college students wanting somebody to supply the bulk of information for their assignments so they can do a cut-n-paste. Other posts can/will be from people contemplating machines or machining operations so far beyond their capability that it's absurd to even consider or dangerous to continue. Once again, a little homework would have told them so but they can't be bothered to do anything but ask others to supply answers for them. Posts of this nature would clog the bandwidth on a daily basis and the members/owners/moderators prefer to keep the website tidy and free from clutter. It happens on this site too.\n\nGenuine interest and questions from beginners that have done previous research are seldom run off. Any of the members criticizing an earnest beginner are chastised by the rest of us and reminded that we were all once beginners. For any that have questions, do your homework and state what you've found before posting your questions. Light duty, hobby grade machines are not what professionals use for several reasons. If you want professional advice, use the equipment and the methods professionals use. It's not about elitism.\n\nThe \"forbidden\" machines themselves are a bit iffy. Some machines that can still be used in commercial ventures aren't favored. Shapers used to be a machine commonly found in professional shops but have largely fallen out of favor for the last 80 years and were going to be banned but were instead relegated to the \"antique\" forum after some protest by members that still used them for internal keyways. Older machines have their own forum for the same reasons. The inexpensive, imported machines from China that have flooded the market are generally of very poor quality and that's why they aren't used by professionals. Many of the professionals have one or two of these (yes....even me) hiding but see occasional use. Machinery like Atlas, Logan, and South Bend are considered hobby grade and always have been, even when new. All of them have made departure designs when trying to offer professional grade machinery.\n\nJust because it's a hobby grade or light duty doesn't mean it's useless for good quality work, you just have to be mindful of the audience you mention it with. The website PM has a wealth of information in it, reading is better than posting if you're a beginner.\n\nAtlas also changed its name to Clausing in the 1960's, which is a well respected brand even today.\n\nAtlas has a long history, and started out making presses (as the Atlas Press Company), so that massive press may have been one of their earlier products. They later made their mark selling affordable woodworking and machine tools frequently partnering with Sears.\n\nAtlas essentially held a position similar to the \"Chinese\" machine tool makers today. They bought Clausing in the 1960s and eventually took the Clausing name which was held in higher regard than Atlas was.\n\nWhen a company takes the name of the product line they bought out, that tells you something about how the company is looked at.\n\nAtlas tools are not terrible, and perfectly fine for home shop and light industrial work, but they were among the cheapest machine tools available in their day. Sears sold the Atlas (Craftsman) 12x36\" with QCGB and cabinet for $650 in 1963. A South Bend 10-k aka \"light 10\" 10x34\" lathe with QCGB, sold for $864. The Craftsman 12x36 had a shipping weight of 545lbs vs the \"smaller\" South Bend's 755lbs.\n\nI think the Atlas machines are actually quite nice for what they are and in many cases they offer more user friendly features than more industrial machines, likely because their target market was lesser skilled hobbyists and collateral duty machinists. You can also see where they cut costs though too, with their cheaper materials, flat ways etc."
