        "text": "The original M1-61 Support Bar was made in one piece of cast iron. After the two clamping screw holes were drilled, reamed and tapped, the saddle bar was sawed off with a 1/8\" thick slitting saw.\n\nComments on using or looking for anything in Downloads -\n\nFirst, read the instructions in the Sticky Area at the top of this forum.\n\nBecause the Xenforo RESOURCES module, which was modified by the List Owner for use as a file DOWNLOADS module, has absolutely no sort capability, and the fact that there are nearly 2000 files currently in the system, and about 10% are Atlas, I created a lot of Categories (Folders or Directories and Sub-Directories) and in most cases was able in the lowest sub-directories to limit the page counts to 1. So you should never have to search more than one page of files. But before you start looking at file names in the right pane, first drill down to the lowest sub-directory or folder or category. Which in the current case is Atlas Mill Drawings.\n\nI apologize for forgetting to put the Atlas part number (M1-61) into the Title. I just fixed that. And I also somehow on the same day uploaded two copies of the same drawing. I just fixed that, too.\n\nFinally, if your mill wasn't originally a \"C\" model (MFC, etc.), there are three other parts (M1-60. M1-66 and M1-67) that you will have to make before you can use the support bar. I have the factory drawings for those and will upload them in a day or two. The reason that I haven't already is probably because when I got the drawings from Clausing, the M1-61 drawing was absolutely terrible. And I got bogged down in trying to clean it up, got tired of working on it for a while, and forgot to upload the other drawings.\n\nI don't know who drew the drawing that is in Downloads. I have not checked his dimensions against the factory drawing because at the moment, they are illegible."
