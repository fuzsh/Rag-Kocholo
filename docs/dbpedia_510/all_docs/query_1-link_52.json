        "text": "Atlas Lab is leading the redevelopment of Mill Street in the heart of Historic Downtown Grass Valley from vehicular street to pedestrian plaza. Following the success of the temporary closure of two blocks of Mill Street to create public space in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Atlas was contracted to lead the permanent transformation of Mill Street. The goal of the project is to support local businesses and community activities while welcoming visitors to experience the Heart of Grass Valley in a unique and historical setting. Tasked to master plan improvements at the Downtown district scale and develop contract drawings, Atlas managed and led a multi-disciplinary including transportation planning, civil and architecture. Atlas Lab’s scope also included stakeholder and community engagement.\n\nTo address current accessibility goals, streetscape improvements include conversion of traditional curb and gutter to flush curb condition along with improvements to adjacent street intersections. Custom planters, site furnishings and seating areas are carefully positioned throughout the street to 1) provide necessary vegetation and shading currently lacking on the street, 2) support businesses activities and 3) provide designated public seating area to create a cohesive identity that compliments the historic character while supporting 21st century needs.\n\nabout the project\n\nAtlas Lab is leading the redevelopment of Mill Street in the heart of Historic Downtown Grass Valley from vehicular street to pedestrian plaza.
