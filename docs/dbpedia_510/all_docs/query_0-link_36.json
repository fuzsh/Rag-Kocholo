        "text": "Donor, Mrs Alice Griffin, nee Corkerton was born in January 1922 at 70 Union Street, Ashton. Her father, Charles William Corkerton was born in 1890 in Small Shaw Lane, Ashton, and was a minder (cotton) in Cedar Mill. He had married Alice, nee Hodge who came from Dukinfield and who also worked in Cedar Mill. Donor had one brother and one sister: Edith, who was born in 1916. She went to train as a nurse in Blackburn during the 2nd World War and married Mr Gorton there; Eric, born in 1920. He went to work for a firm in Berkshire\n\nDonor went to St James School, Ashton. She left at 14 and her first job was with Aeriolite (?) - making batteries, in Ashton. The firm has now moved to Stalybridge. Because the hours were so long (till 8 o'clock at night) she went to work in Atlas Mill where her mother's brother was an under-carder. She stayed there until she was seventeen when she left because they all had to \"work a week and stop a week\". She was then at Horrocks Colour Printers, cutting out boxes etc. When she was about 19 she was with a handbag company at Hathershaw and earned Â£3 pw + bonus. During the 2nd World War she was in the Land Army.\n\nDonor met her husband through cousins (father's side) who lived at Brierley, near Barnsley. He is called Stanley Griffin and was born in 1920 at Havercroft. All his family worked in the mines - as he did as soon as he could leave school. He had two brothers, Colin and John (also miners). His father, John Griffin, had come to Yorkshire as a child. His father walked from London to Yorkshire to find work, and when he had found it, went back to collect his family. Donor married Stanley in 1947 and they have two children, Gloria Jean b. 1948 and Elsie b. 1951, who now lives in Australia."
