        "text": "Their design ensures maximum machining accuracy and high productivity, with great stability during operations. As all Innse-Berardi machines, also the Atlas Hydro machines are designed, sized and created using the FEM (Finite Element Method). The flexible, modular design offers three different configurations:\n\nP Planomiller type - fixed portal\n\nG Gantry type - lower rails\n\nGU Gantry type - upper rails\n\nA complete range of advanced milling attachments provides the optimum solution for each userâ€™s application requirements.\n\nTechnical specifications:\n\nDistance between columns mm 3,200 up to 10,000 RAM vertical travel (Z-axis) mm 1,500 up to 4,000 RAM section mm 550 x 550 - 630 x 630 - 680 x 680 Spindle power kW 60 up to 110 Torque Nm up to 9,000 Axis 3+2 or 5 W-axis fixed or moving crossrail\n\nVertical turning tables\n\nBoth, Atlas Vision as well as Atlas Hydro can be equipped optionally with Turning Tables for Turning, Boring, Milling, Turn-Milling and Grinding. The full range is featuring hydrostatic main bearings.\n\nA complete range of advanced attachments provides the optimum solution for the different application requirements.\n\nThe modular design covers a broad range of different sizes:"
