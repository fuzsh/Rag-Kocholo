        "text": "FAIRHAVEN — The ghostly remains of the Atlas Tack factory off Pleasant Street continue to haunt town officials who remain locked in a game called “Who wants to tear down a building?”\n\nIt’s a game where the winner doesn’t get any money, but, instead, may have to shell out a lot of cash.\n\nThe Atlas Tack factory was built in 1901 and was the world’s largest producer of wire tacks, bolts, shoe eyelets, bottle caps, and other small hardware. It was the town’s largest employer. It closed in 1985 and was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s list for Superfund sites in 1990. The cleanup took place between June 2005 and September 2007.\n\nAnd then the cleanup was done.\n\nWait. Not so fast.\n\nThe gigantic manufacturing building, 80-foot-high smokestack, boiler plant, and the machinery garage were all torn down and hauled off the property. However, the long, rectangular brick office building still stands out front – sort of.\n\nFor over three decades, trees, brush and weeds have grown up around its brick skeletal remains and on the inside of its debris-strewn belly exposed by the caved-in roof. The rest of the 13-acre parcel sits quietly, still recovering from being gouged out during the hazardous waste cleanup process.\n\n“The problem for anybody is the cost of knocking it down,” said Attorney Thomas Crotty, Fairhaven town counsel, about the remaining building.\n\nThe owner of the property is listed as Atlas Tack Corporation in care of Great Northern Industries, with an address of 266 Beacon St. in Boston. The principal is listed as M. Leonard Lewis, who seems to be a bit of a phantom as letters from the EPA to him have gone without a response.\n\nCalls to Great Northern Industries by a Standard-Times reporter were answered by voicemail and weren't returned.\n\nWhen Atlas Tack was new\n\nOn Thursday, May 8, 1902, the “immense new mill of the Atlas Tack Co was dedicated...with a grand ball which was attended by nearly a thousand people,” read the article in the Fairhaven Star newspaper. The new factory replaced its predecessor American Tack Company on Fort Street. A grand march was led by George W. Weymouth, president and manager of Atlas Tack. The gala event featured dancing and refreshments. Other rooms were reserved for “card playing, smoking and cloak rooms.”\n\nHenry Huttleston Rogers, a Standard Oil millionaire, built the Atlas Tack factory. According to historical accounts, it employed anywhere from 300 to 700 workers over its decades in Fairhaven. The company witnessed several strikes from workers asking for higher wages and a reduction of long workday hours. Workers walked out once because of excessive heat conditions in the building.\n\nIn 1963, Atlas Tack ratified a union agreement with Local 899 of the United Auto Workers Union.\n\nA drowning tragedy\n\nThe lagoon at the rear of the Atlas Tack property was the scene of a drowning in January 1947 when Robert A. Sylvia, age 10, fell through the ice on the pond. Leo Meekin, a 12-year-old boy with him at the time, tried to rescue Sylvia by crawling out onto the ice and also ended up falling through the ice. James Kennedy, 9, ran to a nearby house and police were summoned. Meekin was rescued. Sylvia was eventually pulled from the water but attempts to revive him were not successful.\n\nChemicals ended up in the lagoon\n\nAccording to an EPA report, cyanide and heavy metals were discharged from the 1940s and over the next four decades into the unlined acid-neutralizing lagoon about 200 feet east of the manufacturing building and adjacent to a saltwater tidal marsh in Buzzards Bay Estuary. Process waste containing acids, metals such as copper and nickel and solvents were discharged into drains in the floor of the main building. Some of these chemicals permeated the floors and timbers of the building and migrated to adjacent soils and groundwater. Other contaminated areas at the site included a filled wetland, a former dump, and other chemical spills.\n\n1985: A factory closes, trouble begins\n\nThe business had been slowing down since the 1970s and some of the equipment was being sold off. In 1985 the machines went silent, employees went home never to return, and the business closed. Mary Reed was featured in a video documentary by M.L. Baron in 1987 and recounted her days as a clerk at Atlas Tack. Her parents as well as her husband and her brothers all worked there. “They offered me a job for 22-cents an hour,” she said. She worked at the factory until 1971 when she retired. “The bad part was, we lost our pension. We lost our medical. And we lost our life insurance when they locked up three years ago. We lost everything,” she said in the documentary. She remembered the days of clambakes, holiday parties, outings, fall dances. “It was like a big family,” she said.\n\n\"It was a great place to work before Mr. (M. Leonard) Lewis and Mr. (Richard) Secor took it over...these fellas took it over and everything went down the drain,\" Reed said.\n\nA visit from Barney Frank and Edward Kennedy\n\nIn May 2004, Rep. Barney Frank, Sen. Edward Kennedy, and the head of the federal EPA inspected the Atlas Tack property and to announce an additional $1.8 million toward the estimated $20 million to remove buildings and clean out the hazardous waste of the site.\n\nEPA cleanup: 2005-2007\n\nThe site cleanup by the EPA included demolition of the manufacturing and power plant buildings and excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil and sludge beneath the buildings in the commercial area, along with excavation of contaminated soils and debris in the debris and fill areas, and, finally, excavation of marsh soils and creek bed sediments. Cleanup took place between June 2005 and September 2007 removing buildings and some 108,000 tons of contaminated soil, debris and sediment.\n\nA stalemate begins\n\nThe Atlas Tack property owner seems to have gone radio silent since a court ordered it to pay fines equal to the fair market value of the property to the town, EPA and DEP, regardless of whether it intends on selling or keeping the land. The town was entitled to as much as $80,000 under this agreement. Atlas Tack was given 30-days to respond to the EPA’s requests back in 2019 for an appraisal and decision on keeping the property. Atlas Tack didn’t respond at all.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\n“Now the town can foreclose,” said Crotty. However, he said town officials are apprehensive about doing that because it will likely cost more money than the property is worth. The town currently assesses the property at $159,400. And since the EPA has set limits on what can be done with the site, the town doesn’t want to be stuck with a lemon. Crotty said the board recently sought an opinion from Attorney Michelle O’Brien, an environmental lawyer with Pierce Atwood, LLP in Boston.\n\nCrotty said the board received the opinion from O’Brien, but would not disclose the details until the board addresses it at a public meeting.\n\nChairman Robert Espindola said the board will meet on Oct. 12, and he plans to ask that the opinion be discussed in closed session. If it does not meet Open Meeting Law criteria to be discussed privately, he said the board will discuss the matter in open session.\n\nEspindola said he'd like to see the building demolished to remove the eyesore and possible danger to the community.\n\n\"I'd like to see it put back on the town's tax rolls,\" he said regarding his personal preference. \"I'd like to see it developed to something useful to the community.\""
