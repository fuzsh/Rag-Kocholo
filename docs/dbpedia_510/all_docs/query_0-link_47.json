        "text": "Photo-silverpixel\n\nAccording to Wikipedia and other archives I researched yesterday; the first settler in Ashton was listed as John Sumner. This morning on the LCGS Facebook page– Jim Amy Kirkpatrick said that\n\nWell, John Sumner became a merchant and chose to be near the Goodwood River, (now known as the Jock River) which gave the village the power it needed to establish a mill. Every single other town had a mill, so why shouldn’t Ashton?\n\nThe village’s former name was Mount Pleasant or Sumner’s Corners (after John Sumner) (c1840) and an outlet was established for mail in the area, but the post office did not officially open until July 6, 1851. I guess in that era you could have any job you choose and Sumner decided to become the postmaster.\n\nSumner was instrumental in naming the settlement, and there are two schools of thought regarding the same name. One group says Sumner named Ashton after his ancestral home at Ashton-under-Lyne in England, and the opposing group says it was so named because of his successful pot ashery establishment.\n\nThe Historical Atlas of Carleton County of 1879 refers to Ashton as ‘a smart little country village with many encouraging evidence of material prosperity and healthy improvement surrounded by many fair farms and not just a few fine ones’.\n\nAfter 15 years of Sumner residing there, the village had reached 100 in population, with a few churches, and a school with an average attendance of about 40 pupils. The Jock river’s name was changed after a Frenchman named Jacques drowned in that very same river in the early 19th century.\n\nAs I searched the newspaper archives I noticed there were few Ashton social notes in the Almonte Gazette or the Perth Courier. Sure there were births and deaths, but that was about it. I wondered why no one was reporting about socials and then figured no one had the time to do it- or maybe they were just content without having to blast something across the county.\n\nIn 1950– 115 acres of land was going for $5000 according to the Ottawa Journal. In the 70s the Ashton Feed Mill had a flea market and auction hall and Gerald Lepage was the auctioneer. A teacher could make herself a fine $1500 a year in 1954 teaching the local kids in SS #5 in Munster.\n\nI did find something amusing in the March 22, 1969 Arizona Star that Richard Kidd from Ashton, Ontario won a World Book Atlas, but I am not upgrading my newspaper archives service to $19.99 a month to find out the details– so you can ask him personally. Or, was there another Richard Kidd in the area?\n\nwww.mcelroy.ca—William McElroy watering his horse (and buggy) in the Jock River\n\nReg Delahunt from Ashton -Old Canadian Newspaper files- Carleton Place and Beckwith Heritage Museum\n\nMrs. Lorne Robinson wins big bucks from CKOY\n\nFrom Fuller’s Directory for 1866 and 1867\n\nAshton possesses a water power, and contains Episcopalian and Presbyterian Churches.
