        "text": "HSS are stronger and weigh less than many comparable sections, making them an efficient choice when it’s important to minimize weight and project time. They’re a cost-effective alternative to open sections and built-up, welded box sections, and their smaller surface area make painting and clean-up a cinch.\n\nBig buildings need big tools — tools like Atlas Tube Jumbo HSS, the largest HSS made in North America. Designed to support the longest spans and most extreme loads, jumbo HSS offer unmatched structural efficiency, giving you impressive savings on weight and construction time compared to wide-flange sections. So start making big plans today. Atlas Tube is ready to help you build.\n\nLearn more"
