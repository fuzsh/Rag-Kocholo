        "text": "Marker Text In 1856 Archibald F. Leonard (1816-1876) built a dam and grain mill at this site. Hiram Crowley became a partner. The mill became a community center and county voting place. During widespread abolition violence in 1860, Leonard's Mill was burned. It reopened by 1862 and operated during the Civil War. Owners after 1867 were H.B. Alverson and J.H. Wheeler. In 1876 R.A. (Bob) Randol (1850-1922) acquired Wheeler's Mill. A water-driven turbine powered the mill, a circular saw,and a cotton gin. Randol Mill played an important role in the area economy and closed after Randol's death. (1979)"
