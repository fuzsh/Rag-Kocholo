        "text": "At SKRM we have three plants of which one is a structure mill producing hot rolled structural items. The second plant is a TMT mill producing TMT bars and the third plant is a Steel Melting Shop producing Pencil Ingots.\n\nSKRM has a semi automatic cross country type structure mill. SKRM produces hot rolled special profiles, angles, flats and rounds for various industries in automotive, engineering and in multitude of various industrial applications.\n\nIn structure mill SKRM produces pre-shaped hot-rolled custom designed as well as standard sections, with strict dimensional tolerances. At the userâs end this translates into lower tooling charges, reduced idle times and substantial saving on scrap material, otherwise generated due to turning and milling. During the production of special profiles by hot rolling the input billet is formed into lengths up to 11.800 METRE using two oppositely rotating cylindrical rolls."
