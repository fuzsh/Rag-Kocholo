        "text": "A typical manual mill is the knee mill. While these machines can vary significantly, the parts shown here are typical of most mills.\n\nColumn\n\nColumn Components\n\nKnee\n\nKnee Components\n\nSaddle\n\nSaddle Components\n\nTable\n\nTable Components\n\nRam\n\nRam Components\n\nHead\n\nHead Components\n\nColumn\n\nThe primary casting that positions the working parts of the mill is called the column. Often, the base and column are integrated into a single component. Here the base is simply a feature of the column. More…\n\nKnee\n\nThe component for which the knee mill takes its name is shown here. The knee moves vertically, and supports the saddle and table. More…\n\nSaddle\n\nThe saddle supports the table on the knee, and provides movement left, right, in, and out from the operator’s perspective. More…\n\nTable\n\nOn a typical knee mill, the table is able to move in three axes of motion. Work is mounted on the table by means of strap clamps, vises, chucks, or other workholding devices. More…\n\nRam\n\nThe ram allows the milling machine to be adapted to a variety of workpiece configurations and sizes. The ram is sometimes mounted to a turret as shown here. More…\n\nHead"
