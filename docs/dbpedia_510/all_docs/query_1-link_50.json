        "text": "Hi,\n\nAtlas MFB Mill Arbors\n\nHow are these 2 arbors used?\n\nDoes 'A' use a cutter with slot/holes that are locked into the 2 pins??\n\nIf 'B' gets held in with the drawbar how are the 2 slots used??\n\nThanks\n\nat\n\nFor the long arbor, the nose of the spindle SHOULD have a driver screwed to the face of the spindle. That driver has two pins similar to your Shell Mill Arbor.\n\nThe pins engage the slots on the collar of the B arbor.\n\nYES, for the A Shell Mill driver/ arbor. You find a tool that has slots just like the B has, and hold that tool in place with the washer and screw.\n\nI kinda' thought something was missing for the long one.\n\nI don't have the machine anymore. The new owner is telling me that\n\nthe drawbar is tight but the arbor is loose. If you use a spindle nose ''pinned driver'' adaptor\n\nwouldn't that make the drawbar tighten the arbor against the spindle but the\n\nmt2 would not be seated?? I'm guessing this is OK since the arbor is supported on the other end??\n\nThanks\n\nYes the nose support bracket is a must. Dont use the arbor with out it\n\nGP\n\nOn Tuesday, December 8, 2020, 11:29:30 AM EST, angelo via groups.io <angelo4967@...> wrote:\n\nI kinda' thought something was missing for the long one.\n\nI don't have the machine anymore.

If you don't have one Making one is the only way out its not that difficult\n\nGP\n\nOn Tuesday, December 8, 2020, 11:35:11 AM EST, angelo via groups.io <angelo4967@...> wrote:\n\nForgot to mention, with the ''extinct'' 1''-10tpi spindle thread where would you even find that adaptor??\n\nIf the drawbar is tight but the arbor is loose, then the drawbar is too long. It should be short enough that it pulls the arbor tight into the Morse taper socket before the threads bottom out. Or, maybe, the taper has been reamed out too large for the arbor.\n\nIf he is using just an end mill, he can probably get away without the “pinned driver” adaptor. The Morse taper will take quite a bit of torque. For a large cutter, though, he should use the adaptor.\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Tuesday, December 8, 2020, 11:29:30 AM EST, angelo via groups.io <angelo4967@...> wrote:\n\nI kinda' thought something was missing for the long one.\n\nI don't have the machine anymore.

It may be a pulley holder to drive something like the Marvin vertical milling head, or something else entire.\n\nI have two of arbor B, one in 7/8\" & the other is, IIRC, 1-1/4\". I've been a couple months from having my MF running for many years now.\n\nI did buy an MT2 to ER32 chuck for holding endmills, and it is about as short as your arbor A. It would only be useable on stuff clamped to an angle plate, I believe. There is an extract from Popular Mechanics in files about using endmills on the Atlas mills, and reading that is as close to experience using a horizontal mill.\n\nI have used vertical mills, Bridgeport clones, but not a horizontal, so far.\n\nHTH!\n\nBill in OKC\n\nWilliam R.

Running the arbor without the overarm installed and the support bushing engaged is a recipe for a destroyed arbor at the minimum. Bob in Tucson, I hope you were photographing the set-uo without the overarm, to illustrate the arbor and spacers.\n\nCharlie in the Finger Lakes of NY\n\nWell, I made this spindle nose protector?\n\nI'll send it to the guy that has the machine.\n\n1-7/8'' OD.
