        "text": "Atlas Holdings LLC, a Greenwich, Conn.,-based private investment and equity firm, has formed Atlas Properties, a real estate industrial investment platform that launched with the purchase of a 23-property portfolio of mission-critical industrial real estate for $300 million.\n\nAtlas Properties investors have committed more than $500 million of additional equity capital, which in combination with market debt financing, will support more than $1 billion of future growth opportunities.\n\nFurther details about the initial portfolio, including the seller or sellers and locations of the national portfolio, were not disclosed.\n\nREAD ALSO: A Recap of the Industrial Sector’s Performance in 2023\n\nFounded in 2002, Atlas and its affiliates own and operate 27 companies with 300 facilities across the globe. The firm’s investments have been in numerous sectors including automotive, building materials, capital equipment, construction services, food manufacturing and distribution, metals processing, packaging, paper, power generation, printing, pulp, supply chain management and wood products. The companies generate approximately $16 billion in revenues annually.\n\nSignificant real estate footprints\n\nTim Fazio, Atlas co-founder & managing partner, said in a prepared statement Atlas has built extensive knowledge of industrial real estate through its businesses which have significant real estate footprints. He said the formation of Atlas Properties is a natural progression of the firm’s investment strategy and is fully consistent with its longstanding practice of investing in areas where its sector and operating experience give it a competitive edge.\n\nAtlas Principal Greg Blake, who joined the firm in 2021 to develop its value creation strategies through the large and growing real estate portfolio owned by its entities, said in prepared remarks that Atlas portfolio companies have previously monetized real estate assets in the sale-leaseback market through one-off transactions. The creation of Atlas Properties will enable the firm to leverage its knowledge of industrial credits, property types and the underlying mission criticality of real estate owned by companies in key Atlas industry sectors, Blake noted.\n\nProskauer Rose LLP served as legal advisor to Atlas for Atlas Properties.\n\nRecent acquisitions\n\nAtlas announced several acquisitions last year that included real estate properties. In early October, the firm closed on the purchase of Varsity Brands Herff Jones Graduation Business, which included the Scholastic and Collegiate brand portfolio and its manufacturing facilities. Products include commencement caps and gowns, fine paper, jewelry and frames.\n\nIn September, Atlas signed a definitive agreement to purchase two Canadian pulp mills from West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd.—the Quesnel River Pulp mill in Quesnel, British Columbia, and the Slave Lake Pulp mill in Slave Lake, Alberta."
