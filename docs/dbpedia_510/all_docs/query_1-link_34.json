        "text": "Atlas Web Technologies, a division of Atlas Roofing Corporation, announced it will invest in two of its paper mills to significantly increase capacity.\n\nThe manufacturer and supplier of 100% recycled paper and coated glass flexible facers to the polyiso and gypsum building materials markets will make these improvements at its Meridian, Miss., and Franklin, Ohio, paper mills. According to a release, the investments will increase capacity by approximately 30% over the next two years. This comes on the heels of a recent capacity expansion project at the Meridian coated glass facer plant and will help Atlas grow their coverage as the largest flexible facer manufacturer in North America.\n\n“We are very excited to be making these improvements in Meridian and Franklin,” said Matthew Bennett, vice president and general manager of Atlas Web Technologies. “This move demonstrates a commitment to the industry, to our customers, and to improving our position as the largest and most innovative flexible facer manufacturer in the country.”\n\nThe company states the capacity improvements will help \"satisfy growing demand in the polyiso and gypsum facer businesses,\" and help Atlas attract new customers as housing and construction numbers steadily increase.\n\n“A lot of people talk about being customer focused, but at Atlas Web Technologies we truly listen to our customers and work to meet their needs on a daily basis,” Bennett said. “The investment in these paper mills is a testament to the exceptional quality of product we make and is a direct result of being a customer-driven business. The future of our business is bright, and we look forward to helping our customers grow.”\n\nThe capacity improvements in Meridian and Franklin are scheduled to be completed by the middle of 2024."
