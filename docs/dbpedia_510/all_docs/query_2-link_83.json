        "text": "CLINTON — The Atlas Distilling Co., which expects to open in the village of Clinton later this summer, announced Sunday that it is changing its name to Alévri Mill Distilling Co.\n\n“Due to legal reasons beyond our control, we are required to change our name,” a news release stated. “We did not take this lightly as we, along with our community, love the Atlas name and the historical significants of the Atlas Mill. The Atlas Mill is still an integral part of our identity and future business plans.”\n\nThe distillery was originally named after the Atlas Mill, a historic and sentimental former flour mill and feed store which, when it closed due to bankruptcy in 2006, was the oldest continuously operating business in Michigan.\n\nAfter receiving the cease and desist letter from representatives of a company that had trademarked the name already in the same industry, co-owner Ethan Gibson said that the team of co-owners and attorneys pored over other name possibilities that had historical significance or connection to the area.\n\nThe team dug into the mill’s history but found it very difficult to find a name that was not already trademarked or connecting the mill to a location, but geographic names could not be trademarked.\n\n“They’re all taken. It’s amazing how thorough every other brewery and distillery in the world is with the names. Everything is taken. Even with the most obscure things,” Gibson said.\n\nGibson said that the team ended up with Alévri, which is means “flour” in Greek — as the mill, which was named after a Greek god, was originally a flour mill.\n\n“We figured even if at first glance the name doesn’t scream local or anything, we know that once we’re established and once we’re open, it’s going to become just as much of a part of Clinton as any other business that’s been there for awhile,” Gibson said. “Personally, I would rather have something that’s 100% original to us and Clinton that … no one but Clinton says they own. Maybe in the long run Alévri will have a significant tie to Clinton or vice versa.”\n\nThe distillery’s owners began by purchasing the property of the defunct Atlas Milling Company and received permission from former owners to use their name on lines of spirits that they are developing.\n\nAccording to Gibson, the distillery’s downtown tasting room is almost complete and, while he did not give an exact day pending final approval from the state, he estimated that the distillery will open to the public this summer.\n\n“It’s not going to delay it too much because thank God it happened now before all the bottles were printed, before the branding was up. So we got lucky in that sense,” Gibson said. “We’ll be in there, finishing the tasting room in the next coupe of weeks and the rest will just be a couple of legal matters to take care of and final inspections… .”"
