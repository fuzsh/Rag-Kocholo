        "text": "Valuation Policy during Covid-19\n\nWe have received a small number of enquiries regarding listing new properties for sale during the lockdown period. We are also aware that some estate agents are offering a ‘virtual valuation’ system so that properties can be listed at this time.\n\nWe have given this considerable thought and feel this is inappropriate and presently against Government instructions, although we can offer a limited listing service in certain circumstances. Those agents may feel they are gaining a market advantage but our view is that in most cases this will not be in the interest of vendors for the following reasons.\n\nThere are very few potential buyers out there willing to view houses and actual viewings should not take place anyway under lockdown. ‘Virtual’ viewings may result in conditional offers but these would be of little value whilst surveyors, lenders and solicitors are unable to proceed in the normal way. Potential purchasers are likely to want to try and renegotiate once an actual physical viewing can take place prior to completion, which could cause vendors much disappointment. There may be some cash buyers who may forego a survey and viewing but surely any offers would be ridiculously low.\n\nOur view is that there is no point marketing to a virtually non-existent market. Our advice for most potential sellers is to let us know you are interested in coming on the market so that when the government gives us the go-ahead to start trading again we can swiftly do so. We have the capacity to value and market your house within days at the start of an emerging market which will give you the good chance of an early sale. Any houses marketed without proper photographs, sales particulars and floor plans will be at a serious disadvantage in an emerging market.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances where vendors need an urgent sale, whether on the market now or not, then please contact us as we will advise you taking each case on its individual merits. Our online auction service may be particularly suited to your needs.\n\nOur aim is to continue to offer you a responsible & professional estate agency service in these very difficult times.\n\nIf you would like to book a free market appraisal please fill in the form below and we will call you to arrange an appointment at your convenience.\n\nValuation Policy during Covid-19\n\nWe have received a small number of enquiries regarding listing new properties for sale during the lockdown period.
