Office spaces can range from 2,000 SF to 8,600 SF. The building’s façade was renovated and preserved with windows now re-arched as they had been in the past and the smokestack was restored. Materials salvaged from the demolished wing were kept to authentically restore the structure.\n\nThe project won the 2019 First Frontier Urban Transformation Award from the Altoona Blair County Development (ABCD) Corporation."
