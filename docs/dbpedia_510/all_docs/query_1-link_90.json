That’s what Atlas Building Group did when it built Urban Waterfront, a 2,490-square-foot home on Atlas Road in Coeur d’Alene.\n\nThe tall, narrow home has plenty of big windows allowing a panoramic view of the Spokane River. Even with a smaller-sized lot, the two-story home has enough room to include four bedrooms, four full bathrooms, a half bath and a three-car garage.\n\n“It’s very view-centric,” said Hayden Anderl, luxury property specialist with Coldwell Banker.\n\nMany of the former timber mill sites along Seltice Way are gradually being transformed into appealing residential communities, all with an emphasis on stunning waterfront views. This includes the Atlas Waterfront Development that will include 30 lots, trails and river access.\n\nStunning is also one of the words Parade of Homes guests were using as they toured the home. Once they finished admiring the river view, they walked through the front door and into a spacious living room dominated by a large rock wall that includes a fireplace, a TV and four large, illuminated cubbies that can hold artwork or other items.\n\nThe wood of choice for this focal point as well as much of the home’s stairs, doors and other trim is black walnut, which provides an impressive eye-catching sheen. Black stone on counters, the master bath and other areas also complements the walnut.\n\nPlenty of mirrors are also used strategically around the home to add a sense of depth and reflect the black walnut even more.\n\nAnderl said the kitchen is also impressive. It includes a big freezer, a nook and a well-lit glassed-in wine room. The main kitchen window opens in pass-through style and connects to a patio with a seating area and built-in gas barbecue.\n\n[adrotategroup=“1”]\n\nThe bedrooms and a large master suite with a patio that faces the river are located on the second floor. The bathroom includes a soaking tub surrounded by glass.\n\nA bar area and lounge are second-floor features that provide an excellent opportunity for river watching.\n\nThe home also uses smart technology to allow the homeowners to control surround sound, blinds and other home features from their phone.\n\nThe home received several honors from the Parade of Homes in the Tamarack category including best interior, best curb appeal and best use of innovation.
