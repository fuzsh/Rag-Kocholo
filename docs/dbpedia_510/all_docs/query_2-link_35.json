        "text": "The Atlas Brass Mill is beautiful kitchen tool suitable for chefs and beginner cooks alike. The handmade grinding mechanism is designed to maximize flavor and aroma, producing a generous amount of salt or pepper with each turn of the handle.\n\nFeatures adjustable grinding from fine-to-coarse. Each mill has a flanged base for stability and a durable all metal body. Please note that due to the natural chrome material, these mills will age and patina over time.\n\nWHY WE LOVE IT\n\nAtlas Mills are the origin of the phrase pepper grinder since these mills actually grind the pepper. Common pepper mills only smash the peppercorns which severely limits the flavor release. The Atlas mill is a unique piece of European tradition that is functionally the best in the world.\n\nDETAILS\n\npepper mill\n\ndurable polished chrome body\n\nlong arm makes grinding easy\n\nFlanged base for stability\n\nManufactured by a small, family-run company in northern Greece.\n\nAssembly Instructions: the handle is stored inside the mill body during shipment. Please unscrew the nut at the top of the mill to remove the lid, take out the handle, replace the lid, place the handle on top, and screw the nut down tight.\n\nSIZE\n\n9\" tall\n\nMetal shaft 10mm/ 0.44″ diameter\n\nMetal mechanism 38mm / 1.5″ diameter"
