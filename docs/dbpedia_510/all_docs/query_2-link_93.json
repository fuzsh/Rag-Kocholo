        "text": "Last week there was a CL posting for 2 Atlas Horizontal Mills. An MFB, which was complete (minus Guards), and a what appeared to be an (aftermarket?) extra long table ~24\"and an MFC that was working, but missing parts. I was trying to make a deal on both, but I couldn't make up it to see them for another day. In the mean time some one purchased the MFB. Continuing to talk with the seller, he was willing to lower the price on the MFC to a level I was willing of commit to purchase based only on our conversations and the pictures he sent me, before physically seeing it.\n\nI'd love to restore to 100% original, but the prices people want for original parts means my near term goal is just to get it running, making the parts when I can, and keeping my eyes open for the factory parts I'm missing.\n\nThe previous owner was using it to make precision fish mouth cuts in tubing for his bicycle frame business, so he had it set up to drive hole saws. He said he purchased the two mills from another frame maker, who was also using them to make precision cuts on frame tubing.\n\nI was too curious to see what I had, so I forgot to take a pictures of it before I started taking it apart.\n\nThe table is missing both Balance Crank Handles.\n\nThe mill came with a working Change-o-Matic, but was missing the Table Power Feed and Drive Shaft. I had hoped the Feed Gear (MF-17a) might be still on to the Table Feed Screw, but alas no luck. I've since acquired the Table Feed Assembly, but still need the Driveshaft (MF-8X) and Feed Gear (MF-17a)\n\nI found this picture online of what is reportedly an MF-17a Feed Drive Gear. Knowing the OD of the Table Feed Screw, thus the ID of the gear in the picture, and counting the teeth, with a little measuring of the image, I came up with a Diametral Pitch of 24?. What I'm not sure of is the pressure angle? (Though zooming in on the picture makes me think..... it's 20 degrees vs 14.5?)\n\nDoes anyone have the Specs on the Feed Gear (MF-17a)? I'm going to contact Clausing to see if they have one available, for a price that doesn't break the bank. If not, I'm going to look at making one.\n\nMcmaster Carr has pre-machined Gear Blanks that you can cut to width and bore to size. https://www.mcmaster.com/#6847k18/=1biz35i\n\nI just need to figure out how to machine the tangs.\n\nI'm not sure if parts were mixed between the MFB and MFC, but the Arbor Support I received was the earlier M1-8. (Btw if anyone has an M1-60 arbor support, but needs an M1-8, I'd be happy to trade).\n\nThen there are the things that make we scratch my head.......\n\nIt appears someone didn't know how to remove the Arbor Drive, so they just cut the Pins Off! I found the remains of a pin in the table slot.\n\nI guess some felt the Arbor support was too long?\n\nIt also came with a 1\" Arbor, minus the spacers and nut. It;s also missing is the factory Drawbar, though a piece of all-tread was provided.\n\n(Thanks to wa5cab and others for uploading all the Atlas Drawings. They will be invaluable in moving forward with my project.) A factory style draw bar will be one of my first projects. I'm still trying to determine the best way to put the keyway in the spacers when I get around to making them. (I might have to purchase a broach set.)\n\nMystery Part...\n\nI found this in the bottom of the sump, on the Change-o-Matic side. It is a solid sleeve/spacer there is no set screw in it.\n\nI've looked at all the drawings and also ghostses 4 part youtube series on the assembly of an MFC, and I have not found where or if the piece is from the mill?\n\nAny feed back is welcome.\n\nBTW, It appears the MFB is now being parted out on eBay, which just kills me!"
