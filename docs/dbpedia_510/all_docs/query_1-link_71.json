        "text": "Atlas was a mine engine who used to work on the Mid Sodor Railway, who now works as a maintenance engine on the Skarloey Railway.\n\nBio\n\nAtlas used to work on the Mid Sodor Railway as a mine engine. He is in charge of a lot of the goods trains on the railway. Atlas lived in the sheds with Duke, Stuart, Falcon and for a short period of time, Andreas and Stanley.\n\nFollowing the closure of the Mid Sodor Railway, Atlas was sold to a zinc mine near Cregwir where he was painted blue and given a cowcatcher and sideplates. From there, he ran the tram-line to Harwick working next to the tugboats Ten Cents and Drollan. This was until 1953 when he was \"returned to where he came from\" following closure of the mines.\n\nIt was revealed in Storm Damage that he returned to the Mid Sodor area to replace an old boiler in the flour mill. Here he became known to the Arlesdale engines simply as 'Old Mill' the boiler engine assumed to have been there since the beginning. In 2011 however after a fierce storm on August 17th the mill building endured heavy damage, causing much concern amongst the engines when it was revealed that they may close as a result. Blister 1 however was able to figure out Atlas' true identity after 'Old Mill' mentioning his funnel. With the help of Charlie Hatt the Skarloey Railway purchased Atlas to become their new no. 10 and new maintenance engine.\n\nLivery\n\nAtlas is painted red with blue lining, the traditional livery for the Skarloey Railway's steam locomotives. Prior to this, he was painted brown on the Mid-Sodor Railway, and during his time on the Cregwir tramway, he was painted blue with matching sideplates and he had a red cowcatcher over his bufferbeam.\n\nBasis\n\nAtlas is a cab-less Jouef Decauville 0-4-0PT loco that was built in 1899.\n\nAppearances\n\nSeason 1 STMY - Rough Start (as The Old Mill)\n\nSeason 2 STMY - Arrogance, Mistrust (does not speak), Storm Damage, Last Straw and Confidence\n\nAdeline the Phantom Engine - Ivo's Number, Munitions, Unfinished Business, Final Train, Past Tense (mentioned) and His Grace\n\nVoice Actor\n\nLuke Ryan\n\nNotes\n\nLike most versions, WildNorWester's take on Atlas was based on early observations and notes taken by the fandom before Wilbert Awdry's full Mid-Sodor fleet was fully disclosed to the public in 2020.\n\nHis name was originally speculated by the fandom that was the Mine Engine according to various documents, but it was until Atlas' actor that the name \"Atlas\" was the name of another engine.\n\nHis faces on his original model are based on that of Oliver the Excavator from the TV series. Following WildNorWester's transition to 3D faces, Atlas' faces are purely original modeled by Indy.\n\nHe and Duke are the only engines that moved from the Mid Sodor Railway to the Skarloey Railway to not have any buffers."
