        "text": "Here at Atlas, field services mean a lot of things to us. From drilling & tapping some new holes in a mill stand for a steel manufacturer to machining a modification launch tower for NASA, we have successfully performed an extremely broad range of field services for our customers. As of today, we have performed various field services for our customers in 46 states and seven countries around the world. On a daily basis, we receive new requests to discuss exciting new projects that most people believe, before speaking with us, just can’t be done. Sometimes our customers are concerned about the harsh environment of the project location, the complexity of the scope of work, or the short time frame in which the project must be completed. Many of these situations present unique challenges and some seem flat out impossible at first glance. But, with the experienced team at Atlas, there are very few rare situations in which we cannot provide a solution. At Atlas, our team of Engineers and highly skilled Field Services Technicians works together on every project to provide our customers with the very best and most economical solution for their project needs. For example, we have created custom-designed portable equipment to perform such tasks as grinding a 10-foot diameter bearing surface and even manufactured our own portable hydraulic CNC milling/drilling machine to perform highly precise operations at the worksite. Our team loves to create solutions for the most demanding circumstances.\n\nBelow we have listed some of the services that we perform with our Atlas Field Services just to give you some ideas.\n\nIf you ever have any questions regarding one of your upcoming projects or you have an emergency situation, give us a call at 1-855-4UpTime (855-487-8463) (24/7).\n\nOur overall goal with our Atlas Field Services is to get the customer back in operation as fast as possible. In order to meet that goal, our highly-skilled Field Services Technicians are comprised of Journeyman Machinist, Welders, and high-level Metrology (Laser Tracker/Laser Scanning) Experts.\n\nWe do not hire contractors like some other field services companies do to perform the work of our Atlas Machinists or Welders. When our team arrives at your work site, you can rest assured that they are an “Atlas Trained” employee and not temporary labor we just hired yesterday. That’s not who we are or what we believe that our customers deserve. When our customers put faith and trust in us to handle their most challenging tasks, we take it very seriously. It is not just a project or job; it is our reputation on the line. Here at Atlas, we will do what is right for the customer, at the right time, with the right people. That is the Atlas way."
