        "text": "As construction continues at the TimberHP manufacturing plant in Madison, Maine, we only grow more fascinated by the rich history of the mill. The building actually includes two different mills.\n\nThere’s the newer mill, built in 1980. This is where TimberHP will make wood fiber insulation. In July, the outside façade of this main building will begin to change dramatically as equipment, extending as high as eight stories above the building’s existing roof, is erected to convey, refine, dry, and blend daily shipments of wood chips. The interior of the building will be transformed as well with the installation of three separate manufacturing lines.\n\nBehind the newer building, right along the Kennebec River, is the old mill."
