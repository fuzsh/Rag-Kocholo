        "text": "GENESEE COUNTY, MI -- A county park that was established just four years ago could be expanded depending on the result of a grant request to the state.\n\nThe county Board of Commissioners is scheduled to consider giving the Parks and Recreation Commission permission to apply for funding from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund when it meets Wednesday, July 20.\n\nA staff review sent to commissioners this week says the grant of up to $300,000 could be used to help acquire property bordered by Atlas County Park, located along the north side of Hegel Road in Atlas Township.\n\nThe densely forested park was established in 2018 after the county purchased 155 acres of land from a private party, also by using a state grant to help pay for most of the purchase.\n\nParks Director Barry June told commissioners in a report that the Parks and Recreation Commission was contacted by another property owner, interested in selling more than 49 acres of land that border the existing park.\n\nThe county has already submitted a land acquisition request to the DNR, according to the report, and must apply for grant funding to be considered in the state’s current funding round by Aug. 12.\n\n“This property was previously identified as a target property discussed by the Parks Commission on April 14, 2022, as part of the parks property acquisition plan to expand existing parks and/or provide buffer zones for current park activities,” June’s report to commissioners says. “Acquisition of the property would give access to the Iron Belle Trail on Gale Road, provide 325 additional feet of water frontage on the Atlas Mill Pond, and preserve wetlands.”\n\nJune’s reports says that if the sale is completed, the property owner has agreed to gift more than three acres of adjacent wetlands to the park system, increasing the acreage of Atlas County Park to more than 207 acres.\n\nRead more at The Flint Journal:\n\nNew 155-acre county park to open in Atlas Township\n\nHere’s a look inside the newest Genesee County park"
