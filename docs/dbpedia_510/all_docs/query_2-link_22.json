        "text": "If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, we accept returns on select items within 14 days of receipt. Items must be postmarked by the 7th day to be eligible for a refund. Please visit our Returns page to begin a return for your order.\n\nPlease note all original shipping charges are non-refundable and return shipping costs are the responsibility of the buyer. We recommend all returns be sent insured and with tracking as we cannot be held responsible for lost or damaged products. It is the responsibility of the buyer to ensure the item is adequately packaged for return. Shoppe Amber Interiors cannot accept responsibility for any packages lost, stolen or damaged in transit. Once we receive your item we will process your return and a refund will be issued to either your original payment method or gift card. You will receive an email confirmation once your return has been accepted and your refund will be processed within 5-7 business days of receipt.\n\nAll items must be in new, unused condition with any tags still attached and packing intact. Returns that are damaged, soiled or altered may not be accepted and sent back to the customer.\n\nAll custom orders, made to order items, flash sale items, furniture (excluding vintage), artwork, sale items, and chandeliers are final sale and cannot be returned.\n\nIn the instance a non-returnable or final sale item is approved for a return, a credit will be issued minus a 20% restocking fee. All credits are issued in the form of an electronic gift card.\n\nThis serves as a confirmation of your Made to Order item. Please review the following order agreement form as it serves as your final order confirmation. All made to order items are final sale once the order has been placed into production. Payment is made in full at the time the order is placed. If for any reason you wish to cancel, there is a 48-hour grace period between your order and the commencement of production. Once your order has been put into production, no order changes can be made. Once the 48-hour grace period has passed, the order is considered final sale. If you placed this order mistakenly or need to cancel within 48 hours of the time the order was placed, please contact shoppe@shoppeamberinteriors.com or call (888)-670-3689.\n\nPlease note that all lead times are approximate and are subject to change. Lead times are strictly quoted as production time only and do not include transit time. Please allow an additional 1-3 weeks for shipment. If multiple items are ordered together, the full order will ship once all items are completed.\n\nNaturally, fabric varies from dye lot to dye lot, so understand (and appreciate) that an exact match cannot be guaranteed. Being that wood finishes are applied by hand, you can expect up to a 10% color variation within the finished product. We suggest ordering samples of our fabrics and finishes ahead of placing an order to confirm your selection.\n\nDue to the handmade nature of these products, dimensions can vary +/- 2 inches. It is up to the buyer to ensure that the finished product will fit inside entry points upon delivery of the item. Shoppe Amber Interiors will not be held responsible if the piece does not fit into the buyerâ€™s home. If this situation occurs, customers are subject to a 20% restocking fee for the returned item pending approval from Shoppe Amber Interiors, in addition to any return shipping costs.\n\nWe personally inspect every item to ensure that it meets our quality standards. Shoppe will not be held responsible for any damages after the item(s) have left our showroom/warehouse. It is the responsibility of the recipient to inspect all items before signing the bill of lading or allowing the driver to leave. Should any transit damage be discovered please contact us immediately and notate in thorough detail on the bill of lading. Should you discover any damage after the delivery has been accepted without notating on the bill of lading we will not be able to file a damage claim with the appropriate company. Shoppe will accept responsibility for defective or damaged products if it is determined to be a manufacturing issue."
