        "text": "Chris is thankful for the values that his hometown instilled in him and how they prepared him to make the most of the opportunities in life. He wants to convert some of the lessons he has learned in thirty years of successful entrepreneurship and the fruits of that success to help Vicksburg make the most of its opportunities and be as successful in the 21st century as it was in the 20th.\n\nAnd so, he has committed his own capital to The Mill restoration in what he calls “sustainable philanthropy:” investments that restore and inspire communities while equipping entrepreneurs and artists.\n\nArts and cultural tourism is already a multi-billion-dollar industry in Michigan. With Chicago, South Bend, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, and Ann Arbor all within a couple-of-hours drive, there are millions of potential conference attendees and concert-goers.\n\nAs a historic events venue, with onsite amenities, craft brewing, beer gardens, outdoor recreation and golf within walking distance—adjacent to a restored Vicksburg village a few minutes away—The Mill at Vicksburg will become a regional destination. Once again, it will become an economic and cultural engine for its community."
