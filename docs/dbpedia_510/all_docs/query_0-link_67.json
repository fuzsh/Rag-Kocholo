Also as Samuel Courtauld and Co of the same address and Lustre Fibres of Foleshill Road, Coventry. (1947)\n\nCourtaulds was a manufacturer of fabric, clothing, artificial fibres, and chemicals.\n\nThe Courtauld family was descended from Augustine Courtauld, son of a Huguenot refugee who settled in England in 1685; the family were silversmiths.\n\n1775 George Courtauld (1761-1823), great-grandson of Augustine, was apprenticed to a Spitalfields silk weaver and set up as a silk throwster.\n\n1785 George made the first of a number of trips to America where, in 1789, he married Ruth Minton.\n\n1794 Shortly after their son Samuel's birth, George and Ruth returned to England\n\n1798 George set up in business at a mill at Pebmarsh, Essex, manufacturing silk, crepe and textiles - George Courtauld and Co with his cousin Peter Taylor (1790-1850) - before moving to a larger mill at Bocking. George Courtauld was an enterprising, restless character, temperamentally unsuited to working in a partnership.\n\n1810 Samuel Courtauld was managing his own silk mill in Braintree, Essex.\n\n1814 George Courtauld was granted a patent for an improved spindle\n\nBy 1816 Samuel's position, and that of his family, was financially perilous. Samuel set up in business on his own account as a silk throwster in a small mill at Bocking, Essex. His father went back to America, where he died in 1823.\n\n1818,George Courtauld returned to America, leaving Samuel Courtauld and Taylor to expand the business – now known as Courtauld and Taylor – by building further mills in Halstead and Bocking.\n\nGeorge settled in Ohio where he purchased large tracts of land on which he settled some of his family. He inspired all, apparently, except his son Samuel, with his vision of founding a new order of society in Ohio. He was a friend of Robert Owen, also a textile manufacturer who had founded the similar Owenite Settlements. George often wrote to his son Samuel, who was managing and expanding his own silk mills in Braintree, Halstead and Bocking, urging him to give up textiles and come 'to the land of opportunity'. But Samuel did not emigrate and continued steadfastly to expand Courtaulds through subsequent centuries.\n\n1825 Samuel installed a steam engine at the Bocking mill, and then installed power looms at Halstead.\n\n1828 Samuel recruited his brother, George Courtauld II (1802-1861), as partner\n\nHis mills remained heavily dependent on young female workers – in 1838, over 92% of his workforce was female.\n\n1849 Recruited, as another partner, fellow Unitarian social reformer Peter Alfred Taylor (1819-1891), the son of Peter Taylor who died the following year.\n\nBy 1850, Courtauld employed over 2,000 people in his three silk mills. By this time Courtauld was a very wealthy man but was also suffering from deafness.\n\nA boom in black crape developed in Victorian England as the ritual of mourning was formalized, publicized, and commercialized. Samuel Courtauld and Co did very well out of it, becoming the country's biggest manufacturer of mourning crape. Until crape began to fall from fashion in the 1880s, the partners were regularly earning well over 30 per cent on their capital.\n\nCourtauld planned to spend more time on his country estate Gosfield Hall near Halstead but could not convince himself to retire, and continued to play an active role in the company until just before he died in March 1881, leaving his estate to his 2 adopted children.\n\n1898 Samuel Courtauld (1876-1947), great nephew of Samuel Courtauld, joined the company.\n\nc.1900 Acquired British rights to the viscose process for making \"synthetic silk\", at the instigation of H. G. Tetley, the joint managing director, who promoted the shift from silk to rayon.\n\n1908 Samuel Courtauld became general manager of all of the textile mills, with the support of H. G. Tetley, the dominant force in the company.\n\n1913 Reconstruction of Samuel Courtauld and Co which was renamed as Courtauld and Co Ltd[1]\n\n1913-39 Annual reports in Coventry Archives[2]\n\n1916 Started production of sulphuric acid, and production of carbon disulphide at Trafford Park factory, to safeguard supplies for fibre production\n\nBy 1919 the company was referred to as Courtaulds Ltd.\n\n1921 Samuel Courtauld became chairman of the Courtauld company but is chiefly remembered today as the founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.\n\nCourtauld's policy of financial conservatism, with large reserves and a cautious dividend policy, protected the company during the period when many new rayon enterprises were established and then went bust.\n\nWilliam Julien Courtauld was also a benefactor of the arts: he gave artworks to the Essex County Council chamber at Chelmsford and the town hall at Braintree in the 1930s.\n\n1920s Developed cellulose acetate for a new fibre.\n\n1928 Courtaulds started acetate rayon manufacture\n\nEstablished engineering department to design machines for using new fibres.\n\n1935 A joint venture company, British Cellophane Ltd was formed between La Cellophane SA and Courtaulds when they began building a major factory in Bridgwater, Somerset. This produced thin transparent Cellophane films for packaging.\n\n1936 \"The leading manufacturers of men's and women's hosiery, underwear and outerwear continually specify Courtaulds Rayon - the best in the world.\" [3]\n\n1940 formed British Nylon Spinners jointly with ICI.\n\n1941 American Viscose Co. was sold.\n\n1947 As a result of the sale of American investments, Courtaulds had £45 million in liquid assets; it constructed new factories for nylon in South Wales, for tyre yarn in Cumberland, and others were planned for Dundee and Belfast; North Wales rayon staple plant was being doubled and the rayon fibre plant in Preston was being expanded, plus textile plants in Accrington and Burton-on-Trent[4]\n\n1947 British Industries Fair Advert as Manufacturers of Rayon Yarns, Staple fibre and Rayon Textiles of all descriptions. Distributors Overseas of Rayon Yarns and Staple Fibre: Lustre Fibres, Limited Coventry; Rayon Textiles, Samuel Courtauld and Co. Ltd., London. (Textiles Section - Earls Court, Ground Floor, Stands No. 69 and 74) [5]\n\n1950 Opened a new factory in Carrickfergus to make viscose rayon.\n\n1951 Had developed sufficient knowledge of wood pulp (one of the feedstocks) to develop a new process using eucalyptus; formed supply company in South Africa to safeguard feedstock supplies.\n\n1957 Acquired British Celanese with which the company had common interests in acetic anhydride, acetone, acetic acid and related chemicals\n\n1958 Acquired Cellon Ltd in order to access its experience in colouring of materials, especially relevant to Cellophane.\n\n1959 Courtaulds acquired National Plastics, and Gossard (Holdings) Ltd which extended the company's experience in using its fibres[6].\n\nBy 1960 Courtaulds had acquired Pearlite Box, Reads and Betts and Co to expand its experience in packaging[7].\n\n1960 As part the company's diversification into the paint industry, acquired Pinchin, Johnson and Associates Ltd[8]. Had also acquired rights to process for making caprolactam, a feedstock for nylon.\n\n1961 Courtaulds acquired British Enka Artificial Silk Co[9]\n\n1961 ICI made (what was then) Britain's largest take-over bid for Courtaulds[10] but the bid was not accepted by sufficient Courtaulds' shareholders[11]\n\n1962 Courtaulds returned to its plans for reorganising the textile industry[12]. The company has said that by the early 1960s it was becoming increasingly apparent to it that the provisions of the Cotton Industry Act 1959 were insufficient to ensure the future and strength of all sectors of the textile industry; new capital and management were needed to achieve re-equipment and re-organisation into the different and more stream-lined groups essential if the industry was to become economically viable.\n\nIn the autumn of 1962, Courtaulds conceived a plan which it called its Northern Project; it entered into negotiations with five major textile groups, namely -\n\nLancashire Cotton Corporation,\n\nCombined English Mills (Spinners)\n\nEnglish Sewing Cotton Co\n\nFine Spinners and Doublers and\n\nTootals\n\nIt was at first envisaged that Courtaulds would acquire the five companies but this was later modified to a scheme whereby the five would exchange their existing shares for shares in a new joint company and Courtaulds would buy shares in the new company by providing relatively large amounts of cash to finance re-equipment. The Board of Trade were informed of the intended re-grouping.\n\nBetween December 1962 and April 1963 Courtaulds, ICI, and the five textile companies concerned, together examined the Northern Project in detail, but a financial agreement was not reached.\n\n1963 As part of their joint policy to strengthen the textile industry by vertical integration, ICI and Courtaulds contributed £10 million to English Sewing Cotton Co to enable that company to bid for Tootal and, soon after, acquired a 10 percent interest in Carrington and Dewhurst, spinners and weavers of man-made fibres[13]\n\n1963 With a number of builders merchants, Courtaulds set up Celanese Building Components to encourage greater use of plastics in the building industry[14]\n\n1963 Acquired Bairns-Wear.[15]\n\n1964 ICI and Courtaulds went their own ways - ICI acquired British Nylon Spinners and Courtaulds carried on with another nylon range.[16]\n\n1964 Courtaulds acquired the whole of the equity capital of Lancashire Cotton Corporation and Fine Spinners and Doublers, thereby becoming the owner of 30% of the spinning capacity of the Lancashire textile industry.\n\n1964 Exchange of subsidiaries with Thomas Tilling: Courtaulds acquired Spray and Burgass, dyers and finishers of Nottingham; Tillings acquired J. Walton (Electrical), a subsidiary of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation[17]\n\n1965 The British Enka factory at Aintree was re-developed for use by another Courtaulds subsidiary, Pinchin, Johnson and Associates[18]\n\n1966 Announced the closure of:[19]\n\nMagnet Mill, Chadderton\n\nRutland Mill, Shaw\n\n1967 Announced the closure of:[20]\n\nAce Mill, Chadderton\n\nHawk Mill, Shaw\n\nSaxon Mill, Droylsden\n\n1968 Courtaulds offered to make a bid for International Paints under attack from Dufay[21]. Courtauld's bid, from its subsidiary Pinchin, Johnson and Associates was successful[22]; the companies became part of a new company, International Paint Company, 83 percent owned by Courtaulds[23]\n\n1974 Produced a booklet to introduce engineers to the range of applications for carbon fibre.[24]\n\n1976 Announced the closure of its Skelmersdale weaving mill.[25]\n\n1978 Sold its American cotton farming subsidiary Delta Pine Lands, of Mississippi.[26]\n\n1979 Sold its Accrington Brick and Tile Co subsidiary to George Armitage and Sons. [27]\n\n1980 Announced the closure of seven mills in its Northern Spinning Division:[28]\n\nCedar Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne\n\nMay Mill, Wigan\n\nIsaac Pearson, Stockport\n\nPremier Mill, Stalybridge\n\nRoyd Mill, Oldham\n\nThrostlebank Mill, Hyde\n\nMoston Mill, Newton Heath\n\n1985 Considered splitting the textiles from the paints and coatings businesses but, instead, made management changes along these lines.\n\n1986 Sold the South African pulp interests.\n\n1989 Announced plans to undo the 1960s mergers by splitting off the textiles business into a separate company. The Courtaulds business would concentrated on marine and decorative paints, cellophane and film, cellulosic fibre, acetates, non-woven fabrics, and composite materials[29]\n\n1990 Announced the closure of:[30]\n\nAtlas Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne\n\nManor Mill, Chadderton\n\nMars Mill, Castleton\n\n1990 Demerged Courtaulds Textiles as a separate listed company supplying, amongst other customers, Marks and Spencer with lingerie[31]\n\n1998 Settled a 5-year dispute with Lenzing of Austria about a new, breathable fibre which Courtaulds called Tencel; both companies used a process licensed from Akzo-Nobel to extract cellulose from wood pulp; Courtaulds and Lenzing agreed to a cross-licencing arrangement. Courtaulds was building a plant at Grimsby to make Tencel[32]\n\n1998 The company planned to split itself in two in order to boots the share price; the fibres and chemicals business would continue under the Courtaulds name; the coatings and sealants business would probably be spun off under a name such as International Coatings[33]\n\n1998 Courtaulds would close it Water Soluble Polymers business, having sold some of the assets of the business to Dow Chemical; the main product, Celacol, had been obtained in the acquisition of British Celanese[34]\n\n1998 Akzo-Nobel made an agreed bid for the company; the share price had already responded very positively to rumours of the approach; Akzo-Nobel indicated that it would spin off the combined fibres and textile businesses of the 2 companies, headed by Gordon Campbell of Courtaulds[35]\n\n1998 Courtaulds Textiles won exclusive rights to the Courtaulds brand name after Akzo-Nobel changed the name of Courtaulds to Akzo-Nobel[36]\n\nPlans announced by Akzo-Nobel to hive off the combined fibres business in a new company Acordis in 1999. Also announced management buyout of plastics and packaging businesses in the UK, previously part of Courtaulds Packaging, as Betts, based in Colchester.[37]\n\nSee Also\n\n[1] Wikipedia\n\n[2] The Real Essex Website\n\nLuvisca\n\nSources of Information"
