Pivot North, in partnership with deChase Miksis Development, was selected to conceptualize and design three prominent parcels within the 13-lot development. There will be a mix of multi-family, commercial office, and retail within the three lots.\n\nAll three projects uniquely address their specific site constraints and opportunities but are all grounded in a rich northwest regionalism design aesthetic. Built with a bold and timeless material palette of wood, metal, and masonry, the buildings echo the environment around them.\n\nProject Status | Area 12 Completed Fall 2023"
