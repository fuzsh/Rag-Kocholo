        "text": "In 2005 the Atlas Mill closed and the Site has lain fallow since. In 2018, the City of Coeur d'Alene purchased the Site in collaboration with Ignite Cda and has been preparing the Site for eventual development by creating a new urban renewal area and funding the waterfront park development and remediation efforts. The intent of the City and Ignite Cda is to transfer areas of land for development in phases over the next couple of years as site development and remediation efforts progress. This strategy allows flexibility to adapt to market demand while still ensuring the key riverfront amenities of the Site are preserved. While overall area configurations are set by the Site Development Standards, within each area there is significant flexibility for developers to propose a range of projects that will both provide a diversity of uses while still ensuring the overall character of the development.\n\nYour Next Home\n\nWelcome to the Atlas Mill Development in the heart of Coeur d’Alene, where a unique blend of modern living and natural beauty comes to life. We proudly present an exceptional opportunity featuring eighteen spacious single-family residences and ten exquisite twin home building sites, meticulously designed to cater to your lifestyle.\n\nFloorplans\n\nOur vision for Atlas Mill is the result of a collaborative effort with ML Architects of Post Falls. Together, we've meticulously crafted three distinct house designs, each thoughtfully tailored to harmonize with the unique character of this vibrant community.\n\nNestled against the picturesque slope of the property, the Single family homes offer the homeowner a tranquil and private backyard sanctuary.\n\nEach of our thoughtfully designed homes spans three levels, offering a perfect balance of functionality and elegance. The main level welcomes you with a spacious garage and the heart of the home—the main living area. Here, you'll find the ideal space for daily living, entertaining, and creating lasting memories.\n\nVenturing upstairs, This level is dedicated to all the bedrooms, ensuring restful nights and a convenient layout for family life. With privacy and convenience in mind, our designs cater to the needs of modern families.\n\nWhat truly sets our homes apart is the lower level. A walk-out basement leads you to a flat backyard, creating an extension of your living space into the outdoors. Whether you're envisioning a cozy retreat, an area for gardening, or a place for children to play."
