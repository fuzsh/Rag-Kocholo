Open to the public from 8 am to sunset every day, this park offers a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. Here, visitors can traverse diverse landscapes, wandering through fields and around ponds, unveiling new vistas with every step. Fishing opportunities abound along the banks of Kearlsey Creek, meandering through the property, while adventurers can launch kayaks or canoes for a scenic paddle to Atlas Millpond. For those with furry companions, the woods welcome you and your four-legged friends—just remember the 6-foot leash and the responsibility to clean up after them.\n\nAdjacent to the park, the recently finished non-motorized Gale Road trail provides seamless access to downtown Goodrich. Prepare to be amazed by the stunning vistas this park has to offer.\n\nFormerly in privately owned, this property became public through a grant from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund along with local matching funds. We’re thrilled to unveil this space for everyone to enjoy. Inside the park entrance, you’ll find a small parking lot for convenience."
