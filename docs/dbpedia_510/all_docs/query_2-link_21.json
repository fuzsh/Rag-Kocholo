        "text": "Opening this fall, our new facility in Blytheville, Arkansas, is the result of decades of experience in the steel industry, bringing together state-of-the-art technology and unrivaled domestic manufacturing capabilities. Spanning 515,000 square feet, the new facility is the largest continuous electric resistance weld (ERW) tube mill in the world, rolling the biggest hollow sections available in North America.\n\nRolled Right Next Door\n\nAtlas Tube’s five state-of-the-art facilities have the shortest cycle times and fastest order turnaround in the industry. We roll more than 1.2 million tons a year at our strategically located plants in Arkansas, Illinois, Alabama, Michigan and Ontario.\n\nDrop-in Rolling and Flexible Scheduling\n\nWe’re always happy to accommodate custom orders to help get you what you need on a timeline that works for your project. Additionally, our customer portal makes it easy to check inventory, view rolling schedules, see available tons in upcoming rollings, and place orders online.\n\nDedicated to Sustainability\n\nWe care about bringing manufacturing back to America, but we also care about keeping the country clean for future generations. That’s why we work continuously to find new ways to recycle, improve manufacturing efficiency, and reduce our use of harmful chemicals and solvents."
