        "text": "Anybody familiar with an Atlas benchtop horizontal mill? I see one available for $200- says it needs cleaning and a motor. I have plenty of motors, and like fix-up projects, if the machine is decent quality.\n\nWere these decent machines? I don't really know doodely about milling machines, but I frequently have a need to fab small brackets and fixtures- mostly aluminum. I am looking for a small lathe as well.\n\nCan you mount a chuck on a horizontal mill in place of a cutter, so you use it like a short lathe?\n\nIf this thing is not totaly worn out and has some tooling, would it be worth dragging home? What should I check?\n\nYour best bet is to go to the website http://www.lathes.co.uk. There you will find a page that has many milling machines. Click on the \"Atlas/Craftsman\". This description is about as objective as you will get.\n\nDuring a thing called World War II I ran one of these mills in a defense shop while in Trade School. My recollection is that it was adequate for work within it's size limits. If the spindle bearings and gibs were properly adjusted it was capable of taking surprisingly heavy cuts. It's usefulness was only determined by the ingenuity of the operater. If the one you are looking at has at least one cutter arbor that would be a plus. Also note if there is a vise. The sliding surfaces(ways)must be checked for wear or scoring on all three axes, especially the x axis or table ways.\n\nIn the end only you can be the one to decide whether or not to buy. My suggestion is to buy. Unless this is a total piece of junk, once you get it home and clean it up you may a diamond in the rough, if not I have no doubt you could recoup your investment.\n\nGood luck and let's see what others have to say\n\nWell, I'm picking this thing up on Saturday! And the price dropped to $150!\n\nSo- we'll see what the heck I've got. At this price, it may just be a learning experience more than being a useful tool.\n\nThe seller says that it has a 1\" arbor for the cutters. Was there any way to mount an end mill? I reckon you would need a way to attach colletts.\n\nGotta get a manual on this thing now...\n\nI just got a reprint of the Series M Atlas bench mills from the guy on eBay who sells all of the comb bound riprints. I am looking for just such a mill myself and will be curious to follow your progress with it. BTW, I'm just a bit South of you in Lynchburg, VA if you suddenly need to get rid of it!\n\nThe Green Frog\n\n***\n\n*\n\n***\n\nIf you count gears (back gears) ... then both. Atlas had some special name fo the alloy they used for these parts, they called it something like alumilite or litealloy or crapalloy or some silly name (maybe somebody out there remembers). They claimed it was like two times stronger than steel and four times tougher than cast iron and Super Man could't bend it and they mined the ore from Batman's shorts, I've just found it kind of breaks and wears out. They cast these parts out of the crapalloy and then chrome plate them, and when the chrome starts cracking and peeling, you know the part is nearing it's expiration date. The back gears are also cast crapalloy, but no plating , too bad, I think the chrome plating would wear better. When ever I engage the back gears for the power feed the noise that comes out sounds like midnight at a turkish whorehouse, constant oiling keeps the din to a minimum. There is a saying... ''it is what it is'' I think this applies. All in all, I think Lynn got a pretty good deal, Makes a great first mill, and once he moves up it will make a good secondary mill to beat stuff up on.\n\nI got the mill AND the matching Atlas Shaper for $300. And both are on the original cast iron stands. Very cool.\n\nThe shaper is an amazing thing- I'd never heard of this type of machine until now. It is in working condition, and I've actually done some useful work with it.\n\nThe mill is fairly complete. It is missing a little piece involved in the crossfeed kickout. Also, the table's t-slots are damaged in 2 areas, but I think I can just avoid these spots with no problem. I'll be completely tearing it down and rebuilding/restoring.\n\nThe problem now is to locate suitable sheaves for the mill and motor. They are detailed here:\n\nhttp://www.hillsgun.com/Atlaspulleydimensions.htm\n\n..in case anybody has a pair of these kicking around the shop...\n\nThere is a good chance that the Atlas mill we have been discussing on this thread is the same one that was restored by Rudi K in a multi-part series for Home Shop Machinist or its sister mag. The whole thing is also supposedly available from the magazine publisher as a 2 hour video for about $60. Does anyone know if this is the same mill and whether the video would be useful? I only saw one or two installments of the print series.\n\nThe Green Frog"
