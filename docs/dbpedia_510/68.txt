Atlas Mill Renovation

Atlas Mill Renovation

425 W. Water Street, Appleton WI

The Atlas Paper Mill was originally constructed in 1878 by Kimberly-Clark Corporation and operated until 1999. Located on the Fox River in the Appleton Flats, this project is part of a larger waterfront development area that includes the Vulcan Heritage Park and the restoration of the Vulcan power plant, now occupied by Fratello's Restaurant. The 2004 renovation converted the 52,000 square-foot former paper mill into a paper museum, home of the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame, and mixed retail/office space at a cost of nearly $5 million. The Atlas Mill was awarded the 2006 Outagamie County Historical Society Historic Preservation award.
