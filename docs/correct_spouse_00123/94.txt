Ruben Studdard recently went through a bitter divorce from his now-former wife Zuri McCants, and while he may have lost his heart, he reportedly lost nothing else in court.

Luckily, the star was smart and signed a prenup agreement before marrying McCants, so after their divorce, she was left only with what she brought to the marriage - nothing.

According to XO Necole, the former couple went through a rough divorce battle where McCants tried to get a legal annulment for the prenup papers, but she didn't succeed.

Studdard met McCants at a Wal-Mart CD signing in 2006 and he thought she was everything he needed. Two years later, they tied the knot in a private ceremony, but unfortunately, their story didn't have a happily ever after.

In 2011, only three years after getting tying the proverbial knot, the unhappy couple filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences as their reason.

And even though they didn't have kids together and the process should have been a smooth one, McCants decided to make her and Studdard's lives complicated.

He didn't have to pay spousal support or alimony and got to keep the house, cars, royalties, pensions, and even the engagement ring he gave to McCants.

Cants alleged that the singer had pressured her to sign the prenup agreement and that she needed it to be nullified by the court.

The judge who was presiding over the case didn't buy McCants' story for a second and she upheld the prenup, giving Studdard everything he came with to the marriage plus all he earned while he was married to her.

He didn't have to pay spousal support or alimony and got to keep the house, cars, royalties, pensions, and even the engagement ring he gave to McCants.

The woman, on the other hand, was left with a 2006 BMW (which Studdard would keep making payments for), a ten-thousand-dollar house settlement, $2,000 for her attorney's fees, and her wedding dress.

Many of Ruben's fans were happy about the settlement, stating that it was clear that McCants was a gold digger and all she was after was Studdard's money.

Getting prenups is practically the norm between celebrities these days. After all, since many of them get married seemingly on impulse, it's only natural for them to protect the fortune they have accumulated through their careers.
