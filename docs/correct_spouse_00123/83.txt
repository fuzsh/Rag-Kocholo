Ruben Studdard and Surata Zuri McCants

Despite their divorce in 2011, this couple had the best of their three years marriage. They met in Atlanta Walmart while Rubben Studdard, then the second season American Idol winner, was signing CDs for fans. He couldnâ€™t take his eyes off Surata Zuri McCants the moment he saw her.

Lost for words after meeting her, Ruben followed her to the toy department and asked for her phone number.
