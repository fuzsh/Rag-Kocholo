        "text": "Here is a List of Celebrity Divorces that have happened within the past year. Some were shocking, others were expected. However, if theres anything celebrities are good at, divorcing certainly will make that list.\n\n5. Ruben Studdard and ex-wife Surata Zuri McCants. Now we haven’t quite heard from Rueben in a while, but if theres one thing he has been successful at in the last year, it’s definitely his divorce. The man came out like a champ, leaving the marriage with pretty much everything he came in with.\n\n4. Kim K. And Kris Humphries. Okay, now lets be real. 75% of America saw this one coming, but who knew it would come so quickly. The reality show superstar and her former NBA husband seperated after just 72 days of marriage! But looks like Kim K has taken some Theraflu to relieve her of the cold divorce….a.k.a. Kanye West.\n\n3. Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. After 7 years of marriage, the couple has called it quits! I feel a little bad for this one especially since there are kids involved and not to mention a large amount of failed relationships on Jennifer Lopez’s end. However, the singer is looking better than ever so watch out Marc Anthony, you may have lost a good one!\n\n2. Heidi Klum and Seal. The super model and singer have “grown apart” according to Seal. The couple’s eight-year marriage ended earlier this year and in all honesty, shocked a lot of people. Although the couple seemed a little weird at first, we all grew to love them together!\n\n1. Kobe and Vanessa Bryant. Now this divorce is one of those “its about time!” splits. This isn’t surprising since Vanessa has accused Kobe of cheating on her 105 times during their marriage! 105 TIMES?!?!?!?! Well honestly, Vanessa came out winning in this divorce getting 3 homes and $75 million from the settlement thanks to no prenup! If anything else did come out of the divorce it has to be Drakes famous line “B*****, You Wasn’t With Me Shootin In The Gym” from the song ‘Stay Schemin.’\n\nCheck Out The Gallery Below!\n\nRELATED: Kobe Bryant’s Wife Wins Big Divorce Settlement"
