        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - June 27, 2008 Studdard, nicknamed the \"Velvet Teddy Bear\" on \"Idol\" for his big frame and sonorous voice, will marry Surata Zuri McCants, his girlfriend of two years, at the Canterbury United Methodist Church in Mountain Brook on Saturday.\n\nHe met his bride-to-be during a CD-signing at a Wal-Mart store in Atlanta in October 2006. The 29-year-old singer says he was struck by McCants' beauty and later tracked her down in the toy department and asked for her telephone number.\n\nStuddard is set to release a new album later this year."
