        "text": "Ruben Studdard, the season two \"American Idol\" winner, faces state and federal property liens after allegedly not paying close to $200,000 in taxes, BlackVoices.com reported.\n\nStuddard, who married Surata Zuri McCants on June 28 and is without a current record deal, owes $21,730 in state income taxes, and $171,920 in unpaid income taxes to the federal government, according to the report. The story cites a lien filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court.\n\nA majority of the unpaid taxes are from 2003 â€” the same year Studdard won \"American Idol.\"\n\nThe state liens were filed July 25, and the federal ones were filed in May."
