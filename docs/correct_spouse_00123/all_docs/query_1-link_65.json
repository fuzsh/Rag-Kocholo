        "text": "Ruben Studdard is coming back to reality TV – but he won’t be singing this time.\n\nThe former American Idol winner will appear on the upcoming season of The Biggest Loser, the weight loss competition program on NBC. Studdard has weighed as much as 455 pounds, according to People Magazine, and gained weight after divorcing his wife Surata Zuri McCants last year.\n\nRuben Studdard launched a career in gospel singing after winning Idol, but has never had the mainstream success of winners like Kelly Clarkson or Carrie Underwood.\n\nPeople quoted Ruben Studdard as saying: “I’ve never had an issue with my weight. [But] my family has a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart-related issues – things I didn’t have to deal with yet because I’m young. But I don’t want to be worried at 40, and if I don’t fix things now, I will be.”\n\nProps to Ruben Studdard for getting his weight in check – but is reality TV the best route to take?"
