The “Velvet Teddy Bear” married his sweetie, Surata Zuri McCants, at Canterbury United Methodist Church in his hometown of Birmingham, Ala., Saturday, People.com reports. Studdard met McCants at a Wal-Mart in Atlanta during a record signing in 2006. He was struck by her beauty and followed her to the store’s toy department, where he asked her for her digits. Studdard, 29, and McCants, 30, picked up their marriage license at the County Probate Office in Columbiana, Ala., a week before the wedding day. “They looked really happy,” an eyewitness said.\n\nOriginally Published: June 30, 2008 at 12:00 a.m."
