        "text": "Post by jamaicantasiaboy on\n\nSunday, July 16, 2006\n\n7/17: Ruben interview part I\n\nBy Rodney Ho | Sunday, July 16, 2006, 06:21 PM\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nI’m going to split the Ruben Studdard interview I did Saturday into three parts since it’s fairly long. His concert was a lot of fun. Not a full house but the faithful did show (more than 1,000) and gave him much deserved love. He was in fine form vocally and his backup band was solid. He did some gospel, a load of covers (“What’s Goin’ On,” “How Can We Mend a Broken Heart,” “Never Too Much”) and even an acoustic set. He brought back “Superstar” from “Idol” days and a lovely acoustic version of “Flying Without Wings.” After a guy proposed to his woman in the audience, Ruben crooned Bryan Adams’ “Heaven.” Strange choice but it worked. He was in a relaxed, joking mood, teasing the front tables about their food, “threatening” to steal some of it away. He threw shoutouts to his family members and said he still thinks when people say “Rooooobe” (as in Ruben), he hears ” boooo!”\n\nHere’s part 1. Part two is here and part three is here\n\nAJC: You spend a lot of time in Atlanta, don’t you?\n\nA lot of my family lives here so I’m always here.\n\nAJC: Who do you have here?\n\nMy mom’s brother lives here. Two of my first cousins. One of my best friends. A lot of people.\n\nAJC: So how often do you come over to Atlanta?\n\nAt least once a month. My manager lives here. [That’s Cedric Evans]\n\nAJC: Is that why you’re doing a concert here. You’re not doing an official tour.\n\nNot right now. They just called to as us to do a show and we did.\n\nAJC: So what are you going to do since it’s a one-off show?\n\nI’m going to have a good time. This is a chance to covers, basically whatever I want to do. I don’t want to confine ourselves. We have this set show we do always.\n\nAJC: You’re going to try different things.\n\nI want to do an acoustic set tonight, just do some other things you know. Have a good time.\n\nAJC: You’ve been out of the spotlight for awhile now. What’s been holding up the album?\n\nI don’t know if you’ve heard man but I’ve been going through a lot.\n\nAJC: That legal case? [His godfather and manager allegedly stole $246,000 from him by taking out credit cards without Ruben’s knowledge and misappropriating funds. An Alabama judge last month rewarded Ruben with $500,000 for the lost funds and $1.5 million in punitive damages.]\n\nThat was an issue. I wanted to take some time off to change my lifestyle as it pertains to my eating habits.\n\nAJC: It looks like you’ve lost some weight.\n\nI’ve lost about 40 pounds. I’ve gone away and learned about proper nutrition.\n\nAJC: It’s hard.\n\nIt’s more costly than it is hard. Honestly, once you change your thinking. I’m a perfectionist at whatever I do. That’s one area where I feel I didn’t have total control. Now I think I’ve got it. Now y’all pray for me, you know. It’s a journey.\n\nAJC: Did you get a nutritionist?\n\nI went to this place called the Duke Diet & Fitness Center [at Duke University in Durham, N.C.] A lot of athletes go there, a lot of famous people go there. I just needed to go somewhere to train myself. [Cedric said he spent about four weeks there, from late May through June]\n\nAJC: Were you feeling bad?\n\nNo. I felt great. I just know I’m about to be in the second half of my life. I’m past 25. It’s time to be concerned. I don’t have any health problems but people who are overweight, at a certain point, that becomes an issue and I don’t want that to become an issue with me. I was an athlete in college and I want to get back to where I was so I can always be healthy and do the job I always love for the rest of my life.\n\nAJC: You don’t want it to be a roller coaster like Luther Vandross.\n\nThat was his thing. This is all about me. I don’t care about fitting into the clothes or anybody’s image of what they think about me. All I’m interested in is my health.\n\nAJC: What sort of exercise and diet regime are you on?\n\nI do cardio twice a day 45 minutes. I totally changed what I do. Treadmill, outdoors, elliptical. 45 minutes twice a day except for show days. I have time like that. I can make my own schedule to take care of myself. Everybody should do it. Not just me. Everybody should take time out to make sure their body is in shape. For real.\n\nAJC: As far as your third album, you’ve been working on it for awhile.\n\nToo long, man. Too long!\n\nAJC: Is the record company getting on your case?\n\nNo. I’m done with it. It comes out September 26. It’s called The Return.\n\nAJC: Has it been that long that you need to call it “The Return”?\n\nI wanted to do that because everywhere I go, people say, ‘Where have you been?’ so I just think it’ll be cooler. Alright. You asked where I was. Here I am. Everybody who loves mainstream music, not gospel music.\n\nAJC: You mean your second album [“I Need an Angel”]?\n\nThat album helped me through a lot of personal situations and a lot of things spiritually. I grew up in the church. Singing R&B is an extension of what I did in church. I always wanted to do a gospel album and Clive [Davis, the famous record producer] gave me the opportunity. And now I’m back with the music the people love. I want to give a chance to touch the fans, show them that I’m just as much a real person as they are. A lot of times people see us on television and think we don’t have problems and go through situations. I’ve been hurt this year, last year by people I love. My godfather stole $250,000 from me.\n\nAJC: That’s horrible.\n\nAJC: These are life situations that celebrities go through as well. That album for me came at a time when I needed an angel in my life. I had a chance to pour out myself to the people. Not as many people who came to my R&B album. I’m cool man. Ruben Studdard is cool.\n\nAJC: Not many gospel albums sell 430,000 copies.\n\nIt’s certified gold. I did that in six weeks. That just don’t happen. I’m blessed, man.\n\nPermalink | Comments (26) | Post your comment |\n\n7/17: Ruben interview part 2\n\nBy Rodney Ho | Sunday, July 16, 2006, 05:46 PM\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nHere’s part two of my interview with Ruben Studdard\n\nAJC: This will be an R&B album obviously\n\nYes, an R&B album.\n\nAJC: Have you shipped a single to radio\n\nIt’s called “Change Me.” Underdogs did it. The second single will probably be “What the Business Is.” Scott Storch’s record. It’s real hot. I think it’s going to drive the album through the roof. I’m really excited about the project.\n\nAJC:Are you ready to do the promotion thing, the touring thing?\n\nThat’s something I’m looking forward to. We don’t get to do with Idol. We go touring as a group. We don’t get to go on tour for ourselves. Even after your album comes out, you’re obligated to do stuff for the show.\n\nAJC: Are you still obligated to do anything for the show.\n\nNo. But if they ask me to do anything, I’m there. They’re the reason I’m here.\n\nAJC: Have they haven’t asked too much from you recently?\n\nI was supposed to be at the finale. I was at the Duke joint getting myself together.\n\nAJC: What’s your reaction to the lawsuit?\n\nIt was closure. In January, I tried to call it off. But the judge brought the case back, wanted to bring it forward, thought it was so malicious. I’ve forgiven him. That’s another thing in myself was be able to let that go. I was having trust issues with people.\n\nAJC: I can’t blame you. He’s so close to you.\n\nI’m glad I came out victorious. The bible said, let God arise and your enemies scatter. I’m good man. The bible is not mine. It’s the lord.’s\n\nAJC; Do you think you’ll get any money out of it?\n\nI don’t even care man. You know what—the thing about it is. People have read the articles and it shows where he damaged my credit. That was because he got credit cards in my name. He’d take $10,000 instead of asking me, ‘Chris [Ruben’s first name] can I have $10,000?” It was so ridiculous. AJC: And he thought he’d not get caught?\n\nI was getting ready to purchase a home when I came here to Atlanta to the Homebank office. I thought you never had credit card. I never had it. I had to pay it off but my credit score was still damaged. But it’s all good.\n\nAJC? Can you start over. Are you clean now?\n\nI’m good dog.\n\nAJC: Have you purchased a house?\n\nMy accountant felt it wasn’t necessary for me to put my money ina $2 million house where I can get a loan. But now we’re doing our thing. I never had the opportunity to go under. I was always working. I was always making money. Though he stole from me, I never felt it. But it was the principle.\n\nAJC: As far as the trust issues, how have you gotten past that?\n\nI just had to let go and just forgive him. You can’t move on without forgiveness. I don’t have to forget the situation. It doesn’t mean forget. It just taught me a lot. It taught me I have to check everybody, not just because they’re family, to make sure my business is straight. I’m just extra anal when it comes to my finances. The difficult thing I trusted him because I was so busy. I don’;t know how many artists get to be in the situation I was in. I didn’t get a break for 18 months straight.\n\nAJC: That was right after Idol, right?\n\nWhen I did the gospel album. I finally got a break.\n\nAJC: You didn’t have the pressures of doing something every single day. Are you feeling more relaxed?\n\nI’m good. I think everything has come together. My band is hot. Same band even before the show. They raised their game up. I feel obliged to bring them along. They’re my friends and family. You wont see anybody who isn’t close to me backstage. I don’t have a big entourage. I don’t do anything but make good music.\n\nAJC: Do you have high expectations for this album?\n\nI want to be the highest seller at J Records ever. But the fans will tell you what they want intheir pocketbooks. If they love it, then they love it. If not, then I had a great time putting it together and I love the music.\n\nPermalink | Comments (1) | Post your comment |\n\n7/17: Ruben interview part III\n\nBy Rodney Ho | Sunday, July 16, 2006, 02:59 PM\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nHere’s the final portion of the Ruben interview I did Saturday at the Mable House Barnes Amphitheatre:\n\nAJC: As you know, Birmingham is the center of the ‘Idol’ Universe. Did you ever have a chance to meet Taylor [Hicks]?\n\nNo. My mom met him. My brother met him.\n\nAJC: Have you seen him on TV?\n\nI saw him twice. I saw him one episode and on the finale. I think he’s a great singer man. I think he’s going to do well. I think people are really attracted to his personality. I think that’s what got me over, that southern charm. I think it’s the same thing that will get Taylor and Bo over. Bo is a rock star. He’s totally different from Taylor and me. Bo is just awesome. He’ll probably be on his Metallica in a couple of years.\n\nAJC: Have you met Bo?\n\nNo. My mom has met him. I just like to be in the background. I don’t have to go to the premieres.\n\nAJC: Are you surprised they finally made Birmingham an audition city?\n\nIt really shocked me it took me so long. I thought after I won, they’d come directly to them.\n\nAJC: They did Greensboro last year.\n\nThe year after Diana DeGarmo, although she lived in Snellville, she was born in Birmingham. Then Bo the next year, still no audtions. Now Taylor won finally and now they get it. They’re going to find some great talent. We don’t play. There are some psychos there.\n\nAJC: Mandisa has been giving some love for you on the tour.\n\nReally? I didn’t know that.\n\nAJC: In New Jersey, she changed the lyrics to one song to mention you.\n\nAwww…\n\nAJC: She hasn’t met you yet?\n\nNo. We haven’t met yet.\n\nAJC: She’s a gospel gal. She relates to you.\n\nI didn’t know that. I heard her sing. It was jazz week. She did it with her shoes off. I remember Paris doing this song, Fever.\n\nAJC: Have you met Paris? You haven’t met any of these guys.\n\nI haven’t met anybody. I take that back. I did a show with Ace. He opened up for me in California.\n\nAJC: Are you surprised Idol is still so popular?\n\nI think as long as people want to have a stake in somebody’s career. I think it’s going to get bigger . People keep trying to copy it. There’s only one Idol. Always imitated, never duplicated.\n\nAJC: No regrets about doing anything.\n\nIt hasn’t hurt me. You wouldn’t be here writing about me.\n\nAJC: Who are some producers you’ve worked with for your current album?\n\nScott Storch. Mario Winans, Pooh Bear. You’ll see him on Making the Band. Underdogs. Ne-Yo.\n\nAJC: Any guests?\n\nNo guests. All me. I just wanted to do my thing. I wanted it to be about Ruben. That’s it.\n\nAJC: There was a lot less intervention from the record company.\n\nThey said do your thing.\n\nAJC: They probably were on your case a lot more the first album.\n\nThis time, they’re a lot more chill.\n\nAJC: What’s the promotion going to be like?\n\nIt’ll be better promotion because Idol is not in the way. I haven’t had a chance to do a radio tour. I want to go all over. I want to make people sick of seeing me. Whoever calls me, I’ll be there. If a country station wants to talk to me, I’ll talk.\n\nAJC: Were you sick of the media at some point?\n\nNo. I like my job, man. This is what I wanted to do. Nobody asked me to audition for Idol or put a gun to my head or ask me to be a professional singer. This is all that comes with it.\n\nAJC: You don’t mind fans coming up to you while you’re at a restaurant.\n\nExcept when I have a fork in my mouth! That could be kind of annoying. Other than that, you can get an autograph from me.\n\nAJC: Why don’t people wait until you’re finished eating?\n\nWhat? What? They love it! (chuckle). But it’s cool. If I saw Janet Jackson in a restaurant, I wouldn’t care if she had a French fry in her mouth. I’d want to speak to her.\n\nAJC: Where do you like to eat around here?\n\nI love Justin’s. [That’s P. Diddy’s restaurant in Buckhead.] Atlanta Fish Market. Trying to think. I’m usually in the studio when I’m here.\n\nAJC: You seem really relaxed. I remember you doing an interview right after “Idol” and you were just tired.\n\nMan. That was an experience. You catch McPhee and Taylor during the tour and see how they feel. Can you do an interview on the bus? I’m sleeping!\n\nAJC: You don’t have that stress on tour, right?\n\nThat’s one thing I learned about being on tour with Idol. It’s not like being on television. If you mess up and the judges don’t catch it. But your fans will pay attention. If I can give them advice, it’s always do your best on stage even if you’re sick. I remember one concert I was asleep right through the concert until Clay was on. I woke up and couldn’t sing. I didn’t see bad press but that was an awful situation that day.\n\nAJC: Have you heard from Clay lately?\n\nWe just kicked with him two weeks ago. We went to Kelly Clarkson’s show in Carolina. I love her show. She come to Atlanta you have to come see her.\n\nAJC: She’s not coming to Atlanta. I saw her at the Fox Theatre last year.\n\nI think this tour is better. You’ve got the staging. If she’s coming anywhere close, you’ve got to see it.\n\nAJC: Did you get a chance to see her?\n\nWe kicked it! We’re familiy man!\n\nAJC: How are things with Fantasia?\n\nShe had a birthday party she call me about. But I had to go home and handle something with my mama.\n\nAJC: She’s got that movie coming out about herself.\n\nEveryone that’s ever been on the show who wanted to do something for herself is doing it.\n\nAJC: Diana DeGarmo is doing Broadway.\n\nThat’s what I’m saying. Work!\n\nAJC: I haven’t heard much from Justin\n\nHe’s got a jazz album that came out. And Josh [Gracin] is doing great on country. And Kim Locke is doing it on the pop charts. We don’t play. George Huff has a great gospel record. You got to open your eyes. I think Paris will be heard, too. And Chris Daughtry. I really think people should take us seriously henceforth and forever more.\n\nAJC: I think people do.\n\nWe don’t play around. And we sell records. They come off the shelves, even before we leave the show.\n\nAJC: I think people respect Idol a lot more now than when you were on.\n\nPermalink | Comments (4) | Post your comment |\n\nwww.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/idol/entries/2006/07/16/"
