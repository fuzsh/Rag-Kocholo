They have been liens placed on all of Studdard's property for unpaid income taxes in 2003 and 2005.\n\nA lawyer for Studdard says the singer is in good shape financially and can afford to pay his outstanding tax bill. Meanwhile, a developer is trying to find out if the liens on Studdard's property might affect the singer's promised investment in a planned downtown Birmingham club bearing his name."
