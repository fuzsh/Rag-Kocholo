And some celebrities actually end up married to their biggest fans. Some of these love stories are tales of regular folks catching the eye of their favorite star; some are of equally famous stars who scored dates with their own celebrity crushes. Keep reading for 22 such love stories—however improbable they may seem. And for stars with surprising family ties, check out Celebrities You Had No Idea Were Related.\n\n1\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes\n\nKatie Holmes used to tell her Dawson's Creek castmates about her crush on the Top Gun movie star, noting that she even had a poster of Tom Cruise on her wall. Then she told Seventeen magazine in 2004 that she \"used to think [she] was going to marry Tom Cruise.\" It was just a short time later in May 2005 that Holmes got her wish and began dating Cruise. The couple was engaged mere weeks later, and Holmes gave birth to their child, Suri, in 2006. Despite Cruise's initial couch-jumping enthusiasm for Holmes, the couple eventually divorced in 2012.
