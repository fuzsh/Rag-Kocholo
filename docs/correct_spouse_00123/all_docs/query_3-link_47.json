        "text": "Ruben Studdard may have had the cleanest divorce that we’ve ever seen, and he has a top-notch prenup to thank for it. The singer filed for divorce from his wife, Surata Zuri McCants, back in November 2011, due to ‘irreconcilable differences’.\n\nInitially, McCants tried to get the judge to nullify the prenup, stating that it was given to her just two days before the wedding and she felt pressured to sign them. The judge dismissed her claim, and McCants basically left with what she came with after the divorce.\n\nStuddard doesn’t have to pay any alimony or spousal support, and he gets to keep their home, his jewelry, pension, royalties, clothing, and cash. McCants got her wedding dress, photo albums, a 2006 BMW (which Studdard will pay off), a $10k property settlement… oh and $2k for attorney fees.\n\nDoes anyone think that the judge should have nullified the prenup?"
