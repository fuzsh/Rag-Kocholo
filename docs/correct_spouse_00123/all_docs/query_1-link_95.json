The details are kind of a blur, but I must take the time out to thank a few people.\n\nFirstly, thanks to all of the linen-clad partygoers who came out to support the 6th Annual Damone Brown B-day Bash up in Buffalo, NY this Saturday. The night was incredible! Another great Get Fresh Production event. And special thanks to the staff at The Stillwater, \"Buffalo Best Upscale Bar\"...you guys were awesome! Ans of course D.T. and the Late Nite Noise fam. If you live in upstate NY and you missed it keep kicking yourself. LOL.\n\nSecondly, I have to give a special shout out to all of my Universoul Circus fam! Yes, believe it or not before the chick was a blogger, she was an elephant-riding showgirl! I got a chance to catch the new show last night and it was amazing! Shout out to Mr. & Mrs. Walker, Deneise, Econuel amd the whole gang. Keep it up!

Fadel remained jailed at the Clark County Detention Center. Fadel also faces multiple felonies, including kidnapping, robbery, battery and conspiracy in the June 16 robbery and beating that left the 29-year-old Walker unconscious on a side street off the Las Vegas Strip. Lt. Clinton Nichols said Walker spent several hours club-hopping late June 15 and early June 16 before \"willingly\" getting into Fadel's black Range Rover with Fadel and the other alleged assailant. \"The suspects knew who Mr. Walker was. He did not know who they were,\" Nichols said Tuesday, and added that Walker \"probably had a little too much to drink.\"\n\nFadel actually moved to my hometown of Buffalo, N.Y. a couple of months ago to take care of his daughter.\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested and 21 children rescued in what the FBI is calling a five-day roundup of networks of pimps who force c...\n\nHundreds of people have been arrested and 21 children rescued in what the FBI is calling a five-day roundup of networks of pimps who force children into prostitution. The Justice Department says it targeted 16 cities as part of its \"Operation Cross Country\" that caps off five years of similar stings nationwide.\n\nIn all, authorities arrested 345 people — including 290 adult prostitutes — during the operation that ended this week. Since 2003, 308 pimps and hookers have been convicted in state and federal courts of forcing youngsters into prostitution, and 433 child victims have been rescued, Mueller said. The cities targeted in this week's sting are: Atlanta; Boston; Dallas; Detroit; Houston; Las Vegas; Los Angeles; Miami; Montgomery County, Md.; Oakland, Calif.; Phoenix; Reno, Nev.; Sacramento, Calif.; Tampa; Toledo, Ohio and Washington.\n\nA teacher has been accused of having sex with eight members of a school baseball team.

The 34-year-old married teacher later approached other members of the team for sex. The incidents allegedly took place both on school premises and at the boys' homes while their parents were out.\n\nShe was discovered when one of the 15-year-old boys at the school, in the town of Trussville, Alabama, told his parents. They alerted the police. Pritchett, who taught at Clay-Chalkville Middle School, has been charged with two counts of sodomy and one count of sexual\n\nabuse. Some of the boys involved are over the age of consent and are not co-operating with police. She faces 20 years in jail if convicted of the sex abuse offences.\n\n--Despite the title of this post, I don't take the topic of child predators lightly at all. And be clear she is a freakin child predator. We need to stop taking this situations for granted when the victims are boys as opposed to girls. These monsters are everywhere, in our schools, neighborhoods and churches and they should be prosecuted to the FULL extent of the law!\n\nAn ex-convict was found guilty Tuesday in the rape and torture of a Columbia University graduate student who survived 19 hours of torture i...\n\nAn ex-convict was found guilty Tuesday in the rape and torture of a Columbia University graduate student who survived 19 hours of torture in which he scalded her with boiling water and attempted to blind her before trying to burn her to death.\n\nRobert Williams was convicted of attempted murder, rape, kidnapping, arson and other charges in the attack, which was so prolonged and agonizing that the victim begged her tormentor to kill her and later tried to kill herself. The verdict followed a gruesome trial that included dramatic testimony from the victim, who said the 31-year-old Williams made her swallow fistfuls of painkillers, ordered her to gouge out her eyes with scissors, sealed her lips with super glue and gagged her with duct tape before torching her apartment.\n\nWilliams, who previously served eight years in prison for attempted murder, could get a life sentence at a hearing set for July 24. The evidence against Williams included DNA from the victim found on a shirt he was wearing when he was arrested and DNA from him on one of the woman's T-shirts. The victim also identified him in court. The woman told teary jurors Williams repeatedly raped and sodomized her, scalded her with boiling water, threw bleach at her eyes in an attempt to blind her and slit her eyelids during the excruciating torture in her upper Manhattan apartment. Tied up and left unconscious to die in a fire her attacker set in her apartment, the woman woke up and used the flames to burn through some of her restraints and escape.\n\nShaquille O'Neal took up 2 minutes of my life that I'll never be able to get back by spitting the CORNIEST freestyle of all time!

The traffic stop and subsequent arrest occurred after Nate's girlfriend made an emergency call to 911, according to TMZ.com, citing that the platinum rapper was following and threatening her life. After officers interviewed both parties on site, Nate Dogg,\n\nborn Nathaniel Hale was arrested for making terrorist threats on his spouse.

Johnson was murdered on May 3, 2006 in a shooting just hours after a performance by T.I. and Yung Joc at Bogart's nightclub. After the show, T.I. and his entourage headed to the Ritz nightclub for an after party, where an altercation with the shooters forced the rapper and his crew to leave.Witnesses said four men followed T.I.'s two vans, then pulled up next to the vehicles and fired, killing Johnson and injuring three others.\"T.I. and his group were in the VIP area,\" said Detective Tim Gormly said. \"The suspects wanted to get in the VIP area and\n\nweren't allowed to.\"\n\nHosea Thomas has a criminal history including drug possession and trafficking convictions. Padron Thomas is a listed sex offender and has been convicted of robbery and rape. He is currently being held in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for an\n\nunrelated drug case.Each brother was charged with murder and seven counts of felonious assault.\n\nESPN’s Page 2 writer Jemele Hill has been suspended from her post after referencing Adolf Hitler in an article about the NBA champion Boston...\n\nESPN’s Page 2 writer Jemele Hill has been suspended from her post after referencing Adolf Hitler in an article about the NBA champion Boston Celtics and the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIn a recent editorial describing why she couldn’t root for the Celtics, Hill—a lifelong Pistons fan—wrote:\n\n\"Rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim.

I want to pay for the balance on the dress.\" The customer at first declined Blige's offer but relented after the singer said, \"I know what it's like to want something and not be able to have it.
