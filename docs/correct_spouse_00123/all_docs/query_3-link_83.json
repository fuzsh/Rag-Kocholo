        "text": "For his professional theater debut, vocalist Ruben Studdard chose \"Ain't Misbehavin,'\" the musical celebration of the life and works of Thomas \"Fats\" Waller, one of the great Harlem Renaissance composers of the 1920s and '30s, a colorful - and rather large - character.\n\n(Waller used to introduce himself as \"my mother's 285 pounds of jam, jive and everythang.\")\n\nThe 30th anniversary tour of \"Ain't Misbehavin' \" - with Studdard in the Waller role - visits the Savannah Civic Center on Sunday.\n\nStuddard, of course, came to national attention in 2003, when he became the second-season winner on that TV juggernaut \"American Idol.\"\n\nHe's made a few albums since then, but \"Ain't Misbehavin' \" (a Tony winner for Best Musical) is the first theater Studdard's done since his high school and college days in Alabama.\n\n\"It was something that was really new to me, but all of the other cast members had acted before, so they really helped me along,\" Studdard explains.\n\nThe rigorous tour schedule - nearly six months of one-nighters - is OK with Studdard, who married his sweetheart Surata Zuri McCants last June. \"This is what I've always wanted to do with my life,\" he says, \"so I don't have any complaints.\"\n\nThe anniversary production was directed by Richard Maltby Jr., who co-wrote and directed the show for its inaugural run in 1978 (the very year, ironically, that Ruben Studdard was born in Birmingham).\n\n\"It was just a great process - I'm so happy that I got to have my first stage experience with these people,\" Studdard enthuses.\n\nHe's the ostensible star, but this five-member cast also includes Frenchie Davis, an \"American Idol\" contestant who didn't win, but went on to great success in productions of \"Rent,\" \"Dreamgirls\" and others.\n\nFor Studdard, \"Idol\" remains a personal best. \"I'm still proud of it,\" he says. \"It's the biggest music show of all time, and I am one of the winners. There's only seven people in the world who can say that right now, and I'm one of them.\"\n\nIt was on the TV show that he earned the nickname \"The Velvet Teddy Bear.\"\n\nOn his few days off, Studdard is in the studio with ace producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, working on a new album.\n\n\"You can just imagine being in the studio with two of the greatest producers of all time,\" he says. \"That, in and of itself, is just a blessing.\n\n\"But they have done a great job of pulling out of me what I think everybody is wanting to hear from me - that's just great music, and me really just singing my heart out. I'm really looking forward to people being able to hear that when it comes out in May.\"\n\nThat's as far ahead as Studdard is looking - that, and the rest of the \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" run.\n\nDown the road, he says, \"I'll be doing whatever God wants me to be doing. He's done such a great job thus far - I don't have any reason not to trust that he will do better in the future.\""
