        "text": "Bernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. (born September 13, 1968) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player and musician. He played his entire 16-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees from 1991 through 2006.\n\nA center fielder, Williams was a member of four World Series championship teams with the Yankees. He ended his career with a .297 batting average, 287 home runs, 1,257 runs batted in (RBI), 1,366 runs scored, and 449 doubles. He was a five-time MLB All-Star and won four Gold Glove Awards. He also won the Silver Slugger Award and American League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award. Known for his consistency and post-season heroics, Williams is one of the most beloved Yankees of all time and his number, 51, was retired by the Yankees in May 2015.\n\nWilliams is also a classically trained guitarist. Following his absence from baseball, he has released two jazz albums. He was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2009.\n\nEarly life\n\nBernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. was born to Bernabé Williams Figueroa Sr., a merchant marine and dispatcher, and Rufina Williams, a retired principal and college professor. The Williams family lived in the Bronx until Bernie was one year old, when they moved to Puerto Rico.\n\nGrowing up, Williams played classical guitar as well as baseball. He was also active in track and field, winning medals at an international meet at the age of 15. At the 1984 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Williams won gold in the 200 metres (m), 400 m, 4 × 100 m relay, and 4 × 400 m relay events for competitors under the age of 17, and the silver medal for the 4 × 100 m relay among competitors younger than 20.\n\nBaseball career\n\nMinor league career\n\nIn 1985, Roberto Rivera, a scout for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB), discovered Williams and Williams’ friend, Juan González. Though Rivera was not interested in González, who he perceived as not taking the game seriously, he wanted to sign Williams. However, Williams was a few months shy of his 17th birthday, when he would become eligible to sign with an MLB team. The Yankees put Williams in a training camp in Connecticut, near the home of scouting director Doug Melvin. The Yankees officially signed Williams on his 17th birthday.\n\nWhile playing in minor league baseball, Williams took a course on biology at the University of Puerto Rico, and considered undertaking a pre-medical track as an undergraduate student. Deciding that he could not excel at baseball and medicine at the same time, Williams decided to focus on baseball. Playing for the Yankees’ Double-A team in Albany, he continued to develop his athletic skills – particularly as a switch hitter. Although viewed as a great prospect by Yankee management, his rise to the Majors was delayed by the solid outfield that the team had developed in the early 1990s.\n\nMajor league baseball\n\nWilliams managed to break into the majors in 1991 to replace the injured Roberto Kelly for the second half of that season. He batted .238 in 320 at bats. He was demoted to the minors until Danny Tartabull was injured, and Williams earned his stay at center by putting up solid numbers.\n\nWilliams had become the regular Yankees center fielder by 1993. However, Williams got off to a slow start that season, and Yankees’ owner George Steinbrenner, impatient with Williams, insisted that Gene Michael, the team’s general manager, trade him. Michael discussed trading Williams for Larry Walker with the Montreal Expos, but did not make the trade. In his first full season with the Yankees, Williams had a .268 batting average.\n\nBuck Showalter helped keep him with the Yankees through 1995, when George Steinbrenner sought to trade him. Steinbrenner was frustrated by the team’s difficulty in placing him in any of the traditional baseball player molds. He had good speed, but rarely stole bases. In center, he was highly capable at tracking down fly balls and line drives, but had a weak throwing arm. He was a consistent hitter, but only had mild home run power. Throughout the early 1990s he hit in the middle of the order as management tried to figure out where his best fit was.\n\n1995–1998\n\nIn 1995, Steinbrenner again considered trading Williams, this time to the San Francisco Giants for Darren Lewis. The Yankees kept Williams, who had a breakout season. He hit 18 home runs and led the team in runs, hits, total bases and stolen bases. Williams continued his hot hitting into the postseason, leading the Yankees with a .429 batting average in the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners.\n\nAfter continuing to improve in 1996, Williams again showcased his skills to the baseball world in the postseason. He batted .467 in the ALDS against Texas and played a sparkling center field. He picked up where he left off in the ALCS against Baltimore, belting an 11th-inning walk-off homer in Game 1. Ending with a .474 ALCS average and two homers, he was named the ALCS MVP. Williams collected just four hits in the 1996 World Series but his 4 RBI led the Yankees and a clutch homer in the eighth inning of Game 3 helped capture the team’s first championship since 1978.\n\nFollowing the 1997 season, Williams again was the subject of trade rumors, this time involving the Detroit Tigers. According to The New York Times sportswriter Murray Chass, Williams was nearly dealt to the Tigers for a package of young pitchers including Roberto Durán and first round draft pick Mike Drumright. Tigers general manager Randy Smith believed a deal had been reached and an official announcement was close, but Yankees general manager Bob Watson denied that was the case, and Williams remained a Yankee. Watson also discussed Williams with the Chicago Cubs in a potential trade involving Lance Johnson.\n\nDuring the 1998 season, in which the Yankees went 114–48 to set a then American League regular season record, Williams finished with a .339 average, becoming the first player to win a batting title, Gold Glove award, and World Series ring in the same year.\n\n1999–2004\n\nAfter the 1998 season, Williams signed a seven-year, $87.5-million contract with the Yankees, one of the largest in baseball at the time. The Boston Red Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks also bid for Williams on the free agent market. For the length of the contract, the Yankees made the playoffs every single year, and as a result Williams continued to add to his postseason statistics, placing in the top 10 of various career postseason categories.\n\n2005\n\nThe last year covered by his contract, 2005, proved to be a difficult one. He started 99 games in center field and 22 games as designated hitter, but his already weak arm was highlighted as his fielding and batting abilities considerably weakened. He had a career-worst .321 OBP and batting average on balls in play (.274). As expected, the Yankees announced on August 2, 2005, that they would not pick up the $15 million option on Williams’ contract for the 2006 season, opting to pay a $3.5 million buyout instead. In December Williams was offered arbitration by team general manager Brian Cashman to allow an additional month for negotiation. On December 22, the Yankees re-signed Williams to a 1-year, $1.5 million contract.\n\n2006\n\nIn 2006, Williams saw a good amount of playing time in the corner outfield spots with both Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield out with wrist injuries, and did spot duty in center field on days when starting center fielder Johnny Damon was given time off to rest, playing more than was expected when he signed his one-year extension with the Yankees in 2006.\n\nWilliams played for Puerto Rico in the 2006 MLB World Baseball Classic, joining Carlos Delgado, Carlos Beltrán, Mike Lowell, Javier Vázquez, and José Vidro amongst others representing the island possession in a team managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo.\n\nOn July 26, 2006, Williams got his 2,300th career hit, becoming the 11th active player in the Majors with 2,300 or more career hits. Williams continued to climb the Yankees record books by hitting his 443rd career double on August 16, 2006, surpassing then-bench coach Don Mattingly for second-most as a Yankee. For the year, he walked only 7.3% of the time, a career-worst.\n\n2008\n\nAfter two years of inactivity, Williams returned to action playing for the Gigantes de Carolina in the Puerto Rico Baseball League (formerly LBPPR) interested in gauging his condition prior to a possible participation in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. MLB.com reported on December 30, 2008 that Williams had injured his quad while playing for Carolina and may not be able to play in the World Baseball Classic for Puerto Rico.\n\nOn February 19, 2009 Williams worked out with the Yankees at the team’s spring training complex. Williams hinted that if he performs well in the World Baseball Classic he might consider returning to the Yankees. Williams, a fan favorite with the Yankees during the Joe Torre era, still has several friends and former teammates in pinstripes.\n\nOut of contract\n\nWilliams’ contract expired at the end of the 2006 season. He had hoped to return to the Yankees in 2007 and was willing to accept a role as a back-up outfielder and pinch hitter. The Yankees offered Williams an invitation to spring training as a non-roster invitee, giving him a chance to compete for a job. Williams, however, wanted a guaranteed roster spot and declined the invitation.\n\nOn September 21, 2008, Williams made his first return to Yankee Stadium since 2006 for the ceremonies preceding the final game at the stadium. He was the last former player to be introduced and received a standing ovation that lasted a minute and 42 seconds.\n\nIn March 2009 he played for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic, going 0-for-5 with two walks; after the series concluded, he expressed interest in playing in the Major Leagues again.\n\nThough he would not appear in a Major League Baseball game after 2006, Williams did not officially retire until 2015. At the February 2011 retirement press conference for Andy Pettitte, Williams acknowledged that his career was over and stated that he would officially announce his retirement soon thereafter. On April 22, 2015, it was announced that Williams would officially retire on April 24, 2015, with the Yankees.\n\nCareer perspective\n\nAs of 2013, he holds the career postseason record for runs batted in (80). He is also second all-time for postseason home runs (22), doubles (29), total hits (128), total bases (223), and runs scored (83), and third in post-season games played (121). Standing on Yankee all-time lists as of the beginning of the 2008 season:\n\n2nd all-time in doubles\n\n4th all-time in walks\n\n5th all-time in hits\n\n5th all-time in extra-base hits\n\n6th all-time in home runs\n\n6th all-time in RBIs\n\nWilliams appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot for the first time in 2012. He received 55 votes for 9.6%. The next year, Williams received 19 votes (3.3%). Since he received votes on fewer than 5% of ballots, Williams will not be eligible to appear on future ballots.\n\nThe Yankees announced in May 2014 that they would honor Williams with a plaque in Monument Park during the 2015 season. On February 16, 2015, the Yankees also announced that they would be retiring Williams’ number 51. On May 24, the Yankees unveiled Williams’s plaque and retired his number in a ceremony at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMusic career\n\nA classically trained guitarist, Williams plays and composes music with influences that include jazz, classical, pop, Brazilian, and Latin sounds. Following his career with the New York Yankees, he studied guitar and composition for a year at the State University of New York at Purchase in preparation for his album, Moving Forward.\n\nWilliams signed with Paul McCartney’s publishing company, MPL Communications, and his major label debut, The Journey Within, was released on June 22, 2003. In addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar, Williams composed seven songs for the album. Tracks like “La Salsa En Mi” and “Desvelado” mix Bernie’s love of jazz with the sophisticated Latin rhythms of his Puerto Rican heritage.\n\nThe first single was a remix of his “Just Because”, featuring David Benoit. Other highlights include Williams’ heartfelt tribute to his father, “Para Don Berna”, a reworking of the Baden Powell song, “Samba Novo”, and “La Salsa En Mi”, featuring background vocals from 2003 Grammy Award winner Rubén Blades and salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa. Also joining Williams is an all-star ensemble of musicians including multiple Grammy-winning banjo player Béla Fleck, keyboardist David Sancious, percussionist Luis Conte, bassist Leland Sklar, guitarist Tim Pierce, and drummers Kenny Aronoff and Shawn Pelton, among others.\n\nWilliams’ second major album, Moving Forward, was released on April 14, 2009 under the Reform Records label. The album features fourteen tracks and includes some collaborative tracks with other artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, Jon Secada, and Dave Koz. Williams was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Moving Forward.\n\nIn 2010, Williams participated in the World Rhythms Tour with Basia. On July 18, 2010 he performed at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games opening ceremony.\n\nIn July 2011, Williams’ book, Rhythms of the Game, co-authored by Williams, Dave Gluck and Bob Thompson, with a foreword by Paul Simon, was to be published by Hal Leonard Publishing.\n\nWilliams was featured on the November/December 2011 cover of Making Music Magazine to discuss his life and career in music. Williams received his Bachelor of Music from the Manhattan School of Music on May 13, 2016.\n\nDiscography\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nBernie’s love of music shines through in his philanthropy efforts with Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit organization that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. Little Kids Rock honored the New York Yankees icon with the 2010 “Big Man of the Year” award at the annual Right to Rock celebration. Williams performed onstage with students and signed some guitars to be auctioned. With the money he helped raise, Williams delivered instruments to a school in the Bronx and gave the students a lesson in music and life.\n\nIn August 2015 Bernie Williams and Brandon Steiner made a surprise visit to Camp Adventure, and they helped revive the music program of KiDS NEED MORE, a charitable organization dedicated to creating camping experiences for children, families & young adults coping with cancer and life-threatening illnesses. The surprise visit aired September 15, 2015 on the YES Network on The Hook-Up: Camp Adventure.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBernie married wife Waleska on February 23, 1990. They live in Armonk, New York and have three children: Bernie Jr., Beatriz, and Bianca. One song on Bernie’s 2009 release “Moving Forward” is named after Beatriz (Lullaby for Beatriz). This song is performed by Bernie Williams and his brother, Hiram Williams on the cello. This song was recorded in Puerto Rico at the Alpha Recording Studios.\n\nhttp://wikipedia.thetimetube.com/?q=Bernie+Williams&lang=en\n\nAlain Leroy Locke (September 13, 1885 – June 9, 1954) was an American writer, philosopher, educator, and patron of the arts. Distinguished as the first African American Rhodes Scholar in 1907, Locke was the philosophical architect —the acknowledged “Dean\"— of the Harlem Renaissance. As a result, popular listings of influential African-Americans have repeatedly included him. On March 19, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. proclaimed: “We’re going to let our children know that the only philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke came through the universe.”\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAlain Locke was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 13, 1885 to Pliny Ishmael Locke (1850–1892) and Mary Hawkins Locke (1853–1922). In 1902, he graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia, second in his class. He also attended Philadelphia School of Pedagogy.\n\nIn 1907, Locke graduated from Harvard University with degrees in English and philosophy, and was honored as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and recipient of the prestigious Bowdoin Prize. After graduation, he was the first African-American selected as a Rhodes Scholar (and the last to be selected until 1960). At that time, Rhodes selectors did not meet candidates in person, but there is evidence that at least some selectors knew he was African-American. On arriving at Oxford, Locke was denied admission to several colleges, and several Rhodes Scholars from the American South refused to live in the same college or attend events with Locke. He was finally admitted to Hertford College, where he studied literature, philosophy, Greek, and Latin, from 1907–1910. In 1910, he attended the University of Berlin, where he studied philosophy.\n\nLocke wrote from Oxford in 1910 that the “primary aim and obligation” of a Rhodes Scholar “is to acquire at Oxford and abroad generally a liberal education, and to continue subsequently the Rhodes mission [of international understanding] throughout life and in his own country. If once more it should prove impossible for nations to understand one another as nations, then, as Goethe said, they must learn to tolerate each other as individuals”.\n\nTeaching and scholarship\n\nLocke received an assistant professorship in English at Howard University in 1912. While at Howard, he became a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.\n\nLocke returned to Harvard in 1916 to work on his doctoral dissertation, The Problem of Classification in the Theory of Value. In his thesis, he discusses the causes of opinions and social biases, and that these are not objectively true or false, and therefore not universal. Locke received his PhD in philosophy in 1918.\n\nLocke returned to Howard University as the chair of the department of philosophy. During this period, he began teaching the first classes on race relations, leading to his dismissal in 1925. After being reinstated in 1928, Locke remained at Howard until his retirement in 1953. Locke Hall, on the Howard campus, is named after him.\n\nLocke promoted African-American artists, writers, and musicians, encouraging them to look to Africa as an inspiration for their works. He encouraged them to depict African and African-American subjects, and to draw on their history for subject material.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance and the “New Negro”\n\nLocke was the guest editor of the March 1925 issue of the periodical Survey Graphic titled “Harlem, Mecca of the New Negro”, a special on Harlem and the Harlem Renaissance, which helped educate white readers about its flourishing culture. In December of that year, he expanded the issue into The New Negro, a collection of writings by African Americans, which would become one of his best known works. A landmark in black literature (later acclaimed as the “first national book” of African America), it was an instant success. Locke contributed five essays: the “Foreword”, “The New Negro”, “Negro Youth Speaks”, “The Negro Spirituals”, and “The Legacy of Ancestral Arts”.\n\nLocke’s philosophy of the New Negro was grounded in the concept of race-building. Its most important component is overall awareness of the potential black equality; no longer would blacks allow themselves to adjust themselves or comply with unreasonable white requests. This idea was based on self-confidence and political awareness. Although in the past the laws regarding equality had been ignored without consequence, Locke’s philosophical idea of The New Negro allowed for fair treatment. Because this was an idea and not a law, its power was held in the people. If they wanted this idea to flourish, they were the ones who would need to “enforce” it through their actions and overall points of view.\n\nWhile his own writing was sophisticated philosophy, and therefore not popularly accessible, he saw himself as inspiring others in the movement who became more broadly known, like Zora Neale Hurston.\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nLocke was a member of the Bahá'í Faith and declared his belief in Bahá'u'lláh in 1918. It was common to write to ‘Abdu'l-Bahá to declare one’s new faith, and Locke received a letter, or “tablet”, from ‘Abdu'l-Bahá in return. When 'Abdu'l-Bahá died in 1921, Locke enjoyed a close relationship with Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bahá'í Faith. Shoghi Effendi is reported to have said to Locke, “People as you, Mr. Gregory, Dr. Esslemont and some other dear souls are as rare as diamond.”\n\nSexual orientation\n\nLocke was gay, and may have encouraged and supported other gay African-Americans who were part of the Harlem Renaissance. However, he was not fully public in his orientation and referred to it as his point of “vulnerable/invulnerability”, taken to mean an area of risk and strength in his view.\n\nDeath, influence and legacy\n\nAfter his retirement from Howard University in 1953, Locke moved to New York City. He suffered from heart disease, and after a six-week illness died at Mount Sinai Hospital on June 9, 1954.\n\nLocke was cremated, and his remains turned over to Dr. Arthur Fauset, an anthropologist who was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Fauset was Locke’s close friend, and executor of his estate. Fauset died in 1983, and the remains were given to his friend, Reverend Sadie Mitchell. Mitchell ministered at African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia. Mitchell retained the ashes until the mid-1990s, when she asked Dr. J. Weldon Norris, a professor of music at Howard University, to take the ashes to Washington, D.C. The ashes then resided at Howard University’s Moorland–Spingarn Research Center until 2007. Concerned that the human remains were not properly cared for, the ashes were given to Howard University’s W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which had extensive experience handling human remains. Locke’s ashes, which were stored in a plain paper bag in a simple round metal container, were transferred to a more appropriate small funerary urn. They were locked in a safe to keep them secure.\n\nHoward University officials initially considered having Locke’s ashes buried in a niche at Locke Hall on the Howard campus, similar to the way that Langston Hughes’ ashes were interred at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City in 1991. But Kurt Schmoke, the university’s legal counsel, was concerned about setting a precedent that might lead to other burials at the university. After an investigation revealed no legal problems to the plan, university officials decided the remains should be buried off-site. At first, thought was given to burying Locke beside his mother, Mary Hawkins Locke. But Howard officials quickly discovered a problem: She had been interred at Columbian Harmony Cemetery in Washington, D.C., but that cemetery closed in 1959 and her remains transferred to National Harmony Memorial Park—which failed to keep track of them. (She was buried in a mass grave along with 37,000 other unclaimed remains from Columbian Harmony.)\n\nHoward University eventually decided to bury Alain Locke’s remains at historic Congressional Cemetery, and African American Rhodes Scholars raised $8,000 to purchase a burial plot there. Locke was interred at Congressional Cemetery on September 13, 2014. His tombstone reads:\n\n1885-1954\n\nHerald of the Harlem Renaissance\n\nOn the back of the headstone is a nine-pointed Bahá'í star (representing Locke’s religious beliefs); a Zimbabwe Bird, emblem of the nation Locke adopted as a Rhodes Scholar; a lambda, symbol of the gay rights movement; and the logo of Phi Beta Sigma, the fraternity Locke joined. In the center of these four symbols is an Art Deco representation of an African woman’s face set against the rays of the sun. This image is a simplified version of the bookplate that Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas designed for Locke. Below the bookplate image are the words “Teneo te, Africa” (“I hold you, my Africa”).\n\nInfluence and legacy\n\nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Locke on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. Similarly, Columbus Salley’s book “The Black 100” named Locke as the 36th most influential African-American.\n\nSchools named after Locke include:\n\nAlain L. Locke Elementary School PS 208 in South Harlem\n\nThe Locke High School in Los Angeles\n\nThe Alain Locke Public School is an elementary school in West Philadelphia\n\nAlain Locke Charter Academy in Chicago\n\nAlain Locke Elementary School in Gary, Indiana\n\nMajor works\n\nIn addition to the books listed below, Locke edited the “Bronze Booklet” series, a set of eight volumes published by Associates in Negro Folk Education in the 1930s. He also reviewed literature written by African Americans in journals such as Opportunity andPhylon. His works, inter alia, include:\n\nThe New Negro: An Interpretation.

In the years following Idol, Studdard has released six studio albums, including his platinum-selling debut, Soulful, and the top-selling gospel follow-up, I Need an Angel. He is most well known for his recording career, which has produced hits including “Flying Without Wings”, “Sorry 2004”, and “Change Me”, but he has also segued into television and stage work. Most notably, he toured with Robin Givens in the comedy-drama Heaven I Need a Hug and in 2008 starred as Fats Waller in a national tour revival of Ain’t Misbehavin’, which spawned a Grammy-nominated soundtrack.\n\nStuddard most recently appeared on the fifteenth season of The Biggest Loser. He is signed to Verve Records and released his newest album, Unconditional Love, on February 4, 2014.\n\nEarly life\n\nStuddard was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to American parents, while his father was stationed there with the U.S. Army, and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. The youngest son of two teachers, at the age of three he sang for the first time at the Rising Star Baptist Church in his hometown of Birmingham. He continued singing gospel in church, performing solos as a child while his mother sang in the local choir. While at Huffman High School, he played football for which he received a scholarship to Alabama A&M University. While at Alabama A&M he joined the Omicron Delta chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the men’s music fraternity of America.\n\nAfter growing up listening to his mother’s Donny Hathaway albums, Fred Hammond, and gospel music, Studdard began to pursue a career in the music industry, majoring in voice studies at Alabama A&M. He sang with Just a Few Cats, a popular local Birmingham jazz and R&B band founded by members of Ray Reach’s UAB Jazz Ensemble, along with other local musicians. Year later, Studdard stated: “A lot of people don’t realize how hard I was trying to get into the business before American Idol. I was making demos and just working so hard.” A back-up singer from Just a Few Cats asked him to accompany her to Nashville, Tennessee for an audition on the 2003 second season of American Idol.\n\nAmerican Idol\n\nWhen auditioning, Studdard sang Stevie Wonder’s “Ribbon in the Sky”. This guided him to being one of the local finalists. On American Idol, he impressed viewers with his performances of the Leon Russell/Bonnie Bramlett song “Superstar” (best known as a hit for The Carpenters) and the Peabo Bryson/Regina Belle duet “A Whole New World”; during his time on the show, Studdard received praise from music legends such as Lionel Richie, Neil Sedaka, Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, Luther Vandross, and Gladys Knight.\n\nDuring the televised competition, Studdard gained the nickname “Velvet Teddy Bear” and was noted for his shirts printed with “205”, the telephone area code of his hometown of Birmingham. Studdard also did a cover version of “For All We Know”, originally recorded by Donny Hathaway, whose music he grew up with.\n\nHe won the contest over runner-up Clay Aiken by only 134,000 votes out of 24,000,000 cast in the May 2003 finale, becoming the second American Idol winner.\n\nAlabama Governor Bob Riley declared March 11, 2003 as “Ruben Studdard Day”.\n\nPerformances and results\n\n^Note 1 Due to Corey Clark’s disqualification, the Top 9 performances became Top 8 when no one was eliminated.\n\n^Note 2 When Ryan Seacrest announced the results for this particular night, Studdard was among the Bottom 2 but declared safe, as Trenyce was eliminated.\n\nCareer\n\n2003–2004:\n\nSoulful\n\nStuddard released his first single, a cover of Westlife’s “Flying Without Wings” (which he had sung on the show’s finale), produced by The Underdogs and Babyface, a month later in June 2003. Fueled largely by sales, it debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. In December 2003, advance orders for his album Soulful topped the one million mark before it was released into stores. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart that month, selling over 400,000 copies in its first week and attaining the second highest first-week sales of any American Idol winner. The single “Sorry 2004” from this album found substantial airplay, reaching number nine in the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Billboard R&B singles chart. Studdard received a Grammy Award nomination in December 2003 for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for “Superstar”, nominated with his idol Luther Vandross (Vandross won that category). In March 2004, Ruben won the NAACP Outstanding New Artist award.\n\n2004–2005:\n\nI Need an Angel\n\nStuddard released the gospel album I Need an Angel on November 23, 2004. The title track and first single “I Need an Angel” was a cover of a 2002 single performed by R&B singer Daniel DeBourg and written by R. Kelly. The album sold over 96,000 copies in its first week, it also entered the Gospel charts at number one, opened at number twenty on the Billboard 200 chart, it since has sold over 500,000 copies. It was also number one on the 2005 Billboard Year-End Gospel Albums Chart. As of June 2007, Studdard is the fifth-best selling American Idol performer with more than 2.4 million albums sold in the U.S.\n\nIn March 2005, Studdard filed a lawsuit against his godfather and business advisor Ronald Edwards. The suit alleges that Edwards ran up $156,000 on Studdard’s credit cards and stole $90,000 from his checking account. Edwards filed a countersuit. On June 15, 2006, Studdard was awarded $500,000 for personal losses and another $1.5 million in punitive damages.\n\nBetween his second and third albums, Studdard began a diet and fitness program to deal with his weight, out of concern for a family history of diabetes and hypertension resulting in his losing over 70 pounds on a vegetarian diet.\n\nIn 2004, Ruben Studdard made a cameo in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed singing a cover of Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Shining Star”.\n\n2006–2008:\n\nThe Return\n\nStuddard’s third album, The Return was released in October 2006; it goes back to his R&B roots, but is different from his previous efforts. Studdard collaborated with the artist Ne-Yo on this album, along with a variety of producers. The single “Change Me” was released ahead of the album. The Return sold 71,000 copies in its first week to open at number eight on the Billboard 200 album chart, but sales declined rapidly after that, not approaching those of his earlier albums. However, Studdard did have good success on the Urban Contemporary chart with “Change Me” (which reached number one) and its successor “Make Ya Feel Beautiful”. Studdard continued to tour, saying he would play a variety of music: “Coming out to my show is like coming to my house. I’ll play the songs I love. It’s like a party. For me, a party has all different types of music happening.”\n\nStuddard appeared on the finale of American Idol season 6 in May 2007. He spent a few weeks touring with Robin Givens in the comedy-drama Heaven I Need a Hug and prepared to take on the role of Fats Waller in a national tour of Ain’t Misbehavin’ in 2008. The tour is scheduled to begin November 17, 2008 in Atlanta, GA and end May 14, 2009 in Syracuse, NY.\n\nIn December 2007, Studdard had been dropped from his record company, J Records, due to poor sales of The Return and “[falling] short of expectations”. He remained under contract with 19 Recordings, however. As such he was assigned the high-profile position of performing the American Idol season 7 farewell song, a recording of Kenny Loggins’ “Celebrate Me Home”, in a new version produced by Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam.\n\nStuddard performed “Celebrate Me Home” live on May 20, 2008, at the Nokia Theatre for the first night of the two-night Grand Finale of American Idol’s seventh season.\n\n2009–2010:\n\nLove Is\n\nStuddard was featured in the music video for gospel singer Deitrick Haddon’s “Love Him Like I Do” along with Gospel duo Mary Mary.\n\nStuddard announced that his next album, to be released May 19, 2009, would be released on Sony Music offshoot Hickory Records. The new album, entitled Love Is, was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The first single off Love Is is the ballad “Together”, which was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Phillip Taj Jackson and Martin Kleveland, produced by StarGate & Martin K. For the album, he was inspired by 2008 marriage Surata Zuri McCants.\n\nHe performed his new single “Together” on American Idol season 8 on March 26, 2009.\n\nLove Is was released on May 19, 2009 to mostly positive reviews. The album, which features a mix of covers and original songs, sold 15,200 units in its first week to debut at number 36 on the Billboard 200, number five on Independent Albums and number eight on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\nStuddard appeared with the “David Foster and Friends” 10 city tour beginning October 21, 2009 in Chicago, Illinois and ending November 8, 2009 in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nA fifth album, Playlist: The Very Best of Ruben Studdard was released on January 26, 2010 by Sony’s Legacy Recordings.\n\nStuddard returned to the American Idol stage on March 31, 2010 to perform his latest single “Don’t Make ‘Em Like U No More”. In his on camera interview with Ryan Seacrest after his performance, he said that he would be touring with Clay Aiken in the summer.\n\nStuddard and Aiken brought their “Timeless” tour to cities in the US and Canada beginning in Asheville, North Carolina on July 23, 2010 and ending in Biloxi, Mississippi on August 14. Instead of a concert focusing on each singers recordings, Studdard and Aiken opted for a variety show format covering medleys of songs from the 1960s to the 1990s with a few solos and interspersed with comedy bits.\n\n2010–2013:\n\nLetters from Birmingham\n\nIn 2011, Studdard signed with Shanachie Entertainment. His first album for the label and fifth release overall, Letters from Birmingham, was released in March 2012.\n\nA concept album that traces a relationship through a series of romantic letters, Letters from Birmingham received mostly positive reviews, especially for his duet with Chrisette Michele, “Do It Right”, which was praised as “sublime” and “tantalizing”. The album also included covers of Bobby Brown’s “Rock Wit'cha” and “Pure Imagination” from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, recast as a love song. Since its release, “Letters from Birmingham” has sold 22,000 copies, and the lead single, “June 28 (I’m Single)”, which referenced his marriage and subsequent divorce, reached the top 20 of Billboard’s urban charts.\n\n2013–present:\n\nThe Biggest Loser\n\nand\n\nUnconditional Love\n\nStuddard joined the cast of fifteenth season of the NBC weight loss competition show The Biggest Loser, and was credited as its first ever celebrity contestant. At 6'3 and 462 pounds, Studdard had the highest starting weight and BMI of the entire cast. A member of the show’s Red Team, Studdard was first eliminated in the fourth week after he failed to make his weight loss goal. However, because opposing coach Jillian Michaels had given her team caffeine pills in violation of the rules, Studdard’s elimination was voided and he returned before once again being eliminated during the competition’s eighth week.\n\nAt the show’s finale on February 4, 2014 (which coincided with the release of Studdard’s newest album, Unconditional Love), it was revealed that he had lost a total of 119 pounds for an ending weight of 343 pounds. Studdard credited the weight loss for improving his ability to perform onstage. During the finale, Studdard also performed his new album’s lead single, “Meant to Be”, accompanied by the song’s cowriter and producer, David Foster, on piano.\n\nUnconditional Love is Studdard’s sixth studio album and first with his new label, Verve Records. Foster, who has won 16 Grammy Awards, was the executive producer of the disc, which primarily consists of covers of love songs along with two originals, including “Meant to Be”. Studdard has called it “the album that everybody expected from me when I won American Idol.” The album features collaborations with Stevie Wonder, Lalah Hathaway, and Eric Benet, and includes covers of songs originally performed by artists such as Paul McCartney, Donny Hathaway, Bonnie Raitt, Marvin Gaye, and Peabo Bryson. Since its release, the album has received some of Studdard’s best reviews of his career. According to critics, the album “finds Studdard at the top of his game vocally” and he hits his stride, “exuding grace, confidence and class” as he successfully positions himself as a “stylish crooner.“ Unconditional Love debuted at #46 on the Billboard 200 and #7 on Billboard’s R&B Albums chart.\n\nStuddard is also currently preparing for a 2014 tour with his collaborator, Lalah Hathaway, and has said he is planning on releasing a Christmas album at the end of the year.\n\nActing\n\nStuddard has worked as an actor in several roles, including single-episode appearances on the television series 8 Simple Rules, Life on a Stick, All of Us, and Eve, as well as a cameo appearance in the film Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. He has also appeared on a television commercial for a Birmingham-area Kia dealer.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of One on One as himself & in an episode of All of Us as an older Bobby. He also appeared in the 8 Simple Rules episode where CJ’s dad comes; he played a delivery boy whom CJ mistakes for his father. He greets him by hugging him and saying \"You have always been my idol”, referring to his win on Idol. Studdard also appeared on an episode of Eve as Paul, Janie’s younger brother who has a huge crush on Shelly.\n\nStuddard headlined the revival tour of Ain’t Misbehavin’, starring alongside fellow American Idol season 2 alumni Trenyce and Frenchie Davis. Starring as Fats Waller, Studdard received positive reviews and was part of the cast recording album released by Rhino Records on January 13, 2009.\n\nAdvocacy\n\nStuddard’s love of music led him to create The Ruben Studdard Foundation for the Advancement of Children in the Music Arts. The foundation’s mission statement says their aim is “to promote the essential role of the arts in education through learning initiatives for the development of students in the Greater Birmingham Area.”\n\nStuddard has signed on as an official spokesperson for “Be Sickle Smart”, a nationwide grassroots health-education program aimed at increasing awareness of iron overload among people living with sickle-cell disease.\n\nPersonal life\n\nStuddard met Surata Zuri McCants in October 2006, when he was signing CDs at a Wal-Mart in Atlanta. On June 28, 2008, Studdard married McCants in a short, private ceremony in Mountain Brook, Alabama.\n\nOn November 16, 2011, Studdard’s attorney announced that Studdard was in the process of a divorce. “Ruben Studdard and Zuri McCants Studdard have separated, and they are in the process of seeking a dissolution of their marriage”, said Byron Perkins. Studdard’s divorce was finalized in April 2012.\n\nStuddard received an honorary Master of Arts degree from his Alma Mater (where he received a Bachelors in Vocal Studies), Alabama A&M, at their December 2015 commencement ceremony.\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAmerican Music Awards\n\nBET Awards\n\nBillboard Music Awards\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nImage Awards\n\nSoul Train Awards\n\nTeen Choice Awards\n\n2004, Favorite Male R&B Artist: (Nominated)\n\n2004, Best Male R&B Artist: (Nominated)\n\n2004, Best New Artist: (Nominated)\n\n2005, Best Gospel Artist: (Nominated)\n\n2003, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Sales Single - “Superstar/Flying Without Wings”\n\n2005, Top Gospel Artist\n\n2005, Top Gospel Album -I Need an Angel\n\n2004, Favorite Male R&B Vocal Performance - “Superstar”: (Nominated)\n\n2004, Outstanding Male Artist: (Nominated)\n\n2004, Outstanding New Artist: Won\n\n2004, Best New R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist: “Superstar”: (Nominated)\n\n2003, Choice Male Reality/Variety Star for American Idol: Won\n\nDiscographyAlbums\n\nAmerican Idol Season 2: All-Time Classic American Love Songs (2003)\n\nAmerican Idol: The Great Holiday Classics (2003)\n\nGenius & Friends (2005)\n\nAin’t Misbehavin’ (2009 Cast Recording)\n\n“What the World Needs Now” (with Season 2 Finalists)\n\n“God Bless the U.S.A.

He was one of the founding members of the Jazz Crusaders, the band which became simply the Crusaders in 1971, and remained a part of the group until its final album in 1991 (not including the 2003 reunion album Rural Renewal).\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, he enjoyed a successful solo career and guested on many recordings by other performers and groups, including Miles Davis, George Benson, Jimmy Witherspoon, B. B. King, Eric Clapton, Steely Dan, and the Supremes. Sample incorporated jazz, gospel, blues, Latin, and classical forms into his music.\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Sample died in Houston, Texas, of mesothelioma at age 75.\n\nBiography\n\nSample was born in Houston, Texas on February 1, 1939. Sample began to play the piano at age 5. He was a student of the organist and pianist Curtis Mayo.\n\nIn high school in the 1950s, Sample teamed up with friends saxophonist Wilton Felder and drummer “Stix” Hooper to form a group called the Swingsters. While studying piano at Texas Southern University, Sample met and added trombonist Wayne Henderson and several other players to the Swingsters, which became the Modern Jazz Sextet and then the Jazz Crusaders, in emulation of one of the leading progressive jazz bands of the day, Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. Sample never took a degree from the university; instead, in 1960, he and the Jazz Crusaders made the move from Houston to Los Angeles.\n\nThe group quickly found opportunities on the West Coast, making its first recording, Freedom Sounds in 1961 and releasing up to four albums a year over much of the 1960s. The Jazz Crusaders played at first in the dominant hard bop style of the day, standing out by virtue of their unusual front-line combination of saxophone (played by Wilton Felder) and Henderson’s trombone. Another distinctive quality was the funky, rhythmically appealing acoustic piano playing of Sample, who helped steer the group’s sound into a fusion between jazz and soul in the late 1960s. The Jazz Crusaders became a strong concert draw during those years.\n\nWhile Sample and his band mates continued to work together, he and the other band members pursued individual work as well. In 1969 Sample made his first recording under his own name; Fancy Dance featured the pianist as part of a jazz trio. In the 1970s, as the Jazz Crusaders became simply the Crusaders and branched out into popular sounds, Sample became known as a Los Angeles studio musician, appearing on recordings by the likes of Joni Mitchell, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, B. B. King, Joe Cocker, Minnie Riperton and Anita Baker. In 1975 he went into the studios with jazz legends Ray Brown on bass, and drummer Shelly Manne to produce a then state-of-the-art recording direct to disc entitled The Three. About this time Blue Note Records reissued some of the early work by the Jazz Crusaders as “The Young Rabbits”. This was a compilation of their recordings done between 1962 and 1968.\n\nThe electric keyboard was fairly new in the sixties, and Sample became one of the instrument’s pioneers. He began to use the electric piano while the group retained their original name, and the group hit a commercial high-water mark with the hit single “Street Life” and the album of the same name in 1979. In 1978 he recorded Swing Street Café with guitarist David T. Walker.\n\nThe Crusaders, after losing several key members, broke up after recording Life in the Modern World for the GRP label in 1987. Despite the disbanding of the Crusaders, the members would join each other to record periodically over the years, releasing Healing the Wounds in the early 1990s. Felder, Hooper, and Sample recorded their first album, called Rural Renewal, as the reunited Crusaders group in 2003 and played a concert in Japan in 2004.\n\nSince Sample's Fancy Dance (1969), he has recorded several solo albums, including the George Duke produced Sample This.\n\nGRP also released Joe Sample Collection, and a three-disc Crusaders Collection, as testament to Sample’s enduring legacy. Some of the pianist’s recent recordings are The Song Lives On (1999), featuring duets with singer Lalah Hathaway, and The Pecan Tree (2002), a tribute to his hometown of Houston, where he relocated in 1994. His 2004 album on Verve, Soul Shadows, paid tribute to Duke Ellington and Jelly Roll Morton, and pre-jazz bandleader James Reese Europe. In 2007 he recorded Feeling Good with vocalist Randy Crawford.\n\nIn 1983, MCA released Joe Sample's The Hunter LP. The Hunter sessions had taken place during the previous year at Hollywood Sound Recorders and Salty Dog Studios in Los Angeles, producing a fine body of recordings of which six were brought forward. Fans believe there maybe other recordings from the sessions yet to be released. Amongst the six tracks was the nine-minute Night Flight. UK Jazz Funk and Soul DJ Robbie Vincent premiered Night Flight in its entirety in the spring of 1983 on his Radio London “Saturday Show” prompting a surge of jazz fusion enthusiasts and Sample fans to buy up all the import copies from London stores. For Sample, The Hunter album featured a number of leading musicians of the day including Marcus Miller on bass and Paulinho Da Costa on percussion. Sample was also joined on the album by Phil Upchurch on lead guitar, Dean Parks (also on guitar), Steve Gadd and Bob Wilson on drums, John Phillips on bass clarinet, and Abraham Laboriel on bass. For production, Joe Sample called on his Crusaders’ stable mate Wilton Felder. The Hunter album came at a very important juncture in Sample’s solo push. Night Flight remains the great achievement from these sessions, although fans were extremely disappointed when an edited version appeared on the compilation Joe Sample Collection. The Hunter album has been transferred to CD from the original tapes but fans are still awaiting a remastered expanded edition with previously unreleased material and demos.\n\nSample appeared on stage at The Waterfront Hall, Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 28 May 2000, playing keyboard solo on George Benson's Deeper Than You Think. This concert was recorded and a DVD entitled George Benson: Absolutely Live was subsequently released. A studio version of Deeper Than You Think was recorded featuring Joe Sample in New York in May 1999 during sessions for a Benson collection which took the title Absolutely Benson. Fans again believe there may have been other collaborations of Sample - Benson which remain in the vaults unreleased.\n\nSome of his works were featured on The Weather Channel’s “Local on the 8s” segments and his song “Rainbow Seeker” is included in their 2008 compilation release, The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II. Nicole Kidman sang his song “One Day I’ll Fly Away” in the Baz Luhrmann film Moulin Rouge! The very popular “In All My Wildest Dreams”, also from the 1978 album Rainbow Seeker, was sampled on Tupac’s “Dear Mama”, De la Soul’s “WRMS’s Dedication to the Bitty”, Toni Braxton’s “What’s Good” and Arrested Development’s “Africa’s Inside Me”.\n\nSample had a bassist son named Nicklas Sample (with ex-wife Marianne), who is a member of the Coryell Auger Sample Trio featuring Julian Coryell and Karma Auger.\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Sample died in Houston, Texas from complications from mesothelioma lung disease. He was 75 years old. Sample had also suffered two heart attacks — the most recent in 2009. According to the Los Angeles Times he had also suffered illness caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which produces chronic fatigue. In 2013, Sample was hospitalized with pneumonia, according to Variety, the Hollywood and music industry trade paper.\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader\n\nWith The (Jazz) Crusaders\n\nFreedom Sound (Pacific Jazz, 1961)\n\nLookin’ Ahead (Pacific Jazz, 1962)\n\nThe Jazz Crusaders at the Lighthouse (Pacific Jazz, 1962)\n\nTough Talk (Pacific Jazz, 1963)\n\nHeat Wave (Pacific Jazz, 1963)\n\nJazz Waltz (Pacific Jazz, 1963) with Les McCann\n\nStretchin’ Out (Pacific Jazz, 1964)\n\nThe Thing (Pacific Jazz, 1965)\n\nChile Con Soul (Pacific Jazz, 1965)\n\nLive at the Lighthouse ‘66 (Pacific Jazz, 1966)\n\nTalk That Talk (Pacific Jazz, 1966)\n\nThe Festival Album (Pacific Jazz, 1966)\n\nUh Huh (Pacific Jazz, 1967)\n\nLighthouse ‘68 (Pacific Jazz, 1968)\n\nPowerhouse (Pacific Jazz, 1969)\n\nLighthouse '69 (Pacific Jazz, 1969)\n\nAs sideman\n\nWith Gene Ammons:\n\nFree Again (Prestige, 1971)\n\nWith Kenny Burrell\n\n'Round Midnight (Fantasy, 1972)\n\nWith Michael Franks\n\nThe Art of Tea (Reprise, 1975)\n\nWith Richard “Groove” Holmes\n\nWelcome Home (World Pacific, 1968)\n\nWith Milt Jackson\n\nMemphis Jackson (Impulse!, 1969)\n\nWith B.

His achievement of setting three world records and tying another in less than an hour at the 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has been called “the greatest 45 minutes ever in sport” and has never been equalled. At the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, Owens won international fame with four gold medals: 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4 × 100 meter relay. He was the most successful athlete at the games and, as a black man, was credited with “single-handedly crushing Hitler’s myth of Aryan supremacy”, although he “wasn’t invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either”.\n\nThe Jesse Owens Award is USA Track and Field’s highest accolade for the year’s best track and field athlete. Owens was ranked by ESPN as the sixth greatest North American athlete of the twentieth century and the highest-ranked in his sport.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nOwens was the youngest of ten children, three girls and seven boys, born to Henry Cleveland Owens (a sharecropper) and Mary Emma Fitzgerald in Oakville, Alabama, on September 12, 1913. J.C., as he was called, was nine years old when the family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, for better opportunities, as part of the Great Migration, when 1.5 million African Americans left the segregated South. When his new teacher asked his name (to enter in her roll book), he said “J.C.”, but because of his strong Southern accent, she thought he said “Jesse”. The name stuck, and he was known as Jesse Owens for the rest of his life.\n\nAs a boy, Owens took different jobs in his spare time: he delivered groceries, loaded freight cars and worked in a shoe repair shop while his father and older brother worked at a steel mill. During this period, Owens realized that he had a passion for running. Throughout his life, Owens attributed the success of his athletic career to the encouragement of Charles Riley, his junior high track coach at Fairmount Junior High School. Since Owens worked in a shoe repair shop after school, Riley allowed him to practice before school instead.\n\nOwens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915–2001) met at Fairmont Junior High School in Cleveland when he was 15 and she was 13. They dated steadily through high school. Ruth gave birth to their first daughter, Gloria, in 1932. They married on July 5, 1935 and had two more daughters together: Marlene, born in 1937, and Beverly, born in 1940. They remained married until his death in 1980.\n\nOwens first came to national attention when he was a student of East Technical High School in Cleveland; he equalled the world record of 9.4 seconds in the 100-yard (91 m) dash and long-jumped 24 feet 9 1⁄2 inches (7.56 metres) at the 1933 National High School Championship in Chicago.\n\nCareer\n\nOhio State University\n\nOwens attended The Ohio State University after employment was found for his father, ensuring the family could be supported. Affectionately known as the “Buckeye Bullet,” and under the coaching of Larry Snyder, Owens won a record eight individual NCAA championships, four each in 1935 and 1936. (The record of four gold medals at the NCAA was equaled only by Xavier Carter in 2006, although his many titles also included relay medals.) Though Owens enjoyed athletic success, he had to live off campus with other African-American athletes. When he traveled with the team, Owens was restricted to ordering carry-out or eating at “blacks-only” restaurants. Similarly, he had to stay at “blacks-only” hotels. Owens did not receive a scholarship for his efforts, so he continued to work part-time jobs to pay for school.\n\nOwens’s greatest achievement came in a span of 45 minutes on May 25, 1935, during the Big Ten meet at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he set three world records and tied a fourth. He equaled the world record for the 100 yard dash (9.4 seconds); and set world records in the long jump (26 ft 8 1⁄4 in or 8.13 m, a world record that would last 25 years); 220-yard (201.2 m) sprint (20.3 seconds); and 220-yard (201.2m) low hurdles (22.6 seconds, becoming the first to break 23 seconds). In 2005, University of Central Florida professor of sports history Richard C. Crepeau chose these wins on one day as the most impressive athletic achievement since 1850.\n\n1936 Berlin Summer Olympics\n\nOn December 4, 1935 NAACP Secretary Walter White wrote a letter—which he actually never sent—to Jesse Owens. In this letter, he was trying to dissuade Owens from taking part in the Olympics on the ground that an African-American could not help promote a racist regime after what his community had suffered at the hands of white racists in his own country. In the months prior to the Games, the movement in favour of a boycott gained momentum. Owens was convinced by the NAACP to declare “If there are minorities in Germany who are being discriminated against, the United States should withdraw from the 1936 Olympics.” Yet Owens and others eventually took part after Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Committee branded the advocates of a boycott as “un-American agitators.”\n\nSo in 1936, Owens and his United States teammates arrived in Berlin to compete at the Summer Olympics. According to fellow American sprinter James LuValle (who won bronze in the 400 meters), Owens arrived in Berlin to a throng of fans, many of them young girls, yelling “Wo ist Jesse? Wo ist Jesse?” Owens’s success at the games represented an unpleasant consternation for Adolf Hitler, who was using the games to show the world a resurgent Nazi Germany. He and other government officials had high hopes that German athletes would dominate the games with victories. Owens countered this by winning four gold medals.\n\nOn August 3, he won the 100 m sprint with a time of 10.3 s, defeating teammate and college friend Ralph Metcalfe by a tenth of a second and defeating Tinus Osendarp of the Netherlands by two tenths of a second. On August 4, he won the long jump with a leap of 8.06 m (26 ft 5 in), later crediting his achievement to the technical advice he received from Lutz Long, the German competitor whom he defeated. On August 5, he won the 200 m sprint with a time of 20.7 s, defeating Mack Robinson (the older brother of Jackie Robinson). On August 9, Owens won his fourth gold medal in the 4 × 100 m sprint relay when coach Dean Cromwell replaced Jewish-American sprinters Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller with Owens and Ralph Metcalfe, who teamed up with Frank Wykoff and Foy Draper to set a world record of 39.8 s in the event. This performance was not equaled until Carl Lewis won gold medals in the same events at the Soviet-boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1935 (the year before the Berlin Olympics), Owens set the world record in the long jump with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in), and this record would stand for 25 years (a very rare length of time for a track and field record), until it was finally broken by countryman Ralph Boston in 1960. Coincidentally, Owens was a spectator at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome when Boston took the gold medal in the long jump.\n\nJust before the competitions, Owens was visited in the Olympic village by Adi Dassler, the founder of the Adidas athletic shoe company. He persuaded Owens to wear Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik shoes, the first sponsorship for a male African American athlete.\n\nThe long-jump victory is documented, along with many other 1936 events, in the 1938 film Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl.\n\nOn the first day of competition, Hitler shook hands with only the German victors and then left the stadium. Olympic committee officials insisted Hitler greet every medalist or none at all. Hitler opted for the latter and skipped all further medal presentations. Historians have noted that Hitler may have left the games at this time due to looming rain clouds that might have postponed the games. This happened well before Owens was to compete, but has largely come to be believed to be the “snub”. On reports that Hitler had deliberately avoided acknowledging his victories, and had refused to shake his hand, Owens said at the time:\n\nHitler had a certain time to come to the stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened he had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters. But before he left I was on my way to a broadcast and passed near his box. He waved at me and I waved back. I think it was bad taste to criticize the ‘man of the hour’ in another country.\n\nAlbert Speer wrote that Hitler “was highly annoyed by the series of triumphs by the marvelous colored American runner, Jesse Owens. People whose antecedents came from the jungle were primitive, Hitler said with a shrug; their physiques were stronger than those of civilized whites and hence should be excluded from future games.”\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Siegfried Mischner, a German journalist, claimed that Owens carried around a photograph in his wallet of the Führer shaking his hand before the latter left the stadium. Owens, who felt the newspapers of the day reported ‘unfairly’ on Hitler’s attitude towards him, tried to get Mischner and his journalist colleagues to change the accepted version of history in the 1960s. Mischner claimed Owens showed him the photograph and told him: “That was one of my most beautiful moments.” Mischner added “(the picture) was taken behind the honour stand and so not captured by the world’s press. But I saw it, I saw him shaking Hitler’s hand!” According to Mischner, “the predominating opinion in post-war Germany was that Hitler had ignored Owens, so we therefore decided not to report on the photo. The consensus was that Hitler had to continue to be painted in a bad light in relation to Owens.” For some time, Mischner’s assertion was not confirmed independently of his own account, and Mischner himself admitted in Mail Online that “All my colleagues are dead, Owens is dead. I thought this was the last chance to set the record straight. I have no idea where the photo is or even if it exists still.”\n\nHowever, in 2014, Eric Brown, British fighter pilot and test pilot, the Fleet Air Arm’s most decorated living pilot, independently stated in a BBC documentary “I actually witnessed Hitler shaking hands with Jesse Owens and congratulating him on what he had achieved.” Additionally, an article in The Baltimore Sun in August 1936 reported that Hitler sent Owens a commemorative inscribed cabinet photograph of himself.\n\nIn Germany, Owens had been allowed to travel with and stay in the same hotels as whites, at a time when African Americans in many parts of the United States had to stay in segregated hotels.\n\nLater, on October 15, 1936 Owens repeated this allegation when he addressed an audience of African Americans at a Republican rally in Kansas City remarking that “Hitler didn’t snub me – it was our president who snubbed me. The president didn’t even send me a telegram.”\n\nDuring a Manhattan ticker-tape parade in his honor along Broadway’s Canyon of Heroes, someone handed Owens a paper bag. Owens paid it little mind until the parade concluded. When he opened it up, he found the bag contained $10,000 in cash. Owens’s wife Ruth later said, “And he [Owens] didn’t know who was good enough to do a thing like that. And with all the excitement around, he didn’t pick it up right away. He didn’t pick it up until he got ready to get out of the car.” After the parade, Owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator to reach the reception honoring him. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) never invited Jesse Owens to the White House following his triumphs at the Olympics games. While the Democrats had bid for the support of Owens, Owens rejected those overtures: as a staunch Republican, he endorsed Roosevelt’s Republican opponent, Alf Landon, in the 1936 presidential race.\n\nOwens, who joined the Republican Party after returning from Europe, was paid to campaign for African American votes for the Republican presidential nominee Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election. Speaking at a Republican rally held in Baltimore on October 9, 1936, Owens said “Some people say Hitler snubbed me. But I tell you, Hitler did not snub me. I am not knocking the President. Remember, I am not a politician, but remember that the President did not send me a message of congratulations because, people said, he was too busy.”\n\nLater life\n\nOwens was quoted saying the secret behind his success was “I let my feet spend as little time on the ground as possible. From the air, fast down, and from the ground, fast up.”\n\nAfter the games had finished, the Olympic team and Owens were all invited to compete in Sweden. He decided to capitalize on his success by returning to the United States to take up some of the more lucrative commercial offers. United States athletic officials were furious and withdrew his amateur status, ending his career immediately. Owens was angry, saying, “A fellow desires something for himself.” Owens argued that the racial discrimination he had faced throughout his athletic career, such as not being eligible for scholarships in college and therefore being unable to take classes between training and working to pay his way, meant he had to give up on amateur athletics in pursuit of financial gain elsewhere.\n\nProhibited from amateur sporting appearances to bolster his profile, Owens found out that the commercial offers had all but disappeared. In 1937, he briefly toured with a twelve-piece jazz band under contract with Consolidated Artists, but found it unfulfilling. He also made appearances at baseball games and other events. Finally, friend and former competitor from the University of Michigan, Willis Ward, brought Owens to Detroit to work at Ford Motor Company in 1942 as Assistant Personnel Director, later becoming Director, where he worked until 1946.\n\nIn 1946, Owens joined Abe Saperstein in the formation of the West Coast Baseball Association (WCBA), a new Negro baseball league; Owens was Vice-President and the owner of the Portland (Oregon) Rosebuds franchise. He toured with the Rosebuds, sometimes entertaining the audience in between doubleheader games by competing in races against horses. The WCBA disbanded after only two months.\n\nOwens helped promote the exploitation film Mom and Dad in African American neighborhoods. He tried to make a living as a sports promoter, essentially an entertainer. He would give local sprinters a ten- or twenty-yard start and beat them in the 100-yd (91-m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses; as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung thoroughbred that would be frightened by the starter’s shotgun and give him a bad jump. Owens said, “People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can’t eat four gold medals.” On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, “There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway.”\n\nOwens ran a dry cleaning business and worked as a gas station attendant to earn a living; he eventually filed for bankruptcy. In 1966, he was successfully prosecuted for tax evasion. At rock bottom, he was aided in beginning his rehabilitation. The government appointed him as a US goodwill ambassador. Owens traveled the world and spoke to companies such as the Ford Motor Company and stakeholders such as the United States Olympic Committee. After he retired, he owned racehorses.\n\nOwens initially refused to support the black power salute by African-American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He told them:\n\nThe black fist is a meaningless symbol. When you open it, you have nothing but fingers – weak, empty fingers. The only time the black fist has significance is when there’s money inside. There’s where the power lies.\n\nFour years later in his 1972 book I Have Changed, he moderated his opinion:\n\nI realized now that militancy in the best sense of the word was the only answer where the black man was concerned, that any black man who wasn’t a militant in 1970 was either blind or a coward.\n\nA few months before his death, Owens had tried unsuccessfully to convince President Jimmy Carter to withdraw his demand that the United States boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. He argued that the Olympic ideal was supposed to be observed as a time-out from war and that it was above politics.\n\nDeath\n\nOwens was a pack-a-day cigarette smoker for 35 years and had been hospitalized with an extremely aggressive and drug-resistant type of lung cancer on and off beginning in December 1979. He died of the disease at age 66 in Tucson, Arizona, on March 31, 1980, with his wife and other family members at his bedside. He is buried in Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe dormitory used by Owens during the Olympics has been fully restored into a living museum, with pictures of his accomplishments at the Games, and a letter (intercepted by the Gestapo) from a fan urging him not to shake hands with Hitler.\n\nAwards and honors\n\n1936 AP Athlete of the Year (male)\n\nIn 1936, four English Oak saplings, one for each Olympic gold medal, from the German Olympic Committee, were planted. One of the trees was planted at the University of Southern California, one at Rhodes High School in Cleveland, where he trained, and one is rumored to be located on the Ohio State University campus, but has yet to be identified. The fourth tree was located at the home of Jesse Owens’ mother, but was removed when the house was demolished.\n\nIn 1970, Owens was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1976 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford.\n\nIn 1976, he was made part of the Olympic Order for his fight against racism in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n\nIn 1980, a new asteroid was discovered by Antonín Mrkos at Kleť Observatory which was named as 6758 Jesseowens in honor of Jesse Owens.\n\nUSA Track and Field created the Jesse Owens Award in 1981, which is given annually to the country’s top track and field athlete.\n\nIn 1983, Owens was part of the inaugural class into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1984, an Emmy Award-winning biographical television film of his life, The Jesse Owens Story, was released, with Dorian Harewood portraying Owens.\n\nIn 1984 a street near the Olympic Stadium in Berlin was renamed Jesse-Owens-Allee, and the Jesse Owens Realschule/Oberschule (a secondary school) in Berlin-Lichtenberg, was named for him.\n\nOn March 28, 1990, Owens was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President George H. W. Bush.\n\nTwo U.S. postage stamps have been issued to honor Owens, one in 1990 and another in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, Owens’s hometown of Oakville, Alabama, dedicated Jesse Owens Memorial Park and Museum in his honor, at the same time that the Olympic Torch came through the community, 60 years after his Olympic triumph. An article in the Wall Street Journal of June 7, 1996, covered the event and included this inscription written by poet Charles Ghigna that appears on a bronze plaque at the Park:\n\nIn 2001, The Ohio State University dedicated Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium for track and field events. A sculpture honoring Owens occupies a place of honor in the esplanade leading to the rotunda entrance to Ohio Stadium. Owens competed for the Buckeyes on the track surrounding the football field that existed prior to the 2001 expansion of Ohio Stadium. The campus also houses three recreational centers for students and staff named in his honor.\n\nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Jesse Owens on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.\n\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, a statue of Owens in his Ohio State track suit was installed at Fort Huntington Park, west of the old Courthouse.\n\nPhoenix, Arizona named the Jesse Owens Medical Plaza in his honor, as well as Jesse Owens Parkway.\n\nIn Markus Zusak’s 2006 bestselling novel, The Book Thief, a character named Rudy Steiner idolizes Owens.\n\nJesse Owens Park, located in Tucson, Arizona, is a staple of local youth athletics there.\n\nAt the 2009 World Athletic Championships in Berlin, all members of the United States Track & Field team wore badges with “JO” to commemorate Owens’s victories in the same stadium 73 years before.\n\nIn early 2010, the Ohio Historical Society proposed Jesse Owens as a finalist from a statewide vote for inclusion in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol.\n\nOn November 15, 2010, the city of Cleveland renamed East Roadway, between Rockwell and Superior avenues in Public Square, Jesse Owens Way.\n\nA novel in French written by Lebanese novelist Alexandre Najjar, Berlin 36, Plon (publisher), Paris, 2009, tells the story of Owens, particularly during the Berlin Olympic games.

Shooting began in Montreal on July 24, 2014.\n\nWikipedia\n\nJennifer Kate Hudson (born September 12, 1981) is an American singer, actress and spokesperson. She rose to fame in 2004 as a finalist on the third season of American Idol,coming in seventh place.\n\nAs an actress, she made her film debut portraying Effie White in Dreamgirls, for which she gained worldwide acclaim and won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has also appeared in such films as Sex and the City, The Secret Life of Bees and Black Nativity. She has made numerous television appearances, including guest roles on Smash, Empire and Inside Amy Schumer. In 2015 she made her Broadway debut in the role of Shug Avery in the 2015 revival of The Color Purple.\n\nAs a singer, Hudson has released three studio albums. Her debut album Jennifer Hudson, released in 2008, debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA, with sales exceeding a million copies worldwide. The record was nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning the 2009 Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. Her second album I Remember Me, released in 2011, also debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. Her third and most recent album JHUD peaked in the top ten and featured the Grammy-nominated track “It’s Your World”.\n\nIn October 2008, after Hudson’s mother, brother and nephew were killed in a shooting, Hudson stepped out of the public eye for three months. Hudson resumed her public appearances in 2009, with high-profile performances at Super Bowl XLIII, the Grammy Awards,American Idol’, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Hudson has been described as a friend of President Barack Obama, who invited her to appear with him at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills in May 2009. She also performed at the White House at the “Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement” event. In 2013, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEarly life\n\nHudson was born on September 12, 1981, in Chicago, Illinois. She is the third and youngest child of Darnell Donnerson (November 7, 1950 – October 24, 2008) and Samuel Simpson (died 1999). She was raised as a Baptist in Englewood and attended Dunbar Vocational High School, from which she graduated in 1999. She cites Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, and Patti LaBelle as her overall biggest influences and inspiration. At the age of 7, she got her start in performing by singing with the church choir and doing community theater with the help of her late maternal grandmother, Julia. She enrolled at Langston University but she left after a semester due to homesickness and unhappiness with the weather, and registered at Kennedy–King College.\n\nIn January 2002, Hudson signed her first recording contract with Righteous Records, a Chicago-based independent record label. She was released from her five-year contract with Righteous Records so that she could appear on American Idol in 2004.\n\nCareer\n\n2004–05: American Idol\n\nHudson auditioned for the third season of American Idol in Atlanta commenting that she had been singing on Disney Cruise Lines (aboard the Disney Wonder) for the past few months (as one of the Muses from Hercules); and contestant judge Randy Jackson said, “We’re expecting more than a cruise ship performance from you.” Hudson received the highest number of votes in the “Top 9” after her performance of Elton John’s “Circle of Life” on April 6, 2004, but two weeks later was eliminated during the “Top 7” show after performing Barry Manilow’s, “Weekend in New England.” The bottom three consisting of three African-American females led to controversy. In May 2009, MTV listed Hudson as the sixth greatest American Idol and noted her exit was the most shocking of all time. In May 2010, the Los Angeles Times claimed Hudson to be the third greatest Idol contestant in the history of the show, placing behind season one winner Kelly Clarkson and season four winner Carrie Underwood.\n\nPerformances\n\n2006–07: Dreamgirls and breakthrough\n\nIn one of her first appearances on a record, Hudson is featured in a duet, “The Future Ain’t What It Used to Be”, on Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. In September 2006, Hudson performed the song, “Over It,” live on Fox Chicago Morning News. In the interview she stated the song would be included on her debut album, to be released in early 2007; however, this was before she was signed to a record label. In November 2006, Hudson signed a record deal with Arista Records. On The Oprah Winfrey Show, Hudson announced plans to enter the studio in March 2007. Hudson said on The Tyra Banks Show, on February 23, 2007, that she just finished the first song for the album. Hudson also recorded a song she co-wrote with Bill Grainer and Earl Powell called “Stand Up”, which was available for preview on her fan website. The track was produced by Chicago natives Powell and Herman Little III, who also arranged the song. The power-ballad would later become available on the deluxe edition of Hudson’s self-titled album as a bonus track.\n\nIn November 2005, Hudson was cast in the role of Effie White for the film adaptation of the musical Dreamgirls, which also starred Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles and Eddie Murphy. The role, originally created in a Broadway performance by Jennifer Holliday, marked Hudson’s debut screen performance. She won the role over hundreds of professional singers and actresses, including Fantasia Barrino. Filming of Dreamgirls began on January 9, 2006, and the film went into limited release on December 25, 2006, and national release on January 12, 2007. Hudson has won particular praise for her show-stopping onscreen rendition of the hit song, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going”, the signature song of the role, which had earlier been recorded, and had already reached the status of musical standard, because of the definitive performance of Jennifer Holliday. The New York Observer described Hudson’s performance of the song as “five mellifluous, molto vibrato minutes that have suddenly catapulted Ms. Hudson… into the position of front-runner for the best supporting actress Oscar”. Newsweek said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she, “is going to raise goose bumps across the land.“ Variety magazine wrote that Hudson’s performance \"calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in The Rose, with a voice like the young Aretha”. Hudson’s version of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” debuted at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the January 13, 2007, issue. The Dreamgirls track became Hudson’s first top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot Adult R&B Airplay chart on February 24, 2007. “Love You I Do” was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song and won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.\n\nAs Effie White, Hudson has garnered 29 awards from film critics as Best Supporting Actress and Breakthrough Performer of 2006. She won the Golden Globe Award as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In addition, she has been named Best Supporting Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association and also by the Screen Actors Guild. After seeing Hudson’s performance in Dreamgirls, Simon Cowell taped a congratulatory message to her, which aired on The Oprah Winfrey Show. With the March 2007 issue, Jennifer Hudson became the third African-American celebrity and the first African-American singer to grace the cover of Vogue magazine. On February 11, 2007, the 60th British Academy Film Awards were held in London, but Hudson was not there to accept her award for BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. The BAFTA Award went missing and Hudson did not receive her award until April 22, 2011, when it was presented to her on the Graham Norton Show. On February 25, 2007, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film. During her acceptance speech, Hudson said: “Oh, my God, I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. I didn’t think I was going to win. […] If my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration.” She also concluded her speech by thanking Jennifer Holliday. Later in 2007, the mayor of her home town, Chicago, Richard M. Daley, declared March 6 as “Jennifer Hudson Day”. She was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on June 18, along with 115 other individuals for 2007. Entertainment Weekly put her performance on its end-of-the-decade, “best-of” list, saying, “Sure, Beyoncé’s performance was great. And Eddie Murphy’s was impressive. But there was really only one reason we all rushed to see 2006’s Dreamgirls: Jennifer Hudson’s soul-to-the-rafters rendition of the classic ‘And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going’. When she sang ‘You’re gonna love me,’ it wasn’t just a lyric — it was a fact.”\n\n2008–09: Winnie Mandela and Jennifer Hudson\n\nIn May 2008, Hudson appeared in the feature film Sex and the City as Louise, Carrie Bradshaw’s assistant. Filming finished in December 2007 and the movie was released on May 30, 2008. In October 2008, Hudson made her third film appearance in The Secret Life of Bees as Rosaleen, the mother figure of Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning). Also starring in the film are fellow Oscar nominees Queen Latifah and Sophie Okonedo, as well as Alicia Keys. The film opened on October 17, 2008, and grossed over $37 million at the box office. The film won two People’s Choice Awards in January 2009 in the categories, Favorite Drama Movie and Favorite Independent Movie. The film also received nine Black Reel Awards nominations including three wins. Hudson was nominated for her performance in the film, but lost to Queen Latifah. The film also received eight nominations at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards, including a nomination for Hudson for her performance. In 2009, Hudson starred as Kathy Archenault in Fragments, a film based on the novel by Roy Freirich, with Dakota Fanning and Forest Whitaker. The name of the film was changed from “Winged Creatures” to “Fragments”. It was released on DVD on August 4, 2009. In 2010, Hudson started filming the biopic film Winnie Mandela based on the South African politician Winnie Mandela starring alongside Terrence Howard and directed by Darrell J. Roodt. Andre Pieterse and Roodt and Paul L. Johnson based the film’s script on Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob’s biography, Winnie Mandela: A Life. The Creative Workers Union of South Africa have opposed this choice, stating they will push for a moratorium on the film if the casting is not reversed. Winnie Mandela has threatened legal action over this film, claiming she was not “consulted” about the film. Winnie Mandelawas originally scheduled to be released in December 2011; the trailer was released in 2010. Image Entertainment released the film on September 6, 2013.\n\nIn January 2008, Hudson returned to the studio to record new songs for her debut studio album. Her label was reportedly unhappy with the direction they were sending Hudson musically and decided it would be best to scrap the older songs and instead focus on new ones. Hudson worked with Ryan Tedder and Timbaland on a number of songs. Her debut single, “Spotlight” was released on June 10, 2008 and became Hudson’s first top 40 hit peaking at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom and Turkey. Her debut studio album, Jennifer Hudson was released on September 30, 2008 on Arista and was written by Ne-Yo, who co-produced along with Stargate. Additional contributors on the album include Timbaland, Missy Elliott, Robin Thicke, Harvey Mason, Jr., Diane Warren, Earl Powell, and Christopher “Tricky” Stewart, among others. The album debuted at number two on theBillboard 200 with 217,000 copies in the US and opened to positive reviews. As of August 2009, the album has sold 739,000 copies in the US, receiving a Gold certification for surpassing sales of 500,000. She has performed the song, “All Dressed in Love” for the Sex and the City soundtrack, which was released on May 27, 2008. Hudson performed the national anthem at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The album’s second single was to be released in October 2008, and was originally set to be “My Heart” before “If This Isn’t Love” was chosen as the official second single. After three of her family members were brutally murdered, the single was rescheduled for a January 2009 release. However, in January 2009, her label decided to postpone the release of the second single once more until, choosing a February 2009 release date. After the release of “If This Isn’t Love”, the single eventually peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. The third single was announced as “Pocketbook” featuring Ludacris in April 2009, for a June 2009 release, despite speculation that the third single would be “My Heart” after it was canceled as the second single. In May 2009, “Pocketbook” was canceled as the third single due to negative reception from fans and critics alike. The third single was then rescheduled as “Giving Myself” and was released on June 2, 2009 to the US. Her debut album garnered Hudson three nominations at the 2009 Grammy Awards; Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for “Spotlight”, Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for “I’m His Only Woman” with Fantasia Barrino, and Best R&B Album for Jennifer Hudson. She won the last of these and performed at the awards ceremony.\n\n2009–11: I Remember Me and other endeavours\n\nIn February 2009, Hudson made her first public appearance since the murders when she sang the Star-Spangled Banner at Super Bowl XLIII. She toured the United States with Robin Thicke in 2009. In early May 2009, Hudson suffered “throat fatigue” and had to reschedule her May 16–19, 2009, tour dates. She sang “Will You Be There” at the Michael Jackson memorial service in July 2009. Hudson recorded “Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye),” originally by Gladys Knight & the Pips, for American Idol Season 3: Greatest Soul Classics — the official American Idol album for the third season. She also performed the song “Easy to be Hard” on the Actors’ Fund benefit recording of the musical Hair; and she is featured on Ne-Yo’s second album, Because of You, on the track, “Leaving Tonight”.
