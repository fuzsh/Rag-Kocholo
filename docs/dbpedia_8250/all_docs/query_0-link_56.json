        "meta_description": "The catalogue shows diverse art currents of the 19th century, well represented with beautiful genre paintings from Belgium, Scotland and France. A monumental work by Georges Fichefet, shown at the Brussels Salon in 1887 is the largest work ( 6 sq. meters!) we had for quite some time.\r\nIn 2024 we commemorate impressionist Emile Claus, who passed away 100 years ago.  We will show a rare early palette of the master, unknown to scholars and never shown to the public.  Furthermore we are proud to present one of only two known oil studies By Claus for his masterpiece: ‘Koeien doorwaden de Leie’ (Cows crossing the river Leie).  The painting remained in the collection of a family member of Claus until now and hasn’t been shown to the public since 1976.\r\nWe show other works by Claus in different media, as well as works from fellow luminists Georges Buysse, Jenny Montigny, Anna De Weert, etc. \r\nWe have assembled a fine collection of works by Frits Van Loo, friend of Claus, former director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent and one of the leading persons in the cultural scene of the early 20th century.  The works were bought from the estate of Van Loo and lay dormant in a private collection ever since. \r\nAs ever, we support the rich Ghent art scene and show original work by Cécile Cauterman, Jules De Bruycker, Clement De Porre, Madeleine Van Thorenburgh, Piet Heckers, Maurice Dupuis.  We have rediscovered a masterpiece by Jo N. De Vuyst: his unique ‘Carnaval’ cabinet, signed and dated 1925, published in contemporary literature but unseen since almost 100 years.\r\nWe close our ‘Classic Section’ with an unusual modern work by Antoon Catrie, a bronze by Geo Vindevogel and a hand printed book by Julius De Praetere, ‘Het Vaderhuis’, written by Karel Van De Woestijne. \r\nDo also check our other catalogues: Art from the 1960’s &amp; ‘70’s (III) and Heavy Metal: silver and metal objects from the 1880’s to the Noughties (II).",
