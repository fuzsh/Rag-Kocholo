        "text": "Gustave Marie Clémént Francotte was a Belgian politician and minister for the Catholic Party. He was people's representative in the district of Liège (1900-1912) and minister of industry and labour (1902-1907). He was one of the co-founders of the Christian Mutualities. He championed the organisation of a World's Fair in his hometown, hence a medal was dedicated to him. On 7 January 1906, Francotte was honoured at a banquet attended by more than six hundred people. The issue of this medal was by subscription among the exhibitors of the Liège World Fair."
