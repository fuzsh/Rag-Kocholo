        "text": "This special issue on the ‘politics of consumption’ in the modern age revisits the political approaches adopted within consumption history in the last twenty years. New directions to explore in the future study of the politics of consumption are identified, here defined as the discursive process through which consumers and consumption become framed and politicized by state- and/or market-driven actors for wider societal frameworks and goals. In what follows, the complex interrelations between politics and consumption will be interrogated from a variety of perspectives by combining insights from a diverse range of cases throughout the North Atlantic World from the early nineteenth-century until the 1980s. The five contributions all apply fundamental theories, concepts and methodologies from political history, investigating topics such as the municipal regulation of meat consumption, parliamentary debates about consumer citizenship, food propaganda among expat communities, anti-imperial sartorial practices and discourses of consumer austerity in times of economic crisis. The articles reunited here underline the centrality of power dynamics in shaping consumers and consumption, observable on all levels and affecting all actors, hence emphasizing the necessity to reckon with these often hidden but very real forces in historical research on consumption.\n\nJust as the social categories of class, gender, and religion became unstable during the “age of fracture” (Daniel Rodgers), the idea that we are all consumers was consolidated. The emergence of societies in which the consumer became a pivotal figure during the second half of the twentieth century constitutes a distinct phase in the history of consumption, which impacted the politics of consumption. This article expands the view of political consumption by looking at the institutionalization of the consumer in Dutch political system. In the course of the postwar period, an abstract notion of the consumer became widely accepted. This view was emancipatory, negating existing differences through unifying consumer policies. Focusing on the entanglement of the consumer with other social roles and categories in these negotiations, the article demonstrates that political consumption is not an anomaly, but the result of such entanglements.\n\nAnti-capitalism and anti-consumerism seem to be part of the same package and, for some, anti-consumerism has become the core element of anti-capitalist activism. In this paper I will argue that such an approach inadvertently allies itself with reactionary anticapitalisms as it fails to understand the contribution of consumer culture to the proliferation of values of freedom and personal development that underpin the Marxian notion of communism. Therefore, I will suggest, there is a case for a socialist defence of consumer culture. I will further argue that the capitalist relations of production and the growing inequalities resulting from them limit the liberty which consumerism inspires, while capitalist employers seek to expropriate the creative and inter-connected individuality fostered in the sphere of consumption. Hence, I will suggest, there is a case for a consumerist critique of capitalism. Finally I will propose that consumerism also contributes to a development of the gener..."
