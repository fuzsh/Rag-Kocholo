        "text": "This is a story about a ‘hovenier’ from Bergen op Zoom. Someone from one of the classic Bergen op Zoom families that made the city in what it is today. One of the characteristics of this group is that they never moved very far away. Maybe only to surrounding villages with their little vegetable carts. But at the end of the 19th century, the ‘hoveniers’ weren’t small scale farmers anymore. Many of them owned large villas in the old city centre and they assured a lot of farming ground for themselves by marrying within their own group. There wasn’t a lot of reason to emigrate elsewhere. Except for one of them: he was of a different opinion.\n\nIn this article I will write about everything American that I’ve found in the timeline of the life of my grandma’s great-uncle. I’ve tried, with the help of names and facts, to give a general view of the US in those days, and how immigrants influenced the US and the people they left behind. From birth certificates to native American tribes, from procedures to post cards. I hope I’ve succeeded in this mission.\n\nPlease note that I’ve used the metric system as is common outside of the United States. A converstion tool can be found here. Dates written with a ‘slash’ are in Dutch order, so DD/MM-YYYY. Sources are not translated. – With special thanks to mister Dami Koevoets of local museum ‘de Holle Roffel’, misses Anne Paterson of the Appleton library, my former high school English teacher Noud Jehoel and my distant family members Barbara Withagen Ciske, Beth Meldrum Withagen and Gerald McCarthy.\n\nWalterus or Waltherus (Walter, Wouter) Withagen was born on the 13th of November 1886, at 10pm in the Dubbelstraat ,Bergen op Zoom, neighbourhood D number 165. The birth declaration was done by his father Godefridus Withagen, forty years old, hovenier and Jacobus Johannes Trimbos, 33, without profession. His mother was Maria Withagen, housewife. They all lived in Bergen op Zoom. Walter grew up in the family home at the Dubbelstraat, in the Kaai neighbourhood. I wrote about that house last month in this article.\n\nFirst a bit of text for my distant American family. How am I related to this story? Wouter or Walter Withagen, I use both names alternately, was a younger brother of my great-great-grandmother Paulina Maria Franken-Withagen (1873-1942, number 21). In Dutch it is usual to note the maiden name second, the order is different. Her son was my great-grandfather Martien Franken (1908-1950), whose daughter was my grandma on my father’s side: Corrie Bernaards-Franken (1937-2017). So Walter Withagen was my grandma’s great-uncle. I asked her about her family in the US, and she remembered it vaguely. Now something unusual for me: I’m going to try to tell you about the basics of my own city. Bergen op Zoom is a mid-size city, 66.000 inhabitants, in the western part of the Dutch province of North-Brabant. It is situated between the North Sea coast in the west and beautiful forests in the east. North-Brabant is the , predominantly catholic, southern part of the Netherlands, and culturally closer to Belgium than to Holland. Bergen is an ancient city, with lots of monuments and lots of ancient culture and traditions. I’ve tried to find some links that can tell the ‘outsider’ somewhat more about my town in English, and found some. For example: this link, this link, this link, this link or this link. But the most important thing is: you can always contact me for questions about my city or about your Bergen op Zoom ancestors, or translations of parts of my website.\n\nIn 1906, when Walter was twenty, he was required to register for the draft. As a profession, ‘hovenier’ was noted. His lottery number was 7. The next year, Walter was again mentioned in the archives. His father Godefridus is then lying on his deathbed in the family home at the Dubbelstraat. Notary Van Gruting comes by and takes inventory of Godefridus’ possessions. The total possessions of the family were two cows, grain and hay, a horse, a cart, a rig, farming equipment, a tub, baskets, manure worth ten guilders, twelve chickens, a nightstand with table, chairs, a lamp, a mirror, a blanket, a pillow, some potteries, a closet with household equipment, a couch, a milking table with milking equipment, a cot with belongings, two heaters, an ice cart, a bicycle, men’s and women’s clothing, a safe, vegetables and fruit on the owned farm land and three houses: two on the Artilleriestraat and one at the Dubbelstraat. Apart from the houses, the total of goods was worth 1353 guilders. The same document mentioned Wouter as one of the underage children of the family, with the note that one became of age at 21 years at that time.\n\nAs we take a look back at the draft, we find further details in the draft lottery register. Number seven wasn’t Walter’s lucky number: the military commission advised ‘hire’ and Walter was drawn on the 22nd of december 1905. On the 2nd of march 1906 he was enlisted in the army in Bergen op Zoom’s famous 3rd infantry regiment. The report that was written down in the last column of the register notes some particularities. For example, he went on leave for an unknown time on the 27th of july 1907. A few weeks after his father passed away, so maybe it had something to do with that event. Also on the 18th of september 1909, the 24th of september 1912 and the 19th of september 1913 he went on big leave. The next note stated that Walter was written out of the military because of ‘discharge as a deserter’. He ran away. However, on the 30th of december 1916 he was enlisted again, with the note that he was written out because of desertion on the 22th of september 1915. The word ‘since’ was used in this sentence, so maybe a trial or punishment had taken place in the meantime. It seems Wouter was lost for them for a while on the 22th of february 1915, and he was arrested on the 22th of september that year and had to enroll again in the military. On the 18th of march 1918 he was enlisted for the ‘national defence’ department in Bergen op Zoom.\n\nSo Walter deserted in the course of 1914. Although the exact reason wasn’t stated, it’s good to give a bit of context about the situation at that moment. World War I broke out. Tens of thousands of Belgian refugees flocked to Bergen op Zoom. Almost all young men in the region were mobilized and had to serve at the nearby Belgian border, see for example this photograph of my great-grandfather Toon van Dijke and his brothers in Ossendrecht. The refugees lived in enormous camps on what is now Kijk in de Pot park and Plein 13 square, and brought terrifying stories with them. Although everyone tried to make the best of it and a lot of work was being done, the atmosphere in the town must have been very tense, as it was in the rest of Europe.\n\nThe second question we can ask about this story is: where did Walter go? One could state that the civil registration and the army administrators didn’t communicate very well. When we take a look at the Bergen op Zoom civil registration over the 1900-1920 period, we see that my great-great-grandmother Paulina Maria had already married and left the family home in 1900, and Walter’s other sisters also left in this time period. As addresses, Dubbelstraat D189 (renumbered to 50), Glymesstraat M265 and Dubbelstraat 10 were given. In Dutch, it is custom to write the house number after the street name in an address. At Walter’s registration it was stated that he left for Reinholtz in North-America on the 28th of may 1914, and in the city registration of outgoing citizens this date was also noted. As occupation they noted ‘farmer’. The 28th of May was before WWI broke out.\n\nThe Flemish TV-station Canvas broadcast the documentary series ‘Publiek Geheim’ or ‘public secret’ in 2015. One episode was about Belgian emigrants on the famous Titanic. This episode gives a very good example of how young men in the Benelux were motivated to emigrate in the 1910’s, and how this emigration took place, practically. The situation in Flanders was similar to that in North-Brabant. I subtitled this episode myself.\n\nAll immigrants that wanted to enter the US had to pass one place: Ellis Island. Ellis Island is an island in the Hudson river in New York City, between the island on which the Statue of Liberty is situated and Lower Manhattan. The US wasn’t as strict on immigration in 1915, in fact, they were unbelievably open to immigration compared to, for example, the Dutch or Belgian immigration policies right now. The image of the land where one can achieve anything was very much alive and that attracted huge amounts of immigrants since the middle of the 19th century, mostly from Europe, Russia and China. Although the Wild West times were coming to an end and America entered modern times with the beginning of the 20th century, there was still a lot of wild and open space in the Midwest, ready to be developed, and an ever growing economy with an ever growing amount of jobs. For this reason, the motto on the Statue of Liberty is:\n\n“give me your tired, your poor (..) your huddled masses yearning to breathe free”\n\nEllis Island, on the state border of New York and New Jersey, was built to have more control over all those tired and poor people. When one arrived on the island, they underwent a medical exam and were registered in detail. About 2% of the people arriving were refused, which isn’t a lot, for example because they were very ill or had a criminal past. That means for as much as the American authorities knew, that there wasn’t an Interpol database they could check or anything. After all: Wouter wasn’t a ‘criminal’ because of his desertion?\n\nSpeaking about Walter, I found him in the Ellis Island registers. The ship he sailed with, the Noordam, departed from Rotterdam and arrived on May 30, 1914 on Ellis Island. What was taken down about him was his age, 26 years old, his profession, farmer, that he wasn’t married, was able to read and write, was of Dutch ethnicity and Dutch nationality and had last been living in Bergen op Zoom. He had to state a name of someone who he had left behind, which was his mother Maria Withagen-Withagen, mentioned as the ‘Wid. Withagen, Bergen op Zoom N.B.’, Wid. meaning widow. Then there was the column in which one had to state the final destination of their journey, which in this case was ‘Reynolds’ in ‘ND’, the state code for North Dakota. The town name the civil registration in his home town germanized to Reinholtz was actually Reynolds!\n\nBut this wasn’t everything the immigration services had to know. Noted was that Walter had a ticket for his journey to North Dakota, with an ‘S’ written next to it (I don’t know what the S means yet). Also he was carrying fifty dollars, paid for the journey himself, had not been to the US before, was of good physical and mental health, wasn’t a polygamist or anarchist (and imagine a custom agent who had to ask this for example to a very poor Zeelandish family that had never read a newspaper before), was 5,5 inches long, had black hair and black eyes and a scar on the frontside of his body. But the most important question was if he was going to work or live with acquaintances. And that was the case: he went to his sister M. Withagen who was living with J. Akkerman in Reynolds, ND. I think I missed something!\n\nTo find out how Walter’s sister ended up in North Dakota, we have to go back to the Bergen op Zoom archives. Maria Withagen was born on June 12th 1880 at 8am in the Withagen family home at the Dubbelstraat, neighbourhood D number 165. The birth declaration was done by her father Godefridus Withagen, at that moment 35 years old and hovenier, with witnesses Johannes Baptist Trimbos, 55, owner of a coffee shop and Johannes Hopmans, 32, hovenier, all living in Bergen op Zoom. Maria married on August 24th 1905 in Bergen op Zoom with Johannes Walterus Langenberg from Bergen op Zoom, at that moment 25 years old and laborer. So Langenberg was Walter’s brother-in-law. He was born on July 8th 1880 on Kettingstraat G41 in Bergen op Zoom, as a son of hovenier Johannes Langenberg and Johanna Hopmans. The couple Langenberg-Withagen moved to Dubbelstraat D142/renumbered to 15 on August 21st 1905, a few days before their marriage. On February 23rd 1914 they left for North Amerika.\n\nThe couple left from Rotterdam with the ship the ‘Potsdam’ and arrived on Ellis Island on March 7th 1914. And they didn’t go alone. It was a group of four people from Bergen op Zoom, all going to Reynolds in North Dakota. The group consisted of Jan Langenberg, 34, Maria Langenberg-Withagen, 34, Willem Klaassen, 42, and Roeland Johannes van Nispen, eighteen years old, all farmers. All of them had to state someone they left behind: Jan’s father Jan Langenberg in Bergen op Zoom, Willem’s father Jacob Klaassen in the Bergen op Zoom countryside and Roeland’s stepfather F. Elsakkers in Bergen op Zoom. With the last mention they meant Philippus van Elzakker, a widower who remarried Roeland’s mother Antonetta Laurina Jalink. Both of them had eight children at the time of their marriage, which means it became one family with sixteen kids. Willem Klaassen was born on May 18th 1872 in the Potterstaat in Bergen op Zoom, the street I live in. He was a son of farmer Jacobus Klaassen and Catharina de Dooij from Ossendrecht. Willem wasn’t married when he went to the US with Roeland, Jan and Maria. In the arrival register it was noted that all four of them paid for their own journey and all four of them were going to Reynolds to go live with a friend, a certain Van Mansfeld, a surname well known in the hovenier community in Bergen op Zoom. This guy was probably Laurens van Mansfeld, a Bergen op Zoom farmer that went to the US when he was 27 years old. Laurens arrived on Ellis Island on March 12th 1910 with the ship the Lapland from Antwerp. He was part of a large group of people that consisted of two families from Velsen and some young men from Druten and Haarlem. They all went to a certain Van den Heuvel in the very small village of Butler, Minnesota. It seems the whole America-story started with this Van den Heuvel.\n\nNorth Dakota is quite a stereotypical mid western state. Located in the Great Plains, with the Rocky Mountains in the west, Canada in the north and the Great Lakes region in the east. Nowadays it has about 700.000 inhabitants and a mostly farming based economy. The area was part of French Louisiana until 1803, but at that time nearly uninhabited. From the 1870’s and onwards the US federal government started selling land to immigrants, while railroads were being constructed and towns founded. As was the case in the larger part of the central US it were mainly German immigrants that were attracted to this, next to Americans from east coast states. However, in North Dakota and bordering Minnesota, a large Norwegian community arose, something which can be seen in the general map at the top of this article.\n\nIn the decade the Bergen op Zoom people went to Dakota, the situation was quite different. North and South Dakota weren’t a territory anymore, but fully-grown US states. Most of the land had been cultured in a planned matter, something which can be seen today by the giant ‘chess board pattern’ in the landscape. This didn’t mean that there weren’t new villages and communities being founded. Reynolds was founded in 1883 on the border of two counties. The east border of the state, is formed by the Red River of the North, or in french La Rivière Rouge du Nord. This river flows in the direction of Lake Winnipeg in Canada, although the region is sitting between the Mississippi and a tributary of the Mississippi. The two counties in which Reynolds is located are Grand Forks and Traill.\n\nPage 12 of the evening news paper ‘Grand Forks Herald’ from July 3rd, 1916 was kind of a large advertisement for the village. The page begins with the text: [this quote was translated into dutch first and re-translated into english]\n\n“One of the most progressive cities in the entire north west is Reynolds, a lively business town, located on the border of the counties Grand Forks and Traill. Reynolds is known throughout the whole north west by her progressiveness and her unprecedented location amidst the richest part of the best farming area in the world. With her connection to a grand transcontinental railroad she has the great chance of becoming a city of notable size. Reynolds already established a reputation as one of the most progressive cities in the north west and the beauty en modernizing of the city have been meaning a lot to people looking for a clean and beautiful place to found there home.”\n\nThis text is nice as an advert, but it isn’t good journalism, to say the least. The village had reached it highest population point twenty years before, in 1896: six hundred inhabitants. Nowadays the streets still aren’t paved and the population halved since the end of the 19th century. Looking for the Bergen op Zoom group in a book in honor of the centennial of Reynolds, I found quite a lot of traces that point to the Norwegian background of the population, a thing this region, as I wrote earlier, is known for. No mention of Akkerman, Van den Heuvel, Van Mansfeld, Withagen, Van Nispen or Klaassen was found. Their existence in the US must have been built up quite hastily.. or maybe not.\n\nWillem Klaassen returned on December 29th, 1915. He was registered as living back in Bergen op Zoom on Moerstraatsebaan 99, the same address he lived before leaving, ‘ambtshalve’. The latter means that Willem didn’t go to the city hall to report his return, although I suspect that he met an official in the meantime, because it was noted he came back from Reynolds, not written as ‘Reinholtz’. Willem died on June 5th 1933 in Bergen op Zoom, 61 years old. He was a gardener servant at that time, and had never married. America wasn’t a success story for Willem. Or maybe he took over his father’s farm? Roeland Johannes van Nispen wasn’t mentioned again in the Bergen op Zoom archives since he was exempt for the draft on May 4th, 1914 because his brother already served in the military. It’s a bit ironic that that wasn’t an excuse in the US, or so it seems. On June 5th, 1917, just after the US joined WOI, he was mentioned on a US draft registration card as Roland van Nispen. At that time he was 22, butcher (the same profession he had at home) and wasn’t essential as breadwinner for a family member, which isn’t odd because he didn’t have any family in the US. Roeland lived in Moorhead, Minnesota at that moment, on 4th Street North 123. Moorhead is located on the Red River of the North, across the river from Fargo, the largest city in North Dakota. Moorhead was the destination ofLaurens van Mansfeld, so it wasn’t a coincidence Roeland ended up there. Roeland went back and forth twice. On May 24th 1916 he lived in Moorhead and had Ant’ van Nispen and Jean Badis as acquaintances. And on the 22nd of May 1922, his acquaintances were Jack Moorhead and F. Wakhee, his brother-in-law who lived in Harderwijk. On that date he also lived in Moorhead, on 4th Street 223. I didn’t find any mention of him after 1922.\n\nWalter’s brother-in-law Johannes Walterus Langenberg returned to Bergen op Zoom on February 14th 1920, coming from New York. He was a merchant in vegetables and fruit at that time and went on to live on Sint Antoniusstraat 23. It is remarkable he returned alone. And indeed: on June 17th 1920 he married Catharina Petronella Musters in Bergen op Zoom. She was forty, daughter of Cornelis Musters and Helena Nuijten and widow of Jacobus Withagen. That can only mean that Walter’s sister Maria had passed in the US. In the papers that were added to the marriage certificate, more information can be found. Dutch law obligated Jan to prove he was a widower. He contacted general consul John Vennema for this, working at the Dutch consulate in Chicago. Vennema made clear in April 1920 that he trusted a statement that was to be retrieved by John Murphy, notary for Grand Forks county. This notary Murphy had set out to the pastor of Reynolds for proof. And that proof was given: [this quote was translated into dutch first and re-translated into english]\n\n“Priest F.A. Meyer, pastor of the parish of Our Lady of Everlasting Support in Reynolds, North Dakota, declared after taking an oath that misses Maria Langenberg has passed in Reynolds, North Dakota, US, on September 25th, 1917 and was buried in Reynolds, North Dakota, in his presence on September 27th, 1917.”\n\nThis seems ample proof, but it wasn’t. The priest mentioned Mrs. Langenberg, instead of using her maiden name Withagen, which was usual in the US, on the lists of Ellis Island Maria was also called Langenberg. But this wasn’t customary in the Netherlands. Thus followed, and it can hardly be a surprise for any Dutch people, a somewhat typical Dutch bureaucratic procedure. One attachment to the marriage certificate was a letter from the Breda court. They got involved because the Bergen op Zoom marriage official refused to certify the marriage because he could not see the surname ‘Withagen’ in the statement from the American priest. On top of that was the fact that the priest had written something by hand in the catholic wedding book of Jan and Maria, which the official found to be suspicious. The Breda court attorney lined up the passports and catholic wedding book, which wasn’t a rightful evidence for the Dutch government, and spoke of a habit in English speaking countries to use the married name instead of someone’s maiden name. He saw no problems. And on top of that came a letter from another attorney who understood the marriage official and was of opinion that the marriage could not take place. They ‘simply’ had to ask the consul to send someone to the Reynolds priest again, he wrote, to get the same statement but not with the surname Langenberg but the maiden name Withagen mentioned. The judge did not approve, and decided the proof they already had would do. Jan Langenberg was lucky he didn’t have to pay court fees because he was poor..\n\nAfter all of this, Jan Langenberg could go on with his marriage, and moved with his second wife and three stepchildren, which had coincidentally the same surname as his late first wife, to Koevoetstraat 11. On that address, son Johannes Cornelis Langenberg was born on June 9th, 1921. At the end of his life, Jan was a horticulture laborer. He passed away on October 26th, 1944, at the age of 64.\n\nWe return to Walter. I presume he also returned home in 1915, judging by the note in his military file. He still had to serve out his time. We find him again in the archives on a lovely day: his wedding day. Walter married on February 15, 1917 in Steenbergen with Anna Maria Buijzen. At that moment he was a farmer and lived in Bergen op Zoom. Witnesses were Leonard Johannes Buijzen, 26, carpenter, brother of the bride, living in the Steenbergen county, Marijn van Herel, fourty, laborer, cousin of the bride, living in the Steenbergen county, my great-great grandfather Adrianus Franken, fodder merchant, 43, living in Bergen op Zoom and Cornelis Bruijs, 43, hovenier, living in Bergen op Zoom.\n\nSome background information about the Buijzen family. Anna Maria was born on November 14 1887 at 1am on the address E22 in Steenbergen county, which points to the nearby village of Welberg. Witnesses at the birth registration were Daniël van Agtmaal, 34, laborer, Cornelis Antonius van der Riet, 26, cigar maker, both of them living in Steenbergen county. She was a daughter of Leendert Buijzen and Laurina Dekkers. Leendert was born on September 30th, 1856 in Steenbergen as son of carpenter Leendert Buijzen (*Steenbergen county, 14/7-1821, ✞ yonder, 31/7-1884) and former maid Maria Cornelia Laanen (*Wouw, 22/12-1823, ✞Bergen op Zoom, 10/6-1891). Laurina was born on January 8th, 1853 in Steenbergen, daughter of laborers Marijn Dekkers (*Roosendaal, 11/2-1801, ✞ Steenbergen county, 26/1-1889) and Anna van Reijen (baptized in Steenbergen, 17/9-1810, ✞ yonder, 8/3-1880). On January 28th, 1887 Leendert and Laurina married in Steenbergen, with announcements on the 16th and 23rd of January that year. Witnesses were Ludovicus Adrianus Tholhuijsen, 31, house painter, brother-in-law of the groom, Frederik Pieter van Alphen, 71, agent, cousin-in-law of the groom, Willem Marcelis de Vos, 54, barman and Jan Baptist de Vree, 34, barman, brother-in-law of the groom. All the witnesses lived in Steenbergen county, in the Steenbergen or Kruisland villages. Remember the last name of De Vree, it will return further on in this article.\n\nSo daughter Anna Maria was born later in 1887 on the address E22. Neighbourhood E was located, according to the Steenbergen population register of 1889, ‘the whole Oudeland and the Welberg, including ‘den Bergschen weg going from the Ligne and the Olmendreef’.) The house E22 was in Welberg, but wasn’t inhabited by Leendert Buijzen at that time, nor was it his property. The civil registration shows that the Buijzen family lived on E41 and E24 in the period 1887-1900, in that respective order. In the 1889 neighbourhood population list, Leendert can be found living on number 41, also in Welberg. He lived there but the house was owned by the widow of Adr’ Wijnen. Leendert did own the next door houses of 41a and 41b, but those were inhabited by Jan Baartmans and Jan Bastiaanse respectively. In the period from 1900 onwards the family lived on E24, E49 and E55. Noted was that they were ‘written out’ of the register at the time of the 10th Dutch census. On March 23rd, 1890, the second child of the Buijsen-Dekkers couple was born, son Leonard Johannes Buijzen. That was at 11am on the address E21. Witnesses present at the birth registration were Kornelis Jan Raats, 33, carpenter and Cornelis Antonius van der Riet, 29, cigar maker, both living within Steenbergen county. I’ll refer to Leonard later on as brother-in-law, Leonard’s surname spelled as ‘Buijsen’.\n\nWalter and Anna Maria were registered in Welberg, neighbourhood E number 55, on November 7, 1917. That was the same day their daughter Laurina Maria Withagen was born, which was at the same address at 9:30am. The birth registration was done by father Walter Withagen, at that moment thirty and laborer, with witnesses Frans Pieter Bogers, 73, barman and grandfather Leendert Buijzen, 61, carpenter, all living in Steenbergen county. It seems that E55 was located in the ‘de Overval’ township, north of Welberg according to the neighbourhood registration list of 1915. A few days after Laurina’s birth, Walter left Steenbergen, he returned to Bergen op Zoom on November 13, 1917. His wife and daughter followed him on November 24th, 1917. In Bergen op Zoom, they lived at Auvergnestraat 6, until September 24th, 1918, when they all went back again to the Steenbergen neighbourhood E, living over there on E52 this time. At that address their second daughter was born: Maria Leonardus, on January 30th, 1919 at 7am. It seems they wanted to name their daughter after grandfather Leendert, but used the masculine form of the name.\n\nSomewhere around this time, a decision was made. Walter would try the US again. I can imagine the Steenbergen countryside of the 1910’s didn’t bring him the opportunities he had seen in the States. The opportunity of his own wooden house for example, with owned land around it, larger than Dutch people could even imagine. He still knew the group of Bergen op Zoom people he joined five years before, then living in Minnesota. He knew North Dakota well himself. He knew his way about and could think of a way he and his family could build their new lives at the other side of the ocean. And not only their lives: his brother-in-law Leonard Buijzen and his mother-in-law Laurina Buijzen-Dekkers were going with him. His father-in-law Leendert Buijzen seems to be living with his brother-in-law Jan Baptist de Vree in Kruisland at that moment. Jan Baptist de Vree married Leendert’s sister Adriana Cornela Buijzen on May 7th, 1880 in Halsteren. He himself was born in the Belgian village of Berendrecht, but came to Steenbergen as a minor when his mother remarried a Steenbergen man.\n\nAnna Maria sent this post card to her father on April 28th, at that time already living with J.B. de Vree in Kruisland. She tells him about how they arrived in Antwerp safe and soundl. She writes: “come soon, it is easy enough”. From Antwerpen, one could make the crossing to the US with the famous Red Star Line company, also called the ‘Société Anonyme de Navigation Belge-Américaine’. This company operated a shipping service to New York and sometimes to Philadelphia. In Antwerp, the family went aboard the SS Finland, an American-British ship built in 1902, owned by Red Star Line. On May 9th, they arrived on Ellis Island. Registered were Walter Withagen, farmer, 32, blond hair and blue eyes, his wife Johanna Withagen, 32, blond hair grey eyes, Laurina Withagen, two, blond hair blue eyes, Maria Withagen, one, blond hair blue eyes and Laurina Dekkers, 66, brown hair brown eyes. None of them had any physical problems. They had to name someone they left behind, which was again grandma Maria Withagen in Bergen op Zoom. And remarkably, the destination of the family was a friend, J. Langenberg in Southard, North Dakota. I cannot prove that J. Langenberg is Walter’s brother-in-law who I mentioned before. As far as I know he was living with his second wife in Bergen op Zoom at that moment.\n\nPresumably somewhere else on the ship was brother-in-law Leonard Buijsen. He arrived with the SS Finland on May 9, 1920, a note that was rewritten to May 10th, 1920. He also gave up J. Langenberg as a destination, in ‘Southark’, North Dakota. Most remarkable is that Willem Klaassen was also aboard! I already found out that Willem didn’t end up in the US, but he apparently travelled back and forth again. Willem didn’t have J. Langenberg as destination but J.C. Akkerman, who I think is the same mr. Akkerman the group of Bergen op Zoom men went to in 1914.\n\nThe Withagen’s had Southard or Southark as their destination. A place called Sourthark doesn’t exist in North Dakota, and a short Google search on Southard only gives me the address of a pumpjack as a result. I’ve called the North Dakota State Archive in Bismarck for this, and they told me the destination was probably understood wrongly by the Ellis Island officials. They thought it could be Sourth Heart. South Heart is located in Stark county, in the southwestern part of the state, closer to the Rocky Mountains. However, they didn’t stay very long in ‘Southard’, it isn’t even sure for me if they ever arrived there. Not long after this L.J. Buijsen, the brother-in-law, sent a postcard to Kruisland from Hillsboro, North Dakota. Hillsboro is located in Traill county, and I recognize this county as the one located under Grand Forks in eastern North Dakota. Wikipedia describes it as a ‘bedroom community’ halfway between two larger metropolitan areas: Greater Grand Forks and Fargo-Moorhead.At the postcard it says ‘filling the silo on Elmwood Farm, Hillsboro N.D.’ Elmwood is the name of a cemetery close to Hillsboro, on the other side of the Goose River. The farm was maybe located somewhere nearby. Moreover these places are all located about 32 kilometers from Reynolds, and that isn’t a coincidence. There were presumably a lot of acquaintances living in the area, and I can imagine Walter and brother-in-law Leonard worked at farms in the area alternately.\n\nIn September 1920, grandfather Leendert Buijsen came to live with the family. I cannot find any document about his emigration anywhere, but I’m certain he did come, mostly because of a third postcard sent to J.B. de Vree on September 30, 1920, in which Anna Maria tells De Vree about her father’s trip:\n\n“Dear family, with this card I wanted to let you know that father arrived well, and we were all happy to see him again. The journey also went well. Father Koeman brought him home to us. He looks very well and Auntie, thanks a lot for your goods en for the children. Father will write you a letter when he’s at ease. Furthermore best whises from us all and especially from Father.”\n\nA few days later, on October 2nd 1920, another postcard was sent. Grandpa Leendert was working for the local pastor and seems to get used to living in the US pretty well.\n\n“Dear family, with this card I wanted to let you know that Father is so happy here. It is better than he expected and is having a good time here. He already started working at the Pastor’s farm. And father (..) is already coming, it always arrives two days later. The Pastor has had those from Auntie early. (..) the Pastor is coming to the Netherlands on All Soul’s Day again and the month after that. Best wishes for all of you.”\n\nUpside down was written: “the other is Hillsboro, N.D. North America, a letter is coming, this is our church and our rectory.” That church does not exist anymore. The website of the parish describes how the catholic community in this region was made up of mostly Irishmen, and later of catholic Germans. In Hillsboro, there’s an episcopal church, which means Anglican, and two Lutheran churches, that serve the large Norwegian community. The church seen under this part of the article is the Saint Rosa of Lima church, built in 1915. It was quite new when Walter and Anna Maria came there. It was demolished in 1977 and replaced by a new church (of, I would say, American size) at the south side of the village. The parish also writes about how there wasn’t a pastor until 1915, when they hired one from Reynolds. And that could be the before mentioned pastor Meyer that buried Walter’s sister in 1917. Anyhow, the first pastor of Hillboro was father Koelman, about whom Anna Maria writes in her letter from September 30, 1920.\n\nSometime in the winter of 1920/1921, the family moved eastward, to Minnesota. Walter is mentioned in a list of taxpayers over 1921 (at the top of the second column), in the Finnish language newspaper ‘Uusi Kotimaa’, dated January 24, 1922. From the 19th century onwards, local newspapers written in the language of a certain community were usual, and quite a large community of Finnish emigrants lived in Minnesota and the northern parts of Wisconsin and Michigan. In the phone call with the Bismarck archive I had, I learned what townships are. A state is divided into counties, counties are divided into townships and townships are divided into sections with a size of one square mile each. About 160 kilometers southeast of Hillsboro lies Otter Tail county, that’s in the state of Minnesota. The main thing I knew about Minnesota was the city of Minneapolis, being the home city of Prince. Located west of the Great Lakes, the state is a lot older than the Dakotas, it joined the union in 1858, so before the civil war.\n\nOtter Tail county is located in the western part of the state, in a landscape that characterizes itself by a lot of farmland, low-height deciduous forests and lakes, all cultured in a systematic manner facing north. Like in North Dakota, there’s a continental climate with warm summers and very cold winters. There are 58.812 people in the county, which is a little bit less than the population of Bergen op Zoom, but on a surface which is a few hundred square kilometers bigger than the whole surface of North Brabant. Paddock township has 323 inhabitants. It was founded in 1882 and named after the owner of a saw mill, L.A. Paddock. Located around Paddock are Butler township with 315 inhabitants, founded in 1883 and named after local government man Stephen Butler, and Sebeka, a town in Wadena county, about fifteen kilometers from Paddock. Sebeka has 675 inhabitants nowadays, and already had a center function for the region in the 1920’s. The name ‘Sebeka’ seems to be of Native American origin, maybe it is derived from a Ojibweg word, the language of the aboriginals of this area. The fact Walter and his family came to live in this area is, again, not a coincidence. The nearby township of Butler was the residence of mr. Van den Heuvel in 1910, when Laurens van Mansfeld, the first Bergen op Zoom man from the group went to live with him. This points out the fact that the contacts with acquaintances were still alive in 1921. On September 30, 1921, their third daughter Anna F. or Anna Alima Withagen was born in their new residence.\n\nIn the years that followed, the family made their home in Minnesota. Father Walter, mother Anna Maria, grandparents Leendert sr. and Laurina and daughters Maria, Laurina and Anna in one spot, with brother-in-law Leonard jr. living in the neighbouring area. The family owned a farm with land, according to the list of taxpayers from the 1922 newspaper. We can see the farm in some detail in the photo below. This picture was probably attached to a postcard Leendert Buijsen sr. sent in 1924 to his sister and brother-in-law in Kruisland. I don’t know how exactly he did that: all the postcards I have from this period were stamped separately, which means there wasn’t an envelope to enclose them. That would mean the series of postcards isn’t complete, or that the photo was sent to another family member in the Kruisland area and ended up there. I’m sure grandma Withagen, my 3rd great-grandmother, also received some cards in the years before her passing away in 1927.\n\nIt seems the family was already making plans to move elsewhere in 1925. The problem is that the civil registration in the US was done in a different manner than they do over here: there’s a census every ten years. There was a census last year, for example. That means one’s searching ‘snapshots’ instead of an ongoing registration of moving dates and addresses. Birth certificates aren’t always available. Overall it means that sometimes I have to guess the intent of the documents I could find. The postcards make it easier, but it’s still hard to prove things in detail. Anyway, the family travelled to the Netherlands somewhere in 1925 or 1926 for a family visit, and it seems they didn’t return to Minnesota but to a new residence in Wisconsin. It also seems grandpa Leendert did not come with them, and stayed in the Netherlands for some time. The trip back to the US was on March 31, 1926 (the postcard stamp says April 1). The family booked a crossing aboard the ‘Paris’, a French ship that departed from the Normandy harbor city of Le Havre. That must have been quite a big train ride from Bergen op Zoom. The ‘Paris’ is depicted, with description, on the cards the kids sent to their grandpa in Kruisland. (Image source: D. Koevoets)\n\nThe family arrived on Ellis Island on April 8. Registered were Waltherus Withagen, 39, farmer, with his wife Johanna Withagen, 38, housewife, daughter Laurina Withagen, eight, Maria Withagen, seven, Anna Alima Withagen, four and brother-in-law Leonard Buijsen, 36, farmer. There was a stamp placed at the note of Laurina and Maria saying ‘under 10’. Another stamp was placed at the note of Anna Alima, which is probably because she was the only family member born in the US and thus the only family member who was a American citizen at that time. As the one ‘they left behind’, brother-in-law Leonard mentioned father Buijsen in Kruisland, the others mentioned grandma Withagen. A very funny attempt was made to explain the spelling of her address, ‘Moeregrebstraat‘ to the US customs officer. It was written as ‘Moergrep St.’ eventually. They proclaimed their final destination was Sebeka, which was the nearest large town to Paddock township. However, I suspect this wasn’t really their final destination, although they stated Paddock was their hometown.\n\nGrandma Laurina Buijsen-Dekkers also went back with them. She isn’t mentioned on the Ellis Island passenger list, but when grandpa Leendert came back later, he stated he went back to his wife, which means she was already living in the US at that time. Besides, she was mentioned at an index list of arrived passengers in New York with her son Leonard jr. (see the fifth image below). Below are three postcards (source: D. Koevoets) which give a picture of how the journey went. When they arrived in New York, two cards were mailed, one they took with them from France empty with wishes from granddaughter Anna, the other with wishes from daughter Anna Maria. She wrote:\n\n“Most loved father and family, we all arrived well. When we have a home spot we will write to you about the journey, but for now, we don’t know an adress yet. Many regards from all of us, take care.”\n\nThey didn’t have an address yet! Now, it could be that she meant a resting spot to stay overnight, but later cards point out that Anna Maria was indeed talking about a new living address in Wisconsin. On April 13, 1926, the family arrived in Chicago. Brother-in-law Leonard wrote:\n\n“Dear father and family, we’re in Chicago at the moment. I’ll send you a letter in a few days. Many regards, L. Buijsen.”\n\nI’ll write about the post cards some more. The last five cards I have weren’t sent from Minnesota, but from Wisconsin. On June 5, 1926, two cards were mailed and stamped in Kimberly, a suburb of Appleton. I’ll tell you more about those places later on. Anyhow, it seems that the family had moved to Appleton in the meantime. On June 5, 1926, a few weeks after arrival, daughters Anneke, Marie en Lois wrote a card to their grandfather in Kruisland. Depicted are the main streets of Appleton and the Wisconsin river. They wrote:\n\n“Grandpa, there are lots of children here to play with, but I’d rather go to the woods with you to pick berries. Take care and see you soon, Marie”\n\nand,\n\n“Grandpa, I’m doing well. When I grow up, I’ll come and visit you, so take care. Anneke.”\n\nand,\n\n“Grandpa, I’m doing my best at school and we are with good nuns. Take care, so that we can see eachother again. Lois.”\n\nAlong with the message on the third postcard, mother Anna Maria asked her father if he could send her an ‘oil stone’. These three cards are, to be honest, a bit of an emotional part of this story. A fourth card goes out on July 10, 1926. It was sent from Kimberly, Wisconson, and depicted Chicago central station. It was written in the name of daughter Anneke, and is about how Leendert sr. himself had visited that station (in 1920), and how they wished he came over as well. The remarkable thing about that card is that it seems to be the only one of the bunch written by Walter Withagen. His Dutch name Wouter is known because of this card. From all these postcards, we can conclude that it wasn’t certain that their grandparents would join them again. But happily not much later, they did.\n\nGrandpa Leendert left for the US on August 11, 1926, with the ship the ‘Volendam’, in service of the Rotterdam Holland-America Line. At that time, Leendert was 69 and a carpenter. It was mentioned that he had lived in Sebeka, Minnesota, left behind his cousin J. de Vree and went to visit his wife ‘Laulina Buysen’ in Sebeka. He did not have a ticket for his inland journey, but did carry more than fifty dollars. It is remarkable that Sebeka was still mentioned as a residence in 1926: it’s quite clear the family already settled in Wisconsin earlier. Leendert was detained for special inquiry when arriving on Ellis Island. This could be for a lot of reasons, it mainly happened with pregnant women or women travelling alone. The abbreviation ‘PHY D PC’ was used. ‘Phy’ seems to point to physical, I suspect they meant a sort of physical exam because he made the journey on his own at almost seventy years old. People were ‘old’ a little bit earlier than nowadays, and the Atlantic crossing was very exhausting. He was examined by inspector Johson and was served breakfast, lunch and dinner three times.\n\nThe last post card must have been bought I while back: it depicted an Antwerp scene. It was sent on August 28, 1926, from Kimberly, Wisconsin. Anna Maria wrote:\n\n“Dear uncle and aunt Neel, father has arrived well. A letter is coming. Many regards for all of you, especially from Father”\n\nThe family stayed in the same place for more than a year. On October 4, 1927, daughter Freida M. (or Frida) Withagen was born in Wisconsin. I think she was named after her grandfather Godefridus Withagen. Later that year, on December 19, 1927, Walter’s mother Maria Withagen died in her home at the Moeregrebstraat in Bergen op Zoom. He did not go back for the funeral.\n\nOne could say that after thirteen years, someone had really contributed to the US society. It was enough anyway to get American citizenship at that time. That happened in 1927. Walter and his brother-in-law Leonard jr. were naturalized on November 11, 1927, Anna Maria did November 9, 1928. On both the occasions, the address was R7 in Appleton, Wisconsin. According to the index, witnesses were M. van Grinsven, Anton Derks, John Boelhower and John Polman. And those are Dutch names, something to remember, as I’ll describe the Dutch community in Wisconsin later on. As far as I could find, Leendert sr. and his wife Laurina weren’t naturalized, and I think the citizenship process of daughters Maria and Laurina went automatically when their parents became US citizens.\n\nAs far as I can see, the naturalization process happened in a few steps. At the end, one certificate was written, after which the local court decided if someone was to become a US citizen. It is a bit like how a Dutch marriage came to be at that time: marriage announcements, followed by a list of requirements that had to be met, with proof, then finally the marriage. The process started with a declaration of intention. For naturalization, a prove of immigration via Ellis Island was needed, an interview taken by an acquaintance of the candidate who had to already be a US citizen. The documents give lots of information about appearance, background, professions and addresses. I’ll start with Walter. His intention declaration was served on May 14, 1923 in Traill county, North Dakota. In 1923 he was a laborer, 35, and resident of Hillsboro. His appearance was as follows: white skin with a light complexion, 1,77 meters long, his weight was 75 kilo, he had dark hair and blue eyes. He stated some facts about his place of birth and his marriage to ‘Johanna’ Buijsen, and declared not to be an anarchist or a believer in polygamy. Those last two items seem to be really important to the US government, as the same question was asked when arriving on Ellis Island. An important question in the declaration of intention was: [citation translated to Dutch and re-translated into English]\n\n“It is my sincere intention to forever renounce my loyalty to any foreign prince, state or souvereignity, especially to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, of whom I’m a subject at this time.”\n\nThat sounds kind of heavy but believe me when I say that most of them did not care at all about who they were a subject to. A naturalization was especially very practical. As witnesses Jacques Hendrickx, post office worker living in Butler, Otter Tail and Theodore Sweere, farmer, living at R4 in Perham, Minnesota, were called. They would declare about Walter’s character and about the time he lived in Minnesota in the exact period between July 1, 1922 and December 20, 1925. After all when this process came to be, the family already moved to Wisconsin. The head of the interview takers of the naturalization service in Saint Paul, the capital of Minnesota, delegated mr. J.W. Shea. Shea travelled to Perham and took the interview there on July 3, 1927, at 11am. Theodore was a farmer, 54, living in Butler, Minnesota, born in the Netherlands and a US citizen. He declared he first met Walter on his own farm in October 1920, and that according to his knowledge, Walter lived in the US from October 1920 to 1925. On the question about Walter’s place of residence he answered: “before I met him, he lived in North Dakota for a while. After 1920 he lived near (..).” Theodore saw Walter on a weekly basis and said he was of good moral and certainly recommended him as a citizen. The second witness, Jacques Hendrickx, 37, was a shopkeeper from Butler and also a Dutchman. He declared he met Walter in his shop in 1920 and saw him on a weekly basis thereafter. His answers correspond to those of Theodore Sweere.\n\nThe authorities came to no other conclusion than that Walter was well suited to be a US citizen. Everything checked out. In the final document, all kinds of facts were noted, from his date of birth to his date of marriage and when he came to the US. The most important fact to me in this document is the address: he lived in Buchanan, Outagamie county. His profession wasn’t laborer but ‘helper beater’. I’m not quite sure what that means, but it could mean something as ‘to float’, or maybe they meant someone who repairs damaged cars. The witnesses at the final court procedure, M. van Grinsven and Anton Derks (both living in Kimberly, Outagamie), were ‘head beaterman’ and ‘beater helper’ of profession respectively. Co-workers of Walter. It is clear that this job was quite a different one to the farming jobs Walter had before, which without a doubt had to do with them now living in a more city-like region.\n\nAt the same time, brother-in-law Leonard Buijsen appeared for the court. That was convenient. His documents are almost identical with that of Walter, which isn’t strange: they went on the same path since 1920. Leonard also lived in Buchanan, Outagamie, and was also a ‘helper beater’. They even had the same witnesses: Theodore Sweere and Jacques Hendrickx, and they gave the same answers about him as they did about Walter. They met Leonard on a farm or in the shop and saw him on a weekly basis. On May 16, 1928, Anna Maria went up for naturalization. Her file was smaller. Attached was a proof of immigration. In the final decision of the court, Buchanan, Outagamie was mentioned as a place of residence. Also mentioned were her children: Laurina, born November 7, 1917 in the Netherlands, Maria, born January 30, 1919 in the Netherlands, Annie, born September 30, 1921 in Sebeka, Minnesota and Godfrida, born October 4, 1927 in Appleton, Wisconsin. Anna Maria declared to be married to Walter Withagen, a US citizen. Witnesses at the court hearing were John Boelhower, laborer, and John Polman, laborer, both living in Kimberly, Outagamie.\n\nThe small town of Butler, next to Paddock in Otter Tail county, where Leonard and Walter met the people that would later be witnesses for them, seems to have more of a Dutch characteristic than one would expect. Theodorus Johannes Sweere was born in 1872 in Oploo, in the North Brabant county of Sint-Anthonis. He was a farmer in Minnesota in the 1920’s and would later move westward: he passed away in Carrington, North Dakota in 1942. Sweere was married to Johanna Maria van den Heuvel (1864-1926) from Cuijk, and that surname is striking, because a certain Van den Heuvel in Butler was the destination of Laurens van Mansfeld at the beginning of this story. On the Holy Cross cemetery in Butler, a lot of inhabitants with a Dutch background are buried, among whom a lot of Sweere family members (it seems not the whole family went to North Dakota), but no Van den Heuvels’ except for the before mentioned ms. Sweere-van den Heuvel. Jacques Antoine Hendrickx was the oldest child of twelve from the couple Johannes Josephus Hubertus Hendrickx (1862-1928) x Maria Margaretha Timmermans (1862-1937). He came from Venlo, she from the Northern Limburg village of Beesel. The whole family emigrated to the US in 1910, and lived in 1927 in Butler, where Jacques was a shopkeeper, for about fifteen years.\n\nThere is some background information to be found about the Wisconsin witnesses. All of them were also Dutch-Americans of catholic faith. The first witness is probably Martin van Grinsven (1891-1979) from the North Brabant town of Herpen. He was married to Johanna Wilhelmina van den Hoogen (1893-1957), also from Herpen, but the marriage was in 1914 in Kimberly, so he had lived in the US for quite a while. Then there’s Anton Derks, which I could not link to any documents. I did find a Derks family that lived in this area for a long time, starting with Henry Derks (1806-1887), who came from the German-Dutch border town of Zyfflich, close to Nijmegen. He emigrated in 1848 and has lived in Wisconsin since about 1850. A Boelhower family from Amstelveen lived in Kimberly around 1928. One of the family sons was Johannes Bernardus Antonius Boelhower (1905-1987), a priest in a monastery in Kimberly. He could be witness to John Boelhower, but that witness was mentioned as a laborer in 1928. The last witness was John Polman (1902-1959). Polman lived in Wisconsin in 1928, but was married to Johanna Helena Maria Cornelia (Ann) Sweere (1906-1995), born in Butler, Minnesota. She was a daughter of the couple Hendricus Hubertus (Henry) Sweere (1874-1949) x Wilhelmina van den Heuvel (1872-1946) from Oploo and Cuijk. Henry was a brother of the first witness Theodore Sweere. These connections are no coincidence, I’m almost sure the Withagens’ knew all these people and I think they moving eastward in the course of the 1920’s, 1930’s and 1940’s has to do with them.\n\nSomewhere between November 1928 and January 1930, the family moved back to Paddock, Minnesota. On April 18, 1930, they were visited there by a census official. The census gives a fine overlook on the family in that year. I can imagine the reader of this article can get a little bit lost in all the names and dates, so I made a clear summary, with the names written in the American form.\n\nWaltherus, Wouter, or Walter Withagen, head of the family, man, white, 43, 30 when married, farmer, citizen, born in the Netherlands, first in the US in 1914.\n\nAnna Maria (Anna) Withagen, spouse, woman, white, 42, 29 when married, no profession, citizen, born in the Netherlands, first time in the US in 1920.\n\nLaurina Maria (Lorraine, Marie or Lois) Withagen, daughter, woman, white, twelve, school pupil, not a citizen, born in the Netherlands, first time in the US in 1920.\n\nMaria Leonardus (Mary, Marie or Lois) Withagen, daughter, woman, white, eleven, school pupil, not a citizen, born in the Netherlands, first time in the US in 1920.\n\nAnna Alima (Annie, Anneke) Withagen, daughter, woman, white, eight, school pupil who hadn’t learn how to read or write yet, born in Minnesota, citizen.\n\nFreida M. (Frida) Withagen, daughter, woman, white, two, not yet going to school, born in Wisconsin, citizen.\n\nLeendert (Leonard) Buijsen, father-in-law, man, white, 74, 30 when married, able to read and write, no profession, born in the Netherlands, first in the US in 1920, not a citizen.\n\nLaurina (Lorraine) Buijsen, mother-in-law, woman, white, 76, 32 when married, not able to read or write, no profession, born in the Netherlands, first in the US in 1920, not a citizen.\n\nLeonardus (Leonard) Buijsen, brother-in-law, man, white, 40, unmarried, able to read and write, farming laborer, born in the Netherlands, first time in the US in 1920, citizen.\n\nThey lived in a farm which was owned by Walter. They didn’t have a radio set. All those who were born in the Netherlands had parents that were also born in the Netherlands. The census gives a nice overview on their direct environment: their neighbours. We can read about the large family of Benjamin and Sofia Samuelson; he was born in Minnesota as a son of Finnish immigrants, she was also Finnish but born in Norway. Another large family was that of Oscar and Hilja Ewasti. Both of them were Finnish and emigrated in the 1910’s. A little further lived the old age couple of Leon and Mary Jacob, he was born in France, she was also french but was born in Minnesota. Their son married an American woman and lived next door. Next we have John S. and Ella Thon of Norwegian and Irish-New-Jersey background. They were seniors and lived with their son Morris and their 15 year old granddaughter from Oklahoma. Then there were two couples, an older couple of John and Nettie R. Rayeroft, he was from Canada with roots in New York and Ireland, she was from Minnesota with roots in Connecticut and New York, and a younger couple, Elmer and Josephine Vitt with a mixed Russian-German ancestry. In short: quite a usual mix of background of a midwest town: Germans en Irish, with a variety of other ancestries. With the exception that in this region, the Scandinavian influence was quite big, and the Finnish community seemed to be growing in the 1930’s. Remarkable is that the naturalizations show a Dutch-American community in Butler, but not in Paddock, according to the census.\n\nI’ll try to give an image of what happened to the Withagen family in the 1930’s, without being able to refer to postcards. The only thing I can use are some documents. Grandma Laurina died later on in 1930, on the 29th of June. She was 77 years old and was buried in the cemetery of the Holy Cross in Butler, Otter Tail, which was probably the nearest by catholic cemetery. The small tombstone mentions ‘Laurina Buysse’, in the burial registers, ‘Dekkere’ is noted, by which her maiden name Dekkers was meant. On January 7, 1932, their youngest child was born: Leonard N. Withagen. That was in Morrison county in Minnesota, a little further in the Minneapolis direction. In the 1940 census, a column was included in which the residence of five years before was noted. That way, I know that the family lived in Outagamie, Wisconsin, in 1935. They moved back and forth between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nIt is probable that the family lived in Black Creek in 1935, a town in Outagamie county at about 33 kilometers from Kimberly, the village they lived in at the end of the 1920’s. Black Creek is the town where grandpa Leendert Buijsen passed away on February 1st, 1939, at the age of 82. He was buried at the catholic Saint Mary’s cemetery in Black Creek, with his name written on his tombstone as ‘Leenderd’, the Dutch way. 1940 was a very important year for the family, but it must have been a sad year as well, because the grandparents had been with them since the beginning of their journey. Two articles from the local newspaper Appleton Post-Crescent give some insights. The first article is dated January 15, 1940, and is about daughter Lorrain. She got engaged to George McCarthy. A party was thrown to celebrate their engagement. The hostesses were the wife of Sylvester Smits and the wife of Leonard Jochman, both sisters of George. The article mentioned that they would marry two days later, on January 17. Visitors could win prizes, and the winners were the wife of Edwin Cooney, Bernice Jochman, Lorrain Duffek, ms. M. McCarthy, the wife of Ray Feuerstein, the wife of Leonard Jochman and Marie Withagen. Furthermore, Miss Mary Jochman, the wife of R. Kornely, Miss Anna Withagen, Miss Loraine Withagen, the wife of Vincent Eichstadt, Miss Lucile McCarthy and Miss Orlean Kolberg were present. I’ll write a lot more about the Withagen children further on in this article.\n\nA second article is dated April 4, 1940. A game hunting club submitted an application for 1250 pheasant chicks, which was awarded. A somewhat weird list of personal facts about members of the club followed. They wrote about the annual party of the hunting clubs, which took place in what I assume was the local evangelical church. Then something was written about the birth of twins and about some people moving. The article finished with:\n\n“W.J. Ganzel sold his 80-acre farm on Highway 47 to Edward Zuleger, route 1, wednesday. The Walter Withagen family is returning to Minnesota this week, their former home. They lived on the Ganzel farm.\n\nHighway 47 still exists: Wisconsin Highway 47 was meant here. Highway 47 was built by the state and runs through Black Creek. In the 1940 census, William Ganzel, 53 years old, lived there with his wife Margaret, fifty, and nephew Vernon Blake, 23. Ganzel was born in Wisconsin in a family with probably a German background. A Carl Theodor Friedrich Christopher Ganzel, born in Kosbad, grand-duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1826, came to Wisconsin before 1867 and died in 1901 in Cicero, Outagamie.\n\nLater on in 1940, the census people came around again. That was after the family moved back to Minnesota. Noted family members were:\n\nWalter Withagen, 55, head of the family, married, born in the Netherlands, lived in Outagamie county in 1935, working on a farm.\n\nAnna Withagen, 52, wife, white, married, born in the Netherlands, lived in Outagamie county in 1935.\n\nMarie B. Withagen, 21, daughter, white, not married, born in the Netherlands, lived in Outagamie county in 1935.\n\nAnna E. Withagen, 18, daughter, white, not married, born in Minnesota, lived in Outagamie county in 1935.\n\nFreda M. Withagen, twelve, daughter, white, born in Wisconsin, lived in Outagamie county in 1935.\n\nLeonard R. Withagen, eight, son, white, born in Minnesota, lived in Outagamie county in 1935.\n\nThe family became significantly smaller compared to the 1930 census. Oldest daughter Lorraine was married and stayed in Wisconsin. Grandpa and grandma passed away, and brother-in-law Leonard is also not mentioned as a family member. The location of the farm they lived on is remarkable. It was located in Orrock township in Sherburne county. Sherburne is, compared to Otter Tail, located more in the center of Minnesota, between the larger cities of Saint Cloud and Minneapolis. The landscape is hilly with lots of pine forests, alternated with some lakes and rivers. The census points to section 27 of Orrock township, which makes the square on the map where their home was clear. They lived about nine kilometers from Big Lake, a town at the Mississippi riverside. Orrock itself is quite a large township, with a population of 2764 in the year 2000.\n\nLater that year, on September 27, 1940, Walter Withagen passed away in Sherburne county or in the vicinity of the nearby town Big Lake. A variety of sources support this date. A death certificate was written, in which name, place and date were noted. This certificate is attached to the Minnesota Health Department Death Register over 1908-2002. Two indexes also mention the certificate: one on Familysearch and one on the Minnesota Historical Society website. Walter was just 53 years old. He was buried on October 1, 1940 in the Holy Cross cemetery in Butler, so about 180 kilometers away. This was the cemetery in which his mother-in-law found her last resting place, and the family knew the town of Butler well. It seems like the family had planned to stay in Orrock for a longer time, to maybe do some farm work, like they did in Paddock and Black Creek. But without their family head, it didn’t go through. The family would return once again to Wisconsin, and this time for good.\n\nA little bit about Wisconsin. I mentioned Outagamie a few times, and some place names. On the western shore of Lake Michigan lies the state of Wisconsin, founded in 1848. Wisconsin is known in the US mainly for their snow. The winters are freezing cold, there is a continental climate. It is a very green state nonetheless, with lots of forests and lots of lakes. One of the smaller lakes is Lake Winnebago. Lake Michigan and Lake Winnebago are connected to each other by the Fox River that flows into Lake Michigan at the big city of Green Bay.\n\nAround Lake Winnebago lived the Fox (Meskwaki), Sauk, Kickapoo and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) tribes originally. These three tribes are connected to each other, they speak the Algonquian Fox language. The Algonquian languages form quite a large Native-American language family, that stretches to modern-day Mexico. The languages of the Cree, Blackfoot, Cheyenne and the Mohicans also belong to this language family, for example. On the other side of the lake lived the Winnebago tribe, after which the lake was named. They call themselves the Ho-Chunk: Winnebago is a word from the Fox language, while their language belongs to the West-Siouxan language family, that stretches along the Mississippi all the way to Louisiana. The first European in the area was the Norman explorer Jean Nicolet. He discovered Lake Michigan and arrived for the first time in 1634 in what would later be Wisconsin. He later became the French ambassador to the Ho-Chunk, an alliance benefitting for trade. Explorer Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette boated quite a distance on the Fox river in 1673. They discovered lots of small lakes between the mouth of the Fox river and the Mississippi. If a group was able to go a few short distances by foot, the lakes could be used as a kind of waterway between the two rivers, and thus as a connection between the French colonies of New France (Québec) and Louisiana.\n\nFor centuries, the Great Lakes area, or certainly the western part of it, was influenced by the french. They built their colony in Québec and trappers and traders flocked inland. Along the route discovered by Jolliet and Marquette, trading posts were built in the 17th century. A small French community arose, where the men married native women frequently. They call that ‘métis’ in Canada. The trappers had employed engagés or voyageurs, adventurous men that went further inland from the trade posts to hunt and trade with native tribes. In 1803, Napoleon sold the whole of Louisiana to the US, so also present-day Wisconsin. That didn’t mean the end of the French character of the area, something that can be seen in a lot of place names in the current US midwest. For example Eau Claire, Des Moines, Saint-Louis, Fond du Lac or Prairie du Chien.\n\nThe metropolitan area I’ll describe is the area of the Fox Cities. The main part of the metropolitan area lies at the bottom of the Fox River, at the shores of Lake Winnebago. Main city is Appleton, with Greenville, Little Chute, Kimberly, Kaukauna, Buchanan, Harrison, Menasha and Neenah as suburbs. The biggest part of Appleton is located within Outagamie county. Outagamie was founded in 1851 and 1852, three years after Wisconsin’s accession to the union. The county is square, and that’s simply because of how this part of the US is subdivided. At that time, there wasn’t given any thought of course to where a big city would arise, and that’s why some Appleton suburb-towns are located in Winnebago county and Calumet county. ‘Outagamie’ is a french language version of the Fox word ‘Anishinaabe’ which means ‘people living on the other side of the stream’. I really cannot imagine how the French came up with the ‘Outagamie’ version of that word, but OK. Together with Oshkosh, the Fox cities have a population of almost 400.000. I made a map to keep the overview on all of this. The orange lines signal the city limits, the red lines are the county borders.\n\nThe fact that Appleton and surrounding area were part of French Louisiana, that there were European trappers in the area and that the whole region was sold to the US didn’t mean that the US ‘had control’ over the area at the beginning of the 19th century. The Menominee and Ho-Chunk still ruled the area. It was US policy to relocate east coast Native-Americans to reservations in the midwest. The notorious ‘trail of tears’ happened in the 1830’s. The Oneida, Brothertown and Mohican tribes had to move from Massachusetts/New York to new reservations in Wisconsin. But other tribes were already living there. In 1836, the treaty of the Cedars was signed between the US federal government and chief Oshkosh of the Menominee tribe. With this treaty, the Oneida reservation was founded in Outagamie, which still exists to this day. The treaty cleared the way for further development of the area. Appleton was founded in 1847. That same year, there was also a university built, and the city was named after the father-in-law of the founder of that university: Samuel Appleton. The city developed in a similar way to other cities in the state. Important were the paper industry and a power plant, and Appleton was a precursor in the midwest in street lighting and telephone connections. A progressive city, all and all, with anno 2021 a population of 72.000 inhabitants, which is a little bit more than live in Bergen op Zoom. Also important to mention: Appleton is one of the 25 best cities in the US to live in.\n\nEast of Appleton, on the southern Fox River side, Kimberly was located: the village where the Withagen family resided when they went to Wisconsin for the first time. Kimberly was called ‘the Cedars’ in earlier times, after which the treaty of the Cedars that I mentioned before was called. In 1889, it was renamed to Kimberly after one of the founders of the paper factory, John Alfred Kimberly. Walter also lived in Buchanan. Buchanan was a town, but not in the sense of a village or city, but in the sense of a section: a township like Paddock. It was a rural area, although a township was located within it: Darboy. Buchanan had a population of 5827 in the year 2000. Nearby Kaukauna is a bit larger, with 16.000 inhabitants. This town is exceptional because it is where a bit of the earliest history of the area can be found. French missionary father Claude-Jean Allouez wrote about Kaukauna in the 1670’s. He wrote about Native-Americans and how they owned apple orchards and vineyards. Dominique du Charme bought 518 acres of land from the same tribe in 1793, in exchange for two barrels of rum and some small stuff. That land would later become the Kaukauna center. On the land, a Green Bay trading network outpost was built. This outpost was inhabited by Augustin Grignon from 1813 onwarts. He inherited it from his father. Grignon was a Métis, like his wife Nancy McCrea, who was a daughter of a Scottish-Canadian trader and a granddaughter of an important Menominee indian. His inheritance, together with the land Grignon bought from Du Charme (who even was one of the signatories of the treaty of the Cedars), was formed into a large estate that became well known as a resting place. The ‘Mansion in the Woods’ where they lived still exists today, it is the oldest building of Wisconsin.\n\nThe book ‘Land of the Fox, Saga of Outagamie county’ from 1949 described a lot about the origin of Appleton and surrounding cities, along with a beautiful story about the Grignon family). It seems Kaukauna’s origin was somewhat separate from that of Appleton and her university. I read somewhere that in the 1840’s everything west of Milwaukee was still a wilderness. An overview of Kaukauna’s origin gives a summary of the city council in 1842. Compared to the council members a hundred years later, in 1949, many differences in the members’ background can be seen. At the time of the founding of the town, men like Charles Grignon, Bazile H. Beaulieux, Hoel S. Wright, Lewis Crofoot and Charles Maites were members. Definitely a French influence. In 1949, members were Walter Riemer, the wife of Arnold Deering, Edward Kieffer, Alvin Lemke, Joseph van de Loo, Peter Farrell, Frank Meulemans and Theodore van Vreede.\n\nLittle Chute is a remarkable town; it was founded by a Brabantian priest and became sort of a gathering spot for East Brabant immigrants, mainly originating from Uden. Maybe this was the start of the waves of hundreds of catholic Dutchmen, mainly from Brabant and Twente, settling in and around Appleton. Quite a big community. And because of these facts, I’ve to tell you all about something that annoys me. On the other side of Lake Michigan lie Holland and Zeeland; founded by reformed Dutchmen from the north. When something is told about Dutch-Americans here in the Netherlands, it is always about Holland, Michigan. From the RTL News to visits of the king. They never talk about the Wisconsin community, because over there are less windmills, less wooden shoes and less pancakes. In short: it is less of an amusement park. An example of north-Dutch arrogance can even be seen across the Atlantic.\n\nWe return to the year 1940. The American story I’m telling continues, and I’ll tell it in separate parts from here on, so that I can give some more background about the different groups of immigrated Americans and their communities. There will be less focus on the Withagen children, and for a simple reason: less information can be found about their later years. As is in the Netherlands, privacy laws make it harder to find ‘younger’ documents and information, although it is easier in the US. I’ll begin with mother Anna Maria, her third daughter Anna Alima (Anneke) Withagen and her brother Leonard Buijsen. After that, I’ll write about the other children, their family-in-law and their background. The order is:\n\nWithagen-Buijsen, Buijsen, Withagen\n\nLorraine Withagen x McCarthy\n\nMarie Withagen x Jeske\n\nFreida Withagen x Swiechowski\n\nLeonard Withagen x Ciha\n\nWithagen-Buijsen, Buijsen, Withagen\n\nAnna Maria and her brother Leonard appear in the archives again in 1942. The US had gotten involved in WOII in 1941, and folks were busy registering potential conscripts. On April 26, 1942, a draft card was made for brother-in-law Leonard. It was a special card, meant for man born between roughly 1877 and 1897. They were a bit older, and would have been a reservist rather than going into active duty. Leonard lived in Paddock the moment the card was made, but had a mailbox in nearby Sebeka. He was 52 years old, had no telephone connection, had white skin with dark complexion, had blue eyes, black hair, was 1,75 meter long and weighed almost 76 kilo. Remarkable is that he was working for his sister, mentioned as ‘Mrs Anna Withagen’ in Sebeka. Both of them lived in Paddock. Also remarkable is that the person registering him was Jacques Hendrickx, who I wrote about before above. It is unknown if Leonard served in the army during WOII.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1950’s, Anna Withagen-Buijsen lived in Seymour, Outagamie, so back in Wisconsin. She inhabited a farm. I don’t know if her brother lived with her on that farm, but her unmarried children did, I suppose. Seymour is a town with about 3500 inhabitants, located at about ten kilometers from Black Creek and a bit less than 25 kilometers from Kaukauna. I’m glad to be able to mention Seymour in this article, because it is maybe the most American town in existence: the hamburger was invented here. There’s a hamburger festival, a hamburger statue and a hamburger museum. Very cool.\n\nAnna Maria returned to the Netherlands two times. The first time was in 1951, when she went alone. I could not find any travel documents surrounding that trip, but I did find a group photo that was made. In 1955, they went for a second time, travelling by plane. It must have been quite a journey where they probably saved money for years. She went with her brother Leonard, who flew on a plane for the first time of his life. After their trip, when coming back to the US, a list was made that looks similar to the lists made on Ellis Island. Brother and sister landed in New York on September 27, 1955. They carried 28 kilos of luggage and eleven kilo’s of hand luggage. They departed from Schiphol with a KLM plane, a Lockheed L-1049E flying under Dutch flag. The flight included two stopovers, one in Shannon in Ireland and one in Gander in Canada. Shannon was, as one of the most western airports of Europe, an important hub for trans-atlantic flights. In Gander in Newfoundland, a registration was made by the American Immigration Services. That way we know that the pilot was the British John H. Stanley and the co-pilot’s were Dutchmen Gerrit van den Born and J.L. (Jules) Hoeberechts. They hopped on a final flight called NW525 to MKE: Milwaukee in Wisconsin.\n\nAround 1955, Anna Maria became sick. She lived in Kaukauna for the last years of her life, on West Third Street 307. She died on wednesday october 23, 1957, at 23h45. She was laid out in the funeral home in Greenwood, Kaukauna, and was buried the next saturday morning after a mass by pastor Peter A. Salm in the catholic church of Saint Mary’s. In the US, a more detailed obituary is usual compared to the dutch ones, and such an obituary was written in the ‘Sebeka Review’, the local newspaper of Paddock, Minnesota. That means a lot of people in Minnesota still knew her well. [this citation was re-translated from english to dutch]\n\n“Ms. Anna Withagen from Kaukauna, Wisconsin, died on wednesday october 23, at quarter to twelve in the evening at that place, after a sickbed of two years. She was born in the Netherlands on november 2nd, 1887 and came to America in 1920. She lived in North Dakota and Minnesota before coming to Wisconsin. She went back to the Netherlands in 1925, 1951 and 1955, when she flew there with her brother Leonard Brysen. (..) The burial was on the local parish cemetary. She leaves behind her four daughters ms George McCarthy from Appleton, Wisconsin, ms Alfred Jeske, miss Anna Withagen and ms Ed Swiechowski, all from Kaukauna, a brother Leonard Brysen from Kaukauna and nine grandchildren. Her husband passed away before her on September 27, 1940. The family lived here in Paddock township for many years. She will be missed by a lot of friends in this community.”\n\nBrother Leonard worked at Appleton Mill around this time: the local paper factory and an important employer in the area. He retired in 1958. He lived in Kaukauna on West 13th Street 406. On September 18, 1972, he passed away in Kaukauna at the age of 82. Tree documents confirm that date: a death certificate with exact date and document number 030159, a certificate from the Social Services archives which had to do with is retirement, bearing his date of birth and last known ZIP-code (54130), and a burial certificate that mentions Saint Mary’s cemetery. Leonard remained unmarried and childless. In his obituary, it was written that he was surpassed by two nieces: miss Ann Withagen and ms. Freida Swiechowski, both in Kaukauna, and a nephew, Leonard Withagen. The funeral services were held in the local Saint Alois church, of which parish he was a member.\n\nDaughter Anna Withagen also remained unmarried. She lived in Kaukauna and was frequently photographed along with her family. I don’t know much more about her, to be honest. She passed away on July 24, 1993 in Kaukauna. That date is confirmed by a death certificate from the state of Wisconsin and the Social Services index, which mentioned the ZIP-code 54130. She was 72 years old. These certificates also make something clear about her name. It was Anna Alima, as noted on the immigration registers. In these certificates, Anna P. and Anna Pauline Withagen are mentioned. That would mean she was named after her grandmother Paulina Withagen-Schuurbiers, or maybe after my great-great grandmother, her aunt Paulina Maria Franken-Withagen. I hope I’ll find more information about this here.\n\nLorraine Withagen x McCarthy\n\nI wrote before about the marriage between oldest daughter Lorraine Marie Withagen and George Willem McCarthy in 1940. An article about the wedding was placed in the local newspaper. The family always stayed in Wisconsin. Some of their children were Robert G. McCarthy (1943-2004) and Gerald McCarthy. Gerald and his wife Jan sent me lots of family pictures. Lorraine would pass away at a young age, on October 28, 1960 in Appleton. She was 41 years old. Her husband George was born on September 21, 1915 in Appleton and would pass away there on June 21, 1984.\n\nGeorge was the second youngest son of his family. He had six older sisters, two older brothers and a younger brother. From two of them, I could find their place of birth: sister Loretta Anna McCarthy was born in 1900 in Grand Chute and George himself in Appleton in 1915. His parents were Michael John McCarthy and Theresa Stoffel. They married on July 18, 1898. The Little Chute Historical Society gives a detailed description of the family. Michael was born on October 3, 1865, in Center, Outagamie. He spent his childhood on his parent’s farm and had a basic education at the local school in Grand Chute. His education was basic because his help was needed doing farm work at home. He left his childhood home age 32, when he married Theresa. Just before the wedding, he bought a farm with 68 acres of land, of which 22 acres were forested land and the rest was used for agriculture. Michael was particularly known for his cattle breeding, with a speciality in breeding Holstein cows, the black and white we can well recognize in the Netherlands. Michael was an independent democrat in local politics and a member of the catholic parish in neighbouring Mackville. His farm must have been somewhere near Mackville or Center. He would pass away on October 8, 1942, in Center, the township he was born in. His wife passed away on May 25, 1956.\n\nTheresa was born on June 24, 1877 in Grand Chute, as a daughter of Joseph Stoffel and Anna Pfeifer. Her father was a brother of Michael’s mother Margaret Stoffel, so they were cousins. That seems remarkable but I recognize marrying ‘within the family’ as being usual as well in the Bergen op Zoom hovenier community. With a dispensation note of the pastor, it was alright most of the time. Joseph Stoffel was born in 1831 in Bavaria or Wassersuppen in Bohemia, which is close to the Bavarian border. He immigrated along with his parents to the US and bought a farm in Grand Chute, on which he lived until his death. His first marriage was four years later, on July 8, 1860 in the catholic Saint John Nepomucene church in Little Chute, which was coincidentally named after a Czech saint. He married Theresa Siegert, born on January 1, 1842 in Zieditz, Bohemia, the currently named Citice in Czechia. Theresa also came as an emigrant with her parents. She was a daughter of Johann Andreas Sigerth (*Falkenau, Sokolov, Czechia, 12/1-1806, ✞Greenville, Outagamie, Wisconsin, 19/1-1887) and Elisabeth A. Komma (*Zieditz, Bohemia, Czechia, ca. 1808, ✞Appleton, Outagamie, Wisconsin, 22/4-1890). Genealogical information can be relatively well found in Czechia, as can be seen from the fact that her family tree can be traced back to Johann David Sigerth, born around 1697 in Unterneugrün in Bohemia. The name Bohemia might be somewhat confusing. It seems these people were all Sudeten Germans: ethnic Germans living in a stroke of land in West Czechia, along the German border. The old Bohemia and the current Czechia can be used to address the same country alternately. Sudetenland is known as one of the earliest Nazi targets in the 1930’s, because of the many Germans living in ‘Slavic area’ at that time.\n\nTheresa Siegert would pass away at a young age, on September 7, 1874 in Grand Chute, Outagamie. She was surpassed by her six children. Almost two years later, Joseph Stoffel remarried Anna Pfeifer in Appleton, on June 6, 1876. In the marriage certificate it was stated that he was born in Bavaria, and Anna was born in Austria. The Pilsen area were the Stoffel family originally came from is located in around the same part of Europa as Bavaria and the north of Austria, so there might have been some connection. Little is known about Anna. She was born around 1855 as a daughter of Chas. Pfeiffer and Theressa Pfeiffer, with ‘Chas.’ pointing towards a standard abbreviation of Charles. I also suspect that Pfeiffer wasn’t her mother’s maiden name. A lot of Pfeiffer families lived in Appleton and Outafamie, but it is a very common German surname and with the many German people in the area, a connection can hardly be found. The Stoffel-Pfeifer couple had two daughters: Theresa, born in 1877 and Bertha Stoffel (*Appleton, Outagamie, Wisconsin, 7/11-1878, ✞9/2-1963). Bertha married on April 19, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois with a certain Michael J. Meyers or Myers. She went to the big city. Myers was of German heritage and owned a restaurant in the metropole. I don’t know when Anna Pfeifer passed away. Joseph Stoffel died on October 10, 1892 in Grand Chute. He would later be buried at the Saint Mary’s cemetery in Greenville, Outagamie. His tombstone beares a german text: ‘hier ruht’ and ‘alter .. jahre’.\n\nAs I wrote before, the Stoffel family emigrated from current Czechia. Michael (Mike) Stoffel was born or baptized on April 19, 1805 in Wassersuppen (or Nemanice in the Czech language). Wassersuppen is located in the Sudetenland, next to the border with the German state of Bavaria. A small farming town in the hills, amidst many pine tree forests. Mike married Margareth of Margaret Sieplen (also named Bauer) on August 27, 1832 in Wassersuppen. They had five children: Joseph, Margaret, Katrina, Anna and Wenzel. Daughter Margaret would later marry a McCarthy family member. The whole family was ready to emigrate. They probably travelled north first, to Bremen, and bought a ticket there for a big journey. On April 6, 1856, they arrived in New York, aboard the ‘Coriolan’. The Coriolan was a bark, a large sailing vessel that made trans-atlantic passages before the steam boat age. I found two different factsheets about what could be the ship. First source stated that it was built in 1847 in Lubeck using oak wood and weighed 499 tons. It was under the command of captain Steengrafe and would be in service of the Stanton & Ruger company. A second source states that it was built in Kennebunk in Maine (US) and would arrive in New York (coming from Bremen) the first time at the end of september. It would have been in service of the Bremish F. Reck & co. company. Coriolan passenger lists are available, with mainly a lot of Germans down in the hold. Halfway through the 19th century, just before the German unification under Bismarck, extremely large numbers of Germans emigrated to the US, which can be seen on this map. It is because of that that German-Americans are still today the largest ethnic group in the US.\n\nMike Stoffel ended up in Milwaukee at the shore of Lake Michigan. According to a 1911 book about Outagamie by Thomas Ryan, that was in 1854, but that would have been two years before his emigration to the US. It is possible they made a wrong assumption when writing that book. Around that year, everything west of Milwaukee was still wilderness, so he went to Madison on foot and walked from there on to Outagamie. He founded a farm in Grand Chute. All and all it was a 264 kilometer long trip. The couple lived at the Grand Chute farm for their whole lives. Mike passed away at the end of April or the 1st or 2nd of June, 1885 in Outagamie county, probably in Grand Chute. His wife died on September 16, 1891 in Grand Chute. She was buried two days later on September 18, 1891 in the Saint Mary’s cemetery in Greenville, were her late husband Mike was buried on May 2, 1885.\n\nBack to the McCarthy part of this substory. Michael John McCarthy was a son of Stephen Patrick McCarthy and Margaretha (Margaret) Stoffel, a daughter of the above mentioned Mike Stoffel. Margaretha was born on January 25, 1842 in Wassersuppen and was baptized there on January 28, 1842 in the local catholic church. She emigrated as a child with her parents, who went on living in Grand Chute. On November 2, 1862, she married Irishman Stephen Patrick McCarthy in Appleton or Greenville. The couple would eventually get ten children. One of those children was Timothy Thomas McCarthy (*Center, Outagamie, Wisconsin, 5/10-1866, ✞23/4-1946). Timothy was the third son of the couple. I mention him here because he was the father of a famous American, one that even I learned about in high school: senator Joseph Raymond McCarthy (*Grand Chute, Outagamie, Wisconsin, 14/11-1908, ✞Bethesda, Montgomery, Maryland, 2/5-1957). Democrat McCarthy is an example of the US’ situation at the start of the cold war, being a communist hunter. He was in charge of years of attacks on all sorts of Americans and organisations, he was accused of having communist sympathies, which would make them traitors. With his tactics, he came into conflict with president Eisenhower and laid the groundwork for a style which would be exemplary for the rest of the cold war. A style which was named after him: Mccarthyism.\n\nStephen Patrick McCarthy was born on December 24, 1825 in Kyleagoonagh in the county Tipperary in Ireland. He was baptized on December 27, 1825 in Borrisokane, where the closest parish church stood. His parents were mentioned as Michael Carty and Mary Gleeson, his godfather and mother were Tim Carty and Ann Gleeson. Kyleagoonagh was noted as the family’s residence. Stephen was one of the children that crossed the Atlantic, according to numerous sources as a young man in or around 1848. That year leads me to another historic thing I learned about in school; the potato disease or Irish Famine of the 1845-1849 period. Ireland at that time was nothing short of a poor and backwards colony of Great-Britain. It was different than the UK: catholic, agricultural, and so forth. It was so dependent on the potato harvest, with potatoes being the basis of almost all meals, that when there was a crop failure in 1845 caused by a potato disease, a couple of horrible years started for Ireland. In 1845 and 1846, the harvest failed because of this disease, that ended when there was a drought in 1847, which caused another failed harvest. Along with an outbreak of typhoid. In 1848, the potato disease broke out again because of a very wet period. In December that year, a cholera epidemic happened. London did nothing: the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism was at its peak and a unbalanced distribution of food was a part of that model. Nearing 1849, the base of life for many Irish was basically swept away. More than one million Irish had died because of hunger and disease. The population of the island shrank from eight million to around 3,5 million people. Millions of Irish fled the island. They went to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, but most of all: the US. Ships went back and forth, packed with Irish families and unmarried Irishmen that would never see their home country again. More about this time period can be viewed on this Youtube channel, I really recommend it.\n\nIt is very much possible that Stephen was one of those immigrants. He emigrated in 1848, and probably didn’t go alone. McCarthy ended up on a farm in upstate New York, where he went on working as a laborer. It was very hard work. After seven years, in 1855, he saved enough money to buy his own homestead with some land. This homestead was located in Outagamie county, in Grand Chute or Center, and he bought it from the brother of the farmer he worked for. He never saw the place until after he bought it, he hadn’t even been to Wisconsin before. Stephen saved some more money, until he had enough to buy two oxen, a wagon and some other necessities. After this story, I’ve read two sources, both telling a different story. The first source says that he sent some money to his mother at the end of his ten year stay in New York and then went with his ox wagon to Wisconsin. Once there, he met two Indians on his land, sitting in an old wood shack. The other sources state that he went from New York to Chicago by train, and from there on with a stagecoach to Milwaukee. He walked from Milwaukee to his homestead in Outagamie. Upon his arrival, he was met by two Indians, living on his land. He built a wood shack where he slept in, cleared the terrain and built his little farm with help of the indians.\n\nStephen married Margaret Stoffel in Greenville on November 2, 1862. I presume the wedding took place in Greenville because the nearest catholic church was located there. In the 1911 book about Outagamie, the writers mentioned something about a farm of son William Patrick McCarthy, and that he was born in 1875 on his parents’ farm in Center. If the previous sources are right, Stephen McCarthy lived on the farm he built himself for is whole life. The source stated about him: [this citation was re-translated into english from dutch]\n\n“William P. McCarthy, whose excellent 73 acres farm is located in the Center township, is one of the more well-known farmers in his section, and a son of pioneer parents. He was born in December 19, 1875 on his father’s farm in Center. (..) As soon as he was ready, he let his mother come over from their old motherland, and she went to live with them, on the land that is now owned by William P. McCarthy.”\n\nThis means that I can maybe retrace the location of the farm built by Stephen, also using the US Census registrations of him and his son. In the 1870 census, Stephen is mentioned as inhabitant of the ‘town of Center’. He lived there with his family, had 4000 dollars worth of property and 575 in cash. Next to him lived his younger brother Tim McCarthy with his young family and the family of Scottish immigrant Alex Beggs, along with his wife and 24 year old twins William and Agnes. He also lived there in 1900, one year before he died. Other neighbours were three Jense families, all of them of German heritage, and the German Wenzel Schrieter family. For the 1910 census, we’ll have to start with looking up son William. On a row are mentioned: John McCarthy, 26, Louisia McCarthy, 24, baby Lucile McCarthy, servant Fred Hartmann, 22, William McCarthy, 35, Mollie McCarthy, 33, widow Margaret McCarthy, 67 (Margaretha Stoffel) and Ferdinand Jacobs, 22, servant. In the 1910 census, a street name was stated for the first time: McCarthy’s Road. That doesn’t seem a coincidence. In between Grand Chute and a crossroad near Center lies a road, almost 7,5 kilometers long. To be sure this is the right road, I looked up the previous street listed in the register, which was ‘Hampils Road’. A quick Google search shows that at the end of McCarthy road, there’s a small forest, next to Bear Creek. Next to those woods lies Hampel Road, which is probably the same street.\n\nThe book ‘Land of the Fox, Saga of Outagamie county’ gives a description of the Center as a town were German en Irish immigrants came together, a thing which can also be seen looking at the McCarthy-Stoffel couple. [this citation was re-translated into english from dutch]\n\n“Center was named after the eponymous town in Columbiana county, Ohio, where many of the early Irish settlers had a momentary stay before travelling to Outagamie. This groip, also known as the ‘Irish buckeyes’, dominated the local government for many years. This was partly because of them being the first settlers but also because they had an big interest in the welfare and growth of the town. (..) Nearing 1857, the eastern part of the town was inhabited by Irish, while the center en norther parts were quickly filled with Germans. These people worked hard building their roads, schools and churches. Well maintained farms, big barns and strong fences could be seen everywhere as soon as the land was cleared for farming.”\n\nStephen McCarthy passed away on August 11, 1901, probably on his own farm. His widow Margaret McCarthy-Stoffel died years later at her son’s house on July 1, 1919, in Appelton or Mackville. Both of them were buried in the catholic cemetery in Greenville.\n\nSo, Stephen was from Kyleagoonagh. The township is located about twenty kilometers north of Nenagh, in the center of Ireland. His father Michael McCarthy must have been born around 1800; he passed away in Ireland around 1840. His mother Mary Gleason was born around 1808. Stephen’s family followed his footsteps and came over to the United States. Mary emigrated in 1860, along with her brother Timothy (Tim) McCarthy (*Killaloe, county Clare, 10/10-1835, ✞US, 1/5-1911). Tim would later marry Mary Ringrose (*Ireland, february 1845, ✞Aberdeen, Brown county, South Dakota, 28/10-1911). The Ringrose family is quite interesting, because a certain path of immigrants throughout the US can be seen in their story. Maurice Ringrose (*Bally Corney, county Clare, Ireland, ca. 1820, ✞Aberdeen, Brown county, South Dakota, 21/12-1904) and Anne Cox (*county Clare, Ireland, 16/4-1821, ✞Aberdeen, Brown county, South Dakota, 21/12-1904). The Ringrose couple came to the US in 1849 (which probably is not a coincidence) and went on to live in Appleton. Two of their sons went further west in 1880, in search of pioneer land. The couple would follow their sons in 1882. When we take a look at the birthplaces of their children, it can be seen that the oldest two were born in Ireland, their third child daughter Katherine Elizabeth Ringrose in Berlin, Hartford, Connecticut and the five youngest children in Appleton or Greenville, Outagamie.\n\nA few things about other brothers and sisters of Stephen. One of them was Michael McCarthy (*county Tipperary, Ireland, 20/9-1830, ✞Chicago, Illinois, 1866, buried in Saint Mary’s cemetery in Appleton), Mary Katherine McCarthy (*county Tipperary, Ireland, ca. 1834, ✞Chicago, Illinois, 27/7-1874), she married immigrant Daniel Fleming (*Ierland, 1824, ✞Chicago, Illinois, 24/6-1875) and finally brother Patrick McCarthy (*county Tipperary, Ireland, 17/3-1834,✞1919, buried in Saint Mary’s cemetery in Appleton). Patrick McCarthy came 3,5 years after his mother to the US, so in 1864. When the biographies in the 1911 book about Outagamie were written, he must have been the only one of the children still alive. Patrick worked after arriving in the States on a farm in Rochester, New York first. And that could very well be the same farm Stephen worked on fifteen years earlier. After his time in New York, Patrick bought a farm in Center, Outagamie with his brother Tim, but sold his stocks in the farm to Tim around the time of his marriage. He founded his own farm in Grand Chute. [this citation was re-translated into english from dutch]\n\n“In the long time he has lived here, he became well-known as a progressive and practical farmer, a citizen with a sense of community and a friendly neighbour. He is a devoted member of the Saint Mary’s parish in Appleton, and is a political independent.”\n\nPatrick married Margaret Maloney (*county Kerry, Ireland, 18/6-1842, ✞3/5-1911, buried in Saint Mary’s cemetery in Appleton). Margaret emigrated to the US around the same time Patrick did, and lived a while with her mother at her nieces’ house in New York City. Later, she lived at a brother’s house, who was a blacksmith. She then went on travelling to Chicago, where Patrick visited her to propose to her. They started a farm just outside the border between Center and Grand Chute.\n\nMary L. Withagen x Jeske\n\nDaughter Mary Leonardius (Marie) Withagen would marry not much later than her oldest sister, with Alfred Jeske on April 30, 1942 in Pacific county in the state of Washington. Witnesses were Ernest R. Markham and Mary Ann Markham, with the marriage official being E.F. Wood, an Ilwaco resident. Bride and groom both lived in Pacific county. Alfred was born on August 25, 1918 in Outagamie, Wisconsin. Ilwaco is a town at the bank of the Columbia river. Alfred was in service at that time, and was later mentioned somewhere as a WOII-veteran. The attack on Pearl Harbor happened in December 1941, which got the US involved in the war. The epicentre of the war were at that time the battles in the pacific, which could maybe explain why the couple lived on the west coast at the time of their marriage. The Jeske-Withagen couple had four children: Walter Gerard Jeske (*18/1-1948, ✞17/8-2002, buried in Kaukauna, Outagamie), Allen John Jeske (*Green Bay, Brown, Wisconsin, 26/7-1949, ✞1/8-1949), Keith Jeske and Freida Haas-Jeske. Unfortunately Mary Withagen also passed away at a young age, on January 5, 1959 at age 39. She was buried in Saint Mary’s cemetery in Kaukauna. Alfred remarried Loretta Lucy Redell (*Spring Hill, Illinois, 3/5-1923, ✞West DePere, Brown county, Wisconsin, 25/1-2015) on December 8, 1973 in Kaukauna. Loretta was a widow of James C. Blean. Alfred worked at the Thilmany paper factory in Kaukauna for years, and later at the North Shore golf course. Both of them would reach a very old age: Alfred passed away on November 2, 2017 in DePere, close to Green Bay. Funeral services were held in the Methodist church in Kaukauna, followe"
