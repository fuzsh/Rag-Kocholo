        "text": "What a brilliant conference last week at Port Douglas. It was incredibly inciteful to take in and takeaway so much from the speakers like Nadine Champion, Dean Mannix - Speaker - Sales Growth and Mindset, Scott Rumble, and Carolyn Miller. Entertained by \"Lehmo\" over dinner and Michael Pope over the 2 days as MC . During to the 2 days, I was fortunate to mingle with other brokers, and lender BDM's over the 2 days, sharing ideas and thoughts on the industry. It's great to get back to work feeling energised and put a lot of what we learnt into practice and develop our business further to helping our new and existing clients. So, what were my 5 \"take aways\" from the 2023 Connective Asset Finance conference?; 1. Don't mess with Rita Sauvage! ü§£ (karate chopped a block of wood on stage on Day 1) 2. Courage. Finding the courage within yourself to make change for good can be difficult, but once you find it, you won't regret the decision. 3. If you're new to the industry, there is a lot of help available out there that you can bounce ideas off. (As a 57 year old rookie, I can attest to this!) 4. Change your mindset. Challenge your thinking about the direction of your business is relevant and great way to review and freshen ideas. We need to step out of our comfort zone and do this more often! 5. Be better at building strong relationships - whether it's with your clients, your work colleagues, BDM's, or even your friends & family. It's up to you on the effort you make into the relationships that you build. Sell yourself before you start selling anything else! Just want to also give big shoutout and Well done to the events team at Connective in putting this Asset Finance Conference together!! üëè üëè #kellyandcofinance #brokersarebetter #brokerlife"
