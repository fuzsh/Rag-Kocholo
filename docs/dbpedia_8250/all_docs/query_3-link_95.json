        "text": "Some 63% of the world’s music, by value, is consumed outside the United States, according to IFPI.\n\nBillboard’s International Power Players recognizes industry leaders — nominated by their companies and peers and selected by our editors — with primary responsibility outside the United States. Honorees include label executives, music publishers, independent entrepreneurs, artist managers and concert promoters.\n\nThe late Michael Gudinski of Australia, who died March 2 at the age of 68, achieved success in all of those roles and more. A music industry pioneer whose Mushroom Group would become a template for independent companies, Gudinski, with his exuberant personality, became the face of his country’s music scene.\n\nIn recognition of his incomparable five-decade music career, Billboard posthumously honors Gudinski as our International Power Players Executive of the Year.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“The touring side is decimated. It’s frustrating. I really can’t see [international tours] happening before the end of the year,” Gudinski told Billboard over the phone during an interview on Feb. 11. “But it’s a great time for Australian acts to shine.”\n\nGudinski loved music, his birthplace of Melbourne and his homeland. He loved family more than anything — a brood that, to him, included the more than 250 employees across Mushroom Group, the independent music powerhouse he built from scratch.\n\nIn that final interview, Gudinski talked about the many things he cherished: Bruce Springsteen and Foo Fighters, great songs, cricket and good food. (He shed 17 pounds during the pandemic, which he attributed to eating grilled fish and removing French fries from his diet.) And, of course, he mentioned his immediate family: his wife, Sue, and his grown children, Kate and Matt.\n\nGudinski died in his sleep on March 2. His impact on Australia’s music industry is immeasurable, highlighted by the state memorial held March 24 in his honor at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena.\n\nThe careers of countless artists and music industry figures moved forward thanks to the 24-strong companies that form Mushroom Group. Gudinski established the company in 1973 and led as chairman until his death.\n\nToday, the group includes Mushroom Music Publishing, the country’s leading independent publisher; The Harbour Agency; labels I Oh You, Liberation and Bloodlines; and the concert promotion juggernaut Frontier Touring, which ranked as the third-largest promoter in the world in 2018, according to Billboard Boxscore, with gross ticket sales of $245.1 million and over 2.7 million tickets sold to 440 reported shows.\n\nDuring the tribute in Melbourne, held in the city’s largest indoor arena, those closest to Gudinski appeared onstage or in the audience, including Kylie Minogue, Jimmy Barnes and Ed Sheeran, who made the long haul from the United Kingdom to pay tribute to “this titan of a man.” Sheeran performed a new song in celebration of Gudinski, “Visiting Hours,” which he wrote during his stay in quarantine, a hurdle for every visitor entering Australia.\n\nThose who couldn’t make the trip to Melbourne opened their hearts in other ways. On March 3, Springsteen unveiled his video for “I’ll See You in My Dreams” with a dedication to Gudinski and earlier stated he had “never met a better promoter.” Rock stars from Dave Grohl and Elton John to Billy Joel, Sting and many others remembered his infectious, larger-than-life spirit in video tributes.\n\nArchie Roach, the iconic Indigenous artist who was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame in 2020, recounted Gudinski’s tireless championing of First Nations artists, including Troy Cassar-Daley, Christine Anu and Dan Sultan, and for his support of Yothu Yindi and its breakthrough hit, “Treaty.”\n\n“He gave us a chance,” said Roach. “If it wasn’t for Michael Gudinski, I wouldn’t have been working or been a recording artist.”\n\nGudinski always found a way. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, he recalibrated his company and focused on a string of new projects, which included the launch of a new label, Reclusive Records, with Yorta Yorta singer-songwriter Scott Darlow as its first signing.\n\nWith touring grounded, Gudinski’s considerable live-entertainment assets were mothballed. He threw himself into content production through his company’s Mushroom Vision division. He spearheaded the April 25 Anzac Day special Music From the Home Front, which was a ratings hit (capturing 1.4 million TV viewers, according to OzTAM data), as well as a spinoff multidisc fundraising album that reached No. 1 on the ARIA albums chart.\n\nHe then orchestrated a six-part virtual concert series, State of Music, through an alliance with Victoria Together, the online platform of the Victoria state government. A third project was realized when season one of The Sound premiered in July on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. A second season wrapped in December, while Music From the Home Front is confirmed to return on April 24, this time with a live, all-star concert at Melbourne’s Sidney Myer Music Bowl.\n\nGudinski shaped the landscape of Australian music, and he also introduced the world’s biggest acts to Australian audiences through Frontier Touring. Prior to the pandemic, the company had enjoyed a strong run that included stadium tours for Paul McCartney, Justin Bieber, Foo Fighters and Taylor Swift.\n\nWhen asked to describe himself for a Billboard feature published in 2010, Gudinski said, “I’m a man of my word. I’m persistent, and I’m loyal.”\n\nThose qualities paid off when Frontier Touring produced Sheeran’s ÷ (Divide) tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2018 that sold over 1.1 million tickets, shattering the all-time record for a single tour that had stood since Dire Straits set the mark in 1986.\n\nGudinski’s son, Matt, will now lead Mushroom Group as CEO. During his speech at the state memorial, the younger Gudinski hinted at big things to come. Mushroom Group, he said, is in its “strongest position ever,” and with its 50th year approaching, “I know that our incredibly talented Mushroom family will help me deliver the vision Dad and I had for the next 50 years of our business.”\n\nDominique Casimir\n\nExecutive vp global repertoire and marketing, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, BMG\n\nJustus Haerder\n\nExecutive vp group strategy and M&A, BMG\n\nSebastian Hentzschel\n\nChief information officer, BMG\n\nCasimir’s role — signing, promoting and working with artists and songwriters across continental Europe — expanded to Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region in November. She also helped lead BMG’s new partnership with independent German live-music promoter Undercover as “the logical extension of BMG’s plan to integrate all the services an artist could need under one roof.” Responsibility for BMG’s global technology infrastructure falls under Hentzschel, who saw the company’s workforce dispersed last year to over 900 locations. The instant-messaging app myBMG allowed artists and songwriters to track royalty payouts and also collaborate during the lockdown. Under Haerder, BMG continued its run of music-rights deals in 2020, including the Undercover partnership, the COVID-19-fighting charity single “cOMbat quotidien” released with the French football club Olympique de Marseille and a deal for the recording catalog royalties of Mick Fleetwood. This spring, BMG’s film and TV business, under Haerder, plans a multimedia release of Fleetwood’s tribute to Peter Green, the guitarist who originally co-founded Fleetwood Mac.\n\nAdam Granite\n\nExecutive vp market development, Universal Music Group\n\nDickon Stainer\n\nPresident/CEO, global classics and jazz and Verve Label Group, Universal Music Group\n\nFor the world’s largest music company, Granite guides strategy for some of the globe’s fastest-growing markets. He has overseen UMG’s expansion within China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and the launches of Universal Music Nigeria, headquarters for Universal Music Southeast Asia in Singapore and new operations in Israel, Morocco and Vietnam. UMG has launched labels including Def Jam Africa & South East Asia, Astralwerks Asia and Island Records Philippines. Stainer guides the strategic direction of UMG’s market-leading classical and jazz labels including Decca, Deutsche Grammophon, Mercury KX, the distributed label ECM and Capitol Music Group’s Blue Note, as well as Verve Label Group, including Verve, Impulse! and Decca U.S. In the past year, Stainer has overseen major campaigns for artists including Lang Lang, Melody Gardot, Ludovico Einaudi, John Williams, Gregory Porter, Max Richter and Andrea Bocelli — whose performance from the Duomo Cathedral in Milan on Easter Sunday 2020 reached over 2.8 million peak concurrent viewers worldwide, according to UMG.\n\nWouter Jansen\n\nVP streaming and digital marketing strategy, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nMonica Cornia\n\nSenior vp international marketing, RCA Records and Arista Records, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nMelissa Thomas\n\nSenior vp international marketing, Columbia Records and Epic Records, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nJansen oversees streaming and digital marketing strategy for Sony Music’s U.S. labels across more than 50 markets. With his colleagues, he helped Columbia Records achieve four concurrent top 10 hits on the Spotify Global chart with Harry Styles’ “Watermelon Sugar,” Jawsh 685’s “Savage Love (Laxed — Siren Beat),” Powfu’s “death bed” and StaySolidRocky’s “Party Girl.” As co-heads of Sony’s international marketing group, Cornia and Thomas are responsible for global campaigns for artists from RCA and Arista (Cornia), and Columbia and Epic (Thomas). For Doja Cat, Cornia helped drive her single “Say So” to chart peaks in multiple markets and 2.52 billion global on-demand streams, according to MRC Data. She also guided Sony Nashville on Kane Brown’s debut tour in Europe. Thomas has helped lead campaigns for Camila Cabello, DJ Khaled, French Montana, Travis Scott and others while also leading Sony Music’s international urban team.\n\nDonny Novakovic\n\nVP international marketing, Disney Music Group\n\nThe soundtracks for some of the biggest movie franchises in the world — from Disney, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm and Pixar — are marketed outside the United States with campaigns overseen by Novakovic. The soundtrack for Frozen II has been released in 26 languages, resulting in 4.6 billion streams and 3 million albums sold outside the United States, according to Disney. Novakovic guided the launch of Disney Spotify hubs in Germany, Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Middle East and North Africa, adding to the existing hubs in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSimon Robson\n\nPresident, international, Warner Recorded Music, Warner Music Group\n\nEric Wong\n\nPresident/chief marketing officer, Warner Recorded Music, Warner Music Group\n\nJess Keeley-Carter\n\nSenior vp global marketing, Warner Recorded Music, Warner Music Group\n\nSince November, Robson has led WMG’s recorded-music operations outside the United States and United Kingdom. He has been president of Warner Music Asia since 2015 and expanded WMG’s presence in markets including China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam. WMG has a new joint-label venture in China with Tencent Music Group. It has also invested in Africori, the largest music distributor in sub-Saharan Africa, and Rotana Music, the Arab world’s leading independent label. Wong, who joined WMG in July 2020, guides worldwide marketing while also overseeing Warner’s international A&R function in collaboration with the company’s local repertoire centers around the globe. Keeley-Carter, who reports to Wong, played a key role in one of the company’s biggest campaigns of 2020, for Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia. Setting up marketing best practices for Warner worldwide, she has also guided campaigns for artists including Bebe Rexha, Burna Boy, Cardi B, David Guetta, Jason Derulo, Lizzo, Roddy Rich and Sia.\n\nFred Gillham\n\nManaging director, Concord Recorded Music U.K.\n\nVivien Goodwin\n\nSenior vp, Concord Theatricals (U.K. and Europe)\n\nDuring the past year, Gillham set up Concord’s first recorded-music division outside the United States, recruiting a London-based team to build a footprint for the company in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Concord enjoyed U.K. success across genres. Gillham is no stranger to Concord’s roster. He is a former vp of international for Universal Music Group, which has a global distribution deal with Concord. During the pandemic, Goodwin and her teams in the United Kingdom and Germany worked with theaters and theater companies to think creatively in staging outdoor performances and creating musicals with smaller casts, supporting streaming initiatives and, overall, to offer audiences new ways to engage with performers and productions.\n\nTony Harlow\n\nCEO, Warner Music U.K.\n\nBernd Dopp\n\nChairman/CEO, Warner Music Central Europe\n\nMark Fry\n\nPresident, Warner Music Nordics\n\nAlfonso Perez Soto\n\nPresident of emerging markets, Warner Music\n\nVictor Aroldoss\n\nSenior vp international marketing, Warner Music U.K.\n\nHarlow, along with Aroldoss and the Warner Music U.K. team, guided the launch during lockdown of Future Nostalgia from Britain’s Dua Lipa. The album spent four weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, where Warner’s team also celebrated chart-topping releases from Biffy Clyro, Liam Gallagher, Nines and Stormzy. Leading Central Europe, Dopp is a five-decade veteran of WMG and the company’s longest-serving CEO. He has continued to deliver hits with international artists and domestic talent, the latter ranging from German rap to the repertoire of children’s label Kiddinx to the leading schlager label Telamo. Fry was named head of Warner Music Nordics last year and has enjoyed success with stars including Antti Tuisku, Emma Gaala and Miriam Bryant. Perez Soto has been expanding WMG’s presence in new markets including Africa, where the company invested in Africori, a company that manages distribution, rights and artists development. That deal gives Warner access to a range of African artists through Africori’s roster of 6,500 artists and 700 labels.\n\nJason Iley\n\nChairman/CEO, Sony Music U.K. and Ireland\n\nNicola Tuer\n\nCOO, Sony Music U.K. and Ireland\n\nDaniel Lieberberg\n\nPresident, Sony Music Entertainment Continental Europe and Africa\n\nPatrick Mushatsi-Kareba\n\nCEO, Sony Music Entertainment Germany, Switzerland, Austria\n\nSean Watson\n\nManaging director, Sony Music Entertainment South Africa\n\nIley, who was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire at the Queen’s Birthday Honours in October 2020 for his services to charity and music, has worked with Tuer and the Sony U.K. team to achieve success for Sony’s international stars (from Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to Doja Cat, Powfu and Tate McRae) and its strong domestic roster (Little Mix, J Hus, Headie One, Sam Fischer and Regard). Under Lieberberg, Sony opened a new German and European headquarters in Berlin housing recording and publishing teams along with an in-house studio. Responsible for Germany, Switzerland and Austria, Mushatsi-Kareba saw an increase in chart shares via hits from artists like Jawsh 685, Imanbek and Apache 207, the most streamed German-speaking artist in the region, according to Sony. Watson, a 30-year veteran of the African music industry, guides a roster that includes AKA, Shekinah, Mlindo, Sha Sha, Black Motion, KDDO and Dice Ailes. He’s a member of the board of the South African Music Performance Rights Association and its nonprofit division supporting the growth of the South African music industry.\n\nDavid Joseph\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music U.K. and Ireland\n\nFrank Briegmann\n\nChairman/president, Universal Music Central Europe and Deutsche Grammophon\n\nOlivier Nusse\n\nCEO, Universal Music France\n\nSipho Dlamini\n\nCEO, Universal Music South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nFranck Kacou\n\nManaging director, Universal Music Africa\n\nChindedu Okeke\n\nManaging director, Universal Music Nigeria\n\nUnder Joseph, Universal Music U.K. claimed the No. 1 album of 2020 in the United Kingdom with Lewis Capaldi’s Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent and boasted four of the market’s top five streaming artists (Capaldi, Drake, Eminem and Billie Eilish), while the company launched the 0207 Def Jam label and relaunched EMI Records (with Motown U.K. as one of its imprints). Briegmann saw Universal lead the market in Germany on the strength of both international repertoire and local stars including Capital Bra, Bonez MC, Die Ärzte and Kerstin Ott. Universal Music France, under Nusse, likewise celebrated chart success with Versus by Vitaa/Slimane and Les Derniers Salopards by Maes, the country’s two top albums of 2020. Nusse’s team also shared in the achievements of local artists Angèle, Niska, Nekfeu, Damso and Dadju — and posthumous success for French legend Johnny Hallyday. In 2019, Kacou took on responsibility for UMG operations in Ivory Coast and across 27 French-speaking markets within Africa. Dlamini was promoted last December to oversee all of UMG’s operations within English-speaking Africa, working with colleagues on the continent including Okeke, based in Lagos, who is leading the growth of UMG’s Nigeria operations and other English-speaking markets in West Africa.\n\nJesús López\n\nChairman/CEO, Universal Music Latin America and Iberian Peninsula\n\nLuis Estrada\n\nPresident, Universal Music Southern Cone\n\nVictor Gonzalez\n\nPresident, Universal Music Latin Entertainment\n\nPaulo Lima\n\nPresident, Universal Music Brazil\n\nAfter J Balvin released his latest album, Colores, in March 2020, it debuted at No. 1 in 14 markets on Apple Music/iTunes rankings and earned gold certifications in its first week in 15 countries, according to Universal Music Group. The achievement is just one of the success stories of the past year for the team that reports to Lopez, who leads UMG’s operations in all Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking territories around the world, as well as the U.S. Latin market. To launch new songs by Balvin, Luis Fonsi, Chino & Nacho and others during the lockdown, UMG held virtual press conferences with journalists from all over Latin America, organized streaming concerts and struck brand sponsorship deals, while also supporting charitable initiatives by the artists themselves. A 40-year veteran of the Latin music industry, López has been an innovator, from anticipating the reggaetón boom with the creation of the Machete Music label to launching the management and artist services division GTS (Global Talent Services). He has played an essential role in the international success of Latin superstars including Balvin, Juanes, Paulina Rubio, Gloria Trevi, Enrique Iglesias, David Bisbal, Luis Fonsi and Wisin & Yandel.\n\nAfo Verde\n\nChairman/CEO, Latin-Iberia region, Sony Music Entertainment\n\nMaria Fernandez\n\nExecutive vp/COO, Sony Music Entertainment Latin-Iberia\n\nJosé María Barbat\n\nPresident, Sony Music Iberia\n\nStars like Maluma, Ozuna, Anuel, Nicky Jam, Camilo and Rauw Alejandro have thrived internationally under the leadership of Verde, who oversees Sony’s operations in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the U.S. Latin market, and whose purview includes superstars like Enrique Iglesias, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez’s Spanish-language releases. Verde also worked closely on Sony’s recent acquisition of leading Brazilian indie label Som Livre, a deal that further cements Sony’s leadership in the biggest market in Latin America. He and his team have nurtured the rise of Nathy Peluso, Boza, Nicki Nicole and Trueno, and he has made the expansion of Latin music in European and Asian markets a priority. Fernandez has been involved with the growth of artists including Maluma, Camilo, Carlos Vives, Lali, Dvicio, Carlos Rivera and Reik. She has also overseen strategic moves like Sony’s joint venture with the concert promotion company Eventim in Brazil. Under Barbat, Sony Music Iberia has seen the breakout of Rosalía, C.

(The move came in the wake of India’s ban of TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps over data privacy concerns.)

During the touring shutdown, he has focused on diversifying income streams for his clients.\n\nSteve Strange\n\nDirector/agent, X-ray Touring\n\nBeckie Sugden\n\nSenior agent, X-ray Touring\n\nColdplay, Eminem, Snow Patrol, Queens of the Stone Age and Jimmy Eat World are among the clients booked by Strange at London-based X-ray Touring, all awaiting the full-scale return of tours. Sugden helped bring Anderson .Paak and Russ abroad; represents Jhené Aiko, Gucci Mane and Ghostemane; and is one of the first agents to book many shows in emerging markets in the Middle East, according to the agency.\n\nNeil Warnock\n\nObi Asika\n\nCo-heads of U.K. office, UTA\n\nJules De Lattre\n\nAgent, music, UTA\n\nSean Hill\n\nDirector of tour marketing, music, UTA\n\nCleo Thompson\n\nExecutive, music brand partnerships, UTA\n\nUTA in March announced the acquisition of Echo Location Talent Agency, founded by Asika, who personally represents Alesso, Marshmello, Chase & Status and Trippie Redd, among others, while UTA will also book former Echo clients Diplo and Major Lazer. Warnock, a five-decade veteran in live booking, played a key role in guiding UTA clients and supporting U.K. music venues during the pandemic. De Lattre and his colleagues booked hundreds of virtual shows viewed by fans worldwide while generating “substantial revenue,” according to UTA. Hill developed artist marketing strategies for over 30 virtual concerts, including a 360-degree livestream from London in November for Burna Boy. Thompson guides UTA’s European brand-partnerships business and has helped the team close over 300 deals globally since the pandemic began.\n\nContributors: International Power Players was written by Thom Duffy with reporting from Katie Bain, Alexei Barrioneuvo, Lars Brandle, Dave Brooks, Patrick Brzeski, Keith Caulfield, Ed Christman, Tatiana Cirisano, Leila Cobo, Frank DiGiacomo, Chris Eggertsen, Griselda Flores, Tim Ingham, Glenn Peoples, Dan Rys, Marc Schneider and Rebecca Sun.\n\nMethodology: Nominations for Billboard power lists open not less than 120 days in advance of publication. (For a contact for our editorial calendar listing publication dates, please email thom.duffy@billboard.com.) The online nomination link is sent to press representatives and/or honorees of companies previously featured on any Billboard power list, as well as those who send a request to thom.duffy@billboard.com. Nominations close and lists are locked not less than 90 days before publication. Billboard’s 2021 International Power Players were chosen by editors based on factors including, but not limited to, nominations by peers, colleagues and superiors, limited to the industry sectors shown. Consideration was given to geographic diversity and the industry impact of honorees and/or their companies. That impact is measured by metrics including, but not limited to, chart, sales and streaming performance as measured by MRC Data and social media impressions using data available as of March 15.\n\nWhere Royalties Flow\n\nArtists worldwide create music to delight and inspire their fans. But they also need to get paid, whether through performance royalties (for songwriters and music publishers), mechanical royalties (for owners of sound-recording copyrights), digital performance royalties (paid in the United States by noninteractive digital streaming services) or neighboring rights royalties (earned outside the United States from the public performance of a master recording). Who can keep track? In the world’s top 10 markets as ranked by IFPI, these are the leading rights-collection organizations. Most are commonly identified by the widely used acronyms for their full names.\n\nThe Latin Boom\n\nWhen IFPI released its 2021 Global Music Report in March, it confirmed that only one region in the world experienced a double-digital rate of revenue growth in the preceding year — Latin America, where revenue increased by 15.9%.\n\nThat growth boosted the region’s share of the global recorded-music market to 3.6%, up from 3.3% in 2019. (Music consumption in the region outpaces that market share. Were it not for currency devaluation, the region would account for a higher share of global revenue.)\n\nStreaming revenue grew by 30.2% and accounted for 84.1% of Latin America’s total revenue. The growth is driven by the strength of the region’s artists, including multiple performers who are global superstars.\n\nFor a snapshot of that talent, Billboard highlights some of the most influential talents in Spain, which, bound by language with Latin America, as both a source and a destination for music in Spanish; Portuguese-speaking Brazil, which is the largest Latin American territory (by music revenue); and the Latin markets of Mexico, Argentina and Colombia."
