        "text": "Eugeen Van Mieghem was born at his parents’ tavern cum café on the Van Meterenkaai on October 1st 1875. His father Henri was a shipping agent while his mother Virginie ran the tavern known as In Het Hert.\n\nEugeen grew up on the banks of the River Scheldt, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the port. He also observed the colourful characters who frequented the café: skippers, sailors, owners of stevedoring companies (‘natiebazen’), porters of bagged goods (‘buildragers’) and female sack sewers.\n\nThe port and ordinary people were to become a major source of inspiration for the artist who bequeathed us an impressive, unique and masterfully executed picture of humankind in a cosmopolitan seaport around 1900. Van Mieghem was aptly dubbed the “artist of the people”.\n\nIn 1873 the Red Star Line started transporting emigrants from Antwerp to the New World (first America but after the First World War also Canada). The ships tied up near the Rijnkaai. The Red Star Line’s first office was on the Jordaenskaai.\n\nThe port of Antwerp had to be extended to accommodate the increasing activity and larger ships. The stone quay walls were built and the old inlets filled in. Around 1883 the works reached the Van Meterenkaai and Van Mieghem senior built a new tavern on Montevideostraat.\n\nThe Van Mieghem family’s café (No. 6 Montevideostraat with telephone number 21) was located on the ‘Eilandje’, a port district surrounded by the Scheldt and the docks. The street was the border between the port and residential Antwerp.\n\nEugeen went to school on Keistraat and his talent for drawing soon became apparent.\n\nHis teachers at the Koninklijk Atheneum in Antwerp included the writer and poet Pol de Mont. In 1891 Van Mieghem attended evening classes at Antwerp academy. In 1892 he became a full-time student there.\n\nIn November 1885 Vincent van Gogh enrolled at Antwerp academy but in February 1886 he was dismissed after a conflict with Professor Siberdt.\n\nIn 1891 the Antwerp art society L’Association pour l’Art was founded by Henry Van de Velde and Max Elskamp. Their trailblazing first exhibition in May-June 1892 included work by foreign artists like Bonnard, Pissarro, Seurat, Signac, de Toulouse-Lautrec, Toorop and Van Gogh.\n\nEugeen Van Mieghem saw this exhibition because it was held in the Old Museum in Venusstraat (back of Antwerp academy). In May 1893 L’Association pour l’Art mounted a second and last exhibition.\n\nVan Mieghem came top of his class at the academy. For the academic year 1893-94 he enrolled in the Drawing after ancient sculpture class. Between 1894-95 and 1895-96 he studied Drawing, figures from life under Professor Siberdt.\n\nIn 1893 the Red Star Line built a warehouse right opposite Eugeen’s mother’s café on the corner of the Rijnkaai and Montevideostraat. Here every migrant had to undergo a first brief medical check and their clothes and luggage were disinfected.\n\nFrom then on the artist encountered the mainly Jewish emigrants on a daily basis. Later on he portrayed them authentically and sympathically in sublime drawings, pastels and a few very rare paintings which are now shown all over the world.\n\nVan Mieghem’s earliest little paintings, including a self-portrait, date from 1894.\n\nJune of that year saw the opening of a second exhibition by the De Scalden group in the Zaal De Keyser. Influenced by the ideals of the English Arts and Crafts movement, the group attached great importance to traditional craftsmanship and quality materials and design.\n\nThis was probably Van Mieghem’s first group exhibition. He showed several drawings alongside work by friends like Karel Collens and Edmond Van Offel. Pol de Mont referred to his drawings in the magazine De Vlaamse School. De Scalden’s second yearbook contained illustrations of Van Mieghem’s work.\n\nThe 17-year-old Augustine Pautre, born in Brussels but with Swiss nationality, enrolled at Antwerp academy for the 1898-99 academic year. It was not long before she and Eugeen Van Mieghem met.\n\nAt the end of 1899 the Antwerp entrepreneur François Franck founded the De Kapel cultural society and the empty Lantschot chapel on the Falconrui soon became a lively centre of progressive intellectual life. Exhibitions and musical evenings were held, and writers and well-known personalities entertained an often restless but zealous audience that consisted of bourgeoisie, artists and workers. Though Van Mieghem became a regular visitor to De Kapel, he always remained discretely in the background. He admired the French poet Paul Verlaine and read anarchistic books by Domela Nieuwenhuis, Pierre Kropotkine, Jean Grave, Elisée Reclus, Sébastien Faure and others.\n\nA remarkably large number of Van Mieghem’s works are dated 1899. At the age of 24 he was already displaying great expressiveness and maturity.\n\nSome of his works on paper exude a powerful fin-de-siècle atmosphere. Eugeen’s father died on June 26th. We see Augustine Pautre for the first time in Eugeen’s pastel The Inner City, which he produced the day of his father’s funeral. She is depicted next to Eugeen’s mother. That year the artist also made several noteworthy drawings of churches.\n\nIn 1900 De Scalden mounted an exhibition in the Old Museum in Antwerp comprising works by Van Mieghem and seven other artists. These eight artists then formed a group which called itself Eenigen. In his magazine De Vlaamse School, Pol de Mont encouraged them to go their own way.\n\nAt the end of March De Scalden mounted an exhibition in the Old Museum with work by (among others) Van Mieghem.\n\nThe artist also took part in the Brussels salon held every three years. In the courthouse in Antwerp he showed several of his designs at the exhibition on the theme of Ex libris organized by La Conférence du jeune Barreau. Shortly after that Van Mieghem made the cover design for the 15-year commemorative album of the Flemish Conference of the Antwerp Bar. Between 1900 and 1905 he made a series of drawings in the courthouse in Antwerp which are reminiscent of work by Daumier and Forain.\n\nThe eighth salon of La Libre Esthétique opened in Brussels on March 1st 1901. Ten of Van Mieghem’s works were on show for a month alongside work by Cézanne, Cross, Sérusier, Denis, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Vuillard, Guillaumin, Meunier, Hodler and others.\n\nHe sold several pieces there but despite the fact that his work was received favourably, the artist sought no further contact with Brussels upper middle classes.\n\nIn June De Scalden held a fourth annual exhibition which included work by Van Mieghem.\n\nOn May 28th Eenigen’s second exhibition opened in the Old Museum in Antwerp with several of his works. That year Augustine Pautre graduated from the academy.\n\nIn August the artist took part in the summer exhibition at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique and in September in the triennial salon in Antwerp.\n\nIn May 1903 the Eenigen’s third exhibition opened at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique, which included work by Van Mieghem. From July to September he took part in the fourth Eenigen exhibition at the mondain casino in Blankenberge and from November 28th to December 7th at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique in Antwerp.\n\nIn September the artist showed work at the triennial salon in Brussels and at the Exhibition of watercolour paintings, pastels and etchings organized by the Antwerp Royal Society for the Furtherance of the Fine Arts.\n\nIn November the fifth Eenigen salon opened at the Kunstverbond / Cercle Artistique with work by (among others) Van Mieghem. In January 1904 Lenore Van der Veer published an article entitled Eugene Van Mieghem – An Artist of the People in the London-based Pall Mall Magazine.\n\nIn July the artist and several friends from De Kapel took part in a tribute to the Dutchman Domela Nieuwenhuis, who had championed anarchistic and social causes. A drawing by Van Mieghem appears in the tribute book. During his stay in Amsterdam the artist admired the work of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Breitner. In September he took part in the triennial salon in Antwerp and in October he showed work in Brussels at the annual exhibition of the Brussels group Labeur. In November Van Mieghem took part in the Exhibition of sketching and judicial caricature in Antwerp.\n\nIn November the artist also contributed to the sixth De Scalden exhibition, for which his poster design was chosen as the exhibit image. We recognize Augustine on the right holding a flower.\n\nBy now his family was finding it difficult to make ends meet and in October Van Mieghem had his wife pose as a model for him and several of his friends. The last drawings in which she posed as a healthy young woman are dated December 12th 1904.\n\nAt the beginning of 1905 Augustine became seriously ill with tuberculosis. Van Mieghem dealt with his grief by drawing his sick muse as she wasted away.\n\nHe drew on any available material, using the back of port telegrams, waybills and even mourning cards. The artist never showed these works during his lifetime.\n\nOn February 5th 1905 a preparatory meeting was held for the foundation of the new art society Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain, an initiative of the Antwerp brothers François and Louis Franck. On March 1st the foundation’s meeting proper took place at the home of Louis Franck, but Eugeen did not attend because of Augustine’s deteriorating health.\n\nAugustine died in Brussels on March 12th 1905, at the age of just 24.\n\nOn July 22nd the first Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain salon with work by living artists opened at the Old Museum in Venusstraat. Van Mieghem showed no fewer than 23 works.\n\nIn March 1910 for the first time the artist again showed work at the annual salon of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain. At the end of that year he also took part in the Christmas Exhibition at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique. A re-found zest for life manifested itself in the colour of his pastels.\n\nIn February 1911 he took part in the Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain group salon.\n\nVan Mieghem held his first solo show at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique (now the Arenberg theatre) from November 17th to 28th 1912. He exhibited no fewer than 39 paintings, 52 pastels, watercolours and drawings.\n\nIn 1913 he took part in the Easter Exhibition of the Antwerp Koninklijke Kunstkring / Cercle Royal Artistique d'Anvers, the Salon du Printemps in Brussels and the group salon of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain.\n\nIn March 1914 Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain organized the Second Belgian Salon at the Pulchri Studio in The Hague with works by Ensor, Laermans, Van Rysselberghe, Wouters, Van Mieghem and others.\n\nOn March 7th the annual Antwerp salon of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain opened with no fewer than 29 works by Van Mieghem. The spotlight was on the work of Jakob Smits, Rik Wouters and Van Gogh (with no fewer than 96 pieces!). Van Mieghem was confronted by world-famous paintings like Irises and The Bedroom. He went on to paint Irises and The Alcove.\n\nA month later Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain organized the Sonderausstellung der belgischen Kunstvereinigung L’Art Contemporain in Cologne, which included work by Claus, Ensor, Smits, Vaes and Van Mieghem. That year he became a member of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain, but his increasing national fame as an artist was abruptly interrupted by the German invasion on August 4th.\n\nDuring the bombardment and the siege of Antwerp (October 7th, 8th and 9th) the Van Mieghem family fled the city, as did most other citizens.\n\nEven as they fled, the artist continued to record on paper the desperate flight of the helpless citizens. His mother, with the family around her, is often at the centre of this war work.\n\nAfter the fall of the city, they returned to the café in Antwerp, where they lived through the years of occupation. Van Mieghem helped distribute soup, drew pictures of needy children and produced razor-sharp caricatures of the German occupier.\n\nOn February 3rd 1918 an activist demonstration was held for the independence of Flanders on the initiative of the Flemish nationalist politician August Borms. Afterwards Van Mieghem made a lithograph and several drawings of an incident with the lion flag on Meirplaats.\n\nShortly after the war his mother sold the café and moved into a rest home.\n\nFrom March 8th to 19th Van Mieghem showed his sizable war oeuvre at the Koninklijk Kunstverbond / Cercle royal artistique. Though the reviews were very favourable, sales were poor. People did not wish to be reminded of the suffering of war.\n\nIn April he fell ill and was admitted to Le Fort Jaco sanatorium in Ukkel (Brussels).\n\nThere the artist met the 23-year-old Marguerite Struyvelt. In September 1920 he went to live with her in Antwerp.\n\nIn May a second exhibition of his war work was held in Scheveningen. In the magazine Onze Kunst Georges Eekhoud reviewed his participation in the Salon des aquarellistes belges in Brussels in September in a very positive light. At the end of 1919 Van Mieghem took part in the Exhibition of Antwerp artists in the banquet hall (stadsfeestzaal) on the Meir.\n\nIn February the artist was admitted to a sanatorium in Burtscheid, near Aachen.\n\nIn April Van Mieghem sold the painting Children of the docks at the annual salon of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain to the collector Jozef Beuckeleers.\n\nIn July he took part in the triennial salon in Ghent and in September in the Salon des aquarellistes belges in Brussels.\n\nIn 1922 the artist and his young wife moved to a flat on the second floor at No. 30 Sint-Paulusstraat.\n\nIn April 1923 Van Mieghem showed work at the triennial salon in Antwerp where his Port Rascal was purchased by Cléomir Jussiant. In September the Antwerp museum bought his work Women at the docks at the triennial salon. In September the artist took part in the Salon des aquarellistes belges in Brussels.\n\nOn February 1st Van Mieghem and Struyvelt reached a provisional agreement to divorce.\n\nOwing to his personal problems and ill health, he did not take part in the Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain salon that year.\n\nAt the beginning of July the artist was admitted to Dennenheuvel sanatorium in Ossendrecht (The Netherlands).\n\nIn November his old friend Lode Baekelmans published a very complimentary article about Van Mieghem in De Vlaamse Elsevier. It mentioned the names of the artists he admired. They included Breitner, Israëls, Meunier, Millet, de Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlen and Forain.\n\nIn September Van Mieghem took part in the Salon des aquarellistes belges in Brussels and in the triennial exhibition in Antwerp.\n\nIn October Van Mieghem’s Port Women was shown in an exhibition organized by the Belgian state in the Hungarian capital of Budapest. The work was purchased by the local museum.\n\nIn 1928 the artist took part in the Junge belgische Kunst exhibition in Hannover. For the last time he contributed to the Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain salon, submitting four works.\n\nVan Mieghem’s health rapidly deteriorated. Finding it difficult to get around, he corresponded more with his friends Lode Baekelmans and Ernest Van den Bosch.\n\nIn his pocket diary he made sketches and noted down appointments with doctors and lawyers.\n\nTowards the end of his life the artist produced a cycle on the Stations of the Cross. The painting Christ’s descent from the cross was bought by his friend Willem Elsschot.\n\nIn September the artist showed work at the Salon des aquarellistes belges in Brussels. It was his last exhibition.\n\nIn January Van Mieghem made a series of small, masterly drawings of the objects around him in his flat at No. 30 Sint-Paulusstraat.\n\nOn March 24th 1930 at the age of just 54 the artist died from a traumatic aortic rupture at Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp.\n\nOn his easel was his last painting of a female sack sewer. A quote (in French) by the poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke was found in his pocket diary: “Perhaps you will discover that you are called to be an artist. Then take that destiny upon yourself, and bear it, its burden and its greatness, without ever asking what reward might come from outside. For the creator must be a world for himself and must find everything in himself and in nature, to whom his whole life is devoted.”\n\nKunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain organized a major Van Mieghem retrospective in its\n\npavilion at the 1930 World Fair in Antwerp. The art book planned by Ernest Van den Bosch\n\nwas postponed because of the economic downturn and in the end it was never published.\n\nThe artist’s son did publish a portfolio of 30 etchings. Thirty copies were printed\n\nposthumously.\n\nIn October 1930 the Galerie d’Art Kodak in Brussels organized a retrospective.\n\nIn 1931 work by Van Mieghem was shown at the 100 Years of Belgian Art exhibition at Van\n\nWisselingh & Co in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1933 and 1935 the Antwerp gallery Breckpot organized Van Mieghem retrospectives.\n\nIn 1933, 16 of his paintings were exhibited at the Belgian Art exhibition in Stockholm, Malmö\n\nand Oslo.\n\nIn 1935 his work was shown at the exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels to mark\n\nthe 30th birthday of Kunst van Heden / L'Art Contemporain.\n\nIn 1944 Antwerp city council organized a retrospective at the Stedelijk Kunstsalon. With the\n\nemergence of new art movements after the Second World War, sadly, Van Mieghem’s work\n\npassed into oblivion.\n\nIn 1958 former pupil Jan de Schutter worked on a Van Mieghem retrospective at the\n\nStedelijk Kunstsalon in Antwerp and in 1968 the Emile Verhaeren Museum mounted a\n\nretrospective.\n\nIn 1975 Frits Danckaert and Remi de Cnodder organized a retrospective at the Antwerp\n\nWaterworks to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the artist’s birth.\n\nIn 1975 the Antwerp insurance group Apra published the book Mensen van toen (People of\n\nthe time), reproductions of pencil sketches by Van Mieghem from a 1905 sketchbook.\n\nOn August 16th 1982 the Eugeen Van Mieghem Foundation was established."
