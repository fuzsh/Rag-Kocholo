Glass photo: Hygiëna Lembeek (Hondzocht) Louis Paul 1860-1929 Founded originally as Brasserie de Sint-Roch. Delplancq suggests the origins of the name \"Gueuze\" were tied to Louis Paul from Brasserie Hygiëna in Lembeek, who in 1870 had the nickname \"Geus\" for his liberal politics. The brewery was also believed to have adapted the champenois method for lambic from Dom Pérignon, a French champagne producer. The people of Lembeek therefore called this beer \"lambiek van bij de Geus\" or \"lambic of the Geus brewery\". Delplancq, Thierry. Les Brasseurs du Lambic: Données Historiques et Géographiques. P. 262-263. Around 1875, the brewery engineer Cayaerts began bottling Gueuze Lambic. The brewery was sold to Pierre Troch in 1898.

The brewery and warehouse buildings were sold to Jozef De Vits, a local tavern owner and gueuze-blender.
