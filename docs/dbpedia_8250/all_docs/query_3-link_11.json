        "text": "To conjure Jean Stein you must first imagine the voice — a soft and breathy near-whisper, by turns merry or full of steel. It was a voice suited to late-night telephone conversations and dinners at the corner tables of now-forgotten Manhattan restaurants.\n\nThat voice ranked among the gifts she brought to her mastery of the oral history — as demonstrated in a classic of the form, “Edie: An American Biography” (Knopf, 1982).\n\nEdie Sedgwick, the tragic Warhol superstar and aristocrat who was the subject of her book, “touched so many worlds,” Ms. Stein said in a 1982 radio interview.\n\nThe same could have been said of Ms. Stein herself, who committed suicide on April 30. She was 83.\n\nAlthough her obituaries noted her books, her stewardship of the literary magazine Grand Street and the arts patronage she underwrote with a fortune inherited from her father, Jules Stein, a founder of the Music Corporation of America, in the private reminiscences of friends, it was her role as connector and collector of people that formed a leitmotif.\n\nNowhere was this more evident than at the parties she gave, first at her parents’ Beverly Hills estate, Misty Mountain, in later decades at a rambling Upper West Side apartment overlooking Central Park and, finally, at a terraced triplex on the East River.\n\nAt these parties one was as likely to encounter Warren Beatty as the Russian dissident poet Andrei Voznesensky. Among the guests were Tennessee Williams in boozy conversation with Truman Capote, Allen Ginsberg in knotty confabulation with John Cage, and Norman Mailer putting on a performance of knuckle-dragging machismo for the apparent benefit of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
