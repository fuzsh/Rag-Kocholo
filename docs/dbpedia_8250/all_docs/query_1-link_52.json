        "text": "Cornelis (“Kees”) de Jager passed away on May 27, 2021 in the village on the island of Texel where he was born, four weeks after video-attending the celebration of his 100th birthday at his own Museum Sterrenwacht Sonnenborgh in Utrecht. During these weeks he enjoyed over 50 video congratulations from pupils and colleagues.\n\nHe was a giant in our field and far beyond, ranging widely through the spectrum in solar physics and through stellar physics, educating many astrophysicists, traveling wide as inventive and effective science diplomat, founding institutes, journals and societies, intensely active in popularization – and running marathons as well. Always friendly, cooperative, attentive, positive and optimistic. A wonderful person and a great scientist.\n\nAfter childhood in Indonesia he came to Sonnenborgh as a student in 1939, hid there from deportation to Germany during World War II, completed his PhD thesis (1952RAOU….1…..D) in 1952, succeeded M.G.J. Minnaert in 1963 as director and moved with Doetie and their four children into the director’s mansion, and finally returned to Texel in 2003.\n\nHe wrote a highly recommended, characteristically well-written and humorous overview of his rich life and career in “A red and a white star” (1996SoPh..169..443D) in the special Solar Physics issue for his 75th birthday. I refer to this for detail on his research and on his founding astrophysics at Brussels Free University, becoming director of the Utrecht Observatory, founding Utrecht and hence Dutch space research, the satellite instrumentation developed there, starting Space Science Reviews and co-starting Solar Physics, being IAU General Secretary and twice COSPAR President, and much more. His role in ESA is well described by Roger Bonnet in the same issue (1996SoPh..169..233B).\n\nSince then he turned Sterrenwacht Sonnenborgh into a successful science museum, during many years giving monthly lectures on anything astronomical in the news during the weeks before and turning these into books, also after his return to Texel. He also co-founded and chaired the Dutch and European skeptical societies debunking pseudoscience.\n\nOn Texel he delved into local history, also lecturing on that, and became guest worker at the Dutch institute for maritime research there, at their request turning to relations between solar activity and climate which led to 10 more publications while also co-authoring further studies on hypergiants. He put these 10 together in “Solar magnetic variability and climate” with Silvia Duhau (Buenos Aires) and Ad Nieuwenhuizen (Utrecht) last June.\n\nAmong other many other awards he received the Karl Schwarzschild Medal in 1974, the Prix Jules Janssen and the Gagarin Medal in 1984, the Ziolkowskiy Medal in 1987, the Hale Prize and the RAS Gold Medal in 1988, honorary citizenship of Texel in 2006 – and also held the age record of Dutch marathon runners (New York at 75).\n\nPhD (co-)adviser: at Utrecht M.
