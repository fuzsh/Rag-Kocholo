        "text": "Jean Stein (1934-2017) was an American author, oral historian, editor, and philanthropist. Jean Babette Stein was born on February 9th, 1934 in Chicago, Illinois to Jules C. Stein and Doris Jones Stein. Her father, Jules Stein, co-founded the music booking agency Music Corporation of America (MCA) with William R. Goodheart, Jr. in 1929. This company, which initially pioneered the system of musicians touring America, would branch out into radio and open offices in New York, before eventually landing in Hollywood in 1937, at the recommendation of Stein's partner Lew Wasserman. Now known simply as MCA, it became one of the leading talent agencies in the country, representing such stars as Bette Davis, Betty Grable, Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Eddie Cantor, Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra, and Jack Benny.\n\nAs the daughter of such a prominent film industry figure, Jean Stein grew up in an atmosphere of fame, wealth, and movie stars. Many of her father's famous clients were frequent guests at Misty Mountain, the family's Beverly Hills estate, and Stein played with the children of movie stars and moguls throughout her childhood.\n\nStein studied at both Wellesley College and the Sorbonne, in Paris, France. Much of her early 20s were spent living abroad in Paris, Rome, Venice, and other European cities, as well as in New York, where she worked as assistant to director Elia Kazan on the original production of Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955). In 1954, while visiting St. Moritz, nineteen year old Stein met the legendary American novelist William Faulkner and they began a love affair. Faulkner was then fifty-six and married, but the affair continued until Stein met the man who would become her first husband, William vanden Heuvel. During their relationship, Stein persuaded the usually reticent Faulkner to allow her to interview him. The interview was subsequently published in The Paris Review in 1956, and Stein became an editor there, working for George Plimpton.\n\nStein moved back to New York City to work at Esquire, as an assistant to features editor Clay Felker. In 1958, Stein married lawyer and diplomat William vanden Heuvel, whose position as special assistant to Robert Kennedy, during the latter's tenure as United States Attorney General put Stein in Kennedy's circle and inspired her first book. Stein and vanden Heuvel were among the group that traveled with Kennedy's body from New York to Washington after his assassination in 1968. This trip was the subject of American Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy (1970), which was edited by George Plimpton.\n\nLiving in New York during the 1960s, Stein was part of the world of the artistic, intellectual, political, and literary intelligentsia. Among her friends was Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick, and Stein considered her the perfect symbol for the 1960s. Sedgwick's tragic life, and her journey from socialite to superstar to death at age 28 by drug overdose would be the subject of Stein's next oral history, Edie: An American Biography (1982) (reprinted in 1994 as Edie: American Girl). The text was composed entirely of interviews Stein conducted with friends, colleagues and family of Sedgwick, and was also edited by George Plimpton. Edie was an international best-seller.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2004, Stein was the co-editor (with Walter Hopps) of Grand Street, the literary/visual arts magazine.\n\nStein's third book, West of Eden: An American Place (2016), told the stories (again though oral histories) of five families or individuals who shaped the history of Los Angeles. The book dedicated chapters to Los Angeles' first oil tycoon Edward Doheny and his family; Warner Bothers mogul Jack Warner and his family; Jane Garland, the mentally ill daughter of Hollywood real estate executive William Garland and would-be actress Grace Nicholls; the movie star Jennifer Jones, her three famous husbands (Robert Walker, David O'Selznick, and Norton Simon), and three children; and Stein's own family, and the founding of her father's company, MCA.\n\nIn 2016 Jean Stein partnered with PEN America to found the $75,000 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award and the $10,000 PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Oral History.\n\nJean Stein was married to William vanden Heuvel from 1958 to 1970. The marriage produced two daughters, editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel, and actress Wendy vanden Heuvel. Stein was married to Nobel Prize-winning Swedish neurobiologist Torsten Wiesel from 1995 to 2007. Jean Stein died in Manhattan on April 30, 2017."
