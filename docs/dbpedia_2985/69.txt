Lake Tegel is located in the north of Berlin. With an area of four and a half square kilometers, it is the second largest lake in Berlin - and one of the most beautiful. Numerous excursion boats sail here and you can watch the sailing boats pass by on the benches.

Or you can just grab a boat yourself from the boat rental and explore the huge bay on your own.

A feeling, a little like at the sea. Wide looks. Beautiful sunset mood. Stroll and enjoy‼‼‼
