While you aren’t finding much in the centre of the city, the best lakes in Berlin for wild swimming are easily reachable by public transport, affording the intrepid explorer their own private patch of paradise at the height of summer. Brandenburg (the state that encircles Berlin) is known as the land of 3,000 lakes, giving plenty of options for revitalisation after the intensity of the German capital.\n\nOkay, an afternoon of wild swimming isn’t going to fix all of the damage caused by Berlin’s vices, but it is an experience and a half for anyone willing to jump in."
