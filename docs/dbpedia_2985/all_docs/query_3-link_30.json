        "text": "One of Berlinâ€™s great assets is its variety of bathing waters. No matter which lake suits your taste, whether small and hidden or action-packed and popular, you could discover a new one every weekend. Everyone knows the classics like Wannsee, MÃ¼ggelsee or Schlachtensee and they are often frequented for good reason. But it is often worth making the slightly longer journey to Brandenburg.\n\n1. Amber Lake (Barnim Nature Park)\n\nAs the Bernsteinsee is just under 80 kilometers from Berlin city center, those with a car have a clear advantage. Several bays and two large sandy beaches offer enough space to spread out; the water of the gravel lake is clear and cool. Even if the lake is no longer an absolute insider tip, the day trip is worthwhile.\n\n2. Lake Liepnitz\n\nA little further south you will find the Liepnitzsee with its striking GroÃŸer Werder. You can reach it either by ferry or by swimming. The atmosphere is informal, and beautiful jetties jut out into the water everywhere â€“ definitely worth a visit.\n\n3. Clay lake\n\nThe clay lakeis just as natural and much smaller. The path to the water leads through a beautiful forest, past a campsite. You can either take a seat in the forest, on the main meadow or, with a little more privacy, in beautiful spots around the lake.\n\n4. Lake Habermann\n\nThe three Kaulsdorf lakes are quarry ponds in the middle of a water protection area and as such are not explicitly bathing lakes. Letâ€™s hope that the district authority will continue to tolerate their use. One of them is Habermannsee, actually two lakes in one, divided by a peninsula. A paradise for swimmers and sun-seekers, sandy beaches and shady spots offer a good balance here.\n\n5. PlÃ¶tzensee\n\nFor those who want a little more action, PlÃ¶tzensee in Wedding is the place to go. You can chill out at the lido, hire a boat or get naked on the nudist jetty. Thereâ€™s definitely an atmosphere here.\n\n6. Virgin Lake\n\nThe Jungfernsee is crossed by the Havel and begins at the Glienicke Bridge. Most of its territory belongs to Postdam, apart from a small triangle that is Berlin. There are two easily accessible bathing spots near Cecilienhof Palace. Unfortunately, its northern shore offers no opportunity to go into the water.\n\n7. GroÃŸ Glienicker See\n\nThe neighboring Jungfernsee between GroÃŸ Glienicke and Kladow shimmers in all shades of blue. The water is extremely clear with visibility up to 4 meters. Two bathing spots on its northern side invite you to linger on the fine sand. ðŸ¥½\n\n8. Langer See (Dahme)\n\nThe Long Lake is really long: 11 km. This has the advantage that you will find countless places by the water here. If you take the S-Bahn to GrÃ¼nau, you can either take the streetcar along the lake or walk through the forest by the lake. There is also a beautiful, newly renovated lido.\n\n9. Large MÃ¼ggelsee\n\nThe MÃ¼ggelsee offers pretty much everything your heart desires. A rustic lido with GDR flair, boat rentals and natural spots where you can be completely undisturbed. Thanks to its size, you almost feel like youâ€™re by the sea at times."
