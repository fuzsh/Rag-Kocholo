        "text": "North, East, South and West of Berlin:\n\nDiscover Our Four Favourites\n\nEvery time we sit down for an interview, we’re asked to divulge which lakes are our personal favourites. That never ceases to be a tricky question to answer. The challenge is that if you set out from Berlin in search of lakes that aren’t overrun by crowds of people, you have around 3,000 lakes to choose from in Brandenburg alone. As you can imagine, it’s highly unlikely that either of us will be able to explore all of them, let alone all the lakes in Germany, our lifetimes.\n\nBerlin itself plays host to a series of rather popular lakes and public beaches, such as Wannsee and Plötzensee. In fact, some bathing spots in the city, such as those located around Tegeler See’s shorelines, are so renowned that even newbies have taken to flocking to their shores. In Brandenburg, on the other hand, you’ll come across a significantly higher number of smaller and lesser-known lakes that are worth journeying out of town for.\n\nIt’s good to keep in mind that the lakes we’ve listed up top are our personal favourites—we’re by no means suggesting that everyone will find what they’re looking for in precisely these four places. If you’re searching for something specific, such as a lake with an official public beach, playground, boat rental, or restroom, you’ll find our top 50 selection of the most beautiful lakes in Berlin and Brandenburg in our Take Me to the Lakes – Berlin Edition. The great thing about the abundance of lakes in this region of Germany is that there truly is something to suit everyone.\n\nSeveral years back, when we first set out to research this book, we visited over 120 lakes in Berlin and Brandenburg. Today, we’re delighted to be able to share the knowledge we collected about water quality and bathing spots with you. If you’re yearning to spend more than just a day at the water’s edge, you’ll also find 50 wonderful accommodations in our Take Me to the Lakes – Weekender Edition Berlin Vol. I and our Weekender Edition Berlin Vol. II. Plan your next vacation in Berlin, Brandenburg or Mecklenburg Vorpommern and discover which lakes nearest to each accommodation you can swim in.\n\nWhether your heart is set on discovering waters in Berlin or Brandenburg, we wish you heaps of fun and relaxation while swimming in our favourite lakes!\n\nKaro & Nils"
