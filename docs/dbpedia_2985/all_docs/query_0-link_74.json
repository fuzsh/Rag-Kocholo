        "text": "The former “Borsigvilla” in Liesborner Weg 19, built in 1912, is located on Lake Tegel on a quiet private road that is only accessible to residents and was originally used as a manufacturer’s villa. It comes from the former private property of the Borsig family, who ran the well-known “Borsigwerke” in Berlin, a mechanical engineering company that significantly advanced industrialization with the construction of locomotives and steam engines.\n\nThe villa at Liesborner Weg 19 is one of several preserved buildings from the private property of the Borsig family. It has a total area of ​​approx. 738 m² spread over two full floors, an attic and a partial basement.\n\nThe building is accessed through the very representative entrance area, which extends over two floors. On the first floor there is an approx. 50 m² roof terrace. On the west side there is a covered terrace area with round columns on the ground floor.\n\nThe villa stands on a spacious plot of approx. 2.900 m² just a few meters from the shores of Lake Tegel."
