        "text": "Berlin Lake is one of Ohio’s largest inland lakes with over 3,000 acres, making it ideal for all boating activities and fishing. Constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1942, Berlin Lake sits on the Mahoning River at the intersection of Stark, Portage and Mahoning counties.\n\nBerlin Water Adventures and Jet Ski Rentals\n\nBerlin Water Adventures offers water activity rentals with reservations by calling 330-257-6336 or visiting their official website at berlinwateradventures.com.

VX Cruiser and VX Sport are both available options.\n\nPontoon Boat\n\nWant to explore the water with a little less zip than a jet ski? These spacious pontoon boats can fit up to eight people (and your cooler). Hit the lake on a pontoon and you can simply relax, bathe in the sun or fish.\n\nNote: Berlin Lake has no horsepower restriction during the day, but enforces a 10 MPH speed limit for boats at night.\n\nGoing as a Group?\n\nWhether you’re a church group, corporate team, Boy or Girl Scout Troop or a family reunion, Berlin Water Adventures offers rentals for groups at a discounted rate. You can also save 10% per hour if you rent both a jet ski and a pontoon.\n\nCanoes\n\nCanoe rentals can fit up to two people for small lake getaways and adventures. Paddle through Berlin Lake’s inlets or coves and see it like never before.\n\nKayaks\n\nBreak from the group and go on a self-paced ride to explore the branches of the main part of the lake on these single-passenger kayaks. Find a secluded fishing spot or enjoy watching the wildlife off the water.\n\nPaddleboards\n\nPaddleboards are the newest addition to Berlin Adventures’ rental options. Test your balance, get your ab workout in and soak up the sun on their 12-foot, foam-core paddleboards.\n\nFishing\n\nSpring is the best time to fish the lake; live bait and spinning lures are most effective. There are many great fishing access points across Berlin Lake thanks to the various boat launching sites and docks. Diverse sport fish populations include largemouth and smallmouth bass, white bass, walleye, white crappie, black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, brown bullhead and muskellunge.\n\nWildlife Area\n\nUpland game species are found across the 8,518-acre wildlife area. Rabbits, squirrels and woodcocks can be spotted throughout the brushy uplands, woods and wet meadows. In addition to designated hunting areas, there is also an the archery shooting range that is open from sunrise to sunset with no fee.\n\nBirdwatching\n\nThe beautiful birds of the area are a sight to see at Berlin Lake! You can spot a great variety of songbirds and shorebirds, but the main event is bald eagles, which can be seen during their migration.\n\nMill Creek Recreation Area\n\nLocated on Berlin Lake, the Mill Creek Recreation Area is a great place for picnicking, fishing, hunting, camping and other recreational activities.
