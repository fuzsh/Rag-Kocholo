        "text": "Anyone been out to silver lake off the turnpike lately? whats the water condition like has the weeds locked the place in yet or is it still fishable I did notice nobodys made post on it lately\n\n_________________\n\nI Love to fish......Not a big fan of sitting in the boat alone ....the Conversation and the company make it perfect Well I've only diven by a couple times in the last couple weeks, but it looked pretty decent from the road. You can see it pretty clearly from the Berlin Tpk. It's not really a over heavily fished spot Bob, more idiots in rec. boats I believe. There's a couple guys on here that say they do pretty well with the toads or floating frogs this time fo year. Supposed to be sone decent fish in there. Good luck if you go, and post results. It's only a few miles from me, only been there once last fall, got a couple that's about it. ya i use to go there in the past been looking for someplace close for a run to spot at night this place use to jam up pretty heavy with salad let ya know how we do\n\n_________________\n\nI Love to fish......Not a big fan of sitting in the boat alone ....the Conversation and the company make it perfect I live very close to it, I heard it's over flooded with weeds - worse than last year. I went there twice this year earlier in the year but it wasn't too bad. The problem is I believe the light winter hurt. Definitely a fun place for topwater action.\n\n_________________\n\nSteve you been bye there lately sap last week or so ?\n\nIf you find yourself in the area give it a look over for me will ya hate to drag the boat up there just to make chop salad\n\n_________________\n\nI Love to fish......Not a big fan of sitting in the boat alone ....the Conversation and the company make it perfect I live 2 minutes down the road from silver lake but have only been there twice this year because the weeds look worse than last year. I have also noticed a lot less fishermen than usual."
