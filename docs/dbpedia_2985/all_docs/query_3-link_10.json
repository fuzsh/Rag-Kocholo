        "text": "Lake, here we come! From this week onwards, Berlin is once again blessed with summery weather that is perfect for swimming. It’s about time after several weeks of constant rain and during the vacation season of all times. Find out here which lakes in and around Berlin you can reach by public transport!\n\nLake Tegel\n\nLocated in the north-west of Berlin, it is one of the largest lakes in Berlin and can be conveniently reached via a subway line! From Alt-Tegel station, you can reach the foothills of the lake in around five minutes on foot. The lake is also easy to reach by S-Bahn. In this case, you can take the S25 to Tegel station. From here it is about 15 minutes on foot. Once you arrive at the lake, there are plenty of restaurants, woodland areas and boats to explore.\n\nAirport lake\n\nYou can also reach this lake via subway line 6 from Otisstraße station. From here, a short forest walk takes you to the water at the future Schumacher Quartier. As the line is currently closed due to construction work, you can also travel via the U8. This then stops at Rathaus Reinickendorf and from here the X33 will take you to Sterkrader Straße, from where it is about a 10-minute walk to the lake. Here you will find plenty of nature and a few large and small sandy beaches.\n\nWhite Lake\n\nThis time you can get here by streetcar 12! You can reach it from the Falkenberger Str./Berliner Allee station. There are plenty of green areas around the small lake where you can take a break in the shade. Those who prefer to sunbathe can do so from the Weißensee lido. Here you can hire sun loungers and parasols on the artificial beach and dive into the cool water. Please note: Swimming is prohibited in the rest of the White Lake!\n\nMüggelsee\n\nThe streetcar line 60 is the ideal way to get to the largest lake in Berlin. It then stops at Josef-Nawrocki-Straße, virtually directly on the shore. From here there are plenty of options: You can plunge into the water for free at the “Teppich” bathing area, while the Stadtbad Friedrichshagen offers a beach feeling and stand-up paddling. If you have a little more patience, you can continue on and find one of the countless official or improvised swimming spots that nestle in the 7m² of water. There are also landing stages for boat tours and a number of water sports equipment rentals, with which you can explore the huge lake and its side arms.\n\nRiver bathing on the Dahme\n\nNot far from the Müggelsee lake, the Dahme meanders through picturesque Köpenick. In addition to a few free swimming spots, there is also a riverside pool, which can be easily reached by streetcar line 60 (or currently by a replacement bus) . These then stop at Schlossplatz Köpenick station, from where it is about a ten-minute walk to the baths. There are also canoes and boats for hire here, allowing you to glide leisurely along the river.\n\nSchlachtensee\n\nThis lake is located in the south of Berlin in Grunewald and is easy to reach on the S1. The train stops directly on the riverbank at the S-Bahn station of the same name. From here you can reach a bad spot in just a few minutes on foot or explore the wooded areas around the pond. There is also a boat rental service here!\n\nGroß Glienicker See"
