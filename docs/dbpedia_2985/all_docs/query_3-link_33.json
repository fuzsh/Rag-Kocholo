        "text": "Top 10 lakes in and around Berlin: Perfect for hot summer days\n\n29. Juni 2023 Lisa Backsen\n\nWhat could be better in summer than a family outing to a swimming lake in and around Berlin? Swimming, splashing around, building sandcastles, or simply enjoying nature - it's just perfect for these summertime temperatures! Berlin and Brandenburg, in particular, offer plenty of options for families with children, with over 3,000 lakes to choose from. To make your selection easier, we have compiled a list of our favorite lakes for swimming with children in Berlin and the surrounding area. The distances mentioned are calculated from Berlin Mitte. We wish you a fantastic time with your children and lots of fun swimming!\n\nAuf einen Blick\n\n1. Gorinsee\n\n2. Störitzsee\n\n3. Scharmützelsee\n\n4. Dreetzsee\n\n5. Großer Müllroser See\n\n6. Bergwitzsee\n\n7. Liepnitzsee\n\n8. Stechlinsee\n\n9. Sacrower See\n\n10. Krumme Lanke\n\n1. Gorinsee near Bernau\n\nThe Gorinsee offers everything you could imagine in a perfect lake. There are sandy beaches that provide easy access to the water. The shoreline is shallow and particularly suitable for young children. The deepest part of the lake is only about 2 meters deep, making it ideal for swimming as parents can literally stand by their child's side. For leisurely walks, there is a scenic forest path around the lake. By the way, the Gasthaus am Gorinsee is the perfect place to grab a bite to eat in between or after swimming.\n\n⚑ Wandlitz | Free access | Discover Gorinsee\n\n2. Störitzsee in Müggelspree area\n\nAt Störitzsee, there are three official bathing areas to choose from. Make yourself comfortable at one of the two free bathing spots and enjoy the untouched nature. For those looking for more amenities, a visit to the International Children, Youth, and Family Camp Störitzland is recommended. As day visitors, you can enjoy the supervised swimming facilities for a small admission fee and also find playgrounds, a beach kiosk, and toilets.\n\n⚑ Grünheide | Ticket: 4,50€ |Discover Störitzsee\n\n3. Scharmützelsee\n\nAs the largest and deepest lake in Brandenburg, the Scharmützelsee offers a plethora of water activities. Sailing, paddling, windsurfing, rowing, diving, and, of course, swimming, cater to water sports enthusiasts. However, everyone can find something to enjoy here. Whether you want to splash around in the water or simply relax and sunbathe, the Scharmützelsee is ideal. The bike path around the lake is also popular, with its gentle hills suitable for children as well.\n\n⚑ Bad Saarow| Free access |Discover Scharmützelsee\n\n4. Dreetzsee\n\nIf you're planning a camping trip, we recommend the campground at Dreetzsee. There is plenty for children to explore here. The campground offers a huge beach area that provides optimal access to the lake. However, even without camping, a visit to Dreetzsee is worthwhile. With its untouched nature, it is truly a unique haven for relaxation.\n\n⚑ Löwenberger Land | Ticket: 3 Euro |Discover Dretzsee\n\n5. Großer Müllroser See\n\nThe Großer Müllroser See, like the other lakes, offers the opportunity to explore nature and also has its own small bathing area. What makes it unique is that it has both a beach and an outdoor swimming pool. The beach bath, located on the western shore, has a supervised swimming area with a sandy beach, a restaurant for refreshments, and even a diving board. On the eastern shore, the outdoor swimming pool offers a sandy beach and a spacious sunbathing lawn. There is also a kiosk, playground, and sports field available. Both locations have a small entrance fee of under 2 euros.\n\n⚑ Müllrose | Ticket: 2,00 Euro |Discover Große Müllroser See\n\n6. Bergwitzsee\n\nThe crystal-clear Bergwitzsee entices visitors with its breathtaking landscapes, several UNESCO World Heritage sites, and a family-friendly camping and water sports park. If you choose to stay with your family, the floating holiday homes provide a unique experience. At Bergwitzsee, everything is taken care of: activities for the whole family, camping in tents, bungalows, or holiday apartments, and there's always a snack bar nearby for a quick bite to eat.\n\n⚑ Kemberg| Free Access |Discover Bergwitzsee\n\n7. Liepnitzsee\n\nThe Liepnitzsee is consistently featured in every list of the most beautiful and best lakes in Berlin and its surroundings. For a good reason! After enjoying a leisurely swim and sunbathing on the shore, a trip to Liepnitz Island is a real highlight. The island is located in the middle of the lake and can even be reached by swimming, but we recommend taking the ferry or bringing your own inflatable boat for a family trip.\n\n⚑ Lanke| Tickets: adults 4 Euro, children (1-14 years) 2 Euro |Discover Liepnitzsee\n\n8. Stechlinsee\n\nWith its crystal-clear water, shallow beaches, and small coves, the Stechlinsee is particularly popular as a bathing lake and diving spot. The novel \"Der Stechlin\" by Theodor Fontane brought nationwide fame to the lake in the past. Today, the atmosphere at the Stechlinsee is rather calm and peaceful. If you want to avoid crowds, spending a weekend in a charming holiday home by the Stechlinsee is definitely worth it.\n\n⚑ Stechlinsee| Free access |Discover Stechlinsee\n\n9. Sacrower See\n\nThe Sacrower See is particularly known for its excellent water quality. With visibility of over 4 meters, it attracts many swimming enthusiasts. Despite its popularity, the lake is worth a visit. With two bathing areas and a beer garden right by the water, it's a great place to spend a hot day. If you have some extra time, you can also explore the Sacrower Heilandskirche, which is located directly by the water.\n\n⚑ Bergedorf| Free access |Discover Sacrower See\n\n10. Krumme Lanke\n\nThe natural land lake Krumme Lanke has long ceased to be a hidden gem. While many locals enjoy the tranquility for extended walks between autumn and spring, the summer months belong to children splashing in the water. You can swim alongside swans and ducks or play and dig in the sandy beach areas. At the eastern end of Schlachtensee, approximately 350 meters from Krumme Lanke, you can replenish your energy at the Fischerhütte (fisherman's hut).\n\n⚑ Steglitz-Zehlendorf | Free access |Discover Krumme Lanke\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our personal selection of our favorite lakes in Berlin, and we wish you lots of fun splashing around!\n\nDiese Artikel könnten euch auch interessieren:\n\nDiese Angebote könnten dich auch interessieren\n\nMeldet euch für den Kindaling Newsletter an und erhaltet wöchentlich tolle Veranstaltungstipps und spannende Beiträge rund ums Thema Familie!"
