        "text": "If you’re holidaying in Berlin you’ll have plenty of opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of the big city. You can enjoy hot summer days in one of the trendy beach bars or open-air pools. But if you’re looking for the ultimate beachside experience you’re best off visiting one of the many lakes of Berlin. Whether you’re looking for a classic bathing beach or a hidden gem, the city on the Spree has plenty of bathing spots for its sweltering visitors to enjoy. We will introduce some of the lakes to you, so that you know what to do when the going gets hot!\n\nGroßer Wannsee: Bathing with tradition\n\nLake Großer Wannsee with Berlin’s most popular bathing beach is in the south-west of Berlin: the Wannsee lido was opened in 1907 and it has everything your heart desires: wicker beach chairs, a slide and a nudist area. Nearby you find the lakeside promenade and its mooring area. This is the starting point of the boat cruises across several of Berlin’s lakes. And if you’d rather not spend money on a cruise but would still like to go on a boat ride, then why not take the ferry to Berlin Kladow, which is part of the local public transport system. If you like it more sophisticated, then why not visit the museum café at the Liebermann Villa after a day of swimming in Lake Großer Wannsee. It affords a view of the lake and is abuzz with art and culture. The lake is also easy to get to: it’s a short ride on the S-Bahn, which leaves from Berlin main railway station just outside our MEININGER Hotel.\n\nKleiner Wannsee: Tranquil lake with a dramatic history\n\nLake Kleiner Wannsee is a bit more quiet. The water is less wild, making it perfect for a canoe trip to Potsdam. After a day by the lake, literature enthusiasts can take the audio tour filled with information and stories about Heinrich von Kleist. In 1811 the playwright took his own life here together with his lover.\n\nTegeler See: A pretty lake perfect for relaxing and taking strolls\n\nLake Tegeler See is in the north-east of Berlin, in the Reinickendorf district. There is plenty of room for all captains of sailing boats and pedal boats on Berlin’s second-largest lake. You can take a stroll along the Greenwich Promenade. It’s always busy here when the weather is nice, and there is also a café. It’s much quieter away from the Tegel lido, where you can enjoy the lake’s countless natural bathing spots and many islands.\n\nFlughafensee: Cooling down with a difference\n\nBerlin’s Lake Flughafensee is near Tegel airport. Here you can relax on the large sand dune or in the shade under the trees. If you’re feeling energetic, why not plunge into the cool water before taking a walk around the lake – at the southern end you will find the runway of Tegel airport.\n\nJungfernheideteich: A lake of surprises\n\nLake Jungfernheideteich is an insiders’ tip in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In the summer, many locals from the surrounding area spend their days off in the lido with its snazzy rafts and fun water activities. The other side of the lake is perfect for those who like it a bit more tranquil and casual. The more adventurous among us will love the Jungfernheide tight-rope garden, which offers great views across the park from lofty heights. This lake is also only half an hour away from our MEININGER Hotel.\n\nMüggelspree and Müggelsee: The water worlds of Köpenick\n\nBerlin’s largest lake offers deserted beaches, hiking and cycle paths and plenty of water sports activities. From stand-up paddling to private boat tours – no need for a driver’s licence – here you can combine swimming with the activity of your choice. This is an expansive lake that’s best explored by bike.\n\nThe Müggelspree, which feeds into the large lake, you find the restaurant Die Arche. It is located in the middle of the water and can only be reached by motorboat, which takes visitors to and from the restaurant every 15 minutes. The landlord smokes his own fish. Here you can enjoy a cold beer and some fresh trout after a glorious day by the lake."
