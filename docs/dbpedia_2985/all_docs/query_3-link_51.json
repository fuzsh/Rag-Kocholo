        "meta_description": "Crystal-clear water, secluded coves and fine powdery sand - the lakes of Berlin and the greater Berlin area are really a shangri-la for tired city-dwellers looking for a refreshing swim. The team of Top10 Berlin has packed the swimsuits and set out to find the best places to go for a swim and bask in the sun. Our findings astonished even us: there are still lots of unknown bathing lakes! Have fun exploring our true insiders' tips for bathing lakes. Tip: If you want daily updates of water quality of the lakes, try the following websites. For Berlin: www.badegewaesser.berlin.de, for Brandenburg: href=\"http://www.brandenburg.de/badestellen/\" target=\"_blank\">www.brandenburg.de/badestellen. Remark: Due to the long and hot summer weather, there is a higher risk of wildfires in the woods and forests of Berlin. Therefore, smoking in the forest or its proximity (on the beaches of the Havel and the lakes for example) is absolutely forbidden, the same goes for BBQs or camp fires in the woods or cigarette stubs thrown carelessly from car windows.",

        "text": "Purest water, sand as fine as powder and a beer garden right on the beach - do you need anything more to be happy?\n\nNot only the extremely clear water with a depth visibility of up to 4 metres but also two green enchanted little islands in the lake make Groß-Glienicker See very special to its visitors.\n\nNestled away in the forest under pine trees you will find the bathing beach Kleiner Müggelsee.\n\nTucked away in the Grunewald, deserted and absolutely peaceful - if you prefer a calmer place to go for a swim, the bathing spot Badestelle Kuhhorn on the banks of the Havel might just be the place for you.\n\nLiepnitzsee with its crystal-clear water has long ceased to be an insiders' tip, yet it is still quite picturesque.\n\nA large sandy beach, shaded spots in a small grove and several small bathing spots in the Lieper Bucht open the view of the river Havel and the island Lindwerder.\n\nSeveral bathing spots, a small historical bathing marina and truly idyllic recreational greens create a little paradise for swimmers on Straussee.\n\nIf you can't do without amenities like changing rooms, restrooms and snack bars, you should go for a swim at Strandbad Orankesee.\n\nPlötzensee is not really an insiders' tip tucked away off the beaten track, it's much more centrally located in the city - in the heart of Berlin-Wedding. It is, so to speak, a lake with S-Bahn connection."
