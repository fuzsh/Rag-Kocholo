        "text": "This is the perfect tour for a bathing excursion to Lake Tegel. We cycle along its shore in a relaxed manner and have the opportunity to cool off or rest in one of the beer bars.\n\neasy\n\nDistance 21.1 km\n\nDuration1:30 h\n\nAscent7 m\n\nDescent7 m\n\nHighest point36 m\n\nLowest point29 m\n\nWe start our tour at the Rathaus Spandau underground station and cycle north on the cycle path along the Altstädter Ring. On our right we see the old town of Spandau with the church (1) St. Nikolai. At the large roundabout of Falkenberger Platz we decide to take the second exit and cycle straight ahead onto Neuendorfer Strasse. We follow this road for a while, turn right at the Lidl supermarket into Eiswerderstrasse and cross the Havel on the bridge to Eiswerder Island. On the right we see the citadel (2) of Spandau, an important fortress building of the High Renaissance. We cross the Havel again, first turning right and then left behind the Haselhorst stadium. Immediately afterwards we turn in an easterly direction and turn left at the canal. At the next bridge we cross the waterway and turn right around the Saat-Winkel allotment. Soon we reach the Tegeler See lake. The well-maintained lakeside path is wonderful to cycle along and there are always small islands to be discovered in the lake. We continue over a bridge and immediately turn left onto the path parallel to Borsigdamm. On the next bridge we see the Borsig harbour and the Borsig works (3) on the right. Now we follow the Greenwichpromenade northwards across the Sechserbrücke (4). Turning left behind it, we reach the bank of the Grosse Malche and continue to the intersecting asphalt road - here we turn left. We glide effortlessly along the flat stretch through the forest and pass an open-air swimming pool. In Tegelort we also keep close to the bank and take the ferry (5) across the Havel. We ride to the end of the Fährstra;e, turn left and turn left again in front of the football pitch. In Hakenfelde we briefly follow the tracks to the south and cross them to the right at the large crossing. The next junction takes us left onto Schönwalder Strasse. We follow this straight ahead to Neuendorfer Stra&szlig and turn right. We already know the rest of the route from the outward journey and can either choose the direct route to the underground station Rathaus Spandau or a short stroll through the old town of Spandau."
