        "text": "Experience Berlin the easy way with the new Berlin WelcomeCard all inclusive. You can also book tickets for a lot of interesting attractions around Berlin.\n\nWhatever you're planning to do in Berlin, the Berlin WelcomeCard all inclusive is your official City Pass. Admission for many famous museums and top sights is already being paid for; also you get many discounts on various events and restaurants. You can also book your tickets for over 50 attractions, for example Aqua Dom and Sea Life.\n\nBook your card and tickets here!\n\nBuilt between 1788 and 1791, Berlin's most recognisable symbol has witnessed all the key events of Germany's tumultuous history. Perhaps today its most vivid association is with the country's recent reunification. An absolute must-see.\n\nIf you're visiting Berlin for the first time, a walk through the venerable Brandenburg Gate is a rite of passage. Originally built at the behest of King Friedrich Wilhelm II, the structure forms the dramatic endpoint to the showcase boulevard Unter den Linden. The legendary Hotel Adlon and the US embassy are situated along its route, and the Reichstag is just a few minutes' walk away.\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate was so badly damaged during the Second World War that it had to be replaced by a copy. Today you can visit its tranquil Raum der Stille, or Room of Silence, which is situated in one of the side wings. It's the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nVisit website\n\nThe Federal Chancellery is located at the heart of Berlin-Mitte, and is not only the supreme centre of power in Germany but is also an impressive architectural highlight of post-modernism.\n\nThe building ensemble by the architects Axel Schultes and Charlotte Franz was designed during Helmut Kohl's time, and was completed after a construction period of four years. The site measures a total of 73,000 square metres in size. It houses many works of art of classical modernism, including an iron sculpture by the Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida. Incidentally, the construction of the building cost in the region of 465 million euros.\n\nvisit website\n\nThe air of Berlin's history blows here: this historic square is often referred to as the most beautiful one in Berlin. But why not come and check it out for yourself? You won't regret it!\n\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is located in the suburb of Friedrichsstadt. It was created in 1688 to plans by Johann Arnold Nering. Frederick the Great was responsible for its current appearance. He also had the stables demolished that originally surrounded the square. The Gendarmenmarkt is bordered by the Deutscher Dom, the German Church, to the south, and the Französischer Dom, the French Church, to the north.\n\nThe Hackesche Höfe are located in the suburb of Spandau, and have been under monumental protection since 1972. Stroll through its winding courtyards, take a seat in one of the many quaint pubs or explore the small but very special shops and exclusive studios.\n\nThose who enter the Hackesche Höfe can still feel it today: the spirit of the turn of the century. And it's no wonder: the complex of buildings was opened in 1906. The eight courtyards on a total of 27,000 square metres are home to 40 commercial enterprises and many cultural institutions, including a cinema and the Varieté Chamäleon. With the architectural mix of Art Nouveau and historicism, the Hackesche Höfe are a very special highlight on a sightseeing trip.\n\nvisit website\n\nThe memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe is located near the Brandenburg Gate. Impressive and at the same time frightening, it is a reminder of Adolf Hitler's reign of terror.\n\nThe memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe was designed by Peter Eisenmann. Walk across the 19,000 square metres of the area with its grey concrete blocks, or stelae, and you will inevitably be gripped by the narrowness that makes the horrors of National Socialism understandable and at the same time sensitively recalls this dark chapter in Germany's history.\n\nvisit website\n\nSophisticated and elegant: this is what this renowned luxury department store is known for by its customers and those who want to join them. From elegant wristwatches and exquisite perfumes to the finest culinary delights, it has absolutely everything that is sure to make life lovelier.\n\nThe luxury department store opened in 1907. It was rebuilt after WWII to the original building plans. Further conversions and additions followed. Today, in addition to world-famous designer goods, it also has a huge food hall on the eighth floor. Around 500 people are employed there alone. One hundred and ten chefs, 40 confectioners and lots of chocolatiers are looking forward to your visit. And incidentally: measuring a total of 7,000 square metres, the food hall of the KaDeWe is the biggest one in Europe.\n\nvisit website\n\nThe Museum Island is situated right in the historic centre of Berlin, and is extremely popular with tourists. Its five museums house archaeological collections and art of the 19th century.\n\nNot far from our hotel, on the northern tip of the Spree island, beats the pulsating heart of Berlin's museum landscape. The Museum Island is home to five museums, including the \"Altes Museum\" (Old Museum) with an extensive collection of antiquities, and the \"Neues Museum\" (New Museum) which is home to the Egyptian Museum. Do call in and have a look; admire the famous bust of Queen Nefertiti, and embark on an exciting journey of discovery into the land of the ancient Pharaohs. Then you'll come to the \"Alte Nationalgalerie\" (Old National Gallery) with sculptures and paintings and – last but not least – the \"Bode Museum\". Incidentally, the Museum Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Pergamon Museum is currently closed due to extensive renovation (duration: until 2027).\n\nvisit website\n\nBerlin's new centre. Innovative and lively, the Potsdamer Platz, between the districts of Tiergarten and Mitte, has long been the German capital's place-to-be – with restaurants, cinemas, shopping opportunities and much more.\n\nOnce the busiest transport hub in Berlin, today a vibrant lifestyle centre with an entertainment factor: that's the Potsdamer Platz. Be amazed by the gigantic, free-floating roof of the Sony Center, which offers plenty of space for art and culture, shop under the arcades or ride the fastest elevator in Europe – just 20 seconds to travel 100 metres – up to the 24th floor of the Kollhoff Tower Berlin at Potsdamer Platz 1. From here there are breathtaking views of the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag and the Memorial Church.\n\nYou will literally see red here, because the historic building owes its name to its red clinker façade. The Rotes Rathaus – the Red Town Hall – was built between 1881 and 1898.\n\nThe most striking landmark of the Rotes Rathaus is probably is 27-metre-high tower. It was built by the Royal Building Councillor Herrmann Friedrich Waesemann, whose design was favoured over those by many of his renowned competitors. The Rotes Rathaus was heavily damaged by bombing in WWII and rebuilt to the original plans by architect Fritz Meinhard. The reception halls are particularly worth seeing, especially the impressive entrance hall and the ballroom. The Rotes Rathaus is the seat of the governing mayor and the Senate of Berlin.\n\nvisit website\n\nThe Schäfersee is a ten-minute walk from our hotel. This circular lake spans 4.5 hectares and is right beside a historical park.\n\nThe name of the Schäfersee is the only indication of the sheep farm which was once here. There is a lovely path around the lake as well as a children's playground, boat hire and a crazy golf course. The lake was created between 1922 and 1928. It is maximum seven metres deep.\n\nvisit website\n\nThe name of the palace – \"without concerns\" – describes how Frederick the Great, the man who had it built, felt about it. Its beautiful location, the famous vineyard terraces and the elegant rooms still bear witness today to the splendour and glory of days gone by.\n\nSanssouci is without doubt one of the most famous of the Hohenzollern palaces. It is situated in Potsdam, the capital of the federal state of Brandenburg. Frederick II had the Rococo-style castle built as his summer residence. It has been a World Heritage site under the protection of UNESCO since 1990. The palace also has wonderful, uniquely landscaped gardens where various events regularly take place. We will be pleased to provide you with further information.\n\nvisit website\n\nLake Tegel is located in Reinickendorf, about 8 kilometres from our hotel. With an area of 450 hectares, it is the second largest lake in Berlin after the Müggelsee.\n\nLake Tegel is actually connected to the navigable River Havel. There are seven islands in the lake, two of which are inhabited. On the northwest shore of Lake Tegel, in Tegel Forest, is the Lake Tegel outdoor pool. A number of sightseeing boats also sail the lake. We recommend a \"steamer ride\", especially in the summer months. The entire area has numerous leisure and gastronomic offers.\n\nLake Tegel is 4.2 kilometres long, 1.6 kilometres wide and a maximum of 15.93 metres deep.\n\nvisit website\n\nPack your swimmers, because Berlin has become a real water city with a wide range of water sports on offer. Lake Wannsee is one of Berlin's best-known lakes, and is the perfect spot for some activity or relaxation.\n\nThe Großer Wannsee (Greater Wannsee) is in the Berlin suburb of the same name. As well as sailing and rowing, it is also perfect for windsurfing. Incidentally, it has a maximum depth of nine metres. The Wannsee lido is listed, and is considered one of Europe's greatest inland water pools. For those who prefer it, a boat trip is ideal for sightseeing: see and admire sights such as the magnificent waterfront villas, the home of the Wannsee Conference and the church of Ss. Peter and Paul on the Nikolskoe.\n\nvisit website"
