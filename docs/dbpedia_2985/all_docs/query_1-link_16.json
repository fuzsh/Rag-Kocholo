        "text": "BERLIN TEGEL\n\n… is located on the banks of Lake Tegel and is the perfect base for river cruise boats. Guest facilities include a newly constructed landing stage surrounded by a beautifully maintained, 4.5 ha park in the Alt-Tegel district of north Berlin. The attractively designed Greenwichpromenade was comprehensively modernised by the district in 2009 and is now one of the most beautiful parts of Berlin’s waterways. The promenade is named after the London borough that is twinned with Reinickendorf and has a strong nautical feel. This is the traditional point where many passenger boats set off on their trips. The park is popular with both pedestrians and people on excursions and, as well as a tourist information system for guests as they arrive, it also boasts excellent shopping facilities just a short walk away. Whether you are setting off, stopping over or finishing here on a river cruise, you can look forward to perfect infrastructure and an attractive, welcoming atmosphere that combines a lively metropolis with tranquil natural surroundings. The excellent transport links and proximity to the tourist highlights in Berlin itself are just two of the advantages of the Greenwichpromenade and Lake Tegel location."
