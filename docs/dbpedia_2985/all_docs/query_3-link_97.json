        "text": "Summertime and the livin is easy\n\nThe great Ella Fitzgerald famously sang: “Summertime and the livin is easy. One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing. And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky. But till that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you.” She could not be more right, because in summertime everything seems to be right. I am a person who is in unconditional love with summer. I am also a person who believes than one is as rich as the number of stamps on their passport. That is why I was slightly disappointed not to go to a distant, beach destination this summer. Indeed, summer in Brussels is always beautiful. However, one of my, by far, the best weekends this summer was spent in the nearby country. Now, you would wonder how Berlin could contribute to my constant craving for beach, sand, sun and crystal clear water. Well then, listen to 1968 Ella Fitzgerald’s song below, put the volume up and join me at the most amazing Saturday at the Wannsee lake of Berlin.\n\nBefore I came to Berlin for the very first time a few weekends ago, I did not know many things about this glorious city, as there is always something new to discover. One of the most surprising things, I have witnessed there, was the incredible amount of the nirvana-like spots and lakes in the city. As the asphalt was heating up while the temperature was rising, Saturday at Wannsee lake seemed to be the most logical step. Swimming outfits and a packed bag was all we needed for the day. This paradise on Earth is located in southwestern Berlin and about 25 kilometers from the city centre, which, believe me, definitely implies quite an adventurous trip. After two train rides, one Soviet double bus with extremely friendly locals, the most beautiful two minute boat ride, several liters of water that got warmed up after a while and few Bounty chocolates, we were finally and impatiently approaching the location. I felt as if I could just look at the crystal clear water of Wannsee lake of Berlin for the whole time and feel genuinely happy.\n\nThe moment we arrived there I really felt as if we went to a hidden paradise on Earth, with only 2.7 km2 of surface. Once we stepped out of the boat, we witnessed a majestic view of this spot that seems to be a favorite place for the easy summertime livin of the Western Europe. The abundance of people lying on the grass, enjoying in the electronic music, beach volleyball and soccer along with the most beautiful nature and sun really gives a unique impression to the Wannsee lake of Berlin.\n\nNot long after, we decided to dip into the magnificent water of the Wannsee lake. Many people were jumping off the deck right into the water and having a blast, while I was sitting on the edge for a while. Encouraged by my companion and the people around me, I have decided to simply jump into the water, and oh boy, that was the best decision I could have made that weekend. My fear that the water might be too freezing was gone the moment I started swimming and enjoying myself in the crystal clear water of the Wannsee lake. Trust me when I tell you that you will not want to get out of it.\n\nLaying in the sun, swimming and a few strolls around the Wannsee lake required finding some food and refreshment. The outdoor barbecue with an array of options will definitely be worth your time waiting in the line. Maybe because of the overall atmosphere and company, but I have to admit that that was the best barbecue I have ever tried, and I come from a country where we worship meat and have a strong culture of pljeskavica and cevapi. You will know when you try it. Just a small tip – stay in your swimwear while eating it, because the portions of pljeskavica are quite big and you may get a bit messy while eating it (speaking from the experience).\n\nFinally, after a tremendous meal and a walk in the quest for some sunshine, we encountered the actual sofa, overlooking the most glorious view of the lake and the nature around it. Indeed, no matter how strange it may sound, but an actual sofa is something that definitely improved the overall visit and the Saturday at Wannsee lake. There is no amount of rain that followed afterwards or anything really that could ruin the experience of sitting on the most comfortable sofa, with the great company and simply enjoying the view of the lake. Because in summertime, the livin is easy."
