        "text": "When the temperatures rise, do what the locals do and head to a lake! There are so many great lakes in Berlin, but these are the best for swimming.Â Â\n\nWith around 3,000 lakes in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg, the trouble isnât finding a place to swim â itâs figuring out which Berlin lake is the best!Â\n\nAsk any Berliner where they like to cool off lakeside in the summer, and each person will have their own favorite place. Consider this guide merely a jumping off point for discovering your favorite swim spots!\n\nA few general tips before we dive into Berlinâs best lakes: 1) most of the lakes are surrounded by lush forests, so donât expect pristine white sand beaches when you get there; 2) signposted FKK (Freie KÃ¶rper Kultur) or nudist areas are common, so just roll with it and know that swimming in the buff is very common in this part of Germany!\n\nWhether youâre planning a trip to Berlin or you live here too, take advantage of the sunshine and get to a lake this summer!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClick âshowâ to see the full table of contents for this post. You can jump around the post as desired by clicking on the individual sections listed below.Â\n\nSchlachtensee in Steglitz-Zehlendorf\n\nIdeal for: First time lake-goers\n\nTucked away in a pretty bit of forest, Schlachtensee is the easiest lake to reach via public transportation. As such, the good swim spots along the banks of the lake fill up quickly so youâll want to arrive no later than mid-morning.\n\nLocal security has been stricter in recent years about where you can lay out around Schlachtensee, so securing a shaded spot away from the main walking path is key to lake-day success!\n\nGetting to this lake is as simple as taking the S1 to the Schlachtensee stop, walking off the subway platform, and voila! Youâre there.Â\n\nI suggest packing food and drinks for your day at Schlachtensee, but you can also purchase food at the âFischerhÃ¼tte am Schlachtensee.â\n\nGetting there: S1 to âSchlachtenseeâÂ\n\nKrumme Lanke in Steglitz-Zehlendorf\n\nIdeal for: A cooling dip after a long jog or walk\n\nRight next to Schlachtensee, youâll find the equally picturesque Krumme Lanke. This is normally my âbackup lakeâ if the good spots at Schlachtensee are all full.Â\n\nWith that being said, Krumme Lanke is a very popular swimming lake in Berlin and it can be very crowded on weekends.\n\nKrumme Lanke is especially great for long walks since a well-maintained walking path surrounds the water. In the summer, you can cool off after your walk or jog by jumping in the lake. This is also a good spot to remember in the autumn and winter when youâre craving some outdoor time.\n\nGetting there: U3 to âKrumme Lanke,â then walk 15 minutes\n\nTegeler See in Tegel\n\nIdeal for: Summer picnics and weeknight swimsÂ\n\nAs the second largest lake in Berlin, Lake Tegel has lots of great swim spots.Â\n\nThe Strandbad is the best known â and therefore busiest â place to swim, but Iâm partial to the Badestelle Reiswerder on the opposite side of the lake. Itâs a calmer spot that attracts lots of families, but itâs just popular enough to induce an ice cream truck to show up periodically on hot summer days.Â\n\nMy top tip for finding good swim spots off the beaten path is to pull up Maps and look for âBadestellen.â Those are all swim spots! Tegel Lake has clear, deep water and is a favorite lake of mine for proper swimming.Â\n\nFor lakeside vibes minus the swimming, head to the Greenwich Promenade near Alt Tegel (Old Tegel). Itâs a lovely place to walk around, eat, read, and there are also pedal boat rentals should you want to go out on the water.Â\n\nGetting there: Bus 133 to âWeg nach Reiswerderâ (for Badestelle Reiswerder â my favorite spot) or U6 to âAlt-Tegel,â then bus 222 to âStrandbad Tegeler Seeâ\n\nGrunewaldsee in Grunewald\n\nIdeal for: Dog owners who need to cool off\n\nThe Grunewald Lake in the heart of the Grunewald forest has one of the few dog-friendly beaches in Berlin. I donât have a dog, but I still love coming here to swim on muggy evenings (I just stay somewhat removed from the pups since they like to splash and play in the water).Â\n\nThe water near the dog beach is shallower, so this is a good place for gentle wading versus treading water or swimming.Â\n\nThe beach is close to the historic Grunewald hunting lodge, which has a small cafe inside that operates Tuesday through Sunday until 6pm. Packing your own picnic is still recommended, but if you run out of water or need a light snack the cafe is handy to have nearby.\n\nGetting there: Bus X10 to âBrÃ¼cke-Museum/Kunsthaus Dahlem,â then walk for 20 minutes to the âHundestrandâ\n\nGroÃer MÃ¼ggelsee in Treptow-KÃ¶penick\n\nIdeal for: Weekend swimming and boatingÂ\n\nThe MÃ¼ggelsee is Berlinâs largest lake, so if youâve been dying to get your pool floaties out of storage, this is the best lake to bring them to.Â\n\nIf water sports are your thing, look for kayak and stand up paddle board rentals around the MÃ¼ggelsee. Boat rentals are also available, but youâll want to book them far in advance when planning a lake day with friends.\n\nThe main beach is the Strandbad MÃ¼ggelsee, and as you can imagine itâs very crowded on weekends. However, if you have a blow-up boat or pool floaties, I suggest sealing your personal items in a watertight bag before paddling farther out onto the water to escape the crowds.\n\nGetting there: S3 to âFriedrichshagen,â then take tram 61 to âStrandbad MÃ¼ggelseeâ\n\nHalensee in Charlottenburg\n\nIdeal for: Quick dips after work\n\nWhen the temperatures skyrocket and you need to cool off now, head to Halensee in the heart of Charlottenburg. Thereâs just one good place to enter the water, located within Friedenthalpark (itâs very easy to find, just look for the sunbathers!).Â\n\nHalensee is a watery oasis within the city; youâll hear cars driving past on the roads nearby, but the water is clean and cool.Â\n\nIf you own water shoes, I suggest bringing them with you to Halensee since reaching the deeper swim areas requires walking over large rocks. Bring a towel as well since thereâs no beach here, just grassy parkland.\n\nGetting there: S41 / S42 to âHalensee,â then walk 15 minutes\n\nGroÃer Wannsee in Steglitz-Zehlendorf\n\nIdeal for: Beach puristsÂ\n\nNo list of Berlinâs best lakes would be complete without mentioning GroÃer Wannsee!\n\nIf you just have to swim at a proper beach, Strandbad Wannseeâs kilometer of pristine white sand is calling your name. This is a super popular spot, and on weekends itâs not unusual to see a long line of beach-goers snaking out of the entrance.Â\n\nI suggest booking your entry ticket in advance (costs 5.50 Euros) or arriving very early in the day to secure a spot along the beach.\n\nAt the Strandbad, you can rent beach baskets like you see along the coast of the Baltic Sea in northern Germany. The baskets arenât just super cute to look at, theyâre practical too! You can sit in them to get a bit of shade, and the baskets can be locked up to protect your stuff while youâre in the water.\n\nWith all that being said, if you donât want to pay to enter the Strandbad, I actually love to swim at a hidden spot along the Uferpromenade near the ferry to the Pfaueninsel (Peacock Island); photos shown above. But there are lots of places to enter the water so ask around or look on Maps to see where people have marked swimming spots.Â Â\n\nGetting there: S7 to âNikolassee,â then walk 15 minutes\n\nBonus: Kayaking in âLittle Veniceâ + Swimming in the Havel\n\nI know this is a guide to the best lakes in Berlin, but I had to give a shoutout to one of Berlinâs hidden gems.\n\nA lesser-known place in Spandau is âLittle Veniceâ (Klein Venedig). Here youâll find a series of interconnected canals that wind through private garden plots.Â\n\nThere are a few places you can rent kayaks and stand up paddle boards. Explore Little Venice, then head to the open water and paddle in the direction of Wannsee. The river banks are peppered with small beaches perfect for laying out all afternoon and swimming!Â\n\nEnjoy Your Day at the Lake!\n\nNow that you know the best lakes for swimming in Berlin, itâs time to pack up your picnic and head out the door! If you have any questions about Berlinâs lakes or if you have a favorite spot I didnât mention in this guide, please leave me a comment below.\n\nDonât forget to follow me onÂ InstagramÂ to keep up with my daily adventures in Berlin and beyond!\n\nMore Fun Things to Do in Berlin This Summer:"
