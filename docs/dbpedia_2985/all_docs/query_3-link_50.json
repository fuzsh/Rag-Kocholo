        "text": "It’s vacation season. While travel restrictions remain for many destinations outside Europe, and the restarting business world keeps us from long holidays, Berlin and its surrounding federal state of Brandenburg offer many places to enjoy the sun. Whether you want to recharge after a long day at work or plan a weekend getaway with your family, we present you nine amazing lakes, their culinary highlights, sporting recommendations, and insider tips to truly cherish the summer.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWannsee\n\nThe Wannsee is the most famous lake in Berlin and known far beyond the realms of the city for example for the Haus der Wannsee Conference. Close by is also the Glienicker Brücke - known as the Bridge of Spies - where spies were exchanged during the Cold War. If you are not in the mood for a history lesson, on the south-east banks, the Strandbad comes close to a tropical sandy beach. As this place tends to get busy on the weekend, renting a private boat from one of the many places around the lake can be a more exclusive and private opportunity. If you want to do so more regularly, Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee is the second oldest sailing club in Germany and a welcoming society with many events and sporting opportunities.\n\nVerein Seglerhaus am Wannsee e.V.\n\nAm Großen Wannsee 22-26, 14109 Berlin\n\nwww.vsaw.de\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHaus Sanssouci\n\nCulinary-wise, the Haus Sanssouci is the address for seasonal dishes, and their current speciality is a phenomenal asparagusgirolle fish.\n\nHaus Sanssouci\n\nAm Großen Wannsee 60, 14109 Berlin\n\nTel.: 030 8053034\n\nOpening Hours: Wednesday – Sunday, from 12 pm\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKrumme Lanke / Schlachtensee\n\nKrumme Lanke and Schlachtensee are two lakes in the southwestern district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf. They are only a 20- 30 minutes drive away from the city centre and offer great water quality and relaxation within the dense green forest of the Grunewald. Despite the popularity both lakes enjoy, their vegetated banks provide shade and privacy. Located between both lakes, the Fischerhütte, which is a heritage protected historical guest house and beer garden, is not only famous for a great wine selection but also for its sun terrace and cozy bar.\n\nFischerhüttenstraße 136, 14163 Berlin\n\nTel.: 030 36752634\n\nOpening Hours: Daily from 10 am – late\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMüggelsee\n\nWith 7,4 km2 the Müggelsee is the largest lake within the city of Berlin. It is around a 30 min drive south-east from the city centre in the district of Treptow-Köpenick and charms with its small and quiet coves. The lake is particularly popular for water sports such as surfing or stand up paddle boarding. Several schools offer courses for children as well as adults and rent out surf and paddle boards.\n\nSurf und Segelschule Müggelsee\n\nFürstenwalder Damm 838, 12589 Berlin\n\nOpening Hours: Hours: Daily 10 am to 8 pm\n\nhttps://www.surf-und-segelschule-mueggelsee.de\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTegeler See\n\nIn Berlin’s north and more specifically the borough of Rheinickendorf, you can find the Tegeler See. This is Berlin’s second largest lake with a surface area of 4.6 square-kilometres. Undoubtedly, it is also one of the prettiest as its water is not only incredibly clear but there are also seven islands to discover and to admire on a relaxing walk on the riverbanks. The lake is also particularly popular with swans who you can encounter on a boat ride - but don’t get too close.\n\nFischerhüttenstraße 136, 14163 Berlin\n\nTel.: 030 36752634\n\nOpening Hours: Daily from 10 am – late\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nScharmützelsee\n\nScharmützelsee is located between Frankfurt an der Oder and Berlin, south of Fürstenwalde/Spree in Brandenburg. From the city centre it is about a 60 kilometre drive away into the south-east direction, but the journey is worth it. With its wide range of recreational opportunities from surfing and kiting, to sailing and diving, to fishing and swimming, Scharmützelsee is one of the most highly regarded bathing lakes and excursion destinations in the Berlin-Brandenburg region.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRheinsberg Palace at Grienericksee\n\nIf you are looking for a weekend getaway with your family or your partner and want to discover a traditional German town, Rheinsberg is for you. Rheinsberg is located one and a half hour drive north-west of Berlin. Set on the banks of the Grienericksee, this cute cobbled-street town has a lot to offer. Enjoy a tour of the Rheinsberg Palace built in typical Rococo architecture, stroll along the colourful lines of historic houses or treat yourself to an ice cream at the Eiskönig Rheinsberg (Königstraße 28). Here, the interplay of water and architecture, nature and culture is truly remarkable. From June to August each year, the Rheinsberg Palace Chamber Opera presents a diverse program of opera and concerts, performed by young singers from all over the world in the atmosphere of the Palace.\n\nRheinsberg Palace\n\nSchloss Rheinsberg 2, 16831 Rheinsberg\n\nOpening Hours: Tuesday – Sunday: 10 am – 17:30 pm.\n\nConcert Tickets: Kammeroper Schloss Rheinsberg\n\nhttps://kammeroper-schloss-rheinsberg.de\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiepnitzsee\n\nThe Liepnitzsee looks like it has sprung out of a fairytale. While it is located around 35 kilometres north of Berlin, with its turquoise water it is one of the most beautiful lakes around the city. A charming island called Grosser Werder is sitting in the middle of the lake and you can take a ferry to access it or just swim the 300 metres across. Walking or biking around the lake is another option to take in the unique and pristine nature. There are more lakes close by such as Wandlitzsee or Stolzenhagener See which are also of high quality. Between Liepnitzsee and Wandlitzsee you can enjoy phenomenal cake and icecream at Kaffee Kätzchen, a very cute coffee house that rounds off a dreamful trip.\n\nKaffee Kätzchen\n\nPrenzlauer Chaussee 153, 16348 Wandlitz\n\nTel.: 0174 2143573\n\nOpening Hours: Daily 12pm – 6pm\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nNeuruppin\n\nThe Ruppiner See is a 14 kilometres long lake in the northwest of Brandenburg, around a one hour drive away from the capital city. The town of Neuruppin is based on the banks of the lake and walking through its old centre is like travelling in time. The wide streets are lined with grande historical buildings, which are relics of the impressive Prussian architecture. Neuruppin is also famous as the birth city of the poet Theodor Fontane, who you will encounter throughout the whole city (https://www.museum-neuruppin.de). Sitting right on the banks of the Ruppiner See is the Fontane Therme, a luxurious thermal bath where you can relax and enjoy their mineral spa, including eight themed saunas. While a day trip will certainly be recharging, you can also stay at the Resort Mark Brandenburg which is attached to the Therme. Their three restaurants and lounge set regionalism as their top priority so all meals are produced in balance with nature and many rooms offer a breathtaking view of the lake.Resort Mark Brandenburg\n\nAn der Seepromenade 20, 16816 Neuruppin\n\nOpening Hours of the Fontane Therme Spa: daily from noon to 10 pm\n\nSeewirtschaft Restaurant: Friday to Sunday, from 12pm\n\nwww.resort-mark-brandenburg.de\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSenftenberger See\n\nThe Senftenberger See is a two hour drive south-east from the city and therefore more suitable for a weekend trip. Here, the water is of such high quality and so clear that you can see up to five metres deep, making it a popular destination for many water sports such as diving, fishing and boating. The maritime town of Senftenberg is very family friendly as it also features a zoo (Tierpark Senftenberg, Steindamm 24, www.tierpark. wbs-senftenberg.de). To fully indulge in a recharging experience, the Wellnesshotel Seeschlösschen offers an indoor and outdoor spa area and premium ayurvedic treatments.\n\nBuchwalder Str. 77, 01968 Senftenberg\n\nwww.ayurveda-seeschloesschen.de\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________"
