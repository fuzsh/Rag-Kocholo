        "text": "Greenwichpromenade am Tegeler See is walkway along the shore of Lake Tegel. Due to a feeding station, some birds can be observed very closely here. Although feeding is officially undesirable, it is still practiced and is probably not a major problem given the size of the water body and other nutrient inputs. Other animals that cannot be fed also use the jetties to rest, including gulls and Great Cormorant. (Color)rings can also be read well here, even if this has rarely been recorded so far. From the Greenwich Promenade you can also look out over Lake Tegel and watch the waterfowl there. The promenade invites you to stroll. Therefore a good place to combine bird watching and family."
