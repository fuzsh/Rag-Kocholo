As your little ones grow, they take more risks — which can mean more unexpected injures. When cuts, breaks, falls and other potentially serious conditions occur, emergency care is ready for you.

If your child needs immediate medical attention for an injury or illness, we’re prepared to help your family find calm, comfort and relief. At AdventHealth Lake Wales, we understand how overwhelming (and downright scary) a trip to the hospital can be for kids. That’s why we do more than help heal what hurts. Our team knows how to help kids feel safe and supported.

And since going to the ER can be nerve-wracking for parents too, our team of specially trained emergency staff is here to serve your family with all the information, resources and guidance you need.
