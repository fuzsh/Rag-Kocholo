        "text": "With the countryside just around the corner, nature permeates the design. Nordic timber and natural concrete frame the interior, while larch timber panels form the façade. Lindesberg comprises two facilities – a residential building and the healthcare center. These buildings are connected through a common glass gallery and a green roof.\n\nThe homes are not primarily designed as care apartments, but it is possible to use them for that purpose thanks to generous dimensions, few corners, double doors and sliding doors and spacious bathrooms for possible staff.\n\nThe two facilities, the residential building and the healthcare center, are separated into two buildings linked together through the common glass gallery and the green roof. The intention is to offer accommodation with a connection to a protected park and security both inside and outside the house. The Gallery of the Senses and the park have been important ingredients in the design concept.\n\nThe main entrance to housings, healthcare center and the other premises takes place from inside the gallery. The high space with glass roof made of wooden construction is the heart of the building. It is a living room for all residents and visitors. The gallery gives access to two stairwells that lead to the apartments via three attic corridors. The attic corridors are extra wide and have parts of glass floors to guarantee daylight in the apartments.\n\nThe building is nature-oriented thanks to the surrounding nature, but the central location in the city gives the health center an urbanity in connection with the expansion of central Lindesberg. A consistent design with association to nature permeates. Nordic timber and natural concrete in the frame characterize the interior, while a larch timber panels forms the façade.\n\nThe scheme aims to provide as protected and sustainable environment as possible based on the factors influencing the environment. Noise from the railway and latitude orientation are taken care of in the design."
