        "text": "Presented by SSA Public Relations\n\nA Real-Life Fairy Tale: Princess Diana Is the first book in an illustrated biography series chronicling the lives of globally renowned women whose dedication to improving lives impacted the world. It’s the second appearance on LAParent.com for children’s author Emberli Pridham, whose first book series – If Not You, Then Who? – was profiled earlier in the year. Now a nationwide best-selling series, Pridham’s If Not You, Then Who? books introduce children to the world of inventors and invention, and spark their creativity and imagination along the way. This time, we spotlight her newest book series, Real-Life Fairy Tales and the series’ first release, A Real-Life Fairy Tale: Princess Diana.\n\nWith A Real-Life Fairy Tale: Princess Diana, Pridham takes children through the growing years of the beloved Princess of Wales, from her youth as a spunky girl in Norfolk, England, to her courtship by Queen Elizabeth’s son, Prince Charles, and her emergence as one of contemporary history’s most accomplished fighters for social change.\n\nA mother of three, Pridham developed the idea for the book series during a book reading session with daughter Brooke. The result is an inspiring and thought-provoking beautifully illustrated picture book chronicling the life and global impact of the woman many referred to as the People’s Princess. “I want to introduce this extraordinary woman to today’s generation of kids as an individual who exemplified grace and caring. Princess Diana demonstrated how one person can make a difference,” said the author.\n\nPridham is currently writing the next books about inspiring and influential people for her Real-Life Fairy Tale series, including Princess Grace and Jackie Kennedy.\n\nOriginally from Dallas, Texas, Pridham was first inspired to write by her author grandmother. Along with her husband David, Emberli co-authors the Amazon best-selling STEM book series, ‘If Not You, Then Who?’, which teaches children about the inventions and patents in everyday life, inspiring and empowering them to imagine and create their own. She also spends her time taking care of her family and is extensively involved in philanthropic work on behalf of the Hasbro Children’s Hospital, Elton John AIDS Foundation and American Cancer Society, among other charities.\n\nA Real-Life Fairy Tale: Princess Diana will be available on Barnes&Noble.com, Amazon.com and through other online booksellers, as well as at select booksellers and retailers nationwide. The book can also be purchased from its dedicated website, www.Areallifefairytale.com. 10% of the proceeds from the sale of this book will benefit Centrepoint, a UK organization that was important to the late-Princess of Wales.\n\nMultiple states have voted against it. Conservative politicians vociferously rail against it. Alarmed parents protest it, and children are caught in the middle of it. But what is critical race theory, or CRT?\n\nThese three words form the basis for a horribly misunderstood framework for legal analysis. The core idea is that race is a social construct and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice but also something embedded in legal systems and policies. Though four decades old, CRT expanded beyond legal circles after the murder of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nTwin pandemics, COVID-19 and racial tensions, were in full swing, and many believed this was an actual chance for racial atonement and progress. One of the ways to achieve this, CRT proponents say, is through restructuring the educational curriculum at the K-12 level to include diverse experiences, cultures and identities. This needed to happen immediately, as advocates felt it was time to use our kids’ classrooms to tell the rich and ugly truth about the founding of America. But pushback ensued and demands for justice and antiracism began to abate. Arguments broke out at school board meetings, and some corporations and conservatives seized an opportunity. The real goal of CRT, they alleged, was to center white people as the root of all evil and, if CRT were allowed in the classroom, white children would be made to feel guilty for being white.\n\nThose debates have spread across the nation with multiple states banning CRT in education. In California, home to Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second largest school district in the nation, the debate over CRT rages on. Though described by LAUSD as “both an asset and research-based approach that makes meaningful connections between what students learn in their schools and their cultures, languages and life experiences,” one CRT opponent characterized it as an attempt to turn students into “social justice warriors.” And in April, the proposed adoption of culturally responsive instruction, or CRI, at Los Alamitos High School in Orange County was the subject of much debate.\n\nThe confusion over the outcome of teaching CRT is legitimate. There have been instances of overzealous people blaming individual whites for past racial iniquities and some politicians weaponizing CRT as an attempt to instill fear in white parents. Kim Bryant, mother to a third-grade Black son in L.A., says, “I think that kids need to know how different races contributed to the past, present and future. Children should not be made to feel badly about themselves because of their race, and I don’t think that’s what critical race theory does.”\n\nWhite parents should not be afraid to express their fear of change, though they should know that this fervor to protect them has been missing for Black and brown children, subjected to inaccurate and revisionist history, for generations. Many people of color were taught that their ancestors were heathens or violent.\n\nAccording to veteran educator Gregory Hooker, academic instructional coordinator for the Black Student Achievement Plan (BSAP) in LAUSD, “I’ve been in education for 28 years, and this is the first time that LAUSD has put funding in place to support our Black students.”\n\nHooker oversees five schools — one middle school and four elementary schools — that feed into Washington Preparatory High School. “Training around cultural pedagogy, cultural lessons and materials makes a big difference,” he says. “The students see themselves and respond better to culturally relevant lessons. It is an honor to be in this transition as we began to support families who live in some of our most challenging areas.”\n\nAt the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 101 in October, which requires ethnic studies to be taught in high schools. The mandate goes into effect during the 2029-30 school year, though some school districts in L.A. and Fresno have already passed similar optional requirements. Both on the local and state level, public schools in California are moving toward diversifying their education standards.\n\nI wondered if this was the same for private schools, who have more latitude when it comes to what is taught, so I contacted some private school administrators. Brad Zacuto, head of school at Westside Neighborhood School in Playa Vista, says that while the school does not teach CRT, “Our curriculum is based on true American history.\n\n“As a private institution, we are fortunate to have the opportunity, and the responsibility, to develop a curriculum that allows our students to have an accurate understanding of the past so they may create the future they want to see,” he says.\n\n“We actively work to cultivate students who will become change makers, those who will find solutions for our greatest challenges,” Zacuto says. “But we cannot be successful without using our curriculum to seek the truth, using research and documentation to discuss factual knowledge and, where and when it occurs, thoroughly examining how unfair policies, practices and laws of the past and, unfortunately, some of the present, continue to severely impact, marginalize and disadvantage groups of people.”\n\nIn my own experience as an adjunct U.S. history professor within the Los Angeles Community College system, I’m able to select textbooks and videos and create lectures that shine a light on the role of immigrants, women, indigenous, Latinx and Spanish speakers, enslaved and free Blacks and those who identify as LGBTQIA. Each group has a stake in the fate of the nation, and I would be remiss to ignore their historical and contemporary contributions.\n\nBy the end of each semester, students send emails thanking me for a balanced account of American history. They often ask why no one ever told them the truth and discuss how they may have pursued a different major or career, had they known about their ancestors’ accomplishments. My teaching is not a ploy to make my white students feel bad. It is simply my way of offering a window and a mirror to young adults so they know we are all in this together.\n\nAs noted by Rashawn Ray and Alexandra Gibbons of the Brookings Institute, those in favor of CRT believe that “white people living now have a moral responsibility to do something about how racism still impacts all of our lives today.” This provides an emphasis on action, not shame or blame. Lawmakers, and some educators, in California are forging a path forward to eliminate inaccurate historical representations in a quest to uplift everyone.\n\nNefertiti Austin is author of “Motherhood So White: A Memoir of Race, Gender and Parenting in America.” She lives with her two children in Los Angeles."
