        "text": "The construction of the Perth Children’s Hospital and Optus Stadium shifted associated uses away from Subiaco, or Subi, a suburb known for its vibrant culture. This created an exciting opportunity to redevelop the area around Subiaco Oval, Kitchener Park, and the former Princess Margaret Hospital sites. To address this change, DevelopmentWA selected us to help develop the Subi East masterplan.\n\nWe’re providing feasibility assessments including acoustics, civil engineering, transport, underground power, and sustainability design. Our water resources team played a key role by developing the Urban Water Management Plan.\n\nWe’re also assisting with the design and construction phase services of the Oval precinct. We’ve coordinated with stakeholders and authorities, completed an acoustic survey and associated modelling, contributed civil planning and infrastructure design, and aligned DevelopmentWA’s sustainability goals with an implementation strategy.\n\nThe Subi East Redevelopment will deliver a new model for Western Australia communities, exploring the opportunities for modern civic benchmarks and a diversified use of land."
