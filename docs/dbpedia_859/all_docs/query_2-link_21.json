Before the invention of the printing press books •^S** were treasured as carefullj'' as jewels and plate. Book cov- N yQ, ers, indeed, were frequently encased in solid silver and encrusted with jewels. Wonderfully different is the mod- ^^^^f^WW picture — rotary presses, wood-pulp paper, and the uni- >^r\\ versal mania for publicity, combining to gorge the waste barrels with the unwanted products of the typewriter and the press. Six hun- dred )'ears ago a great prelate who was rich enough to have collected a library of fifty volumes became an object of awe and envy. To-day, the harried apartment-dweller inheriting an average collection of five hundred books cannot give them away, nor even sell them for old paper, because in the latter case it will not pay the junkman to tear off the covers. Nevertheless, the man rich enough to have brought together a collection of fifty books is more envied than he ever was, provided he has the right fifty. In extraordinary contrast to the diminishing value of books in the bulk, so to speak, is the steadily augmenting price of book rarities. Collectors pay fabulous prices not only for mediaeval codices on illuminated vellum and bound in plate and jewels, but the cheapest and most casual products of the printing press command unbelievable sums if only they are enough sought for by collectors. It is perhaps not so extraordinary that six-penny first B P 6 : J e »7- 4500*75 1 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN editions of Shakespeare's plays — the so-called quartos — should now sell at from fourteen to twenty thousand dollars apiece. But what shall we think of dime novels printed seventy years ago and now quoted at sixty dollars or more apiece? And we are beg^ining- to hear of the rising' value of first editions of authors who are still busily producing \"copy\" for the linotypes. This is not, hoAvever, a study of bibliomania. The preceeding para- graphs may serve to throw into more vivid relief certain conditions which confront those libraries which are fortunate — unfortunate sometimes seems the more fitting word — enough to possess valuable collections of old books. Libraries, in spite of a not unnatural conservatism as appointed guard- ians of the past, have not escaped the modern trend towards specialization. Seventy years ago, outside of law and medicine, the special collection ex- isted only as the idiosyncracy of private collectors. An institutional library acquired as a matter of course everything it could get hold of. Librarians of that day, indeed, made an article of religion out of the \"sacredness of print.\" It was held that a library could not refuse anything since it was impossible to know which ephemeral pamphlet or broadside might not acquire enormous value in the eyes of posterity. To-day, on the other hand, we have all sorts of special libraries. Book rarities, when not hoarded in private collections, gravitate for the most part to special collections, commonly joined to university libraries, unless, indeed, like the Hispanic Society and Morgan Libraries in New York or the Hunt- ington Library in California, they have received independent endowment. Free public libraries in the meantime have developed on quite different lines. Financed by taxation, their sole aim has been direct service to the largest possible public. To this one great object, on which they are of course dependent for their very existence, the book collection has become wholly subservient. Free access to shelves, enlarged home-use privileges, branch deliveries, evening and Sunday opening, have all contributed to increase the wear and tear of the collections. Books — say the modern school of librarians — are made for readers, and what does it matter if they are often lost, worn out and replaced, provided mounting circulation figures show more intensive use by an ever larger public? This newer conception of libraries as centres of constantly augmenting public service is everywhere justifying itself in growing support and interest and nobody would now have it otherwise. But it has to be recognized that it creates grave difficulties for those public libraries which were built up in what we may call the storehouse period, and have assumed the obligation of holding intact for posterity important collections of increasingly valuable books. The two outstanding examples of public libraries entrusted with the care of extremely valuable special collections are those of New York and Boston. In New York the problem has been much simplified by the fact that the special collections of the Astor-Lenox-Tilden Foundations have remained the property of a corporation, independent of city control and munificently supported by private endowment. The books belonging to the united founda- 2 TREASURE ROOM tions or purchased from the endowment funds constitute a great reference library wholly withdrawn both from home circulation and inter-library loan. All persons have access to the reference library, it is true, but readers sub- mit to police surveillance and the integrity of the collections is as carefully guarded as in any other privately endowed reference library. Circulating books purchased from city appropriations are stored and issued in a specially assigned part of the building, quite distinct from the reference library. From the beginning the Boston Public Library has been under muni- cipal control, with a staff and equipment maintained by city appropriations. Its special collections, however, have been received from generous donors and have been enlarged from funds of the same origin. In accepting these books and funds the city, of course, assumed a most solemn and binding obligation to preserve for future generations the book treasures so acquired. How well has the Library fulfilled the obligations of its trust in the past, and what must be done to safeguard its treasures for the future? It is not the intention of this article to dilate upon the probable present and future value of the special collections. Many articles on these collections have already been printed in More Books and the former Bulletin. These must have given some idea of the unusual scope and value of the collections and of the extraordinary number of the rare and valuable items contained in them. Any adequate appraisal of the collections would require months of expert assistance in looking up thousands of titles in priced sale-catalogues and, even so, the estimated total would be an unreliable approximation be- cause the sale prices of rare books are incessantly climbing. Every important book sale reveals the extraordinary richness of the library's collections and the startling rise in value of individual items. It is probably not hazardous to assert that the more valuable parts of the donated collections are now from five to ten times more valuable than when they were acquired, thirty or forty years ago. In the old building on Boylston Street, the Library, as was the common practice in that day (still continued in the New York Public Library) had at first a clearly marked division between circulating and reference collections. Books in the Lower Hall circulated ; upstairs, Bates Hall housed a reference library. The constantly growing demand for home-use tended to wipe out this distinction and when the Library moved into its new quarters in Copley Square it wholly disappeared. There were no longer a circulating library and a reference library, but one great circulating library containing many books restricted to \"Hall Use.\" The necessity for safeguarding the special collections was not over- looked, however. An entire floor was assigned to them in the new building. No public library had ever before made such splendid provision for the care of its finer books. The new library had been in use but a short time, however, when the growing needs of service modified the original plan. An entire floor could not be reserved for special and wholly restricted collections. All the books in Fine Arts, Music and Technology, many classes of Government Docu- 3 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN ments, and all the maps and the oversize books of every class were also shelved on the Special Libraries floor. The special collections, nevertheless, had their particular rooms. In the main reading room assigned to them, shelves Avere protected with glass doors and in the adjoining gallery the book^ were kept in gated alcoves. Every- thing seemed to have been done that was necessary to separate them from the rest of the Library and safeguard their peculiar character as treasures and legacies for coming generations. They were segregated from the popular collections and under specially assigned custodians. Their very character as groups of old and little-read books shielded them from popular curiosity and use. Only persons really interested in rare books would ever make the long journey to the third floor to search them out. In practice the use of the Special Collections has not been just what was expected. Uuforeseen and disturbing elements have complicated the problems of adequate safeguard and supervision. Congested stacks and exhausted book appropriations not infrequent- ly tempted harassed librarians to purchase from special funds books more suitable for the main library than for these restricted groups. The chief trouble has come, perhaps, from the inclusion in the main public catalogue of every book in the special collections. A reader or student seeks the text of some standard work in Bates Hall. Every edition in the main stack is charged \"Out,\" \"In use,\" \"At the Bindery\" or otherwise unavailable. There is an edition on the Special Libraries floor which experience proves to be always available for hall use. The custodians of the special collections have done their best to resist the indiscriminate use of these books but all the reading rooms of a public library are open daily and Sunday until lo p.m. It is not always possible to have on duty someone who, in a collection of sixty thousand books, can immediately discriminate between one that is a rarity and one located there for convenience. Nor has every library assistant the flair to distinguish be- tween a bona fide research scholar and a merely curious reader looking for special privileges; nor indeed, the tact and will power to resist the insis- tence of the latter. Who or what is a library employee to refuse the just de- mands of any citizen? Is the library not a public institution and has not every citizen an equal right to the use of every book? Is it anyone's business why he wants to read the book in that particular edition? Such are the contentions which the conscientious curator must oppose. The policy of keeping general readers and undergraduate students out of the Barton-Ticknor Gallery has encountered much opposition. If a scholar gathering notes for a learned publication can enjoy almost unlimited priv- ileges there, then v/hy not a medical or law student reviewing his own lec- ture notes for an examination? The cases seem scarcely parallel, but none the less sometimes become occasions for obstinate argument. In addition to difficulties of supervision, the special collections are ex- posed to the deteriorating action of sulphur and coal dust to an extent not dreamed of by the builders of the Library in Copley Square. Boston's 4 TREASURE ROOM rare collections, on antiquated wooden shelves exposed to a soot-laden at- mosphere, create a most unfavorable impression upon anyone familiar with the treasure rooms of the newer libraries. Yet there are few collections which better deserve the protection afforded by modern dust-proof and fire-proof cases of steel and wire-glass. The present administration of the Library has, with the co-operation of specialists, planned changes in the Special Libraries floor and its equipment which, if carried out, will for a long time to come remedy most of the pres- ent shortcomings in the care of the special collections. The plan contemplates the transformation of the Music Room into a handsome Treasure Room with wall-cases for rare books and floor-case.-^ with tops for selected exhibits and cabinets for storage beneath. All this furniture is to be in steel and glass with bronze trim. The music library and its reading tables are to be transferred to the Barton or North Gallery, and shelving for this large addition to the present contents of the Gallerj-, as well as for some years of future expansion, will be provided by building on the north side of the gallery and in the north-west corner room beyond, a two-story modern steel stack in place of the present wide alcoves and wooden wall and floor cases. The plan also includes the entire refitting of the Barton-Ticknor read- nig room. On both floor and balcony the wooden wall shelves will be replaced by steel shelves protected by wire-glass doors in steel frames. All of these rooms are to be enclosed with fire-proof partitions and doors. The window^ will receive steel frames filled with wire-glass and in all respects the equip- ment w-ill comply with the most exacting requirements of modern fire-proof construction. The advantages of a well-guarded Treasure Room, having no tables for readers and closed after five o'clock and at other times when a respon- sible curator cannot be on hand, are too obvious to need any comment. In fact, this Library is almost the only great library owning a conspicuous number of book treasures, which does not now have such a room. The Trustees have asked His Honor, the Mayor, to authorize a special loan for the carrying out of the proposed plans. The sum involved is insig- nificant in comparison with the City's total budget, but it will afford for the City's incomparable special book collections the protection which the public- spirited donors expected. Small, also, is the requested sum in comparison with the present value of the collections which it will ])enefit. Every right- minded citizen, we feel sure, wishes the city to keep faith with the illustrious benefactors of the Library. He wishes, moreover, to have for the City's book treasures an installation needing no apologies, but comparing so well with similar provisions in other great libraries that it may be an object of justifi- able civic pride. WiNTHROP Holt Chenery Chief of Special Libraries Department 5 \"The A.L.A. Catalog, 1926\" Of the series of volumes published by the American Library Association as a feature of the celebration of its Fiftieth Anniversary, none are of such general interest, or likely to be so wide- ly useful, as the \"A.L.A. Catalog, 1926.\" This volume, which is the lineal de- scendant of the A.L.A. Catalogues issued successively in 1893 and 1904, with supplements in 1912 and 1923, is however, larger and more comprehen- sive than either of the earlier lists, and is the first one to be compiled by a pro- fessional staff devoting its entire atten- tion to the task. The new book is described as \"An annotated basic list of 10.000 books,\" but additional titles included in the notes bring the num.ber up to 12,000 or 13,000. Some five hundred persons co- operated in the selection of titles and the result is a triumph of comprehen- sive excellence. The Dewey decimal classification has been followed in the arrangement of the books, and a suc- cessful attempt has been made to pro- portion the material under the different headings according to its relative im- portance to the average library. Each book listed carries the number of the corresponding Library of Congress card, and a list of subject headings sufficient for ordinary cataloguing purposes. The book is provided with an admirable index, including authors, titles and subjects, which fills more than a quarter of the fat volume, and covers 368 pages of three columns each. This index is a very thorough piece of work and includes hundreds of analytical references to the contents of the works listed. The catalogue is an interesting book from cover to cover. The books select- ed include a great number of the old standard works, with suggestions re- garding the most desirable editions, ! together with the important works in i every field, chosen with astonishing i discrimination, which have appeared ! during the past ten years. The annota- tions are full and illuminating. Not one j is perfunctory, and from nearly every 1 one it is easy to form an idea of the I book described, and its desirability for ' a given purpose. The notes on reference books are searching in their attempt to discriminate honestly between the claims of rival works, i The compilation of this catalogue I is a notable service to the libraries of j the country. No criticism should be allowed to diminish the credit and grati- tude due to Miss Isabella ]\\L Cooper, ; the editor, and her corps of assistants. : If the book has a serious fault, it is the ' failure to distinguish between the date ; on the title page of the latest edition of j a book and its copyright date. In a number of cases this failure might mis- I lead one into thinking that a book with i a recent date was a recent book, while [ in fact it may not have been revised for a number of years. In many cases, j however, this fact is brought out in the note on the book. A minor fault is the { failure to print conspicuously on each j page the subdivisions of the classifica- { tion which are covered on that page ; one now has to search for the class to which the book belongs and for the I extent of a given sub-class. Even here, ' however, the subject headings printed below the description of each book are some guide to its classification. Every library in the United States should be a better library as a result of the publication of this great catalogue, j When some of the other achievements and glories of the Anniversary Year have been forgotten, this volume will remain as a monument to the vision of the American Library Association and the industr)-, scholarship, and good sense of its editors. How Old is the Wayside Inn? \"So much has been written about the j Wayside Inn, Sudbury, that most of j my readers are famihar with its general appearance,\" Elise Lathrop writes in her recently published book FavIx American Inns and Taverns. Many of her readers, however, are familiar with the house not merely from reading, but also from actual visits. And these, as well as those who have only read about the place, will be astonished to conic across this sentence in the book : ! \"The present house, with its many old fireplaces, is believed to be not older than one hundred and six! years, but an inn stood here earlier than 1820, for Sudbury is one of the oldest towns in ^lassachusetts.\" Obviously, the author has not seen the Wayside Inn — the large rambling building on the road to Worcester, with its bar room, parlor, narrow corridors and stairways, and, in the rear, the old dining-room and the rooms now asso- ciated with the names of Washington and Lafayette. No, it is manifestly impossible that this inn is not older j than one hundred and six years. One wonders, where did Miss Lath- \\ rop get her data? Had she remembered j only Longfellow's poem, she vrould ' have felt that her statement needed I some explanation. For to thousands of people these lines are dear : As ancient is this hostelry As any in the land may be, Built in the old Colonial day, When men lived in a grander way, With ampler hospitality; A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall, Now somewhat fallen to decay, With weather-stains upon the wall, And stairways w-orn, and crazy floors. And chimneys huge, and tiled and tall. , The Tales of a Wayside Inn was pub- lished in 1863, but Longfellow visited the inn as early as 1840. It is highly im- probable, to say the least, that a house built in 1820 should have impressed the poet as a kind of old Hobgoblin Hall. For accurate dates, however, a poem is not the best source of information. We need also other records, if we wish to know the year when the house was built. There is, then, over the porch the swinging sign : Half effaced by rain and shine The Red Horse prances on the sign. Around the head, hoofs and tail of the steed are painted the dates which tell of the successive owners of the tav- ern. At the top stands the figure 1683, as the year when the house was built. Next are the initials D.H. and the fig- ure 1686, showing the time when David Howe, the first owner, opened the place for wayfarers. But this information is clearly erro- neous. The sign, a copy of the original, was put up by Adam Howe in about 1800. And that 1683 could not be the year of building is evident from the fact that David Howe was then unly nine years old, having been born — as we learn from the Middlesex County Records of births, marriages and deaths — on November 2, 1674. The error crept into Samuel A. Drake's Historic Fields and Mansions, published in 1874, and since then has reappeared in many other books and magazine articles. In Drake's larger work, History of Middlesex County (1880), the mistake has been corrected. Here the Reverend George A. Oviatt, who wrote the chapter on Sudbury, states: \"This famous resting-place . . . was built and opened as a tavern in the year 1700 or 1701, by David Howe. It was first known as 'The Howe Tavern in Sudbury,' to distinguish it from the tavern of John Howe, two miles west in Marlborough. As early as 1746 Colonel Ezekiel Howe, son of David, took the 7 MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN house and put up the sign which gave it the name of the 'Red Horse Tavern,' which it continued to hold.\" The article gives also this informa- tion: \"The Wayside Inn, as a building, was small at first, from time to time additions were made to it as was need- ed, till it became a tavern of large di- mensions . . . The most important parts of the building remain in the exact style of the olden times.\" Now the question arises : at what time and in what sequence were the additions made? Looking at the house from the edge of the road, a hundred yards' distance, one is struck with the scale of the archi- tecture. The large frame-work of the central building decidedly impresses one as dating from a later period than the rooms in the rear — the Washington room and the old dining-room especial- ly— which, built in a simpler way, ap- pear to be the oldest parts of the house. One has the instinctive feeling that these rooms once belonged to the orig- inal inn and were later incorporated into the house, when this v.-as remod- elled on a larger scale. The parlor and bar room, on the other hand, seem to be integral parts of the new, large frame-work. There is no written evidence as to the dates of the successive additions, but many writers share this view. They state distinctly that the bar room, so unique in character, belongs to a later period than the Washington I'oom. In an article in the July, 1926, issue of the Garden and Home Builder — a special Wayside Inn number — Mr. Charles G. Loring suggests another chronology. After he had examined the rooms — the beams, floors, closets, etc. — using the reports which experts had drawn up for Henry Ford, and after he had gone over the building with the carpenter who had done the latest re- modelling, Mr. Loring came to the con- clusion that the bar room and the parlor constituted the original inn ; that the first additions were the Washington room, the old dining-room and the Lafayette room ; that the spacious kitchen in the rear was built at a later time, and the restaurant room still later ; ] and finally, that several important I changes have been made since the time [ when Longfellow wrote his poem. The \"plan of grounds,\" printed at the front : of his article, and illustrating the sup- posed sequence of additions, is of great interest. As to Washington's and Lafayette's ! visits at the inn, there are no historical data. Alfred S. Hudson in his Hisfory of Sudbury (1889) writes: \"That Gen- eral W^ashington stopped there is quite probable since he went from Marlboro to Boston and dined at Weston with Colonel Lamson. As the Howe Tavern would be on his direct route it would be natural for him to stop there, and. at least, take a lunch with Mr. Howe, an- other of the colonels of the Revolution.\" j Concerning Lafayette's visit we read in I the Yearbook for 1898 of the Societ}' of i Colonial Wars: \"Upstairs you are i shown the state chamber . . . where I tradition says Lafayette slept on his ! journey to Boston, in 1824.\" I Now, for completeness' sake, a few genealogical facts. Many writers on the Wayside Inn refer to David Howe, the first owner, as \"an Englishman\" who originally built for himself a mansion ! which was later, when his fortunes j became adverse, turned into a hostelry. 1 The story deserves correction. David I Howe was no Englishman, but as much of an American as anyone could be. His father, Samuel, the second son of John i and Mary How (sic), was born on Au- ! gust 20, 1642, in Sudbury, which had ■ been incorporated as a town three years I before. Samuel How married Martha Bent on June 5, 1663, and seven child- ren were born of their happy union. David Howe, our hero, was the sixth j child — and not the youngest, as Allen j H. Bent states in his paper on the Bent ; family, contributed to the New England I Historical and Genealogical Register for 1894. The Birth Records say that ' the youngest child was a girl, Hannah, I who was born on April 6, 1677. 8 Ten Books What is ail educated person like? How does he differ from the nne'Uicat- ed? Does he third< differently and, if so. why? — Such are the c|uestions which Everett Dean Martin. Director of the People's Institute in New York, discus- ses in his recent book, Tlie Meaning of a Liberal Education. And he answers that . . education is more than informa- tion, or skill, or propaganda. In each age education must take into account the conditions of that age. But the edu- cated mind is not a mere creature of its own time. Education means . . . self- mastery, capacity for self-criticism, sus- pended judgment, and urbanity.\" \"This book,\"he continues, \"contends that edu- cation is a spiritual revaluation of hu- man life. Its task is to reorient the in- dividual, to enable him to take a richer and more significant view of his exper- iences, to place him above and not with- in the system of his beliefs and ideals.\" He points out certain tendencies as dis- tinctly hostile to the work of education, such as the fondness for over-organiza- tion, the view-point of narrow utilitari- anism, the cleverness in finding short- cuts, and the tendency to make propa- ganda. \"Liberal education versus book learning,\" \"The free spirit,\" \"The appre- ciation of human worth.\" \"Education and morals,\" \"The Classical tradition,\" \"Humanism,\" \"Science and supersti- tion,\" are among the problems discuss- ed. There is a chapter on \"Adult edu- cation in America.\" Here the writer emphasizes that the methods of adult education must be different from those in common use in teaching children. His greatest fear is that the movement may become standardized after the fashion of the public school system. He believes that a high level can be kept up without resorting to a mechanical uniformity, if the movement is guided by a philoso- phy of liberal education. I Twenty-nine critical cssajs. all nf which appeared in .Xmerican periodicals in a single year, have been collected b}\" William A. Drake in a volume called I American Criticism, IQ26. \"These arc i emphatically not the best critical essays of the year,\" the editor declares ; but lie believes that \"such an arbitrary selec- tion of taste may be more reliable in the long run than a more sober considera- tion of academic merits.\" The book, at any rate, is intended for the \"common reader.\" and not so much for his edifica- tion as for his entertainment. The com- mon reader, whoever he be, may aj)- I prove of the selection, for some of these i essays are really excellent, and almost all of them are stimulating. Among the names which wc meet in the volume are those of Stuart Sherman, Henry Seidel Canby, H. L. Mencken, Carl Van Dor- en, Edgar Lee Masters, Sinclair Lewis, Agnes Repplier, Chauncey Brewster Tinker, Waldo Frank, Zona Gale, Gil- bert Seldes. The Introduction itself is a critical essay : on the state of criticism in America. Mr. Drake thinks that most of our critics — though not those whose articles he has selected — have very little \"pure scholarship.\" He also deplores the lack of \"a definite aesthetic concep- tion\" in present-day American letters. However, the undeniable native vigor j of the critical spirit makes him, at the end, more optimistic. I Biographies by Emil Ludwig read j like novels. His Napoleon is in the first I place a character study in which the j great events and movements of the rev- olutionary, post-revolutionary and Em- pire 3 ears of France are essentially a background to the self-assertion of a unique personality. The lonely, unpre- possessing, but passionately ambitious young cadet and student is already the potential conqueror: \"He draws up I specifications of all the localities in the MORE BOOKS: A BULLETIN island where he would place batteries, dig trenches, station troops — if he had but the power! Beneath the network of poetical thoughts with which he has covered the island, he spreads over his maps a second network, wherein cross- es denote big guns. Maps, maps ! At the end of the last of his copy-books, the final entry runs : 'St. Helena, a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. English colony'.\" The biographer shows Napo- leon as general, as First Consul, as \"self-crowned emperor,\" and at last in exile and defeat. The recently published Survey of Internatiomil Affairs, 1924 by Arnold J. Toynbee is characterised in the preface ns \"severely practical.\" In the stitdy of World Affairs, the author considers first \"Security and Disarmament\" — as the negotiations for an Anglo-French Pact and the Geneva protocol for the pacific settlement of international dis- putes— then traces \"The Movement of Population.\" Here he presents the United States restriction of immigra- tion acts of 1921 and 1924, the immigra- tion policy of other countries, the problem of oriental immigration, etc. There follows an exposition of \"The Third International and the Union of .Soviet Socialist Republics.\" In his more detailed treatment of Europe, the au- thor deals with such events a.s the struggle in the German occupied terri- tories from January t 923 to the time when the Dawes plan began to work, the London agreements, the reconstruc- tion of Hungary and the Polish-Czecho- slovak boundary dispute. There is a brief section on Tropical Africa. The Human Hive: Its Life and Law by A. H. Mackmurdo, the English econo- mist, in fifty-three short chapters pre- sents— not an imaginary Utopia, but a perfected commonwealth governed by ethical and social motives. Numerous diagrams show human activities in their orderly interrelations. Thus the author shows, for instance, the related influences of what he calls the five card- inal institutions: the Home, the Work- shop, the School, the State and the Church. All factors that go to the build- ing up of a civilized society are consid- ered: the. biologic equipment of the in- I dividual, the family ; then the commun- j ity, industrial association, the suggested \"occupation-guild\" ; the production of food-stuffs in its relation to population and the output of creative activity ; the true function and social value of money ; and finally the ideal, the governing and the aesthetic pursuits. H01V Natives Think by the French ethnologist Lucien Levy-Bruhl is a companion volume to \"La Mentalite Primitive\" which appeared in English in 1923. The recent book contains stud- ies of the various forms of collective representations among primitive peoples — that is, group ideas, for example of the totem, of mystical properties attrib- uted to animals, plants, inanimate j objects, of ceremonies, of spirits and death. [ Music and Music-Makers by Con- i stance Murse gives a survey of the de- velopment of music in a simple, enter- taining st3-le suited to young students and untrained music lovers. The first part of the book is historical and ex- pository, the second part biographical. The first chapter tells of Egyptian in- struments known from papyrus records, of lutes unearthed before i/oo; of the battle music of the Assyrians; of the ancient Jews' timbrels, harps and trum- pets and their antiphonal singing of psalms ; of the sacred songs of the Vedas in India, of the Chinese stone- organ. There follows a chapter on the nmsic of the Greeks, and their cult of I melody rather than harmony. A chapter on Mediaeval church music presents the contributions of St. Ambrose, uf j Gregory the Great, of Palestrina and I others, and goes beyond the Middle j Ages to include the chorales of Lu- I ther. There is a brief history of min- : strels and troubadours and of later i singers. Several chapters show the de- ' velopment of music notation and the scales, of musical forms, and finally of I certain instruments. The biographical ; part contains chapters on leading com- ! posers from Bach to Macdowell and other Americans. William Beebe, the zoologist, ex- , plorer and popular author of \"Jungle i Days,\" \"Galapagos, World's End,\" and I \"The Arcturus Adventure,\" has once 10 TEN BOOKS more brought home to the lay reader the romance and drama of animal life. The two volume work Pheasants, their Lives and Homes is written in his fam- iliar lively style. The first chapter gives a general account of the kinds, distribution, characteristics and habits of pheasants. Then follow detailed ob- servations. \"For seventeen months T travelled in Asia and the East Indies.\" says the author, \"studying the pheas- ants in their native haunts, and was fortunate enough to find and study every one of the nineteen genera of these birds which I recognize in lliis v/ork. In the eastern Himalayas, from the terai of Nepal, Sikhim, and Bhutan to the southern border of Tibet, I found the Black-backed Kaleeg\"e,thelmpeyan, the Satyr Tragopan, and, high up near the snows, the Blood Pheasants. Here I travelled on horseback and afoot and worked with the aid of sturdy Ti- betan men and women, of Bootias, and of Nepalese shepherds.\" Numerous full page illustrations show the birds in characteristic groups and attitudes v/ith their exotic landscape backgrounds. The Bridge, an essay by Christiaii Barman, written with fine ability though not without some affectation, owes its distinction largely to the illus- trations by Frank Brangwyn. \"What Rembrandt has done for human beings you have done for bridges,\" the author writes in an Epistle to the artist. Twenty-three of the illustrations are in color, while the rest are in black and white. From a note we learn that years ago Brangwyn intended to publish a monumental work which was to in- clude all the etchings which he had made of bridges; but the war i)ut an end to liis scheme. Many of the draw- ings, seventy in number, were used in // Book of Bridges, published in 1915, and others have been sold and no rec- i ord kept of them. Most of the remain- ing drawings — like those of Pont Mario and Pont Neuf in Paris, the Velvet Bridge in Durham, the Bridge of Boats and Mosque in Constantinople, of Ijridges built in many countries and in different ages — are reproduced in the present volume. Art ill Advertising, \"a study of British and American pictorial publicity,\" by Percy V. Bradshaw, discusses many problems of the practical application of art to every-day needs, especially to commerce. The writer, Director of the Press Art School in London, believes that British advertisements are far below the level oi American adver- tisements. The British advertisers, he maintains, are reluctant to employ the services of their best illustrators, where- as in America such artists receive the \\ greatest encouragement. As far back ! as thirt}' years ago, the American mag- azines gave work to men like Edwin Abbey, Howard Pyle, Joseph Pennell, Howard Chandler Christy; so one can I hardl}- regard American enterprise in 1 advertisement illustration as one of the results of post-war prosperity. The j functions of the advertiser, agent, copy- writer, artist, printer are considered in separate chapters. The volume is richly illustrated with some of the best examples of the works produced hy British and American advertising- agencies and commercial studios. 11 Synopsis of Classification Amusements.
