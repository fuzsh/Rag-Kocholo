        "text": "Swansea City is delighted to announce Noah’s Ark Children's Hospital Charity will be our charity of the season for the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nAs has been the case for a number of years, the club recently gave supporters the opportunity to nominate a charity for the club to support, and we received an overwhelming response.\n\nThe Noah’s Ark Children's Hospital Charity was initially established as an appeal in the year 2000 with one simple goal; to raise enough money to build a world class hospital for the children of Wales.\n\nFive years later that goal became a reality and the first phase of the hospital opened its doors to patients in the spring of 2005.\n\nDuring the second phase of the hospital’s creation, millions of pounds were raised to fund major projects like children’s operating theatres, an MRI scanner and the only specialist paediatric critical care unit in Wales.\n\nIn 2015, the completed hospital - by now renamed as the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales in recognition of the charity’s support - was launched.\n\nToday, the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales provides specialist and often life-saving care to around 73,000 young patients from all across Wales every year. The charity is committed to supporting these children and their families in as many ways as possible – as it has been from the very beginning.\n\nNoah’s Ark ensure that treatment and outcomes for children can continue to improve by funding new and innovative medical equipment and facilities.\n\nThey support children and families in the here and now through their emotional support service and the much-loved play specialist teams, and they invest in the future by providing technology that helps train the bright clinicians of tomorrow.\n\nThey also strive to make the hospital a less frightening and more familiar place for children by sprinkling a little fun and happiness into hospital days.\n\nAs a charity that relies entirely on gifts and donations, this is all made possible thanks to people like you.\n\nSwansea City chief executive, Julian Winter, said: “The club is very proud of its charitable work and we are committed to helping those in the community that need it most.\n\n“The club was inundated with nominations for our charity of the season, and we are delighted to be partnering with Noah’s Ark over the course of the 2022-23 campaign.\n\n“They do a tireless amount of work for children all over Wales and we are very much looking forward to giving them our support, while the club will also donate money to Joseph’s Smile and Ty Olwen – two other charities that are close to our heart.”\n\nDirector of the Noah’s Ark Charity, Suzanne Mainwaring, said: “We are hugely excited to be announced as Swansea City AFC’s charity partner for the 2022-23 season.\n\n\"The Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales cares for 73,000 children a year, which is enough to fill the Swansea.com Stadium some three- and-a-half times over. As Wales’ only specialist children’s hospital, we know that many Swansea City fans will have either needed the service themselves or know families who do. This partnership will go a huge way to ensuring that we can continue to provide the very best for them.\n\n“It’s been a particularly hard few years for Noah’s Ark families with many having to spend long periods apart due to pandemic restrictions.\n\n\"During the crisis we diverted much of our focus to supporting the hospital and its families in whichever way needed. But now is the time to move forward with the many plans we have to improve the lives of children of Noah’s Ark and we’re so happy that the Swansea City family will be part of that during the coming year.\n\n“We’d like to say the biggest thank you to everyone who voted for us and wish the very best of luck to the Swansea City team for the season ahead.\n\n\"We very much look forward to partnering with the club in our continuing mission to create brighter todays and better tomorrows for the children of Wales.”"
