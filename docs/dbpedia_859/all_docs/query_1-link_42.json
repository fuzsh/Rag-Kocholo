        "text": "A chance to reflect on last week... Sometimes we just put our head down and keep looking forward, but last week I decided to keep a draft email open and add the success stories to help give me that drive when I feel like I'm getting nowhere during the daily grind. When they are all put together they make for pretty powerful reading. I hope you agree! 🎖️ RAF service leaver – Offered their own Marston’s Partnership Pub in Uttoxeter. Well done to Abi Hartley for placing a fantastic candidate who will no doubt bring bags of skill from their military background to smash running their own pub. 🤗 Care experienced young person placed into a kitchen role in the West Midlands. A wonderful young lady placed into a Community pub in Craig Taylor's patch who will no doubt be a superstar. 🤝 Prison leaver – Placed into a kitchen role in Gloucestershire through our Excel programme. A brilliant candidate who brings so much talent to the table and will do great things in Terri Hill's patch. 🎉 2 x Internal promotions of Excel colleagues (Kitchen Assistant to Line Chef & Team Member to Supervisor). It is probably my favourite part of the job when I hear about people not only gaining employment, but developing and moving up the ladder. 📑 Prison leaver appointed in Gaia Angove's patch through Excel as a Chef in South Wales in a Premium Signature Pub after our very own Marston's Charitable Foundation’s supported with the financing of clearance documentation. Thank you to Clare Chinn and Bec Southall for supporting with funds to remove a massive barrier to employment for this gentleman. 👩🏫 3 pubs confirmed for our first cohort of Supported Internships through Landmarks Specialist College. Brian Harrison has been busy visiting our pub teams to support things to progress to the next stage! Very exciting. 👨🎓 1 Excel colleague onto a Level 3 Hospitality Apprenticeship. No prizes for guessing which superstar has enrolled onto his apprenticeship if you've followed my last few posts. Cameron will be part of our senior team in no time I am sure. At Marston's PLC we continue to strive towards being a fully inclusive employer that attracts, nurtures and develops people from all backgrounds. Let's see what this week will bring 🙌. #wherepeoplemakepubs #comeasyouare #madeinmarstons Victoria Holden Rebecca Griffiths Jessica Priest Claire Clarke Jan Lynegar Liam Powell Hannah Maddison Emily Bennett Laura Glover James Watts Gill Minor Leanne Lynch Robert Hodgkins Camilla Longmore H.

Around 5 months ago we advertised a position that included accommodation within the prison service to see if any men or women would be interested in a full time role in a beautiful part of the world that also includes free accommodation. The response was surprisingly poor, but as we all know in recruitment it is about quality and not quantity. With that in mind, the wonderful Helen Cox at HMP Leicester referred us a candidate who has knocked our socks off with how great he is. We interviewed Cameron twice over Teams whilst serving the last few weeks of his sentence, before offering him the role and eagerly awaiting his arrival at the pub. Since day 1 Cameron has grabbed the opportunity with both hands, runs front of house like he was born to do it and continues to receive positive feedback and shout outs through all guest feedback platforms 👏👏👏. Not only has this candidate secured full time work with a roof over his head, but the business has secured a team member that we would now be lost without and someone who is pushing the pubs key metrics around guest feedback even higher because of his ability. Pretty cool right? Cameron is nearly two months in and he wants to help us support more people leaving the justice system and he is now thinking about progression with Marston’s, which we will absolutely support. If you support prison leavers into employment you know how high the highs are and how low the lows are. I had a particularly rough couple of weeks at work not long ago, so to pick me back up Robert Hodgkins and I spent the day with Cam in his pub. It gave me the drive to put some negative experiences behind me and reminded me why I love this role and more importantly, it reminded me that if we all did our little bit in our organisations, we could have a lot more stories like this to share along with all the other benefits of hiring prison leavers. #wherepeoplemakepubs #excelprogramme #madeinmarstons #comeasyouare Claire Clarke Jan Lynegar Victoria Holden Jessica Priest Rebecca Griffiths Emily Bennett Hannah Maddison Laura Glover Gill Minor James Watts Abi Hartley Leanne Lynch Robert Hodgkins Jodie Murray Nick Allen (Assoc.

Thrive Careers Hub support young people, many of whom are care-experienced, with the skills and support to secure meaningful employment. The young people I chatted with were fantastic and we are currently working to secure roles for many of them within pubs at Marston's PLC. It was fantastic to also bump into Jess who I met doing a similar session in November who is now nearly 6 months into her employment with us as a Kitchen Assistant. Jess even said yes when I asked her to speak to the group about her journey into employment with us and her confidence has grown so much since we met last year, which was wonderful to see! If anyone in the Liverpool area is looking for some amazing staff, please give Thrive a message on here. #wherepeoplemakepubs #comeasyouare #madeinmarstons Claire Clarke Jessica Priest Rebecca Griffiths Victoria Holden Emily Bennett Hannah Maddison Laura Glover Abi Hartley James Watts Gill Minor Robert Hodgkins Jan Lynegar Nick Allen (Assoc.
