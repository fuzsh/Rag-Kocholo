        "text": "Dolphin Ward - E600\n\nAbout Us\n\nDolphin Ward is the children's hospital's cardiac ward. It is a 16-bedded located on level 6 of the hospital. 8 of these beds are in cubicles, of which 4 have en suite facilities. The ward takes patients from across the south west and south wales, receiving referrals from the children's emergency department and other hospitals in the region, as well as elective referrals. Dolphin Ward also has two teenage cubicles which are decorately differently and have some more mature facilities like ipod stations, and games consoles.\n\nPhilosophy of the Ward\n\nWe aim to provide family centred care and take patients and their parents and carers opinions into consideration when looking at their treatment plan. We will see lots of our patients again and again as they get older so we like to make sure our care is consistent from visit to visit; we hope this makes everyone who visits feel more comfortable at hospital.\n\nParent and Patient Facilities\n\nDolphin shares a parent kitchen and outdoor area with Penguin ward. We have parent toilet and shower facilities on the ward. All our cubicles have TVs. We have ipod docking stations and ipads available to borrow.\n\nPlay Facilities\n\nWe share a play room and play specialist with Penguin Ward, patients who are well enough can visit the main hospital activity centre on Level 5. We also have the Echo room on the ward, which is a specialist sensory room.\n\nOther\n\nWe have regular family and patient listening events in conjunction with the south west congenital heart disease network. We also have transition programmes in place for teenagers who are moving to adult services. We have an annual Christmas party for our cardiac patients.\n\nContact Us\n\nPhone: 0117 342 8332\n\nSorry, your browser does not support IFRAMES"
