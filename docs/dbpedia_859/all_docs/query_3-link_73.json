        "text": "Education\n\nPrimary education – Key stage 1 and 2\n\nPrimary school is compulsory for all children aged 5 to 11.\n\nKey Stage 1 (Foundation Stage) – years 1 and 2\n\nJuniors – years 3, 4, 5 and 6.\n\nWhen is it okay to have mixed-age classes? Classes for years 3 and 4 could be merged. That doesn't mean kids miss a year or repeat one. The work will be tailored to the class's needs. In addition to regular assessments, students in Key Stage 1 and 2 take more detailed tests. Annual reports on your child's progress will be sent to you. Key Stage 2 (year 6, aged 10-11) ends with SATs and your child moves on to secondary school.\n\nSecondary education – Key stage 3 and 4\n\nYour child will enter secondary school at the end of year 6, aged 10-11, and progress automatically each year. Teachers will assess and test students to track their progress. The GCSEs are taken at the end of year 11 (age 16). After these exams, students may choose to leave school or study for further exams to enter college or university.\n\nTransport\n\nWest Derby railway station was located to the south of Mill Lane in West Derby, Liverpool, England, on the North Liverpool Extension Line. It first opened on December 1, 1879. The station was closed to passengers in November 1960, and it was completely closed five years later.\n\n​\n\nDerby railway station has six platforms divided into two sections: A and B. Derby is well-served by train, and the train station is about 15 minutes' walk from the city centre, though there is also a taxi rank and a bus stop outside the train station."
