The Treasury financing which occasioned most of the decline in excess reserves is, of course, only of temporary effect, and rapid upbuilding of the member bank accounts can be expected in coming weeks as the Treasury again disburses the funds. The total of excess reserves, however, remained at $6,310,000,000, which is, to put it very mildly, an ample figure. Effective demand for credit accommodation remains relatively modest, although the steady improvement of commercial loans continues. The condition statement of weekly reporting New York City member banks, covering the period ended Feb. 5, shows an increase of $20,000,000 in commercial loans, to $1,963,000,000.

Other cash of the regional institutions declined and total reserves dropped $15,473,000 to $20,263,886,000. Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation increased $60,407,000 to $5,906,166,000.

But some nervousness developed as to the result of the Franco-German negotiations, and an easy tone was noted in most sessions of the week. Requests by the British Treasury for parliamentary appropriation of a further £1,600,000,000 for prosecution of the war also proved somewhat depressing influence. The gilt-edged section drifted slightly lower, and other departments of the London market took a similar course. Trading on the Amsterdam Bourse was quiet throughout the week, with a decline of the first two sessions offset by improvement in subsequent dealings.

The metal subsequently was sent to Dakar, in French West Africa, and possibly was one inducement for the unsuccessful attack made at Dakar last autumn by free French forces under General Charles de Gaulle, with the assistance of the British Navy. According to disclosures made on Wednesday by Georges Theunis, former Premier of Belgium and now Ambassador of the Belgian authorities in London, much or all of the metal has been reshipped to Belgium by airplane, allegedly at the demand of the German occupation forces. Acting in behalf of the Belgian Central Bank, M. Theunis obtained a writ from Justice Morris Eder, of the State Supreme Court, attaching up to $260,000,000 funds held in the United States for account of the Bank of France. The contention of the Belgian regime in exile is that France should not have transshipped the gold to Belgium and to German authorities.

Pierre Laval, who was dismissed recently as Vice-Premier of the Vichy regime, now seems to be regarded as little more than a tool of the German authorities who rule occupied France from Paris. This view of M. Laval probably is inaccurate, but there is no doubt of his fascist leanings, and the problems of France have been increased by his stand. Vichy dispatches indicate that the Germans want M. Laval reinstated as a powerful figure at Vichy, preferably as Premier. But Marshal Petain sent Navy Minister Admiral Jean Darlan to Paris on two occasions to negotiate on this and other matters. The outcome of the long struggle is not yet clear. It is evident, on the other hand, that food is becoming scarce and difficult to obtain in France and the Low Countries, and the pressure of famine possibly will be added to that of the Germans before long, Largely because of the light it throws on some recent developments, litigation here in New York on certain foreign balances is of much interest, This legal action concerns the difficult question of The Commercial & Financial 876 of the war.
