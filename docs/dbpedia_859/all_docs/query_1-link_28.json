        "text": "Thousands of people will head to Suffolk this week for Latitude Festival, which will be at full capacity as a government test event.\n\nThe four-day music and arts festival at Henham Park, near Southwold, begins on Thursday, when it will become the first major event to be held following the lifting of most Covid restrictions in England.\n\nWho is going to the festival?\n\nThe festival has a capacity of 40,000, made up of a combination of campers and day-ticket holders.\n\nMusic headliners include Wolf Alice, The Chemical Brothers, Bastille and Bombay Bicycle Club.\n\nOther acts lined up for the festival, which was cancelled last year, include comedians Bill Bailey, Katherine Ryan and Jo Brand.\n\nOrganiser Melvin Benn has said a number of ministers and MPs will be among the crowd at this year's event.\n\nBut that will not include Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive on Saturday, and Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who are self-isolating.\n\nWhat will the festival be like?\n\nOnce inside, the event will run as normal, with no social distancing, face masks or restrictions, organisers have said.\n\nPeople will be able to jump up and down, wave their arms around and have a hug with somebody safely, Mr Benn said.\n\nHe thinks it will be an \"emotional moment\" when the doors open, with it being \"the first event that opens properly as a camping event anywhere in the world\".\n\nWhat is a government test event?\n\nThe events research programme (ERP) was commissioned by the prime minister in February to test how mass gatherings could be held safely, and what measures would help reduce the risk of the virus spreading.\n\nEvents around the country were selected, such as the Euro 2020 semi-final and final at Wembley and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit, and some events were specially arranged, like the concerts at Sefton Park in Liverpool.\n\nThe government said the events were chosen based on settings that cover a range of criteria, including different audience capacities, outdoor and indoor venues and different layouts.\n\nWhat do you have to do to get in?\n\nTicket holders will be asked for either proof of a negative lateral flow test taken prior to travel on the day of arrival at the festival, or proof of full vaccination, the second dose having been received at least 14 days before the first day of attending the event.\n\nVisitors can also show proof of natural immunity based on a positive PCR test within 180 days of the festival, including 10 days' self-isolation following the result.\n\nChildren aged 11 or over will need to show a negative lateral flow test result before entry to the festival, but under-11s do not.\n\nThose attending will need to use the NHS app to show whether they are vaccinated, have tested negative or have immunity, if they live in England.\n\nPeople without a smartphone, or not registered with a GP, will have to print our or download their Covid status via the NHS website, or request a letter.\n\nThose travelling from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have different procedures to follow to show their Covid status.\n\nIf ticket holders have used a lateral flow test to show they are negative, they will have to take another 48 hours later.\n\nIf ticket holders test positive before the event, they cannot attend. If they test positive at the festival, they will be dealt with by the on-site medical team.\n\nIn both cases, anyone who tests positive will be given a refund, organisers said.\n\nWhat will happen after the festival?\n\nThe government will use the data from the event to help run future events more safely.\n\nIt aims to measure the risk of Covid-19 infection associated with attendance at a mass gathering by looking at those who subsequently request a PCR test from NHS Test and Trace, and then those who test positive."
