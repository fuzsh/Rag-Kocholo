        "text": "Here columnist Matt Gaw suggests how to ensure your festival is fun for everyone.\n\nThe decision to take my kids to Latitude last year was not an easy one. Indeed, the last time I had been to a festival all the toilets got pushed over and set on fire.\n\nAdmittedly, it seemed funny then, but with a three-year-old and a five-year-old in tow, the idea of flying cans of beer, bongs, burgers like owl pellets and late night drum and bass had lost some of its unsophisticated charm.\n\nOf course, Latitude is a mile away from the apocalyptic festivals of yesterday and, on the eve of what will be its tenth anniversary, is one of the pioneers of the true family festival.\n\nHaving said that, for those taking their families to Latitude for the first time this year, there are still things worth knowing that can make your experience even more enjoyable.\n\n1. Latitude is significantly smaller than festivals such as Glastonbury, but don’t be fooled into thinking that there won’t be much walking involved. The family camping area is much quieter than other areas due to the demographic, but also due to its distance from the main arena.\n\nFor those with children too big to be in buggies, it’s well worth making sure you’re ready to spend a whole day out – rather than thinking of nipping back to your tent or campervan at lunchtime. My back is still creaking from carrying an exhausted three-year-old on my shoulders and a five-year-old on my front to and from the arena.\n\nThere is also plenty of walking to be had once you reach the site proper – and I did regret not having the foresight to bring a radio flyer (a handy little wagon) to drag the kids about in.\n\n2. Planning is dull, but is sadly key. If you are determined to see a particular act, make sure you set the day up around it. The children’s area at Latitude is AMAZING – so amazing, that trying to convince a five-year-old to leave to watch performance poetry or Billy Bragg can be a very tough gig.\n\n3. Food. The grub at Latitude is a world away from traditional festival fare, but it can be pricey if you’re paying for every meal. While inevitably we weren’t organised enough to pre-prepare anything, our bacon was saved by ensuring we were always humping around a back pack groaning with snacks and water.\n\n4. Planning on meeting other families? Make sure you agree to meet at a time and location before you go (the entrance to the children’s area or the poetry tent are good spots) because mobile phone reception is poor at best. I spent a good wasted hour or two of last year’s Latitude waiting for friends only for a text to arrive the next day, suggesting a time that had already passed.\n\n5. Invest in the toilets. There are options to pay for exclusive toilets at Latitude and after last year’s experience I have to say it is money well spent.\n\nAlthough the facilities in the family section at Latitude are not bad at all, for parents who inevitably have to assist young children in the toilet – being somewhere light, clean and fresh smelling is almost a joy. On a similar glamorous note, I’d not be without my bucket with a lid when it comes to those night-time wees (both for children and adults who might have had one too many festival ciders.)"
