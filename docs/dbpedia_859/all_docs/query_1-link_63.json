        "text": "Botting in London.\n\nI have attempted to do the complete botting guide on London. If you see the River Thames mentioned expect Water Pokemon, including Magicarp and if your lucky Dratini. Stay in one area, or do the tour. Typically I'd try and stock up on Pokeballs in the first area due to the vast amounts of Pokestops, then catch about 100 Pokemon in each area, before going onto the next.\n\nHow to bot:\n\nMy suggestion is to wake up in the morning and set the kill switch for 4 hours (240 minutes), and bot in Area 1 to stock up on Poke balls and Star Dust. Go to work / school, then in the afternoon set the bot to work in one of the other areas for another 4 hours. Always have at least one day off a week where you don't log in the account.\n\nIf you are here for Mr Mime, your best bet is Area 1.\n\n17th February 2017 - 14th Migration update.\n\nLondon:\n\nArea1 = Not a nest but a general area. Mr Mime & Ditto.\n\nArea2 = Not a nest but a general area.\n\nArea3 =\n\nJubilee Gardens: ?\n\nGeraldine Mary Hamsworth Park / Imperial War Museum: Machop\n\nArea4 =\n\nVauxhall Park: ?\n\nVauxhall Pleasure Gardens: ?\n\nKennington Park: ?\n\nArea5 =\n\nGreen Park: Magmar\n\nSt. James's Park: Rhyhorn\n\nArea6 =\n\nHyde Park East = Houndour\n\nArea7 =\n\nBattersea Park: ?\n\nArea8 =\n\nWandsworth Park: ?\n\nArea9 =\n\nHampton Court Palace: ?\n\nHampton Court Park: ?\n\nBushy Park: ?\n\nArea10 =\n\nKew Gardens: Magmar\n\nArea11 = <---- highly recommended\n\nHolland Park: Swinub nest, with a decent amount of Natu, Wooper, Sentret, and Sentret\n\nArea12 =\n\nKensington Gardens: Scyther\n\nHyde Park: Houndour\n\nArea13 =\n\nRegents Park: ?\n\nArea14 =\n\nHampstead Heath: ?\n\nArea15 =\n\nWaterlow Park: ?\n\nArea16 =\n\nAlexandra Park: Omanyte\n\nArea17 -\n\nFinsbury Park: ?\n\nArea18 =\n\nHaggerston Park: ?\n\nArea19 =\n\nLondon Fields: ?\n\nArea20 = <---- highly recommended\n\nVictoria Park: ?\n\nMile End Park: ?\n\nArea21 -\n\nQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park: ?\n\nArea22 -\n\nDulwich Park: ?\n\nArea23 -\n\nCrystal Palace Park: ?\n\nOther Areas, in this guide:\n\nBull Ring, Birmingham, England\n\nTrafford Shopping Center, Manchester, England\n\nCribbs Causeway, Bristol, England\n\nCardiff Castle (Growlithe nest), Cardiff, Wales <---- highly recommended\n\nCardiff Bay, Cardiff, Wales\n\nEdinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nEdinburgh Zoo, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nAreas currently in testing:\n\nDublin Botanical Gardens, Dublin, Republic of Ireland\n\n53.372\n\n-6.27463\n\n500 Meters\n\nLoch Ness, Scotland (trying to find an area where the Pokemon will say it was caught in Loch ness)\n\n57.1453\n\n-4.67808\n\n1) Areas covered:\n\nStarting Point: Museum of London\n\nAlso Covering: City of London , St Bartholomew's Hospital, St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nLatitude: 51.5176\n\nLongitude: -0.0967848\n\nAltitude: 14\n\nRadius: 750 metres (0.750 KM) - Settings, General tab to adjust.\n\nBike Speed: 21 km/h (5.8 M/S) - Settings, General tab to adjust.\n\nExp/h: 21-26k\n\nExcellent for filling your bags up, there are loads of Pokestops about.\n\nExcellent for Mr.Mime, out of every 100 Pokemon caught 3-4 will be Mr. Mime based on my experience.\n\nGreat place to farm Star Dust due to Pidgey and Rattata everywhere, and Ditto as a result.\n\nPersonally I'd dump all items apart from Pokeballs and Max Potion and Max Revive.

As you head to the right hand side of the first photo, you will encounter huge amounts of Rattata, Pidgey and Spearow, ideal for farming Star Dust and Ditto candy, as well as Mr Mimes. Bute Park to the west is an excellent area to catch Pokemon, it is currently a Bellsprout nest. Dratini is also far more common in Cardiff than London in my experience, a few often spawn in the grass to the left of the Castle, near your log in location (see bottom left of second picture). Finally there also seems to be a tendency to have high IV Pokemon around Cardiff.\n\nDistance between Cardiff Castle and Cardiff Bay = 1.5 miles.
