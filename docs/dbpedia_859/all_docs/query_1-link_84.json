        "text": "The Independent on Sunday’s Happy List is all about celebrating those who help spread joy by doing little brilliant things that make a big difference. To spread some happiness of our own, The IoS’s Happy List is now giving you the chance to win a family ticket to Latitude Festival, plus on-site accommodation from Pink Moon Camping.\n\nIt’s 10 years since Latitude began, and you could be there to join its birthday festivities by entering our competition and telling us how you make someone happy. Taking place from 16 to 19 July at Henham Park in Suffolk, this year the festival’s theme is For Richer, For Poorer, For Better, For Worse, exploring how our fully connected world now means that our loved ones are always at our fingertips.\n\nThis “we’re all in this together” ethos underpins the Happy List, which seeks to shine a spotlight on those who work hard to improve our collective experience and what makes the Happy List so special is that the nominations are made by you, our readers.\n\nThe Happy List is supported by Grange Hotels, and this year The IoS has also partnered with the social-giving platform JustGiving to make the Happy List bigger and better than ever before. As well as appearing in the paper when The Happy List is published in June, every individual featured on it will also receive the accolade of being put forward for special recognition at the JustGiving 2015 Awards.\n\nAll we need is a little about the person you are nominating – their name, age and, if possible, a way to contact them – and the reason why you’re putting them forward.\n\nNominate online at independent.co.uk/happylist, via email to happy@independent.co.uk; or write to Lisa Markwell, Editor, The Independent on Sunday, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5HF.\n\nNominations close at midnight on Wednesday 20 May."
