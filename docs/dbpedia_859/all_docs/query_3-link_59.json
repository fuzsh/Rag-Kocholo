        "text": "The service provides a warm and nurturing environment so that we can identify and understand the symptoms, patterns and origins of psychological distress and help patients manage their condition. Our services emphasise not only the mental wellbeing of young people but also their educational, emotional and physical needs.\n\nOur hospital is based in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Children and young people have shared or en-suite bedrooms which are light and spacious. We actively encourage them to personalise the space to make it feel like a home from home, with pictures/posters and personal items.\n\nWe have an on-site Ofsted Registered school to support children and young people to continue with their education while in hospital. This helps to ease re-integration/transition to home when they are ready for discharge.\n\nTreatment approach\n\nTherapies used:\n\nCBT – Cognitive Behavioural Therapy\n\nCRT – Cognitive Remediation Therapy\n\nMVT – Motivational Enhancement Therapy\n\nInpatient\n\nWe offer an evidence based inpatient treatment programme focusing on moderate to severe eating disorders. All of our inpatient wards have access to a lounge, dining space, kitchen area and quiet room. Onsite we have an Ofsted registered school to enable the young people to continue with their schooling whilst in treatment.\n\nWe focus on four stages in the recovery process:\n\nStage 1: Re-establishing eating\n\nStage 2: Re-establishing eating with Family\n\nStage 3: Getting out and about\n\nStage 4: Getting back to normal life and preventing relapse\n\nAll patients that have completed a full treatment programme will be entitled to 12 weeks aftercare. This can be extended further than 12 weeks at an additional cost."
