Beginning promptly upon the convening at 12 o’clock the Senate pro-, ceeded to consider the various amend¬ ments which had been suggested by the Committee on Territories and whlc^ had been passed over. One of the first of these taken up w*as the amendment prohibiting the wale of Intoxicating liquors In what Is now Indian Territory for the nert ten years, and this w'a* displaced with a eubstitute offered by Mr. Gallinger which extended the amendment to the entire State for a period of twenty-one year* and this was adopted • • • The First Surprise. The first surprise of the day came when the committee accepted Mr. For- aker’s amendment providing for a sep¬ arate vote by each of the Territories of Arizona and New Mexico on the Con¬ stitution to be adopted by the proposed State of Arizona. That provision had scarcely been made a part of the bill when Mr. Bard presented his amend¬ ment whtch had been originally offered by Mr. Patterson, and which provided for the admission of New* Mexico a? a State without the addition of Arizona. This amendment proved to be the point around which all the subsequent pro¬ ceedings of Importance revolved. It was at first adopted bx the close vote of 42 to 40. This vote wyib takeh w*hl!e the Senate was sitting In Committee of the Whole, and was reversed In the Senate proper by the tie vote of 38 to 38. • • • Arizona Eliminated. PART OF THE CREW ESCAPES, But the Captain, Four Passengers and Others Probably Have Perished. Halifax. N. S.. Feb. 7.—During a rag¬ ing gale and blinding snowstorm, which has swept the Nova # Scotia coast for the past twenty-four hours, the ocean steamer Damara, of the Furness Line, ran on the rocks at Musquodobolt, thirty miles east of Halifax, early to¬ day and Is believed to have foundered with the loss of many lives. The first officer of the ship, with eighteen of the crew, escaped In one of the life boats and lauded at Pleasant Point, after a terrific struggle with wind and aea. Capt. Gorst, master of the Damara, four passengers and the rest of the steamer’s crew* left the ves- seUln another lifeboat They have not been heard of since and it Is feared they have perished. The occupants of the boat which reached shore were utterly exhausted, and many of them were badly frostbitten. They had a har¬ rowing experience, battling in the dark¬ ness for hours in the open boat against tempestuous sea* on a treacherous coast, with the thermometer ten do- greesbj^w zerp and. an iMxtic blizzard rapngrTThey landed on shore some time during the day and reached Lh telegraph office at Musqtiodebolt harbor this evening, whence they wired the first nows of the disaster to the agents of the Furness Line at Halifax,’to which port the Damara was bound. The survInfers say the steamer struck about 2 o'clock this morning w*hen Ihe blizzard was so thick that it was Im¬ possible to fee a ship’s length ahead, on what proved to be Musquodobolt ledge, five miles from the mainland. GAMBLING ON RACES St. Petersburg, Feb. 8, 12:15 a. m.— For the moment the .startling crime In Helsingfors hns withdrawn attention from the strike situation throughout Russia. To-day’s events In Poland and the Caucasus, how*ever. are quite se¬ rious enough In themselves. Disorders In the smaller industrial towns of Poland have added more than a score to the total of the killed, and troops have been sent to Warsaw and Kutno, eighty-three miles west of Warsaw, to quell uprisings there. The strike con¬ ditions In the Caucasus are becoming w*orse and traffic on the Transcaucas¬ ian railway Is Interrupted. Tho men employed in three St. Pe¬ tersburg factories threatened to w*alk out yesterday, but the grievance In this Instance, which was over strike pay, w*ns settled at a conference. A large nail factory In the Vasslll OstrofT section was burned yesterday, and reports of Incendiarism were cur¬ rent. hut appear to have been based 09 presumption rather than on proof. • • • A Socialist Manifesto. SUBJECT OF MESSAGE BY. GOV. FOLK. Asks Legislature To Repeal the Law Licensing Bookmaking At the Track. Subsequently the Senate decided by a vote of 38 »to 36 to entirely eliminate New Mexico and Arizona from the bill and this result had hardly been an¬ nounced when Mr. Bard, In slightly changed form, renewed his proposition for the admission of New Mexico as a &Uite, and this time the amendment prevailed by the vote of 40 to 37. One of the affirmative votes was, however, cast by Sir. Beveridge. In charge of the All. for the purpose of moving the re¬ consideration of the vote. He was pronvpf Jn entering this motion as soon a-s ihe result was announced, and the motion wa* laid cm the table by a vote of 39 to 38. The effect was to eliminate Arizona from the bill and to establish a State of New* Mexico and another of Oklahoma and Indian Territory. In this form the bill passed. • • • Bailey Hints At a “Trade.” Jefferson City. Mo.. Feb. 7.—Gov. J-oseph \\V.

Mr. Bail¬ ey Intimated that there had been a “trade\" regarding the adoption of an amendment, adding a portion of Arizo¬ na to Utah. The Mormon question also received an airing during the day. While the provision for the separate admission of New Mexico was under consideration Mr. Burrow's, chairman of the Commit¬ tee on Privileges and Elections, an¬ nounced his opposition to the bill and stated that It was due to the .practice of polygamy Jn that territory to such an extent tha4 he considered It unwise to take the administration away from the Federal authorities.

Tho assassination of the Procu¬ rator General of Finland, Solso- lon Solnlnen. Is believed to be undoubtedly due to political causes. The Associated Pres* was Informed at the Ministry of the Interior that Solnl¬ nen w*as long figo marked out for ven¬ geance by the young Fenoman and Sa- tenomnn pottle?, who regarded him as a traitor to hi* country. As Procurator General he held a position Independent of and in some respects even superior to that of the Governor General and he also was the leader of the old Fen- omart party, the influence of which no longer is dominant In the Diet, though It Is still preponderant In the Benate. It was a matter of surprise to person# familiar with th* Finnish situation that Eugene Schaumann directed his revol¬ ver at Governor General Bobrlekoff of Finland instead of at Solnlnen and the latter had long expected to meet a violent end. Extreme precautions were taken to safeguard his life, but these precautions lately were somewhat re¬ laxed, because the Finns appeared to have nettled dow*n to a policy of passive obstruction without resorting to vio¬ lent means.

The workmen appear to be effectually terrorized by the strikers. The manu¬ facturers are holding conferences dally, but thus far have been unable to agree upon a definite policy. The Governor maintains a firm position between the rattles and declares that If the manu¬ facturers close their shops he will re¬ gard them and treat them exactly os strikers. Strikers this afternoon tried to res¬ cue an arresled comrade who was in the hands of the soldiers. The latter fired, wounding three strikers. A general strike was declared at Wloc!aw*ek to-day.

After listening to a message from the President recomimnding a board of survey for the Philippine archipelago, the House at 5:36 p. m. adjourned until to-morrow a* 11 o'clock. SURVEY OF PHILIPPINES Recommended E*y the President In Message ^To Congress. Washington, Feb. 7.—The President to-day sent the following message to Congress: To the Senate and lions** of Repre¬ sentatives: Circumstances have placed under the control of tills Government the Philippine Archipelago. The- islands of that group present ne many interesting and novel questions with respect to tfyelr ethnology, their fauna and flora and their geofogy and m:iteml rueourecs as uny re¬ gion of the world. At my request, the National Academy of Sciences appointed a committee to consider and report upon the desirability of instituting scientific ex¬ plorations of the Philippine Islands. The report of this committee, together with the riq*ort of the Board <u Scientific Sur¬ vey* of the Philippine Islands, including a draft of h bill providing for surveys of th-^ Philippine Islands, which board was ap¬ pointed by me after receiving the report of the committee appointed by the Na¬ tional Academy of Sciences, with In¬ structions to prepare such estimates and make such suggestion* as might appear to it pertinent In the circumstances, ac¬ companies this message. The scientific surveys which should be undertaken go far beyond any surveys or explorations which the Government of the Philippine Islands, however completely self-supporting, could be expected to make. The surveys, while of course undertaken as to the people of the Phlitp- p.ne Islands, should he undertaken as a national work for the in formation not merely of the people of the /Phlltpjgoc Islands, but of the people of this coun¬ try and of the world. Only preliminary explorations have yet been made Ip the archipelago and it should be a matter of 8 ride to the Government of tire United tales fully *to Investigate and to describe the entire region. Bo far as may be con¬ vergent ivml practical, the work of this survey should be conduct, d In harmony with that of the proper bureaus of the Government of the Philippine lmt It should not be under control of the author¬ ities in the Philippines, for it should be undertaken a* a national work and sub¬ ject to a board to be appointed by Oin¬ gress or the president. The plan trans¬ mitted recommends simultaneous surveys In different branches of research. • ■rg.tn- ized on a co-operative system. This would tend to completeness, avoid duplication and render the work more economic*l than If the exploration were undertaken K lecemeol No such organized surveys ave ever yet b**T?n attempted anywhere; but Uk* Idea is in harmony with modern scientific and Industrial methods. I recommend, therefore, that provision b*‘ made for the appointment of o Board of Surveys to superintend the national survey* and exploration* to be made in the Philippine Islands, and that appro¬ priation be* made from time to time to meet the necessary expenses of such <n- vestlgatton. it 1 * not probable that the survey would be completed in n less period than that of sight or ten your*, but it I* well that It should be begun in the near future. The Philippine CorumHaalon and those responsible for the Philippine Gov¬ ernment are properly anxiuus (hut this survey should not be considered as an ex. pens*.* of that Government, but should be carried on and treated us a national duty In the interest of science.

Feb. 7.—Senator Cullom. formerly chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce, favors the passage of the Esch-Townsend bill for the reorganization of railroad rates, and believes the Senate should take it Just as it comes from the House and en.^ct It into law without amend¬ ment of any kind.

Chicago, Feb. 7.—Evidence that Hoch had gone to one Justice of the Peace twice within a year to be married to two different women was furnished the police there to-day. Justice KauUfmun exhibited a private memorandum book showing that In January, 1895, he per¬ formed the wedding ceremony between Hoch and Mrs. Minnie Warnke. who is now Mrs. Minnie Renken. The Justice's memorandum book also showed that In August. 1895, he had married Hoch to Mrs. Mary Stelnbeck- er. One of the two wives, Mrs. Ren¬ ken, was to-day brought by the police face to fpce with Gustav Strelow, whom she accused of being Hoch's con¬ fidential agent In various matrimonial ventures. Strelow denied the charge, stating that he had Hoch only once. In connection with an expressed be¬ lief that Hoch Is Identified with a maT known as John Ely. a woman who say* she married Ely four years ago told the Chicago police to-day one of the most remarkable storie* yet brought into the Hoch case. The woman, whose name the police will not gl\\e. declares that her hus¬ band chloroformed the mother-in-law, and when detected by his wlfe> rum¬ maging through a chest of drawers in the room where the mother lay un¬ conscious he explained that the aged woman had been taken sick, and, go¬ ing out on a pretext of getting a) doc¬ tor. he was seen no more. With him disappeared $100 of his wife's money. \"Hayes\" and “Bessing\" were stamped on linen left behind by Ely. and thl* leads to a theory that he Is Hoch. Bessing being the name under which Hoch Is said to have married a New York woman. KISSED HER OFTEN And Sh^ Turned »Her Money Over To Him.

A HITCH In Cooper’s Nomination For Revenue Collector. WELCH MAY GET THE PLACE. PRESIDENT QUIETLY ADVISED TO THINK TWICE. PANAMA CANAL CONTRACTS. Washington. Feb. 7.—[Special.]—J. Sherman Cooper’* nomination for the Danville collectorshlp ran against* a snag this morning and did not go to the Senate for confirmation. The President sent an order over 1o the Secretary of the Treasury early In th* day revoking his request of Saturday for Cooper** papers, which are again In the Treasury* flies. Representative-elect D. C. Ed¬ wards Is trying to figure it out how it all happened. In the meantime, both Repivrenfcatlve Hunter and Commis¬ sioner Yerkes are smiling quietly to themselves. The understanding Is that somebody tipped off to the President yesterday that he had better think over the case a while before appointing Cooper; that, perhaps. If there had to be a change in the office, r better man might be found for the Job. George W. We^ch, of Danville, was a name the President heard. Internal Revenue Commissioner Yerkes declines to talk. Representative Hunter says he never had any idea that Cooper would be ap¬ pointed. \"I am not at all surprised at the turn of affairs,” said Dr. Hunter. One of his friends suggested that Cooper once certified that seven hundred votes were greater than twelve hundred votes, and Ux&t a man to be Collector of Internal Revenue ought to be able to count better than that. Representative Hunter thinks If there Is n change In the office George Welch will land the place. Represomative-elect Edwards believes there is only n slight hitch, and that Cooper** name will be sent in be¬ fore a great while. ■ • « Indian Judges* Petition. Strong pressure Is^being brou^it to bear upon the Senate Indian Afffilrs Committee to have it amend the Indian Appropriation Bill so as to forbid the us* of Indian tribal funds for contract schools, but It is hardly likely the com¬ mittee will repudiate the action of the President authorizing such diversion of these funds. Senator Gamble, of South Dakota, to-day submitted to the Senate for reference to the committee A petition from four Indian Judges of the Pine Ridge agency. Judge Joe Fast Horse. Judge John Thunder Bear. Judge George White Fall and Judge Jo Eagle Hawk, protesting against the use of any of the tribal money for the support of contract schools, and ask¬ ing that this be prevented, even if It be necessary to enact new legislation. The Judges say: \"We have heard with great surprise that a contract has been given the Roman Catholic Church on this reservation by w*h 1 oh it Is to re¬ ceive s. part of the tribal funds of our people.\" The petition goes on to state that the Indians held a council on the subject and ore very much opposed to the pro¬ posed diversion. * • • Fenama Canal Contracts. <£ mtr: M gk-y mm nil JfiEL 1 Need Not Bring Suffering and Miseiy /S\\ This perfectly natural change In a woman's life Is too often ac¬ companied by painful, distressing symptoms due to female troubles and slight irregularities in her deli¬ cate organism.

Allison, of Iowa, had a long confer¬ ence with the President to-dny on the railroad rate legislation, and the un¬ derstanding is that they convinced the President that it would be unwise to try to force* legislation through the Senate at this session, and the best thing to do was not to call an extra session until the fall, about October, when plenty of time coutd be given the bill. • • • Rivers and Harbors Bill.

ADS BY COMPETITION. City Should Pay For Them At Reg¬ ular Legal Rates. L>nisvM1o, Ky.—The wagon or automo¬ bile. drvuruted and covered with pithy re¬ mark#. varr>ing a br.u# band, will servo to advertise the etrtet fakir; the gaudy poMer# on ail ’avuilable objects attract people, especially children, to the theater or circuH; but'the man or cirrorntion en- g.igcd in ordinary buxim-re ha# ieng since discovered thut the best place for an ad- ver:1*rmciu l* in the newspaper.

The subject nutter of the advertisement might b? eftxained In various ways. I'd ugge<st It be by comfTetltlve skill, like thl# effort of the Courior-Jourhnl. The#? tfst# should be held monthly and each of the four advertisenrent* whfdfi w*1n a prize might be used fbr one week, and the thirteenth week could be a o^vmrpl ri¬ ck n, by the managing editors, from the twelve preceding week*. Thi# advertfcsenttnt should b» placid In eaeh of the dally rup**T3 printed in L-tul*. ville and occupy wifhclent spicw to attract; attention anil to apical to the bus-lnes* capacity »f the reader, cauKlngih.m to help develop Louisville. The printing, as well as the prise*, should be paid'for by the city cf TxmLt- vllle, the former at the same rate as cthtr legal printing for the city, and the latter liberally. It this sohome were put In operation, editor# all over the country would repro¬ duce the advertisement In their paper#, and editors throughout the world would comment favorably on the p an. and with, in one year Louisville would be the best advertised city In the world. Capital would flow here, Lihorars would flock here and trade would flourish here* Very respect¬ fully, J. W. BROWN. Johnston street.
