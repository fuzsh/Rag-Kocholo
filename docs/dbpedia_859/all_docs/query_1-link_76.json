Iif they were they would see how cared for, healthy and unbothered by the dye they are.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have just been past them, and to prove how water-based and impermanent the dyes are, where it has rained overnight the sheep are a lot less pink today.\"\n\nLatitude Festival has been approached for comment."
