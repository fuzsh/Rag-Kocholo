"Muhammad Ali: A Man of Many Voices is a clearly written and accessible synthesis that provides students with a broad and life-spanning introduction to a significant athlete who impacted the world beyond the ring."

-Michael Ezra, author of Muhammad Ali: The Making of an Icon

"Muhammad Ali: A Man of Many Voices does a fine job of taking us through the Champ's life, including fine descriptions of his fights. Barbara Tischler ably describes one of the greatest sports careers of the twentieth century, but far more, she shows us why Muhammad Ali mattered, still matters. If any man defined his times--turbulent, painful, wild times--it was Ali, and Tischler shows us how and why."

-Elliott Gorn, author of The Manly Art and co-author of A Brief History of American Sports (with Warren Goldstein)

"With a balanced mix of primary sources and secondary literature, Barbara Tischler has written an accessible and approachable account about the greatest athlete of this generation, Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali: A man of Many Voices, is a reader friendly text that accurately captures the social significance and complex life of ‘The Greatest.’"

-Louis Moore, Associate Professor of History, Grand Valley State University
