        "text": "About the Book\n\nCassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. won the world heavyweight championship at the age of 22, the same year he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. He would go on to become the first and only three-time (in succession) World Heavyweight Champion.

Read Who Was Muhammad Ali? and discover “The Greatest.”\n\nProduct Details\n\nOn sale: July 24, 2014\n\nAge: 8-12 years\n\nGrade: Grades 3-7\n\nPage count: 112 Pages\n\nISBN: 9780448479552\n\nReading level: Fountas/Pinnell: V"
