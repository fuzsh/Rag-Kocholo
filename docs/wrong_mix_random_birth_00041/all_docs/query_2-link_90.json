Part of the book is told by Lucky and the other part is told by Cassius Clay. Why would the authors choose to write the book like this?\n\nBefore the championship fight in the Golden Gloves Championship, a reporter asked Cassius Clay if he thought he was as good as Joe Louis or Sugar Ray and Cassius told the reporter “I don’t think I’m as good, I’m Better.” How does Cassius Clay’s attitude about himself affect his boxing?\n\nDuring the fight with Francis Turley, Cassius Clay thought about “how boxing was gonna set me free, set us all free.” What did he mean?\n\nLucky says even after Cassius Clay lost his first Golden Gloves championship, he was still bound for greatness. Why would losing make him work harder?\n\nAt a young age Cassius Clay decided he wouldn’t drink soda. He wouldn’t smoke. He always went to bed at ten o’clock. He ran to school instead of riding the bus. What does this say about Cassius Clay?\n\nCassius Clay lived in the West End of Louisville. Due to segregation, this was one of the only places where his family could live. When Cassius went downtown, he did not see many people like him and couldn’t be served where he saw signs that said “White’s Only.” How would living in a place and time where you can’t do certain things or be certain places because of what you look like affect you?\n\nGranddaddy Herman’s sermons always ended with him saying (pp. 25-26) “Know who you are, Cassius. And whose you are. Know where you going and where you from.” What did he mean?\n\nCassius Clay loved Superman because he was stronger than anyone else and world-famous. He loved that he defeated villains and people called him a hero. Who is your favorite superhero? Why?\n\nCassius Clay says everyone in his neighborhood has a nickname. Cassius is Gee-Gee because that’s the noise he made as a baby. Big Head Paul has a big head. What nickname do you have? How did you earn it?\n\nCassius Clay’s daddy said “Gee-Gee, I want you to be the first of US to go to college. Do something with yourself.” Cassius was not good at school. He said “School’s not for me, Daddy. I’m gonna be a star, just don’t know how I'm gonna shine yet.” Is being good at school the only way to be a success? What does it mean to be a success?\n\nMrs. Clay told the boys there were some things you can say in the house that you can’t say outside. They had to be one way for themselves and another for the rest of the world. She was talking about how to behave around white people because of racism. Is this still true today? Is it just because of racism or are there other reasons? Do you have to act differently at home than in public?\n\nCassius Clay says having his bike stolen feels “lousier” than the natural disasters, wars and all kinds of human failings and tragedies that have happened that year. What is the lousiest thing that has happened to you this year?\n\nOne of the uplifting quotes in the Columbia Boxing Gym says “Winners are not those who never fail. They are those who never quit.” What does this poster mean?\n\nWhat’s the best way to make a dream come true?\n\nJoe Martin says “The fight is won before you get in the ring.” What does that mean to you?\n\n“Confidence is hard to understand. Hard to find. Hard to master.” What does this mean to you?\n\nWhy do you think Cassius Clay decided to go to work cleaning houses with his mom?\n\nLater in life a reporter asked Cassius Clay what he wanted to be remembered for. Cassius said “I’d like for them to say, he took a few cups of love, he took one tablespoon of patience, one teaspoon of generosity, one pint of kindness. He took one quart of laughter, one pinch of concern, and then he mixed willingness with happiness, he added lots of faith, and he stirred it up well. Then he spread it over a span of a lifetime, and he served it to each and every deserving person he met.” What do you want to be remembered for?\n\nDo you have a passion for something like Cassius Clay had for boxing? What will you do with that passion?\n\nCassius Clay later changes his name to Muhammad Ali. If you could change your name, would you? Why would you change it? What would you change it to? Why did you choose that name?\n\nIf Cassius Clay’s bike had not been stolen, how would his life have changed? Would he still have been a boxer?\n\nBook Talk Teasers:\n\nRead the reader’s theater for Becoming Muhammad Ali (coming soon).\n\nWatch the book trailer for Becoming Muhammad Ali embedded below.\n\nWatch the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt book trailer for Becoming Muhammad Ali (0:37):https://youtu.be/3LPzTrF6sIM\n\nColby Sharp booktalks Becoming Muhammad Ali (5:01):https://youtu.be/Vjd3uQDww8Y\n\nRead Alikes:\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nBolden, Tonya.

Nicknamed “The Greatest,” Ali was as well known for his unique boxing style, consisting of the Ali Shuffle and the rope-a-dope, as he was for the catchphrase “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” He was an uncompromising athlete who brought beauty and grace to a very rough sport and became one of the world’s most famous cultural icons.

First published October 15, 2020 (Booklist).\n\nBefore boxer Muhammad Ali was “The Greatest,” he was a boy named Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky, who aspired to be a winner. In this fictionalized biography, powerhouse authors Patterson and Alexander chronicle teenage Clay’s rise to fame in 10 chapter “rounds.” A childhood friend called Lucky starts each round with a prose narrative that sets the scenes to come in free verse poems told from Clay’s perspective. The poems, often rhythmic and reminiscent of the boxer’s inspiring, humorous, and artful expressions, relate Clay’s working-class neighborhood and his close friendships, bullies, and first ups and downs with love. Still more poems recount the teen’s undiagnosed learning disabilities, his coping skills, and his burgeoning views on racism. Readers feel the intensity rise in energetic poems that describe his fortuitous entry into boxing, focused training, quick thinking—on and off his feet—and prominent boxing matches leading up to his Golden Gloves championships and Olympic gold medal. Together, the prose and poems reflect Clay’s both public bravado and private humbleness as well as his appreciation and respect for family and friends. The “Final Round” gives a brief look at Ali’s professional career as heavyweight champion of the world and his guiding beliefs against injustice. Adding to the punch are Anyabwile’s large, expressive illustrations in a comic-book style. A knockout! —Angela Leeper\n\nUsed with the permission of Booklist https://www.booklistonline.com/\n\nSchool Library Journal starred (October 1, 2020)\n\nGr 4-8-Before the indomitable Muhammad Ali was known as a boxing legend and social justice leader, he was Cassius Clay, a young dreamer and fighter from Louisville, KY. As a young Black man, Cassius's childhood in the 1950s is shaped by the Southern United States' Jim Crow laws. Working towards a better life seems impossible; yet Cassius is a firm believer in who he is and where he's from. But where is he going next? It all begins with a stolen bike, a boxing ring, and unrelenting determination. Told in \"Ten Rounds,\" this utterly delightful story about Ali's childhood is a smash hit. Patterson handles narrator Lucky's prose while Alexander crafts Cassius's poetry. This creates a distinct, clear flow for each Round, starting with a thought-provoking intro which then progresses into Cassius's rhythmic expansion of events. Despite many roadblocks along his boxing journey, Cassius's positive, winning demeanor reveals that the biggest hurdle when pursuing a passion is one's mindset. Though the overarching narrative ends with the 1959 Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, the \"Final Round\" chapter overviews Ali's life in and out of the ring. A bibliography is included. VERDICT The overwhelming positivity filling the pages encourages readers to never be afraid of who they are, making this story golden.
