        "text": "Product details\n\n-- THIS IS A SECOND-HAND BOOK--\n\nBoxing Book\n\nby Thomas Hauser\n\nMuhammed Ali's life\n\nFull account of his life\n\nGreat read\n\nMuhammed Ali His Life and Times Description\n\nAn unexpurgated biography of an American legend draws on the words of more than two hundred of the great boxer's associates, opponents, friends, enemies, and Ali himself. Using extraordinary and revealing interviews with Ali, his family, ring opponents, and others, Pulitzer Prize-nominee Thomas Hauser shows what an amazing effect this deeply religious man had on sports fans and millions of people around the the world. Leifer has photographed for Sports Illustrated, Time, and Life for almost 30 years. 175 illustrations, 125 in color. Photographs trace the career of the former world heavyweight boxing champion and are accompanied by brief reminiscences of people who followed and were influenced by his career.\n\n'On the Back' of Muhammed Ali His Life and Times\n\n'A monumental achievement, a carefully orchestrated account through the words of a vast and varied range of people whose lives were touched by Ali. It documents every facet of his extraordinary life THE DAILY TELEGRAPH\n\n'We now have the definitive biography of Muhammad Ali, who transcended sports as no other athlete ever has. NEW YORK DAILY NEWS\n\n'The most significant boxing book ever written.’ RING MAGAZINE\n\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.\n\nAll I really wanted was someday to buy my mother and father a house and own a nice big car for myself...' One of the most recognised, admired and inspirational men on earth, Muhammad Ali is the world's most famous boxing hero. A number one bestseller in hardback, this is the authoritative, award-winning and highly acclaimed biography - written with Muhammad Ali's full co-operation - against which all other biographies of the great man are measured. In the words of over two hundred of Ali's family members, associates, opponents, friends and enemies, this unique portrait relates his legendary sporting accomplishments as well as the high drama of his life outside the boxing ring. Charismatic and dedicated, Ali brought speed and grace to the sport, and gravitas to his chosen causes. This is the biography to match his achievements.\n\nThomas Hauser is a New York City attorney, Pulitzer Prize nominee and the author of thirty books including Missing, which became an Academy Award-winning film. His nine boxing titles include The Black Lights: Inside the World of Professional Boxing, Brutal Artistry and Mark Twain Remembers.\n\nShipping Muhammed Ali His Life and Times\n\nWe have a few different options for posting your items at Enso Martial Arts Shop.
