        "text": "I think this 2022 published biography of Muhammad Ali just might be my favorite. At 40 pages long and meant for first graders and up, it actually mentions that he is Muslim in multiple places. So often these biographies about him or Malcolm X fail to incorporate their religion and just relegate their name changes to a footnote or after thought. The book is engaging, informative, it is sourced, and the illustrations adorable. My kids and I have read the book multiple times and are still enjoying the detailed illustrations (they even include #muslimsintheillustrations) and text. Sports fans and even those that are not will appreciate what Muhammad Ali achieved, overcame, and accomplished.\n\nThe biography starts at Muhammad Ali’s birth and ends with his fight in Zaire- detailing his personality, growing up, how he got into boxing, becoming Muslim, refusing to go to war, and his biggest fights. It weaves in how he worked against racism, standing up for his religion, and living life on his terms, at every step. As the chronological story fades, it shows him lighting the Olympic flame in Atlanta, and the text starts to focus on the lessons that Ali fought to highlight, by encouraging us to continue his legacy.\n\nThe illustrations show how his message is still powerful and inspiring to athletes, kids, ordinary people-everyone, the world over. Ali stays depicted as a small child throughout, and the author captures his charisma, charm, and entertaining persona. The final spread before the sources and further reading suggestions show a timeline of Muhammad Ali’s life and a few photographs of his life.\n\nI need to read the other books in the series to see if they are just as engaging. Undoubtedly Muhammad Ali’s story is entertaining and inspiring even when poorly written, but I have a feeling this particular biography really shines because the author and the subject matter came together. I highly recommend this book for families, schools, and classrooms alike."
