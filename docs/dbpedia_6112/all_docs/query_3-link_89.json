We’re here to tell you about the best gangster movies on Netflix right now. If you haven’t ditched the streamer for one of its alternatives, you’ll know there are tons of new shows and movies to check out every week, including plenty of crime titles.\n\nNetflix’s selection of gangster movies is robust, but many of the heavy hitters are missing. For example, the series of Godfather films and Goodfellas are nowhere to be found on the service. However, there are some bonafide classics available, as well as a few off-the-beaten-path gems you should check out. Don’t have Netflix? You can sign up at the link below.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix is still the leading premium streaming service, with over 200 million worldwide subscribers. It offers thousands of movies and TV shows to binge watch, including its always growing list of original films and series, including Stranger Things, The Witcher, Bridgerton, and many more.\n\nThe best gangster movies on Netflix\n\nEditor’s note: We will regularly update this list of the best gangster movies on Netflix as films come and go from the service.\n\nThe Raid 2 (2014)\n\nNetflix\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 150 minutes\n\nDirector: Gareth Evans\n\nMain cast: Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Oka Antara, Tio Pakusadewo, Alex Abbad, Julie Estelle\n\nGenre: Action/crime/martial arts\n\nRatings: 7.9 – IMDB / 82% – Rotten Tomatoes\n\nA sequel to 2011’s Indonesian action-thriller The Raid, The Raid 2 sees Jakarta cop Rama dealing with the fallout of his actions in the first film. Wanted by dangerous criminals, he goes deep undercover to protect his family from retaliation. Befriending the son of a crime boss, Rama gets deeper and deeper with plans to take down the criminal empire from the inside.\n\nFeaturing more stunning fight choreography, The Raid 2 is a terrific compliment to the first film and a knockout standalone actioner.

The epic gangster film is based loosely on the real-life story of Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a World War II veteran and truck driver who eventually became a hitman for the mob and was involved with the late head of the Teamsters Union, Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nWhen this movie was first released, many reviewers wrote about how advanced technology was used to “de-age” De Niro and other cast members to tell a story across decades. Thankfully, the technology takes a backseat to a gorgeous, heartbreaking story about cycles of violence. A spiritual sequel to Scorsese’s Goodfellas, The Irishman is a mob movie masterpiece.\n\nReady to watch?
