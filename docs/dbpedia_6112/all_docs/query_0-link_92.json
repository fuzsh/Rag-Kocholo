        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n“Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight… It’s a shame, but I expected more from you. I think some time out of the public eye might be good.”\n\nFuck his life.\n\nWhen Katsuki arrives at his shitty rental cottage, summer is in full-swing. It’s hot as fuck, and the humidity bears down on him like a wet blanket and makes his shirt stick to his skin. Normally, this kind of weather would be useful— plenty of amo for his quirk to use on the job. But he isn’t on the job right now, and won’t be for at least the next two months. Ugh. Fucking… twenty-three years old and stuck on desk-duty. Transferred to the middle of bum-fuck nowhere to help a semi-retired pro establish an agency in the sleepiest, safest, most forgotten corner of the country. It’s pathetic.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the place he’s renting apparently doesn’t have AC. The moist air inside is more oppressive than the heat outside. Katsuki sets his bags down in the foyer with a huff. He’s not winded from carrying the two medium-sized duffle bags half a mile from the town center. He’s not. He’s fine.\n\nKatsuki goes back out to stand on his front step. He looks around, shielding his eyes from the glaring sunlight. It’s country-side as far as the eye can see. There are carcasses of beetles under his feet; a chorus of cicadas and frogs, tall grasses that sway gently despite the lack of any wind, a weird rock, a dildo, flying through the air… and Katsuki’s neighbor, Izuku Midoriya.\n\n“Waacchan! My bad!” Katsuki stares down at the man he’s known since childhood. Izuku is kneeling on the ground in front of a similar cottage to his, just a couple meters from his front door. He’s got an electric fan in front of him, as well as a roll of duct-tape and various tools.\n\n“… ’Sup, Nerd?” Katsuki leans down and picks up the object that had nearly just poked his eye out. It’s definitely a dildo— violently orange colored and at least six inches. What the fuck?\n\n“Please stop looking! It’s embarrassing!”\n\n“Haah? Why do you even have this?!” Of all the things Katsuki expected when he came to this god-forsaken rural hellhole, Pro Hero Deku with a bright orange dildo wouldn’t have made the list even if someone had painted him a picture of the scene and then forced acid down his throat.\n\nYes, he knew that Deku was also spending time in the countryside. Since the embers were now really fading, Izuku has stepped back from more active hero-work. And Katsuki has many thoughts about that, but… Logically, it makes sense that the Hero Commission would put two down-and-out pros in similar accommodations. Still. It’s too much. He can’t even begin to process the ideas of Izuku and sex toy together without feeling like he’s going to combust—literally. So Katsuki does the normal thing, and chucks the— phallus— at Izuku’s face.\n\nNormally, he knows Izuku would catch it— even without One For All or Danger Sense, the hero never let his instincts go lax— but the nerd is too flustered to do anything but let it bounce off his forehead. “Ouch!”\n\n“Are you a pervert now?! Did too much time in the country-side make you lewd?!” Katsuki ignores the way his voice cracks. His face his probably bright red. What the fuck what the fuck what the fuuuuuck—\n\n“I-I’m not a pervert! I attached it to the fan for a test but it flew off…” Izuku rubs the back of his neck. He’s clearly been spending a lot of time outdoors. All of his freckles are in full bloom— except the ones that he lost when Shigaraki fucked up his face. The scar is bright white against the tanned skin of Izuku’ cheek. Katsuki scowls, feeling the scar on his own cheek tighten.\n\nHe doesn’t know what to say. Izuku looks up at him from the ground with wide eyes; the absolute picture of innocence. Katsuki stares back at him, half convinced he actually died during his last hospital stay, and this is all some crazy, last-moments-of-his-life hallucination. They stare at each other, unblinking.\n\n“…”\n\n“…”\n\n“Okay. Good to see you, Izuku.” And Katsuki steps back inside his stuffy cottage, slamming the door shut with a loud “THWACK!”\n\nThe next morning, Katsuki stands on his front step again and evaluates his life choices. He should be cracking the Top Five in the rankings by now. Instead, here he is:\n\nTransferred from his top-ranked agency to a tiny startup in the countryside. Forbidden from using his quirk for the next four weeks. Expected to file paperwork detailing the last hundred years of criminal activity for a prefecture he’s pretty sure most people have never even heard of. He’d be surprised if there’s ever even been a villain, out here. What kind of crime could someone even commit? Tipping over a cow?\n\nIt feels like a demotion. And he can’t escape Izuku. Besides Katsuki’s new boss, Deku is going to be his only coworker.\n\n… Fucking. Stupendous.\n\n“Aaagh. It’s too damn hot!” Katsuki had spent the whole night sweating and staring up at his ceiling, praying for a ceiling fan to materialize out of thin air. He hadn’t thought about why the fuck Izuku had a dildo. Not at all. And why was he attaching it to an electric fan…?\n\n“Enough.” Katsuki says, stepping out from the minimal shade offered by his doorway and into the blinding sunlight. It’s only eight in the morning, but he already feels moisture collecting along the back on his neck; beading between his shoulder blades, dripping down his forearms from underneath the rolled-up sleeves of his button-up shirt and pooling in his palms.\n\nMaybe he should get a car… But that would be admitting defeat. There’s no way in hell Katsuki wants to languish out here in the sticks for any longer than he has to. That’s right… I’m not the type to rot in the countryside like this. Watch me! I’ll show you what I can do!\n\nHe crouches in front of the weird rock that sits in the grass halfway between his temporary new home and Deku’s.\n\nIt’s actually a small statue of a weird little bird-like creature. It sits on a small, flat base, and only reaches Katsuki’s mid-calf in height. Its beak makes up most of its face, and its closed eyelids are sitting weirdly high on the top of its head. Someone has tied a tiny, fabric apron around its front. It’s the weirdest looking jizo statue Katsuki has ever seen. Still… couldn’t hurt. As he claps his hands together, the statue’s weird beak almost seems to grin.\n\n“I pray to return to Tokyo soon.”\n\n“Dynamight, can you make copies of this?” Work at Gran Torino’s brand new agency is fine. He’s not sure why the old geezer won’t just properly retire, but hey— who is he to judge? Katsuki plans on being a hero until the moment he kicks the bucket, too. He would never set up an agency so far from where all the action is, but if this is what the Old-Timer wants, it’s fine.\n\n“Ah—, Yes.” Busy work… but it’s fine.\n\n“Dynamight, could you organize the data I just sent?”\n\n“Sure.” Oh, incident reports… for people falling in rice paddies. Fuck his life. Whatever. At least Deku is here too. The Deku in question looks up from an ancient copy machine and smiles at him. Katsuki rolls his eyes. This is fine.\n\n“Dynamight, where did I put my tea leaves?”\n\nIs the old man going senile…? It’s two in the afternoon. Torino has asked Katsuki to make tea three times already. Stop it. He’s a veteran. He taught All Might. “Uh… second shelf from the left.”\n\nAt around four o’clock, right when the cicadas start to come out in droves, Gran Torino tells them they’re done for the day. It’s probably the lightest workload Katsuki has ever had. And yet— he’s exhausted. He’s so ready to get back to his tiny, stuffy house and stand under the cold shower until his balls freeze off, but—\n\n“Dynamight, do you not want to come bug catching? We coated honey on the tree outside this morning.”\n\nKatsuki takes a deep breath. He lets it out slowly through his nostrils. Counts down slowly, in his head, like he was taught to do in the hospital almost ten years ago. Five. Four. Three. Two—\n\n“Oh! We used to do that when were kids! Do you not want to come beetle-hunting with us, Kaccha—?”\n\n“IT’S GREAT EXPLOSION MURDER GOD DYNAMIGHT!”\n\nGran Torino is entirely unfazed. “Ah, okay. No need to shout.”\n\nAAAAAHHHHHHH! Katsuki has to press a button on his wrist to shut off the beeping. Izuku looks concerned, but he shuts up when he sees whatever expression is on Katsuki’s face. Instead, he grabs a small net and follows Gran Torino outside.\n\nKatsuki sits down and puts his head in his hands. He can’t believe he’s supposed to be here for another two months. At least. Once again, he wonders if he’s actually dead— except now he’s considering the possibility that this may be hell.\n\n…Well, it probably can’t be, since Izuku is here. Katsuki sighs. He unbuttons the top button of his shirt and leans back in his chair. He looks out the window and sees Izuku (not Deku, anymore, since they’re off the clock… even if they didn’t do anything to remotely feel like heroes today) and Gran Torino staring up at a tree. From the open window of the newly-established Gran Torino Agency, Katsuki can just make out the gist of their conversation:\n\n“—Nope, nothing but normal beetles today.”\n\n“Maybe they only come out in the evening?”\n\n“I’d catch loads of rhinoceros beetles or Kuwa beetles in the old days.”\n\n“Kacchan and I used to go into the woods near our neighborhood to look for bugs in pre-school. Kacchan always caught loads of stag beetles!” Hah. Damn right he did.\n\n“That’s nice. Who is Kacchan?”\n\n“Oh! A female rhinoceros beetle!” Izuku seemingly ignores the fact that Gran Torino might be a few states short of a United States of Smash in his excitement to point out the bug. Like a little kid… Katsuki finds himself grinning.\n\n“Yay!”\n\n“Cage it! Cage it!” Izuku’s excitement is adorable. Katsuki wants to go out there and join them. He’ll find the best beetles— and catch them for the nerd. Just like back in Mustafu. Just like when Izuku and the other extras would follow him through the woods chanting, “Forward march and here we go! Members of the Agency Bakugou!”\n\nHe’s half-way out the door before he realizes that instead of catching villains, he’s excited at the mere prospect of catching bugs.\n\nThis is hell. Katsuki is in hell. He sinks to the ground and hugs his knees.\n\nThis is it. This is what almost twenty years of training to be hero has gotten him. This is what fighting in a war at seventeen has gotten him. He gives up. He’s going to die without ever having cracked the top-five, in some back-water town in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere, after spending what should be his golden years as a pro catching beetles with Izuku.\n\n“Oh! I found a scaredy-Katsuki.” So the old man does know his name. Katsuki glares up from his spot on the floor. He can’t see where Izuku has gone. Only Gran Torino is standing in the open doorway.\n\n“…Leave me alone.”\n\nGran Torino clucks his tongue. “Wanna go to Kurogiri’s place?”\n\nKatsuki picks his chin up from where it’s pressed against his knees. So this is where that teleporting-bastard ended up. Figures.\n\n“…Yes.”\n\n“Oh… Bakugou-san. Welcome.” Kurogiri— Or is it Oboro, now?— says as they push aside the curtain entrance to a small bar about five minutes walk from Torino’s agency. “You’ve been visiting every day lately, Torino. Should Midoriya be worried about you?”\n\n“It’s fine. It’s fine. Midoriya is right here.” Gran Torino says.\n\nThe nerd smiles up at them from a stool at the bar. He’s holding a glass that looks like it’s mostly ice at this point. “Hi Torino! Hi Kacchan!”\n\n“…Tch. Hi Izuku.” Katsuki sits down between Izuku and another man that looks like he’s a few years older than them.\n\nThe guy smiles at Katsuki and reaches out to shake his hand. “Oh! Haven’t seen you around. Are you the new guy who’s joining Sorahiko’s new agency?”\n\n“Yeah! He transferred here from Jeanist’s organization.” Izuku answers before he can get the words out. Katsuki winces at the blatant acknowledgment of his professional failings, but shakes the older guy’s hand anyways, for lack of a reason not to. What’s the point in being rude today? He’s stuck in limbo with Izuku, exhausted from doing barely anything, and he really needs a drink. The guy whose hand he shakes is dirty blonde. He's taller than both Katsuki and Izuku, though that isn’t saying much.\n\n“Hahah, nice! I’m Takeshita, the only other pro in this prefecture. Nice to meet you!”\n\n“Hey.”\n\n“Kacchan! Takeshita knows Gentle!”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Yeah…” Takeshita looks uncomfortable at the mention of the former-criminal-turned-tech-billionaire’s trophy-husband. “We were classmates in high school. We weren’t very close though…” He rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. Katsuki raises an eyebrow. Complicated relationship with a former classmate? Wonder what that’s like…\n\n“…’Kay.” Katsuki says, and takes a big gulp of the drink Kurogiri sets down in front of him. It’s sweet for his tastes, but the temperature helps cool him down.\n\nThey sit for a few minutes in peaceful silence. A few more customers come into the bar. Kurogiri/Oboro greets them all by name. Katsuki wonders whether or not his former high school teachers know that he’s here. Then he wonders if the locals are aware that the owner of the only bar in town is run by a former member of the League of Villains. Too weird. He shakes his head and downs his drink.\n\nIn Tokyo, this would be where he stops for the night. Even on his days-off as an active Pro, Katsuki didn’t need the headache or the empty calories that came from alcohol. But he’s not currently an active Pro. And tonight he wants to drink to forget that fact.\n\nThe sun sets outside. Katsuki has a couple more drinks. So does Izuku.\n\n“Sorry again for what happened outside our houses yesterday, Kacchan.” He whispers conspiratorially, leaning into Katsuki’s space. For a second, Katsuki doesn’t know what he’s talking about— but then the flush on Izuku’s cheeks reminds him of the flush he’d had when Katsuki chucked the dildo back at his face. He takes another big gulp of his sochu cocktail. Kurogiri comes back with a carafe.\n\n“…It’s fine.” He murmurs. Izuku hums and bobs his head up and down too fast, looking goofy. He’s drunk. Katsuki wants to pinch his cheek— the one without the scar.\n\nOn Katsuki’s other side— the one without a nerd taking up his personal space— Takeshita looks up from his phone. “Oh, are you neighbors?”\n\n“They’re both staying in the houses that the Hero Commission bought last year.” Kurogiri says. His smokey face makes it hard for Katsuki to read into his words.\n\nHe squints at the bartender. “How’d you know that, Smoke-man?”\n\nIzuku laughs. “Oh, Kurogiri is still pretty sharp, huh?”\n\n“Even before Bakugou came, weren’t you fussing around about a Pro from the city coming to town, Torino?” Kurogiri asks.\n\nKatsuki startles, and looks over Izuku’s shoulders as he leans against the bar top. Sure enough, the tiny hero is still with them. The Old-Timer nods his confirmation to Kurogiri’s question. “Yup. They’re both here for the next few months.”\n\n“…hn…”\n\n“Ah, Kacchan—“ Izuku hiccups. “Why are you here? You didn’t just come to see me, right?”\n\n“Hah?” Katsuki frowns. His face tingles. It makes him frown harder. “Why would I have moved in next door if I was just coming to visit you? Think, Dek- Izuku!”\n\nIzuku’s eyes widen. “So the rumors are true?”\n\nKatsuki blanches. Ah, fuck.\n\n“The reason for your transfer…” Izuku trails off.\n\nShit. Don’t panic. Katsuki has prepared for this. He knew that people were inevitably going to ask questions. What is a strong young hero like you doing in a place like this? So he’s thought up an explanation in advance. “Ahhh… you mean because of my heart surgery? It’s nothing. They even flew in a doctor with a special quirk from over seas to treat me. I just need to spend a few months in recovery, and then I’ll be back to kicking ass in no time—just you watch, Nerd!”\n\n“Ehh? You had open-heart surgery?” Gran Torino asks, as if he himself didn’t have to sign off on Katsuki’s transfer.\n\n“Fuck yeah! Don’t let anything stop you!” Says Takeshita, raising his glass in a toast.\n\n“Eh—?” Izuku looks confused. He cocks his head to the side. He looks so innocent that Katsuki is hit with the sudden urge to bite him. “I mean, I heard about your surgery— That doctor’s quirk is so cool! But wasn’t there another reason—?“\n\n“What?” Katsuki snaps. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. “Are you the type to believe exaggerated rumors now, I-zu-ku?”\n\nIzuku’s face flushes. He sets his glass down slowly on the bar top, then looks back up at Katsuki, suddenly appearing more sober than he has since Katsuki got here. Despite the oppressive humidity, he feels a shiver run down his spine at the searching look Izuku gives him.\n\n“Nerd…” He says. It’s a warning.\n\n“I mean, you could have recovered from surgery in Tokyo. You didn’t have to transfer to Gran Torino’s agency.” Izuku shrugs. He’s being too casual. Katsuki doesn’t like where this is going. How many drinks has Izuku had already? He got here before Katsuki and Torino did…\n\n“Wasn’t the reason really…”Oh no. “—because Kacchan gave himself a heart attack doing naughty things in Best Jeanist’s office?”\n\nSilence. Katsuki can feel his face burning. He wonders who told Izuku. Kirishima? No. He was sworn to secrecy. “N-No!”\n\nGran Torino hums lightly into his scotch. Takeshita and Kurogiri exchange glances over the bar. Katsuki grits his teeth, cheeks warm. “Be. Quiet. Izuku.” He’s not begging. It’s a threat.\n\nIzuku snorts. He swivels in his chair to make eye contact with Katsuki. If he was cleared to use his quirk, Katsuki would have blown him up already— long-standing complicated rivalry-turned-friendship aside. Actually, he’s reconsidering their friendship now.\n\nIzuku leans forward in his chair. It wobbles dangerously. Then he opens his stupid mouth and says in one breath: “KacchanwasusingasextoyforanalpenetrationinJeanist’soffice!”\n\n“DEK—IZUKU” Katsuki tries to cut him off, but he ends up choking on his tongue. It’s too late, anyways.\n\n“He thought he was alone because it was late at night, but he got too excited and passed out! A sidekick heard him fall and burst in expecting a villain, but instead they had to call an ambulance!” Izuku elaborates, looking pleased with himself for getting the whole story out.\n\nFor a moment, if a pin dropped in the bar, everyone would be able to hear it.\n\nIzuku hiccups, and his words suddenly seem to register in his brain. He brings his hands up and flaps them around, suddenly panicked. “Actually, Kacchan, now that we’re talking about it, I’m really glad you’re alright—!“\n\n“HOW THE HELL DID YOU FIND OOOUUT?!” Katsuki does not wail. He doesn’t. He may or may not slump forward so that his head thumps against the bar.\n\n“Woah, he admitted it.” Takeshita whispers.\n\n“Who TOLD you?!” Katsuki cries.\n\nIzuku flaps. “Waaa— Kacchan! It’s okay! What’s important is that you recovered!”\n\nKatsuki slams back the rest of his drink. He feels half of it miss his mouth and spill down the front of his shirt.\n\n“What a waste…” Gran Torino murmurs.\n\n“Jeanist told me…sniff… it wouldn’t go public.” Katsuki can hear himself mumbling. He’s distantly aware that everyone is staring at him. That’s fair. If he was sober right now, he would probably be reacting differently.\n\nKatsuki is well aware of the ridiculousness of the situation. If he was anyone else, he would be pointing and laughing at the idiot who gave himself a heart attack while masturbating in his boss’s office. Instead, he’s the one sniffling and crying while trying to explain himself. God, he’s so pathetic. “I was just stressed out…” He hiccups. I’d worked double shifts all week… I didn’t think there were any sidekicks left in the office…”\n\n“So it was at work…” Takeshita whispers to Izuku.\n\nKatsuki stands up. His stool scrapes against the floor. He wobbles, then rights himself against the bar. “I’ll resign.”\n\nIzuku gasps. “Kacchan! No!”\n\nKatsuki ignores him. It’s too late. Izuku knows, and he’s been living in the goddamn boonies. Which means that everyone back home probably knows as well. His life is over.\n\n“I’ll quit being a hero!” Katsuki declares. This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to him. Worse than dying, actually. He’s mortified, and there’s absolutely no way he can come back from this. “I came to this shitty countryside because the surgery went really well. I thought I only had to recover, but now if I go back and—“ He hiccups. “—And everyone knows—“\n\nHe can feel fat tears rolling down his cheeks. It reminds him of the last time he sobbed in front of Izuku— that day he learned that his most important person rival no longer had One for All. Except the reason he’s crying now is infinitely stupider.\n\n“I’ll be a disgrace!” He wails. Izuku grabs his hand. Katsuki can’t take it.\n\n“Leave me alone!” He says, and he moves to run out of the bar. The hand on his wrist tightens.\n\n“Ah— wait! Wait a sec!” Izuku shouts.\n\nKatsuki turns. He must look like a mess right now; tears and snot leaking down his face. This is embarrassing. He really wishes that Izuku wasn’t present for all of his worst moments.\n\nIzuku’s face is flushed. He opens his mouth a couple times. The hand on Katsuki’s wrist squeezes. “I… I…” Sweat drips from Izuku’s forehead. He heaves a shuddery breath.\n\n“I understand what Kacchan feels right now.”\n\n“Izuku…” Katsuki says. He wipes his snotty nose on his sleeve. “…being quirkiness and being a laughingstock are not the same.”\n\nIzuku grimaces and shakes his head. “Tha— That’s not true…” He stands up, rolling his shoulders back like he’s preparing himself for a battle. Even red-faced and drunk, Izuku still looks every bit the hero he’s always been to Katsuki. He glances down at the hand holding his wrist. Are you alright? Are you hurt?\n\nKatsuki looks back up at Izuku’s face. For every time they’ve reached out to each other, he’s never felt quite so pathetic as he has in this moment. But he can’t bare the thought of pulling away again. If his younger self could see him now…\n\n“That’s not true. Because…” Izuku takes a deep breath. Suddenly, he’s giving Katsuki his best Hero Smile. “Because anal penetration feels really really good, right?!!”\n\n…Huh? Katsuki blinks.\n\nTakeshita gives a thumbs up. “No kink-shaming here, man!”\n\nGran Torino sips his drink. “It’s important to be yourself.”\n\nKurogiri shrugs. “There are weirder things to be into.”\n\nIzuku nods enthusiastically, letting go of his grip on Katsuki’s wrist. “Kacchan shouldn’t be embarrassed! He’s not the only one who likes anal!”\n\nKatsuki feels like his heart has stopped all over again. Actually— maybe this time it’s his brain.\n\nHe looks at the assembly of men in front of him— from his childhood friend, to the two semi-retired Pros, to a former villain— and thinks again that maybe he’s experiencing the world’s strangest pre-death dream.\n\nThe shock of Izuku’s bizarre attempt to comfort him flips some sort of reset button in his mind: “What are you doing feeling some camaraderie by yourself there, Deku? I’ll kill you.”\n\nHe’s not proud of how much he sounds like himself from middle school. But then again— he doesn’t have much to be proud of these, days.\n\nIzuku carries him back to their houses.\n\nKatsuki can hear him mumbling during the whole twenty-minute walk: “It’s hot. It’s heavy. Kacchan reeks of alcohol.” Katsuki’s good arm—the one that’s never been crushed by a villain— is slung around Izuku’s shoulders.\n\n“Hey, Kacchan, stop pulling on my shirt! Your alcohol tolerance is terrible.”\n\nKatsuki stumbles a bit. He’s sweating again. And he needs to piss. “Sh-shut up… I wanted to drink ‘till I forgot everything.” He hiccups. “All… everything…”\n\nIzuku sighs. “Here. We reached your house. Will you be okay from here?”\n\nKatsuki rights himself, pulling his arm back from around Izuku. It’s not fair that he’s such a mess, while Izuku, who drank almost as much as him, is fine. “‘M fine. Don’t look down on me.”\n\nIzuku rolls his eyes as he props Katsuki against his front door. “Okay, Kacchan. Drink some water. Goodnight.”\n\n“Tch. Night, Nerd.” Katsuki sways on his doorstep. He fumbles for his keys.\n\n“Oh— and Kacchan?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’m really really glad the surgery went well.”\n\n“… Me too.” Katsuki says with a sigh.\n\nIzuku heads into his own house. Katsuki presses his forehead against the front door and breaths deeply. He’s coming to accept that this is another thing he has no control over: He can’t stop Izuku from becoming quirkless, and he can’t go back in time and tell himself to stop ignoring his light-headedness and shortness of breath every time his heart rate spiked after working sixteen-hour shifts nonstop for two weeks straight. He can’t tell himself that Jeanist’s giant, comfy desk chair is a bad place to seek stress relief at three in the morning.\n\nKatsuki heaves another shuddering breath and pats his pockets. It’s just another thing that will haunt him for the rest of his life. Now, when he lies awake at night, wishing he had never treated Izuku so badly as a kid, he can also torture himself with the knowledge that Izuku (and everyone else) knows that he managed to stop his own heart while trying to fuck himself in the ass.\n\nHe feels around in his back pocket and realizes that it’s empty. Huh. He checks his front pockets and realizes that he only has his wallet and his phone. Shit. Why did he lock the door, anyways? It’s not like anyone was going to break in— Fuck, he needs to pee. Next door, he can see a light flick on inside Izuku’s house.\n\n“C’mon, c’mon.” He bounces from one foot to another. He can’t find his stupid keys anywhere.\n\n“Fuck. FUCK!” Katsuki shouts, banging on his own door. He’s sooo tired. And so drunk. And lately, it feels like no matter what he does, he just can’t fucking win.\n\nIzuku answers his doorbell.\n\nHe’s only been in his house for a couple weeks, so until this point, he hadn’t realized he had a doorbell. He’s lost in thought, not sure what to make of Kacchan being his next-door neighbor for the foreseeable future. I can’t believe Kacchan saw my Dynamight-themed dildo… I can’t believe the rumors about Kacchan’s hospitalization are true!\n\nThe doorbell rings again. Izuku startles. He stops his trek down the narrow hallway to his bedroom and turns back towards the front door he’d only just locked.\n\n“Wha—?” Izuku blinks as he pulls the door open. “Kacchan? Why are you still crying—?“ Then his eyes widen.\n\n“My keys… Not there…” The man Izuku has known since he was four years old sniffles, hiding his face in his elbow. “Toilet…I couldn’t make it in time…”\n\nKacchan is dripping on his front step. Izuku takes a step forward. His hand comes up, half in a placating gesture, half defensive. He wonders if he’s been slapped with a quirk that sent him into some bizarre alternate universe. Or if he’s had more to drink tonight than he thought he did, and it’s making him hallucinate.\n\nBut that doesn’t make sense, because the last couple days have been just as bizarre. Ever since Kacchan had shown up in the house next to his. Ever since he heard that Kacchan was in the hospital and he texted all of their friends, sick with worry— only to hear from Kaminari what had happened. Honestly, ever since that time in the hospital five years ago— when Kacchan had cried and told Izuku he’s thought that they’d be chasing after each other for the rest of their lives. Was that when things in Izuku’s life became weird?\n\nHe hadn’t been prepared to accept Kacchan’s tears, back then. Tenko’s death, the whole war— everything had happened so fast. Later, Izuku wished that he could go back and say something more reassuring; that he had been in the right headspace the understand what Kacchan was trying to communicate to him. At the time, Kacchan’s feelings had been too big— too unwieldy and heavy for Izuku to really understand. His own feelings back then were a complicated knot in his chest—one that he’s only just begun to unwind and process, years later. Still, just like the last time— Izuku is thrown through a loop.\n\nBecause nothing in the world could have prepared him for this.\n\n“I’ve lost all of my dignity. Twice. In one day.” Katsuki grumbles. He’s sitting on the floor in just his white button-up, leaning against Izuku’s couch. His pants and underwear are dangling from the clothes line on Izuku’s back porch. He’s got a bottle of wine positioned over his junk, but Izuku has placed a glass of water in his hands.\n\n“I don’t think I have any clean underwear…” Izuku mutters, going through a pile of laundry on his floor. “But it’s not like I can let Kacchan stay naked…” He hiccups.\n\n“Hey. ‘Zuku. This is from yesterday.” Katsuki’s face flushes as he holds up Izuku’s prized toy.\n\n“Ahh! Kacchan! That’s embarrassing! Stop touching it!”\n\nKatsuki ignores him. “What were you trying to make, anyway?” He holds the dildo upside-down between his thumb and pointer finger. It wobbles incriminatingly. Izuku’s face turns red.\n\n“…Mmh…” Izuku grabs the bottle of wine from between Katsuki’s legs and takes a swig.\n\nKatsuki howls with laughter when Izuku steps aside to reveal the dildo duct-taped to the front of the fan.\n\n“After attaching here, it was supposed to create a hands-free, spinning dildo, using the fan’s rotation.” Izuku mumbles. “Stop laughing!”\n\nKatsuki is crying again— though with laughter this time. He sounds a little unhinged, even to himself.\n\n“Ultimately the onahole and dildo would be removable…” Izuku mutters, darkly.\n\n“Haaaah! You have turned into a perv out here!” Katsuki barks. He leans back against the couch, still giggling. Izuku pouts, but he can’t help but be glad that Katsuki’s flush is from enjoyment at his humiliation, rather than Katsuki’s own.\n\n“Why not just get a partner, rather than relying on these things?” Katsuki tries to let curiosity distract him from his embarrassment.\n\n“We’re in the countryside Kacchan. Who am I supposed to partner up with?” Izuku asks, crawling towards him on the floor. He sets the bottle down on his coffee table.\n\nKatsuki looks up. “Ah, that’s fair.” He pauses. “Though it’s not like you have to stay out here in bum-fuck nowhere.” He mutters under his breath.\n\nIzuku sighs. “Kacchan… You know why I came here. The embers…”\n\n“Yeah, yeah.” Katsuki grumbles, waving his hand. “I don’t have to be happy about it though.”\n\nIzuku hums. He leans to his side, tipping over and brushing his shoulder against Katsuki’s. “At least you’re here now! I’m glad we can spend some time together, for a little while…”\n\nKatsuki’s cheeks redden. He sips his water. Then he says, nonchalantly: “So… you’re looking for a male partner, then?”\n\nIzuku stares at his oldest friend. Katsuki stares back. In all the years they’ve known each other, they’ve never even come close to talking about something like this. Izuku shrugs. “…I guess… if I had to choose…”\n\nKatsuki leans forward. Izuku swallows. “Uhh… I guess what I want is s-someone who w-will…” He trails off. Katsuki scowls. “Hah? Speak up, Nerd!”\n\n“Someone will dominate me and fuck me like hell!” Izuku yells. Then he covers his mouth with his hands, eyes wide.\n\n“…I get that.”\n\nIzuku opens his eyes. He blinks. Once. Then twice. Katsuki sits back against the sofa. He doesn’t make eye-contact. There’s a pretty blush sitting high on his cheek bones. Izuku swallows. His mouth feels dry— dusty from the liquor he’s been consuming for most of the evening. “S-Sometimes… you want to feel the real thing, right? Then you start wondering… ‘Eh? Do I really bend that way?’ or something…”\n\n“I- I see…” Katsuki stutters, looking away. “I… went to a place once… like a club… “ His cheeks darken. Izuku shuffles forward, hoping to catch what Katsuki is saying under his breath. “I couldn’t stand there watching and ran away though…”\n\n“Waaah! Kacchan went to a sex club? Wow…”\n\n“S-Shut up! I was curious…” Katsuki looks away.\n\nIzuku leans back so that he’s sitting on his calves. “Say…”\n\nKatsuki glances at him out of the corner of his eyes. He sips his drink. “…What?”\n\nIzuku twists the hem of his shirt in his hands. “Kacchan… that doctor you saw had a really strong quirk, right?”\n\nKatsuki raises his eyebrows at the non-sequitur, but he nods. “Yeah. Cellular regeneration, like that Katsuma kid from Nabu Island. I just need to avoid using my quirk for a little bit and then I’m basically good as new.”\n\nIzuku bobs his head up and down. “I thought so…” He murmurs. “Kacchan basically is only out here because he did naughty things at work. There’s no more danger to his heart.”\n\nKatsuki eyes Izuku suspiciously. “I mean, I still have to wear a monitor, just in case, but… pretty much, yeah… Where are you going with this, Nerd?”\n\n“Kacchan…” Izuku flushes. “What you did in Jeanist’s office…” He ignores the way Katsuki scowls at having his humiliation brought up again. “…the real thing is right in front of you. Do— Do you want to try it out?”\n\nA beat.\n\nKatsuki stares at Izuku with an unreadable expression. He puts his glass down. “Are— are you stupid, or what?” The blush starting at the tips of his ears begins spreads down his throat. He swallows.\n\nIzuku sits further back, bringing his legs to stretch out in front of him. They’re both red faced and quiet as they sit next to each other on Izuku’s floor. Katsuki’s eyes glance down at Izuku’s lap, just for a second, before darting back up to Izuku’s face. His cheeks burn. Izuku holds his breath.\n\nKatsuki’s eyes dart back down to Izuku’s crotch, before he turns his nose up with a sneer. “Don’t be stupid. I’m not losing my virginity to you.”\n\n“Ahh! Ahhh! Izuku…!” Katsuki moans. He’s lying on his back on Izuku’s futon. Sweat drips down his neck as he arches upwards. Izuku grips his thighs as he pushes into him, trying to set a rhythm with his hips.\n\nKatsuki tilts his head to the side, pressing his cheek to the pillow. “F-feels good… so hot…nnnngh… this is a first…”\n\n“K-Kacchan… haah…” Izuku pants. He can feel his own sweat sliding in droplets down his spine. His knees are beginning to hurt from kneeling on the ground for too long as he fucks into his childhood friend.\n\nKatsuki is needy. He writhes like a snake. It makes it hard for Izuku to control the pace. “More! Fuck me deeper!”\n\n“Haaah…” Izuku shakes his head like a dog trying to dry off. He can’t hide his amazement. “Kacchan is a total bottom after all…”\n\n“Sh-shut up!” Katsuki blushes. “Just shut up and move your thing…” He glares up at Izuku. His blonde hair splays against the futon. His nipples are pink and perky. His face is still red. Izuku looks down at him with wide eyes.\n\n“That’s some attitude—“ He says, canting his hips so that his cock pushes deeper into Katsuki’s hole. Katsuki screams.\n\n“Aaah! Ah! Aaaah!”\n\n“You’re really used to this.” Izuku muses aloud, as he thrusts in and out. “I wonder if that time in Jeanist’s office wasn’t the first time Kacchan has done something like this…”\n\n“Stop. I’ll kill you.”\n\n“How thick was the dick Kacchan was using?” Izuku asks. He angles his hips up, changing the trajectory of his cock just enough to have Katsuki moan and grab at the sheets near his head. “Thicker than mine?”\n\n“Y-yeah…”\n\n“Wow! Kacchan is a pro at taking it.” Izuku slides one hand down around Katsuki’s cock. He pumps his fist up and down, trying to time it with his hips. Precum beads from Katsuki’s tip, and Izuku uses it as lubricant as he jacks off the whining hero underneath him. He doesn’t quite manage to sync up his rhythm, but Katsuki moans anyways. “Which made you feel better?”\n\nKatsuki is blissed out on the mattress, but he opens his eyes at the question. “…mmmph”\n\n“Hah? Sorry Kacchan, I didn’t hear that? Which one?” Izuku spreads Katsuki’s legs so that he can sink in deeper. They both groan.\n\n“…”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“…My dildo!” Katsuki chokes out, eyes rolling back in his head.\n\n“Yeah, that’s— Wait. What?!” Izuku yelps. “What are you saying there?”\n\nKatsuki groans. He arches again, rolling his hips down to press Izuku further into him. “Tsk. That’s because… you’re bad at using your hips!”\n\nIzuku stops. Katsuki does not: “Also, asking about which feels better or thicker or something, you’re talking too much! It’s annoying! Just focus, Nerd!”\n\nIzuku stares at him. Then, he pulls out.\n\nKatsuki swears. “Fuck! Ahhh— wait!”\n\n“I’m gonna stop here…” Izuku pouts. He turns his back to Katsuki. “I’ll just do myself…”\n\n“Oi! Don’t stop half way! Take care of this until I come properly!” Katsuki shouts. His palm slaps the futon with a slight crackle. He’s not supposed to use his quirk, but he’s desperate.\n\n“Even still…” Izuku doesn’t face him. Katsuki stares incredulously at the back of his head. “I want a dick to go inside me…”\n\nKatsuki sits up on the futon, mouth agape. Izuku keeps pouting. “—But I thought that I wanted to make Kacchan feel good because you were feeling down. It’s my first time entering a guy so I’m trying my best here…” Izuku turns to look over his shoulder. His eyes are wet with unshed tears. “But I actually wanted to have a dick inside me!”\n\n“Erm… uh… Izuku… my bad…” Katsuki looks embarrassed. He sits up further. “I’ll— I’ll put it in you this time?”\n\nIzuku perks up like a rabbit. “Eh? For real?!”\n\nKatsuki closes his eyes. He breathes deeply through his nostrils. Izuku wonders if he’s doing some sort of meditation.\n\nFinally Katsuki opens his eyes, again, making direct contact with Izuku. “Yeah. I’ll fuck you. So. For now. Let’s continue this. Hurry up.” He pats the futon.\n\nIzuku beams. “It’s a promise!” He cries, diving back into bed.\n\nThe sounds of grasshoppers and chirping birds announce the morning. Katsuki and Izuku stand in their shared front yard, blinking at the sunrise. Izuku has both hands tucked under the waistband of his sweats. Katsuki scratches his balls.\n\n“Why do I feel so refreshed even though I just lost my virginity?” Katsuki muses.\n\nIzuku shrugs. “I don’t know Kacchan. I would never have guess you were a virgin from the way to took my—“\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nThey both stand in front of the weird-looking little jizo statue. A cool breeze makes the tall grass undulate in waves.\n\n“So how was it?” Izuku asks, squinting into the morning sunlight.\n\nKatsuki sucks in a breath. Izuku turns his head to look at him, curious.\n\n“RAW DICK IS LIFE!” Katsuki yells suddenly, making Izuku jump. In a nearby tree, a flock of birds takes off.\n\n“Uh… you’re welcome, Kacchan.” Izuku grins.\n\nKatsuki brings his fists up like a boxer. “Okay. Fuck this brooding shit. It was a dream to think everything would stay the same and I’d keep my bad-ass life without any setbacks. I’ll just ignore the rumors and focus on recovery, and then go back to the city and kick some ass!” He stares off into the middle distance, determined. Then his lips curl into a sneer. “And then I’ll find out who blabbed to everyone about how I ended up in the hospital… and I’ll kill ‘em.”\n\nIzuku laughs. “Okay Kacchan.” He crouches down, picking a stick up off the ground and twirling it in his fingers. “I don’t really care about being a badass, I guess. I just want a happy life. One where everyone feels safe.” Izuku starts using the stick to write something in the dirt.\n\n“Not a bad plan, Nerd.” Katsuki grins. “Okay. Here’s what we’re gonna do. I’ll make a full recovery, and we’ll leave this hellhole, together.”\n\nIzuku nods. He looks up at Katsuki, determined. “And I’ll figure out what to do without the embers! Maybe I'll get a job…”\n\nKatsuki winces, but covers it up by sinking down quickly into a crouch next to Izuku. “Move back to the city…Get a lover…”\n\nIzuku nods. His eyes are focused on the dirt in front of him. “…And every day…”\n\n“Every day?” Katsuki questions. Izuku turns to him, and his smile makes Katsuki’s heart skip a beat.\n\n“Everyday.” He nods, holding his hand up. Katsuki clasps it in his own.\n\n“We get ourselves butt-fucked!” They say at the same time, before falling over with laughter.\n\nThe sound of their giggles echoes over the countryside. The absurdity of everything—Izuku losing his quirk, Katsuki tanking his career— both of them being total bottoms. Their lives look nothing like they’d thought they would, at the beginning of their first year at UA. But still. Here they are— howling their asses off at six in the morning in a god-forsaken corner of Japan. Together. If the weird looking beak-head of jizo statue in front of them could smile, it probably would be.\n\nIzuku claps a hand on his shoulder. Katsuki wipes a tear from the corner of his eye. He sits up and looks at what Izuku had written in the dirt.\n\n“Happy Life.”\n\nA bird flaps overhead, dropping something from the sky. It splats on the ground, right in the middle of Izuku’s writing.\n\nTheir laughter finally peters out.\n\n“Ah.”\n\n“Huh.”\n\n“It reads ‘shitty life’ now…”"
