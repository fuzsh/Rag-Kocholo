Subscribe to Urban List's entertainment newsletter The Binge right here.\n\nA sure-fire way to ruin the perfect night on the couch is having to waste your precious binge time searching for the perfect flick. Fortunately, Stan is packed with a bunch of epic blockbusters.\n\nTo ensure you can start smashing the popcorn sooner, we’ve rounded up the very best movies on Stan right now. Happy bingeing.\n\nTransfusion\n\nStarring Sam Worthington (Avatar), Phoebe Tonkin (Bloom) and Matt Nable (The Dry and Poker Face), Transfusion is a taut, muscular Aussie thriller that follows former special forces operative, Ryan Logan (Worthington). Battling to cope with life after the loss of his wife, Logan is suddenly thrust into the criminal underworld to keep his only son from being taken from him. Watch it from January 20.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\nLet's be honest, 2018 was a damn good time. Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra tied the knot, Ariana released Thank U, Next and everyone was dancing to Drake's In My Feelings challenge. We were also gifted, the absolute knockout, film of the decade—Crazy Rich Asians. The movie was, and still is, prolific for a number of reasons; it gave agency to female characters, flipped the traditional Asian rom-com trope on its head and was the first all-Asian cast produced by Hollywood since 90s drama The Joy Luck Club. We could really harp on for hours, maybe days, about this one but if you're just here for the summary, here goes.\n\nBased on the outrageously funny novel by Kevin Kwan of the same name, Crazy Rich Asians is a rom-com whereby Rachel Chu heads to her boyfriend's best friend's wedding in Singapore. On arrival, she realises that her boyfriend's family is richer than rich; and he's considered one of Singapore's most eligible bachelors. This one never gets old. Watch it here.\n\nA Star Is Born\n\nWe mean, this one needs no introduction. Whether you've watched it a million times already or are yet to witness the on-screen magic of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, A Star Is Born is a timeless piece of art. There are many reasons why this movie trumps all others but most notably, A Star Is Born made Lady-G the first woman in history to nab up an Academy Award, Grammy, BAFTA and Golden Globe in a single year for her contribution on the soundtrack for the movie. Watch it here.\n\nMother\n\nNothing says Friday movie night quite like a psychological horror film. Enter Darren Aronofsky's Mother, the 2017 messed-up flick starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. In this one, a poet and his wife live a tranquil life in a burnt-out house. However, when uninvited guests come barging in, the couple's life turns chaotic and shocking events unfold. We love this one because of its powerful allegory (real movie nerds will know), where Bardem's character is seemingly staged as 'God', Lawrence's character is staged as 'Mother Earth' and the house represents the environment. Good stuff. Watch it here.\n\nZero Dark Thirty\n\nWe know this movie doesn’t need an introduction but here it is anyway. Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatisation of the decade-long tracking of Osama Bin Laden and is essentially two hours and thirty minutes of action gold, a war thriller directed by the Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow. Watch it here.\n\nA Ghost Story\n\nFrom A24 comes A Ghost Story, a meditative and poetic film deeply entrenched within the legacy of loss, life and basically what it means to be human. After he’s shot, a husband (Casey Affelck) returns to his suburban home as a white-sheet ghost, unstuck in time and forced to passively watch his wife (Rooney Mara) embark on life without him. Watch it here.\n\nSilent Night\n\nIt feels like a damn millenum since we saw Kiera Knightley grace our screens (unless of course you got all around the 20th anniversary of Bend It Like Beckham this year) but fear not, she British legend stars in this relatively new horror meets comedy. In this film, a couple invites their closest friends to join their family for an indulgent Christmas dinner inside their dreamy English countryside home. However, all isn't as it seems *plays suspensful music* as outside, the world is facing an impending apocayptic doom. Watch it here.\n\nInto The Wild\n\nIf you've never watched Into The Wild, you are in for a treat. Christopher McCandless is a young graduate who decides to renounce all his possessions, his trust fund and his stable family to hitchhike across America and deep into the Alaskan wilderness. Beautifully shot and inspired by the 1996 novel of the same name, this one is actually based on a true story too. Spoiler—have some tissues handy. Watch Into The Wild here.\n\nChanging Lanes\n\nIf you've never watched Changing Lanes before, now is the time. Starring Ben Afleck and Samuel L. Jackson, this movie follows a young Wall Street lawyer and a recovering alcoholic as they're both racing to get to court on time. The two get into a crash with each other, resulting in some pretty major consequences for both. From here, the two decide to get revenge on each other. Watch Changing Lanes here.\n\nFootloose (2011)\n\nFootloose is all about the timeless struggle between innocence and morality, when city-boy Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon) finds himself in an uptight Midwestern town where dancing has been banned. Ren revolts with best friend Willard (Chris Penn) and the minister's daughter (Lori Singer). The musical score is also next level with a treasury of 'Top 10' songs—Footloose, Dancing In The Sheets, Let's Hear It For The Boy, Holding Out for A Hero and the Footloose love theme Almost Paradise. Watch Footloose (2011) here.\n\nZoolander 2\n\nWe're just going to assume you're all across Zoolander. After being in isolation for years, Derek and Hansel find themselves recruited by Interpol to unearth the mystery behind the assassinations of prominent celebrities from all over the world. Arguably not as funny as the first Zoolander but hey, she's still a goodie. Watch Zoolander 2 here.\n\nGold\n\nOkay people, if you haven’t kicked your heels up to watch the Stan Original that is all the rave right now, you’re doing yourself a disservice. Gold is led by an all-star cast featuring Zac Efron, Susie Porter and Anthony Hayes. The thriller is about greed and the lengths people will go to secure themselves a fortune—two drifters stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found in the desert and they hatch a plan to protect and excavate their find with one man leaving to grab all gear needed to strip it from the ground. As for the other guy? Well, he gets the glorious task of enduring harsh elements, wild dogs and intruders while he waits for his mate to get back. Lovely.\n\nJustice League\n\nDC fans amp up because Justice League will see all of your favourite superheroes come together for one seriously action-packed film. In this flick Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Bruce Wayne, aka Batman (Ben Affleck) join forces to work against the evil Steppenwolf, and his attempt to destroy humanity. But the duo can’t do it alone, so they turn to their fellow superheroes for help—The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). Expect mind-blowing action scenes and the ultimate battle of good versus evil.\n\nNightcrawler\n\nNightcrawler is a psychological thriller that you’ll be hard pressed to tear yourself away from. It follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a driven man desperate for work, who eventually muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism. But soon his hunger for a good story grows too large and he begins to blur the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV news veteran who will stop at nothing to be the number news anchor in the country.\n\nNitram\n\nThe first Australian film to be selected for Official Competition at the Cannes Film Festival in a decade (with Caleb Landry Jones winning Best Actor honours for his performance), Nitram depicts the events leading up to one of the darkest chapters in Australian history in an attempt to understand why and how this atrocity occurred. It features an all-star Aussie cast including Caleb Landry Jones, Essie Davis, Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia.\n\nFantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\n\nFantastic Beasts follows the adventures of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York’s secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.

But when Obscurus, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children when their abilities are suppressed, threatens to destroy magic and all of humanity, Newt—and his sidekicks—must band together to save the world.\n\nNeedle In A Timestack\n\nNeedle in a Timestack is a gripping, near-future love story directed by Oscar winner John Ridley. It follows Nick and Janine (Leslie Odom, Jr. and Cynthia Erivo) who live in marital bliss, until Janine’s ex-husband (Orlando Bloom) warps time to try to tear them apart using Nick’s college girlfriend (Frieda Pinto). As Nick’s memories and reality disappear, he must decide what he’s willing to sacrifice in order to hold onto—or let go of—everything he loves.\n\nSilk Road\n\nInspired by actual events, this crime thriller follows young and idealistic Ross Ulbricht (played by Love, Simon’s Nick Robinson), who creates the internet’s first unregulated marketplace on the darknet: Silk Road. But when the site becomes a multimillion dollar pipeline for illicit drugs, Ulbricht draws the attention of Rick Bowden, a dangerously unpredictable DEA agent who uses any means necessary to take him down.\n\nMinari\n\nWritten and directed by the incredible Lee Isaac Chung and nominated for a whopping six Oscars in 2020, Minari is one of the best movies on Stan right now.

However, even the Jaegers are not enough to defeat the Kaiju, and humanity is on the verge of defeat. Mankind's last hope now lies with a washed-up ex-pilot (Charlie Hunnam), an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) and an old, obsolete Jaeger.\n\nSupernova\n\nThis heart-wrenching film will hit you right in the feels.
