        "text": "Organised crime, baby – there are few premises more seductive to the movies than the power struggles, turf wars, and moral quandaries of the mob. The best gangster movies are slickly entertaining, endlessly stylish, and a worthy addition to a genre which boasts some of the most iconic films in our cinematic history.\n\nTo settle the debate we've compiled the top 15 gangster movies, from the obvious ones you’d be hard-pressed not to find on your film bro friends’ Letterboxd top 4, but also some more unconventional, unsung classics. Say hello to our little friends.\n\n15. King of New York (1990)\n\nThe Robin Hood story is a natural inspiration point for so many films about organised crime – a little crew of guys dabbling in criminality with the view, however warped it may be, that they're balancing the scales and restoring some order between the elite and those on the streets. King of New York riffs on that inspiration directly, with Christopher Walken playing a drug kingpin using his nefarious empire to pay for a hospital for poor people. Back it all up with a supporting cast of Laurence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes and it-boy turned CSI sunglass meme guy David Caruso, you've got a peak 90s mafioso movie going. You can watch King of New York on Amazon.\n\n14. True Romance (1993)\n\nThere are gangster movies where you're in the belly of the beast of a mafia organisation, and then there are others where you end up on its fringes with a protagonist getting sucked into its threatening orbit. True Romance – the Quentin Tarantino-written, Tony Scott-directed film starring Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette – is just that. A down-on-their-luck waster and call girl get embroiled in a big drug deal when they accidentally steal a bag full of cocaine, and end up on the run from a group of gangsters wanting their score back. It's the finest love story ignited by a raging police vs mobster shoot-out you'll ever witness. You can watch True Romance on Amazon.\n\n13. The Irishman (2019)\n\nA gangster list without a hefty heap of Scorsese is like a Scorsese film without “Gimme Shelter”: unimaginable and also probably illegal. Late-stage gangster Scorsese was cooking with gas when he brought Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci back together for The Irishman, a decades-spanning, almost four-hour-long marathon epic about a man's come-up in the Philadelphia mob. Sure, the de-ageing technology is fairly distracting (we know what young Bobby D looked like!), as are De Niro's blue contact lenses. But there's something about seeing these maestros all back together doing what they do best that makes you want to stand up and salute. You can watch The Irishman on Netflix.\n\n12. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nPulp Fiction is undeniable. It revived John Travolta and Bruce Willis's flubbing careers and made superstars out of Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman. There's so much at play in Quentin Tarantino's overlapping, multi-narrative epic, but perhaps its most enduring legacy is Travolta and Jackson's exhausted hitmen just trying to make it through their day without getting killed. You can watch Pulp Fiction on ITVX.\n\n11. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)\n\nGuy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels put him on the map, gave us Vinnie Jones (actor) and put the modern London gangster film on the map. It follows a hapless group of guys in debt to the mob who need to pull off a bank heist to save their necks (or at least their fingers). Even in its earliest, pupa stage, Ritchie's hallmark of geezers bantering, swear words given a cockney flourish and gun barrel POV swing shots were strong and exhilarating. You can watch Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels on Amazon.\n\n10. The Godfather (1972)\n\nSurprise, surprise! But it would actually be criminal to not pay our respects to The Godfather, first and foremost. Appearing on every Greatest Films Of All Time list ever made, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather is the gangster movie. A titan of cinema with the kind of immense legacy few other films can lay claim to, it follows the Corleones and its patriarch as they conduct the sprawling family business of crime, love, war, violence, Italians. You know it well. You can watch The Godfather on Amazon.\n\n9. Oldboy (2003)\n\nPark Chan-wook’s Oldboy might not immediately come to mind when you think ‘gangster movie’, because it’s told from the perspective of the man who’s been psychologically tortured by unknown captors for 15 years, locked up in a hotel room, and fed the same dumplings every single day for reasons unknown to him. But when he is suddenly released, he’s hellbent on getting answers and revenge: and that lands him squarely in a web of violent crime that, among other things, sees him beat the shit out of dozens of gangsters in a narrow corridor in one of cinema’s greatest fight scenes of all time. You can watch Oldboy on Mubi.\n\n8. Bound (1996)\n\n“I want out,” says gangster’s moll Violet, a deliciously subversive femme fatale played by poker legend and scream queen Jennifer Tilly in the Wachowskis’ exhilarating debut feature, Bound. A lesbian neo-noir that follows two lovers who hatch a plan to steal from the mob, buying their way out of its web of macho violence, this is a stylish mafia tale told from the perspective of those who want to break free from its chains. One of the sexiest movies ever made. You can watch Bound on BFI.\n\n7. Goodfellas (1990)\n\nAnother heavy hitter in the gangster movie pantheon, Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas has become synonymous with that iconic trio of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci – and is considered by many to be the best film Scorsese has ever made. Telling the true story of Henry Hill, a young man in Brooklyn who makes it his mission to climb his way up the ranks of the Sicilian mafia. This mob masterpiece is utterly exhilarating from start to finish. De Niro says it best: “C’mon, fuckos, let’s go for a ride!” You can watch Goodfellas on Amazon.\n\n6. Le Samourai (1967)\n\nCool, slick, and as dispassionate as a shark, Jean-Pierre Melville’s ultra-stylish Le Samourai stars Alain Delon as Jef Costello, a professional hitman attempting to unveil the identity of his unknown employers while the police close in on him. Painted in stark tones with the dramatic contrast of a graphic novel, Le Samourai is a film of few words – but its breathtaking style, cold gaze, and killer instinct cuts deep. You can watch Le Samourai on Amazon.\n\n5. Infernal Affairs (2002)\n\nHell yes, hell yes: Hong Kong makes some of the best mafia movies we have the wicked pleasure of enjoying, and Infernal Affairs is one of them. Starring Andy Lau and Tony Leung, Infernal Affairs follows two young men caught unknowingly in each other’s orbit: one, a police officer gone undercover in the mafia, and the other, a young mafia member who’s infiltrated the police. Martin Scorsese would go on to remake this enthralling premise in 2006’s The Departed, but you should seek out the OG’s beguiling and surprisingly moving beauty for itself. You can watch Infernal Affairs on Amazon.\n\n4. As Tears Go By (1988)\n\nAnother Andy Lau gangster movie! But Wong Kar-Wai’s directorial debut, As Tears Go By, is here for a much different reason: sometimes, gangsters really are just losers. Forget the glamour and the slickness, because this rough-around-the-edges small fry mob story is intimate and steeped in humanity, and a reminder that good filmmaking is all about making the smallest of stakes feel utterly engrossing. Plus, Andy Lau very much makes the case for gangsters wearing very short shorts! You can watch As Tears Go By on BFI.\n\n3. The Untouchables (1987)\n\nStyle maverick Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables lands us in the Prohibition era, right in the backyard of infamous gangster Al Capone – and the ragtag team of police officers assembled to try and bring him to justice. They give themselves a very cool name, which is also the name of the film, and no matter which side of the “Is Kevin Costner Good Or Terrible In This Movie?” debate you subscribe to, it’s undeniably fun to watch. You can watch The Untouchables on Amazon.\n\n2. Eastern Promises (2007)\n\nIn quite a different vein from the body horror that David Cronenberg’s name has become synonymous with, Eastern Promises is the renowned Canadian auteur’s mafia film – and though an outlier in his oeuvre, some Cronenberg fans get behind this one as one of his best. Turning the director’s penchant for incredibly visceral gore away from sci-fi and towards the gritty realisation of Russian mafia violence in London, Eastern Promises is touted as one of the most realistic, detailed, and thrilling gangster films of all time. It follows a midwife who finds herself ensnared in Russian mafia activity after delivering the baby of a teenager who dies during childbirth, leaving clues to her rapist in her wake. You can watch Eastern Promises on Amazon.\n\n1. Election (2005)\n\nMob politics have never been more enthralling than in Johnnie To’s Election, which finds two gang leaders in a power struggle attempting to become the chairman of the Wo Lin Shing gangster triad. Wildly entertaining, it is also an incisive commentary on the way democracy, tradition, and honour are mere ideals that ring hollow in the face of brute force and greed – a bleak microcosm of the devious way power operates in all forms of governments, mafia and otherwise. You can watch Election on Mubi."
