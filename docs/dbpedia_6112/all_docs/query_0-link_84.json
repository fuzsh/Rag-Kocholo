        "text": "Have you long thought “I would go to more movies if I could bring my dog”?\n\nNow’s your chance.\n\nMiddlebury filmmaker Andy Knight Mitchell is marking the release of his new documentary, “Inside the Mind of a Dog,” by inviting those attending to bring their dogs to a free screening. If enough dogs show up Saturday, Aug. 10, at the town hockey rink – 220 or more canines and their people, to be precise – Middlebury will set an official Guinness World Record for (yes, this is a category) “Most dogs to attend a film screening.”\n\nThe 4 p.m. screening is presented by Middlebury Underground, a nonprofit arts and event organization co-founded by Mitchell.\n\n“We’re partnering with the Better Middlebury Partnership, and Homeward Bound Animal Shelter,” Mitchell wrote in an email to the Burlington Free Press. “Together we’re looking to break a World Record, raise awareness, and have a great time doing it!” For those who pre-register, the day will include free popcorn, dog treats and giveaways.\n\nThe documentary, as the title suggests, looks at what goes on in the heads of the world’s most popular pet. Narrated by Rob Lowe, “Inside the Mind of a Dog” premieres Friday, Aug. 9 on Netflix.\n\nRules for dog (and people) obedience\n\nThe dogs attending the potential record-breaking screening will not be free-range dogs. There are numerous rules that dogs and their people must obey to qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records:\n\nDogs must be leashed at all times. Crates may not be used.\n\nDogs must be accompanied by a handler at least 16 years old, with one dog per handler.\n\nResist the temptation to gussy up your dog for an evening on the town; no clothes, dyed hair or accessories are allowed.\n\nDogs must be at least 1 year old.\n\nDogs and their people need to be in place for 10 minutes during the movie screening.\n\nDogs must all be very good boys and girls. Those with aggressive histories will not be allowed to attend.\n\nDogs must have current licenses and vaccines.\n\nOwners must clean up all dog waste.\n\nNo stopping to smell the roses or those less-pleasant-smelling things dogs like to sniff; those arriving late will not be counted in the record attempt.\n\nIf you go\n\nWHAT: Attempt to set a world record for most dogs to attend a movie screening, for the documentary “Inside the Mind of a Dog” by Middlebury filmmaker Andy Knight Mitchell.\n\nWHEN: 4 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\nWHERE: Memorial Sports Center (town hockey rink), Middlebury.\n\nINFORMATION: Free; pre-registration is highly recommended. www.middunderground.org.\n\nContact Brent Hallenbeck at bhallenbeck@freepressmedia.com."
