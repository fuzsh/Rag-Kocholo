        "text": "Being a hero is about a lot of things.\n\nIt’s about appearances, for one. Establishing a brand, maintaining a strong public image, things like that. There are heroes who excel at that part of the job, those like Mt. Lady and Best Jeanist, and there are heroes who prefer to keep a low profile, those like Eraser Head and Manual. To be a Pro Hero is to be a celebrity in some capacity, so it’s no wonder there are people who fall on both ends of the spectrum of fame.\n\nOchako Uraraka isn’t really sure where she lands on that spectrum.\n\nShe wouldn’t call herself unpopular, no. Most everyone knows who she is and like her well enough. She was one of the key players in taking down the uprising of villains that threatened to bring the world to ruin, she’s got a nice, family friendly image that resonates well with children, and she dated the one and only Deku. Her fame had dwindled over the years like most of her former classmates’ had, though. She still got approached whenever she went out grocery shopping, sure, but there weren’t any crowds clamoring for autographs every time she stepped outside or anything like that.\n\nIt’s about upholding the greater good. Fighting crime, evacuating civilians when disaster strikes, providing relief after said disasters pass. Rescue heroes like Thirteen are good at that. She can clear away rubble like it’s nothing and soothe distressed children with the calming sound of her voice alone. These are the heroes that dedicate themselves to righteousness, who walk a path of purity in the name of justice, peace, honor, all that good stuff.\n\nOchako doesn’t think she fits in with those types.\n\nShe should, on paper. She’s got a squeaky clean image, is known more for saving lives than she is for punching bad guys, and can definitely stand on the same plane as those heroes in terms of how much they’ve accomplished. But she’s no paragon of virtue. She isn’t pure and good in the way they are, or at least the way they pretend to be. She can’t be. Not after everything that’s happened.\n\nIt’s about saving people. Protecting the vulnerable from harm and rescuing those who’ve already been hurt. At the end of the day, what good is being a hero if you aren’t actually helping anyone? To defend, to rescue, to be that beacon of light that ushers people out from the darkness. That’s what it’s all about, isn’t it?\n\nOchako is good at that.\n\nOr at least, she likes to think she is.\n\nShe’s a rescue hero for the most part these days, and a good one at that. She’s run through a dozen burning buildings and effortlessly tossed aside more tons of rubble and debris than she can count in her time. She’s performed gravity-defying leaps up skyscrapers to reach people no on else could, she’s crawled through narrow tunnels to clear away the rubble trapping miners after a cave-in, hell, she’s stopped a landslide from decimating a village all on her own.\n\nHelping people was part of why Ochako wanted to become a hero in the first place—that, and the money, of course. She would watch heroes like All Might perform incredible feats of strength and tenacity and bring smiles to a hundred faces just like that. That’s what she wanted to do. To help people, to save people, to make people smile.\n\nThat’s why Himiko Toga is sitting in the passenger seat of her car.\n\nSmall, useless worries creep at the back of Ochako’s mind as she drives, both hands on the wheel and eyes forward. How would the public react if they knew that Uravity of all people is taking in Himiko Toga, the serial killer who’d been right by Tomura Shigaraki’s side as he attempted to raze Japan to the ground? Someone like her could never be the sort of morally upright symbol every hero ought to strive to be. She’s supposed to be a hero who saved people, so just what is she thinking harboring a monster like Himiko Toga?\n\nExcept Himiko isn’t a monster. They don’t know that, of course. Ochako can count on one hand the people who do. Not her old classmates that she’s talked about Himiko with time and time again, no, but people who actually know the girl behind the knife.\n\nThere’s Tsuyu, for one. She took the time to get to know her after the war, after Ochako had practically begged her to. She was wary at first, but she and Himiko had become friends over the years, even if they could only ever speak through a window and every word they said to each other was recorded.\n\nThere’s Deku, too, but that shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. His heart’s always been more open to accepting those others would reject without a second thought. It’s part of what Ochako loves about him. They would visit Himiko together when they could, early on, but visitation in Tartarus is hard to get no matter who you are. It’s a place for the most dangerous villains in the country to be locked away forever, after all, so unimportant visits from friends aren’t exactly something the leadership is eager to authorize.\n\nThere’s Spinner and Mr. Compress, but they aren’t allowed any communication with each other, and Ochako can’t imagine that will change anytime soon. It took this long for Himiko to be granted her freedom, and any violation of that mandate is sure to get her locked right back up with the key thrown away. There wouldn’t be any salvation for her then.\n\nTwice knew Himiko well, from what she’s told Ochako. Dabi and Shigaraki, too.\n\nThey’re gone now.\n\nThat leaves Ochako, who from her own point of view has been Himiko’s biggest ally these past five years. It’s because of her persistent lobbying that Himiko was released to begin with, albeit on strict probation. She’s been the one visiting her once a month all these years, and if she’d been allowed to do so more frequently, she would have in a heartbeat.\n\nHimiko hasn’t said a word since she walked through that prison door dressed in plainclothes and met Ochako’s eyes without a barrier between them for the first time in what felt like an eternity. She kept her gaze on her feet as Ochako led her to the car. She’s been staring out the window this whole time as the two of them sit together in silence, a silence that’s begun to eat away at Ochako after nearly an hour of driving.\n\nShe gets it, of course. Himiko’s been through a lot and she can’t expect her to be cheerful after all of it. Two years in Tartarus—solitary confinement—and another three at a maximum security prison somewhere along the coast. They’d cited good behavior as the reason for her transfer, but Ochako knows Himiko’s docility had nothing to do with it. Information had somehow leaked about the facility’s unethical standards and practices, and transferring Himiko out must have been their way of convincing the public that they weren’t completely irredeemable. It was a show of good faith, apparently. The next step was mostly Ochako’s doing, using every connection she had and leveraging her name and influence to get Himiko’s sentence reduced as much as she could. She’d had too many meetings with too many defense attorneys and other men in suits, but all those hours spent stressed out and hunched over legal documents were worth it, because Himiko is finally here, by Ochako’s side, just as she should be.\n\nYet, Ochako seems more excited about it than Himiko does.\n\nThey come to rest at a traffic light, the first one in a while since they’ve mostly been on the expressway. Ochako’s apartment isn’t too far now, and she figures that if she doesn’t want the drive back to have been spent entirely in silence, now is as good a time to talk as any.\n\n“So, how do you feel?” is the question she decides to ask.\n\nHimiko barely moves, her eyes only briefly flicking over to look at Ochako as she gives a little shrug. “Tired,” she says.\n\n“It’s no wonder. I’d be tired too if I had to go through everything you have. But don’t worry, you can rest as much as you want now. I’ve got a really nice futon ready for you when we get back.”\n\nShe expects some reaction, and when she receives none, her smile falters.\n\n“Himiko…”\n\nShe doesn’t know how to continue. What is there to say? There are so many things she wants to talk about, so many things Himiko’s missed over the years, but her own desires can wait. Ochako has to be tactful here and she knows it.\n\n“You’re free now,” she says. Her voice is as soft as it can be without it becoming a whisper.\n\n“Am I?” Himiko asks, and Ochako’s attention falls to the silver band locked around her ankle. It’s sleek and unobtrusive, but that doesn’t really matter when it is what it is. “I can’t leave the city. I can’t talk to my friends. I can’t be alone in public. I have to check in with that stupid officer every other day. I’m still just a prisoner to them.”\n\nBitterness coats her words, and Ochako has to admit it stings a little. It isn’t that she’s looking for gratitude or anything—Himiko doesn’t know how much Ochako’s done for her, because she wasn’t permitted to know so long as she was still imprisoned—but in the weeks leading up to Himiko’s release, all Ochako’d been able to think about was finally getting to see her favorite sight again.\n\nHimiko’s smile.\n\nThat’s what had captivated her back when she was still a student, that smile of hers like a siren’s song luring sailors to their deaths. Ochako had gotten hurt for it and she had the scar to prove it, but in the aftermath, she still hasn’t been able to get it out of her head. The way Himiko’s catlike eyes light up, the way her lips pull back to show off those sharp teeth, the way the corners of her mouth turn up farther than they should be able to. It’s beautiful. It’s always been beautiful, and Ochako sees it every time she goes to sleep. It makes her heart full and her chest tight. It makes her feel like she’s floating, as if she’s under the effects of her own quirk. It makes her want to put a smile on Himiko’s face every day for the rest of her life, to stay by her side forever and give her the affection she’s always deserved but was so cruelly denied, to make her truly happy—\n\nOchako is pretty sure she’s in love with her. But she came to terms with that a while ago.\n\n“It isn’t forever, Himiko,” Ochako says, and she isn’t sure if it makes things any better. “It’s only a year. And I’m sure that we can get that reduced, too.”\n\n“Why do you sound so sure?”\n\n“Because you were released after serving only five years of a life sentence. You were strong enough to get through that, so I know you’ll get through this, too.”\n\nHimiko winces as the light changes and Ochako continues driving. She can’t help but wonder about that look in her eyes, though, the one that makes her think maybe Himiko was subjected to treatment even worse that she’s imagined. That thought scares her, so she pushes it aside. Later, maybe.\n\n“Is there… anything you want to know?” Ochako asks. It’s better to move their conversation in a different direction. “There must be. I mean, they kept a lot of information from you for so long. Ask away.”\n\nThe moments pass by in silence. Ochako is patient, so she waits, but she starts to think that Himiko is done talking after a while. That’s when Himiko responds.\n\n“Is everyone doing okay?”\n\nIt’s a loaded question, and one that Ochako doesn’t quite understand the full extent of. Who does she mean by “everyone?”\n\n“Ah, yeah! Tsu started her own agency earlier this year, actually. It’s pretty small right now, but she wants to partner up with some water-themed heroes so it can grow. I haven’t heard anything about Mr. Compress in a while, but Spinner’s still working on his book. He’s been doing pretty alright, I think.”\n\n“Izuku?”\n\nOchako’s lips press together at that. It’s okay. She can dance around this subject.\n\n“Really busy,” she says with a weak little laugh. “I thought I did a lot of activism, but that’s pretty much his whole life outside of teaching. He’s always travelling someplace or other for conferences or to give speeches or something. I don’t see him much these days.”\n\n“You must be lonely.”\n\n“I’m not,” Ochako replies, perhaps a little too quickly. “I keep myself busy enough to not really have time to feel lonely. Besides, I make it a point to meet up with Momo and the girls every now and then. Mina’s been really good about making sure the group stays together even now that we’re out of school.”\n\n“That’s nice,” Himiko mumbles, sinking further into her seat. “… What kind of activism do you do?”\n\nOchako silently curses herself. She let that slip, huh?\n\nNow isn’t the right time. Himiko doesn’t need to be told about all the work Ochako’s been doing to help her—she’s smart enough to have figured it out by now anyway. She was supposed to spend the rest of her life locked away in a cell away from society and instead was released after only five years, with one of the many stipulations of her release being that she’s only permitted to be housed with her parole officer, a selection of supposed experts in villain affairs, or Ochako Uraraka. That Ochako was involved is clear as day, but there’s no need for Himiko to know the details right now. Ochako knows it would just make her feel guilty.\n\nApparently she takes too long to answer. Himiko mumbles a quiet “Thank you,” and casts her gaze down at her lap.\n\nHer face is the very image of misery, and it feels like barbed chains wrapped around Ochako’s heart. She hates seeing her like this. She’s hated seeing her like this for years. Himiko should be positively glowing, golden eyes gleaming like twin suns in the sky, teeth shining like the moon at its brightest. That’s the Himiko met as a teenager, that’s the Himiko she fell in love with. The cutest girl in the world with the cutest smile.\n\nAnd they’ve chased that smile away.\n\nOchako has cried for her before, on those nights she can’t get Himiko out of her head. She’s imagined the sort of pain she must have endured in Tartarus, all alone save for the watchful eye of whoever it was behind the cameras that recorded her every move. She didn’t have to imagine what Himiko had went through at the second prison because there, she’d been allowed to actually tell her, and every word out of her mouth made Ochako’s blood boil. Cruel inmates, abusive guards—and even then, Ochako knew she was never getting the full details. She could see it in Himiko’s eyes, more and more wrought with despair every visit.\n\nFor a brief moment, Ochako wonders if she’ll ever see Himiko smile again. It doesn’t take long for her to realize how stupid she’s being. Of course she will. Himiko is strong. She’ll recover from this, and Ochako will be there to help her every step of the way if she needs it. She won’t abandon her. She won’t give on her like others have. She doesn’t care what anyone else thinks, because Himiko Toga is worth saving.\n\n“Well, here we are!”\n\nOchako’s apartment is nothing worth bragging about, but she doesn’t let that stop her from presenting it to Himiko like it’s a luxury hotel suite. It’s modest and comfortable, even if it isn’t the prettiest thing to look at. There isn’t much in the way of décor outside of a few framed photos on the walls and around the living room, photos of memories Ochako holds dear.\n\nThere’s one of her in tears on the day of her graduation, diploma in hand, surrounded by the other girls from her class. There’s one of her in costume posing next to a sick child who’d wanted nothing more than to meet his favorite hero before his hourglass ran out. There’s another of her Deku smiling at the camera from the peak of Mt. Fuji on their second anniversary.\n\nLooking at that one always stokes a bit of sadness in Ochako’s chest. She hopes Himiko doesn’t pay it any mind.\n\nHimiko adjusts the strap of her bag over her shoulder and gives the place a once over. She seems unimpressed.\n\n“You live here?” she asks, though she already knows the answer.\n\n“Yeah! Sorry it’s not exactly the nicest place out there. I haven’t put much effort into decorating it since I don’t really spend a lot of time here, haha. It’s mostly just the place where I sleep and watch TV sometimes.”\n\nHimiko raises an eyebrow at that, and Ochako is quick to reassure her. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. That futon I mentioned really is high quality, so I promise you’ll be comfortable. Or if you want, we can go out shopping this weekend and buy a bed frame and mattress. How’s that sound?”\n\n“It isn’t a good idea to go out in public with me,” Himiko says, stepping farther into the apartment and setting her bag down against the wall before kneeling down to remove her shoes. She says it as a matter of fact, as if it’s an irrefutable statement and not just her own feelings.\n\n“Maybe not, but… I’m not just going to keep you cooped up here all alone. Besides, news of your release has already been made public. I’m sure it’ll only take a few more hours before the details come out. People will already know that you’re living with me now, so it’s fine if they see us together.”\n\nShe’s trying to say that she doesn’t care if they’re seen together, but it comes off as colder than she intends. Like she wouldn’t even entertain the thought of taking Himiko out if there were any chance of keeping this all a secret from the scathing eyes of society. She winces and holds her tongue between her teeth when she realizes her meaning didn’t get through.\n\nIf Himiko took it the wrong way, it doesn’t show. She just stands there, motionless, like she isn’t permitted to move unless given explicit permission. Even alone with Ochako like this, she’s still on guard.\n\n“Um, feel free to make yourself comfortable!” Ochako laughs in a desperate attempt to lighten the mood as she crosses the room to draw the curtains and let in some moonlight. Clouds drifting overhead obscure it, though, so she’s left standing there with a dumbfounded look on her face. “Uh… you can sit on the sofa or at the kotatsu, either one is fine. Or you could sit wherever else you want,” she says, though it isn’t like there is anywhere else to sit unless Himiko wants to hop up on the kitchen counter.\n\nHimiko eyes the sofa first, then the kotatsu, before taking a careful step forward. It takes her a while, but she eventually settles on the kotatsu, slowly making her way towards it and taking a seat on the floor, legs crossed and hands in her lap. She’s quiet for a while, as is Ochako, before she says anything else.\n\n“What are you going to do?”\n\nOchako’s almost forgotten how to speak. “Oh! Sorry, you must be hungry. I’ll get started on dinner. Is there anything specific you want to eat?”\n\nHimiko only shakes her head as Ochako scrambles over to the kitchen and nearly trips over her own feet. She braces herself against the counter—damn it, why is she so nervous? It’s only Himiko. Yes, Ochako wants to give her a good first day out of prison, and yes, she is in love with her, but she knows Himiko. She isn’t some stranger Ochako’s crushing on staying at her apartment for one reason or another, she’s the girl who she’s dedicated the better part of half a decade to helping.\n\nDeep breaths, Ochako. Deep breaths.\n\nShe breathes in deep and takes her time letting it out, repeating herself until her heart steadies itself in her chest. She can’t freak out, not now. Not when Himiko needs her to be strong. What Himiko also needs is a good meal; Ochako’s tried not to think about how skinny she’s gotten too much.\n\nSomething simple is best right now, something Ochako doesn’t have to tend to too often. She settles on curry. It’s easy to make, doesn’t take long, and most importantly, Himiko likes it. Ochako remembers from one of her earliest visits to Tartarus, where Himiko sat on the verge of tears over never being able to eat Dabi’s—no, Touya’s—curry again. Ochako can’t replace him or anyone from the League—she knows that, knows that the departed can’t ever return—but she can at the very least give Himiko something to smile about. Otherwise, what good is she?\n\nShe gets to work immediately, filling up the rice cooker and turning it on. She sets the pot on the stove and lays out the carrots and potatoes, moving like a well-oiled machine, determined to do something nice for the girl she loves. That machine comes to an abrupt halt when she looks through her cupboard and fails to find the most important ingredient of them all.\n\nShe doesn’t have any curry.\n\nIt would be funny if it weren’t so frustrating. She’s been preparing for this day for what feels like weeks, making her living space look presentable, buyings things she knows Himiko will need like a futon and menstrual products, and for all her worrying, she’s forgotten to go grocery shopping.\n\nOchako groans, quiet enough so that Himiko can’t hear her from where she sits silently in the living room. She makes note of what few ingredients she does have in an attempt to figure out something else she can make, something less significant, but comes up with nothing. There’s only one solution to this, and she hates it.\n\nThe thought of leaving Himiko right now feels like a hook in her chest pulling to the ground. It’s the last thing she wants to do, leaving her alone so soon after she said she wouldn’t do that exact thing, but what other choice does she have? She can’t bring Himiko with her, not now. It would all be too much too soon, and for as much faith as she has in her, Ochako isn’t sure she can handle that right now.\n\nThere aren’t many options here. Ochako resigns herself to heading out for a quick grocery run and leaving Himiko by herself for a while. It hurts, but if it means she’ll get to treat her to a nice meal, she’s sure it’ll be worth it.\n\n“Hey, Himiko? I’m going to go grab some groceries real quick, alright? There’s a store right down the street—I won’t be gone for more than a half hour.”\n\nHimiko’s only acknowledgement comes in the form of a quick look and slight nod. Ochako only catches a glimpse of her eyes for half a second, and that’s all it takes to make her feel like she’s taken a knife through the heart. Those gorgeous eyes that once shone like polished gold have lost their luster, and in its place is a debilitating darkness devoid of any emotion.\n\nSomething akin to anger bubbles up in Ochako’s stomach. She hates that she can’t tell what Himiko is feeling. The girl who once wore her emotions on her sleeve is gone and in her place is a husk, hollowed out by years of neglect and dehumanization at the hands of people who saw her as nothing more than a monster. They hurt her—they broke her—and all Ochako had been able to do to help was offer her smile and company once a month through a pane of bulletproof glass.\n\nIt hasn’t been much help, clearly.\n\nOchako grits her teeth, grabs her keys and tote bag, and slips on her shoes. “Feel free to explore,” she says as if there’s anything worth exploring. “You live here now, okay? It’s your place, too. You don’t have to just sit in the living room.”\n\nHimiko doesn’t acknowledge her, and Ochako is certain that she’ll burst into tears if she looks at her for even another second. She forces down the lump in her throat, pushes through the front door, and shuts it behind her.\n\nOchako is used to having eyes on her when out and about. She’s Uravity, after all, so it only makes sense that she would catch people’s attention even when off the job. Admiration is what’s most common, sometimes awe when it comes to kids. Tonight, however, those eyes are scathing.\n\nShe keeps her head down as she makes her way through the grocery store and tries to focus only on grabbing what she needs. Still, every gaze is a scorching ray that burns right through her. She hears them whispering, uttering her name and Himiko’s as if they’re curses.\n\nThe news must have broken.\n\nJust like that, Uravity’s good girl image is ruined beyond any hope of repair. It’s one thing to publicly speak out against harmful Quirk counselling practices or encourage better treatment for those born with more “undesirable” Quirks, but it’s another to take a convicted murderer into her own home. She won’t be able to recover from this. She’ll probably plummet through the rankings, be called on for less jobs, make less money.\n\nHelp less people.\n\nIt stings a little, it does, but she decides she doesn’t care. The only thing she’s done wrong is be a little selfish, and is that really a crime? What does it matter if part of the reason she was so determined to see Himiko released from prison was because she couldn’t bear to see her hurting any longer? That she yearned for her in a way the public could never understand? That she doesn’t hold Himiko’s past against her, because damn it, she loves her?\n\nI love her. I love her, I love her, I love her.\n\nOchako repeats it in her mind like a mantra and keeps her head down the whole time. It’s all she can do to stop scathing eyes from tearing her apart. Not even the cashier smiles at her as he goes through his script, the same greeting, the same questions, the same well wishes goodbye.\n\nThis must be a small taste of what Himiko’s been put through.\n\nShe wants to wither away, to be dust in the wind free from judgment and ridicule, but she has to be strong. She has to be strong for Himiko. So she puts on a smile before she opens her apartment door and enters with an upbeat bounce in her step.\n\n“I’m back! I bought some sweets, since I know you—”\n\nHimiko’s moved. It should be a good thing—it’s what Ochako wanted, after all—but she hasn’t gone very far. She’s on the couch now, head tucked into her knees, eyes glued to the television screen.\n\n“Notorious serial killer Himiko Toga … Beloved Pro-Hero Uravity… Disgusting display of favoritism and corruption…”\n\nNone of what the news anchor says gets across to Ochako completely. She tunes it out and instead focuses her attention on Himiko. She’s what matters right now, not what anyone outside might think of them.\n\nOchako closes the door behind her and tries to maintain her smile. Himiko isn’t even looking at her.\n\n“Are you sure you should be watching that?”\n\nShe’s almost surprised to hear Himiko respond as she makes her way into the kitchen to pack away her groceries.\n\n“I want to.”\n\n“Oh. Okay, but…” Ochako trails off. “Try not to let that stuff get to you, okay? They don’t know what they’re talking about.”\n\nHimiko stays silent.\n\nThat’s okay. Ochako isn’t her mother—she isn’t going to make her change the channel or turn off the TV or anything like that. Himiko can decide what she wants todo for herself, because she isn’t a prisoner anymore. If she wants to watch the news, she can watch the news. Telling herself that doesn’t make listening to it in the background as she starts dinner any easier, though.\n\nThe caster runs down a list of names and ages as Ochako cuts potatoes, one name for every chop. She runs out of potatoes before they run out of names.\n\nSixty-two people. Himiko Toga has killed sixty-two people. That’s sixty-two lives cut short, sixty-two heartbeats snuffed out, sixty-two families that got a little smaller. They weren’t all innocent, of course, but telling herself that does little to alleviate the pit in Ochako’s stomach.\n\nOchako knows Himiko has hurt a lot of people. She can’t forgive that—try as she might, it isn’t in her nature. She’s been trying to reconcile that with her feelings for her for the better part of five years. She tells herself Himiko can’t be held responsible because of her trauma, but she knows it isn’t true. She tells herself Himiko is remorseful, but also questions if that’s truly enough. She tells herself that someone’s past doesn’t define who they are, and she does believe that, but does it matter? Does it matter when Himiko has so much innocent blood on her hands?\n\nIn spite of it all, Ochako loves her all the same. That’s why she turns around so quickly when the word “monster” falls from an interviewee’s lips.\n\n“Do you want to take a bath?”\n\nIt’s the first thing that comes to mind. She doesn’t think she can stand to be idle while Himiko subjects herself to this any longer.\n\n“This isn’t a luxury apartment or anything, but the bathroom is really nice, I promise. Have you checked it out yet?”\n\nHimiko doesn’t say anything, but she does look at her when she speaks, and this time, she doesn’t look away.\n\n“I um, I don’t usually buy the fancy stuff, but I bought a nice brand of shampoo and conditioner when I went out shopping for us—for you, I mean. I’ve got bath salts, too. They smell great and always help me relax after a long day.”\n\nHimiko’s eyes fall. “I haven’t had a real bath in a while,” she mumbles.\n\n“Here, let me show you.”\n\nBefore she even knows what she’s doing, Ochako has taken Himiko by the hand and pulled her to her feet. She doesn’t resist, following along as Ochako leads her down the hall and into the bathroom. It’s bigger than bathrooms usually are in apartments like this, perfectly open and spacious, but the real draw is the bathtub. It’s more than big enough for a girl Himiko’s size and temperature controlled to boot (Ochako prides herself on modesty, but she’s allowed a little excess every now and then).\n\n“I’ll leave a change of clothes out for you. Dinner should be ready by the time you’re finished, so make yourself at home and take as long as you want, okay?”\n\nAgain, Himiko is silent, but that’s jut fine. Ochako wasn’t expecting her to respond anyway. Just as she turns around to leave, though, there’s a tug at her sleeve that stops her. Ochako looks back and her breath catches in her throat.\n\nThose eyes. There’s a twinkle in them that wasn’t there before. It’s so faint anyone else wouldn’t have noticed. But Ochako does.\n\n“… Thank you, Ochako.”\n\nIt’s the first time Himiko’s said her name all day. Her heart pounds against her ribcage at the sound, as if it wants to break free, but she’s able to temper herself for the time being. She gives Himiko a reassuring smile.\n\n“What are friends for?”\n\nHimiko releases her, and a few seconds later, Ochako’s back is against the hallway wall and her fingers are clutching at her chest. She covers her mouth so as to muffle any noise she might make as she slides down the wall and squeezes her eyes shut.\n\nIt hurts. It hurts so much.\n\nDinner goes about as Ochako expects.\n\nShe tries to make conversation, but Himiko’s responses are succinct and don’t leave much room for follow-up. It’s clear she doesn’t want to talk, so Ochako doesn’t try and make her.\n\nHimiko eats slowly, but she savors every bite. Ochako lets herself silently revel in her victory: cooking a delicious meal for the girl she loves. Victory is fleeting, however, and dinner ends before Ochako knows it.\n\nShe takes a bath while Himiko gets ready to end the day. A quick one, because she can’t stand the idea of leaving Himiko alone any longer than she has to. Himiko barely makes a sound as she lays out her futon next to Ochako’s bed.\n\nGuilt grips Ochako’s chest like a vice as she settles into bed. Lying above Himiko like this, as if she’s somehow better than her, feels wrong. But it’s not like she can sleep on the floor—Himiko wouldn’t like that, so she pushes her guilt down, down, down, until it doesn’t bother her so much, and thinks about more positive things.\n\nThis reminds me of those days back at U.A., where she and the rest of the girls would have sleepovers at Momo’s place. Her first year of high school was certainly more eventful than most people’s, but looking back on it, she remembers those little slumber parties being fun and carefree. She knows it’s different now, though. Himiko isn’t just staying the night, she lives here now for at least the next year.\n\nIt’s selfish, but Ochako dares to hope she’ll stay longer than that.\n\nThe lights are off now. They’ve said their goodnights. Ochako doesn’t bother trying to fall asleep, instead opting to stare up at the ceiling and lie there alone with her thoughts.\n\nHimiko didn’t smile today. Not even a little. For all Ochako’s efforts, she’s failed. But that’s okay, right? There’s always tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after. Ochako never considered giving up even in the face of seemingly impossible to overcome roadblocks as she worked herself to the bone in order to secure Himiko’s freedom, so to give up on seeing her smile after only a day would be to spit in the face of everything she and Himiko have done to get here.\n\nOchako swears she’ll make her happy if it’s the last thing she does, because Himiko deserves it. She’s suffered so much in life and is sure to suffer even more, and damn it, all Ochako wants is for her to be happy. She doesn’t care what it means for her own reputation. Let them stare, let them criticize, none of it matters. All that matters is Himiko.\n\n“Are you awake?”\n\nThe sound of her voice shocks Ochako out of her own head.\n\n“Huh? Yeah, I’m awake.”\n\nIt’s quiet for a while before Himiko continues. “Sorry for not talking much today. You must be disappointed.”\n\n“What? No no no, I get it. Today can’t have been easy been easy for you.”\n\n“But there must be a lot you want to talk about,” Himiko says. “We can.”\n\nOchako sits up, looking down at her lap. “Himiko… we don’t have to talk about anything you don’t want to.”\n\n“I want you to know.” Ochako’s heart throbs. “You deserve it. So ask.”\n\nOchako hesitates and lets out a staggered breath. The situation is delicate, like a rose of glass, and any misstep is sure to shatter it. She doesn’t want to hurt her—doesn’t want to twist the knife in still open wounds, but she knows Himiko, and she knows rejecting her now is a guaranteed way to do just that. So she opts to be honest, and poses the question that’s been eating away at her as gently as she can.\n\n“… What did they do to you?”\n\nIt’s too heavy a question, Ochako knows. Himiko couldn’t possibly give a comprehensive answer, but she can talk about what she’s ready to talk about, and that’s the important thing.\n\nHimiko begins quietly, her voice a mere whisper.\n\n“They made me wear a muzzle, my first year in Tartarus,” Himiko says, and Ochako’s stomach drops. “They took it off when it was time to eat and for visitation, but that’s it. They didn’t want me biting myself. The psychiatrist I was assigned took a year to decide I wasn’t a danger to myself and that it was safe to take it off for good. I hated wearing that thing. They kept me alone in a cell with nothing to do and put a muzzle on me like I was an animal, and every time one of those asshole guards came to take it off, they treated me like I’d attack them if they looked at me the wrong way. As if I couldn’t control myself.”\n\nAnger coats her words, and it’s the most emotion Ochako has heard from her all day.\n\n“I didn’t know if I could go on living like that. But… you and Izuku and Tsuyu would visit, and you talked like I wouldn’t be stuck there for the rest of my life, and I started to believe it. The only thing that kept me going every day was the hope that one day I wouldn’t have to wake up alone anymore. I guess that’s why I was so happy when I found out I was being transferred.”\n\nPeople aren’t ever transferred out of Tartarus. It just doesn’t happen. As far as Ochako knows, Himiko was the first and possibly the last instance of a villain being held in Tartarus and making it out through the proper channels. Ochako remembers the day she received news of Himiko’s transfer well. She’d cried for a while, ecstatic to have finally made some progress in her efforts to see Himiko released, but more than that, she was just glad Himiko wouldn’t have to suffer in that cesspool any longer.\n\n“I’ve told you about the other prison before. I thought being around other people would be better, but in the end, I just ended up trading isolation for animosity. It’s funny.” Himiko let out something of a laugh. “I was surrounded by criminals just like me, murderers and rapists, the dregs of society, but they still treated me like an outcast.”\n\n“Why?” Ochako whispered.\n\n“… Do you know how many people were killed by the League of Villains?”\n\nShe does. The death toll hasn’t ever left her mind.\n\n“A lot of the other inmates lost people they knew. Friends, family, lovers. They weren’t happy to have one of the people responsible for all that death among them, and they made sure I knew it. They tormented me every meal, every shower, every night—” Her voice breaks in tandem with Ochako’s heart. “And those stupid power-tripping guards didn’t make it any better. They loved having a villain like me at their mercy. They loved forcing me to do whatever they wanted. And they loved showing me just how cruel they could be when they got angry. The bruises…”\n\nCompassion and fury alike coalesce in the pit of Ochako’s stomach. The thought of anyone hurting Himiko—her Himiko—enrages her, makes her blood boil, but there’s no sense in letting anger get the best of her now. What Himiko needs isn’t for someone to get angry on her behalf, no, it’s the same thing she’s always needed, the same thing that could have saved her a life of pain and heartache.\n\nAll Ochako needs to do is reach out, and touch that sadness inside of her.\n\n“Himiko…” Ochako’s voice is quiet and careful. “Can you come up here?”\n\nIt takes a moment or two, but Himiko grants her request, rising from her futon to sit at Ochako’s bedside. Moonlight peering in through the window illuminates her features, the gentle curve of her cheeks, the pout of her lips, though she keeps her eyes cast downwards.\n\n“Please look at me.”\n\nHimiko tenses up. She’s trembling now, and it takes every ounce of willpower in Ochako’s body to stop herself from bursting into tears. After a few moments, Himiko finally turns her head to meet Ochako’s gaze, and it takes her breath away.\n\nHer eyes seem to glimmer in the moonlight now, a far cry from the patina of muted grey that shrouded them before, but that glimmer doesn’t carry even an ounce of mirth. She doesn’t smile. She doesn’t cry, either. She just sits there, bedsheets bunched in her grasp, tongue caught in her teeth.\n\nThere’s no sense in resisting. Ochako pulls her into an embrace and holds her close, one hand on her back and the other on her head. Her heart pounds in her chest—it’s been far, far too long since she’s been able to touch Himiko like this, and just a small taste has her longing for more. She wants so desperately to kiss her, to touch her all over, to hold her in her arms forever, but she knows she shouldn’t. She couldn’t. This is about Himiko, not sating her own selfish desires.\n\nHimiko is still for a while before returning the gesture and wrapping her arms around her benefactor. Her friend. Her head atop Ochako’s shoulder like a puzzle piece, and while she shivers like she’s caught in a blizzard, she does not cry. She just breathes, every breath a perfect staccato, and Ochako holds her the whole way through.\n\nIt takes a while, but Himiko stops shaking soon enough. She slips out of Ochako’s embrace, and while Ochako mourns the loss of contact and comforting warmth, she revels in the way Himiko looks at her.\n\n“What about you?” she asks. “Have you been okay?”\n\nInstinct tells Ochako to assure her she’s been fine and pivot back to talking about Himiko, but she senses she doesn’t want to talk about what she’s had to endure any longer.\n\n“I’ve been good, yeah. My dad’s health hasn’t been great lately, but his company is still thriving, so medical bills haven’t been an issue. Still, it’s a little stressful. Uh, work’s more or less the same as it always is. There are slow days, then there are normal days, then there are days that make me remember how tough it is being a hero, but it’s worth it. I get to save people, and that’s what I signed up for, so…” Ochako trails off into a faint laugh and she brushes a lock of hair behind her ear.\n\n“You aren’t lonely?”\n\n“Lonely?” She raises an eyebrow. “No, not at all. Why would I be? I chat with Tsu almost every day and get together with the girls here and there.”\n\nHimiko blinks. “You live alone. I always figured you and Izuku would live together.”\n\n“Oh. Ah, no, we don’t, haha…”\n\nOchako can’t bring herself to maintain eye contact, not now. She looks instead down at Himiko’s hands, one atop the other resting in her lap.\n\n“… When did you break up?”\n\nThere it is. Ochako winces at the question. She thought she’d been prepared for this inevitable conversation, but now that it’s arrived, she’s struggles to find words. She supposes all she can do is be honest.\n\n“Two years ago,” she mumbles.\n\n“You never told me.”\n\n“I’m sorry. I guess I assumed Deku or Tsu would tell you eventually. I just… didn’t want to make you sad.”\n\nOchako and Deku got together shortly before Himiko’s sentencing, and the news lit up her face like a star in the sky. That was precisely what she wanted, for Ochako to finally stop suppressing her feelings and go after what she wanted, and Himiko was ecstatic to witness the fruits of Ochako’s success. She always smiled when Ochako and Deku would come to visit during her early days at Tartarus. Ochako could see in her eyes how much she loved seeing them together, loved seeing them happy together on the other side of the glass that separated her from the rest of the world. How was Ochako supposed to break the news to her years later when Himiko looked more and more miserable with every passing month?\n\n“You don’t have to worry about making me sad. I’m not so delicate.” Himiko brings her legs up on the bed and crosses them so that she can sit facing Ochako directly. It’s subtle, but she leans forward ever so slightly, and it’s enough to make roses bloom on Ochako’s cheeks. She knows it’s silly—they were hugging only a minute ago and she was getting nervous now? She’s a grown adult, not some silly little schoolgirl freaking out over a crush, though that’s definitely what she feels like in the moment.\n\n“What happened?” Himiko asks. “If you’re okay talking about it.”\n\nOchako swallows, her throat dry. “It’s fine. Things just kind of… fizzled out, I guess. We both got so busy and couldn’t spend as much time together as we used to, and when we would see each other, I stopped getting those butterflies I used to get around him. I think he must have lost them, too, because I started to feel like he wasn’t treating me like his girlfriend anymore, but just a precious friend, like Bakugou or Todoroki.”\n\nHimiko furrows her brow, and for a moment, she looks almost offended on Ochako’s behalf. “Why?”\n\n“I don’t know for sure, but I don’t blame him. Being so busy meant I couldn’t offer as much support as I used to. We used to travel together, visiting different parts of the country for all kinds of events, but I couldn’t keep up with that forever.”\n\nOchako dares to look up, and when she does, she finds Himiko leaning in even further. God, when did she get so close?\n\n“I think I understand,” Himiko mutters. “I know that love doesn’t always last forever.”\n\nOchako bites her lip and tries to ignore her throbbing heart and the heat spreading throughout her body. She and Himiko have talked about love before, but now, she feels like it means something different entirely.\n\n“That’s just it, though. I think—” Ochako’s voice catches in her throat as she hesitates to speak her next words. “I think… I’ll always love Deku. We’ve been through so much together, and he’s always been there for me, and he’s one of my best friends. But… the more I think about it, the more I wonder if I was ever really in love with him, you know?” The way Himiko’s eyebrow cocks makes Ochako’s heart skip a beat. “I mean, Deku is great. He is. He’s strong in the ways that matter, and he always stands up for people who can’t defend themselves, and never gives up on anyone. He’s everything a hero should be, and I admire him more than I do anyone else. Sometimes I think I confused those feelings for love—romantic love, I mean—because now, I—”\n\nThe rest of her words are lost to her own trepidation. Now, she knows what love feels like for her. Love makes her feel like she’s floating, onwards and upwards into an everlasting bliss so far out of reach that the mere act of hoping for it makes her a fool. It makes her feel like her chest is ripping in half, every aspect of who and what Ochako Uraraka is spilling out for the world to see, and it’s all she can do to desperately hide it. They can never see her laid bare like that, because it would mean nothing but pain for her and the root of these agonizing feelings. Her love takes every minor victory and makes it more than that—everything is so much bigger and brighter and deeper with her in Ochako’s life—and damn it, her love hurts. It hurts like the weight of the world crushing her, like an inferno engulfing her, like water filling her lungs, but it keeps her alive for all of it and amplifies every sensation. It’s a divine torture, and Ochako never wants to stop feeling it.\n\nDeku never made her heart wail like Himiko does.\n\n“I don’t know if he and I ever could have lasted,” Ochako whispers. “In the end, we just couldn’t give each other what we wanted.”\n\nHimiko purses her lips and dares to ask.\n\n“What was it you wanted?”\n\nTime stops.\n\nThey lock eyes.\n\nOchako isn’t strong enough to stop herself.\n\nKissing Himiko ignites a red-hot supernova in her chest and does nothing to sedate her racing heart. No, it galvanizes it, making her feel as if it’s on the verge of bursting out of her chest in a display of bright and vibrant crimson. Her lips are soft like velvet pillows and sweet as fresh strawberries, and the sensation only makes Ochako want more. She leans into it more, more, wanting nothing more than to be as close to the girl she fell in love with as possible.\n\nShe’s floating again, weightless, on cloud nine as she takes Himiko’s face gently into her hands. The scent of Ochako’s shampoo in her hair nearly makes her melt, but that’s when she’s snapped out of her dreamlike daze. In all her indulgence, it’s taken her until now to realize that while Himiko hasn’t done anything to stop her, she isn’t kissing her back, either.\n\nOchako pulls away with a gasp and fear in her eyes. Himiko is stunned, simply staring back at her with eyes wide and mouth hung open. A lump rises in Ochako’s throat as she questions what she’s done. Has she taken advantage of her? Has she trapped Himiko here in a gilded cage only to at last make her hers’ after all these years?\n\nHer hands fly to her lips as if she’s burned them. Himiko raises her fingertips to brush against her own lips as tears prick at the corners of Ochako’s eyes.\n\n“Ochako—”\n\n“I love you.”\n\nOchako covers her mouth again as the first tear rolls down her face. She didn’t mean to say it, and now that she has, there’s no taking it back.\n\nHimiko’s face twists in shock and disbelief, tears filling her own eyes. The sight alone is enough to break Ochako’s heart; it’s been years since Himiko’s looked at her like this, with such anger in her eyes.\n\n“N-No, you don’t. You can’t.”\n\n“I do! I love you, Himiko, I—I love you so much!” It doesn’t matter how hard she tries, Ochako can’t stop the words from flooding out like a torrent. “I can never get your smile out of my head. I haven’t been able to for five years. You’re the cutest girl in the world, and you love so much, I know it’s selfish, but I want that love all to myself! I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy, and I don’t care if it costs me every drop of blood in my body!”\n\n“No!” Himiko squeezes her eyes shut and holds her head in her hands, tears spilling down her cheeks. “Don’t you get it? I’m a villain, Ochako! I’ve hurt so many people—how could you ever love someone like me? You took me in when all I’ll end up doing is ruining your life and dragging you down with me!”\n\nOchako reaches out to take Himiko hands and hold them firmly in her own, making certain she knows that no matter what, Ochako is there. “You could never ruin my life. All you’ve done is make it so much brighter. You taught me that I shouldn’t suppress my feelings or hide them from anyone, so I don’t care what anyone has to say about it, I love you, and I’ll scream it to the world if that’s what you want. You can ask for the impossible and I’ll make it possible. I’d do anything for you, because you saved me, Himiko.” She kisses her knuckles as sobs wrack Himiko’s body. “You’re the one I want.”\n\nShe hates herself for making Himiko cry like this, but it was inevitable. She has to do this, has to make her understand.\n\n“I told you already.” Ochako kisses away each and every tear that falls from Himiko’s eyes. “I’ll give you my blood for the rest of our lives.” She touches her forehead to Himiko’s and manages to smile through her own tears. “I mean it.”\n\nHimiko barely has to move to kiss her, they’re so close. There’s but a moment between that one and the next, and soon enough, Ochako peppers her with a dozen little kisses. She kisses the corners of Himiko’s mouth, her cheeks, her forehead, trails her lips down her neck, everywhere.\n\n“I—I love you,” Himiko chokes out. She’s said it before, so many times, but now it’s sweet music to Ochako’s ears. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”\n\nThey stay like that for a while, holding and kissing each other, whispering sweet nothings and honeyed words. Soon enough, they both stop crying, and Himiko leans back to put her hands on Ochako’s shoulders and look her in the eyes.\n\n“Okay,” she breathes, palming away the last remnants of her tears. “Okay. We can do this. But… I don’t know if I can give you what you want.”\n\n“Of course you can, Himiko. You’ve already given me so much.”\n\n“I don’t understand what that is, though,” Himiko admits. Ochako caresses her face and she leans into it, like a cat being pet. “I’ve taken so much from people that I don’t know if I remember how to give anymore, but I want to try. I have to know what you expect from me to do that, though, so…” She rephrases her earlier question. “What is it you want?”\n\nOchako lets out a breath. She’s spent so much time thinking about what she wants to give Himiko that she’s never even considered what she wants from her beyond a smile.\n\n“I want… I want you to lean on me when things get tough,” she begins. “I want you to let me show you parts of myself no one else has ever seen. I want you to stay with me, forever. I want…” Ochako bites her lip, face reddening as her eyes fall to Himiko’s bare legs. Her skin looks so soft, so smooth. “I think I’ve learned that people get greedy when they’re in love. They get hungry, and selfish.” She doesn’t even realize she’s tracing her finger along Himiko’s jawline now, down her neck, along her collarbone. “I want to do a lot of things with you, Himiko. I want it all.”\n\nShe looks up again.\n\n“You get what I’m saying, right?”\n\nWith her cheeks flushed and heart full, Himiko looks so much like the girl Ochako met in high school.\n\n“Y-Yeah.”\n\nOchako dares to pull Himiko closer and she obliges, straddling Ochako’s waist with her arms around her neck.\n\n“Do you want the same?”\n\nThe corners of Himiko’s mouth twitch and Ochako feels her heart stop. Slowly but surely Himiko’s lips stretch into what Ochako’s been working towards all day. A faint smile, but beautiful all the same.\n\n“You’re so weird, Ochako.”\n\nIt’s all Himiko needs to say.\n\nOchako presses her lips to Himiko’s and devours every tiny moan she lets out, fingers clumsily fumbling about until they find the hem of her shirt. She only breaks the kiss so that Himiko can raise her arms and let Ochako pull her shirt off.\n\nWith her bare chest exposed like this, Himiko is like something out of a painting, soft moonbeams peering in through the window to light up and highlight every subtle curve. She’s gotten thinner since the last time Ochako saw her naked, back when they were enemies, but she’s perfect all the same.\n\nOchako leans forward to lay her on her back and kisses her again, long and full, before moving to her neck. She nips at Himiko’s skin, marking her, and momentarily wonders just when the hell she became so dominant. She’s always let the other party take the lead, but she figures Himiko must have flipped a switch somewhere inside of her.\n\nIt helps that Himiko’s little gasps are all the encouragement Ochako needs to continue. Every breath spurs her on that much more. She alternates between gentle kisses and little bites as she makes her way down to Himiko’s chest, and when she sticks her tongue out ever so slightly for a tentative lick, Himiko suddenly seizes her shirt.\n\n“W-Wait.”\n\nOchako backs off immediately and sits straight up, but what she finds on Himiko’s face isn’t fear or hesitation, but rather shy curiosity.\n\n“You’ve done this before, right?”\n\nIf Ochako wasn’t blushing before, she definitely is now. She awkwardly rubs at the back of her head and nods.\n\n“Um, yeah, haha. With Deku, a few times. It took a while before either of us really figured out what we were doing.”\n\nHimiko’s lips press together in a tight line. “Have you ever been with another girl?”\n\nThe question feels like a blow to the stomach. That is something she’s been hoping to avoid.\n\n“Yes,” she admits, her voice small. “With, um… Tsu.”\n\nHimiko’s eyes widen in surprise. “Tsuyu?”\n\n“Just the one time, I swear! It was after one of Mina’s parties and Deku and I had been broken up for a while and she was curious and I guess I just really wanted to spend the night with someone and—”\n\n“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Himiko says, but Ochako can tell she’s still a little stunned. “I just wanted to know how much more experienced you are than me.”\n\nOchako lets out a sigh of relief. The last thing she needs is Himiko thinking she’s some sort of floozy who goes around sleeping with all her friends.\n\n“In that case, I… I want to do you first.”\n\nOchako blinks back her surprise. Himiko is a virgin as far as she knows, and usually the more experienced person takes the lead in these cases, right? Then again, Himiko has never been one much for doing things by the book.\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\nHimiko nods. “You’ve already done so much for me. I don’t know if I can ever repay you for everything, but I can at least do this for you. So please,” she bites her lip, and oh, the sight alone is enough to stoke heat in Ochako’s core, “let me make you feel good.”\n\nOchako doesn’t need to be told twice.\n\nIt takes some effort, but soon enough, Himiko has pulled Ochako’s shirt up and over her arms and tossed it aside. She clumsily fiddles around with the hook of Ochako’s bra at her back as they kiss, letting out a noise of frustration after one too many failures. Ochako can’t help but giggle. For all the pain she’s endured, for all she’s suffered, Himiko is just as adorable as she’s always been.\n\nOchako offers a helping hand and reaches back to unclip her bra. She works the straps off her shoulders, but it’s Himiko who removes it completely, exposing Ochako’s chest to the cool night air and Himiko’s bright eyes.\n\nHimiko stares at Ochako’s breasts like they’re a spectacle, mesmerized, enraptured. Ochako would be embarrassed under any other circumstance, but now, she just smiles at the shine in Himiko’s eyes and the warmth spreading from her chest. That warmth is short lived, though, and dissipates the moment Himiko’s gaze falls low enough for her to wince.\n\n“Himiko?” Ochako looks down to see what could have made her react like that, and—\n\nOh. Of course.\n\nOchako is just about to reassure Himiko that she’s okay when she’s suddenly pushed back onto the bed. Himiko is all over her, kissing everywhere from her lips to her shoulders, her collar to her breasts, and when she finally lands on Ochako’s stomach, she pauses.\n\nHimiko doesn’t say anything. She just presses her lips gently onto the raised scar tissue left by her blade all those years ago, over and over as if to bless Ochako with a thousand apologies, and each kiss has her falling in love just a little more.\n\nA gasp falls from Ochako’s lips as Himiko climbs her way back up and peppers her chest in kiss after kiss. Himiko is voracious, insatiable, kneading Ochako’s breasts in both hands all the while not leaving even an inch of skin untouched by her lips. It’s when she closes her lips around a bud that Ochako lets out a sweet and unrestrained moan.\n\nHimiko pauses, just for a moment, before continuing her relentless assault. She doesn’t need to be told she’s found Ochako’s weak spot. It’s obvious enough from the way she writhes and squirms beneath Himiko’s touch, pale skin reddenning as blood rises to the surface.\n\nOchako closes her eyes and lets out a shaky breath as she sinks further into the bed, letting Himiko carry her away someplace divine with her lips, teeth, and tongue. Being here tonight with Himiko Toga, the girl of her dreams in her bed lavishing her with an adoring fervor, feels almost too good to be true, but it’s real. Himiko is here, and no one will take her away ever again.\n\nHimiko releases her with a pop and looks at her with warm eyes, tongue hanging from her mouth, a thin trail of saliva still connecting them. Her sultry gaze is filled with desire, with needy desperation, and Ochako is all too willing to sate it.\n\nShe raises her hips just high enough for Himiko to get her thumbs under the waistband of her pyjama bottoms and slide them right off. Her underwear soon follows, and while Himiko’s pace is anything but languid, Ochako gets the sense she savors every moment all the same.\n\nGentle hands part Ochako’s legs as Himiko makes her descent, lips faintly brushing against Ochako’s skin. Ochako simply leans back and closes her eyes to let Himiko do as she pleases. It’s what she deserves after a lifetime of being made to repress her desires, her urges, the things that made Himiko herself. Now she can do as she pleases, love how she wants, and Ochako couldn’t be more content.\n\n“Oh, wow,” Himiko whispers. Her breath against Ochako’s mound sends a shudder up the hero’s spine and goosebumps rippling across her skin. She’s too aroused to be embarrassed right now, but she can feel how hot and wet she is, can picture how red she must be.\n\nBut Himiko has always liked red.\n\nOchako whimpers the instant Himiko’s tongue makes contact. She doesn’t spend any time lingering around her entrance and working Ochako up even more, no, she goes straight for her target. Every swipe of her warm, wet tongue has Ochako squirming, unable to hold her voice in as Himiko lavishes her—and really, why would she? She doesn’t want to hold anything back, not with Himiko, not anymore.\n\nHimiko’s tongue makes its way inside and Ochako cries out, unabashed and unashamed. Oh, this is wonderful. What she lacks in technique or experience she makes up for in sheer enthusiasm and vigor, working her tongue in circles until she has Ochako practically singing her name. Her nails dig into Ochako’s thighs, and while tears well in her eyes, the mix of pleasure and pain only turns Ochako on more.\n\nOchako’s had partners go down on her before, and this is nothing like those times. Himiko may not be as precisely calculated as Deku or capable of reaching the same depths as Tsuyu, but none of that matters. Sex with those two felt good, but sex with Himiko feels right, like this is where Ochako belongs, Himiko’s head between her legs, her fingers threading through those blonde locks.\n\nHimiko licks and laps away at her like she can’t get enough, like Ochako is a drug she craves. Finally, her pointed tongue finds that sensitive nub at Ochako’s crest and her thighs nearly clamp shut around Himiko’s head at the sensation. Heat builds in Ochako’s core as Himiko works her tongue in small circles and long, broad strokes. She doesn’t relent for even a moment, and soon enough, the pressure within threatens to burst.\n\nThere’s no point in trying to hold still. Ochako writhes and squirms beneath Himiko’s gratifying touch as all sorts of sounds flow out of her nonstop. Incoherent words of affirmation, declarations of love, Himiko’s name, over and over again. Fire burns in Ochako’s core and behind Himiko’s eyes—she’s so eager to bring her to climax, and already Ochako teeters on the verge of heaven.\n\nKeen hands grab her waist and pull Ochako closer just as Himiko latches onto her clit, sucking, each flick of her tongue sending ripples of exhilaration pulsing through Ochako’s entire body, and that’s all it takes for her to fall to pieces.\n\n“Himiko—!”\n\nThe pressure within bursts all at once. Ochako rides the waves of ecstasy ripping through her, legs trembling, stomach undulating, and lets out a loud and rapturous sound she had no idea she was capable of producing. Himiko doesn’t let up even for a second, holding on wave after wave, and it’s only when Ochako descends from the pinnacle of ecstasy and her quakes become minor tremors that she releases her and lifts her head.\n\nEven through the haze of her vision, Ochako can see that the lower half of Himiko’s face is slick and shiny, covered in her own saliva and Ochako’s release. Himiko faintly smiles up at her—oh, there it is again, that strange and oh so wonderful feeling in her chest—and lays her head against Ochako’s thigh.\n\n“You taste good,” she says. Ochako doesn’t think she can blush any more than she already is. All she manages to whisper is a word of thanks through full, heavy breaths, and then Himiko’s eyes fall alongside her smile. She opens her mouth to speak, but hesitates.\n\n“Ochako,” she begins, wary, “can I…?”\n\nOchako just smiles down at her.\n\n“For the rest of our lives, remember?”\n\nHimiko’s eyes light up like stars. Carefully, she maneuvers herself back between Ochako’s legs and stares at her thigh like it’s a sweet, juicy treat just ripe for the taking. There’s no more hesitation as she kisses the soft, pliable flesh.\n\nGentle pressure gives way to stinging pain as Himiko sinks her teeth into Ochako’s thigh. Those sharp fangs pierce through with barely any resistance and Ochako hisses through clenched teeth. It hurts, but… it’s a sweet sort of pain, the kind Ochako doesn’t mind. In fact, it feels good, Himiko’s fangs inside her as her tongue caresses her skin. She barely has to suck to get a steady stream of blood going.\n\nA whine of pleasure escapes from Ochako’s throat as her mind grows foggy. She hopes Himiko won’t spill a single drop—she deserves it all, and it would be a shame to let any go to waste and stain the duvet, which she supposes she’ll have to wash anyway after tonight. But that’s a thought for tomorrow. Right now, the only thing she wants to think about is Himiko and how good she looks between her legs.\n\nTears prick at Himiko’s eyes and she looks so, so fulfilled, like she’s been waiting her entire life for this. Her cheeks are flushed, a vibrant bright pink, and a single trail of crimson dribbles down her chin. Ochako doesn’t care how blissfully lightheaded she’s starting to feel, she’ll let Himiko drain her completely if that’s what she wants, but after what feels like a lifetime, Himiko extracts her fangs and lays adoring kisses over the puncture wounds, licking up any residual blood trickling down Ochako’s thigh.\n\nOchako’s so dizzy she barely registers Himiko coming up from between her legs to kiss her, but Himiko’s lips on hers certainly pull her from her daze. She can still taste the metallic flavor of her blood on Himiko’s lips, on her tongue. By the time Ochako’s vision has cleared up and she’s regained her clarity, Himiko pulls away to look down at her, and Ochako swears she feels the world light up.\n\nThere it is.\n\nIt’s what Ochako’s been trying for all day, that beautiful smile she hasn’t been able to get out of her head for five years. It stretches so wide it should be impossible, her alluring yet lethal fangs on full display, her eyes full of an uninhibited euphoria Ochako hasn’t seen in so long. She smiles in turn and Himiko laughs before going back in for another kiss.\n\n“You’re so cute,” Ochako mumbles between kisses. “So cute.”\n\nHimiko’s turn arrives not long after. She grants Ochako’s request to toss aside her drenched shorts and ruined underwear before shifting up and straddling Ochako’s face, and the sound of delight she lets out upon first contact with Ochako’s tongue sends a bolt of desire straight through her.\n\nIt’s art, the noises and expressions Himiko makes as Ochako works magic with her tongue. Ochako almost can’t believe that Himiko’s like that because of her, that the same girl who’d stuck in a knife in her just a few years ago is now throwing her head back in ecstasy and riding her face, but love rarely takes people exactly where they expect. Who could have predicted that one night she’d be lying naked in bed and tongue deep in a serial killer?\n\nBut… Himiko is more than that, more than her sins. She likes cats and pomegranates. She likes cute clothes and girly accessories. She’s sensitive, passionate, and she loves with an ardor to rival even the most lovestruck teenage girls. Years of incarceration had tried to strip Himiko of everything that makes her who she is, to convert her into just a number, just another cog in the machine, and Himiko had survived because she’s strong. That’s what Ochako has always admired about her, the strength to be who she is even in the face of the greatest adversity.\n\nOchako runs her hands all over the planes and curves of Himiko’s body, gripping her waist, fondling her breasts, thumbing over her nipples, and is pleased to discover just how reactive she is. Every touch makes her whimper in an absolutely adorable way that encourages Ochako to bring out every sweet sound she can. Whereas Himiko is ravenous in her approach to sex, Ochako has always preferred taking her time. She’s slower, more leisurely, and Himiko is just as receptive as Ochako hoped she’d be.\n\nOchako could lie here all night, Himiko’s thighs clamped around her head until the sun comes up, but to claim she didn’t want more would be a betrayal of her desires. Himiko yelps as she’s suddenly made weightless and Ochako sits up only to gently drop her onto the bed and press her body flush against Himiko’s. Ochako isn’t sure if Himiko is more surprised by her unexpectantly shifting positions or by her display of mastery over her Quirk, but it doesn’t matter, because that surprise is eclipsed by the pleasure that sets in when the pads of Ochako’s fingers brush against her labia.\n\nHer touch is feather-light and delicate as the first fall of winter snow. Ochako is all too used to acting with this sort of gentleness when it comes to rescues, so applying it to pleasuring Himiko feels natural, easy. She strokes her from her peak to the length of her entrance, careful not to venture too far forward, and lays soft kisses all over Himiko’s chest. Himiko wraps her arms around Ochako’s head and pulls her close with a shudder. She’s perfectly content just like this, held in Himiko’s embrace, fingers ghosting over her skin like a breeze.\n\n“Ochako, please.”\n\nClearly, Himiko is not.\n\nOchako starts off slow, inserting just the tip of a single finger, and the cry of pleasure that rips from Himiko’s throat sets her alight. Himiko grinds her hips forward, desperate for more, and Ochako grants her wish by pushing in another finger and delving even deeper. Her insides are wet, hot, and inviting, like an divine onsen, so Ochako buries her fingers completely. Himiko mewls as Ochako’s fingers twist and explore her tunnel and her legs suddenly spasm when she hits a particular spot.\n\nSatisfaction seeps into Ochako’s chest as she allows a rare prideful smile to spread across her lips. She’d found it in no time at all.\n\nOchako pumps her slick digits in a steady rhythm, alternating between the entirety of Himiko’s depth and that sweet spot that just drives her crazy, and the results are better than she could have hoped. Himiko writhes beneath Ochako’s bare body as she plunges her fingers in and out, over and over, rubbing the heel of her palm against Himiko’s bud for even further stimulation. Ochako’s got her on the precipice now, breaths coming out in little ah-ah-ahs in tandem with each pump of Ochako’s fingers.\n\nShe picks Himiko apart piece-by-piece, gradually taking her higher and higher towards that perfect crescendo, and all the while, she smiles. It’s hard not to when she gets to look at Himiko’s blissed-out face like this and draw out all sorts of absolutely delightful sounds from her throat. But for as exhilarating and fulfilling as this is, there’s still something she’d like to see before she misses her chance.\n\n“Himiko,” she softly breathes, the smile on her lips fading. “Look at me.”\n\nHimiko does, long lashes lifting to unveil pools of shimmering gold, so easy to drown in. Ochako holds her gaze, getting lost in them, and whispers one last time.\n\n“Stay with me.”\n\nHer fingers curl, and that’s all it takes.\n\nHimiko doesn’t pop all at once like Ochako does, no. She blooms, like a red rose unfurling its petals to unveil the mesmerizing corolla within. Her body shakes like a flower in the wind as her walls pulse tightly around Ochako’s fingers and she lets out a moan Ochako is sure she won’t ever forget. It’s beautiful, a spectacle, a masterpiece of heavenly art somehow more priceless than any piece in even the finest musuem, and Ochako is so, so grateful that she gets to bear witness to it right here in her own bedroom.\n\nOchako is pleased to find that once Himiko starts coming, she doesn’t stop. She works her through a second orgasm, then a third, only letting up when Himiko finally goes limp beneath her, tears streaming down her face from overstimulation and emotional intensity alike. Ochako carefully slides her dripping wet fingers out and lays a kiss upon Himiko’s lips just as Himiko tightly wraps her arms around her.\n\n“I love you,” Himiko sobs, and she punctuates it with a kiss of her own. “I love you. I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you.”\n\nShe repeats herself over and over, again and again, and Ochako knows she’ll never get tired of hearing it.\n\nIt takes a while for things to wind down, for Ochako’s heartbeat to steady, for Himiko’s sobs to stop, but they do soon enough. From there, they simply hold each other in their arms, Himiko’s head against the soft cushion of Ochako’s chest, and just when Ochako thinks they’re about to drift off to sleep like this, Himiko speaks.\n\n“I didn’t mean to cry so much,” she says as Ochako combs her fingers through her hair.\n\nOchako shakes her head, smiling. “It’s okay. You can cry as much as you want with me.”\n\n“I know I can. You’re nice like that.” Himiko laughs a little, and then, she’s quiet. “I… I really did think I was going to die back then, you know. During the big fight. I wanted to.”\n\nOchako doesn’t say anything. She doesn’t need to. She just keeps stroking Himiko’s hair.\n\n“I was so ready to give my life to save yours. I couldn’t let you die because of me, and if it meant I wouldn’t be locked away, then I thought it had to be the best option. But I lived. And—and I spent so many days alone thinking that it would have been better if I didn’t. You wouldn’t have to waste your time visiting me every month and I would have died happy instead of being forced to be miserable every day.”\n\nShe holds onto Ochako tighter, as if letting go means she’ll slip away forever. “But now… I’m glad I’m here. Because I get to have a future. And that future gets to have you in it, even if I don’t know what I want it to look like.”\n\n“We can figure it out along the way,” Ochako says. “Although, I think I might know a good place for us to start.”\n\nThat piques her interest. “You do? Where?” she asks.\n\n“There’s this project I’ve been working on for a while now that I think you’d really like to help with… but I’ll tell you about it in the morning,” Ochako says, shaking her head. “Explaining it involves a lot of really boring legal stuff, and that’s the last thing we should be talking about after sex.”\n\nIt’s a satisfying enough answer for Himiko, who gives a hum of approval and nuzzles herself further against Ochako’s chest. “Tomorrow morning will be the first time I wake up outside of a cell in forever. I’m glad you’ll be there for it,” she says. “I’m not really sure how I want to spend the day, though.”\n\n“We can do anything you want. Just say the word and I’ll make it happen.”\n\n“Then… I want to go shopping. I need a new wardrobe, ‘cause my old clothes either don’t fit me anymore or are way out of style.” She huffs. “And I don’t care if people give us trouble for being out in public. It’s our life, and we can live it our way.”\n\nOchako’s heart flutters at that. Our life. It sounds poetic. Himiko once nearly stole her life before coming close to to giving her own so that Ochako might live, and now, they would have a life together not as hero and villain, but as… what? Girlfriends? No, that isn’t the word—it’s too twee, not sufficient enough to truly encapsulate what they share. Lovers, then, or maybe partners. Regardless of a label, they’re together now, in body and in heart, and that’s what really matters.\n\n“Live our way,” Ochako echoes, “and love our way, too.” She presses a kiss to the crown of Himiko’s head and looks through the window shutters at the moon hanging above, shining white in a sea of black. It seems bigger somehow. Fuller.\n\nAnd yet, bright and beautiful as it may be, nothing compares to the sun in her arms."
