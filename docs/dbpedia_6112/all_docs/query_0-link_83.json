        "text": "By Nina Phillips |\n\nIn just a few months, the new My Hero Academia movie, My Hero Academia: You’re Next, is set to release in Canada and North America. The movie has already started its theatrical release in Japan. While fans have a little longer to wait, they can tide themselves over with the new trailer filled with exciting clips.\n\nThe film is set to take place between Season 6 and Season 7 of the anime. In My Hero Academia: You’re Next, a new villain threatens the world, and it’s up to the young heroes to save the day alongside their idols. Interestingly, this film offers a take on what would happen if All Might was the main enemy.\n\nThe trailer for My Hero Academia: You’re Next is full of some very intense moments as the heroes work to save people and fight hordes of enemies. There are also several new powers on the enemy’s side that no hero is prepared for.\n\nIn My Hero Academia: You’re Next, a new villain threatens the world, and it’s up to the young heroes to save the day alongside their idols.\n\nThe enemy, known as Dark Might, has created his persona based on a twisted perspective of the popular hero All Might. In the trailer for My Hero Academia: You’re Next, you see many scenes featuring Dark Might and the students of 1-A as they fight. There are also clips featuring a girl who seems to be trapped by Dark Might, though her purpose in the story is unclear at the moment.\n\nHere is the official synopsis of My Hero Academia: You’re Next, the fourth movie in the My Hero Academia franchise: “Next, it’s your turn! In a society where heroes and villains continuously battle in the name of peace and chaos, Deku, a U.A. High School student who aspires to be the best hero he can be, confronts the villain who imitates the hero he’s long admired. Can Deku and the rest of U.A. High Class 1-A protect the world by putting an end to Dark Might, the man claiming to be the new Symbol of Peace?”\n\nMy Hero Academia: You’re Next is set to release in North America on October 11, 2024.\n\nAlso in the trailer was a theme song for My Hero Academia: You’re Next, called “Homunculus” by Vaundy, who also did the opening for Ranking of Kings, a song in One Piece Film: Red, and the ending for Chainsaw Man, amongst others.\n\nMy Hero Academia: You’re Next will not only arrive in America only two months later than the original Japanese release but there will be showings in English dub and Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nMy Hero Academia: You’re Next is set to release in North America on October 11, 2024. As of August 2, 2024, the movie has already started its Japanese theatrical release. This is a pretty quick release time for North America, only running about two months behind the official Japanese release, showing just how well this movie is expected to be received.\n\nMy Hero Academia: You’re Next will not only arrive in America only two months later than the original Japanese release but there will be showings in English dub and Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nFor those listening to the film in Japanese, the cast will include all of the original voice actors, including Daiki Yamashita (Yowamushi Pedal) as Deku, Nobuhiko Okamoto (Blue Exorcist) as Dynamight, Yuki Kaji (The Heroic Legend of Arslan) as Shoto, Ayane Sakura (The Quintessential Quintuplets) as Uravity and Kaito Ishikawa (Haikyuu!!) as Ingenium. In addition to these familiar favorites, Mamoru Miyano (Chihayafuru) and Meru Nukumi (Love’s in Sight!) are joining the cast of My Hero Academia: You’re Next as two brand-new characters: Giulio Handini and Anna Scervino.\n\nLooking to catch up on all the episodes before My Hero Academia: You’re Next comes out? The My Hero Academia series is available on Crunchyroll. While you don’t have to watch the movie to understand what’s happening in Season 7, with as many epic fight scenes as the trailer shows, fans aren’t going to want to miss it."
