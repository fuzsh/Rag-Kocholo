I can’t find it anywhere. They had it in a couple “Blockbusters” back in Toronto. Unfortunately I haven’t seen it since. It’s a British film. Extremely dark. Awesome. Had the actor who portray Brick Top in it as well as one of the guys from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels as the lead role. I’d love to know where to find it. There’s one scene where he walks into a room…shots or stabs (can’t remember) a dude then proceeds to undress. When completely naked he unrolls a knife set and continues to slowly kill this dude. The camera’s perspective was of the man being killed. Chilling. Good story. Amazing. Jealousy, Rise and Fall, to eventual self destruction.\n\nL4yer Cake. Just out on DVD. Outstanding. A new Steve McQueen, they’re calling the lead. Maybe, maybe not – they’re some pretty big boots to fill. But I can see why they say it.\n\nLockstock & Snatch producer turns his hand to directing.

You have to see this flick if you don’t have the slightest. Thanks for the recommendation.\n\nI just felt like mentioning that my list of movies are my favorates because I have experienced similar aspects that have literally turned my stomach. So my films are alittle darker than most with the exception of Guy Ritchie’s flicks. Although they were violent they had a huge sense of ironic humor.\n\nI like how Tarantino uses influences. The Kill Bill series was a good example. He used Bruce Lee films and various other Kung FOOEY movies as influences. You can also sense his asian methods of story telling. Plots and storylines. Symbolism."
