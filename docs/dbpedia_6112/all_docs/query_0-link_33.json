        "text": "Who doesn't love a punchy gangster action entertainer? Certainly, Indian cinema does. We always have had a penchant for gangster or underworld films and there are quite a few films that are inspired by real-life gangsters. Here’s a compilation of 10 films that became huge hits for depicting true-to-life versions of Indian gangsters.\n\nWhen trolls forced these celebs flee social media\n\nSetting a new benchmark for gangster films, Anurag Kashyap’s Gangs of Wasseypur, which focused on the coal mafia of Dhanbad, earned critical acclaim. The film featured a stellar cast, including the likes of Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Huma Qureshi, Richa Chadda and Tigmanshu Dhulia in lead roles. Telling the story of war between criminal dynasties, Gangs of Wasseypur was praised for its gripping narrative and thrilling plot dynamics. Apart from being commercially successful, the film won numerous accolades at film festivals and also went on to bag several awards.\n\nIn this Nikhil Advani film, late actor Rishi Kapoor portrays Iqbal Seth alias Goldman, a Pakistani mobster. Some Indian agents are on a mission to capture Iqbal, who is wanted in a number of instances throughout the country. Kapoor's attire made it evident that his persona was modelled on a Mumbai criminal. The film was a mild box-office hit and poked fun at the media frenzy surrounding gangsters' lives.\n\nThe film featuring Alia Bhatt in a never-seen-avatar evoked curiosity ever since it was announced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The biographical drama is set in the 1960s and its plot revolves around a young woman, Gangubai, who ran the brothels in Mumbai's Kamathipura in the 60s. It is based on a chapter of Hussain Zaidi's book called Mafia Queens of Mumbai. It’s an Alia Bhatt show all the way, as she slips into the role of the bosslady in a world-full of brothels and lustful men.\n\nThis film traces the growth of Mumbai’s underworld, and is said to be based on real-life gangsters Haji Mastan and Dawood Ibrahim. Featuring Ajay Devgan, Emraan Hashmi, Prachi Desai, Kangana Ranaut and Randeep Hooda in lead roles, 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai' was a box office hit. The extremely dramatic narrative and whistle-worthy dialogues made this film an interesting watch. Though the film received much appreciation, its sequel 'Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara' failed to create any magic at the box office.\n\nThe film was directed by Apoorva Lakhia. The crime drama was based on the true life of don Dawood Ibrahim's sister Haseena Parkar. It starred actress Shraddha Kapoor in the lead role. The story revolves around how she starts to face troubles in the underworld after her brother flees the country after the 1993 blasts.\n\nDirector Mahesh Manjrekar’s 'Vaastav: The Reality' is believed to be loosely based on the life of underworld gangster Chota Rajan. This hard-hitting film delves into the realities of the underworld. Known to be one of Sanjay Dutt’s best performances, Vaastav was successful in its attempt to show that the underworld is not just about bloody fights, but consisted of human beings who are capable of emotions.\n\nThis biographical action drama starred actor Arjun Rampal in the lead role. The film directed by Ashim Ahluwalia is biographical about the incredible true story of Arun Gawli, who grew up in Mumbai's destitute Dagdi Chawl and went on to become a feared don, politician, and competitor of India's most powerful crime lord, Dawood Ibrahim, stretching through the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSanjay Gupta’s Shootout at Wadala is regarded to be based on the life of Manya Surve, a Mumbai-based gangster. This film brings to the large screen the first-ever registered encounter of Mumbai police, during the course of which gangster Manya Surve was shot dead. This film was liked by the audience and was commercially successful as well. A sequel to Shootout at Lokhandwala, this film, featuring John Abraham in the lead role, is also said to be loosely based on Hussain Zaidi’s book Dongri to Dubai.\n\nIn the film 'Shootout at Lokhandwala', Vivek Oberoi essayed the role of Maya Dolas, an underworld goon who is looked after by his mother. The film is based on the Lokhandwala Complex shootout that took place in 1991. Shootout at Lokhandwala saw some fine performances, including that of Amrita Singh as Aai and Sanjay Dutt as the Additional Commissioner of Police. Most of the scenes in this film were shot at the actual location where the shootout took place."
