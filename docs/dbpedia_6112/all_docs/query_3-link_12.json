        "text": "Since the earliest days of cinema, gangsters have been the characters weâve both loved and loved to hate. During the era of the Production Code, the heyday of the âgangster film,â Hollywood ensured that they were always brought to justice. But the popularity of their stories almost always owed more to the criminal exploits that led up to that moral reckoning, long after theyâd won audiencesâ admiration, envy, or even love. Their role was playing societyâs outlaw, and their responsibility was to clash with its values to accomplish their own nefarious goals. That journey has endlessly fascinated viewers as a vicarious thrill, an escapist fantasy, or a truly primitive tale of good and evil.\n\nWhen the Code lost its authority over film productions and stories about gangsters proliferated across the globe, portraits of their behavior, both good and bad, took on even more complex, ambiguous dimensions. Where once they were gleefully flaunting societyâs rules, some gangsters sought legitimate pathsâonly to discover that their opportunities for success demanded that they cut a few corners or make deals with unsavory types; and some unsavory types upheld a certain code of honor that their supposedly law-abiding counterparts seemed to be challenging.\n\nMaking a list of the best gangster movies is tough, because there are lots of movies that overlap with this category without quite hitting the target. There are dozens of incredible heist movies, for example, and many others that study the criminal mindset without quite qualifying their characters as âgangsters.â But the films below explore the gangster as both a character and an idea at its fullest, most vivid, and most resounding. These 20 films are proof that crime pays off handsomely onscreenâeven if we wouldnât necessarily want to follow in their footsteps.\n\n1. Public Enemy (1931)\n\nBased on Beer and Blood, an unpublished novel written by two former newspapermen, William A. Wellmanâs pre-Code gangster film gave James Cagney the role that would define his career. The story of a young gangsterâs rise during Prohibition, Wellmanâs film drew inspiration from real-life individuals and true stories from the heyday of Al Caponeâs rivalries in Chicago.\n\nWellman cemented Cagneyâs stardom after swapping his and co-star Edward Woodsâs roles, but subjected the young actor to a number of dangerous scenarios, including a real punch to the mouth and a set riddled with live ammunition. Meanwhile, Cagneyâs feverish intensity paved the way for decades of gangster roles as bracing and unforgettable as the grapefruit that he iconically smashes in co-star Mae Clarkeâs face.\n\n2. White Heat (1949)\n\nJames Cagney became known for tough guy roles in the early days of Hollywood talkies, giving audiences someone whose criminal exploits they could cheer forâat least until the Production Code imposed strict guidelines to ensure no one wanted to emulate him in real life. In his comeback with Warner Bros., Cagney plays psychotic hoodlum Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett, whose fixation with his mother leads him deeper and deeper into trouble. Cagneyâs refrain from the filmââMade it, Ma! Top of the world!ââbecame an instant catchphrase that echoed throughout film history in other films like Ernest Dickersonâs Juice, thanks to the actorâs unforgettable appeal giving the doomed crook glory, even in a tragic death at the hands of the authorities.\n\n3. Bonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\nCharacterized as a ârallying cryâ announcing the New Hollywood era at a time already full of turbulent change, Arthur Pennâs chronicle of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) inches toward the more open portrayals of sex and violence that the Production Code prohibited, and this filmâs enormous success enabled later on. Beatty and Dunaway are sexy and mesmerizing as the tragic duo, following a foolhardy dream of becoming bank robbers to escape the boredom of their poverty-stricken lives, bringing Clydeâs equally reckless brother (Gene Hackman), his disapproving wife (Estelle Parsons), and an impressionable kid along for their doomed ride. In a genre dominated by mythmaking, Pennâs film tells how these two outlaws wrote their own story.\n\n4. Get Carter (1971)\n\nBritish crime exploded in popularity in the late 1960s and â70s, and Michael Caine was often the face of its jazziest, most violent expressions. In this adaptation of a 1970 Ted Lewis novel, Caine plays Jack Carter, a London gangster who travels home to discover that his brother was murderedâand decides to take revenge. Working with director Mike Hodges (who later directed the exceptional Croupier with Clive Owen), Caine aimed to deliver a more hardened, gritty portrayal of criminal behavior than he had in previous films like the brisker, more fun The Italian Job, even drawing upon real-life acquaintances he had with underworld types. Meanwhile, Hodgesâs use of local bystanders as extras and a cinematographer with previous experience in documentary film further demystifies and grounds the action in this frequently brutal, amoral tale.\n\n5. The Godfather (1972)\n\nDespite the Italian-American Civil Rights Leagueâs insistence that any mention of mafia and cosa nostra be excised from Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzoâs story about the fictional Corleone family, no film has become more synonymous with organized crimeâand indeed, the mobâthan this sweeping drama. Coppola cemented not only his own career but those of Al Pacino, John Cazale, and others with a complex portrait of a family hierarchy where some members eagerly join the âfamily businessâ and others struggle against it. An entire legacy of gangster-inspired filmmaking can be traced back to The Godfather, perhaps appropriately, as so much of it is about legacies inherited, defined, and forgedâto say nothing of the fact that it features some of the most exceptional writing, acting, and directing in cinema history.\n\n6. Battles Without Honor And Humanity (1973)\n\nTechnically, Battles Without Honor and Humanity is not just one film, but five shot by director Kinji Fukasaku in less than two years. It examines the evolution of warrior codesâfrom sword fights to gunfightsâin a post-WWII Hiroshima. Inspired by a series of nonfiction magazine articles, Fukasaku aims not only for an artful interpretation of real events, but utilizes narration, newsreel data, and other techniques to give his storytelling a vivid sense of authenticity. Meanwhile, the seriesâ violent landscapes track much more than a single gangsterâs journey through an unforgiving criminal community, embracing and exploring the hierarchies, the power plays, and the bodies left behind the in the wake of the Yakuzaâs march toward dominanceâand perhaps self-destructionâat all costs.\n\n7. The Friends Of Eddie Coyle (1973)\n\nSo many gangster stories are about low-level hoods and their attempts to navigate their way up the chain of commandâto outsmart or outshoot people literally gunning for their job, or their stash. This Peter Yates film follows the title character, an aging delivery truck driver (played by the great Robert Mitchum), as he attempts to satisfy his criminal bosses while avoiding a pending jail stretch that will almost certainly kill him. Heists, double-crosses, and arrests multiply as poor, increasingly drunk Eddie tries to negotiate with an ATF agent who expects him to work as an informer, without betraying the confidence of a local bar owner (Peter Boyle) who he doesnât know has already betrayed him. With its slow and sad end for an old man hanging on to his last scraps of life, the film depicts a much less noble career in crime than some other examples, which at least offer glory before that precipitous fall.\n\n8. The Godfather Part II (1974)\n\nAfter examining the path of Italian-Americans and the immigrant experience in the early 1900s with The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola complemented that crime saga with a story inseparable from the fabric of the country in its sequel, following Michael Corleoneâs journey at the head of the Corleone family while chronicling his father Vitoâs humble origins in the America. Parallel journeys charted by Pacino and Robert De Niro spotlight how intrinsically immigrant lives are woven into the fabric of the country, and many industries that seem âlegit,â while Coppola wields his scalpel carving away the last remnants of Michaelâs humanity that his father was able to preserve for himself, and had once tried to protect for his children.\n\n9. The Long Good Friday (1980)\n\nThe idea of âgoing legitâ is one that is regularly explored in gangster movies, but few do it more effectively than in this British film about Harry Shand (an electrifying Bob Hoskins) and his imploded aspirations to become a businessman. Capturing the energy of late 1970s London, and the many issues that dominated the social landscape of the era, director John Mackenzie shunts Harry first through an intriguing mysteryâwho committed the murders disrupting his world?âtoward an explosive climax between him and no less than the IRA, with his relationship with the American mafia staking his bid for legitimacy hanging in the balance.\n\n10. Once Upon a Time in America (1984)\n\nSergio Leone turned down the chance to direct The Godfather to focus on his own crime saga, which he delivered 12 years later as his final film. Different versions forced Once Upon a Time in America to find its audience years after its initial release, but the almost-four hour-long version brought its transcendent virtues vividly into focus. De Niro plays Noodles, a street kid who grows up to become a powerful gangster, only for his scruffy criminal origins to haunt him for the rest of his lifeâincluding keeping him from the life and love he desperately seeks. Ennio Morriconeâs tack-piano score underlines the melancholy failure of a man left penniless and alone by the same criminal pursuits that helped lift him out of squalor, while Leoneâs patience offers a character study that in one operatic swoop encapsulates the achievement of lifelong dreamsâand for some, their inescapable cost.\n\n11. The Untouchables (1987)\n\nWorking in a different mode than his cocaine-fueled Scarface, Brian De Palma focused this period thriller on the good guys rather than the bad ones, but gave them perhaps one of the most infamous real-life gangsters of all time to square off against: Al Capone, played with simmering menace by Robert De Niro. The directorâs homages to classic cinema, such as in the Battleship Potemkin-riffing train station shootout, showcase his effortless craftsmanship. But itâs the battle of wills between Capone, his ruthless henchmen, and Eliot Nessâs upstanding, fearless police unit that gives this film such a lasting charge.\n\n12. Goodfellas (1990)\n\nWhere Coppolaâs Godfather filmsâup to and including Part III in 1990âtried to examine the criminality of the Corleone family from a historical and socioeconomic perspective interlaced with the origins of America itself, Martin Scorseseâs mob masterpiece trekked through the invigorating minutiae of a young lieutenant and his hard-stolen success in a world that didnât recognize his brand of overachieving, which is also why it couldnât stop him sooner. Ray Liottaâs portrayal of mobster (and perhaps, inevitably, informant) Henry Hill jolts through the details of his life of crime, from the wild affluence to the peaks and valleys of living outside the law, while Scorseseâs propulsive direction draws a powerful question mark about whether itâs worse to be a criminal, or just to get caughtâand what each viewerâs answer says about them.\n\n13. King of New York (1990)\n\nFew directors capture the seedy side of New York better than Martin Scorsese, but Abel Ferrara is right up there. In his 1990 crime story, Christopher Walken plays Frank Black, a crime lord recently released from prison who gets in a big hurry to make up for lost time, killing his competitors with ruthless efficiency while frustrating the cops who canât seem to catch him. A murdererâs row of actors poised for their own stardom fill out its ensemble cast, but itâs Walkenâs invigorating unpredictability that elevates his portrayal to classic status, balancing irresistible charisma with an ice-cold sociopathy that leaves audiences on the edgeâafraid but also eager to watch his next move.\n\n14. Millerâs Crossing (1990)\n\nIn their infinite capacity to recreate an anachronistic time and place with such specificity that you feel like youâre there, Joel and Ethan Coen told this particular story early in their career, a featherweight noir about a gangsterâs right-hand man (Gabriel Byrne) and the trouble in which he finds himself after his boss (Albert Finney) and another rival (Jon Polito) go to war over the ne'er-do-well brother (John Turturro) of his sometime lady friend (Marcia Gay Harden). Effortlessly smart, and crackling with the kind of period jargon for which the duo is known, the Coens manage to showcase their protagonistâs endless, inventive maneuvering in a world of shifting loyalties, suggesting that itâs always possible to find another way outâalthough thereâs almost always a punishing beatdown standing in the way.\n\n15. Carlitoâs Way (1993)\n\nThe Brian De Palma-Al Pacino pairing of Scarface is by far the showier, more popular option most might choose on a list of gangster films. But for many viewers, this 1993 effort written by David Koepp is the superior film, in that it keeps Pacino on a tighter leash playing gangster cues in a more minor, albeit more deeply felt, key. As Carlitoâs increasingly corrupt attorney Dave Kleinfeld, Sean Penn enjoys the filmâs biggest opportunity to chew scenery, but even if the film culminates in a blood-soaked race to Penn Station, Pacinoâs turn gives the story a melancholy, reflective edge that makes you want to see him succeed with his modest, post-criminal dreams, even if the legacy he created for himself, and the associations and loyalties he maintains and even enables, prove to be an albatross he just canât quite remove from around his neck.\n\n16. Sexy Beast (2000)\n\nMusic video director Jonathan Glazer made his feature debut with this hypnotic story of a retired gangster (Ray Winstone) enlisted by his decidedly insistent former colleague Don (Ben Kingsley) to stage a robbery at the behest of mob boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane). Winstoneâs understated role as the reluctant bag man opposite Kingsley gives his co-star ample time to destroy the scenery and anything else in his way, but itâs McShane in the Big Bad role of Teddy that underscores the difference between a friend and a boss: You might be afraid to say no to the former, but when it comes to the latter, youâd better just start with yes.\n\n17. City of God (2002)\n\nFernando Meirelles directed this sprawling, propulsive drama about the evolution of gangsters within Brazilâs slums between the 1960s and 1980s, and the growth of organized crime. It follows the cityâs petty thieves, a.k.a. âThe Runts,â as they evade police and accrue the wealth and status that a life of abject poverty refused them an opportunity to earn. Meirelles chronicles the ways that their consolidation of power is met with opposition from both the local, often equally corrupt authorities, and inspires copycats eager to carve out their slice of a very small pie.\n\n18. Infernal Affairs (2002)\n\nAndrew Lau and Alan Mak directed this film that became the inspiration for Martin Scorseseâs first Oscar-winning directorial effort, The Departed. The notion of cops and crooks being opposite sides of the same coin is an idea that has long been explored in cinema, particularly in Hong Kong, but Infernal Affairs gives the contrast explicit dimensions when a cop is sent to infiltrate a Triad at the same time that a low-level Triad member is instructed to become a mole in the police force. The movie reckons brilliantly with the emotional challenges of each of these two characters' undercover work, while shuffling them through scenarios meant to test their ability to maintain their true loyalties, to appear to be faithful to organizations theyâre betraying, and to help catch their counterpart while not getting caught themselves.\n\n19. Eastern Promises (2007)\n\nAfter David Cronenberg more or less incidentally made a gangster movie, a masterpiece in its own right, with A History of Violenceâarguably more about traditions of violence and what they imprint on familiesâhe followed up with this piercing, full-throated story of a Russian mob enforcer (Viggo Mortensen) trying to juggle his responsibilities babysitting his best friend and bossâs petulant son Kiril (Vincent Cassel) while also dealing with the death of a young prostitute whose child leads back to a ring of kidnappings by the mafia. Mortensenâs buck-naked knife fight in a bath house is certainly the filmâs showstopper, but Cronenberg explores the ties that bind, and some that shackle, while delivering a very powerful and evocative study of these characters shaped by privilege and then tested by responsibility.\n\n20. A Prophet (2009)\n\nDirector Jacques Audiard created this story to give images âfor people who donât have images in movies, like the Arabs in France.â Whether itâs a good or bad thing that those images are of people ensconced in criminality, Audiard delivered something extremely powerful, following an angry, naÃ¯ve young convict named Malik (Tahar Rahim) as he becomes part of an organized crime organization while behind bars. Slowly watching and learning as he ascends the ranks beneath his brutal Corsican mob boss, Malik becomes a proxy for the failed, forgotten and seemingly weak who decide to make something of themselves out of sheer determination and willâand sometimes almost without realizing it."
