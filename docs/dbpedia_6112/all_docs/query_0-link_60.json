She stars alongside Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as a trio of office workers who plot revenge against their sexist, egotistical boss. —Mary Sollosi\n\nWhere to watch 9 to 5: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n02 of 33\n\nThe Brave One (2007)\n\nNeil Jordan's New York City thriller The Brave One stars Jodie Foster as a woman who survived an attack that resulted in her fiancé's death. Reeling from the incident, she acquires an illegal firearm and becomes a vigilante, making headlines as she picks off one criminal after another until she finds the men responsible for her loved one's murder. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Brave One: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n03 of 33\n\nCape Fear (1962)\n\nJ. Lee Thompson's 1962 adaptation of James R. Webb's novel The Executioners stars Robert Mitchum as a convicted rapist who, upon being released from prison, seeks vengeance on the lawyer (Gregory Peck) whom he blames for his having received such a harsh sentence. Martin Scorsese remade the thriller in 1991, with Robert De Niro in the Mitchum role and Nick Nolte in Peck's, and featuring both of the original actors in small parts. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Cape Fear: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n04 of 33\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo (2002)\n\nAlexandre Dumas' classic novel has been adapted for the big screen multiple times, but Kevin Reynolds' 2002 swashbuckler stands out the most. Jim Caviezel stars as Edmond Dantès, a trusting young man whose best friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce), falsely frames him for treason. In one of the greatest revenge stories of all time, Edmond escapes from prison, collects an enormous fortune, and gets his sweet vengeance on the traitorous Fernand and his accomplices. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Count of Monte Cristo: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n05 of 33\n\nThe Crow (1994)\n\nSadly, Brandon Lee (Bruce Lee's son) died at age 28 following an accident on the set of Alex Proyas' The Crow, based on the comic by James O'Barr. Lee stars in the film as a rocker who is resurrected by a mystical crow, and then gets his ghostly revenge on the gang who murdered him and his fiancée a year earlier. (Three decades after the original, Rupert Sanders directed a reboot of The Crow, starring Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs.) —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Crow: MGM+\n\n06 of 33\n\nDeath Wish (1974)\n\nMichael Winner kicked off the Death Wish film series (of which he directed the first three movies) with this 1974 actioner, based on Brian Garfield's 1972 novel. Charles Bronson stars as Paul Kersey, a pacifist architect who transforms into a ruthless vigilante when his wife is murdered and his daughter is raped in a home invasion. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Death Wish: PlutoTV\n\n07 of 33\n\nDo Revenge (2022)\n\nIn Jennifer Kaytin Robinson's teen Strangers on a Train-esque comedy, Riverdale's Camila Mendes and Stranger Things' Maya Hawke star as an unlikely team who form a pact to \"do revenge\" on each other's enemies. Mendes slips on the '90s-inspired wardrobe of Drea — a popular scholarship student who is socially exiled once her faux-feminist boyfriend (Austin Abrams) leaks her X-rated tape — while Hawke plays Eleanor, Rosehill Country Day High's new transfer student seeking vengeance on the person who outed her years prior. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch Do Revenge: Netflix\n\n08 of 33\n\nFemme (2023)\n\nDrag superstar Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) embraces his femininity on stage as his femme fatale persona, Aphrodite, and off stage as an out gay man. However, after suffering a vicious homophobic attack, Jules shrinks that aspect of himself and ultimately loses his career. But when he stumbles upon the ringleader of his assailants (George MacKay) in a gay sauna locker room months later, Jules pursues a relationship with him to get the ultimate payback. Directed by Sam H. Freeman and Ng Choon Ping, Femme is not just a revenge film but also offers a subversive and incisive exploration of topics like toxic masculinity, shame, power, and anti-queer violence. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Femme: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n09 of 33\n\nGladiator (2000)\n\nRidley Scott's Oscar-winning historical epic stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman general who is sold and enslaved following the murders of both his own family and the emperor to whom he was loyal. A talented fighter, he becomes a great gladiator and seeks revenge in the arena against the power-hungry new emperor who killed everyone he loved. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Gladiator: Paramount+\n\n10 of 33\n\nThe Godfather (1972)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola's seminal crime drama chronicles the ascent of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), the youngest and brightest son of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) — don of the Corleone crime family — from being outside the family business to taking over as don when his father dies. His evolution from a promising young war vet into a ruthless Mob boss is largely driven by his desire to get revenge on the rival mobsters responsible for the deaths of his wife and brother. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Godfather: Paramount+\n\n11 of 33\n\nHamlet (1996)\n\nO, vengeance! William Shakespeare's great tragedy of the Prince of Denmark revolves around its conflicted hero's desire to avenge his father's murder (by Hamlet's uncle, no less). Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the 1996 adaptation in which he starred, above), Laurence Olivier, Mel Gibson, and Ethan Hawke are among the many A-listers who have portrayed \"the son of a dear father murdered/Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell.\" —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Hamlet: The Roku Channel\n\n12 of 33\n\nIn the Bedroom (2001)\n\nTodd Field made his directorial debut with this tense drama, which premiered at Sundance and went on to pick up five Oscar nominations. A husband and wife (Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek) struggle to cope in the aftermath of the murder of their adult son — until the young man's father takes justice into his own hands. Nothing can assuage the pain of grief quite like revenge. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch In the Bedroom: PlutoTV\n\n13 of 33\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nQuentin Tarantino makes the list twice — first with this bloodbath of a WWII movie, in which Mélanie Laurent plays a Parisian Jewish woman who takes her revenge on the Nazis who killed her family. The worst of them is the opportunistic Hans Landa, the role that won Christoph Waltz his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar (of two) for a performance in a Tarantino film. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Inglorious Basterds: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n14 of 33\n\nJohn Tucker Must Die (2006)\n\nBetty Thomas' high school revenge comedy stars Brittany Snow as a shy new girl at school who joins forces with a cheerleader (Ashanti), an overachiever (Arielle Kebbel), and an activist (Sophia Bush) to get even with the basketball star (Jesse Metcalfe) who cheated on all three of them. Under the guidance of her new friends, Snow's character succeeds in breaking John Tucker's heart, but destroying a man is dirty work. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch John Tucker Must Die: Hulu\n\n15 of 33\n\nJohn Wick (2014)\n\nThe Keanu Reeves-starring John Wick, directed by stuntmen and first-time helmers Chad Stahelski and an uncredited David Leitch, was a surprise hit of 2014. It launched the Keanussaince and exploded into a whole franchise, with sequels in 2017, 2019, and 2023 (all helmed by Stahelski), a videogame, and a TV series at Starz. When mobsters steal John Wick's vintage car and kill the puppy that had been a gift from his wife just before her death, John will stop at nothing to get revenge. Conveniently, he is a former assassin. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch John Wick: Tubi\n\n16 of 33\n\nKill Bill (2003–2004)\n\nQuentin Tarantino's two-part revenge extravaganza, a tribute to exploitation cinema as loving as it is bloody, stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, a jumpsuit-clad murderess hell-bent on vengeance after a team of deadly assassins — of which she used to be a part — tried to kill her and her unborn child on her wedding day. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Kill Bill: Netflix\n\n17 of 33\n\nMemento (2000)\n\nChristopher Nolan got his breakthrough with his second feature, 2000's trippy revenge thriller Memento. Guy Pearce stars as Leonard, a man trying to avenge his wife's death by tracking down her killer. His lack of short-term memory, for which he compensates with tattoos and photographs, informs the film's nonlinear narrative structure. Alternating between the beginning of the story (shown chronologically) and the latter half (presented in reverse), the two narrative threads meet at the end, filling in each other's gaps and solving the final mystery. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Memento: Amazon Prime Video\n\n18 of 33\n\nThe Menu (2022)\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold in Mark Mylod's horror comedy. Skewering class disparities in food consumption and the restaurant industry, The Menu takes place during a single night at Hawthorn — a remote, upscale eatery run by Michelin-star chef Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes) and his subservient crew of cooks. Invited by Julian himself, a group of elite guests sit down for a carefully curated 10-course meal that grows increasingly grotesque and alarming, only to realize too late that they're not there to enjoy fine dining but to get their just desserts. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Menu: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19 of 33\n\nMoby Dick (1956)\n\nHerman Melville's 19th-century masterpiece has been adapted for the screen many times, most notably in 1956 by director John Huston, from a screenplay by Huston and Ray Bradbury. Gregory Peck stars as Captain Ahab, a sea captain consumed by his obsession with hunting down the white whale, Moby Dick, who destroyed his ship and tore off his leg, forcing Ahab to walk — in a cruel bit of irony — on a whalebone prosthesis. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Moby Dick: Tubi\n\n20 of 33\n\nMunich (2005)\n\nSteven Spielberg's Munich, based on George Jonas' aptly-titled nonfiction book Vengeance, tells the true story of the Israeli government's secret revenge mission following the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics, in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September. Eric Bana stars as Avner — the leader of the mission — in the film, which received five Oscar nominations. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Munich: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21 of 33\n\nThe Northman (2022)\n\nBased on the Norse folk tale that inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet and later The Lion King), Robert Eggers' historical epic chronicles the brutal revenge tale of Viking warrior Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård). As a child, Amleth is traumatized after witnessing his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) savagely murder his father (Ethan Hawke) and abduct his mother (Nicole Kidman). Decades later, the now-Herculean and venomous Amleth is reminded of his vow to rescue his mother and exact retribution on his uncle. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Northman: Starz\n\n22 of 33\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\nPark Chan-wook's Oldboy is the second — and most famous — installment in the filmmaker's Vengeance Trilogy. It follows a man (Choi Min-sik) who has been imprisoned in a small room for 15 years, only to be released with no explanation of where he was, who put him there, and why he was made to suffer. Who wouldn't want revenge after that? Spike Lee remade the beloved Korean film in 2013, with Josh Brolin in the lead role. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Oldboy: Netflix\n\n23 of 33\n\nPoint Blank (1967)\n\nLee Marvin stars in John Boorman's moody noir, based on the 1963 Richard Stark novel The Hunter, which was later adapted for the screen again as Brian Helgeland's Payback (1999). Marvin plays Walker, a man seeking revenge on his best friend (John Vernon) who betrayed him and left him for dead after they stole a large amount of money together. —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch Point Blank: Tubi\n\n24 of 33\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\nDon't be turned off from Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride just because it's based on a \"kissing book.\" It's got fencing, fighting, torture, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, and some highly satisfying revenge. Never forget: \"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\" —M.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Princess Bride: Disney+\n\n25 of 33\n\nPromising Young Woman (2020)\n\nOne of the biggest breakouts of the 2020 Sundance Film Festival was the stylish, provocative debut feature from Killing Eve showrunner and The Crown actress Emerald Fennell.
