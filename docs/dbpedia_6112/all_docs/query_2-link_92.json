        "text": "They seize opportunities where they see them and take risks. They don’t fawn over the boss just because he’s the boss. They represent can-do corporate climbing and the celebrated American dream. Yeah, they’ve got a nasty habit of killing people, but nobody’s perfect.\n\nSurfing through the nine films in Warner’s two new Blu-ray sets, one devoted to classic gangster movies, the other to the more recent model, you’re reminded why you fall for these homicidal lugs in the first place. They achieve success by getting away with what we can’t. Then they pay the price that social order requires. Presto: vicarious thrills and moral righteousness, all in one handy package.\n\nThe template was set by the two earliest films here, Little Caesar and The Public Enemy, both from 1931, both making their Blu-ray debut.\n\nEdward G. Robinson's Rico \"Caesar\" Bandello and James Cagney's Tom Powers recognize Prohibition as their avenue to the top. They start among the workers, then, as capitalism dictates, they make their bootlegging move. Their ambition was shared by the early movie moguls, who came from immigrant stock and quickly set to work getting rich. (It's also shared by Paul Muni's Tony Camonte, who sadly couldn't make this sit-down: Scarface (1932), the best of the big three early gangster movies, isn't a Warner title.)\n\nAs these sets make clear, Warner Bros. all but defined the genre from the get-go. But gangster movies are hardly monolithic. Like any genre, this one underwent fascinating mutations over the years.\n\nThe mama's boy inclinations hinted at in the early films take precedence in 1949's White Heat, also making its Blu-ray debut here. Cagney's Cody Jarrett may run his troops, but it's clear that his domineering mom (Margaret Wycherly) is running the show, especially when poor Cody falls into one of his migrainelike spells. This mother-son gangster dynamic would reach its apotheosis 50 years later with The Sopranos.\n\nThe gangster movie can also adapt to the zeitgeist. Little Caesar and Scarface presented striving takes on Al Capone and compelled us to root for the bad guy. The Untouchables in 1987, featured in the Contemporary set, makes Capone (Robert De Niro) the unquestioned villain and foil to the real protagonists, a federal cop squad led by Kevin Costner as the proudly square Eliot Ness. At the height of Reagan America, a gangster is a gangster is a gangster. No ambiguity needed.\n\nThe real star of the second set isn't a criminal or a cop. It's Martin Scorsese, who claims three of the five featured films — Mean Streets, GoodFellas and The Departed.\n\nScorsese, the film-school brat who studied the movie gangsters after growing up with the real deal in Little Italy, brought stylized realism and psychological depth to the genre. His gangsters are hustlers and midlevel toilers just looking to get ahead. Charlie, Harvey Keitel's character in Mean Streets, is tortured and torn between his hooligan friends and his Catholic faith. In GoodFellas, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill is in it for the perks: the money, the meals, the drugs, the ease of slipping everyone a twenty as a gorgeous tracking shot guides him and his date through the kitchen of the Copacabana.\n\nAs a member of the film-school generation, Scorsese also imbued his gangsters with a certain movie awareness. When the hoods in Mean Streets bilk some kids, they use the cash to go to the movies. \"Jimmy was the kind who rooted for the bad guys in the movies,\" Henry Hill says of his associate, Jimmy Conway (De Niro again). When Henry's psycho pal Tommy (Joe Pesci) blows a waiter's foot off, he evokes the Cagney-Bogart movie The Oklahoma Kid.\n\nIn his own way, Scorsese is reminding us that the movie gangster is but an artistic construct. Taken as a whole, these movies remind us why that construct remains so alluring.\n\nFollow Chris Vognar on Twitter at @chrisvognar.\n\nNew Blu-ray collections\n\nUltimate Gangsters Collection: Classic (Little Caesar, The Public Enemy, The Petrified Forest, White Heat).
