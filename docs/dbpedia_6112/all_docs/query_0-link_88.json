        "text": "Superhero Definition\n\nHow do we define superhero?\n\nFrom Marvel to D.C. and everything in between, superheroes have become a significant part of mainstream culture. Comic books, movies and television are just a few of the places you will find superheroes. Before we can understand why, we must know what a superhero is.\n\nSUPERHERO DEFINITION\n\nWhat is a Superhero?\n\nA superhero is a character with extraordinary powers that performs heroic actions. Unlike police, firefighters or doctors, all of whom are heroes in their own right, superheroes are defined by their unique capabilities, such flight, strength, speed or invincibility (to name a few). Superheroes are also expected to act on a strict moral code. They are always categorized as “good” and rarely, if ever, stray from this path. Finally, a superhero needs to be sympathetic. If the audience cannot identify with the character, then the superhero isn’t much of a hero at all.\n\nTypes of Superheroes:\n\nGod/Goddess: These are supremely powerful beings that are born with numerous powers (Superman, Wonder Woman and Thor).\n\nGadget User: These characters usually lack superpowers, but make up for it with skill, cunning and technology (Batman, Iron Man and Black Widow).\n\nSpeedster: These heroes rely on super speed to overwhelm the bad guys and solve their problems (The Flash and Quicksilver).\n\nMagic User: With a reliance on magic and spells, these characters' powers are often only limited by their imaginations and will power (Dr. Strange and Green Lantern).\n\nPower House: These heroes use unbridled strength and endurance to smash the opposition (The Hulk and the Tick).\n\nShapeshifter: Able to change their size and form at will, giving them unparalleled adaptability (Plastic Man and Ant-Man).\n\nSupernatural: Their powers come from a world beyond the mortal plane (Ghost Rider and Spawn).\n\nOf course, these are just a sample of superhero examples. To help visualize these different types of superheroes, we've put together a collection using StudioBinder's shot listing software. Click the image below to see the entire collection, where you can also download a PDF for future reference.\n\nSuper Hero Characters • Shot Listed in StudioBinder\n\nSuperhero Characteristics\n\nWhat makes a Superhero?\n\nWhat is the difference between a hero and a superhero? As previously stated, the three superhero characteristics that are most important are powers/abilities, morality and sympathy.\n\nSuperpowers can come from a myriad of sources. Some are born with their gifts, such as mutants in the X-Men series. Or, there can be a freak accident that blesses them with special gifts, such as a radioactive spider biting Peter Parker. Superpowers are a key factor of what makes a hero super, because this is the first thing that draws in an audience.\n\nWhat is a Superhero • Superhero Origin in Spider Man\n\nMany people dream of doing the impossible, be it flying around the world, or picking up a truck with ease, because fantasy helps us escape from the harsh reality of our world. The more interesting a superpower is, the better.\n\nTurning water into yogurt may make for a fun party trick, but it doesn't make for much of a superhero.\n\nMorality is another important element in most superhero characteristics. The characters we look up to in fiction (or even in real life) are often a reflection of the person we want to be. That is why superheroes are always the “good guys’” in a story. The majority of humanity strives to do good in this world.\n\nHowever, our flaws and mistakes create a world full of difficulty, struggle and strife. The superheroes we admire can fight terrorism or save loved ones from burning buildings, because we can’t. Superheroes stand for truth and justice in a world that needs both of those things.\n\nRead The Black Panther script and you'll find a hero with internal conflict. Watch the best Superhero movies and you'll discover there is a humanity to these characters that keep them grounded.\n\nWith that said, there needs to be realism in the superheroes we look up to. A hero with “perfect” morality is boring, predictable and unbelievable. It’s a paradox of humanity: we want to do good, but we often do the opposite. A well written superhero has flaws and makes mistakes.\n\nHere is a video on Stan Lee’s superhero definition.\n\nStan Lee on what makes a Superhero\n\nThis is what makes them sympathetic and relatable. Vigilantes like Batman and Daredevil break the law to fight crime, because the justice system they are protecting is broken. Tony Stark is a narcissist and an alcoholic. Black Widow used to be a spy and an assassin till she turned her life around.\n\nOftentimes it is the humanity of a superhero that makes them so likable. Seeing them in believable situations that you and I experience on a daily basis makes them feel real. Spider-Man fights crime in his spare time, but also has to deal with high school drama. Wonder Woman has to live a normal life despite being an immortal goddess. It is the combination of both the normal and the super that makes a hero truly spectacular.\n\nWHO WAS THE FIRST SUPERHERO?\n\nWho was the first Superhero?\n\nWhen you ask someone who the first superhero was, most people will say Superman. While this answer is not entirely wrong, it’s not exactly right.\n\nThere were many “prototype” superheroes that came before Superman. Characters such as Hugo Hercules and Tarzan adorned newspapers and magazines. The Green Hornet and the Lone Ranger wowed audiences on the radio. There were even comic book heroes who arrived before Superman, such as Doctor Occult and Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.\n\nThat being said, Superman is the first true superhero, as he would become the basis for every superhero that would soon follow.\n\nAny Superhero definition starts with the Man of Steel\n\nSuperman first appeared on the cover of a D.C. published comic book called Action Comics #1 in 1938. These panels covered the now famous origin story of the last son of Krypton. A baby is placed in a spaceship to escape a dying world. On Earth, the child would grow and develop magnificent powers, changing the course of history.\n\nAs a champion of the oppressed, Superman would take the superhero genre to new heights. Detective Comics would go on to create some of the most popular superheroes ever, such as Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash.\n\nOf course, with success comes rivalry. A comic book company known as Timely Comics produced various publications. While it would never achieve the same success as D.C. However, the company would hang on and eventually begin publishing under a new name, Marvel Comics.\n\nA History of Superheroes • Marvel Comics Timeline\n\nStan Lee and Jack Kirby would go on to write tiles such as the Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man. Marvel would go on to become D.C.’s primary competition, arguably surpassing them in the current age of movies and media.\n\nSUPERVILLAINS\n\nWhat is a superhero without a villain?\n\nAs Vision once said, “Our very strength incites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict...breeds catastrophe.” Compelling heroes need compelling villains. Common thugs and mobsters only go so far. If a superhero is to be truly tested, both in power and morality, they need to fight a villain who is as strong or stronger than they are. In storytelling, we refer to this relationship as the battle between the protagonist and the antagonist.\n\nThe greatest supervillains are more than just the “bad guy of the week.” They are either the antithesis of superheroes, or a corrupted version of them. Superman is a peacekeeper and protector of humanity. Lex Luthor believes Superman is the greatest threat to humanity. So, he has taken it upon himself to destroy Superman by any means necessary.\n\nBoth Professor X and Magneto want to build a better world for mutants. However, one wants to do so through peace, while the other wants a violent uprising. Whatever a supervillain’s motivation is, it needs to bring them into direct conflict with a superhero.\n\nA great hero can only be truly tested by a great nemesis. In this breakdown of Avengers Infinity War, we look at how Thanos was more than just a villain. In fact, he is actually the protagonist of that particular story, with goals, motivations, and a substantial character arc.\n\nTypes of Superheroes — The Villain Protagonist • Subscribe on YouTube"
