        "text": "Mafia movies, a subcategory of movies on gangsters, are also a subgenre of crime films dealing with organized crime mafia. Particularly in the early films, there is substantial overlap with the noir movie. Popular variants of the genre include Italian Poliziotteschi, Chinese Triad films, japanese movies of the Yakuza and also films of the Indian abyss of Mumbai. In the genre of mafia movies some of the masterpieces to see absolutely.\n\nWhat Does Mafia Mean\n\nMafia” is a term that is used to define criminal organizations that have a resemblance to the Italian mafia. The main task of such organizations is to generate profit through illegal trade and crimes with the use of violence. Mafias often participate in illegal activities such as gambling, financial scams, drug trafficking, extortion, blackmail and fraud. Today, the ‘Ndrangheta, originating from the southern Italian area of ​​Calabria, is considered the richest and most powerful mafia in the world. The term “mafia” it was initially used only for the Italian mafia and derives from Sicily, but has actually expanded to incorporate various other similar organizations, e.g. “the Russian mafia” or “the Japanese mafia”.\n\nThe term is used informally by the press and the public; criminal companies themselves have their own terms: for example, the Sicilian mafia and related Italian-American mafia describe their companies as “Cosa Nostra”; the “Japanese mafia” calls themselves “Ninkyō dantai” but are much more commonly referred to as “Yakuza” by the public; the “Russian mafia” usually calls itself “Bratva”. The term “mafia” commonly describes the Sicilian mafia or the Italian-American mafia, as well as in some cases Italian organized crime in general: Camorra, ‘Ndrangheta, etc…\n\nThe First Mafia Movies\n\nThe American film The Black Hand (1906) is believed to be the first mafia movie. In 1912, D. W. Griffith filmed The Musketeers of Pig Street, a short crime film on the streets of New York City that is said to actually consist of real mobsters as a supporting cast. Some film critics have mentioned Regrowth (1915) as an early mob film.\n\nmafia movies originated in the silent film era but the genre developed in the very early 1930s. The success was due to the financial and social instability caused by the Great Depression, which increased the mafia subculture in the United States. The failure of direct efforts and financial investments to secure some economic protection has led to situations that are mirrored in the wave of mafia movies in Hollywood and also their appeal in a society disillusioned with the American way of life.\n\nMafia Movies in the 1930s\n\nThe years 1931 and 1932 saw the style spawn 3 classic mob films: Little Caesar, The Public Enemy, starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, and also Scarface by Howard Hawks with Paul Muni. These films chronicle the rapid growth, as well as the rapid failure, of 3 young mobsters, and also represent the category in its purest form. The mobster in each film faces a ferocious failure told to warn the public of the repercussions of the crime, like a real propaganda for the formation of the masses through cinema. Target markets were usually able to relate to the charming anti-hero. Those who have experienced Depression have had the ability to connect to the personality of the mobster who strives to achieve his position and success, only to subsequently lose everything he has won.\n\nSuch films had to consistently end with the main mobster character dying in a storm of bullets in the film’s finale starting with the production code. The main character of the film constantly somehow “deviated” from the standards of American culture. In Little Caesar, it is clearly hinted that Caesar Enrico Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) is gay as he is clearly envious when his handsome friend Joe Massaria (Douglas Fairbanks Jr) seductively dances with his fan Olga (Glenda Farrell), which prompts him to make his first significant mistake which causes his failure. In The Public Enemy, the main character Tom Powers (James Cagney) is a misogynist. In Scarface, Tony Carmonte (Paul Muni) has a thinly veiled incestuous interest in his sister Cesca (Ann Dvorak), which results in her death. Some suggest that mafia movie in its purest form only existed until 1933, when production code limitations conditioned films that didn’t have the same power as their predecessors.\n\nHere is a list of mafia movies to see, with a clarification: often mafia movies and gangster films are confused and overlapped by both audiences and critics, especially outside Italy, and perceived as a single genre. Even if we insert some American films of the 30s that are more attributable to gangster films for their importance in the origins of the film genre, the mafia movies are something different. Mafia movies focus more on the most famous criminal organizations and their internal dynamics rather than the life of an underworld gangster. Mafia movies focus on the Italian or Italian-American mafia, the Camorra, the Ndrangheta, or the Chinese and Japanese mafia. There is therefore a subtle difference between gangster films and mafia movies.\n\nLittle Caesar (1931)\n\nIt is a 1931 American pre-Code mafia movie released by Warner Brothers, directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Edward G. Robinson, Glenda Farrell and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The film tells the story of a mobster who rises through the ranks of society until he reaches its upper echelons. The story was adapted from the book of the same name by William R. Burnett. Little Caesar was Robinson’s debut role and immediately established him as a major movie star. The film is often regarded as one of the very first full-fledged mafia movies and continues to be well received by critics. In 2000, Little Caesar was included in the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry’s annual selection of 25 films as being considered “culturally, traditionally, or visually noteworthy”.\n\nThe Public Enemy (1931)\n\nIt is a 1931 American pre-Code mafia movie produced and distributed by Warner Bros. The film was directed by William A. Wellman and starring James Cagney, Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Donald Cook and Joan Blondell. The film tells the story of a boy’s rise in the mafia in Prohibition-era metropolitan America. Supporting actors are Beryl Mercer, Murray Kinnell and Mae Clarke. The screenplay for the film is based on an unpublished book – Beer and Blood by 2 previous journalists, John Bright and Kubec Glasmon – who had actually seen some of Al Capone’s murderous gangs in Chicago. In 1998, The Public Enemy was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as “culturally, traditionally, or visually substantial”.\n\nScarface (1932)\n\nScarface is a 1932 American mafia movie directed by Howard Hawks and produced by Hawks and Howard Hughes. The film’s screenplay, by Ben Hecht, is loosely based on the 1929 book Armitage Trail, inspired by Al Capone. The film stars Paul Muni as Italian immigrant mobster Antonio “Tony” Camonte, a gangster who rises strongly through Chicago’s organized crime, with a supporting cast consisting of George Raft and Boris Karloff. Camonte’s rise to power coincides with his relentless pursuit of his employer’s fiancée, while his sister falls for his best hitman. In clear connection with Capone’s life, a scene portrays a variation of the Valentine’s Day massacre.\n\nIn the Name of the Law (1948)\n\nSicily, 1948: a young magistrate from Palermo is sent as magistrate to Capodarso, a small Sicilian village and, out of love for justice and legality, he finds himself called to fight against numerous social oppressions. His passion will lead him to clash against a notable, Baron Lo Vasto and against the mafia, represented by the farmer Turi Passalacqua and his men. All surrounded by an extremely distrustful and complicit community that prevents its work. Alone against everyone, flanked by the marshal of the Carabinieri regional station and his young friend Paolino, whose barbaric killing will convince him to give up his resignation, will he carry out his fight to the end which consists not only in using the law, but also in teaching its value. A work fascinating in its spectacularity but extremely ambiguous from an ideological point of view, it is an energetic action film, the leader of the Italian civil cinema of the Sixties and the very first western of post-war Italian cinema.\n\nThe Magistrate (1959)\n\nThe Magistrate is a 1959 mafia movie directed by Luigi Zampa and played by Alberto Sordi, who plays the role of an investigating judge in Milan. The film is a satirical comedy that explores the world of Italian justice at the time.\n\nThe plot follows Judge Del Popolo (played by Sordi), who is transferred to a small town in Southern Italy where he has to investigate a murder case. The judge faces many difficulties in trying to get justice due to the corruption and mafia influence on local politics.\n\nThe film highlights the contrast between legality and illegality, between justice and injustice, and between Northern and Southern Italy. Del Popolo’s character represents honesty and integrity in justice, but he has to fight against a corrupt system and against the provincial and traditional mentality of Southern Italy.\n\nIl magistrate was a great success in Italy and received several awards, including the Silver Ribbon for best screenplay in 1960. The film is considered one of Alberto Sordi’s masterpieces and helped to increase his reputation as one of the greatest Italian actors of all time.\n\nMafioso (1962)\n\nMafioso is the film that started the American success of mafia movies. Alberto Sordi provides a remarkable proof of an integrating actor comedy and dramatic. At nearly 60 years old, Mafioso’s themes still resonate today. In the preliminary part of the film, the social and cultural distinctions between North (Milan) and South (Sicily) are effectively represented. From the outfits to the dialogues, everything is masterfully done. In the 2nd part, a tonal change unleashes anguish in Sordi’s character, haunted by the ghost of a life of crime. In Mafioso, the mafia puts an individual into the trap of an evil system.\n\nSalvatore Giuliano (1962)\n\nSalvatore Giuliano is a 1962 mafia movie by Francesco Rosi. The film examines the circumstances that led to the death of the Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano, discovered in Castelvetrano in the early morning of July 5, 1950. The film was chosen among the 100 Italian films to be preserved. 1950: the body of the infamous outlaw Salvatore Giuliano is discovered in Castelvetrano. A long flashback begins in which the very first post-war years in Sicily are retraced, the birth of the request for independence of Sicily and the first “exploits” of Giuliano, his cousin Gaspare Pisciotta and their criminal gang. Montelepre, Giuliano’s birthplace, is protected by the Carabinieri’s anti-banditry units in an attempt to capture him and Pisciotta. The outlaws strike once again: in 1947 the massacre of Portella della Ginestra takes place and then the narration of the film returns to the discovery of the body of Salvatore Giuliano. Pisciotta was arrested, tried together with his cronies and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nWe Still Kill the Old Way (1967)\n\n“To Each His Own” is a 1967 Italian mafia movie directed by Elio Petri. The plot of the film takes place in a small town in southern Italy and follows the story of a middle-aged pharmacist, Arturo Manno, played by Gian Maria Volonté, who tries to solve the mysterious murder of three citizens of the town.\n\nThe first victim is a lawyer who opposed the construction of a new cemetery, the second is a farmer who had had an affair with the wife of a friend of Arturo’s, while the third is a young man belonging to a local mafia family. Arturo, obsessed with the case, investigates the three murders and tries to find the culprit.\n\nThe film deals with themes such as justice, corruption, friendship and revenge, and offers a social critique of the small southern Italian community. The film was appreciated for the direction of Elio Petri, for the photography by Luigi Kuveiller and for the performances of the actors, in particular by Gian Maria Volonté. “To each his own” won the prize for best film at the 1967 Berlin Film Festival and is considered a classic of Italian cinema.\n\nThe Day of the Owl (1968)\n\nThe Day of the Owl is a 1968 film directed by Damiano Damiani, with Franco Nero and Claudia Cardinale, based on the homonymous book by Leonardo Sciascia.

Carabinieri officer Bellodi, from Parma and former partisan, serving in a small town, investigates the murder of Salvatore Colasberna, killed for refusing to accept an agreement with a protected company of the mafia. The murder took place near your home where Rosa Nicolosi, her partner and their child live. Rosa Nicolosi’s husband also disappeared on the same morning. The head of the municipality, don Mariano Arena, organizes a maneuver to sidetrack the investigation into the Colasberna murder: in practice it would have been Nicolosi who eliminated the impresario as his wife’s lover. The captain searches for the body of Nicolosi, who he thinks has been disposed of as a “troublesome” witness.\n\nMachine Gun McCain (1969)\n\nIt is a 1969 Italian mafia movie directed by Giuliano Montaldo and starring a stellar cast that includes Gian Maria Volontè, Florinda Bolkan, Peter Boyle, Anthony Dawson and Mariangela Melato.\n\nThe plot of the film revolves around a team of corrupt cops who deal with the mafia drug racket in the city of Genoa. The leader of the gang is played by Gian Maria Volontè, who gives life to an extremely ambiguous and intriguing character, capable of going from being a successful man to a ruthless criminal in a few moments.\n\nThe story unfolds through a series of twists and dramatic situations, involving both the cops and the criminals trying to thwart them. The pace of the film is fast and engaging, thanks to the skilful direction of Montaldo and the photography of Silvano Ippoliti, who manages to perfectly capture the murky and oppressive atmosphere of the city of Genoa.\n\nThe film was a huge hit at the Italian box office upon its release, thanks to its gripping storyline and top-notch cast. The film was also appreciated by critics for its ability to investigate the dark side of Italian society in the 60s, through a ruthless analysis of the corruption and violence that characterized many cities in the country at that time.\n\nIt’s a film about the mafia that stands out for its ability to mix suspense, action and social denunciation, resulting in a complete and enthralling work.\n\nThe Sicilian Clan ( 1969)\n\nIt is a 1969 film directed by Henry Verneuil and starring Alain Delon, Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura. The film is mainly set in Paris and tells the story of a group of Sicilian criminals who plan the theft of a jewelry collection in an important Parisian jewelry store.\n\nThe main character is Roger Sartet, played by Alain Delon, a jewel thief who was caught by the police and detained in prison. However, the Sicilian mafia boss, Vittorio Manalese, played by Jean Gabin, has a plan to free Sartet from prison and use him for the theft of the jewels. To do this, Manalese also involves Commissioner Le Goff, played by Lino Ventura, who has an old rivalry with Sartet.\n\nThe plot of the film is full of twists and turns and action but the strong point of the film is the portrayal of the conflict between the old and new generation of criminals. Gabin plays an old-fashioned mafia boss with a sense of honor and a respect for tradition, while Delon is the ambitious young thief who wants to make it big in the world of crime.\n\nThe film is considered one of the best French mafia movies and offers a good representation of the Sicilian criminal underworld and its ties to the French mafia. The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone was also particularly appreciated and contributed to the success of the film.\n\nThe Mattei Affair (1972)\n\nThe Mattei case is a 1972 film directed by Francesco Rosi and inspired by the life of Enrico Mattei, a prominent Italian businessman who was president of ENI (Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi) until his mysterious death in 1962.\n\nThe film tells the story of Mattei, played by Gian Maria Volonté, from his rise to leadership of ENI until his death.

Rosi uses a complex narrative structure, alternating documentary sequences with moments of fiction, to reconstruct the life of Mattei and the complex dynamics of the oil world.\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed for its innovative direction and performance by Volonté, who won the Best Actor Award at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. The Mattei Case is considered one of Francesco Rosi’s best films.\n\nThe Godfather (1972)\n\nThe cinematic artwork of Francis Ford Coppola is an adaptation of Mario Puzo’s novel of the same name. Marlon Brando offers among his best performances as Don Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the mafia in Corleone.\n\nThis is the most popular mafia movie ever made. Any movie buff will recognize the image of Don Vito holding the feline or Michael closing the door to his former life. The Godfather incorporates some of the most significant minutes in cinematic history. Puzo and likewise the splendid screenplay of Coppola’s film are an ideal basis for an epic and important film production, of great figurative and pictorial value. It is a film where action and crime take a back seat to make way for a great family saga and the complex relational dynamics between mafia families.\n\nLucky Luciano (1973)\n\nLucky Luciano is a 1973 film directed by Francesco Rosi. The film focuses on the figure of Salvatore Lucania, known as “Lucky Luciano”, the gangster of the Italian-American mafia in New York who returned to Italy in 1946. The film is a sort of biography of Salvatore Lucania, alias Lucky Luciano, undisputed boss of the Italian-American underworld since 1931, when he took power getting rid of about forty opponents. In 1946 Governor Thomas E. Dewey sent him to Italy. Since that day Lucky has lived a relatively peaceful life in Naples, however there are new charges for international drug trafficking. Charles Siragusa, head of the European Narcotics Office, tries in vain to unmask him. In a dispute at the United Nations, Inquisitor Harry J. Anslinger and the Italian delegate clash over Luciano. Prompted by world popular opinion, the Guardia di Finanza subjects Lucky to tailings, interrogations and searches. No one discovers a single piece of evidence against him. Lucky Luciano dies of cardiac arrest at the Naples airport, taking the mystery to his grave.\n\nMean Streets (1973)\n\nThe third film directed by Martin Scorsese Mean Streets is among the most important in his filmography. Scorsese said he was attracted to the idea of ​​making a film about him and his friends. He even challenged De Niro’s character Johnny Boy, the film’s reckless lunatic. The film takes place in the location of Little Italy, New York, in addition to telling the experiences of Scorsese, there is the mafia, the corruption of the cops, crime. The packaging is still the same from indie movie low budget, shot in 16mm: this makes this mafia movie even more realistic and fascinating.\n\nThe Godfather Part II (1974)\n\nAnother one cinematic artwork, with Michael Corleone played by Pacino. Memorable tunes swell and catastrophe from both Godfather movies sweeps you over like a storm. Quite possibly no character displays the phrase “power wears out” more than Michael Corleone. Through 2 films, we see how his growth as a mobster is directly related to his family lineage. Both films are works of art, however The Godfather II takes the very first position for its extraordinary depiction of the world of the mafia.\n\nYakuza (1974)\n\nThe 1974 film “Yakuza” is a Japanese mafia movie directed by Sydney Pollack, starring Robert Mitchum and Ken Takakura.\n\nThe plot revolves around Harry Kilmer (Mitchum), a former American soldier who is called back to Japan by his childhood friend George Tanner (Brian Keith), who owns a company that has business dealings with the yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Tanner asks Harry to help him free his kidnapped daughter from the yakuza and, despite initially reluctant, Harry agrees.\n\nIn an attempt to save the girl, Harry must confront members of the yakuza and their leader, Tanaka Ken (Takakura), who had been one of George Tanner’s best friends. Harry’s history with Tanaka Ken and his romance with Ken’s sister Eiko (Keiko Kishi) also emerge throughout the film.\n\nThe film is known for its attention to detail in its depiction of Japanese culture and yakuza, as well as the performances of Mitchum and Takakura, who have been praised for their ability to explore the complexity of their characters. The soundtrack was composed by Dave Grusin and the main theme, “Harlem Nocturne”, was performed by Takakura himself.\n\n“Yakuza” is an immersive and intense film that mixes elements of crime, drama and psychological thriller, and is considered a classic of the genre.\n\nThe Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)\n\nIt is a 1976 mafia movie directed by John Cassavetes. The plot follows a nightclub owner named Cosmo Vitelli (played by Ben Gazzara), an ambitious businessman who tries to keep his place afloat despite financial problems.\n\nCosmo’s situation worsens when he gets involved with gangsters who force him to pay off a $23,000 gambling debt. To pay off the debt, Cosmo agrees to kill a man on behalf of the gangsters, but the plan goes awry and Cosmo is seriously injured.\n\nThe film was praised for its realistic take on the underworld, its somber cinematography, and the performance of Ben Gazzara, who received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal of the character Cosmo. However, the film was not a huge box office success, but has been re-evaluated over the years as one of the masterpieces of the independent cinema American 70s.\n\nIn 1978, Cassavetes directed a second version of the film, which was shortened by approximately 20 minutes and received positive response from audiences and critics. This version is often considered the better of the two, although both are prized for their emotional strength and for their ability to depict the complexity of human nature.\n\nCorleone (1978)\n\nThe 1978 film “Corleone”, directed by Pasquale Squitieri, is a mafia drama that chronicles the life of notorious mafia boss Salvatore Giuliano, played by Giuliano Gemma.\n\nThe plot focuses on the life of Giuliano, from his childhood until his mysterious death in 1950. The film follows the young Salvatore as he joins the group of local bandits, becomes a hero of the fight against the powerful and ends up becoming a mafia boss with full rights.\n\nThe character of Giuliano is represented as a man torn between his will to fight oppression and injustice and his desire to earn money and power. Its history is intertwined with that of post-war Sicily, a period marked by poverty, corruption and violence.\n\nThe film was widely criticized for its portrayal of Giuliano as a romantic hero rather than a ruthless criminal. However, the film was lauded for its performances, especially that of Gemma in the title role.\n\nOverall, “Corleone” is a film that explores the complexity of the Sicilian mafia and its roots in the island’s history and culture.
