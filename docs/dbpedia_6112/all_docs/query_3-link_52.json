        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAccording to some, \"The Godfather\" is the greatest film ever made, maybe they are right? It's a multi-generational crime family saga. The story is set in New York City between 1945 and 1955. The Corleone family is a very powerful force in the city. Don Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando, is a mafia boss. The story follows his son Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, and his rise to power; from a reluctant family outsider to a ruthless boss. Like the old saying, keeping it in the family, Michael brings control and stability to the family and the business, but also destruction of his own values and a tragic end to the Corleone dynasty. \"The Godfather\" is a very effective and interesting portrayal of interconnectedness of family and Mafia. It shows how the Mafia generally has a more educated and effective strategy to gain power on American capitalists, and often it will be using them, or \"bargaining with them\" (i.e. Woltz and the horse). In today's world of multiple and non-stop channels of entertainment, the feature film industry still remains to be a very active and exciting medium. With an industry that's so rich in art, filmmaking, and a plethora of genres, it's tough to imagine a single person who hasn't seen or heard about a certain motion picture. Of these types of genres, perhaps one of the most controversial, yet ever so intriguing is the crime and gangster genre. Plan and simple, the genre has a set plot, with certain scenarios which can be thoroughly explained in just this one paper. These themes that will be covered thoroughly are the rise and fall of a criminal, which occurs by a pattern of repeating events, the two-faced aspect of a crime lord, and the much too often occurrence of hypocritical betrayal.\n\n1.1. Definition of Crime and Gangster Movies\n\nThis chapter will give information and investigation of crime and gangster films, and will focus on the development and usage of the genre within cinematography. The criminal genre is deeply embedded in American culture with icons like the gangster, the Mafia, and the detective. This genre is an exciting realm of the spectacle of the underworld. Primarily, the study of the portrayal of crime in cinema is the analysis of their retelling of contemporary history. It is an exploration of the murky and forbidding reality of life. It is partly the realistic reflection of life and partly an extrapolation of its expression of hopes and fears and the revelation of the meanings of crime and punishment to the human condition. Crime/criminal/gangster films are the flip-side of the success/greatness film genre. They focus on the lives of criminals. The specifically acknowledges the villainy, activities, who have a desire to seize power, justice, with the added tension of methods. This can be a great film in new film venues such as the Tarantino version. A significant development in this genre is the formulation of the heist film, where a group of criminals plan and execute a major crime, usually to reap the reward of the great wealth. This is a testing of a still somewhat heroic villain against the system. This is an undeniable entertainment genre, the action and adventure, and a chance for the criminals to represent alternative heroic models. Many films have been identified as the crime/gangster genre, and the audience and film scholars are still debating which films belong in this category and why.\n\n1.2. Historical Background\n\nThe Hollywood crime and gangster movie has undergone significant development in the way it has portrayed gangsters and criminals. The film industry of the 1930s and 40s and the modern day period have considerably differing views on what may be considered a gangster and what a crime. The gangster movie is still a prevalent genre in the industry today, and it has really taken off as a favourite topic for the public. It is said that this is because it offers a glance into worlds that are things most people do not have any knowledge of, and will never be a part of. It also glamorizes the life of crime, and this is still a popular topic in today's consumer culture. But changes in the views of the life of a criminal and the cops and lawmen who try to stop them can still be traced back to the earliest of these films. During the Great Depression, there was a new demand to escape the reality of the time, and the escapism offered by the gangster film was one which gave the public a fantasy of success and wealth, something that was out of their reach. It also offered a new kind of hero, one of whom started from the very bottom of society and succeeded to reach the top against all odds. Although the manner in which gangsters were portrayed is not very realistic to the actual events and people, it gave an alternative to the stereotype of the immigrant, in which many were still looked down upon. It was also a time in which the public opinion of law enforcement was very low, and films that featured a more sympathetic criminal character often even portrayed the gangster as a modern-day Robin Hood. A prime example of this can be seen in William Keighley's 'G-Men' in 1935, in which the film is based upon a group of FBI agents determined to bring down notorious gangster 'Machine Gun' Kelly, was actually shot as a response to John Dillinger's recent string of bank robberies. This film offered new hope for a cleanup of the streets and by the end of the 30s, the Motion Picture Association of America no longer allowed the portrayal of criminals as heroes.\n\n1.3. Importance of Crime and Gangster Movies\n\nEssay on crime and gangster movies are essential in use of popular film for society. The main reason is because popular film is considered to have the power of mass communication. It is still widely believed, though not necessarily proven, that films in general have a large capacity to influence greater society. If this is accepted as true, then popular film as the most prevalent form of film must have a large capacity to influence greater society. If crime and gangster films are a large aspect of popular film, then they must also have a great capacity to influence society, but in what way? This is the central point of discussion for the importance of crime and gangster movies. The importance of crime and gangster movies can have varying degrees of impact on society. It is easy to assume that violent crime films can have a negative impact on society because it can be seen to glorify criminal activities. An example of this would be \"The Godfather\", where the Corleone family is in organised crime. The character Michael Corleone is portrayed as a likeable person when he becomes involved in his family's criminal activity as a mean to protect his father. Viewers of this film who are first or second generation immigrants of a country with strong racial prejudice would empathise with the storyline as they held similar issues in attaining social mobility for their family. Such viewers would take pride in seeing an Italian American from the Corleone family rise to a position of wealth and power, who is still widely considered the epitome of the American dream. From this we see that the importance of crime and gangster movies is not their influence on society but more so their reflection of society. \"The Godfather\" was a period film set in the 1940s, a time where immigration to America was strong and there were jobs to be had, but Italian Americans and other immigrants faced strong racial prejudice and were unable to attain social mobility. These immigrants found their only means of stable employment in the African American community or through crime. The character of Michael Corleone reflects an immigrant in similar conditions seeing a means to have a better life for his family and attaining higher social status. The job that Michael does in the film is protect his father and the family, reflecting the aforementioned immigrants who held similar jobs to attain social mobility for their family. \"High and Low\" is a Japanese crime film by Akira Kurosawa which reflects similar issues, the character Kingo Gondo is an executive for shoewear company who has taken first step on road to success. When shoe company's chauffeur's son is mistakenly abducted instead of Gondo's son, it is revealed that Gondo has bought the company from the current president and a group of share holders using money provided by his wife's family and is now in debt. Gondo's hard work to attain executive status has been to no avail and he sees buying the company as the high and low point of his life. This reflects postwar Japan and its economic situation, where many people who saw hard work as means to attain a better life had been a failure and similar to the immigrants in The Godfather were only able to provide a better life for their family through crime. Crime and gangster films can still be seen a today's society with the wealth of hip hop culture and its portrayal of street life and ghetto fabulous lifestyle. It is not merely the violence of crime films but also the reflection of these issues throughout various periods in history that have an importance.\n\n2. Themes and Motifs in Crime and Gangster Movies\n\nWith each and every crime, and every prohibited act depicted, directors embody varied utilitarian purposes and meanings behind their representation. The examination of the system of crime and justice and its effect on the individual or society is the theme of many film and television projects. In the film industry, crime and law have been a constant theme. The shows that involve cops as well as robbers are numerous; a typical feature of this genre. The interaction between law and deviance is the real meat to this theme. Representations of criminal activity by the law can be found in various genres throughout film history. But it's the crime and gangster genre that has focused entirely upon criminals and their activities, with the majority of such productions siding with the criminal rather than law enforcement. Often it is the protagonist who is a criminal of some kind, and the law enforcement agents are represented as an evil force. This would suggest that crime in these films is often associated with an anti-hero theme. An example of this comes in the modern classic Scarface (1983), a film based on the rise and fall of a drug dealer, which suggested that the policing of the war on drugs was worse a crime than the drug dealing itself, and the private activities of the agent; much of it violent, showed no real justice or a positive result. Prerequisites to cause and prohibition is punishment. Often some form of punishment is the catalyst to a criminal act, thus the criminal act itself is a reaction to an injustice in the opinion of the offender, and at times it is an act for the sake of changing a law or policy deemed unjust. But what of the criminal that acknowledges his guilt, one that does not attempt to rationalize his behaviour as an act for justice, and accepts that he must now pay for what he has done. This is where the theme of the 'situation of justice' on an individual is often portrayed by a criminal with a 'higher honour' i.e. a yakuza boss, American mobster of the 1920's and 30's or a mafia don. The belief and the judgement of his peers and an understanding on whether or not he is deserving of what has been decreed. Usually this character will be the protagonist, and the story is a tale of how he came to his current situation. The best example of this would be the Japanese film (仁, Jin) in its two-part series released in 1994, telling the tale of a former doctor and homeless wanderer who becomes the boss of the yakuza during the post-World War 2 period, who then contracts a terminal illness and attempts to secure his clan's future before dying an honorable death. It is a contrast to the many portrayals of crime and justice with a recent Scorsese film, The Irishman, which suggests that regardless of loyalty or honor, crime is always a lose/lose gamble on the entire self.\n\n2.1. Crime and Justice\n\nCrime is considered to be a fundamental aspect within the thriller genre and the gangster movie. It is also steeped in morality and questions the righteousness of particular actions. In discussing crime in relation to the genre of gangster movies, Paul Monaco has suggested that they \"lead us to the dark territories of human nature, a voyage into crime, cruelty, violence, and cunning\" (Monaco, 1981). This statement is very true of the genre, and the crime committed by those depicted in gangster movies is never shown to be victimless. The criminals portrayed almost always take advantage of others and create more problems for themselves through greed, betrayal, and violence. The law enforcement officers within these films usually serve little more than a facet for the greater criminals to show their prowess and influence and more often than not are being controlled or manipulated in some way. The crime and criminal acts depicted are generally easy to comprehend. These movies frequently revolve around a specific act or event, which serves as the catalyst for the chain of events leading to the ultimate downfall of the protagonist or main character. This particular event often involves betrayal of one party by another and is usually resolved with an act of revenge. Many gangster movies are rooted with inspiration from famous classical literature, and one only needs to look at plays such as Macbeth or Othello to see how aspects of crime, cruelty, betrayal, and retribution are effective tools for dramatic storytelling.\n\n2.2. Power and Corruption\n\nPower is a complex theme about control. It is valued and misused. It often changes the personality and character of a person, usually for the worse. The idea of power corrupting is strongly conveyed in the genre of crime and gangster movies, with many examples provided. Power is seen as the main goal for any character in a crime or gangster movie. In American Gangster (dir. Ridley Scott, 2007), Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) grows up in Harlem, New York City, where he seeks to become the most powerful drug dealer in the city. This happens during a time of growing influence of the Mafia. To achieve his goal, Lucas builds his empire by smuggling heroin into the city using American service planes that have returned from Vietnam. Lucas' power and influence grow rapidly, and he takes on the cops and the mob bosses to take a stranglehold on the city's drug supply. This leads to a life of luxury for him and his family, all under the pretense of being a hardworking and successful businessman, with no one suspecting a thing. Lucas becomes so powerful that he almost seems untouchable. In the end, he is arrested and his empire is dismantled. However, in his eyes, it was the corruption from within the police force that led to his downfall. He was never convicted for the original charges and led a very comfortable life after his release. A parallel can be drawn between Lucas' character and the real-life person he was portraying. It is interesting to see that power and influence did indeed lead to corruption in the police force during the investigation of his crimes. This resulted in a paltry 5-year sentence for which Lucas served just 3 years. The overall message in this case was that corruption was rife and that Lucas' power had disrupted a sense of justice in the world he lived in.\n\n2.3. Loyalty and Betrayal\n\nA popular theme in many crime and gangster movies is that of loyalty and betrayal. This theme is especially popular in the mob genre and has been the basis for a number of mob films. Loyalty is represented by the \"old school\" mobsters who follow the traditional values of the \"family\" and \"honor\" and realize that these values do not hold a place in the modern mob. They often find themselves betrayed by the younger, more corrupt gangsters who are only out for themselves. This is the case with Don Vito when he is shot by Barzini and Sollozzo in The Godfather. Vito was a man of principle and honor. He did not believe in getting involved in the drug trade despite the massive profits because he saw it as damaging to his people. He was then betrayed by men he had tried to cooperate with, who saw him as an obstacle and decided to eliminate him. Similarly, Vito Corleone, Tom Hagen, and others with ethics and morality in the mob genre are victims of betrayal as they are often sold out by their peers who see them as a hindrance. Essentially, the betrayal of the old school by the new school in these movies symbolized an end of an era for the mob - the end of traditional values and honor, replaced by a new era of dishonorable and disloyal criminals. This was also shown in The Godfather. After the death of Sonny, the reins of the Corleone family are briefly taken over by Michael, who transitions the family to a more modern style of mob that breaks away from the values of his father. Any act of betrayal is often met with fierce revenge from those who were wronged. Thus, betrayal is often a catalyst for many events in these movies. An example of this is Payback, a film based around several different betrayals between friends over money. Each betrayal leads to a retaliation and often a counter betrayal.\n\n2.4. Violence and Redemption\n\nThis study will use \"The Godfather\" trilogy directed by Francis Ford Coppola (1972, 1974, 1990) and \"Scarface\" directed by Brian de Palma (1932, 1983) to illustrate the use of violence in these movies. It will argue that the depiction of violence as a means to redemption is a major concern in this genre. This essay will also explore the common suggestion that these films endorse the thesis that unlawful acts of violence can be justified in response to moral injustice, and that the application of a legal system not susceptible to corruption is virtually impossible. Redemption is a theme that has long existed in literature and film. It involves the concept of being saved from evil and sin, or basically the idea of being able to right a wrong in one's life. In \"The Godfather,\" Michael Corleone seeks redemption from his life of crime. He had initially been the only son not wanting to partake in the family business, seeking to become a senator and distancing himself from the family's ways. Upon the assassination attempt on his father's life, he seeks vengeance for the murder of his father and a corrupt police captain who was paid to prevent justice and enable his recovery. In doing so, he commits to the very crime he sought to escape. This leads to the death of his wife and the realization that all is lost and he is damned. His redemption comes too late. But in a final act, he seeks to save his sister's son from the life they had all lived, knowing he will likely not see him again. \"Scarface\" depicts the rise and fall of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant recently freed from a Cuban prison, based in the 80s in Miami. His goal was to obtain power and money; a wad of 500 dollar bills being his longtime symbol of success; and he too sought to distance himself from his criminal lifestyle. His first steps of violence were consumed by his greed and lust for his boss's woman and money. In betrayal to his boss in a deal to assassinate a political target, he sought and justified his actions by the greed and corruption of those above him. This path led to his eventual rise to power, which was built on nothing other than crime and corruption. His final act was one of redemption as he sought to protect his sister from Colombian drug lords and in doing so, he realized he could save himself from damnation. But this act cost him his life, and he fell victim to an inevitable destiny, i.e., \"The world is yours chico, and everything in it.\"\n\n3. Impact and Influence of Crime and Gangster Movies\n\nIt is arguable that no other type of film has had the same impact on popular culture as the crime and gangster genre. This can be seen in a variety of items and areas. For example, the fashion of 1930s gangster films has made a huge comeback with modern teenagers and adults trying to copy the underworld style. \"Zoot suits\" with broad-brimmed hats, high-waisted, wide-legged trousers, and long coat jackets along with the style of shoes with pointed toes and an extended heel are now the highly recognized fashion of today, thanks to their association with characters such as Al Capone and Baby Face Nelson. Along with the revival of 1930s fashion, the end of Prohibition in 1933 provided gangster films with much historic background that was ideal for adaptation. This history is no doubt still imprinted in the minds of people and has been documented and studied over the years, thus providing producers with an abundance of material and stories on the crime era. Another point is that in the 1930s, the period of the films, it is highly interesting. The US was going through the Great Depression, which hit the urban poor hard. Al Capone had built up a large public following among this group by offering food and drink at discounts and even sponsoring a daily milk fund for the poor in 1932. The symbolism of someone who fought against authority and gave to the poor is quite romantic and this has led to a belief by the poor and lower middle class that today's system works against them, giving them a better understanding of the era and the support for the genre.\n\n3.1. Cultural Significance\n\nA film's cultural significance can often be measured by its portrayal of the American dream, the effectiveness of its characters, dialogues, images, and plot in reflecting and shaping public attitudes and beliefs about issues such as success, power, violence, and justice. It is beyond doubt that crime and gangster movies such as Little Caesar, Public Enemy, and Scarface were highly effective in their portrayal of the American dream. What they showed, however, was a side of the dream that was not readily available to all. This was a dog eat dog world where the fastest and strongest won. Little Caesar's glorification of gangster life as a lucrative alternative to menial jobs and honest labor showed that crime was a means to a better way of life. The masses of poor during the depression years could identify with the gangster's rise to glory from the streets to become somebody in a society where somebody was better than anybody. The fast cutting and pacy rags to riches progression of the film would demonstrate to the audience that crime was a viable option for success. The gangster's despairing cry near the end of the film \"My name is Public Enemy Number One\" epitomized the failure of Prohibition and the social reformers' dreams of just legislation. The film's focus on the futility of trying to attain the American dream from a poor start and its successful portrayal of the gangster as a bad man but a man in bad times made it one of the best representations of a crime of survival that the poor identified with. The final scene's plea to end the depression and the mixed connotations of the last two lines \"I'll be out again\" and \"it's tough on the outside\" beautifully encapsulated the audience's hopes for an end to hard times and a quick end to the film's eerie prophecy of World War Two.\n\n3.2. Popularity and Box Office Success\n\nNot surprisingly, the genre of crime and gangster movies has proven to be a popular one with both general audiences and Hollywood filmmakers. Throughout the years, this genre has gone through the expected periods of highs and lows in popularity, experiencing a significant surge at the end of the 1920s (coincidentally with the end of the prohibition era) and again in the 1930s and 1940s. American society had always been fascinated with the lifestyles of these rebellious and violent, yet often charismatic, individuals who skirted the edges of the law. The economic and social turmoil of these particular decades made the general public more receptive to a look into the darker aspects of the American dream. The next significant peak in the popularity of crime and gangster films did not occur until the 1970s, as the societal disillusionment of that time provided a perfect backdrop for a critical look at an American society which seemed to have failed many of its citizens. The most recent surge in the popularity of these films began in the early 1990s and still continues strong today. This last period of popularity can be attributed to a number of factors. First and foremost, the increasing competition and glamour of the fight to control the drug trade has provided an abundance of filmable material. Also, the increasingly lax censorship laws regarding violence and adult material have worked to allow filmmakers freedom in their portrayal of historical and contemporary crime stories. Finally, the anti-hero has always been a popular subject with American audiences, and the crime and gangster genre provides a vehicle for some very complex character studies of individuals who often possess a strong sense of personal honor and loyalty. An example of the complexity of these characters can be seen in The Sopranos television series, which though not a film, has had a significant impact on the popularity of the genre in the past decade. A study of the popularity of any film genre would of course be incomplete without an examination of the financial success of these films. Crime and gangster movies have fared rather well at the box office, whether it be in the US or overseas, and several movies of this genre have gone on to become some of the top grossing films of their respective years. The financial success of these films can be attributed to the tough, no-nonsense attitudes of the characters they portray and the wide appeal of rags-to-riches stories of individuals who succeed against insurmountable odds.\n\n3.3. Influence on Other Film Genres\n\nThe influence that crime and gangster movies have had on other film genres is remarkable. Some films have been so deeply influenced by the crime genre that they completely reinvent the crime formula and create a new genre, for example the classic film-noir period in the late 40's. The most obvious example of this is in the film noir genre. Nix describes film noir as being \"really a form of neo realism; being the truthful reproduction of the way the American underworld conducts itself and how it appears to the law enforcement agencies, in this case a pair of tough private eyes.\" It is clear from this description that film noir is but an adaptation of the typical gangster film to a more shadowy, morally ambiguous world. This influence is not confined to any particular era and can be seen in recent years with the release of LA Confidential (1997). This film, adapted from James Ellroy's widely successful novel of the same name, is a fairly typical example corruption and malevolence spread by wealth, but the setting and noir-esque narration automatically categorize it as a neo noir. Although not directly inspired by a particular film, the depth and detail that has gone into the accurate representation of 50's era Los Angeles is down to the detailed historical work utilized in many gangster films."
