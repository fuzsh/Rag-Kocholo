        "text": "For my architecture thesis class last semester, I researched crime noir and gangster films. These two types of films are my two top favorites of all time. The purpose of the research was to dive into the history of the femme fatale. The femme fatale is the character who I am designing a residence for this semester; I wrote a previous blog about the Vamp Residence, which is the home which the femme fatale, Bridget Gregory, will live in.\n\nBefore I compare and contrast crime noir and gangster films, I will define each type of film.\n\nCrime noir films (aka film noir) are:\n\n“Both literary and cinematic noir are defined by: the subjective point of view, the shifting roles of the protagonist, the ill-fated relationship between the protagonist and society (generating the themes of alienation and entrapment), and the ways in which noir functions as a socio-political critique” http://www.crimeculture.com/Contents/Film%20Noir.html\n\nSome elements of crime noir are: dark alleys, femme fatales (the quintessential character), and twisting plots that end in major and minor tragedies, manipulation of shadows and dark brooding atmosphere, and stories of the underground criminal mind.\n\nCrime noir films are best known for being made in the 1940s and 1950s. After 1960s, crime noir films were regarded as “neo-noir”.\n\nExamples of crime noir films: Sunset Blvd, Third Man, Double Indemnity, Notorious, The Maltese Falcon, The Killing, Strangers on a Train, Touch of Evil, The Night of the Hunter, Laura, Out of the Past, The Wrong Man, In a Lonely Place, Key Largo, The Asphalt Jungle, Angels with Dirty Faces, The Big Heat, Ace in the Hole, I Confess, Dark Passage, Detour, Tomorrow is Another Day, Act of Violence, Odds Against Tomorrow, They Live By Night, Sweet Smell of Success, Moonrise, Nightmare Alley, Criss Cross and many more.\n\nTrailer to the Third Man (1949):\n\nTrailer to The Killing (1956):\n\nGangster films are:\n\n“Are developed around the sinister actions of criminals or gangsters, particularly bankrobbers, underworld figures, or ruthless hoodlums who operate outside the law, stealing and violently murdering their way through life”.\n\nGangster films are an extension of crime noir films; since the 1940s, gangster films have been put in their own genre. They have been around since 1915, but did not were put in a separate section.\n\nSome elements of gangster films: highlight of gangster’s life, glorification of the rise and fall of a gangster or gangsters, the stories of real-life gangsters, depiction of the secret life of criminals, and an inverted story of world of success and wealth.\n\nExamples of gangster films: The Musketeers of Pig Alley, The Regeneration, City Streets, Little Caesar, Scarface – The Shame of a Nation, G-Men, Papillion, Cool Hand Luke, The Shawshank Redemption, Machine Gun Kelly, Al Capone, The Untouchables, Bloody Mama, Point Blank, Bonnie and Clyde, On the Waterfront, The Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather Part I and II, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, Scarface, Carlito’s Way, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, The French Connection, Death Wish, Dirty Harry, True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, Fargo, A History of Violence, Infernal Affairs, The Departed, Hard Boiled, Public Enemies and many more.\n\nTrailer to Bonnie and Clyde (1967):\n\nTrailer to True Romance (1993):\n\nCrime Noir Films\n\nPositives: some of the most famous films are crime films, popular, gritty, uses light (or absence of light) as a strong element of characterization, use of shadows, the femme fatale, set in a time period (1940s and 1950s), black and white scenes, European and American genre.\n\nNegatives: set during a time period, black and white, lots of dialogue and elongated scenes, European and American genre.\n\nCrime noir films are not enjoyed by audiences world-wide. In my personal encounters with other people who enjoy films, many have not heard of the crime noir films listed above. People who lived around that time period were the ones who watched crime noir films. It is difficult to find a person around my age who has seen a crime noir film. Films today borrow from the crime noir genre such as Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1995) and his use of Uma Thurman as a femme fatale and Brian De Palma’s tribute to the 1940’s femme fatale and stylistic lighting in Femme Fatale (2002).\n\nGangster Films:\n\nPositives: some of the most famous films are gangster films, popular, gritty, violent, shows a style of life that majority of people do not live, earliest genre, still popular today, tells stories of real life criminals, world-wide genre, questions people’s morals and values.\n\nNegatives: makes a “hero” out of criminals, glorifies violence, extremely violent, over told stories.\n\nGangster films are the most widely watched films. People of all ages have enjoyed at least two gangster films. Many people who I have talked with have watched at least one of the films in the list above. Some of have watched five or more. One of the most popular gangster films is Scarface (1983) with Al Pacino as Tony Montana. It shows up on many top gangster film lists and is widely popular with my generation.\n\nMy Verdict:\n\nI love both types of films; each genre has many fantastic films. If I had to choose, I would choose crime noir as my all-time favorite genre. This is because of the gritty, morally testing plot, use of shadows and light, fantastic acting, socio-political critique, and the femme fatale. The femme fatale is the deal-breaker for me; she is the quintessential character who makes crime noir films special. Without her, crime noir is nothing."
