        "text": "Watch Prof Pauline Dixon discuss “The Economics of International Aid” at our 2016 THINK conference!\n\n—\n\nWhy do we have international aid? On balance is it beneficial or not? How could we make it more effective and what are the traps to avoid? Are there alternatives to aid that are actually more effective? If we want to help the poorest people in the world what should we do and what can we\n\ndo?\n\n—\n\nProfessor Pauline Dixon is a Professor of International Development and Education at Newcastle University in the north east of England. She lectures in economics, education policy and quantitative methods. Dixon’s research in India, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, China, and Tanzania investigates education for the poorest living in slums and shanty-towns. She has carried out research into education vouchers, reading programmes, peer teaching as well as investigated myths around the lack of gifted children living in slum areas and market oriented solutions to schooling and the alleviation of poverty. Dixon delivers keynote speeches and presentations around the world including at Capitol Hill, Washington D.C., USA, at Brown University, USA, as well as in Europe including Zurich, Liechtenstein, Durham, Glasgow, London, and Vienna. She has also presented the research findings to government officials in India and Africa. She won the South African Luminary Award for her dedication to alleviate poverty in developing countries. Her books include “International Development and Private Schools for the Poor” (2013) which was named as one of the 100 ‘books of the year’ by the Times Literary Supplement and her new edited Handbook with Humble “Handbook of International Development and Education” (2015).\n\n—\n\nThe IEA’s THINK conference THINK brings together some of the most prominent and thought-provoking economists from all over the world for a one-day conference targeted at those under 30.\n\nClick here to learn more about THINK: http://thinkiea.com/"
