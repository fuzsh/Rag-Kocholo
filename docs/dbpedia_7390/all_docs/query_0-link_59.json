        "text": "head of communications, 1. FC Union Berlin\n\nAfter 14 years in the cinema business Christian Arbeit joined his favourite football club 1. FC Union Berlin on a professional level in January 2009. He quickly developed a communications department that would fit the needs of a football club writing one of the most impressive success stories in Germany since then. The last 15 years have seen Union Berlin’s rise from a 3rd division club to a top flight club and Champions League participant of the 23/24 season. The club is not only a football club anymore but a multi channel entertainment asset with a huge following on various platforms.\n\nArbeit also set the sails for two remarkable media projects: Germany’s high profile football journalist Christoph Biermann was given the chance to join the men’s football team as a staff member for the club’s very first Bundesliga campaign in 2019/20, publishing his experiences in a book Germany’s football had never seen before.\n\nTwo years later German film maker and director Annekatrin Hendel joined the club for two and a half years to discover not the secrets of the sporting side of football but digging deep into the daily workloads of the people who run the club. The documentary made it to the big screes of German cinemas in spring 2024.\n\nAs the future is unwritten next already stories wait to be told soon.\n\nprospective parliamentary assistant BBB, European Union\n\nGerlof Bierma ran as candidate number 4 for the Dutch BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Citizen Movement), and – starting from July 16 – will likely be supporting the BBB delegation in the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nGerlof has a background in European law from Leiden University and began his career as a lawyer at Bird & Bird, followed by a position as a legal advisor for Rabobank, a major Dutch bank. He then transitioned to Germany, where he worked for Trade Republic. For nearly two years, he has been an independent legal consultant, assisting companies in obtaining financial licenses in the Netherlands, while also engaging in political activities. In the recent European elections, he ran as candidate number 4 for the BBB. Starting from July 16, he will likely be supporting the BBB delegation in the European Parliament from Brussels.\n\nfilm educationalist and museum pedagogue\n\nJulian Namé has many years of experience working as a film educationalist and as a museum pedagogue at the DFF – Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Co-founder of the film festival Africa Alive in 1994 and member of its team until 2006, he has been closely involved in a number of various distinct projects including the DFF – MultiMediaGuide, Our DFF – Creating New Spaces of Interaction, on the issue of social inclusion in museums, FilmWissenOnline, an online platform for film enthusiasts, and KiKi – Kinder, Kino und der BEP, focusing on cinema and early childhood education. He has also been leading a film club in Frankfurt continuously for almost thirty years.\n\nJulian has a doctorate in Sociology ad honorem from the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Institute of Sociology and the Humanities, in Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. From 1995 to 2003 he was also a visiting professor at both the University of the Americas, International Relations Dept., and at the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Institute of Sociology and the Humanities, in Puebla, Puebla, Mexico.\n\nstudent at Humboldt University, Berlin and DM alumnus\n\nHaving won the title of Best Individual in the Berlin Debating Matters Championship 2023, formerly representing Eckener Gymnasium, Lucca is judging for the first time. Lucca participated in DM Berlin in 2022 and 2023 and never lost a debate. He now studies Philosophy and English at Humboldt University in Berlin, and is soon to publish his first original printed work in the form of a philosophically charged, Miltonic Epic, which highlights how debating matters in narrative, just as it does in everyday life and most certainly for us today.\n\nprofessor emeritus for Philosophy at the Free University Berlin\n\nGunter Gebauer is the Professor emeritus for Philosophy at the Free University Berlin, a position he has held since 2012, joining the university as a professor in 1978 where he was a member of the interdisciplinary research groups “Performative Cultures” and “Languages of Emotion”. His main areas of research are historical anthropology, social philosophy and language theory.\n\nGunter has a PhD degree from the Technical University of Berlin (1969) and ‘Habilitation’ in Philosophy at the Technical University of Karlsruhe (1975).\n\nBook publications include:\n\nWie wird man ein Mensch? (2021).\n\nVom Sog der Masse und die neue Macht der Einzelnen (2019, with S. Ruecker).\n\nWittgenstein’s Anthropological Philosophy (2017).\n\nVon der Emotion zur Sprache. Wie wir lernen, über Emotionen zu sprechen (2017, with M. Holodynski, S. Koelsch, Ch. von Scheve).\n\nDas Leben in 90 Minuten. Eine Philosophie des Fußballs (2016).\n\nMimetische Weltzugänge.

His experiences in the commercial and academic world have given him insights and experience with climate and energy policy, particularly in nuclear energy and UK housing realities.
