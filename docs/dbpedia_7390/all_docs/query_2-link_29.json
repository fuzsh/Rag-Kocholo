The analysis will be used to inform the UK’s Fourth Independent Assessment of Climate Risk (CCRA4-IA). For more information and to apply - https://lnkd.in/eE3-kqB\n\n!! Dr Xanthe Polaine !! Yesterday I successfully defended my PhD thesis and passed my Viva! It feels like a lot of life has happened from the start of this journey up until this point and I'm so happy to have got here. I'd like to thank my examiners Tom Curtis and Paul Jowitt. Also the biggest thanks to family, friends and colleagues who have supported me on this journey - especially my fantastic supervisors Jaime M. Amezaga and Richard Dawson FREng !!"
