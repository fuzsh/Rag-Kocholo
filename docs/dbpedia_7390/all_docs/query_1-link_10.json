Unless suppressed by the educational establishment, it will transform its subject.’\r– J.C.D. Clark, Times Literary Supplement (Named as one of the ‘Books of the Year’ by the Times Literary Supplement)\r\r‘This is a must-read book for anyone interested in the plight of poor children, particularly for those readers concerned with learning about culturally sensitive and proven ways to reach out and help less fortunate children in developing countries. I was fascinated and outraged by the compelling stories and actual data that Dixon shares in this gem of an exposé. Most readers will similarly be shaken and incensed by the failure of billions of dollars spent on state schooling in Africa and India. Dixon makes a compelling case for the value and contributions of low cost private schools in slums and low income areas in developing countries. After reading this book, I am now a believer!’\r– Steven I. Pfeiffer, Florida State University, US",
