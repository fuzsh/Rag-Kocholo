        "text": "School Choice around the World: ... and the Lessons We Can Learn by Pauline Dixon\n\nThis volume of essays examines the empirical evidence on school choice in different countries across Europe, North America, sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It demonstrates the advantages which choice offers in different institutional contexts, whether it be Free Schools in the UK, voucher systems in Sweden or private-proprietor schools for low-income families in Liberia. Everywhere experience suggests that parents are `active choosers': they make rational and considered decisions, drawing on available evidence and responding to incentives which vary from context to context. Government educators frequently downplay the importance of choice and try to constrain the options parents have. But they face increasing resistance: the evidence is that informed parents drive improvements in school quality. Where state education in some developing countries is particularly bad, private bottom-up provision is preferred even though it costs parents money which they can ill-afford. This book is both a collection of inspiring case studies and a call to action.\n\nPauline Dixon is Professor of International Development and Education at Newcastle University, where she obtained her doctorate. She has been carrying out research into schooling in developing countries for almost twenty years. Professor Dixon has undertaken research projects that include large-scale surveys and census mapping and the testing of children around the world in various subjects, including creativity and motivation. In Delhi her research has examined the teaching of English through phonics and assisting in the implementation, running and testing of an education voucher scheme. Her book International Aid and Private Schools for the Poor: Smiles, Miracles and Markets was named one of the top 100 books by the Times Literary Supplement. Professor Dixon received a Luminary Award from the Free Market Foundation of South Africa."
