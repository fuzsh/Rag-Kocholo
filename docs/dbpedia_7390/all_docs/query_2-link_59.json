        "text": "Project description\n\nEntrepreneurship educators are at the crossroads of several transformation processes in entrepreneurship education by translating the curriculum into practice based on their personal philosophical and conceptual understanding of the concept, and by determining the time, frequency, contents and methods of entrepreneurship education in their. Despite this critical role in the process of implementing entrepreneurship education in the classroom, much of the available research explores or describes entrepreneurship educators’ profile only marginally and literature on the educators’ perspective “remains relatively silent” (Neck & Corbett, 2018). This is especially the case for entrepreneurship educators situated in Higher Education because many of the authors most prolific in the field researched educators situated within the primary and secondary school context.\n\nWithin the small body of knowledge about entrepreneurship educators, several papers indicate that entrepreneurship educators lack the skills to deliver entrepreneurship education effectively in the classroom which has led to wide recognition of the significance of developing entrepreneurship educators’ skills. Identifying which professional development events current entrepreneurship educators have taken part in, which one worked (or not) for those already in the field, and how they impacted the educators’ competencies constitute a first step towards designing, revising and implementing a professional development program to address the knowledge gap. As Higher Education is under ever-increasing pressure to cut budgets and limit spending identifying what works or doesn’t from the entrepreneurship educators own perspective and experience can ensure that limited professional development budgets are spend in an impactful and prudent manner and devised professional development can take into account different learning needs resulting from a variety of career patters and resulting diverse personal resources.\n\nThis study aims to contribute to the theoretical discussion within entrepreneurship education by shedding a light on the underrepresented profile of e-educators and their perspective about competency development. The practical implication of the study is to generate insights about e-educators competency development that can support their effective skills development by exploring the events most impactful to their professional competency development."
