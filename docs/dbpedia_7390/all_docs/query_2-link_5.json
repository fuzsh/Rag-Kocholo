Her professional experience has been wide-ranging and varied, including research, teaching, training, programme and project management, policy analysis, partner coordination and advocacy with education institutions, Government, bilaterals (CIDA, SIDA), multi-laterals (UNHCR, UNICEF, UNGEI, European Union) and INGOs (Oxfam Novib, WUSC, British Council). Kathleen’s research interests centre around the sociology and political economy of education and learning within development and humanitarian contexts. Specific themes of interest include identities, inequalities, social exclusion, social cohesion, social mobility, citizenship, inter/intra community relations and institutional power.\n\nDavid is Professor of Ecosystems Engineering and performs applied and fundamental research in engineering, ecology, molecular microbiology, and public health. After eight years in industry, David obtained his PhD in Environmental Engineering from the University of Arizona. Graham was a professor at the University of Kansas for 12 years where he studied relationships between agrochemical use, and water, soil, and food quality, including the fate of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) bacteria and genes. He now works around the world on mitigating the spread infectious diseases, including projects in India, China, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Europe, and the Americas.\n\nSteve is known for his expertise in analysing data for large samples using advanced statistical techniques. His most recent book Quantitative Analysis of Questionnaires: Techniques to Explore Structures and Relationships. He has published over 30 peer reviewed articles and six books.

He was awarded an MBE in the Queen’s 2015 New Year’s Honours list for his contribution to education, and is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.\n\nMark directs the Centre for the Study of Governance and Society. His work takes place at the intersection of philosophy, politics, and economics focussing on the implications of ‘non-ideal’ theorising for the evaluation of alternative governance systems. This approach examines in comparative terms how well or badly different institutions perform in conditions of limited knowledge and when there is the potential for opportunistic conduct. Mark recently completed a John Templeton Foundation project looking at the ‘Ideal of Self Governance’, examining the legacy of Elinor and Vincent Ostrom’s work on the advantages that ‘self-governing’ and ‘polycentric’ forms of governance may have over centralised governance regimes. His module for the Future Learn platform explaining ideas and principles (available here).\n\nKaren is Professor of Gender and Media at Newcastle University. Her teaching and research are focused on issues of gender, media, politics, ageing and society. She has published numerous papers and books on these topics and her latest (edited) collection, the International Encyclopaedia of Gender, Media and Communication was published by Wiley Blackwell in 2020. She is currently working on several participatory projects including with care home residents and staff around life post-lockdown, with women who have experienced the menopause and women entrepreneurs in India.\n\nIn Country Collaborators\n\nIndus Information Initiatives, is a boutique firm in Delhi specialising in social science field research. Bala is a visiting researcher at Newcastle University. He has an MA in Economics and Education from Columbia University Teachers College, and an LLB from Delhi University Faculty of Law. His research interests include school choice, educational accountability, and rule of law where he employs imaginative investigation and intervention designs to inform policy through new knowledge. He secured a Templeton Freedom Award in 2012 for his work around grassroots education in Bihar. Bala also conceptualised and directed Niti Express, an innovative campaign to spread awareness on personal rights through nano tales that aired on radio in eight cities of India in 2016. He is widely quoted in the media on educational choice and property rights related issues.\n\nRenu has worked extensively on issues of socio-economic poverty linkages along with equity and access of services for the poor. She has primarily been involved in creation of sustainable partnerships amongst government agencies, donors, research institutions and NGOs at the national and international level. She has managed and provided inputs to numerous programmes of Government of India and multilateral and bilateral agencies including DFID, ADB, Water AID, AusAID, USAID and UNICEF.\n\nRenu Khosla holds a M. A. in Child Development and Ph.D. in Home Science – Community Resource Management & Extension from University of Delhi. She also holds Bachelor’s degree in Social Science in Child Development.\n\nResearch Associates\n\nMyra is an anthropologist, employed as a Research Associate. Her background is diverse with experience working with Native Americans on matters of repatriation; curating and researching human remains, including evidence of health and disease pathways; managing and increasing access to heritage assets, like open-air rock art; and identifying cultural variable that influence the take-up of new technologies.

Since joining the Environmental Engineering group at Newcastle University she has adapted her skills to use microbiology to address environmental issues that connect both human and environmental health. Her current research focus is the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for health protection, including in the surveillance of COVID-19.\n\nShalini research interests are around policy planning, implementation and governance.
