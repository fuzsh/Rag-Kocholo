        "text": "2018 Spring Lecture\n\nAaron Hogan\n\nApril 26, 2018\n\nAaron Hogan is a husband, a dad of three, and an educator who is committed to helping those around him be their best. Since he entered the classroom, he has been trying to reimagine education to serve students best. He currently serves as the Coordinator of English, Language Arts, and Reading in College Station ISD where he previously served as a campus administrator and high school English teacher. Aaron is an author, blogger and speaker.\n\nHis book, Shattering the Perfect Teacher Myth: 6 Truths Will Help You THRIVE as an Educator, highlights his passion for social emotional learning, innovation in education, and connecting educators for professional growth. Toward that end, Aaron created two weekly Twitter chats (#CSISDchat, a chat that focuses on issues important to his school district, and #TeacherMyth chat, a chat that weekly seeks to shatter the myths that are present in education and highlight the truths that will help teachers thrive in their work). Both exist to connect, encourage, and challenge educators who are tackling the hard work that our profession demands.\n\n2017 Spring Lecture\n\nAshley Rhodes-Courter\n\nApril 13, 2017\n\nAshley Rhodes-Courter spent nine years in foster care. She recounted the horrors she suffered — and opened the eyes of many to a broken system — in her 2008 New York Times best selling memoir Three Little Words.\n\nDespite her ordeal, which lasted from ages 3-12, she excelled in school because she believed that “my education was the one thing nobody could take from me.” She earned Eckerd College’s full-tuition Trustee Scholarship, graduating with honors and ahead of schedule with a double major in communications and theatre before going on to complete her M.S.W. at the University of Southern California. As an undergraduate, she was selected as one of 20 students in the nation for USA Today’s All-USA Academic team and was named one of Glamour’s “Top Ten College Women,” in part due to her advocacy for children in abusive foster homes. Rhodes-Courter has appeared on Today, Good Morning America, Nightline, Nancy Grace and The Montel Williams Show, among other national media outlets. In 2009, she hosted the State of Florida-produced TV program Explore Adoption, which won an Emmy. In addition to her efforts domestically, Rhodes-Courter has spent time studying and advocating in Europe, South Africa and China. In her local community, she has served as a volunteer guardian ad litem and as a foster parent, caring for more than 25 children. Her eldest son was adopted from foster care. She chronicled many of these efforts in her second book, Three More Words, which debuted as a No. 1 bestseller in 2016.\n\n2015 Fall Lecture\n\nDr. Juli Dixon and Alex Dixon\n\nOctober 13,2015\n\nThe 28th year of the Riall Lecture Series kicks off with an inspiring presentation by a mother- daughter team. Juli Dixon, PhD, is noted professor of math education at the University of Central Florida. Her daughter, Alex, is a high school student in Orlando. When she was undergoing brain surgery at age 12, Alex suffered of a debilitating stroke that left her partially paralyzed and with severe speech impairment. The story of Alex's remarkable progress is chronicled in a presentation by both mother and daughter, featuring actual videos at several stages of her recovery. Their message of hope, perseverance, determination and patience has relevance for teachers at all levels. The Riall Lecture is free and open to the public. The Dixons will be available to sign copies of the book written by Juli and Alex's sister Jessica, A Stroke of Luck: A Girl's Second Chance at Life, following the lecture.\n\n2015 Spring Lecture\n\nRafe Esquith\n\nMarch 31,2015\n\nOnce-in-a-lifetime educator, Rafe Esquith may be the most inspiring school teacher in America. He's been called \"a modern day Thoreau\" by Newsday, \"a genius and a saint\" by The New York Times, and \"the most interesting and influential classroom teacher in the country\" by The Washington Post. For the past two decades, Esquith has taught fifth graders at a public school in a Los Angeles neighborhood plagued by guns, gangs, and violence. His exceptional classroom at Hobart Elementary - known simply as Room 56 - is unlike any other in the country.\n\nEsquith's student are mostly immigrants or children of immigrants, living in poverty and learning English as a second language. Yet under his tutelage, they voluntarily come to class at 6:30 in the morning and often stay until five in the afternoon. They learn math, reading, and science. But they also play Vivaldi, perform Shakespeare, often score in the top one percent on standardized tests, and go on to attend the best universities. For his near-heroic work, Esquith is the only teacher to be awarded the President's National Medal of the Arts. He has received the National Teacher of the Year Award and won accolades from Oprah, the Queen, and the Dalai Lama. He's also written four books, with his most recent being the critically acclaimed Real Talk for Real Teachers, published in 2013. His other books include Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire, There Are No Shortcuts, and Lighting Their Fires. Esquith has also been featured, along with his students, in the PBS documentary The Hobart Shakespeareans.\n\n2014 Fall Lecture\n\nFreeman A.

Under his guidance for the past 22 years, the university has become one of the nation’s leading undergraduate and research institutions, lauded by U.S. News & World Report and other publications.\n\nHrabowski has earned the Heinz Award for his contributions in improving the “human condition.” The Washington Post and Harvard University’s Kennedy School Center for Public Leadership have named him among the seven “Top American Leaders.”\n\nOther honors have included the U.S. Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, McGraw Prize in Education, General Electric’s African-American Forum ICON Lifetime Achievement Award, and honorary degrees from more than 20 institutions, including Harvard, Princeton and Duke Universities.

This year, he discusses “The Standards and Testing Juggernaut: Rescuing Education from ‘School Reform.’”\n\nKohn writes and speaks widely on human behavior, education and parenting.

Kohn has been featured on hundreds of TV and radio programs, including Today and The Oprah Winfrey Show. He has been profiled in the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, while his work has been described and debated in many other publications.\n\nHis articles on education include a dozen widely reprinted essays in Phi Delta Kappan from 1991-2008.
