        "text": "The E.G. West Centre is based in the School of Education, Communication, and Language Sciences, Newcastle University. The Centre was established in March 2002 and is dedicated to \"understanding the role of choice, competition and entrepreneurship\" in the delivery of \"Education for All\".[1] The centre is part of the Stockholm Network of market oriented think tanks. It is listed as forming part of the network in May 2010.[2]\n\nStockholm Network\n\nAs of May 2010 the E.G. West Centre is listed as being part of the Stockholm Network.[3] The Centre was also listed as a member in the Stockholm Network's accounts between 2005 and 2008.[4][5][6] James Stanfield of the EG West Centre describes their role within the Stockholm Network:\n\nYes I think we are still a member of the Stockholm Network, although as they don't focus much on educational issues, our input and involvement has been zero. We joined in about 2003 I think, just after the E.G. West Centre was set up to help increase our profile across Europe. We did start off by having an international advisory council of like minded scholars and academics from around the world, but they soon became redundant and so we know longer have one.
