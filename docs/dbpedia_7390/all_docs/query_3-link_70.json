        "text": "Dr Andrew Lindridge - Principal Investigator\n\nReader in Marketing, Newcastle Business School, Newcastle University, London.\n\n​\n\nAndrew’s research interests focus on the marginalised consumer, i.e. consumers who feel unable or unwilling to identify with the consumer market, or who the market intentionally excludes owing to cultural, economic, political, religious, or social reasons. An interest that has led to researching marginalised consumers in Britain, China, France, India, and the United States on a variety of consumption topics ranging from: ethnic minorities and alcoholism, inter-generational rifts within ethnic minorities, and how David Bowie fans use his music to reimagine their own past.\n\n​\n\nInstitution web page:\n\nhttps://www.ncl.ac.uk/london/staff/profile/andrewlindridge.html#background\n\nDr Anoop Bhogal-Nair\n\nSenior Lecturer in Marketing & Consumption, Leicester Castle Business School, De Montfort University.\n\n​\n\nAnoop's research interests center upon her interests in understanding how consumers negotiate and consume both their sense of physical being and their self-identity within the spaces they occupy. To date her work has focused upon Indian female consumers, religious minorities (Sikh disapora) and marginalised groups (disability). Much of Anoop's research takes an inter-disciplinary perspective - cultural studies, sociology, history and religion - focusing on the challenges, threats and opportunities consumers experience in their daily lives as individuals.\n\n​\n\nInstitution web page:\n\nhttps://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/business-and-law/anoop-bhogal-nair/anoop-bhogal-nair.aspx\n\nProfessor Pauline Dixon\n\nProfessor of International Development and Education\n\nSchool of Education, Communication and Language Sciences, Newcastle University.\n\n​\n\nPauline is the Co-Director of the Global Challenges Academy. She is Newcastle University's lead for the Global Challenges Summit. She has extensive experience working in Asia and Africa. Her major research interests are the theory of Austrian Economics, spontaneous order in economics, school choice, children's literacy, giftedness and creativity. She also is involved in research that considers interdisciplinary issues around informal settlements including health, gender, water, sanitation and nutrition.\n\n​\n\nInstitution web page:\n\nhttps://www.ncl.ac.uk/ecls/staff/profile/paulinedixon.html#background\n\n​\n\nDr Steve Humble MBE\n\nSenior Lecturer in International Development\n\nSchool of Education, Communication and Language Sciences, Newcastle University.\n\n​\n\nSteve carries out research in sub Saharan Africa and India. He is an expert around analysing data from large samples using advanced statistical techniques using both STATA and SPSS. One example would be the use of discrete choice models (McFadden, 1974) to directly test large household data sets to see whether the parents’ preferences and demographics affect the choice of attending different school management types. He was awarded an MBE for Services to Education in the 2016 New Year’s Honours List.\n\n​\n\nInstitution web page:\n\nhttps://www.ncl.ac.uk/ecls/staff/profile/stevehumble.html#background\n\nShobhana Sinha\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nDepartment of History, Bharati College, University of Delhi, New Delhi.\n\n​\n\nShobhana's research interests center upon community identity and religious movements with a specialization in medieval Indian history. Her work has featured in a number of academic journals and other publications.\n\n​\n\nInstitution website:\n\nhttps://www.bharaticollege.org/\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDr Rekha Sapra\n\nActing Principal\n\nBharati College, University of Delhi, New Delhi.\n\n​\n\nInstitution website:\n\nhttps://www.bharaticollege.org/"
