        "text": "From the 1968 A.A. ceremony:\n\nThis is a poignant and interesting clip, for many reasons. Steiger did not expect to win this award: he had been disappointed by his failure to win two years previously for his performance in The Pawnbroker (the nod went Lee Marvin instead for the little-remembered Cat Ballou). Steiger's win was for his performance as Sheriff Gillespie in In The Heat Of The Night. Sydney Poiter did not win for his performance in the same film and Steiger generously credits him for his collaboration. He even gets vaguely political - and is that a 'Black Power' salute he attempts at the end?\n\nSteiger wasn't to know it but this was the summit of his life: his career stalled shortly after the award, he didn't work for a year, then his marriage (to Claire Bloom) broke up and he spent the 70s in a tailspin of illness and alcohol dependence. Ten years later, it was all he could do to get a cough and a spit in B movies. Thankfully, things seemed to get before for him in his final years....\n\nI remember seeing him late in life in roles that seemed totally beneath him and wondering what the hell was going on.\n\nHe was really good in No Way To Treat a Lady\n\nReminds me of Gig Young--after his Academy Award, his career went totally into the tank and he wound up taking himself and wife out.\n\nYes: it needs to be said that the Academy Award might be as likely to end your career as enhance it. The idea that your price suddenly leap-frogs because you're an 'Oscar winer' doesn't automatically apply - your price might leap but that doesn't mean that anyone will want to employ you.\n\nI asked someone of my age if they'd heard of Steiger once. Their response: 'Is he the guy out of Mars Attacks?'\n\nSteiger was a brilliant actor who, like one of my other favs, Patrick McGoohan was badly used by Hollywood with not. Ucd being offered in the way of break out roles after his big win.\n\nIt's really odd because I remember Steiger quite well and still consider him one of the finest actors of his generation\n\nIt seems that Richard Burton often got the roles that Steiger deserved.\n\nI'm a little mystified as to how Burton remained a big star, despite a huge number of flops and films that were just plain bad.\n\nHis association with Elizabeth Taylor can't have counted for that much - can it?\n\nHe is terribly hammy in some of those performances, too (not necessarily his own fault - I blame a lot of poor screen performances on directors).\n\nAnytime I'm asked what my favourite film of all time is, I chose either In The Heat Of The Night or Five Easy Pieces. I know there are plenty of other better movies - objectively speaking - out there but, for some reason these two continue to resonate. Steiger is so brilliantly natural that you can't take your eyes of him and the chemistry between him and Potier is palpable.\n\nAnd the Blu-Ray is pretty stunning too ...\n\nI'll check out the Blu-Ray: the DVD (which I got cheap) is very ropey.\n\nThe famous scene in Gillespie's house is one of my favourite moments in all film: it's the point where you really start to pity Gillespie, who might as well be living alone on some distant pestilent planet. Tibbs might be on hostile territory but at least he's got a 'hinterland' in Philadelphia....\n\nSteiger was brilliant in The Loved One (1966).\n\nAnd so was Liberace (!)\n\nBurton was a very successful Shakespearean actor, really made big waves in the UK with interpretations that veered from the 'accepted' style of Gielgud, Olivier, and Richardson. He brought that gravitas to Camelot on Broadway. It didn't take him long to start taking any movie role that paid him well, and many them were real turkeys.\n\nI have a dvd of him doing Hamlet that is really intense.\n\nBurton was indeed a 'different' kind of Shakespearean actor in the 50s; to me, though, despite his great voice, his acting now looks rather stifled and declamatory. As stilted and declamatory as those of the generation before his. It's a fact of life that acting styles date very quickly, none more so than classical acting styles.\n\nI'm not aware of Steiger playing any Shakespearean roles, on either screen or stage. Marlon Brando famously played Mark Antony but his performance comes across as an Olivier imitation (to me, at least).\n\nBurton had 13 siblings and claimed that at one point he had 42 dependents\n\nIt wasn't until the '70s that decades of alcoholism began to really affect him. I recently watched The Wild Geese ('78). RB no longer moves gracefully, and in a few shots actually looks as if he may lose his balance.\n\nyea, but he went out on a high note in 1984 (didn't have to move of course)\n\nThis is a great oversimplification. Young got some leads in TV movies and was the father in Lovers and Other Strangers. In 1973 he seemed set to gain a new audience when he began Blazing Saddles as The Waco Kid. But Mel Brooks had no sympathy for his drinking problem and treated him like total sh!t -- at one point an ill Young allegedly crawled off the set, with no help from cast or crew.\n\nBrooks finally got Young fired and offered the role to Dan Dailey, who accepted and then declined the next day. Eventually it went to the wholly inappropriate Gene Wilder -- the role was meant to be played by an older actor, preferably an old time western star. It was offered to John Wayne, who turned it down but said he'd be the first in line to buy a ticket.\n\nI don't have anything against Steiger's performance in Zhivago per se, but I just sense a whole lot more New York in his role than a turn-of-the-century Russian -something I don't think was his fault.\n\nI think there were far too many non-Russian actors in that film as whole. That's one of my main criticisms against it -that, and the 1960s hairstyles and not filmed out in the real cold (how about January in Canada instead of Spain?).\n\nThat was part of Steiger's point -- that we tend to think of such roles being played by English actors, or at least Americans speaking Transatlantic.\n\nSomething that's always amused me is the British habit in such films of casting the lower-class roles with Cockneys (the cab driver in Gorky Park). Although with non-Oxford accents taking over the BBC this isn't as common as it once was -- the kid who played Augustus in Rome sounded like he'd just fallen off a fish lorry."
