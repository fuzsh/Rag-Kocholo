        "text": "Rod Steiger, whose taut and intensely personal approach to a wide variety of roles placed him among the finest character actors of the last 50 years and brought him an Academy Award in 1967 for his depiction of the bigoted Southern sheriff in the film ''In the Heat of the Night,'' died yesterday in Los Angeles. He was 77.\n\nHis publicity agent, Lori DeWaal, told The Associated Press that Mr. Steiger had been hospitalized with pneumonia and kidney failure.\n\n''My generation of actors was taught to be able to create different people,'' he once said. ''That's what an actor is supposed to do.''\n\nFor Mr. Steiger, those people arched across a spectrum from the lonely butcher in the original television production of ''Marty'' in 1953 and Charley Malloy, the corrupt older brother of the boxer played by Marlon Brando in the Academy Award-wining film version of ''On the Waterfront'' (1954), to the title role in ''Al Capone'' (1959), the menacing Jud in ''Oklahoma!'' (1955), in which he sang and learned to dance, and a haunted Jewish survivor of Hitler's concentration camps in ''The Pawnbroker'' (1965).\n\nMr. Steiger was W. C. Fields in ''W. C. Fields and Me'' in 1976, Mussolini in ''Lion of the Desert'' in 1981, and Napoleon in ''Waterloo'' in 1970. Among other historical figures in various films, he portrayed Rudolf Hess, Ulysses S. Grant, Rasputin and Pontius Pilate.\n\nHe worked with writers and directors like Norman Jewison, John Frankenheimer, Arthur Miller, Elia Kazan and Sidney Lumet, and his co-stars included a roster of names like Sidney Poitier, Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, Sylvester Stallone and Jack Nicholson.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
