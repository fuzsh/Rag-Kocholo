        "text": "(ran GB edition)\n\nRod Steiger basks in the afternoon light at his special table at Spago's a few doors north of Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nHis favorite spot is smack in the middle of the room, where Steiger likes to hold court, delaying the waiters as they come, prematurely, to take his order, and sipping water as he talks.\n\nDressed in a black-and-beige Hawaiian shirt, with his shaved head and a gold chain around his neck, Steiger enjoys the attention.\n\nHe's relished nearly a lifetime of it following such classic movies as On the Waterfront, In the Heat of the Night, The Pawnbroker, and his most recent, The Hurricane, End of Days, Crazy in Alabama.\n\nSitting across the table is actor Joan Benedict, his girlfriend of three years whom he met 30 years ago and with whom he reconnected after she was widowed.\n\n\"I got out of my depression about five years ago and got lucky,\" he says, choosing London broil from the menu.\n\n\"I'm going to be 75 in April and after all these years I have two cars. The license on one says \"Courage' and the other says \"Keep moving.' \"\n\nSteiger has kept moving ever since he tried to join the Navy at 16. He needed to locate his mother to have her sign the papers. \"This sounds like a story from Dostoevski,\" he says.\n\n\"I went downtown to a section of Newark called Little Neck.\n\n\"They have these terrible boarding houses, $2 a night. She's in this terrible room that's not very clean and the woman is out of her mind. I said, \"I want you to sign. . . .' We're both crying and she wouldn't.\" Finally Steiger literally twisted her arm, forcing her to sign, and he headed overseas.\n\nHe never knew his father. His parents split before he was a year old. \"My family laughed at me because my mother was an alcoholic. I must've sworn to myself one day that some day I would do something well enough that the name of Steiger would never be laughed at again. And this is the big thing in my life _ respect. And it goes all the way back to my childhood when we were disrespected by those around us,\" he says, stretching out his arms.\n\nWhen Steiger got out of the Navy 4{ years later, he was desperately searching for work and for a little of that \"respect.\" Through the Veterans Administration he got a janitorial job.\n\n\"They'd organized a theater group and there were no men in the group. And we descended like vultures. Suddenly we all wanted to become ac-TORS. We wanted to get all the girls if we could. I did one or two one-act plays. The first play I ever did was one called Helena's Husband. The woman who ran it said, \"You should take it seriously.' I'd never SEEN a play.\"\n\nWhen he started acting, he says he began to feel accepted. \"All of a sudden people are nicer to you and that was very good. So I was in my element. I had my false sense of freedom. I went to the New School of Social Research, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio. At one time I was going to all three at once so I was on stage once a week somewhere for two years. This is the smartest thing I did. I said I will not take a job until I have some idea what I'm doing; just like a mechanic, I'm going to learn the motor.\"\n\nSteiger became a master mechanic. Over the years he's played everybody from Napoleon to the Pope to an insignificant butcher in TV's Marty, which brought him to movies.\n\nHe's earned three Oscar nominations and won the best actor award for his red-necked sheriff in In the Heat of the Night.\n\nOn April 11, Turner Classic Movies offers a series of Steiger's work, starting with a one-hour interview at 8 p.m., In the Heat of the Night at 9; Al Capone at midnight; and Doctor Zhivago at 2 a.m.\n\nOn April 14 the network will air No Way to Treat a Lady at 8 p.m., The Harder they Fall at 10 p.m. and Jubal at midnight.\n\nThat stream of memorable performances was interrupted for nearly eight years when Steiger suffered from clinical depression.\n\n\"When somebody's been blue for three weeks, they're not depressed,\" he says. \"But if you're really estranged or blue to yourself for four to six weeks then you better go see somebody. With me it's a chemical imbalance. . . . With talk and medicines we pulled my way out of it. I was so afraid I wouldn't remember anything and wouldn't be able to act again.\"\n\nHe took action when his business manager advised him that he was running out of cash and would have to start selling his assets.\n\n\"When I found that out I got a picture to do in Argentina. I made sure it was as far away from this town as possible because of the damage of gossip and everything else in this town. I did it and was happy I got through it.\"\n\nMarried four times, Steiger is the father of a 40-year-old daughter (with actor Claire Bloom), who is an opera singer in Europe, and a 7-year-old son.\n\n\"I was married to Paula (his last wife) and wanted to have a son. I had nobody after me in my family. It took five years and finally, through artificial insemination and things like that . . . I was pleased to have a son because then I knew there was another Steiger on the Earth and the Earth was safe,\" he smiles."
