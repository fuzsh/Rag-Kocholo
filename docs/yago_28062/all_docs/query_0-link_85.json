        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Rod Steiger, the stocky, intense actor who played Marlon Brando's hoodlum brother in \"On the Waterfront\" and won an Oscar as a redneck Southern police chief in \"In the Heat of the Night,\" died Tuesday. He was 77.\n\nSteiger died at a hospital from pneumonia and kidney failure, which developed after his gallbladder was removed, publicist Lori DeWaal said.\n\nA devoted practitioner of Method acting, Steiger prided himself in taking challenging roles. He had more than 100 movie and television credits, convincingly portraying such figures as Mussolini, Rasputin, Pope John XXIII, Rudolf Hess, Pontius Pilate, Napoleon, W.C. Fields and Al Capone.\n\nScores of other roles were entirely forgettable.\n\n\"On the Waterfront,\" the 1954 blockbuster about racketeering on the New York and New Jersey docks in the 1950s, features one of the greatest exchanges ever put on film. As the two brothers ride in the back of a taxi, Brando castigates Steiger for making him throw a boxing match: \"I coulda had class! I coulda been a contender.\"\n\nThe film won seven Academy Awards, including honors for Brando and director Elia Kazan. Steiger had to make do with an Oscar nomination.\n\nHe won the Academy Award for best actor in 1967 for \"In the Heat of the Night,\" in which he played a bigoted lawman who grudgingly becomes the ally of a visiting black detective portrayed by Sidney Poitier. The film remains a riveting portrait of racial tension during the civil rights era.\n\nSteiger also received an Oscar nomination for the 1965 film \"The Pawnbroker.\" He played a Jew living a secluded life in Harlem, haunted by memories of his life in a Nazi camp. It was the film of which he was most proud.\n\n\"Rod Steiger was such a close friend as well as a great actor,\" said Norman Jewison, director of \"In the Heat of the Night.\" Jewison also directed Steiger in 1999's \"The Hurricane,\" starring Denzel Washington, and 1978's \"F.I.S.T.,\" starring Sylvester Stallone as a Jimmy Hoffa-like union boss.\n\n\"I always tried to put him in every film I did because to me, he was like an anchor for the rest of the cast,\" Jewison said.\n\nA specialty of Steiger's was historical figures - Napoleon in the 1970 film \"Waterloo,\" Pilate in the 1977 TV miniseries \"Jesus of Nazareth.\"\n\nSteiger admitted making a mistake in declining the starring role in \"Patton,\" believing the film would glorify war and killing. George C. Scott got the part, and it brought him an Oscar, which he refused.\n\nRodney Stephen Steiger was born April 14, 1925, in Westhampton, N.Y., the only child of a struggling song-and-dance team that parted soon after his birth. His mother married again, and the boy grew up in a quarrelsome household in Newark, N.J.\n\nSteiger was married and divorced four times - to Sally Gracie, actress Claire Bloom, Sherry Nelson and Paula Ellis. He and Bloom had a daughter, Anna, now an opera singer. He and Ellis had a son, Michael Winston, in 1993. In 2000, he married Joan Benedict.\n\nAn interviewer once asked Steiger how he would like to die. He replied: \"I don't want to, but if it's in front of a camera I wouldn't mind.\" His choice of an epitaph: \"See you later.\"\n\nArchive ID: 1038009"
