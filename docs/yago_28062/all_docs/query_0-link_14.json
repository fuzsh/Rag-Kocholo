        "text": "Married. Claire Bloom, 38, stage and screen actress, currently starring with ex-Husband Rod Steiger in 3 into 2 Won’t Go; and Hillard Elkins, 39, producer of off-Broadway’s nudest new revue, Oh! Calcutta!; she for the second time, he for the fourth; in Manhattan.\n\nMarried. The Most Rev. James P. Shannon, 48, recently resigned Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis; and Ruth Wilkinson, 50, a longtime friend and lifetime Protestant (see RELIGION).\n\nDivorced. Carroll Baker, 38, Hollywood’s aging Baby Doll, most recently in Sweet Body of Deborah; and Jack Garfein, 39, sometime director (The Strange One); after 14 years of marriage, two children; in Los Angeles.\n\nDied. William Goetz, 66, movie producer and studio executive; in Los Angeles. A son-in-law of Movie Tycoon Louis B. Mayer, Goetz helped found both 20th Century-Fox and Universal-International before striking out on his own in 1954. His hits included Sayonara, The Song of Bernadette, Winchester ’73, and he was among the first with the—now common practice—idea of giving top stars a percentage of the profits from their pictures.\n\nDied. Count Court Haugwitz Reventlow, 73, former Danish nobleman, second of Woolworth Heiress Barbara Hutton’s seven husbands and father of her only son, remembered for the violent custody battle for years after their marriage broke up in 1938; of heart disease; in Manhattan.\n\nDied. Lieut. General George Stratemeyer, 78, one of the country’s foremost air tacticians; of a heart attack; in Orlando, Fla. A veteran of the Burma and China campaigns during World War II, Stratemeyer pushed hard for a strong peacetime Air Force, and as commander in the Far East during the Korean War, he quickly established U.N. air superiority over the Communists.\n\nDied. Leonard Woolf, 88, author, editor and husband of Novelist Virginia Woolf; of a stroke; in Rodmell, England. His Hogarth Press published not only his wife’s novels but also poetry of T. S. Eliot, Freud’s Collected Papers, and works of E. M. Forster and Robert Graves. Woolf’s five-part autobiography (last volume to be published this fall) is considered a monument to a generation reared in peace, stunned by World War I and the great Depression, yet remaining optimistic that a new age of reason would dawn. In one anecdote, he recalls a day in 1939, when his wife called him to hear Hitler making a speech. “I shouted back: ‘I shan’t come. I’m planting iris and they will be flowering long after he is dead.’ “"
