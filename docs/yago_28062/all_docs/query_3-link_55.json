        "text": "Veteran screen heavy Rod Steiger, who won a Best Actor Oscar playing a redneck Southern police chief the 1967 film “In the Heat of the Night,” died yesterday in Los Angeles. He was 77.\n\nSteiger, who brought an explosive power to a wide range of roles – including Oscar-nominated turns as Marlon Brando’s racketeer brother in “On the Waterfront” (1954) and a haunted Holocaust survivor in “The Pawnbroker” (1964) – died of pneumonia and kidney failure, publicist Lori DeWaal said.\n\n“I’m 60 percent virgin and 40 percent whore,” the Method-trained actor once said about his career. “I’ve not sold out that much, and I’ve made my own mistakes.”\n\nRodney Stephen Steiger was born April 14, 1925, in Westhampton, L.I.\n\n“I left home at 15 because my family had been destroyed by alcoholism,” he remarked in 1998.\n\nLying about his age, he enlisted in the Navy at 16 and served in the South Pacific.\n\nAfter World War II, he studied drama at the New School for Social Research on the G.I. Bill.\n\nSteiger moved on to the American Theater Wing and then was accepted into the Actors Studio, joining a class that included Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden and Kim Stanley.\n\nHe appeared in more than 250 live TV dramas before “On the Waterfront” made him a major movie star. He was also noted for roles in “Oklahoma,” “Dr. Zhivago,” “The Chosen” and “The Hurricane” (1999).\n\nA man of large appetites, Steiger repeatedly became overweight and underwent a regimen to reduce. He was subject to periods of depression, and did little work in the 1980s.\n\nSteiger was married five times, the first four of which – to Sally Gracie, actress Claire Bloom, Sherry Nelson and Paula Ellis – ended in divorce. He had a daughter, Anna, with Bloom, and a son, Michael Winston, with Ellis.\n\nHe is survived by his widow, Joan Benedict.\n\nWith Post Wire Services"
