        "text": "NEW YORK -- Thirty years after she won acclaim from Charlie Chaplin's 'Limelight,' Claire Bloom is far enough into a trans-Atlantic acting career to have written a book about it.\n\nThe British actress was in New York the other day to talk about her just-published memoirs. And about her role as Lady Marchmain -- a sort of understated Mommie Dearest -- in the currently running Public Television series 'Brideshead Revisited.'\n\nThe 11-episode adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's novel about the decline and fall of a preposterously wealthy family of English Catholics focuses mostly on Lady Marchmain's son, Sebastian, and his very good friend Charles, the story's narrator.\n\nBut it is Miss Bloom as Lady Marchmain who drives everybody up the frescoed walls and makes the story go around.\n\nThe series also stars Sir Laurence Olivier as Lord Marchmain and another of Miss Bloom's old friends and early mentors, Sir John Gielgud, although they never saw one another during all the time it took to shoot 'Brideshead.'\n\n'We started three years ago and finished a year ago,' the actress said explaining there was a long break in the middle of shooting for a strike and for Jeremy Irons, who plays Charles Ryder, to star in the movie, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman.'\n\n'Brideshead' was filmed mostly at England's Castle Howard, a stately home so big it's a wonder anybody there ever runs into another human being.\n\n'It's very extraordinary,' said Miss Bloom. 'I think it's supposed to be the greatest house in the world, not just in England. I was invited to stay there, which was lucky. But it's a completely different world. All that responsibility.\n\n'I went home to London, where I live, and said, 'Thank God I'm middle class!'\n\nMiss Bloom's book, published on her 51st birthday, is called 'Limelight and After.' The title is meant to recall she won international fame overnight playing a young dancer nursed to health and pointed toward stardom by a fading British music hall entertainer, played by Chaplin.\n\nThe book's subtitle -- 'The Education of an Actress' -- is another clue to its contents. This is not one of those juicy, tell-all books of the Joan Collins genre, although Miss Bloom doubtless has a lot to tell. She married Rod Steiger in her late 20s, had a daughter and, after they split, married another American, Hillard Elkins. Elkins is a producer known for the still-running Broadway nudie musical 'Oh! Calcutta!'\n\nShe and Elkins later divorced and for the past several years Miss Bloom has shared her life on both sides of the Atlantic with yet another Yankee, Philip Roth, whose novels include 'Portnoy's Complaint.'\n\nSteiger, with whom Miss Bloom made '3 Into 2 Won't Go' and 'The Illustrated Man,' isn't mentioned until the last 30 pages, and Messrs. Elkins and Roth not at all.\n\n'I'm much too clever to say anything personal about anybody,' Miss Bloom said cheerily. 'I've writen about my childhood and my family - the things that made me want to become an actress, the things I presume have made me pursue it so single-mindedly. And successfully.\n\n'So many things happened to me before I was 22.'\n\nThey include her introduction to the United States as a wartime refugee. She found New York exciting but not Florida, where she and her mother and younger brother spent time with relatives. She's never been back.\n\nLondon remains her home. 'But I try to be here three months of the year -- in Connecticut where we live.'\n\n'We' means Roth. Her relationship with the best-selling author apparently has survived his recent stint as an editor of her book.\n\n'At the end of each week or so I showed him what I had written, and it was a very frightening experence -- to show your novice work to a writer of that caliber. He was very hard, and accurate, and devastatingly cruel,' an assessment punctuated with a Lady Marchmain smile.\n\nHer book mentions such movies as 'Richard III' with Olivier, 'Look Back in Anger' and 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,' both with Richard Burton, and 'The Outrage' with Paul Newman -- pictures 'that are important for me.' Others such as 'Charly,' which won an Oscar for Cliff Robertson, go unnoted. 'There wasn't much to say about it.'\n\nMiss Bloom says she studied a Southern accent for three months before playing Blanche in a London stage production of Tennessee Williams' 'A Street Car Named Desire,' but had to say no more recently when asked to play Lady Bird Johnson in a still unmade TV movie that was going to star Robert Mitchum at LBJ. 'There are certain things I simply can't do, and a Texas accent is one of them.'\n\nIn 'Limelight and After' Miss Bloom draws comparisons between certain roles -- the ethereal Blance was 'not so far' from the Juliet she played to Paul Scofield's Romeo at Stratford-on-Avon.\n\nLady Marchmain in 'Brideshead Revisited' is something else.\n\n'I wracked my brains to think of anybody even vaguely like her. And, of course, nobody is. Among my few acquaintances in the aristocracy there was one very great Catholic lady, so at least in her voice I tried to use some of her particular ways of speaking in a strange, elliptical way. But there was nobody I ever played like that.'"
