However, he never knew his father, a vaudevillian who had been part of a touring song-and-dance team with his mother. Steiger's mother, meanwhile, became an alcoholic after giving up acting due to a leg impairment. With his mother, he moved through several towns before settling in Newark, New Jersey. In addition to his mother's alcoholism, Steiger was deeply affected as a child by a sexual assault he endured from a pedophile. He found his passion for the arts while attending West Side High School, where he acted in a number of school plays. When he was 16, Steiger ran away from home and joined the US Navy during World War II. He saw action in the South Pacific as a torpedoman on destroyers. After the war, Steiger secured rent and four years of schooling through the GI Bill. He attended the Civil Service Little Theater group and did a course at the New School for Social Research.\n\nFilm Career in the 1950s and 60s\n\nSteiger made his big-screen debut with a small part in Fred Zinnemann's 1951 romantic drama \"Teresa.\" His breakthrough came three years later in Elia Kazan's crime drama \"On the Waterfront,\" in which he played Charley, the brother of Marlon Brando's main character Terry. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and earned Steiger his first nomination, for Best Supporting Actor.
