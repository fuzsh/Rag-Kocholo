Rod Steiger, the Oscar-winning actor, has died in Los Angeles at the age of 77.

The star, once married to British actress Claire Bloom, won a best actor for his 1967 role in movie classic In the Heat of the Night.

His publicist, Lori De Waal, said Steiger died at a Los Angeles hospital of pneumonia and kidney failure at 9am (1600 GMT).

During his long career in television and the movies, Steiger played a wide range of roles. He liked the challenge of playing real-life people, taking on the roles of Mussolini, Rasputin, Napoleon and Al Capone.

He once said: "My generation of actors was taught to be able to create different people; that's what an actor is supposed to do."

Steiger received his first film roles in the early 1950s and his first major performance was in Teresa (1951). His breakthrough performance came in 1954, with On the Waterfront where he starred opposite Marlon Brando.

Ever since then he played everything from a popular leading man to a little known character actor. Steiger played the title character in Al Capone in 1959 and also starred in the D-Day biopic The Longest Day.

His other films included The Pawnbroker for which he received an Oscar nomination, Doctor Zhivago and No Way to Treat a Lady (1969).

He famously turned down the lead role in the film Patton believing the film would glorify war and killing. That role was taken by George C Scott who won an Oscar for it.

His mother remarried and took her son to grow up in Newark, New Jersey. At sixteen he lied about his aged and joined the army, going on to fight in the South Pacific.

Back in New Jersey after the war, Steiger worked at a menial job and joined a drama group of office workers.
