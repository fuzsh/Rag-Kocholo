The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room SD-430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders, chairman of the subcommittee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders, Baldwin, Murphy, and Warren. Opening Statement of Senator Sanders Senator Sanders. Let me thank our wonderful panelists for being here to discuss an issue of huge consequence for our country. I think what will be happening during the morning is Senators will be drifting in and out. It is a particularly busy time. But the issue that we are going to be discussing is something that needs to be worked on a whole lot. The first point that has to be made is that in this great country, we see huge disparities in terms of how long people live; life expectancy. I think people would be shocked if they knew that in this country--just between neighborhoods in a given city or areas of our country--you will find in one place people living rather long and healthy lives, and in other parts of the country, people living much shorter lives often plagued by illness. One point that I want to make is that when we talk about poverty, I think a lot of people say, ``Well, somebody is poor who maybe lives in inadequate housing, and that is just too bad,'' or may not have a good automobile, or may not even be able to go to college, or afford to go to college; all of that is true. But poverty and the stress of poverty is much, much more than that, and in many ways in our country, the stress of poverty is a death sentence which results in significantly shorter life expectancy. One of our witnesses today, Dr. Kindig, published a paper earlier this year in ``Health Affairs'' showing that female mortality rose--rose--in the United States in 43 percent of U.S. counties between 1992 and 2006. That women in those counties are actually dying at a younger age. The goal of everything that we do in this sense, is that we strive to figure out ways in which people can live longer and happier lives. That is really what it is about. People may disagree about how to get there, but that is the goal. But when we find that female mortality rose in 43 percent of U.S. counties between 1992 and 2006, that is a profound reality that has got to be dealt with. Right here in the Nation's Capital, in Washington, DC, life expectancy varies from 77 years in the District to 84 years in Montgomery County just a few metro stops away; a 7 year difference in life expectancy for women. The county with the highest life expectancy is Marin County in northern California where the average life expectancy is 85 years, which stacks up pretty well with the rest of the world. We, as a Nation, are behind many other countries in terms of life expectancy and that, in itself, is worthy of serious discussion. In Marin County, CA, women live to be 85 years of age, which is good. The lowest in the Nation is Perry County, KY with an average life expectancy for women of 73 years; 12 years less in the United States of America. For men, the highest life expectancy occurs in nearby Fairfax County outside of Washington, DC where the average is 82 years for men; that is pretty good. This compares to a life expectancy of 64 years for men in McDowell County, WV where one of our guests is from. That is an 18-year gap within the United States of America. Men born in Marin County will live 18 years longer than men in McDowell County, WV. One of our witnesses today, Sabrina Shrader, grew up in McDowell County, WV, where men have the same average life expectancy as men in Botswana or Namibia. Women in McDowell County have shorter lives than women in El Salvador or Mongolia, and the gaps in life expectancy within our country are widening, and today's hearing will call attention to this troubling fact. We know that there are disparities in life expectancy based on gender, race, and socioeconomic status. It is becoming increasingly clear that education plays a critical role of determining how long someone will live. Those without a high school education in the United States, of all races, live shorter lives and experience poorer health than those with higher levels of education. In fact, a white woman without a high school education saw her life expectancy drop 5 years from 1990 to 2008. The issue that we want to explore today is why that is so. Why we are seeing, in some cases, people in our country living shorter lives than their parents did? We want to look at why this disparity exists. We want to understand almost the physiology of what poverty is about. What does stress mean? What does it mean if you wake up in the morning, and you are not quite sure if you and your kids are going to have enough food? If you do not have a job, what does it mean to you, personally, and how does that result overall in shortening your life? This is a very important and profound discussion, and we are so pleased to have our knowledgeable panelists with us. I see Senator Warren here. Senator Warren, do you want to make some opening remarks? Statement of Senator Warren Senator Warren. Thank you very much, Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much for calling this hearing and thank you all for being with us today. I will be brief because I want to get to your questions so that we can ask more, but I do want to say after reading our notes, this is something you and I have talked about a lot. Our witnesses have highlighted how the health of our citizens is tied to our economy. We know that income is one of the best predictors of life expectancy, as you have pointed out, but I would add, that it is also one of the best indicators of other health problems--asthma, diabetes, mental health disorders, the list is just starting--in which we know that income has a profound influence on the likelihood of having those problems and the severity of those problems. So when we talk about reducing costs in the healthcare system and improving the health of Americans generally, I think we have to take a step back and take a very hard look at what is happening to the economy in the United States; how these things fit together. How greater income inequality is having a profound effect, not only on the economic life of Americans, but also on their health and the health of their children. With that, I want to go straight to hearing from our witnesses if we can. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Sanders. We certainly can, and thanks very much. Our first witness is Dr. Steven Woolf. Dr. Woolf is a professor of family medicine and population health, and director of the Center on Society and Health at the Virginia Commonwealth University; an expert on primary care and public health. He received his training at Emory University, Johns Hopkins University, and Virginia Commonwealth University, and has worked for 25 years in academic and public policy settings. Dr. Woolf, thanks so much for being with us. STATEMENT OF STEVEN WOOLF, M.D., MPH, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER ON SOCIETY AND HEALTH, AND PROFESSOR OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND POPULATION HEALTH, VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY, RICHMOND, VA Dr. Woolf. Thank you, Senator Sanders. Thank you, Senator Warren. It is a pleasure to be here to testify on this important issue. Our Center, the Center on Society and Health study how factors outside of healthcare shape health outcomes. One such factor is income. The lower people's income, the earlier they die and the sicker they live. The poor have higher rates of a long list of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, depression, and disability, as Senator Warren mentioned. But it is not just the poor. The health of working-class and middle-class, and even upper-class Americans also rises and falls with our socioeconomic status. Take this for example, 68 percent of American adults have an income that is more than twice the poverty level. Suppose we boosted that number just slightly from 68 percent to 70 percent and looked at the impact on one disease, diabetes. That higher income would mean about 400,000 fewer cases of diabetes, saving $2.5 billion dollars per year to treat that one disease. If economic conditions matter so greatly to health and healthcare costs, the reverse is also true. Harder times for the middle class and the poor mean that Americans and their children will get sicker and die earlier. Already, the health of Americans is inferior to that of people in other high-income countries. I recently chaired an expert panel convened by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine. We compared the United States with 16 other high-income countries and found that Americans die earlier and have higher rates of disease and injury. The U.S. health disadvantage exists for men and women, for young and old, and as this table shows on the easel, across multiple areas of health from infant mortality to traffic fatalities, from teen pregnancies to diseases of the heart and lungs, diabetes, and disability. American children are less likely to reach age 5 than children in other rich Nations. Our babies are less likely to reach their first birthday. Our rate for premature babies is similar to sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. health disadvantage is not restricted to the poor and minorities; it is seen among all social classes, the rich and poor, more-educated and less-educated Americans. But the problem is clearly worse for those with less-income, and the socioeconomic picture for the average American family is not good. Although in aggregate our Nation is wealthy, we have high rates of income inequality, and thus, high poverty rates. For three decades, we have had the highest child poverty rate in the industrialized world. These conditions affect health and when we die. Consider my State, Virginia, home to the two most affluent counties in the country, but also home to rural areas with deep poverty. Our Center found that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia would be averted if everyone had the death rate of Virginia's five most affluent areas. Let me repeat, that is one out four deaths. This reflects not just the difference in the loss of the people who live in those counties, but the economic and social capital of the communities themselves. These differences produce big gaps in life expectancy across a matter of miles. We produced a metro map of Washington, DC showing that lives are 7 years shorter in DC than in the Maryland suburbs at the end of the Red Line, as Senator Sanders mentioned. In New Orleans, if you can show the next map, we found that a baby born in ZIP Code 70112 can expect to live 25 fewer years than a baby born in ZIP Code 70124. Neighborhoods in Boston and Baltimore have a lower life expectancy than Ethiopia and Sudan. Azerbaijan has a higher life expectancy than areas of Chicago. What is the take away for Congress? First of all, it is that economic policy is not just economic policy, it is health policy. Pocketbook issues affect disease rates and how long Americans live. Strategies to strengthen the middle class and relieve poverty can prevent costly diseases like diabetes, which leads to the second major takeaway: relieving economic hardship for Americans is a smart way for Congress to control medical spending. Spiraling healthcare costs are a big concern here in Congress and in corporate America. We are all searching for ways to bend the cost curve. What better way than reducing the flow of disease into the system? Earlier I mentioned that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia could be averted. No form of healthcare reform and no treatments by doctors and hospitals can rival that kind of effect. The third takeaway is that health is affected not only by what is in your bank account, but also by policies that put people on the road to economic success such as helping our young people get a good education. Investments in early childhood are key to our Nation's future and to their life expectancy. Legislation that puts American families on a stronger footing, and strengthens the physical and social environment in which they live, like those neighborhoods in New Orleans and Baltimore, can be good for the economy and public health, thereby curbing healthcare costs. The opposite is true: cutting these programs in an attempt to save money could save nothing if it makes people sicker and thereby drives up medical spending. A sicker population means a sicker workforce, making American businesses less competitive and our military less fit for duty. Our economy, and national security, cannot afford this and nor can our people. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Woolf follows:] Prepared Statement of Steven Woolf, M.D., MPH Thank you, Senators Sanders and Burr. I'm Steven Woolf and I appreciate the opportunity to testify this morning. I'm a family physician and I direct Virginia Commonwealth University's Center on Society and Health. Our center studies how factors outside of health care shape health outcomes. One such factor is income. This committee needs no reminders about the importance of income to American families. What's perhaps less apparent is how greatly economic conditions affect the health of adults and children--and by extension the costs of health care. The lower people's income, the earlier they die and the sicker they live. The poor have higher rates of a long list of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, depression, and disability. Children raised in poverty grow up with more illnesses. But it's not just the poor. The health of working class and middle class and even upper class Americans also rises and falls with their socioeconomic status. Let's look at an example: 68 percent of American adults have an income that is more than twice the poverty level. Suppose we boosted that number just slightly, from 68 percent to 70 percent and looked at the impact on one disease--diabetes. That higher income would mean about 400 million fewer cases of diabetes, saving $2 billion per year to treat that disease. If economic conditions matter so greatly to health and health care costs, the reverse is also true. Subjecting the middle class and the poor to harder times means that Americans, and their children, will get sicker and die earlier. Already, the health of Americans is inferior to that of people in other high-income countries. I recently chaired an expert panel convened by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine. We compared the United States with 16 other high-income countries and found that Americans die earlier and we have higher rates of disease and injury. This U.S. health disadvantage exists for men and women, for young and old, and across multiple areas of health, from infant mortality to traffic fatalities, from teen pregnancies to diseases of the heart and lung, diabetes, and disability. American children are less likely to reach age 5 than children in other rich nations. Our babies are less likely to reach their first birthday. Our rate for premature babies is similar to sub-Saharan Africa and our teenagers are sicker than teens elsewhere. The U.S. health disadvantage is not restricted to the poor and minorities. It's seen among all social classes, the rich and poor, more-educated and less-educated, whites and people of color. But the problem is clearly worse for those with less income, and the socioeconomic picture for the average American family is not good. Although in aggregate our Nation is wealthy, we have notoriously high rates of income inequality and thus for three decades our relative poverty rates, especially child poverty rates, have been the highest in the industrialized world. America is the land of opportunity but studies show that the ability of a poor child to climb the economic ladder and escape poverty is lower here than elsewhere. These conditions affect health--and when we die. Consider my State, Virginia--home to the two most affluent counties in the country but also home to rural areas with deep poverty. Our center found that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia would be averted if everyone had the death rate of Virginia's five most affluent areas. Let me repeat--one out of four deaths. What this reflects is not just a difference in the wealth of the people living in those counties but the economic vitality, infrastructure, and social capital of the communities themselves. Together, these factors produce vast differences in life expectancy across small distances. We produced this metro map of Washington, DC, showing that lives are 7 years shorter in DC than in the Maryland suburbs at the end of the Red Line. In New Orleans, we found that a baby born in zip code 70112 can expect to live 25 fewer years than a baby born in zip code 70124.

What better way than reducing the flow of disease into the system? Earlier I mentioned that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia could be averted. No form of health care reform, and no treatments by doctors and hospitals, can rival that kind of effect. The third takeaway is that health is affected not only by what's in your bank account but also, perhaps more importantly, by policies that put people on the road to economic success, such as helping our young people get a good education. Deaths from diabetes are three times higher for Americans without a high school diploma. Investments in early childhood are keys to our Nation's future, and to their life expectancy. The laws you pass that strengthen the physical and social environment in which Americans live, like those neighborhoods in New Orleans and Baltimore, can both grow the economy and also save lives and curb health care costs. And now to my last point: Many of these programs are in jeopardy because of fiscal pressures to cut spending. Education reform, job training, urban renewal, and safety net programs may not seem like health expenditures but they affect health and medical spending nonetheless. There are forms of discretionary spending that are keys to curbing entitlement spending on health care. Slashing these programs could be counterproductive. I urge Congress to consider how proposed cuts outside the health sector will affect disease rates. Cutting a program to save money may save nothing if it makes people sicker and thereby drives up the costs of health care. And a sicker population means a sicker workforce, making American businesses less competitive and our military less fit for duty. Our economy and national security can't afford this, and nor can our people. ______ Attachment By Steven H. Woolf * and Paula Braveman Where Health Disparities Begin: The Role of Social And Economic Determinants--And Why Current Policies May Make Matters Worse Abstract: Health disparities by racial or ethnic group or by income or education are only partly explained by disparities in medical care. Inadequate education and living conditions--ranging from low income to the unhealthy characteristics of neighborhood and communities--can harm health through complex pathways. Meaningful progress in narrowing health disparities is unlikely without addressing these root causes. Policies on education, child care, jobs, community and economic revitalization, housing, transportation, and land use bear on these root causes and have implications for health and medical spending. A shortsighted political focus on reducing spending in these areas could actually increase medical costs by magnifying disease burden and widening health disparities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Steven H. Woolf ([email protected]) is the director of the Center on Human Needs and a professor in the Department of Family Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond. Paula Braveman is the director of the Center on Social Disparities in Health at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a professor of family and community medicine at UCSF. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2003 the landmark Institute of Medicine report Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care drew needed attention to disparities in the health care of racial and ethnic minorities.\\1\\ The response from the health care and policy communities included new initiatives to standardize treatments for racial and ethnic minorities, heighten providers' cultural competency, and increase minority representation among health care professionals. Although some disparities in health care have narrowed, disparities in the health of minority and disadvantaged populations have persisted. Since the 1960s, the mortality rate for blacks has been 50 percent higher than that for whites, and the infant mortality rate for blacks has been twice as high as that for whites.\\2\\ \\3\\ Health disparities exist even in health care systems that offer patients similar access to care, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs,\\4\\ which suggests that disparities originate outside the formal health care setting. social determinants of health Understanding health disparities requires a fresh look at the determinants of health itself, the most obvious being intrinsic biological attributes such as age, sex, and genes. Some other risk factors that affect health are referred to as ``downstream'' determinants because they are often shaped by ``upstream'' societal conditions. Downstream determinants include medical care; environmental factors, such as air pollution; and health behaviors, such as smoking, seeking or forgoing medical care, and not adhering to treatment guidelines.\\5\\ Exposure to these determinants is influenced by ``upstream'' social determinants of health--personal resources such as education and income and the social environments in which people live, work, study, and engage in recreational activities. These contextual conditions influence people's exposure to environmental risks and their personal health behaviors, vulnerability to illness, access to care, and ability to manage conditions at home--for example, the ability of patients with diabetes to adopt necessary lifestyle changes to control their blood sugar.\\6\\ \\7\\ \\8\\ \\9\\ \\10\\ \\11\\ \\12\\ Social determinants are often the root causes of illnesses and are key to understanding health disparities. Income. Income--with education, one of the most familiar social determinants--has a striking association with health (Exhibit 1).\\11\\ Paula Braveman and Susan Egerter have shown that U.S. adults living in poverty are more than five times as likely to report being in fair or poor health as adults with incomes at least four times the Federal poverty level.\\8\\ The income-health relationship is not restricted to the poor: Studies of Americans at all income levels reveal inferior health outcomes when compared to Americans at higher income levels.\\10\\ [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] That income is important to health might not be surprising to some, but the magnitude of the relationship is not always appreciated. For example, Nancy Krieger and colleagues estimated that 14 percent of premature deaths among whites and 30 percent of premature deaths among blacks between 1960 and 2002 would not have occurred if everyone had experienced the mortality rates of whites in the highest income quintile.\\13\\ Steven Woolf and coauthors calculated that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia between 1996 and 2002 would have been averted if the mortality rates of the five most affluent counties and cities had applied statewide.\\14\\ Peter Muennig and colleagues estimated that living on incomes of less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level claimed more than 400 million quality-adjusted life-years between 1997 and 2002, meaning that poverty had a larger effect than tobacco use and obesity.\\15\\ Such estimates rely on certain assumptions and do not prove causality. However, the consistency of the evidence supports the conclusion that income, or the conditions associated with income, are important determinants of health. Education. Like income, education has a large influence on health (Exhibit 2). An extensive literature documents large health disparities among adults with different levels of education. Adults without a high school diploma or equivalent are three times as likely as those with a college education to die before age 65.\\16\\ The average 25-year-old with less than 12 years' education lives almost 7 fewer years than someone with at least 16 years' education.\\10\\ Children's health is also strongly linked to their parents' education.\\10\\ [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] According to Irma Elo and Samuel Preston, every additional year in educational attainment reduces the odds of dying by 1-3 percent.\\17\\ Ahmedin Jemal and colleagues reported that approximately 50 percent of all male deaths and 40 percent of all female deaths at ages 25-64 would not occur if everyone experienced the mortality rates of college graduates.\\18\\ Woolf and coauthors estimated that giving all U.S. adults the mortality rate of adults with some college education would save seven lives for every life saved by biomedical advances.\\19\\ Stark racial or ethnic differences in education and income could largely explain the poorer health of blacks and some other minorities. The high school dropout rate is 18.3 percent among Hispanics, 9.9 percent among blacks, and 4.8 percent among non-Hispanic whites. The proportion of Hispanic adults with less than 7 years of elementary school education is 20 times that of non-Hispanic whites. Black and Hispanic households earned two-thirds the income of non-Hispanic whites and were three times as likely to live in poverty.\\20\\ As of 2009 white households had 20 times the net worth of black households.\\21\\ A Web of Conditions. Education and income are elements of a web of social and economic conditions that affect health (and influence each other) in complex ways over a lifetime. These conditions include employment, wealth, neighborhood characteristics, and social policies as well as culture and beliefs about health--for example, the belief that diseases are ordained by fate and therefore not preventable. People with low education and income are more likely than their better- educated, higher income counterparts to lack a job, health insurance, and disposable income for medical expenses. Education and income are also associated with behaviors that affect health. Smoking is three times as prevalent among adults without a high school diploma than among college graduates.\\2\\ Similar patterns exist for other unhealthy behaviors, such as physical inactivity. the role of neighborhoods and communities Unhealthy behavior is partly a matter of personal choice, but extensive evidence documents the strong influence of the environment in which people live and work.\\5\\ \\6\\ \\11\\ \\12\\ One may desire to eat a healthy diet but find nutritious foods too costly or live too far from a supermarket that sells fresh produce.\\5\\ Parents might want to limit the time their children spend in front of a television or computer in favor of sending them outdoors for exercise, but their neighborhoods may be unsafe or lack playgrounds or sidewalks. The built environment--for example, the design of roads and pedestrian routes--can thwart efforts to walk or bicycle to the store or work. Poor and minority neighborhoods are often ``food deserts'' with limited access to healthy foods but numerous fast-food outlets.\\5\\ Schools in low-income neighborhoods often serve inexpensive processed foods and rely on revenue from vending machine contracts that promote soft drinks and high-calorie snacks.\\5\\ But behavior is not the whole story.\\11\\ \\12\\ Distressed homes and neighborhoods can induce disease and contribute to disparities via pathways unrelated to behavior.\\8\\ For example, housing can expose occupants to lead and allergens. Bus depots, factories, highways, and hazardous waste sites are often situated near low-income and minority neighborhoods.\\22\\ Distressed communities have a notorious shortage of health care providers, especially in primary care. Social conditions are also important. Health may be compromised by the chronic stress of living amid multiple adverse conditions, such as poverty, unemployment, urban blight, and crime. Communities of color-- especially minority youth--are targets of advertising that promotes the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and high-calorie foods.\\5\\ Impoverished neighborhoods may have residents who are less able to help their neighbors. These neighborhoods may also have reduced social cohesion--which can influence health behavior; the sense of security and social well-being experienced by members of the community; and the ability of individuals within a community to join forces to advocate for needed services.\\11\\ For example, minority neighborhoods with poor social cohesion may be unable to mount effective political opposition to decisions that will affect local schools or air quality. Entrenched patterns reflecting long-standing disadvantage in low- income and minority neighborhoods often perpetuate cycles of socioeconomic failure. Employment opportunities and good schools may be scarce. Low-income residents often cannot afford to move elsewhere. Traveling across town to find a job--or a better one--or to reach a supermarket or doctor may be difficult if public transportation is unavailable or costly. biological pathways to health disparities Sandro Galea and colleagues recently estimated that of the 2.8 million deaths in the United States in 2000, 245,000 were attributable to low education, 176,000 to racial segregation, 162,000 to low social support, 133,000 to individual-level poverty, and 119,000 to income inequality.\\23\\ How do these conditions claim lives? Research has identified several plausible pathways. For example, people living with inadequate resources often experience stress levels that can cause the brain to stimulate endocrine organs to produce hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine, at levels that may alter immune function or cause inflammation. Repeated or sustained exposure to these substances may produce ``wear and tear'' on organs and precipitate chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\\11\\ \\24\\ Other research suggests that the most profound health effects of living conditions may be delayed consequences that unfold over the span of a lifetime.\\25\\ Experiences in the womb and early childhood, including stress, can have lasting effects that do not manifest themselves until late adulthood--or even in the next generation. An adult mother's childhood experiences can leave a biological imprint that affects the neurological and mental development of her offspring. Even the effects of genes can be modified by the environment. New research in the field of epigenetics--the study of inherited changes in gene expression--suggests that the social and physical environment can activate the expression of genes and thus can determine whether a disease develops. This epigenetic makeup can be passed on to children and influence the occurrence of disease in more than one generation.\\11\\ Although more remains to be investigated and understood, the fact that many social determinants have an impact on health makes scientific sense. declining incomes and increasing inequality Given that income contributes greatly to health disparities, the decline in the average income of Americans since 1999 and other signs of economic hardship are troubling. Between 2000 and 2009 food insecurity (defined as limited or uncertain access to adequate food), severe housing cost burdens (spending more than 50 percent of income on housing), and homelessness increased in the United States.\\20\\ By 2010 the U.S. poverty rate had reached 15.1 percent, its highest percentage since 1993.\\26\\ The gap between the rich and poor has been widening since 1968, especially recently.\\26\\ Between 2005 and 2009 the share of wealth held by the top 10 percent of the population increased from 49 percent to 56 percent. Over the same period, the average net worth of white households fell by 16 percent, from $134,992 to $113,149; the average net worth of black and Hispanic households fell by 53 percent (from $12,124 to $5,677) and 66 percent (from $18,359 to $6,325), respectively.\\21\\ The fact that the average American's income and wealth are shrinking has important health implications. Since 1980, when the United States ranked 14th in life expectancy among industrialized countries, the U.S. ranking has been declining. By 2008 the United States ranked 25th in life expectancy, behind such countries as Portugal and Slovenia.\\27\\ The United States has also not kept pace with other industrialized countries in terms of infant mortality and other health indicators.\\27\\ Various explanations have been proposed, ranging from unhealthier behavior on the part of Americans to deficiencies in the U.S. health care system. However, a persistent question is whether U.S. health status is slipping because of unfavorable societal conditions. Other industrialized countries outperform the United States in education, have lower child poverty rates, and maintain a stronger safety net to help disadvantaged families maintain their health. policies, macroeconomics, and societal structure Economic opportunity, the vibrancy of neighborhoods, and access to education and income are conditions set by society, not by physicians, hospitals, health plans, or even the public health community. The leaders who can best address the root causes of disparities may be the decisionmakers outside of health care who are in a position to strengthen schools, reduce unemployment, stabilize the economy, and restore neighborhood infrastructure. Policymakers in these sectors may have greater opportunity than health care leaders to narrow health disparities. The key change agents may be those working in education reform to help students finish high school and obtain college degrees, and those crafting economic policies to create jobs and teach workers marketable skills. Even public health efforts to reduce smoking and obesity demonstrate that policy can often achieve more than clinical interventions. Policies to restrict indoor smoking and increase cigarette prices did more to reduce tobacco use in the past 20 years than relying on physicians to counsel smokers to quit.\\28\\ The most influential change agents in efforts to help Americans eat well and stay active may be the agencies and business interests that determine advertising messages, supermarket locations, school lunch menus, after-school and summer sports programs, food labels, and the built environment. Key actors include city planners, State officials, Federal agencies, legislatures at both the State and Federal levels, employers, school boards, zoning commissions, developers, supermarket chains, restaurants, and industries ranging from soda bottlers to transit companies. Initiatives by hospitals, medical societies, and insurers to reduce health care disparities remain vital, but the front line in narrowing health disparities lies beyond health care. the ``health in all policies'' movement Increasingly, governments and businesses are being encouraged to consider the consequences to health, and to health disparities, of proposed policies in transportation, housing, education, taxes, land use, and so forth--a ``health in all policies'' approach. For example, a city council might replace an abandoned warehouse with a public park or offer tax incentives for supermarkets to locate in a ``food desert'' neighborhood. Health impact assessments are being commissioned to study the potential health consequences of policies concerning such diverse topics as minimum wage laws and freeway widening.\\29\\ The ``health in all policies'' approach has been adopted by individual communities, State governments, and Federal initiatives, including the interagency health promotion council established under the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\\30\\ This holistic approach to public policy comes at the recommendation of prestigious commissions sponsored by the World Health Organization,\\6\\ MacArthur Foundation,\\7\\ and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\\8\\ Studies in the Bay Area \\31\\ and New York City,\\32\\ for example; the acclaimed 2008 documentary film Unnatural Causes \\33\\; and major initiatives by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation,\\34\\ California Endowment,\\35\\ and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \\36\\ have all reinforced the message that ``place matters.'' Armed with a new field of research that collects data at the neighborhood level, communities are beginning to document and rectify local social and environmental conditions that foment health disparities. linking social policy to health disparities Although some academics and policymakers understand the health impact of social determinants, the general public and other policymakers do not always recognize that social policy and health policy are intimately linked. Social policies are clearly of concern for reasons other than their health consequences. The recession has riveted the Nation's attention on the need for jobs and economic growth. Politicians view the economic plight of voters as an election issue. The missing piece is that advocates for jobs, education, and other issues often overlook the health argument in making their case or calculating the return on investment. Public programs to address failing schools, disappearing jobs, and needed community development are under scrutiny as the fiscal crisis forces spending cuts to balance budgets and reduce the national debt. Defending these programs requires more than just making moral arguments for their retention and expansion. It requires proponents to make a solid business case, but the value proposition should include the medical spending avoided by having these programs in place. Advocates for education or jobs programs often list important benefits, such as a more competitive workforce, job security, and economic growth. However, they could gather more support, especially from policymakers concerned about medical spending, by showing that disease rates--and hence health care costs--are connected to education, employment, and socioeconomic well-being. For example, the health connection strengthens the business case for education. Henry Levin and colleagues reported that interventions to improve high school graduation rates among black males yield $166,000 per graduate in net savings to the government as a result of higher tax revenues and lower public health costs and crime rates.\\37\\ Muennig and Woolf estimated that the health benefits of reducing elementary school classroom sizes yield $168,000 in net savings per high school graduate.\\38\\ Robert Schoeni and coauthors estimated that giving all Americans the health status of college-educated adults would generate more than $1 trillion per year in health benefits.\\39\\ Making the connection between social determinants and medical spending heightens the relevance of social policy to a pressing national priority: the spiraling costs of health care, which have alarmed elected officials, employers, health plans, and the public. Whether any proposed remedy--from malpractice reform to the implementation of accountable care organizations--can bend the cost curve remains uncertain. The gravitational pull of health care has kept the policy focus on reorganizing care, implementing information technology, and reforming the payment system, with less consideration of issues outside of medicine--even though they might curb the flow of patients into the system and reduce spending more dramatically. Bobby Milstein and coauthors recently calculated that expanding health insurance coverage and improving health care would do less to save lives and control medical spending than policies to improve environmental conditions and promote healthier behavior.\\40\\ Remedies outside of health care can both reduce the cost of care and ameliorate health disparities. An example is diabetes, a disease of rising prevalence and costs. Diabetes occurs among adults without a high school diploma at twice the rate observed among college graduates.\\2\\ This disparity should speak volumes to policymakers seeking to control spending on this disease--and those tempted to cut education budgets to finance health care. why this matters now These issues need attention now, for four reasons. First, this is a time of worsening socioeconomic conditions and rising inequality, fomented by the recession and economic policies. Higher disease burden, greater medical spending, and widened disparities could result. The programs that could cushion stresses on children and families are now vulnerable to budget reductions. Second, exposing children to today's adverse social conditions has ramifications for the health of tomorrow's adults. It has already been predicted that this generation could, for the first time in U.S. history, live shorter lives than its predecessors because of the obesity epidemic.\\41\\ Children's exposure to worsening socioeconomic conditions from fetal life through adolescence could alter the trajectory of their health, making them more likely to develop disease later in life.\\25\\ These outcomes could intensify demands on a health care system that is already too costly to sustain. Third, the very programs that could cushion stresses on children and families are now vulnerable to proposed budget reductions. Programs that help people get an education, find a job that can lift a family out of poverty, or provide healthy food and stable housing are being eliminated to balance budgets. This strategy, however, could backfire if it precipitates disease, drives more patients into the health care system, and increases medical spending. Fourth, presidential and congressional elections are fast approaching, and many politicians are eager to exhibit their fiscal conservatism by reducing the size of government and eliminating social programs. The zeal to cut spending may discourage thoughtful consideration of how such cuts might expose voters to greater illness or harm the economy. It may be naive to hope that elected officials will rise above reelection concerns to address outcomes that will outlast their term in office and promote the greater good. It may be more realistic to hope that the public and policymakers will begin to connect the dots and see health as a by-product of the environment in which Americans live. They might come to see that decisions about child care, schools, jobs, and economic revitalization are ultimately decisions about health--and the costs of health care. Social issues lack quick and easy solutions. Politics surrounds questions of how best to educate children and improve the economic well-being of American families. However, scientific knowledge now makes it clear that the current movement to shrink investments in these areas has implications for public health and the costs of medical care. Fiscally prudent politicians (and voters) who learn about the medical price tag associated with austere economic and social policies may question the logic of ``cutting spending'' in ways that ultimately increase costs. For the health equity movement, the challenge is to clarify this connection for policymakers and to not focus exclusively on how physicians and hospitals can reduce disparities. Equitable health care is essential, but health disparities will persist--as they have for generations--until attention turns to the root causes outside the clinic.

COMMENTARY Public Health Implications of Government Spending Reductions * (By: Steven H. Woolf, MD, MPH) Across the United States, concerns over budget deficits and a weak economy have prompted Federal, State, and local governments to propose controversial spending reductions to balance their budgets. Debates and protests incited by these decisions dominate the news, but what is their relevance to medicine? The reflexive answer might be that government spending policies are relevant if they compromise health care services, essential public health programs, or biomedical research. However, the biggest threat to public health may come from funding cuts outside the health sector. Namely, budget decisions that affect basic living conditions--removing opportunities for education, employment, food security, and stable neighborhoods--could arguably have greater disease significance than disruptions in health care. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Note: Author Affiliations: Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Human Needs, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.

Woolf, MD, MPH, Center on Human Needs, Virginia Commonwealth University, West Hospital, 1200 East Broad St, PO Box 980251, Richmond, VA 23298-0251 ([email protected]). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Health status is determined by more than health care. Education, income, and the neighborhood environment exert great influence on the development of disease--perhaps more than interventions by physicians or hospitals.\\1\\ Consider the role of education. In 2007, adults with a bachelor's degree were four times less likely to report fair or poor health than those without a high school education.\\2\\ The prevalence of diabetes among adults without a high school diploma was 13.2 percent, more than double the prevalence among adults with a bachelor's degree (6.4 percent).\\2\\ In 2008-9, the risk of stroke was 80 percent higher among adults who lacked a high school diploma than among those with some college education.\\3\\ At age 25, life expectancy is at least 5 years longer among college graduates than among those who did not complete high school.\\4\\ Multiple factors explain the health disparity associated with education. Educational attainment is inversely associated with smoking and obesity,\\3\\ but it is also a pathway to better jobs, benefits (including health insurance), and financial security--each of which conveys health advantages. Families with financial insecurity face hardships that often take priority over health concerns. These families tend to eat poorly, forgo exercise, and skip medications to stretch their budget. Low incomes force many to live in unhealthy housing or in struggling or insecure neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods tend to have limited access to medical care, nutritious groceries, and safe places to exercise and an oversupply of fast foods, liquor stores, pollution, and crime.\\5\\ A life of hardships is associated with higher rates of stress and depression.\\2\\ The association between income and health applies to everyone, not just those who are poor. Middle-class individuals have lower life expectancy and worse health status than those who are wealthy.\\4\\ Rich or poor, individuals facing more difficult financial circumstances tend to defer clinical care and allow complications to linger. Disadvantaged patients present to physicians in more advanced stages of disease that are more difficult and costly to treat and are often less survivable.\\6\\ In sum, budget policies that impose financial strain on families or curtail educational opportunities could, in time, cause greater morbidity, mortality, and costs--all of which are problematic on moral and economic grounds. The moral issue is clear: it is unsettling to adopt policies that will induce a higher rate of premature deaths or greater disease or disability. Such policies tend to disproportionately affect those who are poor or who are members of racial or ethnic minority groups, and they often affect children as well. These policies would be soundly rejected if health outcomes and ethics were the only considerations, but policymakers must also contend with economic and political realities. The core argument of fiscal conservatives is that difficult budget decisions and fiscal discipline are necessary for the economy--a worthy principle for many spending areas. However, fiscal discipline loses its logic when spending reductions lead to greater illness and thereby increase health care costs. Any policy that increases disease burden is a threat to the economy because medical spending is so costly to government and employers. Medicare, Medicaid, and children's health insurance consume 23 percent of the Federal budget.\\7\\ Health care costs are complicating efforts to balance State budgets, operate businesses, and compete in the global marketplace. The need to control medical cost inflation is a mounting national priority, one that argues against budgetary policies that would increase morbidity, heighten demand on the system, and drive up medical spending. That unwanted scenario is a potential outcome of the more austere budget cuts under current consideration, many of which would impose economic strain on families, weaken support for education, and allow neighborhood living conditions to become more unhealthy. The effect of these conditions on health, relative to medical care, is often underestimated. According to one estimate, giving every adult the mortality rate of those who attend college would save seven times as many lives as those saved by biomedical advances.\\8\\ It has been estimated that 25 percent of all deaths in Virginia between 1990 and 2006 might not have occurred if the entire population had experienced the mortality rate of those who lived in the State's most affluent counties and cities.\\9\\ In the United States, the adverse socioeconomic conditions that are linked with mortality have become more prevalent in the past decade, especially with the economic recession. Between 2007 and 2009, median household income decreased from $51,965 to $49,777, down from a peak of $52,388 in 1999.\\10\\ Between 2000 and 2009, the number of households with food insecurity increased from 10 million to 17 million.\\10\\ The percentage of individuals with severe housing costs burdens (spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing) increased from 13 percent in 2001 to more than 18 percent in 2009.\\10\\ The number of homeless individuals in families requiring shelters or transitional housing increased from 474,000 in 2007 to 535,000 in 2009.\\10\\ The poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 14.3 percent in 2009, its highest percentage since 1994 and the largest absolute number on record.\\10\\ It is reasonable to predict that the population's exposure to these conditions will eventually result in some increase in the prevalence and severity of major illnesses, a trend that would place greater demands on the health care system. Already, emergency departments and hospitals are noting the recession's effect on admissions for uncontrolled diabetes and heart failure. Lasting effects may take years to document. Many of today's children could endure greater illness decades hence and a shorter life expectancy because they grew up during current conditions. This dismal forecast bears attention from health care leaders, who must prepare capacity plans for the wave of patients that a distressed economy would push into the system, and from politicians and economists, who must consider how that care will be financed by a system already too expensive to sustain. Amid these conditions, it is fair to ask whether now is the right time to cut programs that sustain living conditions for good health and that protect U.S. residents from losing their jobs, income, education, and food. The answer may be disappointing, as the downstream effects on illness and spending may not be enough to outweigh the budgetary pressures of the present, but the question should at least be posed and the tradeoffs discussed. Too often, policymakers and the public fail to recognize the connection between social and health policies, and this seems true again as proponents and critics of current budget reforms wage their debate. When policies could claim lives, exacerbate illnesses, and worsen the economic crisis, these ramifications should at least be discussed.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Sanders. Thank you very much, Dr. Woolf. Senator Warren, did you want to introduce Dr. Berkman? Senator Warren. I do, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. It is my honor to introduce Dr. Lisa Berkman, the Thomas Cabot Professor of Public Policy and Epidemiology, and the director of the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Berkman is a social epidemiologist who examines the impact of social and policy factors on health outcomes. Dr. Berkman began her career at Northwestern University, where she received her bachelor's in sociology, later attended the University of California Berkeley where she earned both her master's and her doctorate in epidemiology. Before joining the faculty at Harvard, she spent 16 years as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Berkman's research, both in America and internationally, has helped us better understand the role that social inequality plays in people's health. She has authored or co-authored 275 publications in peer-reviewed literature and numerous book chapters, and is a member of the Institute of Medicine. I am so pleased that Dr. Berkman is with us here today, and I am looking forward to an engaging conversation with her. Senator Sanders. Dr. Berkman, thanks very much for being here. Please begin. STATEMENT OF LISA BERKMAN, Ph.D., DIRECTOR OF THE HARVARD CENTER FOR POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AND THOMAS D. CABOT PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, CAMBRIDGE, MA Ms. Berkman. Chairman Sanders, Senator Warren, Senator Baldwin, and other members of the committee, thank you for this invitation to testify. You have chosen a very provocative title for this hearing. It calls for a straightforward response that outlines more than the situation, but also includes potential solutions. First, I am going to describe, very briefly, trends in life expectancy and the unequal distribution of lists of death by socioeconomic status in the United States, then I will go to some practical options for improving the Nation's health. I will focus on work policy particularly here because it is an area in which the Federal and State Governments have a role in shaping policies that would reduce health disparities. First, as we have said, U.S. life expectancy has lost ground compared to other Nations in the last decades, especially for women. I was a member of the National Academy of Science's panel on longevity trends. It found that the United States ranked at the bottom of 21 industrialized, developed Nations. These low rankings are particularly striking for the poor and for women. Of most concern is the widening gap and the risk of death between those at the bottom and those at the top. This gap has widened over the past 25 years. For instance, in 2007, the death rate for men without a high school education was 7 per 100; it was 2 per 100 for those with a college education. This corresponds to a 3\\1/2\\-fold increased risk for those less- educated men. This risk has grown substantially over the last 25 years. Among women, the patterns are even more troubling. For less-educated women, the risk of dying actually increased, as you noted, in absolute terms during this time. Most striking, this pattern holds even if we only look at white women in the United States. Now, using the public health framework, I want to show how labor policies and practices can make a difference in American's health. Although health insurance and access to medical care can help reduce risks of financial catastrophe, and also help cure disease once it occurs, healthcare alone cannot prevent disease. It is like aspirin and headaches. Aspirin can cure headaches, but headaches are not caused by lack of aspirin; they are not aspirin deficiency diseases. To reduce headaches, we need to focus on the cause of the headache. For this same reason, we need to look at what causes these high rates of dying among the poor and less-educated. So turning to work, then. A number of studies on the relationship between work and health show that employment almost always associates with better health. These associations last well into old age and relates to reduced mortality risk, as well as to the maintenance of cognitive and physical functioning. Here are three specific work-related policies that promise to improve health, especially for low wage earners and their families. No. 1, the Earned Income Tax Credit program. EITC is associated with improvement in infant health and decreases in smoking among mothers. Getting the EITC means that your baby, on average, will be 16 grams heavier. To put that in context, it is equal to about one-third of the association between birth weight and having a mother with a high school degree. EITC reduces the odds of maternal smoking by 5 percent and increases mother's odds of working and increases her wages. No. 2, recent evidence on maternity leave policies in the United States and Europe suggests that protecting employment among expectant and recent mothers leads to better long-term labor-market outcomes including wage level and growth, career prospects, labor market attachment, and employability. Mounting evidence suggests maternity leave is health-promoting for infants and for their mothers throughout their lives. No. 3, work-family practices. In a study that we did of employees in long term care facilities--which is primarily a low wage working group in a very highly regulated industry--we found that when managers were attentive to work-family issues, their employees were half as likely to have cardiovascular risks compared to workers who have less family friendly bosses. Specifically, these employees were less likely to be overweight, they have lower blood pressure, lower diabetes. The health effects that I have described here are not counted in the current cost benefit metrics of these policies, so we dramatically underestimate the real benefits that they have. Our labor policies challenge working-class families to remain simultaneously committed to work and to family. Over half of low-wage earners lack sick leave to take care of family. I could give you more policies that would help the health of our low-income working families, but I will stop here. The EITC, pro-family work policies and practices, and parental leave are just three examples of policies that impact the health of low-income working families. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Berkman follows:] Prepared Statement of Lisa F. Berkman, Ph.D. Chairman Sanders, Senator Burr and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to testify. I will discuss two issues today. First, I will describe trends in U.S. life expectancy and the unequal distribution of mortality risk by socioeconomic status in the United States. Second, I will elaborate on options for improving the Nation's health, especially related to labor policies for low-wage workers. I will frame our options for improving health in terms of what we can do to create a healthy population and prevent disease. First, U.S. overall life expectancy--that is the expected number of years someone born today can expect to live--has lost ground compared to that of other nations in the last decades, especially for women. I was a member of a recent National Academy of Science Panel on diverging trends in longevity. It found that the United States ranked at the bottom of 21 developed, industrialized nations \\1\\ and poor rankings were particularly striking for women. In the 1980s our rankings were in the middle of OECD countries in this study. While it is true that LE improved during this time from by 5.6 years for men and 3.6 years for women, other countries gained substantially more in terms of life expectancy, leaving us behind. Furthermore, almost all those gains were concentrated among the most socioeconomically advantaged segments of the U.S. population. And they were more substantial for men than for women. The poorest Americans experienced the greatest health disadvantage compared to those in other countries.\\2\\ \\3\\ At a recent NIH conference, the discussion was focused on the steps required for the United States to reach just the OECD average in the next 20 years-- not even the top. It seems we have given up on achieving better than average health. More concerning is the widening gap in mortality--or risk of death--between those at the bottom and at the top in the United States. These gaps have widened over the last 25 years. These patterns are evident whether we look at education, income or wealth differentials, but because the evidence is clearest that education itself is causally linked to health and functioning.\\4\\ \\5\\ I will focus on these associations. For instance, the mortality for men with less than a high school education in 2007, was about 7 per 100. For those with 16 years or more of education, the rate was less than 2 per 100. This corresponds to a 3\\1/2\\-fold risk of dying in 2007, compared to 2.5 times the risk in 1993. For less-educated women, their mortality risk actually increased absolutely during this time giving rise to an increased risk from 1.9 to 3 in 2007 \\6\\ and this pattern holds even if we confine our analyses to white women.\\7\\ While it is true that fewer adults are in the less-educated pool in later years, giving rise to questions about selection issues, it is also true that adults in the highest educated categories have grown over this same time suggesting increased compositional heterogeneity in these groups. Overall while selection into education level occurs, it accounts for only a small part of this widening gap. While mortality gaps in socioeconomic status have existed for centuries, the magnitude of these differences has grown substantially over time in the United States. These widening disparities suggest that either disparities in the underlying determinants of illness and mortality have also been growing over time or that support to buffer these stressful conditions has changed. In either case, while we may not be able to eliminate health disparities, the fact that the size of the risks varies so much suggests that such large inequalities are not inevitable or innate and, gives hope that there are ways to reduce the burden of illness for our most vulnerable citizens. Now, using a public health framework, I discuss the identification of health risks. While health insurance and access to medical care help reduce risks of financial catastrophe and can improve the health of those suffering from illness, health care alone cannot ensure good health and prevent the onset of disease. To illustrate this point, we can think of the aspirin/headache analogy. ``While Aspirin cures a headache, lack of aspirin is not the cause of headaches.'' Headaches are not caused by aspirin deficiency--to reduce headaches we need to focus on what causes headaches. This is what prevention and public health approaches offer. Obviously it would be better to maintain health than have to treat illness once it occurs. Treatments are financially very costly, but more importantly, waiting to treat disease is costly to the quality of lives of all Americans. What would be required to produce better health among Americans and reduce socioeconomic disparities in health? What do poor socioeconomic conditions influence that could cause such increased risk across such a huge number of diseases across all age groups from the infancy to old age? You are all probably thinking about the usual suspects--smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise. I'm not going to focus on these usual suspects today, not because I don't believe they pose substantial risks to health, but because we know that it is very hard to change these behaviors without considering the social and economic conditions that shape them. These social and economic conditions are fundamental determinants of health because they influence so many behaviors and access to so many opportunities and resources. Change here will influence a number of channels leading to increased mortality risk. In my testimony I will focus on one of these conditions relating to participation in the labor market. Several years ago, I embarked on a study to assess the relationships between employment, family dynamics and health. We found that employment was almost always associated with better health. These associations lasted well into old age. Women who had the lowest mortality risk in later adulthood had spent some time out of the labor market (a few years over the career path) but maintain steady labor force participation for most of their lives until retirement. Drawing on data from the Health and Retirement Study, we find that among married mothers, those who never worked had an age-standardized mortality rate of 52.\\6\\ whereas mothers who took some time off when their children were young but who later joined the workforce and mortality rates of around 40. Single mothers who never worked had the highest mortality of 98 compared to 68 for single mothers who worked. Selection into the labor force may account for some of this association, but more experimental evidence confirms the positive health benefits of working especially for low-income women and men. For example, the EITC is associated with improvements in infant health and decreases in smoking among mothers.\\8\\ In an analysis of State variation in the Earned Income Tax Credits (EITCs) between 1980 and 2002, Strully finds that EITC's increase birth weights by, on average, 16 grams. To put that in context, it is equal to about a third of the association between birth weight and having a mother with a high school degree. Living in State with EITC reduces the odds of maternal smoking by 5 percent, and increases mother's odds of working and increases her wages and salary. Recent evidence from several studies of maternity leave policies in the United States and Europe suggests that, by protecting employment among mothers in the period around birth, maternity leave leads to better long-term labor market outcomes after maternity including wage level and growth, career prospects, labor market attachment and employability.\\9\\ \\10\\ \\11\\ \\12\\ Thus not only may maternity leave benefit children and mothers around the period of birth, they may have long-term benefits for mothers that extend for decades in later adulthood. In an observational study of employees in long-term care facilities, we found that workers whose managers were attentive to work-family issues had half the cardiovascular risks as assessed by objective biomarkers from blood or clinical exam and healthier patterns of sleep compared to those who worked for less family-friendly managers.\\13\\ Specifically, employees whose managers maintained family- friendly practices were less likely to be overweight, had lower risk of diabetes and lower blood pressure. Based on objective measures of sleep using actigraphy monitors, these same employees slept almost 30 minutes more per night than their counterparts. For nurses and certified nursing assistants in low- and middle-wage jobs, these are important risks to which they were exposed. Such research suggests that labor policies and practices that support men and women in the labor force and especially help those with caregiving obligations are health promoting. These policies and practices have health effects that are not often ``counted'' as we think about their costs and benefits. Men and women will need opportunities and flexibility and schedule control to enter and remain in the labor force given the inevitability of having to care for children, parents, or partners at some point in time. Our goal for women should be to enable them to be successful in their productive as well as reproductive lives. Right now, we make this very difficult. Our labor policies challenge working class families to remain committed to work and to their families. For example, over half (54 percent) of low- wage earners lack sick leave or vacation to take care of families and around 30 percent of middle-income families lack such leave.\\14\\ Even fewer have parental leave. We have shown that we can identify the socioeconomic disparities in health with some precision. Solutions that help to maintain low- and working-class men and women in the paid labor force have clear health benefits. The EITC, pro-family work policies and practices and parental leave are examples of polices that impact health of low-income working families. Targets enabling adults to participate in the paid labor force while not risking the health and well-being of their family members show particular value. Metrics for evaluating social and economic policies do not currently include health metrics. The health spillovers of such policies would increase the benefits of such policies in any cost-benefit equations. We want to ensure that Americans, particularly those living in poverty and working-class families aren't robbed of healthy years of life. References 1.

He researches and writes extensively on economic development, foreign aid, global health, demographics, and poverty. Dr. Eberstadt, thanks very much for being with us. STATEMENT OF NICHOLAS EBERSTADT, Ph.D., MPA, M.Sc., HENRY WENDT CHAIR IN POLITICAL ECONOMY, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Eberstadt. Mr. Chairman, Senators Warren, Baldwin, distinguished co-panelists, and guests. It is an honor to be here. My testimony focuses upon the exceptions to the established generalization that better education, better health access, and better income result in better health outcomes. Nobody disputes this, but the predictive power of those generalizations should be appreciated, because it is limited. In my testimony, I show a number of tables which make this argument more clearly than perhaps one can in a brief period of time. If we look at Table 1 in my testimony, I show poverty rates, percentages of adults without high school degrees, GINI coefficients, percentages with no health insurance, and age- adjusted percentages of adults 18 or over with no healthcare visits in the previous 12 months for non-Hispanic whites, also known as Anglos, for Asian Pacific Americans, for Black non- Hispanic African-Americans, for Hispanics, and for the country as a whole. Now what you will see in this chart is that by all of these indicators, by far the most advantaged group in the United States are the Anglos, lower poverty rates, lower percentages of adults without high school education, lower GINI coefficients for family income, lower percentages without health insurance, and lower percentages who have never been to a doctor or another professional in the last 12 months. One would think on the basis of what we know that these Anglos would have better than average mortality for the United States as a whole. They do not. In fact, their mortality level, age standardized, is slightly worse than the Nation as a whole. If one takes a look at the group which seems to be most disadvantaged by these metrics, which would be Latinos, their age standardized mortality is not higher than the national average. In fact, it is 25 percent lower. We should want to understand why this paradox occurs. If we look at Figure 5 in my testimony, which shows life expectancy in the County of Los Angeles, America's largest, most populous county, the most privileged group in terms of poverty rate would be the non-Hispanic whites. Latinos have a poverty rate which is over twice as high as the Anglos in Los Angeles County, yet the life expectancy at birth for Latinos in Las Angeles is almost 2\\1/2\\ years higher than for whites. We should want to understand how this sort of an outcome can occur. In Figure 8 in my testimony, I use an analysis, or I present an analysis, done by the New York City Department of Health which shows life expectancy by ethnicity and by poverty statuses, neighborhoods. One of the fascinating results here, for Asian-Americans, the poverty status of neighborhoods makes practically no difference in life expectancy, and life expectancy for Asian-Americans in New York City is higher than for any other group. We should want to know how that can be. Finally, Figures 11 and 12, I take estimates made by the Social Science Research Council in New York City for life expectancy by ethnicity by State across the United States, and I compare these with life expectancy as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau for various OECD countries. You can see in Figure 11 that for Hispanic Americans taken by themselves, life expectancy at birth is higher than for any OECD country. The healthiest country in the world at this point is Japan. Latino life expectancy in America is higher than life expectancy in Japan. And the figures for Asian-Americans are just off the charts. If the United States was a nation of only Latinos and Asian-Americans, disadvantaged groups by these indicators I used, we would be the healthiest country on earth. A question for us, it seems to me, a critical question is: how do some disadvantaged groups achieve excellent, world-class health outcomes? If we answer that question, I think we can help to increase health for all Americans. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Eberstadt follows:] Prepared Statement of Nicholas Eberstadt, Ph.D., MPA, M.Sc. Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members, esteemed co-panelists and guests, in these august chambers, as in other policymaking circles in Washington and around the Nation, a policy syllogism is gaining currency and receiving increasingly respectful attention. The syllogism runs something like this: health progress is faltering in America today; faltering health progress is the consequence of social and economic disparities; therefore government must intervene to reduce disparities if health progress is to be revitalized. Influential as this syllogism has come to be nowadays, I submit that it is empirically flawed, and therefore requires serious qualification and re-examination. The problem with the syllogism lies not in its assertion that health progress in modern America is disappointing. For the Nation as a whole, the evidence to this effect is, unfortunately, overwhelming. Rather, the trouble lies with the proposition that social and economic disparities are the cause of America's disappointing health performance today. To be clear: this is not to ignore the great corpus of data pointing to a widening of income differences and other economic differences in America over the past generation. Nor is it to suggest that it is not better to be affluent, educated, and well-insured. Obviously it is: and not just for reasons bearing on health. Yet the perhaps curious fact of the matter is that real existing social and economic disparities are just not that good in predicting real existing health disparities in our real existing modern America. In fact, it is commonplace today for poorer, less-educated groups to enjoy substantially *better* health outcomes than those who would appear to enjoy distinctly greater socioeconomic advantages. The surprising--but also hopeful--fact is that it is possible for groups suffering what might be described as both social and economic disadvantage to achieve very good health outcomes in America today. And that is not just a technical, arcane, theoretical possibility: it is a main street reality, ratified by the survival profiles of millions upon millions of Americans today. We manifestly need to understand exactly how it is that so many Americans today manage to achieve good or excellent health outcomes with limited incomes, educational backgrounds, and other socioeconomic resources. But manifestly, the mental straitjacket that the ``social disparities'' mindset imposes on public health research is incapable of helping us in this critical task. The tables and graphs that accompany this written statement offer data and analysis that underscore, and expand upon, the summary points offered telegraphically in the preceding paragraphs. Let us begin with the question of America's health record over the postwar era. There is really no question at this point as to the at- best mediocre results we as a society have garnered over the past half century and more. While our country has achieved continuing incremental improvements in overall health conditions (as reflected in the mirror of mortality), our progress has been decidedly slower than in other affluent Western democracies--and thus our ranking in this roster has gradually but steadily declined. We can see this in Figures 1 and 2 of the attachment to this written statement. [See Figures 1 and 2] The graphics trace out the trends in years of combined male and female life expectancy at birth on the one hand, and infant mortality rates per thousand live births on the other hand, for the United States and 23 other never-communist members of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), an association of aid-dispensing Western industrialized democracies. These estimates come from the Human Mortality Data base, a project undertaken by the University of California at Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany--since experts in this network have carefully examined the underlying data from all these countries and offered their own corrections or reconstructions as warranted, we get an ``apples to apples'' comparison here. As can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, despite continuing progress in reducing mortality levels, America has gone from a more or less middling ranking in this pack of 24 countries shortly after the end of World War II (1950) to the very poorest ranking among these 24 countries today (circa 2010). Life expectancy at birth is now estimated by the Human Mortality Database researchers to be lower in the USA than in any of the other 23 comparators--and infant mortality conversely is placed highest in the USA for any country in this same group. Trend lines for the odds of surviving from birth to say age 65, or any other measure for the risk of premature mortality, would tell a roughly similar story for America's health performance over the postwar era. What accounts for this long-term relative decline in U.S. health performance? Over the past half century, America has become an increasingly multiethnic society, and it has also seen the emergence of growing economic differences. (Admittedly, rising measured economic differences have also been characteristic of almost all other affluent Western democracies over these same decades--but measured income dispersion in the USA today appears to be greater than in almost all of the comparator countries in Figures 1 and 2). It is tempting to link these big changes in American society and economy with our disappointing health performance. This impulse, indeed, is at the heart of the current popularity of the ``social disparities'' paradigm, so widely utilized in public health research on America today. There is no gainsaying the general insight that more prosperous and better-educated people should be expected to have more favorable health outcomes than those who are less well-to-do. But as a practical matter, socioeconomic disparities do not seem to offer us all that much help in understanding the big health differentials we see in our society today. Table 1 makes the point. [See Table 1] It presents figures for America's major ethnic groups on the one hand for major indices of social and economic disparity--poverty rates; proportions of the adult population without high school education; income distribution for families; percentages of persons without health insurance; percentages of adults with no health care visits over the previous 12 months--and on the other for age-standardized mortality. If the ``social disparities'' model has much predictive power in the modern American context, we would expect these major disparities to track with differential in mortality. We should bear this in mind when"
