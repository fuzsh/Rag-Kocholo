        "text": "Jerry Kopel, a Denver Democrat, served 22 years in the Colorado House of Representatives.\n\nOne is the 53rd speaker of the House, and the other is the 46th president of the Senate.\n\nThis past week, marked adjournment of the second regular session of the 66th Colorado General Assembly. Unless there is a special session later this year, this will be the last time for House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and Senate President Peter Groff, both of Denver, to preside over their respective branches of the Legislature.\n\nRomanoff's tenure, aside from the likely plaudits, differs from most of his predecessors. He is only the ninth Colorado House speaker to have served more than two years in that office.\n\nBased on what has happened from 1941 on, most people would believe the House has always been run by a few who held office for long periods. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nFrom 1876 through 1940, only one House speaker served more than two years. He was Thomas Stuart, from 1885 to 1888.\n\nFifty-two of the 53 speakers were white males, Lola Spradley of Pueblo County in 2003-04 being the exception. Speaker Romanoff was not the first speaker of Jewish faith to serve. That honor goes to Ben Bezoff, a journalist of some renown who was elected majority leader for the 1949-50 session.\n\nHouse Speaker Pat Magill Jr. died in 1949 and Bezoff was elected speaker for the 1950 special session, which lasted six days in August and passed six of eight bills introduced. Technically, Bezoff remained speaker until the first day of the 1951 session, but the previous fall he won election to the state Senate.\n\nFrom 1941 through 2008, there were eight speakers who served more than two years - a total of 48 years among the eight in 68 years.\n\nAt the top of the heap was Carl \"Bev\" Bledsoe, speaker from 1981-90, followed by Chuck Berry from 1991-1998. Three served six years each - Homer Pearson, 1941-46, David Hamil, 1951-56, John Vanderhoof, 1963-64 and 1967-1970.\n\nAnother three served four years each - Charles Conklin, 1957-60, John Fuhr, 1971-74, and Romanoff, 2005-08. Only two - Conklin and Romanoff - of the nine longer-term speakers were Democrats.\n\nEvery House speaker from 1876to 1900 was a Republican or Silver Republican (Silver meaning use of silver along with the gold standard as backup for money). From 1876 to 2008, there have been 35 Republican and 18 Democratic speakers.\n\nThe presidency of the Colorado Senate is more of an evolutionary sideshow. The state's original constitution gave the task to the lieutenant governor, who might or might not be of the same political party as the governor.\n\nA hairy story: From 1876 to 1916, the winners were almost always bearded or walrus mustached and sometimes both. No one could see their upper lip. There were two exceptions, Warren Haggott in 1903-04, and Erastus Harper in 1907-08.\n\nFollowing the 1916 election, none of the Senate presidents wore facial hair - not until that Fu Manchu version under the nose of Peter Groff.\n\nOf the first 18 Senate presidents, 14 were Republican, two were Populists and two were Democrats.\n\nTwo-year terms lasted until the 1958 election when the term for lieutenant governor became four years. Robert Knous served two terms from 1958-1966 before losing a bid to become governor to Republican John Love. From 1970 on, the governor and lieutenant governor ran on the same ticket.\n\nSince 1975, the lieutenant governor no longer has doubled as president of the Senate. A state senator now is elected by his peers to that position, beginning with Fred Anderson from 1975 to 1982. He was followed by Ted Strickland from 1983 to 1992. Next came Tom Norton from 1993 to 1998.\n\nThen, we were back to two-year terms for Ray Powers, Stan Matsunaka and John Andrews, followed by three years for Joan Fitz-Gerald, and presently in 2008 with Peter Groff as the 46th president of the Senate.\n\nOf all Colorado Senate presidents, the first 44 were white males - followed by one white female (Fitz-Gerald) and one black male (Groff)."
