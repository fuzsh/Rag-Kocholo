        "text": "Asbestos in U.S. Navy Ships\n\nBetween 1940 and the 1970s, the U.S. Navy used over 300 different asbestos products on their ships. Asbestos could be found throughout the ships, including in the engine and boiler rooms, pump rooms, mess halls and living quarters.\n\nBecause of its widespread usage, everyone on board was at risk of coming into contact with asbestos fibers.\n\nOn U.S. naval ships, parts that contained asbestos include:\n\nAdhesives\n\nBoilers, boiler linings and heat shields\n\nCables\n\nCaulk\n\nCeiling and floor tiles\n\nDeck coverings\n\nElectrical coating\n\nEngines\n\nGaskets and valves\n\nGrinders\n\nInsulation\n\nLagging and rope\n\nLinings of steel wall plates and doors\n\nMeters\n\nPacking\n\nPaint\n\nPaneling\n\nPipes, pipe insulation and pipe coverings\n\nPumps\n\nThermal insulation\n\nTubing\n\nTurbines\n\nThe extensive use of asbestos on U.S. Navy ships posed a significant health risk to service members — a risk that asbestos companies worked to keep hidden from the military and public for decades.\n\nU.S. Navy veterans with mesothelioma and their loved ones may be able to file a mesothelioma claim and pursue compensation with the help of our asbestos attorneys.\n\nMesothelioma compensation can help pay for medical and travel costs, daily living expenses and whatever else the client wishes.\n\nIf you were diagnosed with mesothelioma, you may be able to access compensation from:\n\nAsbestos Trust Funds: Asbestos companies that filed for bankruptcy were ordered to put aside money in trust funds for future mesothelioma patients. Today, there is an estimated $30 billion in these trusts.\n\nMesothelioma Lawsuits: Lawsuits hold asbestos companies accountable and may result in a settlement or verdict. Since 1999, we’ve recovered over $9.6 billion for our clients.\n\nVA Benefits: Our VA-accredited lawyers can help U.S. Navy veterans prepare their VA claims to access monthly payments and health care benefits.\n\nMesothelioma claims are filed against the companies that produced or distributed the asbestos products you were exposed to while working on U.S. Navy ships.\n\nWe don’t take legal action against the U.S. Navy or the government.\n\nIn 1953, Walter proudly joined the U.S. Navy. He spent the next 20 years working as a boilerman before retiring to build a homestead in Washington.\n\nUnfortunately, Walter’s days of gardening and hunting were cut short by a pleural mesothelioma diagnosis. Walter had been exposed to asbestos fibers during his time in the U.S. Navy, which caused him to become ill decades later.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, Walter’s friend connected him with Simmons Hanly Conroy. Walter wanted to take action against the asbestos companies responsible for his exposure. Just a few days later, he had an entire legal team working on his behalf."
