        "text": "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has appointed the deputy chief of staff of the lieutenant governor to the Colorado Chemical Demilitarization Citizens’ Advisory Commission.\n\n“I am honored to serve on the CAC,” said Mark Honnen. “The CAC ensures that community interests and perspectives are present throughout each stage of this critical project. Having the community voice represented helps guarantee that local interests and safety concerns are properly accounted for throughout the project. It also helps maintain the critical civil-military relationships vital to our national security.”\n\nHonnen, who has served as the deputy chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Dianne Primavera since Oct. 2019, served in the U.S. Air Force for nine years. Prior to joining Primavera’s staff, Honnen was an assistant professor of history at the U.S. Air Force Academy for six years. Honnen is a Colorado native, having received his commission through Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps at the University of Colorado.\n\n“As an Air Force veteran, I am especially humbled to be on the CAC during the final phases of the project, ensuring a safe and expeditious completion of the chemical stockpile destruction,” said Honnen.\n\nThe Colorado Chemical Demilitarization Citizens’ Advisory Commission is a nine-member body that serves as a bridge between the community and the government by providing a forum for exchanging information on chemical weapons, offering opportunities for public involvement, and representing community and state interests to the Army and Department of Defense. The Colorado advisory commission meets on a monthly basis with Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant representatives and other government officials."
