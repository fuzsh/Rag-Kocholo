        "text": "DENVER — A new Colorado lieutenant governor taking the oath of office Thursday says that efficiency will be her top job.\n\nDemocrat Donna Lynne is replacing former Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia, who left office to run a higher-education group.\n\nLynne is a former health care executive who was tapped by Gov. John Hickenlooper. Her plans for the next couple years are to try to make state government more efficient.\n\nFor example, Lynne has talked to lawmakers about writing a state budget every other year, rather than every year. She says that is more similar to how a private corporation projects spending.\n\nLynne has said she has no plans to run for the governor's office herself after Hickenlooper leaves office in 2019."
