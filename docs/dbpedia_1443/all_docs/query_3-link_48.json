The workforce has changed profoundly over the past few years, but the fact remains: Despite investing a lot of money and conducting a lot of surveys, few organizations have made real progress in activating engagement. Disengaged employees still cost the U.S. a whopping $550 billion each year.\n\nIn the first part of our energizing opening session, behavioral economics expert Jeff Kreisler explores the promising potential of behavioral science—which draws from psychology, sociology, and economics to shed light on human behavior—to drive employee engagement. Could this fascinating field hold the key to unlocking a long-elusive metric?\n\nThen, WorldatWork CEO Scott Cawood kicks off an electrifying conversation with soccer legend and pay-equity champion Megan Rapinoe! They’ll discuss leading through transformational times, including how to build resilient teams, drive real results, and strive for equity.

Together they will explore how AI is already seriously disrupting the work of compensation teams by automating data, analysis, job architecture and communications. Yet the aspirations of Tech visionaries may be missing critical factors, especially those relating to people – both those who staff the compensation function and the broader employee population. Sumser and Gorman will seek to disentangle hype from reality in a debate that promises to be provocative and action-packed. Using Salary.com’s recently published “Attributes of a World-Class Compensation Function” as a framework, the duo will present a point-counterpoint discussion about the realities of AI in compensation. You won’t want to miss this lively, entertaining, and informative debate.\n\nSponsored by Salary.com\n\nOptional Pre-Work: Please complete this optional pre-work by Sunday May 19 at 5PM. https://forms.office.com/r/VvmFgnz4mx\n\nA simple Chat GPT tool can put you on the road to more effectively managing medical leaves and accommodations in the workplace.

In today’s fast-paced, always-connected world, individuals are facing increasing demands and pressures, making them more susceptible to burnout. Factors like remote work, extended work hours, and blurred boundaries have contributed to this issue.\n\nCommon signs of burnout include persistent fatigue, a sense of cynicism or detachment from work, reduced productivity, and even physical symptoms like headaches and sleep disturbances. Recognizing these signs early can help individuals take proactive steps to address burnout.\n\nIt’s essential for both individuals and organizations to address burnout. Individuals should prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and seek social support. Organizations should promote a healthy work culture, encourage work-life balance, and provide resources like employee assistance programs. Recognizing and tackling burnout requires a multi-faceted approach.\n\nAre you concerned that AI and evolving technology will make the jobs of tomorrow less human?

With the EU Directive on Pay Transparency and Equity upping the game for multinational organizations, this session is designed to be a catalyst for change, empowering you to take decisive action and position your organization for success.\n\nWe will address the unique challenges faced by global organizations as they navigate diverse pay equity and transparency legislation around the globe. Explore the contrasting approaches of a global shared vision for transparency versus local compliance-focused strategies and discover the actions companies are taking to prepare for this paradigm shift, and ultimately, explore how these changes will disrupt long-held norms around how compensation is managed. Our expert facilitators, with extensive experience in pay transparency and equity strategies, will share insights and trends from Mercer's research and client experiences.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUnderstand the challenges and implications of diverse pay equity and transparency legislation for global organizations.\n\nAcquire valuable insights, trends, and innovative practices to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nSponsored by Mercer\n\nToday, 60% of organizations now publish salary ranges when advertising jobs. This marks a fifteen-percentage point increase from the 45% who said that they did so in 2023. While this represents a marked improvement in pay transparency for job postings, it does not represent pay transparency across an organization. Pay philosophy, processes, outcomes, and communications all require organizations to assess the level of transparency they're willing to embark on.\n\nMany organizations have embraced pay transparency in recruiting due to changing legislation, but still fail to foster transparency with an incumbent workforce. Failing to bring the incumbent workforce along this pay transparency journey can degrade employee trust, engagement, and productivity. They’re “transparent” and yet failing to experience the benefits of attracting and retaining the best talent. Moreover, in the current economic landscape, many compensation and rewards professionals are faced with a challenge set by leadership to take their transparency efforts further: “Pay transparency shouldn't cost us money.”\n\nBut it's bound to cost something, right?\n\nIn this roundtable, Lulu Seikaly and Ruth Thomas will outline the myriad costs of a failure to address pay transparency fully — engagement implications, social implications, legal implications, or otherwise. This discussion will equip compensation leaders to be strategic partners to their HR and executive teams and identify the types of cost their organization should be prepared for as legislation and employee sentiment continues to evolve.\n\nSponsored by Payscale\n\nIn today's competitive business landscape, nurturing a positive employee experience is paramount for organizational success. This highly-interactive roundtable discussion brings together HR leaders, managers, and experts to delve into strategies for enhancing employee experience through effective recognition, engaging managers, and fostering meaningful connections within the workplace.\n\nKey Discussion Points:\n\nEmployee Experience in Focus: Understanding the holistic concept of employee experience and its impact on organizational performance. How can organizations create a conducive environment that prioritizes employee well-being, growth, and satisfaction?\n\nThe Power of Recognition: Exploring the significance of employee recognition in driving motivation, productivity, and retention. What are the best practices for designing and implementing recognition programs that resonate with diverse workforce demographics and organizational cultures?\n\nEngaging Managers as Key Enablers: Recognizing the pivotal role of managers in shaping employee experience. How can organizations empower and support managers to effectively engage with their teams, provide constructive feedback, and foster a culture of trust and collaboration?\n\nBuilding Meaningful Connections: Emphasizing the importance of fostering connections and building a sense of belonging among employees. What strategies can organizations employ to facilitate peer-to-peer interactions, mentorship opportunities, and cross-functional collaboration?\n\nMeasuring Success: Identifying metrics and tools to evaluate the effectiveness of employee experience initiatives.

No matter what industry you’re operating in you’re going to be always dealing with change. Technological advances and culture shifts lead people to find improvements and discover new, often better ways of doing things. So it should be no surprise that companies should be always looking for ways to optimize their total rewards package.\n\nFrom transformative technology to the ever-changing regulatory landscape and plan design enhancements, this roundtable sets out to highlight what trends are most impactful in today’s climate.\n\nOur discussion will consider the evolution of AI and its seemingly limitless potential and how innovative technologies and gamification can boost interactive learning. We will look, not only at the benefits of implementing such technologies, but also at their associated risks too.\n\nThe importance placed on financial wellness by companies continues to grow, and we will explore solutions such as local customization for global plans, targeted communication and nurture journeys that can support the audience in optimizing employee literacy when it comes to their total rewards packages.\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint the past year has seen many changes being introduced in the U.S., with more signposted to follow, and this session will serve as an opportunity to hear about compliance best practices for both new and incoming State legislations.\n\nChris Dohrmann, Executive Director, Global Shares, a J.P. Morgan company, will facilitate an insightful conversation to explore how these trends can affect your total rewards package and help with empowering employee prosperity. The audience will have the opportunity to hear stories from industry peers who have navigated challenges similar to those currently being faced or which attendees may come across in the future.\n\nSponsored by J.P.
