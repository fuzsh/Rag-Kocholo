In 1908 he retired on account of ill health. He died in Helena in 1929.\n\nIn 1864 Sidney Edgerton became Montana's first territorial governor. Political turbulence—due in large part to Civil War era animosities—marked the new territory, which saw three governors and two acting governors in its first six years of existence. By 1870, Montana's non-Indian population numbered 20,595. That year President Ulysses S. Grant appointed moderate Republican Benjamin Potts as governor. Potts successfully stabilized Montana politics, focusing on fiscal responsibility and economic development during his thirteen-year term. When Potts left office in 1883, Montanans were united in their desire for statehood; however, five more territorial governors would govern Montana before the territory finally became a state in 1889."
