Governor Will Ainsworth concluded his term as ASA National Chair.\n\nLt. Governor Primavera has been working to advance the aerospace ecosystem in Colorado since day one having served this past year as the Vice Chair of the ASA and the co-chair of the Colorado Space Coalition. Under the Polis-Primavera administration, Colorado has the largest aerospace economy per capita in the country and a number of aerospace companies have expanded in Colorado.\n\n“I am honored to accept this role and to help expand the aerospace industry, both in Colorado and throughout the country. Colorado is a proud epicenter of aerospace. As this critical industry continues to grow in our state, bringing good-paying jobs and helping to build an economy for all, I am excited to continue our successful work fostering an innovative and collaborative ecosystem for the aerospace industry that can be a model for the rest of the nation,” said Lieutenant Governor Primavera."
