        "text": "Americans for the Arts and the National Lieutenant Governors Association (NLGA) are honored to present Alaska Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer with the 2022 Public Leadership in the Arts Award for State Arts Leadership. The annual award honors a public official who has demonstrated outstanding leadership in the advancement of the arts at the state/territory level.\n\nLt. Gov. Meyer has been a champion of the arts throughout his career in public service, supporting artistic and cultural activity for Alaskans. He was integral to the survival of the Alaska State Council on the Arts (ASCA) when funding for the agency was vetoed, insistent on the reinstatement of its budget, which reversed the effective elimination of the agency. Since that time, Lt. Gov. Meyer has continued to show a deep awareness of the intrinsic, educational, and economic benefits of the arts, and the crucial role that public investment plays in making the arts successful and vibrant.\n\nThrough his work with the NLGA, Lt. Gov. Meyer has offered his support to organize and host an Alaska State Military and Veterans Arts Initiative in conjunction with Americans for the Arts and the Alaska State Council on the Arts. This initiative will not only conduct a field survey of arts groups that are providing services to military members and veterans, but also will create a database where this information is readily available to Alaskans and other service providers.\n\nUpon assuming statewide office as lieutenant governor in 2018, Lt. Gov. Meyer retired from ConocoPhillips where he had worked for 39 years as a supply chain coordinator, and for Conoco’s predecessor ARCO. He served eight years on the Anchorage Assembly, eight years in the Alaska House of Representatives, ten years in the Alaska Senate, and occupied a number of key leadership positions in the Alaska Legislature, including Co-Chair of the House and Senate Finance Committees, Senate Majority Leader, Senate Rules Chairman, and Senate President.\n\nNolen V. Bivens, president and CEO of Americans for the Arts, commented, “Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer’s support for the arts and investment in arts programs and activities has demonstrably improved Alaskans’ lives. He truly understands the inherent value of the arts and the positive benefits they have on society, the economy, health, and our overall wellbeing. I congratulate Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer – he is a true champion for the arts in Alaska.”\n\nAlaska State Council on the Arts Chairman Benjamin Brown said, “Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer has shown consistently strong support for the arts throughout his decades of public service in Alaska in many different capacities as an elected official. He really understands how important the arts are in helping Alaskans live life to the fullest, opening minds, expanding economic opportunity, sharing, and celebrating diverse cultures, and bringing people together to learn from one another. I am delighted that he is receiving this well-deserved Public Leadership in the Arts Award for State Arts Leadership.”\n\nAmericans for the Arts and the NLGA have jointly presented the Public Leadership in the Arts Award for State Arts Leadership since 2006."
