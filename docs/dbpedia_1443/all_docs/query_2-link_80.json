Unemployment remained well below the national average, and the state supported the creation of new good-paying jobs for Coloradans.

The Polis administration, in partnership with the legislature, took significant action to jump-start the efforts to increase housing supply, cut red tape, improve housing affordability, and ensure that Coloradans can live in the communities they love. The Governor also embarked on a state-wide listening tour to learn more about the solutions Coloradans deserve when it comes to issues like housing.\n\nTook Executive Action to increase housing opportunities, protect the environment, align transportation with the State’s growing needs, protect and increase economic growth and mobility, cut through bureaucracy, and consider the context and needs of different regions of the state.\n\nReleased a Roadmap to Colorado’s Future: 2026, which set forth a common vision and plan for how Colorado communities can grow in a way that enables affordability, high quality of life, and protects Colorado’s beautiful places and resources.\n\nContinued to push for Front Range Rail and the expansion of mountain passenger rail; selected for the competitive Corridor ID program.\n\nThe Governor, in partnership with the legislature, made transformational education investments that directly support teachers and students including data-driven solutions that improve learning.

Other initiatives that work to invest and improve education include:\n\nEnacting free universal preschool which is saving families thousands of dollars along with free full-day kindergarten, enrolling nearly 40,000 children in its first year.\n\nIncreasing per-pupil funding by 10.6%, or $22,000 more per classroom, in partnership with the legislature; investing in science and math education to boost achievement; distributed millions in funding to spur innovation in education and build new pathways for youth apprenticeship models across the state.\n\nProviding free college scholarships to help fill in-demand jobs; investing $25 million to provide $1,500 scholarships to the Class of 2024.\n\nThe Polis-Primavera administration continued working to save people money on healthcare, increase price transparency, and drive down the cost of insurance. Total savings for Coloradans since 2019 has increased to over $1B, including $411 million as a result of the bipartisan reinsurance program. Care Forward Colorado, Career Advance and other programs, like the Colorado Practice-based Health Education Grant Program, are developing the healthcare workers of the future.\n\nIn the face of unexpected increases in property tax rates, the administration, in partnership with the legislature, took action to provide property tax relief to Coloradans and save people money. Governor Polis also continued to fight back against an IRS attempt to tax TABOR refunds and encouraged local governments to take additional measures to provide property tax relief.
