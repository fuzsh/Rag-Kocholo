Laura Clellan will host Gold Star families and families of deployed Colorado National Guard members in separate events Dec. 16, 2023, at the Boettcher Mansion in Denver.\n\nGold Star families are those whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom.\n\nNearly 150 CONG members will spend the holidays away from their families while supporting operations overseas.\n\n“Our Colorado National Guard families make sacrifices and support our members while they serve,” Clellan said. “We continue to focus on ways to provide the best care for our families since they are the foundation of our force.”\n\nColorado Air National Guard and Colorado Army National Guard senior leaders will attend and visit with the families while the children enjoy crafts and treats provided by the CONG Family Programs staff.\n\nThe arrival of Santa Claus in a military vehicle and a storybook reading by Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera will be highlights at the events.\n\nThese events are not open to the public."
