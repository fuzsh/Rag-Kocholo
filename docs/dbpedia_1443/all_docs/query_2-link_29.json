Governor Sylvia Luke Joins Multi-State Reproductive Freedom Coalition\n\nHONOLULU — Hawaiʻi Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke has joined a group of 22 lieutenant governors in the formation of a Reproductive Freedom Coalition. Luke met with lieutenant governors and seconds-in-command during her March visit to the National Lieutenant Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe multi-state coalition representing more than 165 million people plans to work together to protect and expand reproductive freedom and access to health care in the wake of unprecedented attacks following the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n“Hawaiʻi was the first state to legalize abortion and we have continued to be at the forefront of efforts to protect and expand access to reproductive health care,” said Lt. Gov. Luke. “The signing of Senate Bill 1 is a huge step in ensuring access to essential health care and securing reproductive freedom throughout the Aloha State.”\n\nThe lieutenant governors who have joined the coalition are:\n\nArizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes\n\nCalifornia Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis\n\nConnecticut Lieutenant Governor Susan Bysiewicz\n\nColorado Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera\n\nDelaware Lieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long\n\nGuam Lieutenant Governor Josh Tenorio\n\nHawaiʻi Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke\n\nIllinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton\n\nPresident of the Maine Senate Troy Jackson\n\nMaryland Lieutenant Governor Aruna Miller\n\nMassachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll\n\nMichigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist\n\nMinnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan\n\nNew Jersey Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver\n\nNew Mexico Lieutenant Governor Howie Morales\n\nNew York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado\n\nOregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan\n\nPennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis\n\nRhode Island Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos\n\nVermont Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman\n\nWashington Lieutenant Governor Denny Heck\n\nWisconsin Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez\n\nThe formation of the Reproductive Freedom Coalition was spearheaded by Connecticut Lieutenant Governor Susan Bysiewicz. The network will work as a united front to share model legislation and executive orders, methods protecting health care providers from prosecution, ways to maximize federal funds for reproductive health care, and means of support for manufacturers of abortion medication and contraception as they face legal uncertainty.\n\n###"
