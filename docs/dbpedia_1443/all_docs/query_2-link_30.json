        "text": "COLORADO — Congressman Jason Crow (CO-06), Army veteran, Colorado Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Colorado Governor Jared Polis, Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera, and Major General Laura Clellan of the Colorado National Guard joined in support of the National Governors Association Council of Governors letter calling on the Department of Defense (DOD) to retract Legislative Proposal 480 (LP 480).\n\nThe flawed LP480 policy would forcibly transfer Air National Guard units performing space missions and move them into the U.S. Space Force (USSF) as “part-timers”, bypassing longstanding federal law which requires governors’ consent before transferring National Guard units to another branch of the military.\n\nColorado is home to over one-third of all space-related National Guard members.\n\nHere’s what they’re saying:\n\n“In Colorado, we understand the critical role our Air National Guard plays in providing for homeland defense and securing US space leadership – from Buckley SFB to Space Command. At a time when the US should be going above and beyond to outcompete our adversaries in space, LP 480 compromises Colorado’s Guard members serving that critical mission and holds us back,” said Congressman Crow. ” This should never be a question. I stand with my fellow Colorado leaders and Council of Governors in urging the Department of Defense to retract this fundamentally flawed proposal: LP 480 must be stopped.”\n\n“Colorado strongly opposes any involuntary removals of Air National Guard space units and personnel and any proposed reductions to the Colorado National Guard’s force. This proposal from the Air Force threatens the National Guard’s ability to support vital national security missions and domestic emergency operations. We are committed to working with Representative Crow, Colorado’s delegation, and my fellow Governors to ensure states can retain their rightful authority over their National Guard personnel and units,” said Governor Jared Polis.\n\n“The Colorado National Guard plays a critical role in ensuring our national security and responding to domestic emergencies. This proposal would remove authority from Governors, and could be detrimental to military readiness as well as members of the Guard, their families, and our communities,” said Lt. Governor Dianne Primavera.\n\n“By abandoning the traditionsof the Federal and State National Guard partnership, USAF’s proposal threatens to undo over 120 years of precedent and the very authority Congress placed on governors,”said Senator Bennet. “USAF’s evolution cannot come at the expense of the National Guard’s integrity and longstanding foundation. We must reject this flawed proposal.”\n\n“Our National Guard service members respond to their state’s unique needs and help make our country safer,” said Senator Hickenlooper. “It’s been the duty of governors for over a century to maintain that readiness, and any limit on this long-standing tradition would impair that ability.”"
