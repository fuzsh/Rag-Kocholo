        "text": "Hazardous Weather Outlook\n\nThe Hazardous Weather Outlook will describe potential hazardous weather and hydrologic information of concern in Days 1 through 7. The outlook contains two segments: One segment for the marine zones and adjacent land-based (i.e., coastal) zones and the other segment for the rest of the land-based zones. Each segment of the HWO will contain 3 sections: short term through Day 1, long term for Days 2-7, and spotter information.\n\nWind Chill Warning: Take Action! NWS issues a wind chill warning when dangerously cold wind chill values are expected or occurring. If you are in an area with a wind chill warning, avoid going outside during the coldest parts of the day. If you do go outside, dress in layers, cover exposed skin, and make sure at least one other person knows your whereabouts. Update them when you arrive safely at your destination.\n\nWind Chill Watch: Be Prepared: NWS issues a wind chill watch when dangerously cold wind chill values are possible. As with a warning, adjust your plans to avoid being outside during the coldest parts of the day. Make sure your car has at least a half a tank of gas, and update your winter survival kit.\n\nWind Chill Advisory: Be Aware: NWS issues a wind chill advisory when seasonably cold wind chill values but not extremely cold values are expected or occurring. Be sure you and your loved ones dress appropriately and cover exposed skin when venturing outdoors.\n\nHard Freeze Warning: Take Action! NWS issues a hard freeze warning when temperatures are expected to drop below 28°F for an extended period of time, killing most types of commercial crops and residential plants.\n\nFreeze Warning: Take Action! When temperatures are forecasted to go below 32°F for a long period of time, NWS issues a freeze warning. This temperature threshold kills some types of commercial crops and residential plants.\n\nFreeze Watch: Be Prepared: NWS issues a freeze watch when there is a potential for significant, widespread freezing temperatures within the next 24-36 hours. A freeze watch is issued in the autumn until the end of the growing season and in the spring at the start of the growing season.\n\nFrost Advisory: Be Aware: A frost advisory means areas of frost are expected or occurring, posing a threat to sensitive vegetation.\n\nWinter Storm Watch\n\nA Winter Storm Watch is issued when there is the potential for significant and hazardous winter weather within 48 hours. It does not mean that significant and hazardous winter weather will occur...it only means it is possible.\n\nSignificant and hazardous winter weather is defined as a combination of: 5 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or 7 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period AND/OR Enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or powerlines AND/OR a life threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nBlizzard Warning\n\nA Blizzard Warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected within the next 12 to 18 hours. Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less for 3 hours or longer AND Sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nThere is no temperature requirement that must be met to achieve blizzard conditions.\n\nWinter Storm Warning\n\nA Winter Storm Warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. Significant and hazardous winter weather is defined as a combination of:\n\n1) 5 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or 7 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period AND/OR Enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or powerlines. AND/OR a life threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind.\n\nIce Storm Warning\n\n¼ inch or more of ice accumulation.\n\nWinter Weather Advisory\n\nA Winter Weather Advisory will be issued for any amount of freezing rain, or when 2 to 4 inches of snow (alone or in combination with sleet and freezing rain), is expected to cause a significant inconvenience, but not serious enough to warrant a warning.\n\nFrost Advisory\n\nA Frost Advisory is issued when the minimum temperature is forecast to be 33 to 36 degrees on clear and calm nights during the growing season. A Frost Advisory is issued in the spring at the start of the growing season (when it is late enough to cause damage to new plants and crops).\n\nDense Fog Advisory\n\nA Dense Fog Advisory is issued when widespread fog is expected to reduce visibilities to 1/4 mile or less over a large area for an extended period of time (2 or more hours).\n\nHigh Wind Watch\n\nA High Wind Watch is issued when the following conditions are possible: sustained winds of 40 mph or higher for one hour or more OR wind gusts of 58 mph or higher for any duration.\n\nHigh Wind Warning\n\nA High Wind Warning is issued when sustained winds of 40 mph or higher for one hour or more OR wind gusts of 58 mph or higher for any duration.\n\nHurricane Watch\n\nA Hurricane Watch is issued when a tropical cyclone containing winds of 64 kt (74 mph) or higher poses a possible threat, generally within 48 hours. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding. The watch does not mean that hurricane conditions will occur. It only means that these conditions are possible.\n\nHurricane Warning\n\nA Hurricane Warning is issued when sustained winds of 64 kt (74 mph) or higher associated with a tropical cyclone are expected in 36 hours or less. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding. A hurricane warning can remain in effect when dangerously high water or a combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves continue, even though winds may be less than hurricane force.\n\nWind Advisory\n\nA Wind Advisory is issued when sustained winds of 31 to 39 mph for an hour or more AND/OR wind gusts of 46 to 57 mph for any duration.\n\nExtreme Wind Warning\n\nAn Extreme Wind Warning is issued for surface winds of 100 knots (115 MPH) or greater associated with non-convective, downslope, derecho (NOT associated with a tornado), or sustained hurricane winds are expected to occur within one hour.\n\nSmall Craft Advisory\n\nAn advisory issued by coastal and Great Lakes Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) for areas included in the Coastal Waters Forecast or Nearshore Marine Forecast (NSH) products. Thresholds governing the issuance of small craft advisories are specific to geographic areas. A Small Craft Advisory may also be issued when sea or lake ice exists that could be hazardous to small boats. There is no precise definition of a small craft. Any vessel that may be adversely affected by Small Craft Advisory criteria should be considered a small craft. Other considerations include the experience of the vessel operator, and the type, overall size, and sea worthiness of the vessel.\n\nGale Warning\n\nA warning of sustained surface winds, or frequent gusts, in the range of 34 knots (39 mph) to 47 knots (54 mph) inclusive, either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nGale Watch\n\nA watch for an increased risk of a gale force wind event for sustained surface winds, or frequent gusts, of 34 knots (39 mph) to 47 knots (54 mph), but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain.\n\nStorm Warning\n\nA warning of sustained surface winds, or frequent gusts, in the range of 48 knots (55 mph) to 63 knots (73 mph) inclusive, either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm Watch\n\nA watch for an increased risk of a storm force wind event for sustained surface winds, or frequent gusts, of 48 knots (55 mph) to 63 knots (73 mph), but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain.\n\nHurricane Force Wind Warning\n\nA warning for sustained winds, or frequent gusts, of 64 knots (74 mph) or greater, either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nSpecial Marine Warning\n\n(SMW) A warning product issued for potentially hazardous weather conditions usually of short duration (up to 2 hours) producing sustained marine thunderstorm winds or associated gusts of 34 knots or greater; and/or hail 3/4 inch or more in diameter; and/or waterspouts affecting areas included in a Coastal Waters Forecast, a Nearshore Marine Forecast, or an Great Lakes Open Lakes Forecast that is not adequately covered by existing marine warnings. Also used for short duration mesoscale events such as a strong cold front, gravity wave, squall line, etc., lasting less than 2 hours and producing winds or gusts of 34 knots or greater.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Watch\n\nThis is issued by the National Weather Service when conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. A severe thunderstorm by definition is a thunderstorm that produces one inch hail or larger in diameter and/or winds equal or exceed 58 miles an hour. The size of the watch can vary depending on the weather situation. They are usually issued for a duration of 4 to 8 hours. They are normally issued well in advance of the actual occurrence of severe weather. During the watch, people should review severe thunderstorm safety rules and be prepared to move a place of safety if threatening weather approaches.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warning\n\nThis is issued when either a severe thunderstorm is indicated by the WSR-88D radar or a spotter reports a thunderstorm producing hail one inch or larger in diameter and/or winds equal or exceed 58 miles an hour; therefore, people in the affected area should seek safe shelter immediately. Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with little or no advance warning. Lightning frequency is not a criteria for issuing a severe thunderstorm warning. They are usually issued for a duration of one hour. They can be issued without a Severe Thunderstorm Watch being already in effect.\n\nTornado Watch\n\nA Tornado Watch is issued when severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area. It does not mean that they will occur. It only means they are possible. Severe thunderstorms are defined as, winds of 58 mph or higher AND/OR Hail 1 inch in diameter or larger.\n\nTornado Warning\n\nThis is issued when a tornado is indicated by the WSR-88D radar or sighted by spotters; therefore, people in the affected area should seek safe shelter immediately. They can be issued without a Tornado Watch being already in effect. They are usually issued for a duration of around 30 minutes.\n\nTropical Storm Watch\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch is issued when a tropical cyclone containing winds of 34 to 63 kt (39 to 73 mph) or higher poses a possible threat, generally within 48 hours. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding. The watch does not mean that tropical storm conditions will occur. It only means that these conditions are possible.\n\nTropical Storm Warning\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is issued when sustained winds of 34 to 63 kt (39 to 73 mph) or higher associated with a tropical cyclone are expected in 36 hours or less. These winds may be accompanied by storm surge, coastal flooding, and/or river flooding.\n\nCoastal Flood Watch\n\nFlooding with significant impacts is possible. Coastal/Lakeshore Flood Watches are issued using the Coastal/Lakeshore Hazard Message (CFW) product.\n\nCoastal Flood Warning\n\nA Flooding that will pose a serious threat to life and property is occurring, imminent or highly likely. Coastal/Lakeshore Flood Warnings are issued using the Coastal/Lakeshore Hazard Message (CFW) product.\n\nCoastal Flood Advisory\n\nMinor flooding is possible (i.e., over and above normal high tide levels. Coastal/Lakeshore Flood Advisories are issued using the Coastal/Lakeshore Hazard Message (CFW) product.\n\nFlash Flood Watch\n\nA Flash Flood Watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flash flooding. It does not mean that flash flooding will occur, but it is possible.\n\nFlash Flood Warning\n\nA Flash Flood Warning is issued when flash flooding is imminent or occurring.\n\nFlood Watch\n\nA Flood Watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.\n\nFlood Warning\n\nA Flood Warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.\n\nRiver Flood Watch\n\nA River Flood Watch is issued when river flooding is possible at one or more forecast points along a river.\n\nRiver Flood Warning\n\nA River Flood Warning is issued when river flooding is occurring or imminent at one or more forecast points along a river.\n\nExcessive Heat Watch\n\nIssued by the National Weather Service when heat indices in excess of 105ºF (41ºC) during the day combined with nighttime low temperatures of 80ºF (27ºC) or higher are forecast to occur for two consecutive days.\n\nExcessive Heat Warning\n\nIssued within 12 hours of the onset of the following criteria: heat index of at least 105°F for more than 3 hours per day for 2 consecutive days, or heat index more than 115°F for any period of time.\n\nHeat Advisory\n\nIssued within 12 hours of the onset of the following conditions: heat index of at least 105°F but less than 115°F for less than 3 hours per day, or nighttime lows above 80°F for 2 consecutive days.\n\nRed Flag Warning\n\nA term used by fire-weather forecasters to call attention to limited weather conditions of particular importance that may result in extreme burning conditions. It is issued when it is an on-going event or the fire weather forecaster has a high degree of confidence that Red Flag criteria will occur within 24 hours of issuance. Red Flag criteria occurs whenever a geographical area has been in a dry spell for a week or two, or for a shorter period , if before spring green-up or after fall color, and the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) is high to extreme and the following forecast weather parameters are forecasted to be met:\n\n1) a sustained wind average 15 mph or greater\n\n2) relative humidity less than or equal to 25 percent and\n\n3) a temperature of greater than 75 degrees F.\n\nIn some states, dry lightning and unstable air are criteria. A Fire Weather Watch may be issued prior to the Red Flag Warning.\n\nGo here to access the National Weather Service glossary, the source of these definitions.\n\nOver the past decade, residents of Indianapolis have experienced substantial challenges related to violence and addiction. Where violence and addiction are present, the consequences ripple throughout the community resulting in chronic, multi-generational trauma. Systems of support – health care providers, corrections staff, educators, faith leaders and other community leaders – often find themselves in a position where they lack the skills to work through their own secondary and personal traumas, leaving them at risk for many of the same challenges faced by their patients, clients, students and parishioners.\n\nEskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative, a new Eskenazi Health-led program in partnership with Center for Mind-Body Medicine and funded, in part, by the Herbert Simon Family Foundation, aims to equip the community with skills proven to aid in alleviating trauma and secondary trauma. Using Center for Mind-Body Medicine’s evidence-based model, the program teaches participants how to use self-care and group support as tools for stress- and trauma-relief along with how to build resilience.\n\nThe program consists of two parts for trainees. Individuals will first go through the Professional Training Program and then follow that up with the Advanced Training Program. After the two-part training, individuals will be able provide people who are struggling with stress, anxiety and depression with instruction in basic stress- and trauma-relief services through mind-body skills groups, self-care workshops and in other appropriate settings.\n\nCMBM Professional Training Program for The Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative\n\nWhat is Mind-Body Medicine?\n\nMind-body medicine is based on the scientific understanding of the inextricable connection among our thoughts, sensations and feelings, and our mind, body, and spirit – between ourselves and the social and natural world in which we live. It focuses on the interactions between mind and body; and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social and spiritual factors can directly relieve stress and improve health. It is used with individuals, groups, and entire populations.\n\nMind-body skills are scientifically validated to reduce stress and restore physical and psychological health. The mind-body approach heals individual trauma and builds community-wide resilience.\n\nThe Center for Mind-Body Medicine’s (CMBM) approach to wellness is grounded in practical, evidence-based skills for self-care, nutrition, self-awareness, and group support. It emphasizes an approach that respects and enhances each person’s capacity for self-knowledge and self-care.\n\nWhat’s the Science Behind It?\n\nMind-body approaches use the conscious mind to directly affect the workings of the brain and the rest of the body. The techniques exert their effect on the hypothalamus, the switching station in the brain, which exercises control over the autonomic nervous system (which controls heart rate, blood pressure etc.), the endocrine (glandular) system and the immune system.\n\nThe scientific literature on these approaches is now rich and robust. Studies dating from the late 1960’s have shown the power of mind-body techniques to balance the over-activity of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system (“the fight or flight” and “stress” responses) which is implicated in many physical and emotional diseases and conditions, with parasympathetic nervous system stimulation that promotes relaxation.\n\nMore recently, these techniques have been demonstrated to create beneficial changes in many of the body’s physiological responses (including blood pressure, stress hormone levels, pain response and immune functioning) and to make a significant clinical difference in conditions as diverse as hypertension, HIV, cancer, chronic pain, and insomnia as well as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nWhat is the Center for Mind-Body Medicine?\n\nThe Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) was founded in 1991 by James S. Gordon, MD, a former researcher at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, a clinical professor of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at Georgetown Medical School, and former chair of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. Over the last 30 years, CMBM’s 160 global faculty members and 5,000 trained clinicians, educators, and community leaders have successfully brought programs of self-care and group support to hospitals and clinics, schools and universities, and to social service and community-based organizations around the world - particularly to populations touched by conflict, terrorism and natural disasters such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Israel, Gaza, Haiti, hurricane-ravaged southern Louisiana, Houston, and Puerto Rico, and with U.S. soldiers and veterans. Mind-Body Skills Groups (MBSGs) are CMBM’s signature small group model for teaching and learning self-care skills. CMBM Professional Training Program for The Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative\n\nMBSGs have repeatedly, in studies published in leading, peer-reviewed journals (including the first randomized controlled trial of any intervention with war-traumatized children), reduced the percentage of war-traumatized children and adults who qualify as having Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by 80% or more. Published research also demonstrates statistically significant decreases in depression, hopelessness, anxiety, anger, sleep disturbances, and stress hormones, and increases in quality of life.\n\nCMBM’s work has been featured in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic and on CBS 60 Minutes.\n\nWhat is this training program about?\n\nThe Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) and Eskenazi Health have created the Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative (HHHC) with the goal to bring an evidence-based program of population-wide healing and resilience-building to Indiana. The vision of HHHC is to address the psycho-social-spiritual needs of those on the front lines of community support. This Initiative will equip the community at large with skills proven to aid in alleviating trauma and secondary trauma, increasing self-regulation, and building resilience and hope for the future.\n\nThe Collaborative is organizing and implementing a comprehensive program of training, guidance and support for 140 mental health counselors, therapists, emergency first responders, teachers, school counselors, community health workers, and religious, spiritual and community leaders as they learn and integrate the CMBM model into their existing programs and services. In addition to the Collaborative partners, the program also aims to engage other local organizations that provide direct health, behavioral health, educational and spiritual services to the area’s most impacted children and adults.\n\nCMBM’s pioneering model is grounded in self-care and group support. It teaches participants a number of practical, easy-to-learn techniques, including:\n\n● several types of meditation\n\n● guided imagery\n\n● biofeedback and Autogenics\n\n● self-expression in words, drawings, and movement\n\nThese techniques and the “Mind-Body Skills Groups” in which they are taught make use of people’s strengths; encourage them to experiment with their own abilities; enhance their sense of control; and are interesting and fun.\n\nThe program uses a “train-the-trainer” approach. Participants first learn and practice the techniques on themselves, and then teach others in small, supportive Mind-Body Skills Groups, Self-Care Workshops, and individual and family sessions. This approach enables service providers to address their own stress, trauma and burnout, as well as help their communities.\n\nThe training program consists of a three-phased curriculum, each setting the foundation for the next. As a condition of acceptance into the program, each participant must be able to commit to all three phases of the curriculum. CMBM Professional Training Program for The Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative\n\nThe first phase, the Professional Training Program, will be held September 30, October 1, 2 and October 5 & 6. More information about this training is described below. The second phase, the Advanced Training Program, is scheduled for *November 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18, 2020 and teaches participants how to deliver this group model to their clients, patients, students, friends and families. *This is the projected window for the Advanced Training Program, and the final dates will be announced no later than the Professional Training Program.\n\nUpon completion of these first two phases, trainees will participate in a third phase (Practicum) in which they will co-facilitate two 8 to 10-week Mind-Body Skills Groups (MBSG) with supervision. From there, a select group will then be prepared to lead the effort locally through participation in CMBM’s Certification Program and a Leadership Training Program. The selected local Leadership team establishes the foundation for a long-term, sustaining presence in the community.\n\nWhat happens at the Initial Professional Training Program (Sept 30, Oct 1, 2, 5 and 6, 2020)?\n\nCMBM’s Professional Training Program offers an introduction to mind-body skills within the group context and focuses on teaching participants how to use these skills in their own self-care and how to begin to integrate the approach and techniques into their ongoing work as clinicians, community health workers, social service case workers, clergy, teachers, counselors and other caregiving professionals. These simple, transformative skills are the ideal antidote to stress and burnout, and the perfect tools for the caregiver’s toolkit.\n\nThe training includes extensive scientific material on the biology and physiology of stress and burnout and on the specific techniques used, as well as experiential work in an intensive, supportive small group.\n\nOver the course of the 5-day Professional Training, trainees will participate in large group plenary sessions in which senior CMBM faculty teach the science of mind-body medicine. Plenary presentations include:\n\n● Overview of the New Medicine\n\n● Introduction to Mind-Body Skills Groups\n\n● Biological Underpinnings of Mind-Body Therapies\n\n● Imagery\n\n● Mobilizing, Transforming, and Celebrating the Emotions\n\n● Genograms\n\n● Breathing, Physical Exercise and Movement\n\n● Trauma and Transformation\n\n● Spirituality and Healing\n\n● Body Awareness\n\nDuring the training program, trainees will also participate in eight Mind-Body Skills Groups in which they will learn one or two mind-body techniques (such as meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, working with drawings, breathing and movement). The group combines the didactic learning, experiential learning, practice and group support. In the small supportive groups, led by CMBM faculty, trainees practice mind-body techniques and experience their effects personally. The small groups provide an opportunity for self-expression and mutual support. These experiences of self-care – experiencing one’s ability, for example, to lower blood pressure or decrease anxiety – enhance each person’s sense of self-CMBM Professional Training Program for The Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative efficacy and self-responsibility even as they provide direct physiological benefits. The groups also offer members support in making the major changes in lifestyle which are required to alter the course of chronic physical and emotional problems. This is not a therapy group! However, we find that sharing and connecting with others creates a wonderful learning environment, helping each individual become more self-aware and more engaged in their own self-care.\n\nParticipants are never forced to share beyond their comfort level; but in order to share the techniques with patients and clients, it is crucial that they experience them first hand and “walk the talk”. Each group has approximately ten participants and one faculty member, and the group stays together throughout the program, learning together and often becoming friends for years to come. A majority of participants list the small group in post-program evaluations as their favorite part of the program! And understandably– this is the part that supports your own healing and self-care, and eventually that of your family, friends and patients.\n\nEskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative: A Comprehensive Wellness Program for Our Communities\n\nEskenazi Health’s Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative (HHHC) is a multi-year initiative will build on an established partnership between Eskenazi Health and The Center for Mind Body Medicine (CMBM) to enhance the capacity of our community to address challenges of chronic stress and trauma. The program is being made possible, in part, by a grant from the Herbert Simon Family Foundation. During the multi-year project, thousands of local residents will be impacted by the expansion of CMBM’s in-depth, mind-body medicine training. The ongoing supervision and mentorship of 140 key staff from Eskenazi Health and collaborating organizations, as well as the development of a local leadership team will build a solid foundation to support the work for years to come and provide a program of population-wide healing and wellness that can be a model for similarly challenged cities across the United States.\n\nThe proposed project includes the following components:\n\nProfessional Training Program (PTP) – This initial five-day training provides a comprehensive introduction to CMBM’s approach through didactic instruction on the scientific basis for the model and small and large group experiences of mind-body techniques. The training includes in-depth material on the biology and psychology of stress and trauma as well as the specific evidence-based mind-body techniques used.\n\nAdvanced Training Program (ATP) – This additional training (four to five days) is designed to help trainees deepen their experience and confidence with the skills learned during PTP, and equip them to utilize the skills with patients, clients, students and colleagues. It includes a combination of didactic lectures on implementing the model along with practicums in which trainees lead groups, teach the techniques, and receive support and feedback from senior CMBM faculty.\n\nUpon completion of the training, all trainees will be equipped to implement the CMBM model of self-care and group support in their work organizations during a Practicum phase. Trainees will be expected to lead Mind-Body skills groups and workshops for trauma-affected children and adults, community members, colleagues, clients, and students. They will also integrate the principles and practices of mind-body medicine into their work with individuals and families. Intensive supervision and mentorship will be provided to support new Trainees as they integrate the model into their work.\n\nAfter completion of the Practicum phase, the Collaborative will identify forty facilitators to participate in CMBM’s Certification program. This Certification process enhances their understanding of the model, strengthens their skills as a facilitator, and deepens their commitment to carry the work forward in the community. A subset of twenty of the most skilled Certified Facilitators will then complete Leadership and Supervision training, equipping them to provide supervision to local participants, and ensuring the sustainability and continued growth of the program.\n\nStandardized assessment tools will be used to evaluate the program’s impact on facilitators and Mind-Body skills group participants in the community. It is expected that facilitators and participants will experience decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, with results that are maintained at a three-month follow-up. Research indicates that trauma, stress and violence feed off of each other, often with tragic results. Similarly, stress has been identified as a key risk factor for addiction. By teaching tangible skills to better manage stress, anxiety, and depression, the project addresses the key root causes of widespread addiction and violence in central Indiana and will be expected over time to contribute to significant reductions. The program will be carefully documented so as to become a replicable model throughout the country.\n\nThe Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative: Training Participant Selection Criteria & Guidelines\n\nParticipant Selection Criteria Guidelines\n\nSince space will be limited in this program, we have developed the following guidelines to help us select applicants who will be best positioned to help us achieve our goal of reach and sustainability. The Eskenazi Health Hoosier Heartland Healing Collaborative (HHHC) and CMBM will vet and select participants based on the following criteria.\n\nApplicants with the following qualities will be given priority for acceptance into the program.\n\nProgram participants should:\n\n1. Be in a position to reach a significant number of people in the Greater Indianapolis area or the participant’s surrounding community\n\n2. Have the capacity to implement a group model in their normal service delivery to clients/patients/parishioners/students/colleagues\n\n3. Be eager to participate in the training – engaged, excited, willing to put in some energy\n\n4. Be able and interested in learning new skills\n\n5. Demonstrate a capacity for self-awareness\n\n6. Have the capacity to be self-reflective and open to new ideas\n\n7. Have the ability to be present to others without being reactionary\n\n8. Commit to 100% participation in each phase of the training program in which they are selected to participate\n\n9. Commit to co-facilitation of two rounds of 8-week mind-body skills groups (MBSGs) in the community and/or with colleagues\n\n10. Commit to co-lead one workshop introducing mind-body medicine to the community you serve\n\nIdeally, an even number of people (not less than 4) will represent each partner organization/coalition so that they may better support each other and enhance the commitment to long-term sustainability within their organization. Organizations should consider size, dispersal ratio within the organization, and their commitment to long-term engagement with the Collaborative and use of the Mind-Body Medicine Model when considering their attendance commitments.\n\nIn some cases, it may be most efficient to organize a meeting with potential participants to elicit interest and address questions.\n\nIt is essential that both the partner organization as well as the training participant is aware of and committed to the full scope of the program. See document “HHHC – Commitments of Trainees & Partner Organizations”\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that the initial training is very experiential. This first training is for them, the trainees, to have the full immersive group experience rather than simply trying to understand the model cognitively. They will be learning from each other, deepening their own self-awareness and learning skills through large group lectures and small group participation."
