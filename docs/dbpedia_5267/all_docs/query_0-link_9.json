        "text": "The simple reason that there will never be another Mabel in Hollywood, is that Mabel was someone of her time. What do we mean by that? We mean that an entity was thrown up, that could only have existed during this particular period i.e. the early twentieth century. What was going on in the early twentieth century was conducive to a whole plethora of new industries coming into being, and each one would throw up its own figures of note. The one that most springs to mind is Henry Ford, in the automobile industry, but the movie industry threw up two legendary figures, director D.W. Griffith and actress Mabel Normand. Griffith, of course is part of Mabel’s story, but she isn’t really part of Griffith’s story, the leading figures there, were Florence Lawrence and Lillian Gish. It seems likely that, if the movies had not been created, then we would never have heard of Mabel Normand. Let’s start with a thumbnail sketch of the movie industry, and Mabel’s place within it, from the 1910s through the 1920s.\n\nIn 1910, the film industry was very modest in size, and was only just heaving itself out of the disreputable nickelodeon era. Studios were rather small, and were privately financed, as the banks would not risk money on these hand-to-mouth operations. Producers did, however, gain loans, using their private assets, or those of a rich uncle, as security. In the main, the movies drew from the lower echelons of society, many of the producers being refugees from the second-hand cloak and suit trade, or in the case of Mack Sennett, from the naughty stage-show business. The actors were former mechanics, shop-girls, hat-makers, or the like, although a considerable number had toured on the country’s theatre circuits, and from an early age. There were no real movie stars back then, but the Biograph studios gave many leading parts to Florence Lawrence, who came from the Vitagraph, where actors names were given. Biograph did not do this, but the Vitagraph actors, moving to other studios were recognised. Thus it was, that Florence became as close to a star as you could get, in those days. On her heels came Mary Pickford, fresh from the theatrical circuits, where she’d worked since a babe in arms. Mary had been something of a star on the stage, her blondilocks hairstyle being a big hit. Florence and Mary soon clashed, as they battled for plum parts. Both were very aloof, although Mary realised that it was to her advantage to be humble among her peers. Florence did not, and was very unpopular around the studio. There is an important point here, in that the actors thought they should stick together. Their enemies were the producers, the studio owners, who were much like movie villains, in their top hats and tails, cruising around in expensive motor-cars. The actors were not really egalitarian, but if a person was in trouble, everyone was expected to help out. Mack Sennett later explained it like this “We were all there for a dollar and dinner.” What he meant was that they worked for a dollar-a-day, and dinner was the dry, curled up sandwiches handed out by the studio at mid-day. In the 3-storey house that served as the Biograph studio, there would be up to 200 people, chattering around the sets, or lounging on the stairways, all hoping to get a part of some sort. Into this human menagerie there came one day, a small dark-haired girl, Mabel Normand, asking to see Mr Griffith. Mary Pickford saw her arrive, and instantly ran for Griffith.\n\n“Mister Griffith, you must see the new girl who’s arrived.”\n\n“Why, is she a blond?”\n\n“No, no, she’s dark, with big brown eyes, and three-inch eyelashes!”\n\nGriffith immediately hired the girl with the 3-inch eyelashes. Mary was not entirely being charitable towards Mabel, for she surmised that Mabel could do the roles she hated i.e. ‘bad girl’ and vamp roles. This proved to be Mabel’s forte, until she got into comedy. Mabel proved to be very talented, but more than that, she was a hit on the social scene. The actors and actresses swarmed around her like bees around their queen. “Mabel was the most wonderful girl in the world, the most beautiful, the best sport” said Mrs Griffith fifteen years later. The best sport, because she seemed capable of anything – riding bucking broncos, diving off cliffs, swimming rapids, and winning the cross-country runs organised by Mack Sennett. The actresses that gathered around her, hoped for just one thing, that they would go to bed as Lottie Pickford, or Dorothy Gish, and awake the next morning as Mabel Normand. As for the actors, they hoped to gain the heart of Mabel, and many a month’s wages was spent wooing the ‘girl with the eyelashes’ only to find, once they’d presented the diamond ring, that they dropped out of favour. The ring was never returned, and Mabel’s wardrobe of Parisian clothes seemed to grow daily. As Charlie Chaplin put it half-a-century later:\n\n“Everyone adored Mabel.”\n\nWhat we have been describing is a rather parochial form of Hollywood, although in the early days, the term ‘Hollywood’ had not yet been coined. Everyone mucked in, carrying and painting scenery, sweeping, or whatever job needed doing. In essence the actors, actresses and directors grew up together, and the core of the later silent Hollywood was composed mainly, of the original megaphone men and players of 1910. Loyalty among the players was expected, and if someone was on a good run of roles and pay, well, it was only right that they should help their less fortunate fellows. Mabel Normand turned out to be the most altruistic of the actresses, and went beyond the call of duty to help others. She was, nonetheless, fiercely competitive, and although of less experience and less training than the theatrical people, she soon showed that she was willing to fight for a place at the top table, where the star of that day dined on steaks alongside D.W. Griffith. At the Vitagraph studio, Mabel also raised eyebrows among the company, with her vivacious personality, cutting wit, and seductive ways. She caught the attention of top comedian, John Bunny. It was in the Bunny pictures that Mabel began to excel, displacing his previous strange-looking co-star, Flora Finch. The ruthless Mabel later told, with a half-veiled smirk, how Flora had been great, until she was replaced by younger, more capable comedienne.\n\nReturning to Biograph, now a named star, Mabel not only resumed her old position, but enhanced that position. Her situation was now that of Queen Bee, with the men swarming around her, and the women, shall we say, sitting at her feet. Multi-facetted was Mabel, and while a rare beauty to the men, the girls noted that, while possessing a magnetic personality, she was the model of emancipation. Mabel was now crossing and re-crossing the line between drama and comedy, starring in the former with Griffith and the latter with Mack Sennett. This ability made her even more admirable in the eyes of the Biograph people, gaining her much respect and kudos, among the company. It was during this time that Mack Sennett began to make a move on Mabel, plying her with diamonds, and as he later said, with milk-shakes. Mrs Griffith records both of these things in her book, and says that Mabel once threw a diamond necklace back at the King of Comedy, and she actually asked the question:\n\n“Would Mack Sennett ever buy a girl a milk-shake?”\n\nThe quote implies, of course, that Sennett had no intrinsic desire for females, and the necklace incident that Mabel realised his falsehood. This rather dispels the myth that Mack and Mabel were lovers. Clearly, Mack had a great need for Mabel, as he was negotiating with movie wise-guys Kessell and Baumann, for the post of supervising director within a newly set up studio. Respect and kudos were the elements that Mabel would bring to that studio, being known as the slim girl in a swimsuit from a Sennett comedy, and the tragic figure in ‘The Mender of Nets’, a Griffith picture co-starring Mary Pickford. It was principally Mary that tried to dissuade Mabel from going off with Sennett, who was regarded as a dangerous buffoon and lame-brain. Mary herself had made the mistake of leaving for the newly created IMP company, which ultimately failed, and it may be that her respect for Mabel was such that she thought she ought to warn Mabel. Mabel did eventually sign for the new company, Keystone, but her contract bore the signatures of the highly respected Kessell and Baumann, not Mack Sennett.\n\nMabel’s new contract, for $125 a week, made her the highest paid actress in the business, and she was soon setting the screens on fire as the Keystone Girl. She had her own kingdom down on Alessandro Street, LA, where her subjects, the actors, doted on her. However, her kingdom expanded, as more and more studios sent their companies westward. Many of the actresses were saddled with chaperones, a necessity for the studios, as morality laws and something called the Mann Act, made it illegal to transport under-age girls (the average silent actress was 16 years of age) across state lines, for immoral purposes, and any decent prosecutor could make a case for the movies being immoral. Mabel’s reputation as a kind of ‘agony aunt’ hails from this time, when the burden must have been heavy on such young shoulders. Some years previously, the 14-year old Mabel had been taken onboard, in Manhattan, by the 17 year-old Alice Joyce, herself a ‘runaway’. The upshot of all of this, was that Mabel became the core of the incipient Hollywood, and in the early days, even producers would look her up, on their first arrival in Los Angeles. Several things made Mabel stand out by the mid-1910s – her ability to hunt out the latest fashions, occupy the headlines, pursue dangerous activities, and hold the best parties. We might add that she gained respect by never being a fool to the producers. It is a testament to her astuteness that none of these guys were ever able to determine whether she was disrespecting them, or not. Other girls, crudely imitating her, found their careers held back.\n\nEventually, one producer did come to learn that getting it wrong with Mabel, would make his life a hell. In 1926, Mabel briefly made films for Hal Roach, a hard-nosed Irishman, who brooked no dissent, and kept Stan Laurel in a form of servitude. Roach, known by Mabel as “That thick-necked Mick”, was a pompous oaf, who thought women should stick to rattling pots and pans. However, he became a regular victim of Mabel’s cutting wit, and would often be driven from his studio, by Mabel and her girlfriends, who pursued the producer with a multitude of oaths and cusses. She was, said Hal, “The dirtiest-talking girl you ever heard.” If he had bowed before his Queen, things would have been much easier for him. One guy who had bowed before the Queen was producer Sam Goldwyn. A relative newcomer to the movie business, Mabel was already the Queen of The Movies, when he arrived, and he just knew he had to have her. Mabel also created havoc in Sam’s new, all-star studio, as she declared war on his prima-donnas, the stage and opera stars. However, Sam clung doggedly to Mabel, a star, a legend, from the time when he sat in front of the screen, rather than behind it. Even in bankruptcy, Sam tried to keep hold of Mabel, but an offer of $30,000 from Mack Sennett, would free him of any obligation as regards Mabel’s future welfare. So it was that the King of Comedy re-acquired ‘The Legend’ but the old rapport between them was now gone. Mack was quite pleased with himself, and the entire company was delighted to have a figurehead star at their studio. As far as Mabel was concerned, Mack had gained her services by matter of circumstance, and she would never forget the way he had treated her in 1915. She was about to serve revenge – cold. While she attended public functions with the King, she refused to have anything to do with him privately, although he managed to hood-wink her into attending her birthday party, organised by Sennett. No expense was spared on publicity for Mabel and her films, but it seems Mabel did not want to hang around. She latched onto a guy named William Desmond Taylor, who was a director at Paramount studios. Taylor’s butler and Mack Sennett, it seems, took the view that Mabel was trying to get into Paramount, via Taylor’s position. Next thing, Taylor was found with a .38 calibre hole in him. No-one knew who shot Taylor, but Sennett remained a suspect, until the case was stood down in the 1950s. Mabel was never a suspect, but the police and the majority of the press, were certain she knew the identity of the killer. All kinds of scandalous stuff was thrown at Mabel, by the gutter press, so scandalous, in fact, that her friends in Hollywood felt obliged to publicly defend her, at great risk to their own reputations. Mabel had created enemies in the journalistic press, by allowing only a favoured few scribes to have personal interviews. To them, the death of Taylor was a great opportunity to wreak revenge on the impudent Mabel. If Hollywood had made her their goddess, then they’d knock her off her pedestal. Well, they were never quite able to inflict damnatio memoriae on Mabel, and although out of pictures for three years, she was still making money, and delivering the wildest parties in Hollywood. Oh, and capturing the headlines too.\n\nA year with Hal Roach, in 1926, got Mabel back on the screen, much to the joy of her fans, one of whom, Anita Garvin, starred alongside her in ‘Raggedy Rose’. The fans were less delighted in 1927, when Mabel fell sick, and disappeared for a while. She rose like a phoenix in 1928, and appeared as fit as the proverbial butcher’s dog, showing up at premieres and gracing Hollywood parties. It seems she had a ‘talkie’ screen test for MGM, which excited everyone, but nothing came of that, as Mabel again became sick. She was still making the headlines in 1929, but in September it was announced that she had been admitted to a sanitorium for treatment of a respiratory ailment. Despite announcements that Mabel was improving, she died on February 23rd 1930, aged thirty-seven. Shock and disbelief gripped the movie and movie magazine industries, at around 3 a.m. when the news was first released. A party held at the house of Lew Cody, where most of Hollywood had gathered, was besieged by reporters. Everyone gave their obituaries with little prompting, led by Charlie Chaplin, who gave numerous accounts of Mabel’s life that morning, but continued to gush uncontrollably for the next few days. By comparison, Mack Sennett, when told the news, merely said “This is indeed most regrettable.” Mabel’s funeral was set for a week hence, and it was decided that all studios would close that day, so that the crews and actors could attend. Cowboy comedian, Will Rogers, appealed for calm, as it was suspected that a public riot could ensue. He further asked that no-one that had not known Mabel write anything about her. The funeral service was conducted in downtown Los Angeles, and thousands of people gathered outside the chapel, remaining respectfully silent throughout. The honorary pallbearers were the good and the great of the movie industry – Goldwyn, Mayer, Sennett, Griffith, Fairbanks, Palette, along with Judge James and airman Col. Art Goebel. The mood of the attendees was thoughtful, rather than sombre – if anyone had previously any doubt that the silent movie was being buried that day, then this was now clearly dispelled. Coincidence, or not, only one silent feature film was made after this date, and fittingly, it was Charlie Chaplin’s ‘City Lights’.\n\nTime to Answer The Question.\n\nIt is clear from the above that the early movie business can be described as parochial in nature. The directors, the actors, the actresses, the crewmen, and indeed, the producers, grew up together. The enemy – the press, the moralists – lay outside the studios, and it was desirable, nay essential, for the movie people to stand together. Cliquey? Well, maybe, and it was certainly difficult for newcomers to slot in. Those actors and actresses in the business in, say 1910, went on to form the core of the later Hollywood, and were, to some extent, unassailable. One of these was Mabel Normand, whose career Mrs Griffith termed “Astonishing!” Astonishing, because without stage-mother or man to support her, and lacking in theatrical training, she took her place among the ‘greats’, some of whom were later to write highly of her. She was to take a legendary place in Hollywood, which as it grew, gathered new producers, who were most interested in meeting ‘The Legend’. They all adored Mabel, but there is some suggestion that they were a little afraid of her ability to carry actors, and (in particular) actresses along with her. Signing Mabel, also brought other problems for producers, for her films with Mack Sennett were so successful that the fear of failure haunted them. Indeed, Sam Goldwyn was widely criticised, when his screenplays for Mabel turned out to be inferior than those of Keystone and The Mabel Normand Film Company. We must return to Charlie Chaplin’s “Everyone adored Mabel.”\n\nBy 1927, at the latest, everyone was aware that sound was coming to the movies, and that this meant a great investment for the old studios. Even Mack Sennett, he of the tumbledown, makeshift studio, abandoned the homely Alessandro Street premises, for new sound stages at Studio City. Newcomers to Hollywood now sported horn-rimmed glasses, and bore briefcases. They were the bankers, and soon their representatives would grace the boardrooms of every studio and film distributor company. The Hollywood ‘club’ was finished, there was no room now for loyalty and friendship, just money management. The moneymen insisted on maximisation of profits – actors would punch time cards, studio lunches would be paid for, and distributors would ensure that theatre owners revamp their premises, with Byzantine lobbies and plush seating. Sennett Comedies, for example, would join forces with Paramount, who would distribute the former’s films to luxurious picture palaces, and just in time for the 1930s depression to bite. Over-leveraged, Paramount tottered, then fell, taking Sennett with it. The situation was similar all over Hollywood, and the economic conditions produced more and more cost-cutting, although the studios still had their stars. These stars, however, were different, and we might call them the ‘unfree’. Sure, they still had their mansions, and fancy cars, but these were on loan from the studios, and could be withdrawn at any time. The days of marble baths in plush dressing rooms were over, as were the days when Mabel Normand would lie for hours, soaking in her Cleopatran tub. There was no time during the day, and, at night, when Mabel Normand and friends might have been whooping it up, her successors spent their nights, as Louise Brooks tells us in her book, learning lines from a script. The stars, though, still attempted to play the movie-star bit, especially as Mabel’s legend persisted into the 1930s and 1940s. Some actresses, such as Paulette Goddard, attempted to play ‘Mabel’ with the producers, and completely bombed. In his book, her husband Charlie Chaplin says “She could have played Scarlet O’Hara in ‘Gone With The Wind’ if only she’d kept her mouth shut.” Paulette had the raw truculence, but not the disarming charm of Mabel. Soon after ‘The Wind’ was released, the same producers paid homage to Mabel, “The girl with the golden heart”, at the opening of the Mabel Normand Soundstage in Republic’s L.A. Studio. The producers, Zukor, Mayer, Goldwyn, DeMille and company had survived, along with Mabel’s memory, deep into the talkie era. Nonetheless, they were not prepared, or not able, to let a small, dark-haired girl dominate them, or their industry, ever again. The Hollywood shenanigans now took place in the studio boardrooms, well away from the actors, the actresses, the directors, and the cameramen. Never again would, or could, a personage such as Mabel Normand be thrown up by the movie industry.\n\nBibliography\n\nWhen the Movies Were Young by Linda Griffith (1925).\n\nKing of Comedy by Mack Sennett (1954).\n\nLulu in Hollywood by Louise Brooks (1974).\n\nLove, Laughter and tears: My Hollywood Story by Adela Rogers St. Johns (1978).\n\nSunshine and Shadow by Mary Pickford (1956).\n\nMabel Normand’s Own Life Story by Chandler Sprague.
