        "text": "Dramatic on screen and off. Hugh Grant has found himself at the center of several controversies over the years.\n\nWhile walking the red carpet at the Oscars in March 2023, the Love, Actually star was quickly called out online after an interview with Ashley Graham on ABC’s Academy Awards pre-show. When asked by the model what his favorite part of the awards ceremony was, he responded, “It’s fascinating. The whole of humanity is here. It’s Vanity Fair.”\n\nGraham was unaware that the actor was not referring to the Vanity Fair Oscars party, but rather the phrase “vanity fair,” defined by Merriam Webster as “a scene or place characterized by frivolity and ostentation.”\n\nThings only got more awkward as the Notting Hill star began unenthusiastically responding with short answers, such as saying he wasn’t rooting for any nominees in particular and stating that he couldn’t remember the name of the tailor who worked on his suit.\n\nThe interview concluded with the reporter asking him about appearing in one of the night’s nominated films Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, in which he made a cameo as the partner of Daniel Craig’s detective Benoit Blanc. “Well, I’m barely in it,” he stated. “I’m in It for about three seconds.”\n\nOn top of that, when asked if he had fun shooting the Knives Out sequel, Grant — who has been married to his wife, Anna Eberstein, since 2018 — simply responded with, “Almost.”\n\nSeveral fans took to social media to criticize Grant’s behavior. “Is Hugh Grant just an arrogant d–k all the time? He was so rude to Ashley Graham on the red carpet, complete with an eye roll. Maybe he should stay home if he’s too good for his industry of choice,” one person tweeted during the pre-show, while another wrote, “Hugh Grant just gave one of the worst interviews I’ve ever watched on live tv lol. Admittedly, the question kinda sucked but he was NOT trying to support the interviewer at all.”\n\nPerhaps one of the Four Weddings and a Funeral star’s biggest controversies is that of his 1995 affair with Divine Brown. He was caught cheating on his then-girlfriend of eight years, Elizabeth Hurley, with the hooker, for which he was arrested on a misdemeanor lewd conduct charge. He later pleaded guilty and was charged with two years’ probation.\n\nWhile the incident didn’t split them up, the two eventually called it quits after 13 years together in 2000, and they have remained good friends since. “I think when you’ve been with someone for a long time, they are family,” Hurley told Access Hollywood in March 2015 while recalling their split. “And to me, he’s like a big brother. Or not even a bigger brother, ‘cause sometimes I’m more grown up than him. But we’re like siblings.”\n\nTheir friendly relationship doesn’t mean the Austin Powers star won’t throw a jab at her ex. On a March 2015 episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, she said, “I love him, but he’s very annoying.”\n\nScroll below for all the details on Grant’s biggest public controversies:"
