        "text": "Legends, laughter, and love take center stage in STG's 2022/23 Silent Movie Mondays series. Audiences will be treated to films from the 1920s and earlier, including Go West on Nov. 21, It on Feb. 13, Exit Smiling on May 8, andComedy Shorts on July 31. The season features performances by some of the era's most iconic stars including Buster Keaton, Clara Bow, Beatrice Lillie, Jack Pickford, Mabel Normand, Baby Peggy, and Charlie Chaplin. The films spring to life with musical accompaniment by some of the most accomplished organists working today on the Mighty Wurlitzer—an organ original to the 94-year-old Paramount Theatre.\n\n\"Today's performances onstage at the Paramount are built on the bones of the not-so-silent era of the past, which featured vaudeville opening acts, the Mighty Wurlitzer in all its glory, plus exploding sound effects,\" said Vicky Lee, STG's Silent Film Program curator. \"Our organists Tedde Gibson, Donna Parker, Christian Elliott, Tyler Pattison (with an added treat of Foley Sound by Paul Hansen for the shorts), make these movies come alive through their music.\"\n\nAt Seattle Theatre Group—the arts nonprofit which operates the Paramount (as well as the Neptune and Moore theatres)—stories unfold through live entertainment—and through the magic of film, too. In 1928, the Paramount opened its doors with the feature film Feel My Pulse. Now, almost 100 years later, the cinematic tradition lives on with Silent Movie Mondays.\n\nASL interpretation is provided for speaker introductions and discussions for all film events.\n\n2022/23 Silent Movie Monday Season at the Paramount Theatre:\n\nGo West(1925) | 7 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 21, 2022\n\nBuster Keaton stars in the comedy Go West (1925) preceded by the short One Week (1920), both written, directed and produced by Keaton.

Placed on the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2008 and featuring extraordinary sight gags, One Week involves a newlywed couple who receive a built-it-yourself house as a wedding gift.\n\nPre-film introduction and CineClub post-film discussion with Buster Keaton biographer and Slate film critic, Dana Stevens.
