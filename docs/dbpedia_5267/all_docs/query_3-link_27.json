        "text": "The Continuing investigation into The Girl From Staten Island.\n\nIn the first part of this post, we looked at Mabel’s early life, and her developmental years in the movie industry. Very little is certain about her birth and early years on Staten Island, except that she was something of loner and, paradoxically, a tearaway. It is likely that she attended a convent school, following a period of truancy from public school in New Brighton. It is also likely that she was sent away, not for purely educational purposes, but because she had, perhaps, become untameable. We can assume she mixed with some particularly wayward girls at the convent, and I had suggested in part 1 that Mabel was housed in what was known as a nun-administered Mary Magdalene Laundry – a reformatory in fact. Mabel appears to have always been somewhat estranged from her family, who she seems to have been glad to leave behind, when she left for California. There is no indication that Mabel’s parents came out to Hollywood before her death, although brother Claude was resident there for a number of years after 1919.\n\nMabel visited Staten Island once a year, but she does not seem to have visited on every occasion she was in New York. Unlike other girls, Mabel, consequently, had no ‘stage mother’ or chaperone, when she modeled for artists, or acted at the Biograph studios. Mabel was a loose cannon, “…who brooked no bridle.” She kow-towed to no-one, and was fired from two studios for ‘unacceptable’ behavior. When the Biograph company left for L.A., director D.W. Griffith left the surly, bad-ass Mabel behind. Unfortunately, Mabel had already corrupted some of Griffith’s charges, and two girls, Dot Gish and Gertie Bambrick, slipped their chaperones, and set out to be Mabel Normand, by hitting the town and getting drunk. Blanche Sweet once alluded to the fact that the irreverent Mabel had corrupted them all.\n\nMabel, then, really was Peck’s Bad Girl (a Mabel film of 1918) and someone who would never get anywhere in films, or life, according to D.W. Griffith. How shocked was the ‘genius’ in 1916, when he saw Mabel’s name go up on her new studio, not more than two blocks from his Reliance-Majestic studio in Hollywood? Did he simply mutter “She’s a success” then slump into a chair? Mabel had risked everything to get that studio – she’d made a play at dumping Triangle, New York Motion Pictures and Keystone, then sat alone in a New York hotel, putting it out that she was signing with Mutual to be the leading lady in Charlie Chaplin films. It was all very risky, but then Mabel was ever the risk-taker – she took on the most powerful men in motion pictures and won, becoming the first actor or actress to put her name over a studio. Forget Chaplin, Griffith, Pickford and Sennett – she was the first! Other so-called firsts were mere illusions, created, not by Mabel, but the Sennett publicity machine. Mabel the first woman to fly, Mabel the first to wear a one-piece bathing costume, Mabel the first one to throw a pie – they are all just legends. The curious thing is that Mabel didn’t need any of this, as what she did achieve was more than enough to put her at the top of the movie hierarchy. The legends were only necessary to give kudos to Keystone Studios.\n\nMabel, it must be said, did not always win – sometimes she made mistakes, and huge ones at that. The second time she ran away (1917), and holed up in New York (swearing to the press that she would not honor her newly-signed contract with Sam Goldwyn, but would sign with anyone with enough cash) she achieved nothing but disaster. Instead of Sennett chasing after her, he ignored her, and merely sent lawyers to renegotiate her Goldwyn pay deal. Mack’s hands were tied, as Goldwyn had threatened to slap a law suit on anyone that tried to sign Mabel. This led Mabel into the worst four years of her life.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Mabel suffered from depression all of her life. Her antics at Biograph and Vitagraph were merely intended to mask her insecurity. Making yourself the belle of the ball, or the chief clown is always popular with your peers. It was for a solid reason that Griffith cast Mabel in tragic roles. Mabel was a tragic figure, and her mastery of pathos and tragedy were legendary at Biograph. So tragically evil did Mabel appear to Gladys Smith (Mary Pickford) that she wrote this in her newspaper column:\n\n“Because she was dark and the representative type of villainess, she was made to play the flashing-eyed creature of temperament, whose very looks were stilettos in your heart, and whose movements undulated like a snake in the brush. The thousands who have laughed with her on the screen in her last few years of comedy perhaps have forgotten her as a heavy woman”. The Times-Democrat 3 January 1916.\n\nUndoubtedly Mabel’s antics scared The Sweetheart during The Mender of Nets (1912), but it could not have escaped her that the coming Keystone Girl had also acted her clear off the set. Here we have an important detail about Mabel Normand. She was a great tragedienne, who could shed tears at the drop of camera shutter, scream, tear her hair out, and look totally convincing while doing it. Compare with Dixie Chene’s effort of being Sennett’s ‘new’ Mabel in Their Social Splash. She’s very unconvincing (but star material nevertheless). It was Mabel’s eventual aim to combine tragedy with comedy in a unique mix. In her films, Mabel’s comedy is underplayed, subtle not broad, almost deadpan – if we remove the Sennett-induced slapstick, that is. Why didn’t Mabel kick at the traces of slapstick? Because she trusted that Sennett knew best, and the profits proved that he did. Mabel’s aim to blend comedy with tragedy was partially laid aside, until a certain Charles Spencer Chaplin came on the scene. After some early hiccups with\n\nthe egotistical Chaplin, it became clear that here was an actor Mabel could work with. Did Chaplin arrive in pictures with the seeds of tragic comedy already planted in his brain? Perhaps, but it was only following many long after-work discussions with Mabel in her bungalow dressing room that the features of his later films began to gel. The pair’s seminal movie in this vein was, surprisingly enough, Mabel’s Busy Day. Slammed back in the day for its gratuitous violence, it is, nonetheless, a film of deep tragedy, with some, albeit short, moments of tenderness. Why there was so much ass-kicking and knife-waving incorporated into the film it is difficult to determine, but it may be that Sennett, by allowing a little tragedy, had to proportionately increase the violence (keep the punters happy, you know). The tragic figure here is not Chaplin, it is Mabel, the poor tramp-like street-vending girl, sent out to earn a living selling hot-dogs (or sausages, as she calls out). With tattered skirt, ill-fitting boddice, and shoes larger than any tramp’s, she cuts a most pitiable figure. However, like an Irish coster-girl from the streets of Olde London Town, Mabel trucks no nonsense, and kicks, punches, and tries to stab the wise-guy Chaplin, who steals her sausages. As in The Mender of Nets, Mabel scares the daylights out of the extras, when she runs amok with a large knife. Of course, Mabel was equally scary in Mabel’s Dramatic Career (you upset a colleen at your peril).\n\nBeyond Biograph, Mabel was given solid foundations by Mack Sennett, and Mabel trusted her career and life to him. So said close friend Adela Rogers St. Johns, who claimed Mack protected her from the world, and Adela was most upset when they didn’t marry. She blames all Mabel’s subsequent troubles on the split with Sennett, and implies that The King of Comedy had safeguarded her until that time. Adela claimed Mabel was one of the elves, that she fell in love with a mortal, Mack Sennett, who built The World of Make-Believe around her in Edendale . When the split (whatever the reason) came, Mabel fell apart. Said Adela:\n\n“When tragedy hits clowns, they are bewildered by it, I think. Like fairies they die when they encounter the cruelty of mortals.”\n\nOf course, there are no elves, nor fairies, but we have to accept that Mabel, sweet and fair, became Madcap Mabel from the fatal day in 1915, when Mack and Mabel became no more. From that time on she involved herself in a continuous series of love triangles, jabbered nonsense constantly, drank excessively, and became, apparently, completely ‘unhinged’. If the Sennett split came about due to another woman, then we might suspect that Mabel became a sort of Miss Havisham in reverse, punishing other women for what another actress had done to her. Her means of punishment seems to have been achieved by getting between a woman and her man. Tragedy was the result in the Taylor and Dines affairs, and the other women involved were destroyed professionally. Did Mabel resent Pickford-lookalike Mary Miles Minter and Edna Purviance? MMM seemed to get everything she wanted (spoiled?), while Edna was in a place where Mabel should have been. Edna became Chaplin’s long-term sidekick, something Mabel was unable to do anything about, except vent her fury at Charlie, every time she saw him, with the words:\n\n“Charlie! I will be your leading lady – one day!”\n\nOnce Mabel had been scorned she never forgave. When Edna Purviance became close to a millionaire, Courtland Dines, Mabel made a play for him. In Mabel’s mind, Edna, by securing Chaplin, had enough in her life. Why should she also have the wealthy oilman, especially as Mabel had (she thought) reached the end of her lucrative career? It may not be a coincidence that Dines was shot by Mabel’s chauffeur, at precisely the time when Purviance and Dines were considering marriage. Details of the events that night are confused. Did Mabel order her driver to shoot Dines? Did she, in fact, pull the trigger herself? Either way, the romance between Dines and Purviance ended at this point. While Edna was distraught, Mabel seemed happy and even a little cocky. Job done.\n\nContrary to what Mabel had thought, at the time of the Dines affair, she went on to earn a good deal of money over the next few years. Her film, The Extra Girl made a huge amount of cash, from which Mabel drew around a million dollars. She then went on to make a further million from an aborted stage show. As already related, she managed to get Phyllis Haver fired from The Extra Girl and get herself put into the star role. Later, she somehow persuaded friends to push Hal Roach into hiring her. Roach was not keen on this, and was even less keen once Mabel started her usual antics around the studio.\n\nMabel’s increasing illness, and eventual death, relieved Hal Roach of any more stress and angst at the tongue of the irreverent ex-Keystone Girl. However, Mabel’s death on 23 February 1930 defined something of historical importance. It was clear to every reporter attending Mabel’s funeral that the era of silent movies had now passed, never to return. The gray and balding movie moguls that conveyed Mabel to her grave, were undoubtedly aware that this was indeed the case [Footnote].\n\nSumming Mabel Up.\n\nCan we really get to know Mabel as she really was? The Keystone Girl (as she will be eternally known) was (is) the most written about actress in the history of the movies. For all this, it almost impossible to get a handle on her personality. Like a will o’ the wisp or a pixie, just when you think you have a hold on her, she simply disappears into the ether. Adela Rogers St. John tried understand her, Charlie Chaplin tried to understand her, as did Minta Durfee and Mack Sennett. Mack admits failure in his autobiography, and said “I cannot explain her”. Nor could he even accurately describe her.\n\nPreviously, when he opened the Mabel Normand Sound Stage, he had said Mabel was “Just a little girl with a golden heart”. This may explain why she was so loved by her peers, a little clown that was ‘generous to a fault’. Beyond this Mabel was tough, even ruthless, and is able to reach out to us, even from the grave. At least two people, who had known Mabel in life, made their homes a shrine to the little clown. One was brother Claude, who eventually took his own life, overawed by the tragedy of his sister’s life and death. In a blind fury his wife tried to destroy Mabel’s memory by burning all of her surviving possessions, but much was saved, including the life-sized painting of ‘Mickey’. Marilyn Slater, the adopted child of Mabel’s nurse, Julia Benson, left home, sick to death of her guardian’s obsession with the silent movie queen. Marilyn Slater now runs the biggest site to Mabel on the internet – it seems Mabel has reached out yet again. Nobody alive today knew Mabel, but Marilyn knew, not only Julia Benson, but Mack Sennett, who, for a time, made frequent visits to the Benson household. Stephen Normand, grandson of Mabel’s brother Claude, knew his grandmother, Claude’s wife (Mabel’s mother passed on in 1932, it is said, from a broken heart). Importantly, he knew Mabel’s sister, Gladys, but he has never revealed what she told him. He noted that Gladys was formidable, and seemed much tougher than Mabel. However, it seems unlikely that Gladys differed much from Mabel, the difference being the environments in which they lived. Mabel had to be sweetness personified, but underneath was as tough and as willful as an Irish blacksmith. As Chaplin noted in 1930:\n\n“She was a gallant fighter”\n\nWhen we see Mabel tripping across the screen with all the innocence and gaiety of an ingenue, we have to remember that she stormed through life, as though wearing diver’s boots. This, then, was the real tragedy of Mabel Normand.\n\nIf I have failed to characterize Mabel, then I am not alone. No-one ever managed to put Mabel into a category during her lifetime, and it is unlikely that anyone ever will. She was simply unique, and lived and died, during a unique time.\n\nFootnote: The last big silent film was City Lights, released by Charlie Chaplin in 1930, but begun in 1928."
