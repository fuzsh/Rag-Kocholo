        "text": "I can hardly believe it's been 25 years already.\n\nLittle Burkittsville, just over the Frederick County line, became an unwitting, and perhaps unwilling, focus of attention as the setting for the most popular horror flick of the summer.\n\nMy colleague Tim Rowland remarked at the time that Burkittsville might be sitting on a tourism goldmine as a result of the film's success, even suggesting souvenir bumper stickers squealing \"I'm melting! I'm melting! In Burkittsville, Md.\"\n\nI saw the film in a theater in Charleston, S.C., while visiting my brother and sister-in-law (and the beach at Isle of Palms), and found the ending just jarring enough to keep me awake and staring into the darkness for a while that night.\n\nBut what was truly unnerving was another relative's obsession with it — and his insistence that it was real.\n\nHe'd fallen for the producers' hype of the \"documentary,\" which was purely designed to get movie-goers to fork over their $5 (again, it was 25 years ago) and shiver over their popcorn while the three hapless 20-somethings in the film wandered into places they shouldn't oughta been.\n\nAnd the hype worked — The Blair Witch Project posted, according to the International Movie Database, the 10th highest domestic box office take for 1999. Not bad for an effort that cost south of $60,000 to make.\n\nNothing I could say (no, there is no legend of a Blair Witch who murders children; no, there weren't any missing students in '94; no, Burkittsville was never called \"Blair\" — no, listen, I live 20 miles away. It didn't happen) could dissuade him. He was thoroughly convinced those kids had disappeared making that \"documentary.\"\n\nI finally gave up. He chose to believe it; therefore it became his reality. Never mind that the actors were alive and well and working on other projects, or that most of the film was shot in other counties (that closing scene that gave me the creeps? It was shot more than 50 miles from Burkittsville, in Baltimore County). He'd seen all the marketing propaganda and it looked real to him, and that was that.\n\nAnd this was before anyone concocted the truly bewitching echo chamber of social media. These days, if you read it on The App Formerly Known as Twitter, it must be so, right?\n\nFast-forward to this summer. Somewhat lost between the presidential race and the Olympic games, a truly horrific story has been unfolding in Britain, and unlike the Blair Witch Project, it is only too real.\n\nIt began when a group of excited children gathered late last month for a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in a seaside town. They were going to learn some yoga, make bracelets and — of course — dance to a little Tay-Tay.\n\nToward the end of the class, a knife-wielding youth arrived at the building and went on a rampage. By the time it was over, three little girls — aged 6, 7 and 9 — were dead, and eight more children and two adults were injured; several critically.\n\nThe police immediately nabbed the 17-year-old suspect. He's been charged with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder. But that's not the end of the story.\n\nA rumor started that the suspect was an undocumented immigrant. Other rumors accused people who were not suspects.\n\nThe rumors erupted on social media and led to a series of violent riots that spread to municipalities across Britain, even across the Irish Sea to Belfast. Rioters injured scores of police officers and damaged vehicles, mosques, convenience stores and hotels that were housing asylum-seekers.\n\nThe misinformation caused so much violence that a judge took the unusual step, according to the Associated Press, of identifying the teen-aged suspect. He is of Rwandan descent and has, for Britain, an unusual surname.\n\nBut he was not born in Rwanda. He is a natural British citizen with an ethnic name.\n\nAnd he was born in Cardiff. In Wales.\n\nThree little girls gone, eight more hurt and two adults critically injured — apparently trying to defend the children — was tragedy enough. A week of additional violence, fanned by outright lies on social media, only compounded the grief for those families as the murders were exploited to target people who had nothing whatever to do with the attack.\n\nDon't fall under the spell of social media; be careful what you believe. And be careful what you post.\n\nAnd if you are a parent, teach your children to be careful, too.\n\nAnd if like me you claim to be a Christian, but you post or re-post things you haven't verified, be reminded of what Jesus said about liars, lies and the father of it (John 8:44). Do we think he doesn't mind us spreading lies just because we post something we want to believe and assume is true, but we can't be bothered to find out whether it really is?\n\nWe'd all do much better to just stop with the nasty, accusatory posts. In his letter to the church at Philippi, St. Paul offers practical guidance:\n\n\"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent or praiseworthy — think (and post … ?) about such things.\"\n\nThat's good advice whatever form your spirituality might take, as the people of Britain proved this week. Because there's an addendum to their story.\n\nThousands of police were deployed Wednesday as the country braced for another night of violence. Early morning raids were conducted at the homes of known rioters. Venerable actor Michael Caine issued a two-word plea: \"Calm down.\"\n\nBut then something interesting happened. Thousands of Britons decided they simply weren't having it.\n\nThey gathered in peaceful counter-demonstrations across the country, in cities where more riots were anticipated. In London, according to BBC, they chanted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" The Independent published photos of Derby streets lined with people holding signs proclaiming \"Love Not Hate,\" and in Birmingham, \"Stop the scapegoating.\"\n\nFor the most part Wednesday, the rioters disappeared.\n\nEvery summer, I kind of wish I could be 13-going-on-14 all over again\n\nIs it over? Probably not; officials were anticipating more problems, and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer was conducting emergency meetings to deal with them.\n\nBut the counter-demonstrators' position is perhaps instructive for our own country in a volatile political year — and even for Hagerstown in this high-temperature summer of angst.\n\nWhatever is true.\n\nWhatever is noble.\n\nWhatever is right.\n\nWhatever is pure.\n\nWhatever is lovely.\n\nWhatever is admirable.\n\nIf anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about those things."
