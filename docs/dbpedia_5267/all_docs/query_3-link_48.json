        "text": "BREWSTER — \"Mack & Mabel\" may be live theater, but it begins with a movie.\n\nUsing silent-film style credits projected on a screen to give quick background on this based-on-life story is an ideal opener. The Jerry Herman musical, and what happens to its characters, is all about movie-making, and the small Tinseltown touches are just one of many things that make this Cape Rep Theatre production special.\n\nThe camera on a tripod that someone just keeps cranking, the funny props like a horseless saddle on a lever and cactus cut-outs for a Western, the frantic pace for chases and costume changes, the crazy outfits and over-sized mustaches, the clips of real silent films — director Peter Hackett gets the details just right and has his terrific cast moving like clockwork through it all.\n\nThe chaos of making a dozen short movies a week in the early 20th century in \"Mack & Mabel\" surrounds what is part love story, part film-history lesson, and it's all set to a wonderful score brought lushly to life by musical director Scott Storr. At the center is Mack Sennett, the King of Comedy and mastermind of the Keystone Cops, and the nobody he turned into his star, Mabel Normand. The story of their careers and their tempestuous relationship is a moving one, and while it's unevenly told around Herman's terrific songs, stars Richard Sullivan and particularly Christina Morrell pull you in and pull this all off.\n\nSullivan projects bluster and cynicism as the demanding, work-obsessed Sennett. Yet he endearingly shows the director's softer side when it comes to the outspoken sandwich-delivery girl who walked on to a movie set one day and charmed him — and then movie audiences everywhere. Sullivan creates an easygoing, accessible narrator, showing, with sure vocals and warm delivery, both delight and regret in how the relationship played out. He knows he's selfish and tells Mabel he can't meet her expectations (the lovely \"I Won't Send Roses\") but neither heed that warning.\n\nMorrell glows from her first scene. Her Mabel is lovable and funny: vulnerable and starry-eyed when it comes to Sennett, yet broadly comic and nimble enough to wow an insatiable movie audience. Morrell's singing voice and delivery more than do justice to some of the best songs — \"Time Heals Everything,\" \"Wherever He Ain't\" — and how she transforms from mouse to star in \"Look What Happened to Mabel\" is infectious.\n\nThe two are backed by an ensemble of 10 who provide such strong backup and indelible characters that, even in choreographer Keith Coughlin's sparkling \"big\" numbers, they make it feel like there are far more people in the cast. All are excellent, but Serena Brook stands out as actress/dancer/voice of reason Lottie, as does Jared Hagen as the broadly comic Fatty Arbuckle.\n\nDespite its beloved score, 1974's \"Mack & Mabel\" was a flop for the celebrated writer of \"Hello, Dolly!\" and the musical's troubled history is usually linked to Michael Stewart's book. It's been revised over the years, but the book still doesn't completely work, struggling with the balance between the comedy of Sennett's movies and the dark, incompletely told story of Mabel's downfall. Sennett's motivation flip-flops in the on-again-off-again relationship — he goes to great lengths to win Mabel back, then twice changes his mind on a dime and is inexplicably willing to walk away. Mabel's final struggles seem to come out of nowhere for someone who doesn't know how this story ends.\n\nYet Sennett voices what we've all thought at one time or another — \"if only life were a movie\" — and the fact that the great director's final number is named \"Happy Ending\" gives a hint of whether light or dark wins out in this version.\n\nThe Hollywood events of \"Mack & Mabel\" happened a century ago, but perhaps the success of last year's film \"The Artist\" will make some of the old-movie themes resonate more with audiences used to superhero blockbusters. And if you're already a film buff, this slice of history — so well-produced by Cape Rep — is a treat. How often do you get to see an actor upstaged by a giant Charlie Chaplin?\n\nWhat: \"Mack & Mabel\" Written by: Michael Stewart with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman Presented by: Cape Rep Theatre When: 7 p.m. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays through Oct. 21 Where: Cape Rep's Indoor Theatre, off Route 6A, Brewster Tickets: $30 Reservations: 508-896-1888 or www.caperep.org\n\nON STAGE"
