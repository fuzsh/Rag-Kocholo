        "text": "Outside of silent film aficionados, few people have ever heard of Mabel Normand, one of Hollywood’s earliest comedy greats. Mabel’s films introduced the Keystone Cops, Charlie Chaplin’s little tramp character, and the classic if now cliche pie-in-the-face bit.\n\nMabel was the only comedian to work with all of the following superstars:\n\n*deep breath*\n\nMack Sennett(her boo), Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Hal Roach, Harold Lloyd, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, and John Bunny.\n\nWithout Mabel’s contributions, the madcap comedy of her era wouldn’t have been the same. Without her ongoing influence, movies like “There’s Something About Mary” wouldn’t exist. Although it’s been almost a century since Normand’s untimely death, she’s still with us in every great comedy movie made.\n\nMabel Normand was born in Staten Island, New York, on November 9, 1892. Her first gig was as an artist model for the creator of the Gibson Girl, Charles Dana Gibson.\n\nThe popularity of the “flickers” was growing, and some of Mabel’s friends encouraged her to give film a go. She began her movie star odyssey as an extra in Kalem and Biograph shorts."
