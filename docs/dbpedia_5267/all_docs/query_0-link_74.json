        "text": "I *nearly* booked more expensive flights and accommodation which would have been DIRECT flights and INCREDIBLY central location and flying at very comfortable hours. Instead I’m flying to Frankfurt at 6 a.m. and then on to Bologna and staying 18 minutes away from most venues, not so ideal. But really cheap — because it was a last-minute deal, I have an entire apartment to myself and it’s all at pre-Covid prices. Which is psychologically important as I haven’t been to Bologna since Covid. This makes it less of a shock.\n\nI’ll arrive mid-afternoon on Monday, and since Il Cinema Ritrovato now has a booking system where you have to decide in advance what you’re going to see (though you can change your mind subject to availability) I can tell you that I intend watching Carlo Rim’s L’ARMOIRE VOLONTE and Harry Kümel’s MALPERTUIS on my first day. Rim is the screenwriter of the wartime Maigret films which I enjoyed a lot, and his cupboard film stars Fernandel. Weird circumstances have caused me never to have seen MALPERTUIS but its reverie haunts my memory. As a kid I caught ten minutes or so on late-night TV and was alternately lured (Magritte title sequence!) and repelled (awkward dubbing!) but I know I’m going to love it this time. Unless fate intervenes again and I fall asleep in an overheated cinema.\n\nI like the synchronicity of a Maigret-Magritte connection, the surrealist painter and the creator of the French detective being two of the legendary Ten Famous Belgians. Kümel is a third, depending on how you measure fame.\n\nMeanwhile, here’s D.W. Griffith’s THE LESSON from 1910. A pivotal period. I have a big post written but unpublished about Griffith’s development of a more subdued acting style. This movie is a snapshot of that process. In scene one, everyone is using delicate pantomime to make it clear what the scene is about. It’s cleverly done — their gestures are more explicit than we might expect in a real incident, but they’re in character and in the scene, so it feels like they’re being used for the benefit of the other characters, not us.\n\nThen our gesticulator-in-chief, Joseph Graybill, a lovely study in fatuous self-satisfaction, visits a bar. Griffith was almost as fond of inveighing against the demon drink as he was of the demon drink itself. Here, Graybill meets a friend — per IMDb, this seems to be Edward Dillon, Arthur V. Johnson or Charles West. I think it’s Dillon, going by the eyebrows.\n\nNothing about this man is human. His every movement feels mechanical: ball bearings are at work somewhere in him. The speed of his movements offers some simulation of humanity, but if you slow him down a little he becomes one of those arms that assembles cars. I can only assume this effect is the result of sheer hard work — he’s thought in advance about every gesture and so they emerge as a well-planned routine, with sub-routines, rather than as spontaneous life. It’s preposterous. And there’s Graybill on the other side of the screen demonstrating how it should be done.\n\nI’m morally certain that if the set walls all fell down, or the bartender spontaneously humanly combusted, or the furniture all disintegrated, this guy would carry on delivering the same performance, sitting on a chair that’s no longer there and reading a newspaper that’s ceased to exist.\n\nGriffith is so enamoured of this foolishness that he holds the scene for about a minute after his protag has staggered off, just to enjoy Dillon/Johnson/West’s unnatural mucking about.\n\nThe fact that Dillon/Johnson/West can get away with this silly performance seems like a strike against Griffith. The fact that, whichever of the three named actors this is, they were all in Griffith films for several years after, is worse. Why would you let this guy stink up your scenes? Maybe he improved, though. Some of us do.\n\nWe can even see this guy flicking his newspaper, a mannerism more usually associated with bad Shakespeare productions (i.e. Branagh). One thing you never, ever see in reality is people holding out a letter or newspaper and BATTING it with the fingers of their free hand for emphasis. And I’m prepared to lay money that no actual human in Shakespeare’s day ever did this either. If you can find a way to test this, I can collect my winnings. What makes this document-flick even more egregious is that — let’s call him Dillon — isn’t doing it for emphasis, for anyone else’s benefit. He’s just sitting reading. True, he’s drunk, but I have never seen alcohol produce either roboticism or this precise kind of rhetorical flourish.\n\nAny time you see somebody flick a document in a film, walk out. No good can come of it.\n\nIf I’m right and this is Dillon, he went on to specialise in Keystone comedies — he’s in A DASH THROUGH THE CLOUDS with Mabel Normand, for instance. Where his acting “style” would fit in pretty well. You often see actors and filmmakers left behind by developments in their field but finding modes of filmmaking which haven’t moved with the times where they can still earn a crust.\n\nDillon’s last film seems to be 1931’s odd William K. Howard SHERLOCK HOLMES. it would be interesting — very very mildly interesting — to see if his “style” has changed in twenty years. The Inaccurate Movie Database also has him down for a 2001 episode of The Prosecutors: In Pursuit of Justice, but as he’d been dead for 68 years at that point I’m going to assume that’s a mistake.\n\nHal Roach intertitles come in two forms: a sort of rough-weave hessian, and stone cladding. SHOULD MEN WALK HOME?, a 1927 Leo McCarey short, has the former. Those were apparently the two main materials made available to H.M. “Beanie” Walker, hard-working titles writer. (I doubt Walker actually ASSEMBLED the titles, but Roach’s credits are notoriously sparse and imprecise — Walker would actually be credited as “writer” on nearly all Roach productions including the talkies though often all that was left of his scripts was thosee opening cards: “Mr. Hardy believes a husband should tell his wife everything. Mr. Laurel is crazy too.”)\n\nThe above example is sotto voce, hence the tiny font.\n\nOdd cast here — Mabel Normand and Creighton Hale as leads, though both had been headlining features recently. They play debonair crooks, a little like Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins in TROUBLE IN PARADISE. Eugene Pallette is the detective, undercover to protect a society party. Oliver Hardy is a guest. Edgar Dearing, a real-life motorcycle cop, plays a motorcycle cop, as he does in almost everything ever made.\n\nMcCarey is doing the slower, reaction-heavy kind of comedy he’d impose on Laurel & Hardy at around this same time, which lends credence to his claim to be responsible for that. McCarey, classic Hollywood type, liked to claim credit for everything, including Babe Hardy’s nickname, which history tells us came from an Italian barber.\n\nThere’s a brief who’s-following-who routine, and then a corridor bit with Hale and Normand dashing across frame to the startlement of the stalking ‘tec. Lots of visual imagination and nice composition.\n\nHale hasn’t got the horn-rimmed glasses he adopted for the same year’s THE CAT AND THE CANARY (borrowed from Henry Hull’s in the stage production) which he’d retain for several films. He’s being used as a handsome leading man type, and he can almost sort of pull this off, which is a surprise to those of us who know him mainly as pasty types sick with fear.\n\nAnother whispered sack-cloth intertitle.\n\nMabel of course is a delight, and it’s nice to see her in something more attentive to nuances of performance. And in a flapper dress rather than the hideous fashions of the teen years.\n\nGood use of a mirror, though nothing compared to McCarey’s later mirror scene in the Marx bros’ DUCK SOUP (itself borrowed from Charley Chase at Roach, who got it from Max Linder). But it gets into similar craziness — Pallette, having spotted Hale’s attempt to brain him with a vase, goes along with Hale’s improvisation, where he pretends to have merely been admiring the ceramics. So they both know what they know, and they’re both pretending otherwise — for whose benefit?\n\nThere are bits of business here that haven’t been copied a thousand times. When Mabel gets her hand caught in another vase, which contains the MacGuffin, Hale tries to free her, using a curtained doorway to disguise this. Mabel has to play a scene with Pallette while being violently jerked about by her concealed arm. It’s new! Exciting! Different!\n\nHale later does some impressive underwater acting. In fact, he might be the best underwater actor I’ve ever seen, he does it without aid of aqualung or snorkel. Being submerged makes him even more himself — chalk-white and puffy and diffuse-looking.\n\nThe next gag, with Hale impersonating a stone fountainhead which just happens to look approximately like him, would be appropriate by Laurel and Hardy the following year in EARLY TO BED. It makes more sense there (Ollie’s fountainheads resemble Ollie) but is funnier here, I think. Really good work by Hale (Messerschmidt head-like facial contortion) and Pallette (his trademark narrow-eyed suspicion). Again, comparable to the famous mirror routine, as suspicion resists all invitation to evolve into certainty.\n\nThis is certainly the funniest I’ve seen Hale: he’s trying to maintain a grimace (the character) and trying not to laugh (the actor), and this is somehow acceptable within the scene’s cinematic diegesis, if diegesis is the word I want. Through the miracle of editing he is always somehow able to come up with more water to squirt, though where it’s coming from once he initially runs out is a question best left to the rogue biologists out there.\n\nWhen Ollie turns up — after the stolen gem has been dropped in the punchbowl — he has startlingly close-cropped hair. It must be just growing back from THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS, for which he and Stan shaved their heads to play convicts (an unusual bit of realism — neither Keaton nor Chaplin bothered with prison haircuts when they played inmates or escapees). This led to Stan’s hair growing back all tufty, and the rest is history.\n\nOllie’s character is rich and snooty, rather different from his usual self. It’s also very funny to see the smaller Hale DOMINATE Ollie by force of personality. It’s such violation of drawing-room comedy behaviour, Ollie doesn’t know how to react.\n\nThe final gag does not seem particularly original after almost a hundred years, but it’s a perfectly serviceable topper. Fun!\n\nOne last jaunt into Echo Lake Park, AKA the violently inclined idiot’s Forest of Arden.\n\nCharlie is married to Phyllis Allen, Keystone’s own Marie-Dressler-Alike. It’s a seaside postcard marriage, the big, domineering woman and the henpecked little man. Phyllis has the sniffles, and Charlie, rather than being sympathetic, is mocking her for our benefit: he does a trombone mime, and pretends to blow his nose on her knitting.\n\nWikipedia informs us that the character names this time are Mr. and Mrs. Sniffels — possibly a Sydney Chaplin interpolation, as he rewrote the text and recut the action in much of his brother’s Keystone output at a later date.\n\nMeanwhile (there are several meanwhiles in this) MABEL, we are told, ADMIRES HER HUSBAND AMBROSE. An extraordinary statement. Ambrose, of course, is Mack Swain, and there’s admittedly plenty of him to admire. Wires have not become crossed yet, but the mere introduction of wiring to a Keystone short promises that this will happen. 1914 audiences would be chuckling in anticipation.\n\nA motor car enters frame. Mack & Mabel are enchanted by the gasoline-driven chariot. Their faces light up with religious awe. OK, so Chaplin needed to introduce an auto, and had to find a way to make it interesting (ignoring Sidney Pollack’s dictum, for the good reason that it hadn’t yet been formulated — Pollack wouldn’t be born for twenty years yet — “Let the boring crap BE boring crap”) so he has his lovers ooh and ahh at the mundane jalopy as if it were Hitler flying in at the start of TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Instead, its someone called Joe Bordeaux and his crate promptly breaks down. Ambrose gets distracted trying to help, and Mabel is left alone…\n\nA meting between Charlie and Mabel is now anticipated, but Chaplin pulls a fast one, instead he introduces a whole new character, “Mary, the flirt” per Wikipedia, played by the fetching Cecile Arnold. On seeing her, Charlie/Mr. Sniffels immediately distances himself from his slumbering spouse. Adultery, or anyhow a flirtery, is on the cards.\n\n“It’s the story of a girl who is searching… searching… SEARCHING!” as Jerry Lewis will say in HOLLYWOOD OR BUST. Can Charlie help? HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED!\n\nScanning the area for whatever MacGuffin Cecile is hunting, Charlie’s eyes alight on her bottom as she bends to examine the lawn. A quick display of beaming innocence is produced when she catches him at it.\n\nCharlie prowls after Cecile, leaving the snoozing Phyllis. It’s a little strange that he’s dressed as a tramp in this one, since his wife is clearly not indigent. Indignant, yes. But Charlie’s costume is now firmly established. It’s taken most of a year.\n\nThe plot is now thickened in a startling fashion as Glen Cavender abruptly appears, dragged up as some kind of dagger-wielding Turk in a fez. Cecile is with him, apparently. He stabs Charlie Sniffels in the arse, and that’s that dealt with. Charlie makes his unheard excuses and leaves.\n\nFleeing the dread Turk, Charlie now discovers Mabel, still waiting alone as Ambrose struggles to crank the stalled automobile, his capacious buttocks thrusting rhythmically upwards in a grotesque parody of the sexual act. Can someone recut Cronenberg’s CRASH, Guy Grand style, so that the characters are watching this on TV?\n\nChaplin is now composing in depth in a way that greatly enhances the visual interest.\n\nThe late John Belushi contrived to meet his wife by hitting her on the arm with an oar. Here, Sniffels, having tidied himself up a bit (a rare moment of near-pathos), thwacks Mabel across the rump with his cane — it’s up to us to decide if it’s deliberate — and then apologises. An introduction is made. Well, it’s one way of doing it.\n\nPicking an imaginary thread from Mabel’s shoulder, Charlie demonstrates how pantomime may be used to further the gentlemanly art of bothering women. And gets a slap in the face. Things are going great.\n\nCharlie inadvertently — it seems — hooks Mabel’s hem and lifts her skirt to expose a shapely ankle. In response to her outrage, he sternly spanks the crook of his cane, a fresh image, startling in its implications.\n\nMabel is outraged by all this. Charlie keeps trying to get fresh, and gets another slap. His character really is a repulsive little sex pest at this point. Ambrose has given up trying to crank that jalopy and comes to defend his wife’s honour. Except he’s too busy “getting acquainted” with Charlie — a new friend! — to listen to his wife’s complaints. So he leaves them together and returns to his solo cranking activities, a contented cuckold. He gets the car going and is offered a lift, leaving Mabel with the creepy little guy in the derby. This is getting kind of distressing.\n\nEdgar Kennedy gets a laugh! Mabel called “Help!” and Edgar the brushy-moustached kop BOUNDS into shot. Not her shot — he’s just one shot to the right.\n\nIt’s funny because it feels like he’s just been waiting, coiled, in an unseen third shot just to the right of the one he springs into.\n\nThen, defying the Kuleshovian imaginary geography that has us expecting him to cross into Mabel’s frame from screen right, he emerges in the background behind Charlie (more depth staging) so we can have British pantomime “He’s behind you!” poignancy/dramatic irony. Chaplin, the master of suspense.\n\nMabel now relaxes, encourages Charlie to incriminate himself, as Kennedy hovers menacingly behind him with truncheon erect and wagging. Charlie is overjoyed by Mabel’s new smiling responses. His quaint blandishments have borne sexy fruit. They always yield in the end! Very good slow burn response to the truncheon and then its owner. Kennedy is not only a slow-burner himself, but the cause of slow-burning in others.\n\nThey’re off! Konstable Kennedy pursues Charlie like an eager dog, lolloping round the bushes… Charlie indulges in some purely-for-fun buttock-piercing with a pin, even though this gains him nothing. But when a foe presents his backside, you have to either boot it or jab it with something sharp. Them’s the rules.\n\nThe chase circles dizzyingly around Mabel, with Charlie pausing to raise his derby — he is, after all, a gentleman, albeit a sleazy one —\n\nThis plot needs added astringency, so Ambrose dismounts the jalopy a mere shot away from Phyllis, now awake and back to her knitting. He drops his kerchief at her feet, accidentally. But now this is a tricky situation. Phyllis assumes this was a deliberate act, designed to allow him to check out her ankles. Embarrassing. And so much psychology going on in a plain americain wide shot. These wraiths of 106 years ago are still thinking thoughts and beaming them into our eyeballs as if we were all there, in the shade of a Los Angeles recreation area, two pandemics ago.\n\nAmbrose inexplicably exacerbates his blunder by sitting down next to Phyllis, while a random dog photobombs the cast.\n\nEvading the Kop, Charlie backs into the Turk, who then takes a mis-aimed blow to the fez from Kennedy’s truncheon.\n\nAll men are sexual nuisances, part 2: Mack is now pinching Phyllis’s cheek and capering on in nonconsensual fashion. The difference between Phyllis and Mabel is that when Phyllis hauls off and slaps you, you stay slapped. Now she’s yelling for a cop and Mack is reduced to a pitiful, whining schoolboy begging her not to get him in trouble.\n\nEyeline trouble. With all these tangled plot threads, it’s not too surprising when Kennedy exits Mack’s frame screen left and then arrives in Phyllis’s frame left, a feat requiring either a single-frame spin by the character or by the viewer’s brain. Still, Phyllis is able to sic Kennedy on Swain, and now both he and Charlie are fugitives from erotic justice.\n\nAmbrose collides with the Turk, who again receives an accidental thwack from Kennedy. It’s called a night stick because it makes you see stars. Kennedy, realising he’s concussed a Turk by mistake, wallops him again on purpose just for being foreign.\n\nMabel meets Phyllis, and the #MeToo movement is born.\n\nThe Charlie blunders upon the scene and, after some more suspense, is presented to Phyliis’s new bosom buddy. Shock! Charlie goes weak at the knees. Then, luckily for him, some footage goes missing and when we rejoin the scene, Phyllis has been abstracted by Melesian jump-cut. Charlie runs off, and Mabel is alone at last.\n\nKennedy is still chasing Ambrose and thumping the poor Turk, if that’s what he is. Charlie has rejoined his wife and inexplicably (and disappointingly) escaped dismemberment at her hands. But now Kennedy has located Charlie. More dramatic irony type panto suspense — Chaplin’s favourite device here, along with the in-depth framing he’s discovered.\n\nThe runing about is getting repetitive but when Mabel introduces Ambrose to Phyllis, reprising the earlier meet-uncute that got Charlie in hot water, the device works nicely, building on our anticipation. And hopefully there won’t be any lost frames this time so we’ll see what happens. Not than much, actually. And we’re back to running and cowering in bushes. It’s looking like Mabel might go off with the big woman, as she just had in TILLIE’S PUCTURED ROMANCE, for sapphic consolation. Will Charlie and Ambrose do likewise? But first, Kennedy’s kosh at last finds its mark, clobbering each cranium, and the creeps are collared.\n\nBut before the can be konfined in klink, their wronged women plead piteously on their behalf. Kennedy is confused by the discovery that the woman molested by masher #1 is married to masher #2 who is married to the woman molested by masher #1. His brain is going in circles. He storms off to beat the shit out of Henry McCoy, who was there at the start as leading man in Chaplin’s MAKING A LIVING and is here again, bothering another lovely in another part of the park. THWACK! Ouch!\n\nRealizing their lucky escape, the foursome congratulate one another (?) and the thing more of less stops. An above-average park romp that does show Chaplin developing some new visual ideas."
