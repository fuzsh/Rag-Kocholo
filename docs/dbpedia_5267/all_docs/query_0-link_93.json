        "text": "SOME musicals make it instantly, and then one wonders why. Others, like ''Mack and Mabel,'' do not, and that is a wonder, too.\n\nBut, then, straight plays as diverse as ''The Iceman Cometh'' and ''Little Murders'' had to wait their turn -and the right timing and production - to take their proper place in theatrical history after first flopping.\n\nAnd how ''Mack and Mabel,'' which came to Broadway in 1974, flopped! No, it was not one of those one-night stands, but considering that this was a David Merrick production, that Gower Champion staged and choreographed it and that Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters were the stars, a mere 66-performance run, after five previews, was something of a shock.\n\nNow, thanks to an intimate production at the new Lanark Inn Dinner-Theater here, ''Mack and Mabel'' can be re-evaluated on content alone.\n\nForget about style, glitzy production values, splashy sets and costumes and star turns. The show here is somewhat shortened from the original, or so it seems, but it's a winner.\n\nOne of the real problems with ''Mack and Mabel'' - and it is a problem that still needs to be worked on, especially if the show is to have a deserved second life - is Michael Stewart's most problematic book.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
