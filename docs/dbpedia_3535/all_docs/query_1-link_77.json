        "text": "(Fox Home Video, $59.98)\n\nI hadn’t thought about the Charlie Chan movies in years. But last week Fox sent the first in what apparently is a series of Chan box sets so it was time to take a new look. These “B” movies were derived from a popular series of novels by Earl Derr Biggers, who based the Chan character on Chang Apana, a noted Chinese-Hawaiian police detective who worked in Honolulu. Fox restored the films a few years ago, planning to show them on its Fox Movie Channel, but protests from Asian-American groups put a halt to those plans. Now four early Chan films from 1934-35 (“Charlie Chan in London,” “… in Paris,” “… in Egypt,” “… in Shanghai”) have arrived on DVD.\n\nChan is played by Swedish-born actor Warner Oland, reflecting the then-common Hollywood belief that an Asian actor couldn’t carry a lead role (in movies, Chan was always played by white actors, though his sons were played by Asians). Today, of course, having a Caucasian actor playing an Asian wouldn’t even be considered. Even worse, “Charlie Chan in Egypt” features black actor Stepin Fetchit, whose performances embodied some of the most negative stereotypes of African-Americans and are difficult to watch today. (That film also features a pre-stardom Rita Hayworth – billed as Rita Cansino – as the most beautiful housemaid you’ve ever seen.)\n\nMore interesting in some ways than the movies themselves are the bonus features, which look at Apana, Biggers and the development of the Chan character. Ironically, Biggers created Chan in the 1920s to counter hateful “yellow peril” stereotypes of Asians and gave him his trademark superior intelligence and politeness as positive attributes. Today those very attributes as portrayed in the Chan films can be seen as negative stereotypes. Taken as a whole, though, this box set offers some perspective and is an interesting look at Hollywood and American cultural history."
