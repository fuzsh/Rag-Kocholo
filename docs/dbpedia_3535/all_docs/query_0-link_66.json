        "text": "Terms: Race/ethnicity: Two concepts often linked. It is often thought that race deals with a biological idea and ethnicity with a cultural one, although in fact this is not quite true. Race is technically, a small inbreeding population with a species and the word subspecies or variety may be used in its place. Race is often thought to be a cultural categorization of people based on a perceived biological condition, whereas ethnicity is used for an affiliation or identity with a cultural non biological group.\n\nSex/gender: Similar in many ways to race/ethnicity in that Sex is often seen as biological and gender as identity.\n\nColor blind casting: The concept of casting a play, film, opera without regard to the performers race.\n\nStereotyping: The idea that all people of a certain type behave in some typical way which may or may not accurately describe the situation.\n\nLearned vs. innate: concepts have to do with whether people have acquired (learned) some trait, or whether it is hard wired into the system. Biological traits like hair color etc., are often commonly thought of as genetic, whereas behavior is generally held to be learned. This is often a hotly debated issue, and reflects upon the western pattern of conflict between free will and determinism. Similar problems exist with sex/gender and race/ethnicity above. Remember discussions from Bad Seed.\n\nBefore the Film\n\nThe Charlie Chan series is based on stories by Earl Derr Biggs, which in turn are based on the exploits of a real Chinese detective on the Honolulu Police Department named Chang Apana.\n\nThere are a number of other Asian characters like Fu Manchu who regularly turn up in the films of the 1930s and 1940s just prior to and during World War II who are generally the evil character in them. Chinese and Japanese, being hard for Americans to distinguish, were by actor interchangeable in films. During the war almost all Japanese in films were portrayed by Chinese or Chinese-American actors.\n\nCharlie Chan was a notable exception to the rule of the evil Asian. An intellectually bright and highly logical detective, he was clearly a match for Sherlock Holmes in 45 movies made in the 18 years from 1931 to 1949. his brilliant investigative techniques were sought after by many police force, and in general, the police were often pleased to have him on the case. In some cases buffoon police showed obviously racial prejudice, but then  they were the buffoons.\n\nPerversely though, with all the Chinese and Chinese-American actors around, none were used to play Charlie himself, but rather Warner Oland (a Swedish born actor who played not only Charlie Chan in 16 films from 1931-1937, but Fu Manchu and several other Asians). Sidney Toler took over and from 1938-1946 played the role in 22 films and Roland Winters played the role in 7 films from 1947-1949. All of these played the lead role, in what has come to be known as Yellow Face (a parallel to Black Face). In one later film, Peter Ustinov over a flurry of controversy was selected to play Charlie in his last incarnation. Two TV Charlies also existed, and were played by character actors J. Carroll Naish (who also played the title role an Life with Luigi about an Italian immigrant and his adventures in America) and Ross Martin (from Wild Wild West). All the supporting Chinese in the films were played by Chinese and Chinese Americans.\n\nMr. Moto, another Asian detective, albeit Japanese) was played by Peter Lorre and in fact, one proposed Chan film Charlie Chan at Ringside becameMr. Motos Gamble when Oland couldnt handle the role because of a drinking problem. (Lorre had already played Mr. Moto in Thank You Mr. Moto).Mr. Moto became sufficiently popular that Lorre made five more Mr. Moto films (Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Mr. Moto in Danger Island (1939), Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938) and Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938)\n\nCharlie Chan films were very popular and were made initially by Fox studios and later Monogram.\n\nThe House Without a Key George Kuwa 1925 Pathe The Chinese Parrot Sojin Kamayama 1927 Pathe Behind that CurtainE.L.

Oland, who had studied Chinese culture) came under criticism for his pidgin-English dialogue which he felt was indicative a person who had to think in one language and speak in another/ His co star, Keye Luke was a staunch defender of Olands approach.\n\nThe question of a non-Asian playing an Asian in these films raises a number of issues discussed by the panel headed by George Takei (Sulu on the original Star Trek series.) which we will see after the film.\n\nAFTER THE FILM\n\nTo really deal with the question of Charlie Chan we would need to see many more of the films with the character. To deal with the depiction of Asians in films, even more. For example, Keye Luke plays a surgeon in some of the Dr. Gillespie films (Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant and Dr. Gillespie's Criminal Case), where his Asian-ness is totally irrelevant to the plot. While this was not as common as it is now, the number of Asians in films was more limited and often restricted to maids, waiters, houseboys and the like. What is strange is that as the number of Asians have increased dramatically in the US and in the acting profession, the supporting roles like the surgeon in seem to have reduced in numbers of Asians, while increasing for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\nThe questions raised by the panel can be divided into two parts: one deals with the economic impact on Asian and Asian American actors of using non Asians to play Asian parts, the other with the abilities of actors.\n\nThe first basically asserts that Asians are not chosen for leads in films ostensibly because they dont have a following and hence dont draw a crowd (the early exception being Bruce Lee, later some Asian performers like Jackie Chan, Jet Li etc. have made an impact, although earlier Nancy Kwan and Anna May Wong had achieved some reputation). This was the underlying problem with Miss Shanghai. The idea was that there are Black and Hispanic version of Shakespeare and Hello Dolly etc., but not Asian ones.\n\nThe counter argument has been that Asians dont support theater and film enough to risk major productions with Asian and Asian Americans in lead positions.\n\nThe second problems are much greater. If actors are only allowed to play the people they are then they arent actors. If they act, then they should be able to play anyone. The question is Are actors really trained to do that? Certainly not by the actors studio under Strasberg or his followers. But how much cultural training would it take - especially if the script is not written by someone very knowledgeable about the culture or from it? Are the three actors hampered by bad scripts, from which they can not escape no matter what? Could Keye Luke or Victor Sen Yung have played a good Charlie Chan with the dialog written the way it is?\n\nIf playing people from other cultures leads to stereotyping, do Chinese actors playing Japanese (or vice versa) have the same problems? Takei has himself done this in several cartoon shows\n\nYet another problem deals with the creative process and or vs. the interpretive one. The character is created first, by the author and then interpreted by the performer, who makes the character come alive. Nothing the actor does should contradict the character created by the author,\n\nIn terms of the creative process, it can be asked if a non Asian author create an genuinely Asian character? If this is NOT possible, then there is no need to worry about how the actor plays the role since it will lack reality anyway.\n\nIf it is possible, then it should be equally possible for an actor to produce a genuinely Asian performance, although it might take a great deal more time and effort (which of course was not possible with the cheap Charlie Chan movies). So we may in the case of these movies have a poorly written script with the main character portrayed by a poorly prepared actor.\n\nIs there are problem with style. Many of the early films retained some aspects of silent film (broad and not so broad) styles of acting. These have almost stereotypic forms and gestures equivalent to black/white sartorial codes in cowboy hats! There are specific gestures and such for all different kinds of people from priests to cowboys to sailors (the way they walk, the way they hold their hands etc.) None are realistic, but expected for audience to identify character. Would an Asian actor conform to the acting style or would they play out of style to be realistic. The problem is quite complex. SEE Topsey Turvey where British performers have stereotypic gestures and then imitate real Japanese women.\n\nThe next question deals with the impact of these films on the real world and inter-ethnic relations. Do people (and apparently largely children from the experiences relayed by the panel) believe the character and make fun of them? Or are the people encouraged to meet Chinese and ask questions about the family. One panel member says that in Honolulu children did come to her as a child and ask about the Chinese family, but rather imitated Charlies broken English. Does this imply that if you do depict a real family at dinner (which it does and which the panelist agrees with and says she can identify with) no one in the audience cares about this anyway.\n\nThe panel discussions\n\nNeed to divide economic problem of Asian and Asian-American actors from content of film - i.e who can play whom from who gets hired, although the two are interconnected. That is if Asians are only hired to play specifically Asian characters, then there is a question about hiring non Asians to play Asians. If Asians were hired for parts that were not specifically any particular group or another, and if there were \"all Asian\" productions of plays like \"Hello Dolly\" there could be some difference to the answer of whether non Asians should be allowed to play Asians. One might also ask, could Asian-Americans play people who are specifically NOT Asian by using \"white face\"?\n\nHoles in the film  do people wear sweaters and three piece suits in Honolulu. Unclear some photos from the time indicate suits were worn, but not sweaters. No one seems concerned however, how Charlie, who speaks broken English ever managed to pass a police exam and make it to detective! Another question about lies, deceits, goofs and so on.!\n\nThe panel comments on the fact that the children are criticized for being American which really criticizes their becoming American which the panel holds the dominant population feels they shouldnt. Should we question whether it would have been better to have them acting Chinese and not acculturating and being made fun of for holding on to their culture rather than for giving it up? Is this a question of reading in as opposed to reading out. Are Chinese-American families the only families depicted in those days in which the children are comic characters? No. Almost as standard as it is now for children to be wiser than adults, Southern police to be red necks and so on."
