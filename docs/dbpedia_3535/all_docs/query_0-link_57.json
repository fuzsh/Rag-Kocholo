For while blood runs darkly over the floors of a grand mansion, outside are the natives. They strum their guitars, and sing simple, alliterative songs to the accompaniment of the sea. Their rustic simplicity is occasionally disturbed by bathing beauties establishing alibis, but by this time Hawaii is used to almost everything. The amiable Charlie Chan rolls up his career, still proving the correctness of that old phrase by Ed Wynn. He follows clues to their ends, retains his bland manner while the lights go out and knives rattle about his head, and delivers the calm aphorisms of Earl Derr Biggers. In this latest instalment of the Chan legends he has changed not much from those which went before, and judging from the Roxy’s interest in him he has a considerable following. They seemed to approve of “The Black Camel,” although the hilarity was never out of control. Almost every one but the cameraman is involved in murder’s machinations at one time or another. There are persons married, divorced and with motives; and others only hopeful of the thing called love—and with motives. There is even a painter, living native like a character by Somerset Maugham, and servants, a seer and many vagrants of the Hawaiian shore. From this crowd Detective Chan weeds his pair of dangerous thistles. Warner Oland takes the part of Chan, and gives to the picture a good and even performance. Tarneverro—the man every one but Charlie suspects—is played by Bela Lugosi. Dorothy Revier has the rôle of Shelah Fane, one of murder’s most noted victims. Sally Eilers is Julie O’Neil. The identity of the person who put out the lights in a critical moment is not revealed, although the knife thrower confesses. Charlie Chan makes him. Murder in Hawaii.
