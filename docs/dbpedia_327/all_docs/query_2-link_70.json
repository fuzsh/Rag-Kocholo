        "text": "Caltex has been a dependable partner for generations across Australia, with the brand ready and committed to support customers, partners and suppliers in a whole new way.\n\nBacked by Chevron – one of the world’s leading energy companies with more than 70 years of history in Australia – Caltex offers its customers high-quality fuels, engine oils, lubricants and more, including the new fully adaptable StarCard fleet management system.\n\nSupporting this, Caltex is currently strengthening its distribution network, ensuring the prompt supply of products, to keep the country moving.\n\nFollowing Chevron’s acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings three years ago, which included a national network of retail locations, they’re now embarking on a rebranding project which will see most Puma Energy sites change to Caltex by the end of the year.\n\nBeyond the retail experience, Caltex offers innovative industry-leading technology, such as the specially formulated fuel system-cleaning ingredient Techron, which is available in every fuel grade — helping to deliver maximised power, better fuel economy, better acceleration, a smother drive, and reliable performance to car engines.\n\nOn the lubricants side, diesel engines will experience Caltex Delo ISOSYN Technology, the brand’s high-performance diesel engine oil offering, while Havoline will be available for petrol engines.\n\nBy offering a comprehensive fuel and lubricant offering, Caltex provides a one-stop-shop, with solutions available for every kind of application, from construction to mining, agricultural, power generation, transport, and global marine.\n\nTop-tier lubricants and fuel that keep you moving\n\nProtecting your investment in plant equipment with high-quality lubricants simply makes sense.\n\nCaltex Delo with ISOSYN Technology, helps protect vital diesel engine parts, provide engine durability and extend service intervals, to help minimise operating costs.\n\nDrawing on over 88 years of expertise, ISOSYN Technology combines premium base oils with high-performance additives to deliver engine component protection rivalling synthetics. This high-performance additive formulation helps provide exceptional soot dispersion and prevent deposit build-up, ensuring vehicle performance which can contribute to extended service intervals and minimised downtime.\n\nThe road to the modern-day Delo range is one based on marketplace innovation. In 1935, Chevron, then known as Standard Oil of California, partnered with Caterpillar Tractor (CAT) to formulate an oil to lubricate the high-speed diesel engines that CAT was planning to build.\n\nThis joint venture between the two companies resulted in a multipurpose motor oil known as Delo, an acronym for Diesel Engine Lubricating Oil.\n\nIn the 1940s, Delo was the first brand in the world to develop compound diesel engine oil that could be used in any diesel engine, and in the 1950s, it pioneered the first successful multi-grade engine oil, with innovations over the following decades setting industry benchmarks for long-term engine performance.\n\nDelo products are sold in 155 countries, and importantly, Chevron internally controls the three pieces required to manufacture lubricants, by producing its own base oil. It controls Oronite, one of the world’s biggest additive companies, while it also maintains 21 individual blending plants globally, including joint ventures.\n\nToday, the Caltex Delo product family includes lubricants, coolants, greases, and construction equipment system consumables such as engine oils, hydraulic system oil, transmission oils, engine antifreeze/coolants, gear drive fluid, grease for bearings and other lubrication points and more.\n\nSimilarly, this offering extends to all other fleet vehicles, including trucks, trailers, and passenger vehicles, with the Havoline brand of oils covering the full spectrum of petrol engines.\n\nCaltex with Techron is available across all petrol fuel grades and contains an innovative formulation that has been scientifically proven to help clean and protect engines. Techron not only removes dirt, but also helps prevent deposits from forming on critical parts of your car’s engine. This helps your car’s engine to function at optimum, delivering maximum power to your wheels.\n\nCaltex Diesel with Techron D helps keep fuel injectors clean, protect against corrosion and reduce foaming while filling up. In diesel engines, the fuel injector nozzle can be as narrow as the width of two human hairs, and with these injectors usually located inside the combustion chamber, they are exposed to extreme heat, and are, therefore, more vulnerable to deposit formation than those experienced in a petrol engine.\n\nStarCard streamlines business operations\n\nThe new Caltex StarCard is a power-packed fuel management card offering a convenient way to increase fleet management efficiency. It provides a wide range of adaptable features to manage fleet and personal expenses and is wholly suited to the ever-changing requirements of working in the construction industry. It has two main options, either ‘open’ or ‘close’ loop.\n\nOpen loop provides the ultimate coverage allowing access to all Caltex and Puma Energy service stations, and being welcome wherever WEX Motorpass cards are accepted.\n\nIn short, this means it can be used it at over 6,000 service stations and industry partners Australia-wide. Open Loop StarCards can also be used wherever Cabcharge is accepted and for services at Magic Hand Carwashes. A closed loop card means businesses can avoid paying transaction fees while enjoying access to the full range of Caltex with Techron fuels.\n\nBoth options can be set up for specific drivers and vehicles, with PIN protection available too. Additionally, StarCard provides a range of perks and discounts from leading tyre retailers, vehicle parts and accessory retailers, vehicle servicing providers and accommodation houses.\n\nStarCard is another solution offered by Caltex to keep businesses in control and allow operations to run smoothly.\n\nCaltex: your business partner to move forward\n\nCaltex is committed to the Australian market and making its products available to customers where and when they need them.\n\nWhether you’re running the family car, the construction site or the company fleet, Caltex is there to support you with expert advice and fuel equipment solutions, quality bulk fuel supply, premium engine oils and reliable lubricants."
