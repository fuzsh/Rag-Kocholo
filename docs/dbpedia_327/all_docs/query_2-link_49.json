        "text": "Techron is a proven (and harmless) product.\n\nDoes it do \"anything?\"\n\nIn theory, it contains chemicals (detergents/ cleaners) to reduce film build up in gas lines, injectors and carbon in combustion chambers.\n\nThere are many u-tube videos showing effects and comparisons to other products.\n\nYes, Chevron fuel contains this additive and some say it is good to switch top tier brands of fuel to rotate the fuel additives to maintain a system \"cleanliness\".\n\nFWIW.\n\nI use a strong dose of Techron additive before an oil change, running the tank with this additive to empty.\n\nThen do the oil change.\n\nIs it cost effective and a benefit?\n\nThat is a great debate.\n\nGood luck with your decision.\n\nI've used it in the past, but not with the last 4 vehicles I've owned.\n\n('06 with 200,000 miles**, 09 with 130,000 miles, 12 with 150,000 miles, and 2020 with 24,000 miles) - just to provide context.\n\nNone of these have ever had any fuel related problems, despite the fact that I usually use the cheapest fuel that's convenient in a relatively not grungy station.\n\n(**) The '06 (Envoy) developed a bit of an idling stumble at 120,000 miles that I corrected with a deep intake cleaning but I also replaced the coil packs after I got misfire code. It's the only thing in this car that would have necessitated a dealer visit for any of my cars for a non-DIY'er besides one fuel sending unit that I just didn't feel like changing myself.\n\nIt was about $300, and it's the only money that I can remember giving to a dealer for a repair in the last......(thinking)....25 years or so.\n\nSo....No\n\nI no longer use Techron, since I obviously don't need it.\n\nAll of the gas that I buy already has a pretty good cleaning agent...\n\nIn fact....up to 10 percent of the gas IS a pretty good cleaning agent.\n\nDoes it HURT?\n\nNope (IMHO)\n\nDoes it help?\n\n...your call.\n\nExcellent advice about using it just before an oil change.\n\nAs always.\n\nYOUR mileage may vary."
