        "text": "Caltex has a wide range of fuel, oil and lubricant options available Australia-wide\n\nThe short version of a long story is that Caltex is a global brand owned by Chevron – one of the world’s leading integrated energy companies with a 70-year history in Australia.\n\nThe Caltex brand was previously used by Ampol under an exclusive brand license, however that is now no longer exclusive and, from 2023, the Caltex brand will be solely used by Chevron.\n\nBack in 2020, Chevron also purchased the Puma Energy fuel business in Australia. That’s why you might have noticed established Caltex stations rebranding to Ampol, and selected Puma locations rebranding to new Caltex service stations.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIt matters because Caltex and Chevron plan to deliver high-quality products at fair prices through a wide-reaching distribution network.\n\nGuided by the vision to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance, it will offer quality fuels and industry-leading premium lubricants with great benefits.\n\nTechron, for example, is a specially formulated engine-cleaning additive that will be available across all fuel grades at the new Caltex service stations. It removes dirt and prevents deposits from forming, helping to improve performance and enhancing engine life.\n\nOn the lubrication side, Havoline (for petrol motors) and Delo (for diesels) continue to be available for every kind of industrial operation – from mining to agriculture, power generation to construction, trucking to global marine. And with a broad distribution network.\n\nCaltex is committed to the Australian market and making its products available to customers where and when they need them. Whether you’re running the family car, the farm or the company fleet, Caltex is there to support you with expert advice and fuel equipment solutions, quality bulk fuel supply, premium engine oils and reliable lubricants."
