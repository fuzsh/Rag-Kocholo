        "text": "725 posts ·\n\n#2 ·\n\nI can't speak about Techron, but the usual recommendation for Seafoam (another fuel additive) is to use the full bottle divided up over several full tanks. For example, if the bottle will treat 15 gallons and you add 5 gallons each time you fill up (I pulled those numbers out of thin air BTW, so don't take them as gospel), then you would use a third of the bottle for three consecutive tanks. I imagine any other additive would be the same.\n\n499 posts ·\n\n#3 ·\n\nI don't see any problem, nor have I had any, adding full more than the \"recommended\" amount of Techron or other cleaners.\n\nI have an beautiful 1980 Yamaha XS 1100 Special I bought in April, and have run many high concentrations of cleaner (seafoam, Chemtool, Lucas, you name it)through it so far. My thinking is because I don't ride it near as much as the Vee (800 miles since April vs. over 5,000 on the Strom) and usually for errands, etc, that the cleaner sits in there and can work better over time at cleaning/loosening anything up. The bike runs great, so I can't complain. My main concern is varnish in the carbs since that bike only has 13,900 original miles on it, and most of them came in the first 5 years of it's life.\n\nGo for it, it won't hurt anything.\n\n98 posts ·\n\n#4 ·\n\n1oz per gallon\n\n2568 posts ·\n\n#5 ·\n\nUnsure if there is any harm, however why not use it as directed?\n\nCheers\n\n1872 posts ·\n\n#6 ·\n\n+1, I divide my BG44K up as well. Get a ratio rite if ya don't already have one. Very handy for the shop.\n\n0 Reply\n\n13 posts ·\n\n#7 ·\n\nDon't use too much...\n\nUsing too much will leave heavy deposits on spark plug. I would use half a bottle (small size) in one full tank. Actually, it works best to run it through and shut it down (letting the stuff sit over night etc...) Great stuff though, used to use it on Fords to get past smog test... cleans behind the intake vales really good.\n\n9982 posts ·\n\n#8 ·\n\nProbably\n\nProbably won't hurt anything to over-use, but probably more beneficial to add proportionately, over several tankfuls of gas, rather than at higher concentration in one tank, especially if you think you have significant accumulations.\n\n20 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nWhat rgammie says makes sense about it leaving deposits on the spark plug.\n\nWhat most members seem to be saying is \"more is not necessarily better\" and you're probably wasting SeaFoam by using more than the recommended daily allowance.\n\nUse 5 ounces for 5 gallons and save some for your other motorized equipment.\n\n13140 posts ·\n\n#10 ·\n\nwhen I buy FI cleaner addative, I put about ¼ of the bottle in my bike then dump the rest in my cage"
