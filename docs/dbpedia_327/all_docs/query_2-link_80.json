I am not sure I believe him because he was out of there the next week.\n\nHowell in Corpus Christi, Texas\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE(Mr. Zorg @ Sep 7 2007, 01:11 PM) [snapback]508720[/snapback]</div> That's exactly what I was going to post. And I doubt the service manager was correct. When you put Techron in the tank, you're supposed to do it on a near-empty tank, but then fill it immediately, to both dilute the Techron and get it mixed well into the fuel. Undiluted Techron that was allowed to sit in the tank and then run through the fuel system at much higher than recommended concentrations might be harmful, but I really doubt there is any harm when used per the instructions.\n\nWell I see a few people had ideas about this. Thanks. But the answers were very unsure what the right answer was. Does anyone else have an opinion that is backed by some study on this subject or maybe even good or bad experiences with Techron and the oldest of the Prius cars?\n\nA prius engine will seldom if ever need a fuel injection cleaner. Any gas sold in the US has plenty of detergent already PLUS the fact that the prius engine does not idle that often. It is normally used at highways speeds which will burn off most deposits in the engine. Unless you do a TON of short trips and city driving then I would avoid using any such addatives."
