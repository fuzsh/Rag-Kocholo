Does he recall saying that it was necessary to have the legislation to close the loopholes by which these firms were evading the payment of stamp duties in the States? Has he now refused to vary the decision of the Commissioner of Taxation which denies exemption from payment of stamp duty on cheques to pre-school centre committees which work for the equipment and maintenance of Government controlled pre-school centres? Does this decision mean that pre-school centre committees, mothers’ clubs, school auxiliaries and parents and citizens associations must continue to pay stamp duty on cheques they draw in the Australian Capital Territory? Does the Minister know that under New South Wales legislation these bodies are entitled to exemption from stamp duty on cheques? Finally, I ask: How petty can the mightyCommonwealthbecome?\n\nMr MCMAHON:\n\nTreasurer · LOWE, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– I will have a look at the question. The honourable gentleman must realise that this question involves not only the interpretation of the law but also the powers and authorities of the Commissioner of Taxation.\n\npage 1944\n\nQUESTION\n\nINDUSTRIAL DISPUTE\n\nSir JOHN CRAMER:\n\nBENNELONG, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Labour and National Service. What action does the Government propose to take in connection with the Cockatoo Dock strike?\n\nMr MCMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– I have had a very good look at the problem that has been raised at the Cockatoo Dockyard, mainly because the claim there is based, in certain circumstances, on a similarity of working conditions at Garden Island. When the position is looked at it can be seen that the conditions of work and the payment scales at Garden Island are quite different from those at Cockatoo. In some cases the advantage lies with Cockatoo and in other cases it lies with Garden Island. But so far this is a dispute between the unions concerned and the management. Secondly, it has to be pointed out that as yet the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have not become involved in the dispute.\n\nI believe that the procedure that was announced in the metal trades case is a wise one. In other words, there should be a cooling off period to permit conciliation to take place. That conciliation was attempted by Mr Commissioner Winter, but his efforts failed. In my view, the wise course to follow here would be to handle this dispute with a great degree of care and to let the management itself take the responsibility, because this is a dispute in which the Commonwealth cannot interfere. The wise course would be for the management to play it with a great degree of calmness in the hope that wiser counsels will prevail. What I can assure the honourable gentleman is that I am in close contact with the Department of Labour and National Service. If there is anything further that I can say at a later stage on the advice that it tenders to me, I will attempt to give the information.\n\npage 1944\n\nQUESTION\n\nNORTHERN TERRITORY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Minister for the Interior: Has any member of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory resigned to contest the forthcoming elections for this House as such a member would have to do under the provisions of the Bill which this House passed 4 weeks ago? Can the Minister explain the slow progress of this Bill in another place where at least a dozen Bills introduced after it had been passed before it? If the Minister is having difficulty in securing the passage of this Bill concerning the Northern Territory, will he at least endeavour to secure before this House rises a vote on my Bill of 7 November last to give that Territory and his other ministerial responsibility, the Australian Capital Territory, the opportunity to vote for representation in the other place at next month’s elections?\n\nMr NIXON:\n\nMinister for the Interior · GIPPSLAND, VICTORIA · CP\n\n– I do not think I could guarantee the Leader of the Opposition that [ could arrange what he seeks in the last part of his question. I think that the stage which the business of this House has reached at this point in time is such that it would not be practicable for me even to suggest it to the Leader of the House. In relation to the first part of the question on the situation of the member of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, on Friday last I sent him a telegram telling him that the Senate, if I can call it that - I am not sure - had not had time to pass the legislation by the date that it needed to be gazetted. The legislation needed to be gazetted by Monday, 22nd September. That was the date on which any Legislative Councillor wishing to stand at the forthcoming elections had to resign his seat statutorily under the legislation.\n\nThe Senate did not pass the legislation last week. If the Bill were to be passed this week and the Legislative Councillor had not resigned voluntarily by the 22nd of this month, he would be prevented completely from being a candidate for the House of Representatives elections. As we do not wish to prevent the Legislative Councillor, if he so desires, being a candidate at all, I then suggested to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that the legislation should not be proceeded with in this week because this is the effect that it would have. This leaves the Legislative Councillor in exactly the same position in which he was in 1961 when he resigned voluntarily to meet this position after receiving legal advice.\n\npage 1945\n\nQUESTION\n\nAUSTRALIAN ECONOMY\n\nMr LEE:\n\nLALOR, VICTORIA\n\n– The Treasurer will know of my interest in the state of the economy. Will the right honourable gentleman advise the House and the nation of the overall economic position and the prospects for continuing economic progress?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– Like the honourable gentleman, I too am very interested in the state of the economy and its future prospects, but I can assure him that he has reasons for confidence and reasons for optimism in the same way as I have. I think that all the constituents of Bendigo equally have a good reason for confidence in the operations of this Government. Sir, as I see the position today and as I analyse the various signs that are coming forward, I believe that these do indicate in clear and unmistakable terms that the economy is moving forward in a progressive way.\n\nIn other words if we look at the employment figures we see that the number of registrants is continuing to fall. The number of job vacancies is continuing to rise. Housing commencements and building construction on a quarterly basis are continuing to rise and so too is the registration of motor vehicles. No matter where we happen to turn, including our trade figures, we will find that developments are proceeding in a way that was anticipated by the Government. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the prospects for the immediate future look equally good. In conclusion, I may say that I hope that this message will get home not only to the whole of the Australian community but also to the constituents of the honourable gentleman in Bendigo as well.\n\npage 1945\n\nQUESTION\n\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\nMELBOURNE, VICTORIA\n\n– Mr Speaker, I direct a question to you. If you manage to escape the wrath of the democrats of Phillip on 25th October and if the Gorton Government is equally fortunate, and if, as a result of these happenings, you are again elected\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, will you call an early meeting of the Standing Orders Committee of the 27th Parliament to consider amendments that will give the Speaker power to intervene at question time if he considers that a Minister is taking up too much time in his reply, or if a Minister reads a prepared reply to an obviously pre-arranged question, or if the Minister makes provocative and insulting remarks such as: ‘The honourable gentleman who asked this question merely displayed his complete ignorance of the subject’?\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The question is far too long.\n\nMr CALWELL:\n\n– I had to get my crack in against the Treasurer, Mr Speaker. Finally, will you, Mr Speaker, modernise the Standing Orders to bring them more into line with those of the British House of Commons?\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-I would say that the British House of Commons has of late adopted some of our procedures. The suggestions that the right honourable member has made will be considered. I want to remove any doubts that he may have about my tenure of the seat of Phillip. I will bc pleased to bring this matter to the notice of the Standing Orders Committee for its consideration.\n\npage 1945\n\nQUESTION\n\nWOOL\n\nMr HUNT:\n\nGWYDIR, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Can the Minister say how long it will be before he may expect a decision from the wool industry on the announced wool marketing proposals?\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nMinister for Primary Industry · RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES · CP\n\n– I announced last Sunday the Government’s offer to the wool industry. It was in reply to a recommendation from the wool industry for the upgrading of the Australian clip and for better presentation of it on world markets. It involved the relinquishment of control by the owners of 1-, 2-, and 3-bale lots. The members of the Australian Wool Industry Conference are now reporting back to their individual organisations. I presume that each of those organisations will look at the Government’s offer and decide whether it is acceptable or not. The Australian Wool\n\nBoard has been doing a cost benefit analysis of the proposal that was put to the Government. This was examined by the Government. Apart from our assessment of the cost benefit analysis we decided that there were also some features of the proposal that were not acceptable to the Government and we felt that certain improvements or refinements of the proposal would result in greater efficiency and effectiveness. In the light of the Government’s reviewed offer to the wool industry the Wool Board is now doing a new appraisal of the cost benefits. When this is done the Board will present it to the Australian Wool Industry Conference which in turn will distribute it to its constituted organisations. I should think that if everything went like clockwork, if there were no snags at all and everybody agreed - and I think that is asking a lot - the arrangement could come into operation at the beginning of next year. But T think a more realistic forecast would be that after full examination and discussion of the matter, and acceptance by the industry, it would be more likely to commence about the middle of next year.\n\npage 1946\n\nQUESTION\n\nDEFENCE\n\nMr BRYANT:\n\nWILLS, VICTORIA\n\n– I address my question to the Prime Minister. In view of the Russian naval presence in the Indian Ocean, does the right honourable gentleman still consider it to be sound strategy to station small Australian forces in Malaysia and Singapore, thousands of miles from Australian support? Has it not been one of the lessons of military history that isolated forces cannot be maintained without guaranteed lines of communication to their home bases? Or is he considering an agreement with the Russians to help keep our sea lanes open?\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nPrime Minister · HIGGINS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The answer to the second part of the honourable member’s question is no, as I am quite sure he realises and realised before he asked it. The answer to the first part of the question is yes, I believe that it is in Australia’s interest and in the interests of the region in which we live that there should be stationed in the area to our north in Singapore and the Peninsula of Malaya Australian forces - ground, air and naval - and that there should also be given to those countries assistance in the defence field to build up their own forces of the kind, for example, that this Government gave when it gave the Sabre aircraft to help build up the air force there. I think we need to demonstrate that we do have an interest in this region, that we do have an interest in seeing that it is not overrun by an external attack, and that being so we need to have our troops stationed in accordance with what we say and believe is in the interests of Australia’s defence.\n\npage 1946\n\nQUESTION\n\nTAXATION\n\nSIR WILLIAM HAWORTH:\n\nISAACS, VICTORIA\n\n– I desire to ask the Treasurer a question regarding taxation. Has he seen or heard of a questionnaire that has been sent by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Victoria to taxpayers who have engaged in trading transactions on the stock exchange, particularly in the shares of oil and mining companies? Does he realise that questions in this most comprehensive questionnaire call for a considerable amount of detail which the small investor just does not have available? Is the questionnaire drafted to discourage trading on the stock exchange in this type of mining exploration?\n\nMr McMAHON:\n\nLP\n\n– I have recently seen the questionnaire to which the honourable gentleman refers. It was sent by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Victoria to those taxpayers who had disclosed a profit or a return in excess of $500 for the year. The second point I wish to bring to the attention of the honourable member is that the intention of sections 77a, 77aa and 82 of the existing law is to give an incentive to investors in oil and mineral exploration companies. No action that the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioners take can be in contravention of the law. The third point I would like to make is that the Commissioner himself has instructed the Deputy Commissioners throughout the Commonwealth to cease the practice of making these inquiries. Until he has had a good look at the procedures and until he can get a uniform procedure throughout the Commonwealth, this practice will be discontinued.\n\npage 1946\n\nQUESTION\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE\n\nMr BARNARD:\n\nBASS, TASMANIA\n\n– I ask the Prime Minister a question about delays in dealing with salary claims by Commonwealth public servants in the Fourth Division. I remind the right honourable gentleman that when a claim was lodged on behalf of officers in this Division in 1963 increases were not made until 1967. Was an application lodged with the Arbitrator in early July? Have requests by the Federal Secretary of the Commonwealth Officers Association, Mr B. McMullen, for a conference been refused by the Public Service Board? As senior publice servants in the Second Division and Third Division have recently been granted pay increases, will similar consideration be extended to the 29,000 officers in the Fourth Division, which includes clerical assistants, typists, investigation officers, chainmen and machinists?\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nLP\n\n– I am not aware of the situation which has been reached regarding the claim before the Public Service Board or the request for arbitration to take place or what steps along that road have been made. This is a matter of normal Public Service Board procedure - at least the normal Public Service Board procedures are being used. I will seek to discover for the honourable member just when the claim was lodged and what position it has now reached.\n\npage 1947\n\nQUESTION\n\nRESEARCH\n\nMr BRIDGES-MAXWELL:\n\nROBERTSON, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Has the attention of the Minister for Education and Science been drawn to reports that Australian research has been closed down as a result of takeovers of Australian companies by overseas companies? Will he advise whether this is so and also the extent of the growth of support for non-governmental research in Australia?\n\nMr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– Governmental research has increased very greatly through the Government’s official organisations, such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Support for non-governmental research has also been greatly increased in recent times through the Australian Research Grants Committee and through funds made available under the control of the Minister for Trade and Industry. In a sense there have been disturbing statements in recent times by the Leader of the Opposition. There was a statement made first on 22nd February and published in the Press. That was repeated in the Press on 1 2th September and in Hansard on 16th September. These statements allege that in four instances there have been takeovers of one kind or another and as a result Australian research activities have been closed down. The suggestion is that overseas interests take advantage of the results of research in this country and then wilfully or irresponsibly close down Australian establishments.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– I rise to order. This is time for questions without notice. Obviously the Minister is giving an answer with notice. This is an abuse of question time.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! On many occasions I have informed the honourable member for Reid that the Chair has no jurisdiction in this matter. I think I even reminded him of this fact yesterday. If he continues to raise this point I may have to seek some way to deal with him.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– Mr Speaker-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-The honourable member will resume his seat.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– I object to the remarks you made. This is an abuse of question time-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– And I will continue in this way while question time is abused.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\nMr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– In every case there were aspects of the situation which were not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition and which would lead to a completely different interpretation if one were impartially examining the matter. 1 want to read to the House a letter dated 12th September which was sent to the ‘Australian’. I am told that a copy of it was sent to the Leader of the Opposition. This letter is almost identical with a letter sent to the ‘Australian’ on 25th February, but not published, a copy of which, I am advised, was also sent to the Leader of the Opposition. It reads:\n\nThe article, based on a speech by the Federal Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, listed a number of companies whose research departments have been closed down during the past 2 years. Although not specifically stated that the Varian Techtron’s research activities were curtailed, mentioning our name in the same context gave the impression that this was so. We believe that, after that piece of misleading information, your readers are entitled to know the truth about our research activities. At the time of our merger with Varian Associates 2 years ago our expenditure for research and development was 6% of total sales volume and since then it has increased to a current rate of 11% on an increased sales volume. This represents a 240% increase in actual research and development expenditure during this period. It should also be realised that all of this research and development is performed in Australia by Australians. The increased research and development growth will lead to both increased employment of Australians and increased export sales earnings. After only 2 years of association our export earnings have already doubled to $2m and our total employment has increased from 160 to 250.\n\nThis was the second time that a copy of the letter was sent to the Leader of the Opposition as a result of repeating these incorrect allegations. As a result of the repetition by the Leader of the Opposition the company wrote to me, and sent me a copy of these letters from the managing director.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– I move an extension of time for the Minister.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! It is not necessary. The Minister has the right to continue.\n\nMr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I want to repeat two reasonably brief paragraphs of the letter written to me by the company. The letter states:\n\nAs both articles contain false implications against our company we have written to the Editor of the ‘Australian’ on both occasions with a copy to Mr Whitlam. Copies are now enclosed for your information. Our first letter was delayed and the Editor did not use it But we understand the second letter will be used on September 15th. It is rather annoying that although Mr Whitlam had the true facts about our company after receiving a copy of our first letter the only use he apparently made of it in his second speech was to use the correct name of TECHTRON.\n\n” /I\n\npage 1948\n\nQUESTION\n\nROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\nCORIO, VICTORIA\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister for the Army. I ask: Is it a fact that cadets who are broken down during the early part of their training by the bastardisation process at Duntroon are required to pay several hundred dollars in order to obtain discharge? If this is a fact and if as has been reported he will make a statement that this process will be ended will he give consideration to refunding to parents who have had to pay for the discharge of former cadets the moneys which they have been forced to pay because of a process which quite obviously lent nothing to their training?\n\nMr LYNCH:\n\nMinister for the Army · FLINDERS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– The question to which the honourable gentleman refers in the first instance - that is to say the allegations relating to certain incidents which are alleged to have taken place at the Royal Military College, Duntroon - will in fact be subject to quite a detailed, frank and forthright statement by myself immediately after question time in this House. Therefore, I make no comment on that aspect of the question.\n\nHowever in regard to the other question that the honourable member posed, it is true that in certain cases students who resign from the Royal Military College may be required to refund moneys to the College as a consequence of the amount of money which the Australian Army has expended in their education. These details, of course, are variable according to the circumstances and according to the period in which the students had been at the college. I will certainly make inquiries along the lines suggested. I will check the facts and I will let the honourable member know.\n\npage 1948\n\nQUESTION\n\nSOCIAL SERVICES\n\nMiss BROWNBILL:\n\nKINGSTON, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister for Social Services. By how much have age, invalid and widows pensions and unemployment benefits been increased since the last time the Labor Party was in office? Making allowance for price changes, what has been the real increase in the real values? I might point out to honourable members that this question is al) my own work.\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\nMinister for Social Services · MACKELLAR, NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– The question that the honourable member raises is one of great interest. I was expecting that one of the members on the opposite side might have put it to me. I have made, however, -\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– I will move that the reply be incorporated in Hansard.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The Chair will not accept the motion.\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\n– Once again the Opposition has anticipated me. I have a reply here. In view of your desire that replies be kept short and as these documents are completely factual I ask that they be incorporated in Hansard.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I thank the Minister. Is leave granted?\n\nMr Daly:\n\n– Yes.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Leave is granted.\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\n– The first document deals with the assessment of pensions between 1949 and 1969. The second deals with the effect of the means test between those years.\n\npage 1949\n\nMEANS TEST LABOR 1949\n\nPension was reduced by full amount of earnings or income (including income from property) above $3 per week. In addition pension was reduced by $2 per year for every $20 of property above $200 up to $900, and by $4 per year for every $20 of property above $900. No pension payable if property exceeded $1,500. {: .page-start } page 1949 {:#debate-14} ### LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY 1969 Actual income from property is excluded, but 1/520 of property above $400 counts as weekly income. No pension payable if property exceeds $21,200 ($37,200 married couple). Aged Persons Homes Scheme introduced 1954. Since then 33,000 beds provided. Sheltered Workshops Scheme introduced 1967. Employees now number 3,350. {: .page-start } page 1950 {:#debate-15} ### QUESTION {:#subdebate-15-0} #### WOOL VILLAGE {: #subdebate-15-0-s0 .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. By way of preface 1 refer the Minister to the fact that on Tuesday of this week I asked him a question about the wool village at Yennora in Sydney and whether the Commonwealth Government had agreed to make some $12m available for the construction of that village. In his reply the Minister said: >There has been no consultation with or recommendation to the Commonwealth. 1 would assume that when these discussions have concluded and some recommendations are made we will hear about the proposal, if it involves the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister: Has he seen or heard of the editorial in today's 'Australian Financial Review' which claims that **Sir William** Gunn, together with Board members **Mr D.** Campbell and **Mr C.** Renshaw and the Board's manager of wool handling, **Mr G.** Pemberton, on 9th September in Sydney, at a meeting of wool interests, said that the Australian Wool Board had discussed with **Mr Anthony** a proposal that the Wool Board borrow funds to build the wool selling complex in Sydney and lease the facilities back to wool selling brokers; that the Minister, like the Graziers Association of New South Wales, wants a statement of costs and benefits before he makes a statement to the Cabinet; and that if the statement of costs and benefits shows clear financial advantages to wool growers, brokers and wool buyers the Minister anticipates he will have no difficulty in obtaining Cabinet approval to guarantee a loan to the Australian Wool Board? **Mr Speaker,** I vouch for the authenticity of this report and I will, if necessary, produce a copy of the minutes of this meeting. I ask: Why did the Minister lie to me and the Parliament- {: #subdebate-15-0-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark. {: .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- I withdraw the word 'lie'. I ask: Why did the Minister mislead me and the Parliament in his reply on Tuesday? If he did not mislead me and the Parliament why did **Sir William** Gunn lie to the meeting of wool interests in Sydney? {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: {: .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- AH right, I will withdraw the word 'lie' as far as **Sir William** Gunn is concerned. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Order! I think the Chair has been fairly lenient to the honourable member because his question is one of importance and involves a matter of public interest. However, the question is far too long. I remind the honourable member that any question which contains the names of persons outside the Parliament and which by implication is derogatory of them should be placed on the notice paper. {: .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- I shall complete' my question. Why did the Minister for Primary Industry mislead me and the Parliament in his reply on Tuesday? If he did not mislead me and the Parliament on Tuesday why did **Sir William** Gunn mislead the meeting of wool interests in Sydney on 9th September by saying that the Board had conferred with the Minister for Primary Industry about finance for the wool village at Yennora? {: #subdebate-15-0-s2 .speaker-BU4} ##### Mr ANTHONY:\n\nCP -- I can give the honourable member my assurance that 1 have not misled him or this Parliament. This morning I read the leader in the 'Australian Financial Review*. From my reading of it the authors are trying to get themselves off the hook for a statement they made earlier in the week to the effect that the Government had offered $10m or $12m, whatever it might be, for the establishment of a wool selling complex at Yennora. Let us look at the facts. Apparently, to justify their case, they have got hold of some minutes of a confidential meeting held between the Australian Wool Board and certain interests in Sydney and they are basing their editorial on those minutes. Whether these minutes are right or wrong, I will not enter into that dispute. The facts of the matter are that no recommendation has been made to the Commonwealth. Government and there has been no consultation between the Australian Wool Board and the Commonwealth Government. Let me make that a little clearer. {: .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- Did **Sir William** mislead them in that case? {: .speaker-BU4} ##### Mr ANTHONY: -- About 1 month ago - if this is what **Sir William** was referring to - I was passing through Brisbane on my way home to my electorate and I spent 1 hour having a meal with him during which we talked about all manner of interests ranging from Tipperary through to wool. It was a completely informal meeting and naturally I asked him how the wool village was proceeding and he said that they were having consultations. That is as far as that discussion went. But last week, or a fortnight ago, after making inquiries from my Department **Sir William** Gunn came to Canberra to see me. He could not see me because I was attending Cabinet meetings. He saw officers of my Department and told them that he had been up interviewing the Commonwealth Superannuation Board to see whether it would be interested in making money available to the Australian Wool Board for the establishment of a wool selling village at Yennora. In his discussions with officers of my Department he asked what my reaction would be to this. A few days later, when I got around to seeing the file on this matter that the officers referred to me, I said: 'Look, if they can do a cost benefit analysis to show that it will be a going concern then I will be quite happy to put it up to the Government.' If it were simply a case of being able to borrow money for a sound proposition then I thought there would be a likelihood of the Government accepting it. {: .page-start } page 1951 {:#debate-16} ### QUESTION {:#subdebate-16-0} #### DROUGHT RELIEF {: #subdebate-16-0-s0 .speaker-KGA} ##### Mr HALLETT:\n\nCANNING, WESTERN AUSTRALIA -- Has the Prime Minister received requests from the Western Australian Government for financial assistance to Western Australia to relieve the effects of drought conditions? If he has not yet received an application, would the Government be prepared to give such application full consideration? {: #subdebate-16-0-s1 .speaker-KH5} ##### Mr GORTON:\n\nLP -- I could not quite hear the last part of the question but the first part, as I understood it, was whether I had received a request from the Government of Western Australia for assistance for drought relief in that State. No such request has come to me or come to my notice as yet. {: .page-start } page 1951 {:#debate-17} ### QUESTION {:#subdebate-17-0} #### POVERTY: CIVILIAN WIDOWS {: #subdebate-17-0-s0 .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM: -- I ask a question of the Minister for Social Services. During the debate on the Social Services Bill the honourable gentleman spoke of the poverty line, which had been devised by Professor Henderson and his colleagues at the University of Melbourne, as $33 per week in 1966 and he purported to give the datum as at present. This was on 9th September. I ask him whether he had, when he spoke, discussed the poverty line as at today with the professor or his colleagues since he last met them, I believe, at the Australian Institute of Political Science summer school last January. In particular, has his attention been drawn to an article by one of them which appeared on 1st September in the 'Legacy Weekly Bulletin' stating that at present the comparable poverty line is $40. In particular, did he observe that the author said that the only persons who are above the poverty line today amongst civilian widows are those who have a child under 6 years of age, and that all others are still below the poverty line? {: #subdebate-17-0-s1 .speaker-DB6} ##### Mr WENTWORTH:\n\nLP -- I have not had an opportunity recently of conferring with the gentleman that the Leader of the Opposition named but I am familiar with what the authors themselves have stated. 1 was at pains in the speech that I made - as he will see if he does me the honour of reading what I said - to point out that it was not legitimate to change the poverty line in this way. What was said was that at a certain date - I think from memory that it was in June 1966 - an arbitrary poverty line could be established by taking the then basic wage, adding to it family endowment and also an arbitrary loading of 60c or 80c. I forget the exact figure, but it was an arbitrary loading of that order. That poverty line can be changed by adjusting it to the price level. To change it in any other way would incorporate something which the Leader of the Opposition perhaps would not like to have incorporated, that is, that during that time average wages have risen faster than prices. That is to say, people outside the pensioner range have been doing much better under this Government. As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition contends that wage earners have not been doing so well under this Government. To confute him on his own figures, I point out that what is said is that the position of the average wage earner in the last 2 or 3 years has improved. If we look at the position of the pensioner we find that, in terms of purchasing power, it also has improved. If the houourable gentleman will do me the honour of again looking at the paper I incorporated in Hansard a few moments ago he will see how much the real value of the pensions available to widows have been improved since Labor was last in office. In point of fact, the real value of the pension for a widow with children is now nearly three times, in terms of purchasing power, what it was when Labor was last in office. The Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of asking such a question. {: .page-start } page 1952 {:#debate-18} ### PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS {: #debate-18-s0 .speaker-KEC} ##### Mr KENNEDY:\n\nBENDIGO, VICTORIA · ALP -- I wish to make a personal explanation. {: #debate-18-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? {: .speaker-KEC} ##### Mr KENNEDY:\n\nBENDIGO, VICTORIA · ALP -- I claim to have been misrepresented.

The only thing he may do is explain to the House how he has been misrepresented. {: .speaker-KEC} ##### Mr KENNEDY:\n\nBENDIGO, VICTORIA · ALP -- The Treasurer referred to the people of Bendigo as being the constituents of the honourable member for Lalor. I am the honourable member for Bendigo. The honourable member for Lalor represents a far distant electorate, and I believe that he lives some 50 or 60 miles from the nerve centre of my electorate. {: #debate-18-s2 .speaker-KVG} ##### Mr STOKES:\n\nMaribyrnong -- I claim to have been misrepresented. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Does the honourable member wish to make a personal explanation? {: .speaker-KVG} ##### Mr STOKES: -- Yes. The misrepresentation occurs in an article issued by the Australian Labor Party and published in the Melbourne 'Sun' of yesterday's date under the heading '24-Hour Jets'. The paragraphs which I claim to be a misrepresentation read: The reason given for a 24-hour operation at Tullamarine is that it is more economical for the airlines if they are permitted to operate around the clock. This statement, reported to have been made by **Mr Stokes,** the Liberal Member for Maribyrnong, indicates quite clearly that the Liberal Government is more interested in profits than people. Now, the statement referred to as coming from me arises from an article in the Melbourne 'Herald' of more than a week ago in which I gave an affirmative answer to a question as to whether Tullamarine as a round-the-clock airport would tend to become busier than Mascot if operations into Sydney were still restricted. Of course it is more economical for airlines to have their aircraft fully employed. But at no time have I ever subscribed to the sacrifice of the rights of the people in the interests of the economical operation of any airline. On the contrary, as a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, I can assure the House that my colleagues and I are directing our efforts towards the introduction of noise abatement procedures to protect the people from undue exposure to unwarranted noise levels. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Order!

I would have preferred to make this speech on a statement which I expected would be made by the Minister for Trade and Industry **(Mr McEwen).** The Opposition had been asked to give the Minister leave to make a statement upon the presentation of the report under the Industrial Research and Development Act. However, I cannot speak on that, nor, of course, can the Minister for Education and Science **(Mr Malcolm Fraser),** because he never will speak in a debate. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Order! The Leader of the Opposition sought leave to make a personal explanation. {: .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM: -- I am therefore limited to speaking- {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- The honourable gentleman could ask leave to make a statement. {: .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM: -- Thank you, **Mr Speaker.** I ask for leave to make a statement. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Is leave granted? **Mr McEwen** - No. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- Leave is not granted. {: .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM: -- Then I must limit myself to the matter upon which I was misrepresented. During question time, apparently with warning, the Minister for Education and Science read out a letter which he said I had received. Members of my staff assure me that they cannot find such a letter. I may add that following a report of the same speech another company did write to me. If there was an opportunity for a debate I would read that company's letter into the record. It confirms my assertion that the Australian research activities of this company had been discontinued. But I must limit myself to the particular matter upon which I was misrepresented. Therefore I will read what I said. I do not know how it was reported in all the newspapers and I have not the letter from the company, but what I said when opening the symposium of the New South Wales division of the Australia and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, on 11th September was this: >Varian Associates, an American electronics enterprise, took over in 1967 Techtron Pty Ltd, the Melbourne firm which pioneered commercial development of atomic absorption spectrophotometry techniques developed in die laboratories of the CSIRO and by 1966 had annual earnings of some S2m of which half was drawn from export markets. . . . > >Australian scientists are rightly concerned at the ease with which small Australian companies profiting from the results of indigenous research are allowed to fall a prey to foreign takeovers, . . . {: #debate-20-s2 .speaker-QS4} ##### Mr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP -- **Mr Speaker,** I wish to make a personal explanation. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented? {: .speaker-QS4} ##### Mr Malcolm Fraser:\n\nWANNON, VICTORIA · LP -- Yes, I do. The information I read to the House was contained in two letters that were sent to the Australian'. It appeared from the letter I read out from Techtron Pty Ltd that at the same time these letters had also been sent to the Leader of the Opposition **(Mr Whitlam).** The honourable gentleman has read out in relation to this matter a part of some of the remarks that he made. I would like to read out those remarks in full. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- Order!

I ask for the leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with this report. {: #subdebate-21-0-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- There being no objection, leave is granted. {: .speaker-KVR} ##### Mr SWARTZ: -- Honourable members will recall that, on 18th March of this year, I provided some information to this House as to the progress of the investigation of this accident. I said that, when this investigation was completed and the accident report was prepared, 1 would table the document and this I have just done. I realise that this report is being tabled in the last days of the current Parliament but, as I recently indicated in answer to a question by the honourable member for East Sydney **(Mr Devine),** a very essential part of this investigation has been fatigue testing which was carried out in the United Kingdom and the report on this work has only recently been received. I said at that time that I expected to be able to submit the accident report about the end of September and officers of the Air Safety Investigation Branch have worked very strenuously to avoid delays beyond that time in the preparation of the report which came to me from the printer, only yesterday. In fact, it was late yesterday afternoon. The results of the fatigue tests carried out. at our request by the British Aircraft Corporation have now been considered in conjunction with the considerable evidence gathered by the investigation team as well as the very valuable work done by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories and the Defence Standards Laboratories which are under the control of my colleague, the Minister for Supply **(Senator Anderson).** The tabled report sets out the reasons why it is now abundantly clear that this flared bush substantially reduced the fatigue endurance of the main spar lower boom in the starboard wing and the best estimate of the amount of this reduction is that it was of the order of 50% . Whilst these tests were in progress approximately twenty other spar booms, which had been retired from service since the accident, were inspected by the British Aircraft Corporation and a number of small fatigue cracks was found in them. None of these cracks was in itself dangerous to the aircraft from which the boom was removed but it is apparent that there would have been significant reductions in the strength of these booms if they had been allowed to complete the whole of the life previously specified for them. It is also apparent that the presence of any defect similar to the flared bush which was found in VH-RMO could have induced a premature failure, as it did in the Australian aircraft. Prior to this accident, the fact that over 440 Viscount aircraft had been built and operated for some 16 years without there being any accident resulting from a fatigue failure or any signs of fatigue cracking found in booms inspected after retirement supported the view that the Air Registration Board, which is the primary certificating authority for this aircraft type, had set the retirement life at an appropriately conservative figure. The experience of this accident, however, and the knowledge gained from the post-accident inspection of other booms indicates that the degree of conservatism believed to apply in the prescription of 11,400 flights, as the retirement life, did not exist. Tt should be appreciated, however, that the prescribed retirement life is not intended to accommodate the effects of a gross defect such as a flared bush. In the appendices to this report honourable members may see for themselves the evidence of fatigue cracking which occurred in the boom as well as graphical presentations of the effect of flared bushes on its fatigue endurance. I commend this report for all honourable members to read since it unfolds, step by step, the factors which led to this tragic accident. At each point the evidence has been clearly corroborated and documented and the argument proceeds in logical steps to the cause conclusion. This states that the cause of this accident was that the fatigue endurance of the starboard inner main spar lower boom was substantially reduced by the insertion of a flared bush at station 143 when the margin of safety associated with the retirement life specified for such booms did not ensure that this boom would achieve its retirement life in the presence of such a defect. Prior to this accident my Department, of course, had no greater knowledge than any of the other certificating authorities around the world as to the existence of fatigue cracking in Viscount aircraft. There was no reason to believe that the retirement life prescribed by the primary certificating authority, the Air Registration Board, was any less conservative than was claimed. As soon as it became known, however, that this accident was the result of a fatigue failure in the spar boom, the Director-General immediately decided that all 700 series Viscounts should be withdrawn from service. He later allowed Viscount 756 aircraft to return to service when it became apparent that this type of failure was not likely to occur in either the 756 or 810 series aircraft. The reasons for this are set out in a little more detail on page 30 of the Civil Aviation report 1968-1969 which I presented to Parliament only last week, and honourable members may be assured that no fatigue failure is likely to occur in the booms of these aircraft even in the very unlikely event that one of them also contains a gross defect of the type disclosed by this investigation. The present situation is that the earlier 700 series Viscount aircraft are still not permitted to fly in this country and it is of interest that Australia was the only country to take this action. The general action taken overseas was to reduce the retirement life of these booms to 7,000 flights as was recommended by the Air Registration Board. Although sufficient information is now available to make, with some confidence, an assessment of the causes of the accident to VH-RMQ, the Director-General is still of the view that more factual data would have to become available to resolve all doubts as to the position of these aircraft before their return to service could be considered. The two airline companies involved hold similar views and these aircraft will not fly in Australia again. Finally, **Mr Speaker,** I would like to remind the House that, as early as March in this year, I stated that the investigations had revealed a great deal of evidence as to the underlying causes of this accident; so much so thatI was able to decide at that time that our knowledge of this accident would not be assisted in any significant degree by the appointment of a board of inquiry. The legislation provides that the appointment of a board of accident inquiry is at the discretion of the Minister and, such boards have, in fact, been appointed on three occasions in recent years. The Chairman of these Boards, and the various expert assessors, have carried out their tasks with great care and diligence and, in each instance, there was complete consistency between the findings of the Chairman and the conclusions as reached in the investigation conducted by the Air Safety Investigation Branch of my Department. I make this comment only for the purpose of illustrating the confidence which can be attached to the investigations carried out by the Air Safety Investigation Branch and to demonstrate why, in this instance, having regard to the very early and precise pinpointing of the causal area, I did not feel that appointment of a board of accident inquiry was warranted. I stress that, in other circumstances, I would have had no hesitation in appointing a board of accident inquiry. **Mr Speaker,** I am in agreement with the conclusions set out in this report and I am confident that the immediate and continuing action taken by the Department, as a result of this accident will prevent the recurrence of such a tragic event arising from similar causes. Motion (by **Mr Erwin)** proposed: That the House take note of the paper. {: .speaker-KDV} ##### Mr Charles Jones:\n\nNEWCASTLE, VICTORIA · ALP -- Have I an assurance from the Leader of the House that the debate will be resumed this day? {: .speaker-KDO} ##### Mr Erwin: -- The debate will be resumed either this day or tomorrow.

These allegations have been fully probed by a board of inquiry whose report and findings were submitted to me yesterday. I am taking this first opportunity to provide the House with a summary of the conclusions reached by the Board of Inquiry and an outline of the action which I propose should now be taken. Let me at the outset traverse the history of this matter. On 25th August last **Mr Gerald** Walsh, a lecturer in history at the College, addressed a letter to the Commandant drawing attention to what he considered to be ill-treatment of members of the fourth class by the senior cadets. Following discussion between the Commandant, **Mr Walsh** and the Dean, **Sir Leslie** Martin, it was decided that the first available date on which action in relation to the letter could be taken was Friday, 5th September. Concurrently, I received from private sources information that incidents amounting to bullying might be occurring at Duntroon. I immediately directed that inquiries be made. On Friday 5th September the Commandant met his senior academic military staff to consider the allegations. Consequential upon this meeting and my own direction, a Board of Inquiry was immediately convened. The terms of reference were agreed on Saturday 6th September and the Board held its first meeting on Monday 8th September. The Board consisted of three - Lieutenant-Colonel Hosking, LieutenantColonel in Charge of Administration at Duntroon; **Major Wells, Deputy** Assistant Quartermaster-General; and **Mr Hill,** Senior Lecturer in History. I should point out that Lieutenant-Colonel Hosking and **Major Wells** were selected because, although on the staff at Duntroon, their duties were purely administrative and they had no direct relationship with the Corps of Staff Cadets, which is a self-contained group within the College. The terms of reference and the policy directive referred to therein are by now well known. However, for completeness I will, with the concurrence of the House, have their terms incorporated in Hansard. They are as follows: {: .page-start } page 1957 {:#debate-23} ### TERMS OF REFERENCE RMC Board of Inquiry The Terms of Reference of the Board of Inquiry, which were drawn up after discussions between the Commandant and the Members of the Academic Staff are - These are considered wide and general terms which will enable this matter to be thoroughly probed. {: .page-start } page 1957 {:#debate-24} ### CSC POLICY DIRECTIVE The Assimilation and Regimental Training of the Fourth Class 14 February 1969 Reference: CSC Standing Orders 239 and 240 {:#subdebate-24-0} #### Conclusion {: type=\"1\" start=\"8\"} 0. The training of the Fourth Class is designed to assist the development of the personal characteristics of each cadet within the framework of the demands of military service, to produce a military leader of a calibre comparable to his contemporaries outside the service. 1. In this early stage of his development, nothing is to be done which will adversely effect a cadet's right to adequate rest, nourishment, recreation, and study. At this point I wish to divert from Duntroon for a moment and inform the House that consequent upon these allegations of illtreatment I instituted inquiries in respect of other Army training establishments. I have now received from the AdjutantGeneral reports covering the Officer Cadet School at Portsea, the Officer Training Unit at Scheyville, the Apprentices' School at Balcombe and the Recruit Training Battalions at Puckapunyal, Kapooka and Singleton. I have been assured that the General Officers Commanding Southern and Eastern Commands, in which these training establishments are located, have carried out thorough investigations into the practices currently extant. Honourable members will no doubt be aware that within the last week or so there have been allegations in the Press that ill-treatment, similar to that which has been the subject of investigation at Duntroon, had occurred or was still occurring at Scheyville and the Apprentices' School, Balcombe. Dealing with Scheyville, I am advised that bullying of the type alleged in the Press does not occur at the establishment there. However, when a large group of young men live together it is almost inevitable that there will be isolated instances of ragging of juniors as they join the group. {: #subdebate-24-0-s0 .speaker-KIM} ##### Mr LYNCH:\n\nLP -- The honourable gentleman will listen to the statement. There have been and no doubt will be occasional departures from permissible practices, but a very thorough inquiry has confirmed that such departures are rare and random in nature. Illegal punishments and bullying of any description are expressly prohibited by Standing Orders at Scheyville and the Commandant and staff are alert to the need for continuous vigilance to ensure that they do not occur. With regard to the allegations of standing naked, screaming obscenities and other forms of humiliation, I have been assured by the AdjutantGeneral that no evidence of these practices has been found. It will be appreciated that the allegations appearing in the Press were general in nature and not specific as to time, names or the source of the information. However, if the ex-national service officer who made the allegations is prepared to give names and dates his allegations will be further investigated and any necessary action will most certainly be taken. With regard to the Apprentices' School, honourable members may have noted that the allegations quoted by the Melbourne Truth' were stated to have been made by an ex-apprentice who, on his own statement, left the School in 1967. Honourable members may also recall that in 1966 a court of inquiry was convened to examine certain allegations covering the behaviour of apprentices. The findings of that inquiry indicated that insufficient staff had been available for proper supervision of apprentices. As a result the staff was increased to the extent that one Regular NonCommissioned Officer is now in charge of each platoon of 36 apprentices, company duty officers sleep in the company lines and one is always present throughout 24 hours per day. Further, the junior class is segregated into a company of its own and is not in close contact with the intermediate and senior classes. In addition to the Regular Non-Commissioned Officer, a senior apprentice Non-Commissioned Officer is placed in charge of each building containing 12 apprentices. There have been isolated instances of bullying since 1967 which have resulted in the reduction in rank of one apprentice and the discharge of four apprentices who were found guilty. I have also been assured that no evidence can be found of ill-treatment presently arising at the Officer Cadet School or at the Recruit Training Battalions at Puckapunyal, Kapooka or Singleton. That there have been or will be isolated cases where instructions are violated could not be denied, but honourable members can be satisfied that whenever such instances are detected appropriate action is taken and I instance the one of RMC Duntroon which I will deal with in a moment. I turn therefore to the proceedings of the Board of Inquiry at Duntroon. Members of the military and academic staff were invited to give evidence before the Board, and statements were taken from all fourth class cadets. It will be noted that the terms of reference specified fourth class 1969. However, after the Board had commenced sitting, specific allegations were made that some, at least, of those 1968 fourth class cadets who had left the College during that year had done so because of the ill-treatment they had suffered. In these circumstances, the President of the Board decided to interview these cadets if they were prepared to give evidence. The five ex-fourth class cadets of 1969 and the twelve of the 1968 year were invited to appear before the Board. Of these, 4 of 1969 and 8 of 1968 accepted and duly appeared before the Board. To ensure that all available facts were brought before the Board, members of the public who felt they could give information were invited to submit statements on any matter relevant to the investigation, but no such statements have been received by the Board. Between 8th September and 22nd September, the Board took evidence from 143 witnesses comprising 11 members of the academic staff, 14 of the military staff, 101 current fourth class cadets, 5 cadets of the senior class and 12 ex-cadets. The report of the Board, based on the very comprehensive evidence which it had obtained, was submitted to the Commandant on 23rd September 1969. The Board, after consideration of the evidence taken has reported its findings in relation to the contravention or otherwise of the Directive on fourth class training and I will now summarise these findings. Honourable members may be assured the summary I am about to give does not omit any significant aspect. I informed the House last week that nothing relevant to this matter would in fact be swept under the carpet and I trust the House will appreciate that it is my intention to provide a complete and frank statement. The Board found that there was evidence to show that the Directive had been contravened particularly in regard to paragraphs 6 and 9. Amongst other things, paragraph 6 provides that no cadet is to be bullied in any way; or threatened or coerced in any manner or subjected to personal indignities, humiliation or ridicule. The Board made it clear that it viewed the term 'bullying' in its widest context and not merely as implying physical threat or violence. The Board reports that evidence existed that the instruction contained in paragraph 6 had been contravened in instances of the following type: Two senior cadets simultaneously giving conflicting orders to a junior, sometimes standing on either side of him; junior class cadets being required to stand at attention for excessive periods whilst being questioned by seniors. One cadet reported two cases of a light being directed into a cadet's eyes whilst being questioned; awarding of unauthorised punishments such as 'press ups', amounting in extreme cases to 200 in one day and impositions for failure to answer questions when it was unreasonable to expect the cadet to be able to do so. One cadet fell and hit his head as a result of excessive 'press ups'; placing a junior class cadet in such a position that some free periods were taken up in obtaining information for seniors, lest failure to do so led to additional imposts; junior cadets had been required to take additional cold showers, to shower in parts of their equipment and occasionally to do 'press ups' in the bath; cadets, in some cases, have been refused a place at several tables in the mess or been abused in front of others or required to stand on a table and sing. In two extreme cases cadets were required to kneel before a senior cadet; isolated cases of cadets being required to eat sitting on the floor; although not a common practice, cadets had been required to consume a concoction of various condiments; cadets taking breakfast to cadets of the two senior classes. I make it clear to the House that I would regard these instances in varying degrees as humiliating, stupid or simply a waste of time. Only one case of physical violence was included in the evidence before the Board. A member of the junior class stated that he had been physically forced into a bathroom by an unnamed senior classman and had six buckets of cold water thrown over him. Although one cadet expressed his resentment at some comments made about his religion by a senior cadet, the Board found no evidence of any improper reference, either stated or implied, to a cadet's background, family, religious beliefs or personal life. The Board also found that assimilation training did not cease at the end of first term as intended by the Directive. In addition, although the instruction that training should cease on week nights at 7 p.m. had generally been observed, some cadets had found it necessary to complete, during study periods, impositions which had been set by senior cadets. With regard to para graph 9 of the Directive, whilst no evidence was available that any junior cadet's rest, nourishment or recreation had been adversely affected, there was considerable evidence that no allowance was made by senior cadets for the time involved in completing impositions set by them. The Board states that, as a result, many junior cadets used private study periods and class time to the detriment of their work. Most junior class cadets found that training left them tense and flustered especially after the evening meal and, as a result, it took some time to settle down to study. What I have said covers in detail the essential areas of the Board's report. I turn now to two specific cases to which reference has been made in the Parliament and the Press. It is a fact that early in 1968 a fourth class cadet collapsed and was admitted to hospital where he remained for some 25 days before discharge from the Army. It is also a fact that, prior to admission to hospital he had been subjected to a period of some 3 hours 'hazing' by a senior NCO cadet. The 'hazing* consisted primarily of a heavy pressure of questioning and tidying his room. The senior cadet's behaviour was in every way reprehensible and he was at the time punished by reduction in rank. The ex-cadet concerned gave evidence before the Board last week. The other matter relates to the alleged attempted suicide at the RMC on 1st September. The facts are that a junior cadet was discovered in his room at the RMC on the evening of 1st September with cuts on his left wrist. He was admitted to the RMC hospital. The investigating officer, the medical officer on duty, and the consulting psychiatrist who was called in, confirmed that what bad happened was in the nature of a gesture to draw attention to his personal problems rather than an attempt to commit suicide. I am informed that the cadet himself attributed his action to his unhappiness with his academic progress and, when questioned, specifically denied that it had anything to do with ill-treatment of the junior class. Nothing has arisen as a result of the Board of Inquiry's investigations which would vary this conclusion. It *is cleat* from the Board's report that there have been breaches of the Policy Directive governing the permissible scope and limits of fourth class training, that these breaches should have occurred is clearly indicative of unsatisfactory administration both within the Corps of Staff Cadets and amongst those who are directly responsible for its day-to-day functioning, that these breaches cannot be condoned, and that disciplinary action against those responsible for these departures is called for as well as remedial action for the future. I can assure the House that these matters have been given the most careful consideration by the Chief of the General Staff in the light of the Board's report and the Commandant's views thereon. The Chief of the General Staff has informed me that the following action will be taken: The Commandant will prefer charges against one and possibly a second Regular Army officer; Two and possibly more officers who are considered by the Command on the evidence before him to be unfitted for their present appointments are to be reposted from RMC; One officer will be transferred to other duties within RMC; Charges will be preferred against some senior cadets. I further emphasise that positive steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of these unfortunate breaches and to ensure that the forms of training which have given rise to, or have been exposed by, the Inquiry must cease. In saying this I make two points. In the first place, it is clear from the Board's very thorough and detailed report that, no matter what mistakes have been made in the application and interpretation of the directive regarding fourth class training, members of the senior classes with the one exception I have mentioned have adhered strictly to the rule forbidding any physical contact between junior and senior cadets. I am aware that the term 'bullying' embraces more than physical means, but I think in view of the Press publicity in this matter the House should know that there is ample evidence for the Board to conclude that physical contact is one form of bullying rejected by the senior classes. In the second place, one question which must receive further consideration is whether or not the type of training which is specified in the RMC directive for fourth class train ing has a necessary part in achieving the purposes of the College and should, therefore, be continued. Whilst outwardly it would appear easy and attractive to reject outright the whole concept and issue instructions prohibiting any training of this kind, this is a complex question and there are many factors which need to be taken into consideration. With the affiliation of RMC with the University of New South Wales and with changes in both the methodology of and approach to education in civil as well as military establishments, it seems necessary and desirable that the need for this type of training and the aims it seeks to achieve should be subjected to a critical scrutiny. To an extent perhaps not so much in evidence at universities, the Royal Military College is necessarily concerned with the development of character, personality and loyalty, and it relies upon the total environment to achieve the ends it is seeking, namely, a well trained, well educated officer capable of meeting the exacting professional demands which may be made upon him, often under conditions involving great personal hardship and danger. What has to be determined is whether the present aims of first year cadet training are important to achieve. If so, can those aims be met in some other way, or by the present system so re-organised as to ensure that there can be no departure from the instructions laid down? I have an entirely open mind on the matter at present and, after discussion with the Military Board, I have decided to establish a Committee of Inquiry with terms of reference which have been deliberately couched as widely as possible to ensure that the Committee will not be inhibited in any way in examining the whole philosophy underlying the training of the junior class at Duntroon. The Committee will be headed by **Mr Justice** Fox, a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. Members will be: **Dr A.** M. Sinclair, consulting psychiatrist; Professor L. C. F. Turner, Chairman of the Faculty of Military Studies, University of New South Wales; Brigadier G. D. Solomon, Director of Military Training; and Brigadier C. M. I. Pearson, who has had recent operational experience commanding the Australian Task Force in Vietnam. The terms of reference will be to consider the question of new cadets entering the Royal Military College. Within the framework of the present charter, and having regard to the prime purpose of the College! - the production of professional military officers of the highest quality - and paying due regard to existing prescribed courses, the Committee will be invited to consider the principles on which the training of first year cadets should be based and the methods by which these principles should be implemented. The Committee will also be asked to make such other recommendations on matters relevant to the particular terms of inquiry as seem appropriate to it. It will be obvious to the House that both 1 and the Army have taken the allegations most seriously and every effort has been made to ascertain the facts, to deal with those responsible for the situation which developed at the College, and, equally as important, to take remedial action for the future. Whilst there have been excesses which it is not my purpose to defend - I have not done so in any way - these should not be allowed to obscure the successful part that Duntroon has played in the development of the Australian Army. The Army and the Government are proud of the Royal Military College, of what it has done and will continue to do in the production of officers who will bring distinction to themselves and their country as their predecessors have done over more than half a century. I present the following paper: {:#subdebate-24-1} #### Royal Military College- Ministerial Statement, 25 September, 1969 {: #subdebate-24-1-s0 .speaker-JO8} ##### Mr BARNARD:\n\nBass -- by leave- The Minister for the Army **(Mr Lynch)** has made a comprehensive statement on allegations that have been made about abuses at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Further, he has denied allegations made in Press reports that sadistic practices had occurred in military establishments at Scheyville in New South Wales and the Apprentices School at Balcombe in Victoria. The investigation has uncovered examples of humiliating, stupid and time wasting practices at Duntroon. This has been readily admitted by the Minister. In effect, the allegations of harmful practices lumped together under the general term bastardisation* have been substantially confirmed. There have been serious breaches of a policy directive on the assimilation and regimental training of fourth class cadets. The investigation has shown, further, that these breaches have had a harmful effect on the studies of junior cadets. The Minister has pointed quite frankly to glaring examples of unsatisfactory administration at the College. He has indicated the disciplinary measures that are to be taken and remedial action intended. Wisely, the Minister has appointed a Committee of Inquiry under **Mr Justice** Fox to investigate the whole philosophy of training the junior class at Duntroon. In general the Opposition supports the actions of the Minister for the Army. The Board of Inquiry was appointed after these allegations, made principally by members of the academic staff at Duntroon, had come to the Minister's attention. This was some days before the allegations subsequently were made public in a newsletter published by the Maxwell Newton organisation. These allegations were first raised in this Parliament at question time on Thursday, 16th September when the Minister promised the statement he has just made. The Minister acted promptly and correctly in appointing the Board of Inquiry. He has wasted no time in getting the inquiry finished and taking appropriate action. If the Minister had made an immediate announcement that the inquiry had been set up, the Opposition would have had no criticism of his response to the allegations. It is regrettable the Minister did not do this. Perhaps the honourable gentleman felt these allegations and the setting up of an inquiry might embarrass the Government before the election. Quite frankly, I believe there is little political capital in a matter of this nature. The Opposition has consistently aired similar abuses affecting basic civil liberties in this House. Examples are the treatment of conscientious objectors and the Vietnam water torture allegations. This is why the Opposition drew the attention of the House to these allegations. When the Minister tabled the report of the Duntroon College on Friday 12th September he did not refer to the quite extensive inquiry that was being made into the conduct at the College. He said that such an announcement would have been premature and would have led to prejudging of the issues. The Minister should have recognised the extreme difficulty in keeping secret an investigation involving over 100 witnesses. These difficulties are reinforced when the complainants are university academics who are not bound by any tradition of military discipline. I believe that the Minister is sincere in this matter and also that he genuinely respected the feelings of parents with boys at the College, but by trying to hide the inquiry he defeated his own intentions because the inevitable disclosure has provoked a much greater volume of publicity about the allegations than would have occurred if he had announced straight away that the inquiry had been set up. There is one matter that I wish to refer to briefly before going on to the allegations of ill-treatment. This is the widely publicised claim that a cadet had attempted suicide because of such treatment. The Minister has denied this allegation and I accept his denial. The broader allegations refer to a process known as bastardisation inflicted on junior cadets by their seniors. Initiation ceremonies of some form or another have always been part of the life at most colleges, universities and academies of various sorts. The trend has been for the elimination of these practices or the diversion of them into harmless channels. Occasionally practices of this sort are exposed to public attention by spectacular examples of injury or degradation. The most recent case that I can recall was a series of complaints about initiation procedures at a New South Wales agricultural1 college. Initiation rites are probably a harmless enough part of the socialisation process if they are properly controlled. By contrast bastardisation, as I understand its application at Duntroon, is a continuous and continuing process spread over the entire training year and applied to successive classes of juniors. It must be appreciated that what has happened in the junior class in respect of the bastardisation to which I have just referred has been an accepted practice at the College over a lengthy period. This is evident from the inquiries that the Minister has had instituted and from the statements that we now have before us. Therefore there is some relevance in an interjection by the honourable member for Reid **(Mr Uren)** regarding the position of the Commandant in this. There is some relevance in his implied criticism that the investigation could well have included some of the more senior members of the college at Duntroon, and I am referring now to those who comprise the permanent military staff there. This aspect of the inquiry seems to have been completely ignored. Military colleges have traditionally been associated with severity. However, there is no justification for the maintenance of outmoded disciplinary concepts in contemporary institutions of military learning. The practices which comprise bastardisation have been applied fairly generally at comparable military academies. At the famous West Point Academy there have been repeated controversies over the practice of hazing which has been described as the bullying of the junior class by the seniors. The objective of hazing was to reduce newly arrived recruits to a common level. On occasions the practice has become an issue of national concern in the United States with Congressional committees investigating allegations. It was abolished by General MacArthur when he was Superintendent of West Point, but apparently it persists in a much modified form without official sanction. A process very similar to bastardisation seems to have been enforced at Canada's Royal Military College at Kingston in the period between the wars. Apparently it vanished when the College closed during World War II and has not been revived. There is an account of the procedures adopted at Kingston in a book called 'Fight the Good Fight' which gives a harrowing description crf the week in the life of a junior at Kingston. It has been claimed that this account is freely available in the Duntroon library and has been used as a blueprint by the senior cadets for bastardisation. There are two basic objections to the process of bastardisation. The obvious one is the physical danger of many of the practices employed. It is not unknown for initiation rites to end in severe injury and even in death. The less obvious danger is nervous and psychological damage caused by the accumulation of both physical and mental bullying. This can result in severe nervous disorders and even in the complete disintegration of the personality. This may require a considerable period of treatment and in any case the young man will carry it with him as part of his personal memory and public record throughout his life. Not only the cadet but his family feels the consequences in an acute way. A common justification for this sort of treatment is that it steels the individual for military life. However, it should be possible to inculcate the military virtues without recourse to this sort of treatment. The psychological aspects of bastardisation are disturbing because it strips young men of their self-respect and cows them into denying their personal dignity at a time when their personality is still forming. It is probable that traditional bastardisation has been intensified this year because of the academic situation at the College. With a sharp distinction between the upper classes and the juniors on an academic basis, it is possible that resentment has built up; it is possible to feel some sympathy with senior cadets in a transitional period. However, through its association with the University of New South Wales, which has an excellent tradition of academic freedom it becomes even more important that bastardisation be stamped out. Traditional forms of military hazing have no part on the university campus or any institution associated with a university. In general the Minister has acted wisely and there has been no headhunting or searching for scapegoats. The disciplinary actions taken are warranted. In particular the investigation by **Mr Justice** Fox should do much to solve the problems associated with absorbing a traditional military institution into an academic framework. The Opposition supports the firm action taken by the Minister and urges him to tse the full weight of his office in vigorously following this inquiry through so bastardisation' can be completely elimi nated from Duntroon. I would further suggest to the Minister, since an inquiry has been authorised, that a question that was raised with him this morning and which is of great relevance should be considered. What is the position in relation to a student whose parents had to pay for his release from the College? If the Minister wants further information on a number of these cases I will be prepared to supply it to him. The fact remains that the students appear to be the victims of the policy which the Minister himself has objected to this morning. The Minister has assured this House that it is not likely to continue in the future. This is an extremely important issue. If a student was forced to leave the college in these circumstances and if bis parents were involved in unnecessary expenditure even at this late stage, in view of the evidence of the Committee, the Minister should authorise this matter to be investigated to ensure that the parents are compensated. Finally, I come back to the point that I referred to only a few moments ago, that is, the position of the Commandant, which was raised by way of interjection by the honourable member for Reid **(Mr Uren).** It appears that the inquiry will bring to an end the situation that has existed over a long period at the Royal Military College at Duntroon. I think that probably some of the more senior officers at the college have in the past condoned the bastardisation which has been carried out at the College. This is a matter that should be further considered by the Committee of Inquiry which the Minister has authorised. The perversion of military discipline in this way is completely counter-productive to the efficient and harmonious functioning of the armed Services. The principle of higher education for Army officers to equip them for modern military situations has been accepted, but academics will not accept military education if the practices substantiated by the investigation are continued. *Bv* Macleay - I seek leave to make a short statement Mir DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mon. **Sir William** Ilaworth) - Is leave granted? {: .speaker-KDO} ##### Mr Erwin: -- No. {: #subdebate-24-1-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER: -- Leave is not granted.

I seek leave to make a short statement. {: #debate-26-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER: --Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. {: .speaker-JYO} ##### Mr CLEAVER: **- Mr Deputy Speaker,** the One Hundred and Thirteenth Report relates to the report of the Auditor-General for the financial year 1968-69. Your Committee would again pay tribute to the Auditor-General and his staff for the sustained effort they have made over many years to present the report to the Parliament during August. This practice has facilitated greatly the work of your Committee in this important area of its work. Due to the pending election, your Committee's inquiry this year covered only four matters involving three departments and constitutes one of the smallest of the inquiries conducted in thisfield in recent years. The matters examined in this inquiry covered the purchase of vehicles and amplifiers by the Department of the Army; the acquisition of interim search and rescue craft by the Department of the Navy and deficiencies that had occurred in drawing accounts administered by the Department of Social Services. The evidence taken in respect of the purchase of vehicles and amplifiers by the Department of the Army has, in each case, disclosed circumstances which your Committee finds most disturbing. The evidence reflects, among other things, a compelling need for the Department's acquisition requirements and procedures relating to the payment for equipment to be reviewed as matters of urgency. The records maintained in the Department's stores depots, systems relating to the initial ordering of equipment, audit review arrangements and the adequacy of its communications also require close examination. Your Committee regards the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the interim search and rescue craft by the Department of the Navy as most unsatisfactory and believes that the Department has a clear responsibility to ensure that they are not repeated in other areas of its administration. While it appears that the deficiencies that occurred in the drawing accounts operated by the Department of Social Services have been virtually overcome, some of the evidence reflects inadequate standards of past performance in the Department's accounting operations. Your Committee's decision to limit the area of its inquiry this year has inhibited inquiry into a range of matters which, in other circumstances would have led to public examination. Your Committee would therefore, refer its successor Committee to other matters mentioned in that report, for evaluation in the context of further public scrutiny. Honourable members will recall that in its Eighty-Ninth Report your Sixth Committee established the helpful practice of a Committee, at the close of its term, reporting to the Parliament upon its overall programme, the situation regarding work in progress and any problems which could affect the Committee appointed in the succeeding Parliament. The One Hundred and Fourteenth Report follows the procedure adopted in 1966. In particular it relates to changes in Committee personnel, Committee policy, the programme for the 3 years 1967 to 1969, Treasury minute procedures, annual estimates of expenditure, Committee facilities, assistance provided by the Auditor-General, the Public Service Board and the Department of the Treasury, Committee staffing and the state of the present work programme. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the level of activity achieved by your Committee. As one measure of this increase, it might be noted that in the 11 years from 1953 to 1963 inclusive, 63 Public Accounts Committee reports were submitted to the Parliament. By comparison, no fewer than 51 reports were submitted during the 6 years from 1964-1969. The increased activity, however, has brought problems associated with the staffing establishment of your Committee and, more recently, the existing committee rooms have proved inadequate for the purposes of public inquiries. Your Committee reports that the early rising of the Parliament, coupled with the staffing problems referred to has precluded reports from being presented in connection with our inquiry into the Advance to the Treasurer and the Consolidated Revenue Fund and our inquiry into the Department of Shipping and Transport. These reports, your Committee must refer, reluctantly, to its successor Committee in the Twenty-Seventh Parliament. I "
