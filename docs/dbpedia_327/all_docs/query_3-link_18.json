Federal OSHA guidelines require asbestos testing be performed before renovation or demolition of buildings of any age. Techtron offers customers a one-stop solution to all asbestos-related matters, from preliminary consultation to surveys and sampling, testing, and results – all on site and delivered within a few hours.\n\nIf you would like to send us a sample for testing, please fill out a Chain of Custody (COC) form and drop it off or mail it in. Techtron Environmental Solutions also has licensed inspectors available for collecting samples at your location.\n\nLead paint was commonly used in the United States until it was outlawed for residential use in 1978. Techtron uses XRF testing to perform lead-based paint inspections and risk assessments. Lead-based paint inspections tell you the lead content of every different type of painted surface in your home (not if there is a hazard or how you should deal with it). Risk assessments tell you if there are any sources of serious lead exposure (such as peeling paint and lead dust) and what actions to take to address these hazards. Techtron offers customers a one-stop solution to all lead-related matters, from preliminary consultation, testing and results – all on site and delivered within a few hours. Mail in samples are available too. If you would like to send in a sample for testing, please fill out a Chain of Custody (COC) form and drop it off or mail it in."
