        "text": "My '99 Montana is coming up on 90,000 miles. I have always used high quality gasoline ( Shell, Mobil, Texaco) and have been a stickler for 3,000 mile OCI's ( this is the \"Mom Mobile\" and she uses it for non-highway short haul trips 90% of the time). It gets injector cleaner at every OC and a fresh PCV valve every year. I put in a K&N last year.\n\nI have been thinking that \"The Blue Bomber\" may benefit from either Sea Foam or Chevron Techron Fuel System Cleaner. (Auto Rx may be overdoing it b/c I dont think that there is any fatal sludging ).\n\nIs there any clear advantage to using Sea Foam [crankcase and fuel tank ]vs. Techron? Would using either be \"overdoing\" it considering that it is running pretty well. I would like to get 200.000 out of it if I can.\n\nNever tried Techron, but I did try Seafoam very recently and I was very pleased with the results. Peformance improved, gas mileage went up at least 2 mpg and the engine is running very smooth.\n\nI put one can in the oil and two in the gas tank and ran it almost till I ran out of gas. Changed the oil and put in a mix of Redline, Mobil 1 and Rotella T and a Pure One filter.\n\nI've tried Chemtool and several of the house brand injector cleaners over the years and nothing was as dramatic as the Seafoam. I've also tried Lucas fuel treatment. I heard about Seafoam here at BITOG and I'm gald I did. My only complaint is that it's dam expensive.\n\nI keep reading about Lube Control and Neutra and I will definitely try both of them, but it would be alot easier if I could just walk into a store and buy them. Lube Control is first on the \"to try\" list because it's so economical to use.\n\nSorry, I'm not a fan of adding Seafoam to the gas tank as a cleaner in fuel injector systems. From previous discussions here, Seafoam is basically lite mineral oil, naptha & isopropyl alcohol.\n\nIt is good for removing varnish & gum deposits typically found in carburetors, but probably the best use nowdays is in lawn & garden equipment.\n\nThe basic ingredient in Techron is polyether amine, a strong solvent, and has proven to be very effective at removing the hard deposits found on injector tips, intake valves and in the combustion chamber.\n\nThe detergent adds used in the new Top Tier gas formulations are based on the Chevron polyether amine technology - not on the Seafoam & Marvel Mystery oils typically used in 60's & 70's era automobiles.\n\nquote:\n\nOriginally posted by darkdan:\n\nUsing seafoam through a vacuum line is far superior in cleaning intake valves and combustion chambers than Techron or Regane through the fuel tank. Seafoam through the PCV system or similar vacuum line works two ways:\n\n#1 Thermal Shock. The cold seafoam hitting the hot carbon causes it to quickly contract and release it's kung fu grip on the metal.\n\n#2 Solvency....do I have to explain it?\n\nCould I just put Seafoam into a spray can and spray it into my throttle body directly? I did this with water and it worked.\n\nThe '99 Montana has the 3400 ( 3.4) with SFI. I already changed out the OEM plugs for Bosch +2's\n\nI would have no idea how to do a \"Sea Foam Infusion\" through the vacuum hoses ( correction : I bet that I couldn't even FIND the vacuum hoses ). This engine is packed in so tight and the firewall is so far back that it is a NIGHTMARE to do anything with except change to PCV valve).\n\nI think that I will use Techron or Regane, and Valvoline Throttle Body Cleaner and hope for the best.\n\nFirst of all, like John Browning, I can't find Regane anywhere! I see all other Gumout products, though!\n\nTwo people who I know have just recently used Sea Foam on their oil-guzzling Audis (2.8 V6) with success! Both used the brake booster hose to get the Sea Foam in, and both added some to the crankcase. Oil consumption in both cars has dropped dramatically. One has gone 2k miles without noticeable consumption, while it consumed 1 quart every 1k miles before he used Sea Foam!\n\nStorm - seafoam already comes in a spray can. It's called \"Deep Creep.\" It works great! It comes with the little red plastic tube you can attach to the sprayer and shot it anywhere. I have had very good results with Seafoam. Used it on an old Case tractor and that bugger is running like new now. Used it in my '96 GMC truck, (one can to the gas tank), and all hesitation is gone."
