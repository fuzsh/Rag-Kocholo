        "text": "The Project\n\nThis customer came to Severna Operations with a 2D CAD drawing of an insulator for the connector industry. Techtron PPS are inherently flame retardant and have electrical properties making them ideal for insulator applications. The design also required custom tooling to finish production.\n\nThe Severna Solution:\n\nMachining Techtron PPS\n\nWe used our CAM Swiss Machining capabilities to transform Techtron PPS into an insulator within tolerances of ±.0005”. The part had a diameter measuring .130” in diameter down to .090” in diameter and required two primary operations: turning diameters and stop spindle & slot. We used hand and cryogenic deburring to ensure perfect finishing, followed by stringent inspections for accuracy.\n\nWith over 70 years of experience manufacturing precision plastics, we have the processes in place to keep your project within tight tolerances and within your required timeline."
