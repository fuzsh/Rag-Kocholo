        "text": "Summary\n\nTimber moisture meter used to assess the moisture content of kiln dried timber, manufactured between 1950-1969, and used at the Foresta Timber Mills Pty Ltd from approximately 1950 to 1971.\n\nThis device was used to test the moisture in timber milled by Foresta Timber Mills Pty Ltd (FTM). Foresta Timber Mills was established on 3 August 1940 by Oscar Leshnitzer, who arrived in Australia in 1939 as a refugee from Germany. The kiln drying of timber in the 1950s and 1960s required the use of these devices to ensure the correct moisture content for timber milled for construction and ensure that there was no shrinkage of the timber.\n\nOscar Leschnitzer (who later changed his name to Lesh) previously lived in Gliewitz, a town in the Upper Silesia region of Germany. The town is close to Kracow in present day Poland. Oscar operated a substantial timber and coal enterprise in the region but was forced to make an exchange with the Nazis: his business for his freedom. Oscar's son Gunter joined the family business after he migrated from Switzerland in 1945 where he had been studying a PhD in Economics at Zurich University.\n\nFTM was the natural continuation of Oscar's previous activities in Germany. It was established mostly with capital he brought to Australia. Oscar and Gunter negotiated contracts with the Victorian Government for logging rights in the Central (Nudgee) and Western (Cann River) Victoria. The company also purchased timber from elsewhere in Victoria and interstate. A mill was set up at the North Fitzroy railway siding behind the old Brunswick Oval. Most of the timber was processed where it was logged, then transported to Fitzroy and cut to length for customer orders. FTM sold many types of timber that were mainly used for housing. This included pine and other softwoods and hardwoods.\n\nFTM was sold to Alstergren Holdings Limited in 1971. Alstergren was acquired by Timber Holdings Limited in 1977, who were subsequently acquired by Pyneboard Pty Ltd (1988), who finally were acquired by CSR.\n\nThe Timber Tester was found under a desk at Gunter's home in Caulfield. Gunter passed away in 2008.\n\nPhysical Description\n\nTimber box with leather carrying strap, 2 swivel locks and 8 rubber feet. Corners are constructed with fine box joints. 2 hinged doors.

A square plate, fixed to the panel by screws, has three 3/4 circle lines labelled A, B & C and a central knob to manually set the location of the marker line (set into clear plastic). This plate is printed at the top with 'MOISTURE %' and 'DOUGLAS FIR'. At the bottom 'Techtron Timber Moisture Meter'. At the lower left of the panel is a manually operated dial knob to be at Off, A, B & C. To the lower right a similar knob to be at Zero or Set.
