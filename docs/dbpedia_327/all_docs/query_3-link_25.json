        "text": "Overall rating:\n\nThe Techtron Pro 3500 is a lightweight, compact, and easy-to-use e-scooter targeted at new or commuter riders. It features all of the same creature comforts as the larger Elite 3500 and the Ultra 5000, but in a slightly smaller frame – and a significantly smaller price tag, a minuscule £299.\n\nThe Pro 3500 is built with daily use in mind – and I think it hits that bullseye with ease.\n\nGood for:\n\nNew riders\n\nCommuter riders\n\nShorter or younger riders\n\nUrban riding\n\nPros\n\nCompact frame\n\nEasy to use\n\nPrice!\n\nCons\n\nSlightly reduced ride quality\n\nSmaller honeycomb tyres (8.5”)\n\nNarrow footplate\n\nExpert verdict\n\nThe Techtron Pro 3500 is an excellent scooter for young, newbie, or commuter riders. I found it to be a no-fuss, easy-to-use, and practical electric scooter that sits as a perfect gateway e-ride for those looking to electrify their mobility.\n\nComponents + build quality Safety + security Performance + handling Comfort + practicality Overall rating\n\nI would go as far as to say this would be my first recommendation to anyone looking to get an e-scooter – and with that price you it’s nigh on impossible to find a competitor that offers more for less.\n\nYou don’t need to save for months, remortgage your house or sell your valuable modern art collection, it’s quite simply one of the most accessible electric scooters on the market today.\n\nThat being said, I did have some minor aversions which predominantly revolve around the ride quality which, in comparison to larger or more expensive scooters, I felt was lacking.\n\nThe four star rating comes as a result of the simply unbeatable value for money, did I mention it only costs £299?\n\nSpecs\n\nMax speed 25 km/h Max distance 25 km Motor power 350 W (Avg) 700 W (Peak) Speed modes 2 Cruise control Yes Charging time 5-6 Hours Battery capacity 37V 7.5Ah Hill incline 15% Water resistance IPX4 Wheel type Puncture-proof honeycomb, anti-skid Wheel size 8.5\" / 25.4cm Weight 11.8kg Foldable Yes Folded dimensions 440 x 1100 mm Unfolded dimensions 1080 x 1100 mm Maximum load 120 kg / 19 st Recommended age 16+ Years Drive type Front wheel drive Brakes system E-ABS front brake / rear disc brake Kick stand Yes Accelerator control Thumb press Brake control Lever Handlebar grips Rubber Front light LED Rear light LED Reflectors Yes Bell Mechanical Mudguards Yes\n\nThe Techtron Pro 3500 in detail\n\nPerformance\n\nThe Techtron Pro 3500 is far from a performance-based electric scooter – but that isn’t an issue. It offers a simple, predictable and confidence-inspiring ride that will suit anyone.\n\nIt features two different power modes, combined with 350W and weighing in at a mere 11.9kg, I felt the Pro 3500 had good pickup and responsiveness, it also has that satisfying ‘nippiness’ (technical term I can assure you).\n\nWith a slightly smaller battery than the Elite 3500, 37V 7.5Ah compared to 10Ah, the Pro 3500 offers a maximum range of only 25km/15mi. I do think that’s ever so slightly disappointing, the reality being you’re unlikely to get the quoted range out of any e-ride, so to think you might only get 20km/12mi out of a charge is less than competitive.\n\nHowever, for many, that will be plenty for your daily mileage – simply charge it up overnight and you’re good to go.\n\nOverall if you’re looking for a white-knuckle ride and something that’s really going to have you hanging on, then you’ll need to look elsewhere, if you’re looking for a daily rider that will get you where you need to be with little hassle, you’re in the right place.\n\nComfort and handling\n\nI found the Techtron Pro 3500 to be predictable and agile in it’s handling capabilities – it didn’t wow me, but this scooter offers reliable characteristics which is perfect for new or young riders.\n\nThe handlebars are of decent width, narrower bars do impact stability, but I felt no issues in riding position with this scooter. Compared to the Elite 3500 it does have a slightly shorter stem, meaning your hands are lower down, your elbows at a 90º angle.\n\nOne feature that I think really adds to the riding experience, is the cruise control system. The Pro 3500 isn’t the fastest scooter out there, and so constantly holding your thumb on the throttle can get a bit frustrating after a short ride. Being able to initiate the cruise control system gives you the ability to rest your hand, and ensure you have both hands controlling the scooter.\n\nThe honeycomb anti-skid tyres are great for reducing overall maintenance, however I feel they were at great detriment to the quality of the ride.\n\nQuite simply they don’t have the same squishiness (another technical term) as your typical inflated rubber tyre, meaning that you miss out on some of that suspension that a pneumatic tyre provides. For short rides on maintained routes, like cycle paths, this might not be an issue – but when I rode the Pro 3500 on varying qualities of asphalt I found the ‘road rumble’ through the handlebars and footplate to be frustrating after a couple of minutes.\n\nAdditionally the footplate/deck I felt was a little too narrow for my liking, and wasn’t as grippy as I liked – however, for someone completing short rides I don’t think this would be a major issue.\n\nBrakes\n\nThe Techtron Pro 3500 features an electric ABS front brake and a mechanical rear disc brake, which is activated via a lever on the handlebars.\n\nI found the brake to be responsive, however the handle did have a slightly larger action than other scooters, making it potentially a little more difficult to activate, even more so if you have smaller hands.\n\nExtras\n\nThe stem of the Techtron Pro 3500 folds down and clips into place, and at only 11.9k it can be easily carried and stored tidily in any home, office or garage. The handlebars clip firmly on to the rear wheel fender allowing you to use the stem as a handle for lifting.\n\nI thought the display was simple, easy to read, and displays all the info necessary whilst riding – if you want to find out more about your e-scooter you can download the Techtron app and find out your total mileage, riding time, and access more features.\n\nThe app also displays any sort of error or warning codes to help you diagnose an issue should it arise.\n\nAnother feature worth mentioning is the IPX4 safety rating, meaning the Pro 3500 can be ridden in the rain which really makes it a reliable pic for a daily rider – however, I would advise against taking it for a ride through deep puddles.\n\nThe In-built front and rear lights are bright, however I’m not too sure how effective the front light would be in the middle of the night as it is smaller than on other scooters.\n\nI also found it slightly difficult to turn on via the only button on the display which requires a certain double-click rhythm to activate. I’m sure after spending more time with the scooter this wouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThe scooter is available in five different colours, not really an additional feature but it does add to that feeling of ownership. I’m personally a fan of the orange, but the blue is also pretty handsome."
