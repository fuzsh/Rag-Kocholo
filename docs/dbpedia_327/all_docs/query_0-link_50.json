        "text": "Abstract\n\nVertical profiles of trace metal levels in the water column for 16 oceanographic stations around Tasmania were determined using anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) at a mercury-coated graphite electrode (MCGE), a rotating disc glassy carbon electrode (RDGCE) and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc were determined by ASV, and iron and nickel were determined by AAS. Variation occurred between MCGE and RDGCE results in the samples analysed for cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Statistical analyses of the concentrations found indicated that variations were more likely to be due to procedural blank fluctuations than to change in concentration with depth. For the AAS analyses of nickel, some variation in concentration with depth was apparent after consideration of procedural blanks. However, this variation follows a random scatter pattern."
