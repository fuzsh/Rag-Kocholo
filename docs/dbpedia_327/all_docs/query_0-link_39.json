The diets were characterized with regard to contents\nof protein, amino acid, fat, crude fiber, phytate, zinc, copper, iron, magnesium,\ncalcium, sodium, potassium, tocopherol and metabolizable energy. Six of the proteins\ntested were of animal origin and six proteins used were plant proteins. Each diet\nwas fed at a 20% protein, 10% fat level.",
