        "text": "I had a clogged injector on a car, tried the Techron for about 30 km and didn't clear it, then tried Nulon, which did within a couple of Ks\n\nNot really a fair comparison, as the Techron may have been working slowly and it might have eventually cleared without the Nulon, but I still add a little Nulon to all my vehicles every couple of months or so and I haven't had any problems since.\n\nFound some, it's the Caltex Techron 5000 and after a short ride the bike will now start from cold first stab of the button, that's another problem solved. From what i have been reading all your premium fuels like BP ultimate and the Caltex with techron are fine once the injectors are clean but this bike has been sitting for a while and the fuel had gone off and the injectors were gummed up i think. all good now.\n\nMy cars handbook recommends using a cleaner every two or three months, and when I do I share it between the cor and the bikes.\n\nPremium juice costs around 20 cents a litre more than regular so one tankfull in the car costs just about as much as a premium cleaner, and more than the K Mart product.\n\nI think most are just naptha which is probably worth 20 cents a litre anyway!"
