Inspect the intake valve and ports.. awesome... Really clean. Looks brand new.\n\nSo, its my fav petrol. Even if i use other petrol i will add techron additive to my petrol tank.\n\nyes have been pumping caltex for years\n\ntheir 98 techron and 95 techron got diff also\n\npump 98 if u can afford\n\nReally I only pump the most convenient petrol station.\n\nLast time is Caltex.\n\nBut now is SPC.\n\nIndeed caltex is smooth\n\nSPC is cheap.\n\nNo kiosk how to pump\n\nthat's right, no matter how good, inconvenience is going to put drivers off."
