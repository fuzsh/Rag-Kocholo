        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nWent into Big W today and noticed they're stocking Caltex products now, including Delo 400! I also noticed they're selling Caltex \"Techron 5000'. Awesome, about time this stuff was available after being in USA for so long. 350ml for $15. I wonder how it compares to the stuff in USA? Anyways I bought a bottle and will give it a go tonight.\n\nTechron has always been available in Oz. It's on the shelves at my local Caltex servo, as well as all grades of Havoline, including Delo. I have never seen it at K Mart / Big W though.\n\nThe Techron line was upgraded recently - it used to be a \"one and only\" in a big black bottle. Now there are two choices, Techron 1000 & 5000, I think the only difference is 5000 is stronger.\n\n*Edit* I just checked the Caltex Oz website, seems that Havoline \"Full Synthetic\" 5w40 has been added to the local product list. Looks like it has replaced the Gp 3 Synthetic 10w50.\n\nOh sorry. I didnt know Techron was available at the Caltex stations. Although some did sell Delo I noticed.\n\nAnyways I'm glad the 5000 is the stronger one, as I was pondering on whether it was equal strength with the 'Techron Concentrate' as sold in USA.\n\nBtw, using Techron on long trips is not as effective as stop/go traffic, is that right?\n\nLeo where have you been hiding? T5000 and the weaker one are everywhere. A tip. Find your Caltex distributor and buy a case. A heck of a lot cheaper than the sgl bottles.\n\nCiao...steve"
