        "text": "Selenium used as a catalyst in Kjeldahl digests of plant samples was found to interfere with an automated molybdenum blue technique for determination of phosphate. Interference was prevented by formation of selenocyanate in the presence of excess cyanide. No modification of the apparatus was required and the rate of analysis was unchanged from 40 samples/hr. Reproducibility of the modified technique was good and results were not significantly different (P = 0.01) from those obtained by a manual molybdovanadate procedure.\n\nWe have examined and proved feasible the transfer of a method for blood lead determination, developed and optimized for a Zeeman-corrected instrument, to a continuum-corrected furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Numerous reference materials analyzed with the continuum-corrected instrument gave results within 10 micrograms/L (0.05 mumol/L) at low values and varied by < 6% at values > 200 micrograms/L (0.97 mumol/L). Forty-four routine human blood specimens were analyzed by the same method with both continuum- and Zeeman-corrected instrumentation, and gave results that agreed within about the same limits as found with reference materials. The day-to-day precision was about 1/5 the accuracy results. The detection limit was approximately 5 micrograms/L (0.025 mumol/L).\n\nThe difference in absorbance (delta A) between equimolar acid and alkaline solutions of methyl red, at a wavelength near the isosbestic point of the indicator, is reproducible. Furthermore, this delta A is sensitive to changes in the wavelength calibration of the instrument used to make the measurement. The delta A of methyl red can be used to monitor wavelength accuracy in both manual and automated spectrophotometric instruments. Although this measurement does not establish wavelength calibration, it is useful for monitoring the wavelength accuracy of previously calibrated, automated spectrophotometers that do not easily lend themselves to calibration checks by conventional techniques.\n\nIn atomic absorption spectrophotometer, a reference path may be provided for radiation which excludes the flame. This radiation provides a signal from a detector which varies only with the instrumental drift produced by variations in the radiation source brightness and by variations in detector gain. The signal can be used to compensate for drift in other signals received through a sample path including the flame. In the present invention, radiation passes through the sample path continuously during measurement, and only through the reference path between sample measurements. Movable mirrors shift the radiation between the paths upon externally applied commands. Conveniently, the reference path measurement is made while the flame is stabilized during the change between samples. The reference path measurements are stored and used to correct for drift."
