        "text": "I have been around golf courses my whole life. There have been many phases but little success. Thankfully my petulant club snapping phase only dwelled through my teens, my putting yips came and went in my forties, and I am currently mired in a chipping slump that will hopefully pass before I do. I thought I’d seen it all. Cue last week, and round two of a mixed pairs event that pitches two teams against each other in a hole-by-hole matchplay format. Grateful for a bye in the first round, my partner and I drew a former women’s club champion and her father in the second round. This picture is taken on the 18th hole, which is where the opposition successfully saw off our challenge. Alan Day has been a member of The Kew Golf Club for about 75 years. He played every shot, climbed into every bunker and didn’t miss a fairway all day. It is without doubt, one of the most inspiring afternoons I have ever spent on a golf course. Alan is coming back from injury, a broken his pelvis at 96. He is now 98 years young! Johnny Cash probably had Alan Day in mind when he sang about the need for some “gravel in your gut”. PS I am the one on the right. #positiveenergy #golf #inspiring #ageisjustanumber #golflovers\n\nToday is the United Nations declared International Day of the Girl, an important initiative focusing attention on the need to address the challenges girls face globally and promote girls' empowerment. To mark this day and advance the equally important Inspiring Girls movement with its #thislittlegirlisme tag, we remember our trail blazing, co-founder Luda Duncan who passed away two years ago. “When I started at HydroChem, the influence that a female in a male dominated industry had on our entire team was overwhelming,” remembers HydroChem GM and winner of the 2020 CCN Woman of the Year in HVAC&R award, Christie Deneys. “Luda’s influence spread throughout the entire company. She was known for being a taskmaster and expecting accuracy and high levels of service, but always lead by example.” Luda was born in Siberia, Russia, in 1945. Her father, a fitter and turner, worked in a coal mine after being conscripted to the Russian Army in WWII. Luda’s family moved to Poland when she was an infant where she completed her schooling. She talked about her positive experience growing up in communist Poland – the freedom to join any classes for sport, music, art or dance at no cost to your family. After school, Luda commenced a degree in electrical engineering at Warsaw Polytechnic. The family moved to Australia when Luda was 19. Less than a year later in 1965, despite not speaking a word of English, she started a degree in chemistry at Monash University, using a Polish/English dictionary to translate her lectures. After graduation, Luda worked as an R&D analyst for both Nylex and Varian Techtron, simultaneously authoring several research papers and two books. Luda started HydroChem with husband Neil in 1976 and worked in the business continuously until her retirement in 2015, pausing only briefly to expand her family in the intervening years. “Luda was a very caring and compassionate person,” recalls HydroChem’s National Sales Manager Michaela Toohey. “She saw our business as an extension of her care. She was firm that society was not an economy, and that her business provided opportunity, and looked after people who would in turn look after the company.” Luda provided many employees with discreet care and assistance over the years. She believed fiercely in equality and the ability of individuals to work through any difficulty and succeed in life. Over 70% of girls feel more confident about their future after hearing from female role models. If you don’t know what you want to be when you grow up, work it out along the way. If you can’t yet “see what you want to be”, it might just be that you are the first. The importance of creating a safe, inspiring workplace is as relevant now as it was in 1976. The seeds of equality, gender equity and diversity sown by Luda Duncan then continue to be tended, nurtured and encouraged by those who followed. It is her proud legacy. #HydroChem #inspiringgirlsinternational #IDG2021 #InternationalDayoftheGirl"
