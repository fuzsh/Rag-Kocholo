        "text": "Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar (born 1945) is an Associate Professor in Rhetoric and Public Culture and the Director of Center for Global Culture and Communication at Northwestern University. He is also the Director of Center for Transcultural Studies, an independent scholarly research network concerned with global issues. In 2009, Gaonkar was appointed Executive Editor of the interdisciplinary journal of cultural studies Public Culture, after being in charge of the Doxa section for several years.\n\nGaonkar has two sets of scholarly interests: the intellectual tradition of rhetoric with both its ancient roots and its contemporary mutations; and, global modernities and their impact on the political. For the former, see his essay on “The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science” which was published along with 10 critical responses as book, Rhetorical Hermeneutics (edited by Alan Gross and William Keith, 1995). In the latter categories, he has edited a series of special issue of Public Culture, including Alternative Modernities (2001) New Imaginaries (2002) and Cultures of Democracy (2008).\n\nDilip Gaonkar is a grandson of SAPA. Gaonkar and Venkanna H. Naik. Gaonkar is married to Sally Ewing, the Assistant Dean of the School of Communication at Northwestern University."
