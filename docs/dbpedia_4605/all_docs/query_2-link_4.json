He is also Executive Director of the Center for Transcultural Studies, an independent scholarly research network concerned with global issues based in Chicago and New York. Gaonkar was closely associated with the influential journal Public Culture from the early 1990s, serving in various editorial capacities: associate editor (1992-2000), executive editor (2000-2009), and editor (2009-2011). Gaonkar has two main sets of scholarly interests: rhetoric as an intellectual tradition, both its ancient roots and its contemporary mutations; and global modernities and their impact on the political. He has published numerous essays on rhetoric, including \"The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science\" that was published along with ten critical responses to the essay in a book, Rhetorical Hermeneutics: Invention and Interpretation in the Age of Science, edited by Alan G. Gross and William Keith (1996). Gaonkar has edited a series books on global cultural politics: Globaizing American Studies (with Brian T. Edwards, 2010), Alternative Modernities (2001), and Disciplinarity and Dissent in Cultural Studies (1995). He has also edited several special issues of journals: “Laclau's On Populist Reason” (with Robert Hariman, for Cultural Studies, 2012), “Cultures of Democracy” (for Public Culture, 2007), “Commitments in a Post-Foundational World” (with Keith Topper, 2005), “Technologies of Public Persuasion” (with Elizabeth Povinelli, 2003), and “New Imaginaries” (with Benjamin Lee, 2002). He is currently working on two edited volumes: Oxford Handbook on Rhetoric and Political Theory (with Keith Topper) and Distribution of the Sensible: Ranciere on Politics and Aesthetics (with Scott Durham). Gaonkar is also co-writing on a book on populism with Charles Taylor and Craig Calhoun. Dilip Gaonkar hails from the Ankola region in Karwar district (south of Goa)."
