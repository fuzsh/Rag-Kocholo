This seal, ap- proved on June 26, 1856, consisted of an open book surrounded by rays of light and circled by the words Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Thirty years later Daniel Bonbright, professor of Latin and a member of Northwestern's original faculty, redesigned the seal, retaining the book and light rays and adding two quota- tions. On the pages of the open book he placed a Greek quotation from the Gospel of Saint John, chapter 1, verse 14, translating to The Word . . . full of grace and truth. Circling the book are the first three words, in Latin, of the University motto: Quaecumque sunt vera (Whatsoever things are true). The outer border of the seal carries the name of the University and the date of its founding. This seal, which remains Northwestern's official signature, was approved by the Board of Trustees on December 5, 1890. The full text of the University motto, adopted on June 17, 1890, is from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, chapter 4, verse 8 (King James Version). NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY ^\\Vhatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there he any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 2 Commencement *The appearance of a candidate's name is presumptive evidence of graduation but is not to be regarded as conclusive.

Gaynor 8 History of Northwestern The founding of Northwestern University by nine devout Methodists embodied a mixture of rehgious conviction and secular optimism that is uniquely American. Meeting above a hardware store in the burgeoning frontier towrr of Chicago, these nine men resolved on May 31, 1850, to establish an institution of \"the highest order of excellence\" to serve the people of the original Northwest Territory as established by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota). The 1851 Act of Incorporation creating Northwestern University contained a provision reflecting the strong religious beliefs of its founders but requiring no particular religious faith of students or members of the faculty. Only one of the founders, physician John Evans, was a college graduate. The quintes- sential renaissance man, he built railroads, founded both the Illinois Medical Society and the Illinois Republican Party, and was a confidante of Abraham Lincoln, who appointed him governor of the Colorado Territory. Evans guided Northwestern during its critical early years, chairing the Board of Trustees from the time of the University's founding in 1851 until his death in 1897. The town that grew up around Northwestern was named Evanston in his honor. Northwestern grew and prospered under Evans's stewardship. In 1853 the University bought and began to develop 379 acres of lakeshore farmland. By 1855 the University had completed its first building and opened a College of Liberal Arts comprised of two faculty members and ten male students. By 1869 Northwestern had admitted its first female students; four years later, it negotiated a merger with the Evanston College for Ladies, whose president, eminent suffragette and temperance movement leader Frances E. Willard, became Northwestern's first dean of women. At the turn of the century Northwestern consisted not only of a liberal arts college but also six undergraduate and graduate professional schools, including the schools of law and medicine in Chicago. With the establishment of the Graduate School in 1910, Northwestern adopted the German university model of providing graduate as well as undergraduate instruction, emphasizing research along with teaching. The University's development since then has paralleled the growth of metropolitan Chicago. Today Northwestern is a private research university of distinction, with 11 academic divisions located on two lakefront campuses in Evanston and Chicago; it has approximately 2,500 full-time faculty, 14,000 full-time students, and an annual budget exceeding $1.5 billion. Northwestern's vision of excellence — although faithful to its founding — invigorates a territory far beyond the old Northwest Territory through the accomplishments of its alumni and by virtue of a distinguished faculty and highly selective student body drawn from across the nation and around the world. 9 Schools of the University The Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, established in 185 1 as the College of Liberal Arts, offers the degree of bachelor of arts.

Each school group is preceded by its banner. The formation within each school begins with those graduates receiving the highest degree awarded by that school; doctoral candidates are followed by mas- ter's candidates, who in turn are followed by bachelor's candidates. Following the graduates are the University faculty, trustees, administrators, and deans. The president's party, led by the senior class Commencement committee, completes the procession. Academic Dress Modern academic attire originated in the medieval universities of Europe, where gowns were worn daily to provide warmth in poorly heated buildings and to differentiate scholars from other citi- zens. Two English universities, Oxford and Cambridge, are particularly noted for developing the authentic academic costume, which has changed only slightly through the centuries. In the United States most academic dress follows the general provisions of the Intercollegiate Code of 1895, which was revised in 1932 and again in 1959. Under this code the gowns' trim and sleeve design indicates the level of the degree. The bachelor's gown has pointed sleeves and is worn closed; the master's gown has oblong sleeves with an arc at the bottom and may be worn open or closed; and the doctor's gown, which may also be worn open or closed, has velvet facings down the front and three velvet bars on the bell-shaped sleeves. This velvet trim may be black or the prescribed color of the academic area. The recommended color for gowns is black, although many institutions have adopted colored gowns. Graduates of foreign uni- versities wear gowns of various colors. The style of hood identifies the level of the degree, the school that granted it, and the academic area. Hood length and border width show the level of the degree. The bachelor's hood, which is optional and not worn at Northwestern University, is three feet in length; the master's, three and one-half feet; the doctor's, four feet. The velvet border of the hood is two, three, and five inches wide for the bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees, respectively. The hood is lined with silk in the official color of the school. At Northwestern the hood is lined in purple (the school's color) and gold. The color of the hood's border — and at Northwestern the color of the cap's tassel as well — indicates the academic area. At Northwestern the colors for the Graduate School constitute an exception; tassels are black, but the border color of the hood indicates the specific degree awarded. The square black mortarboard is the recommended cap, although some schools have adopted other styles. Caps are worn throughout the Commencement ceremony, except that men remove them for the national anthem, invocation, and benediction. At Northwestern University members of the following honor societies may be rec- ognized by the honor cords, medallions, and stoles worn: Alpha Sigma Lambda national honor society, burgundy and gold honor cord; Deru honor society, purple and gold honor cord; Eta Kappa Nu electrical engineering national honor society, red honor cord; Kappa Theta Epsilon national honor society for co- operative engineering education, maroon and gold honor cord; Mortar Board senior honor society, silver and gold honor cord; Omega Chi Epsilon chemical engineering honor society, maroon honor cord; Pi Sigma Alpha national honor society, brass medallion with red ribbon; Pi Tau Sigma mechanical engineering honor society, blue and rose honor cord; Tau Beta Pi national engineering honor society, white and orange honor cord.
