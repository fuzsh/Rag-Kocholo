Some, but not all, of the pieces included here were ﬁrst presented and developed under the auspices of this project. We would like to thank the many people who have helped with the various aspects of this project. We thank ﬁrst the organizations that provided the ﬁnancial support for the project when it was only an idea and a string of words. At Northwestern, the Center for Global Culture and Communication, an initiative of the School of Communication; the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Ofﬁce; and the Roberta Buffett Center for International and Comparative Studies provided substantial funds over several years that allowed us to invite and host more than thirty scholars from the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Daniel Linzer, Andrew Wachtel, Barbara O’Keefe, Sarah Mangelsdorf, Hendrik Spruyt, and Brian Hanson, who directed or lead these entities, were continually supportive of the Globalizing American Studies (GLAS) project both ﬁnancially and intellectually. Along with our colleagues in rhetoric and public culture, English, and American studies, they make Northwestern a vibrant place within which to develop new ideas. We thank all of those scholars who presented their work at Northwestern under the auspices of this project for sharing their research, intelligence, and critical acumen with audiences and participants at the GLAS symposia, workshops, and occasional lectures. A grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York allowed Brian Edwards to visit American studies programs and symposia in the Middle East; some of the research from these trips makes its way into the ﬁnal chapter of this book. He would like to thank his hosts in Fez, Morocco; Tunis and Sfax, Tunisia; Cairo, Alexandria, and Minuﬁya, Egypt; Tehran, Iran; Beirut, Lebanon; and Hyderabad, India, for their welcome, their invitations to lecture or lead seminars, and • vii •\n\nContents • viii\n\ntheir generous hospitality. He especially thanks students and faculty at all these locations for their probing and generative questions and comments. We thank two Northwestern graduate students in particular for their assistance: Amber Day, for her energetic organizational work at the three GLAS symposia, and Nathan Leahy, for his intelligent research assistance on the introduction and his help in preparing the manuscript for production. The two anonymous manuscript reviewers commissioned by the University of Chicago Press provided brilliant and detailed advice on the introduction and each of the chapters, which helped us all make this a better book. Late in the game, audiences at the University of Chicago (the Scherer Center for the Study of American Culture), Northwestern University (the American Cultures Colloquium), and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, commented on drafts of the introduction, offering us the opportunity to hone and clarify our argument. At the University of Chicago Press, Alan Thomas, editorial director for the humanities, acquired the manuscript with enthusiasm, made numerous suggestions that improved its structure and content, and moved it through the review and approval process efﬁciently. Randy Petilos, assistant editor, guided this book into production with talent, timeliness, and good humor. Carol Saller, senior manuscript editor, took the reins on the later stages of production. Kathy Gohl was a consummate copy editor. And Siobhan Drummond produced the index with intelligence and care. All of them have our gratitude. Finally, we would like to thank the contributors to this volume for their hard work writing, presenting, and revising their chapters; for their patience as we developed the book; and for the privilege of publishing their work in this volume.\n\nin troduction: globa lizing a mer ica n studies Brian T. Edwards and Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar\n\nthe specter of america Until now, American studies has been conducted under the shadow of the American Century, an epistemological framework and a period of time that have, it seems, drawn to a close.1 Emerging contemporaneously in the early days of World War II and ﬁnding their earliest fruition in the postwar settlement, American studies and the naming of the so-called American Century both drew on and solidiﬁed the mythology of American exceptionalism that had been written into the fabric of the nation well before its actual founding, as far back as the famous call for a city on a hill uttered by the Puritan John Winthrop in 1630.2 The roots of both American studies and the understanding of the twentieth century as the “American Century” can be found earlier in the twentieth century. It seems clear, however, that the particular conﬁguration of American exceptionalism that took hold with Henry Luce’s 1941 Life magazine editorial “The American Century”—which both placed the United States in a line of great empires and distinguished it from predecessor formations—had great inﬂuence on how scholars, students, and citizens would think about the relationship of American culture, society, and the emergent global power status of the United States.3 The myth of an American Century and the mythology of American exceptionalism sustained each other through subsequent decades, even though American studies scholars grappled with them both repeatedly and attempted to free themselves from these narratives by identifying and critiquing their limitations and occlusions. The irresolvable debate over American exceptionalism, with both the insight and blindness that it brings in its wake, seemed to its proponents to have been vindicated by the triumph of the American Century. Its critics, despite themselves, were often caught up in the powerful hermeneutics unleashed by the exceptionalist thesis itself. What is the lure of the exceptionalist thesis? Exceptionalism is traditionally recognized as the logic by which American society and the na• 1 •\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 2\n\ntion itself are seen to be unique. By extension, exceptionalism demands of those who would study the United States both from within and from without a special hermeneutics. Such a strategy, while privileging complexity in analysis sought by “close reading” or by “historicism,” simpliﬁes the work of the critic by obviating comparative analysis. This methodological paradox preﬁgured within the exceptionalist thesis has given rise to an interpretive tradition that is simultaneously resilient and obdurate. In the chapter following this introduction, Donald Pease, arguably the most perceptive and tenacious critic of the exceptionalist hermeneutic, gives a nuanced reading of its resilience and obduracy even as he tries, yet again, to deconstruct it. He begins by posing a decisive question: Is American studies possible after American exceptionalism? Pointing to the historical complicity between the two, Pease shows how the latter enables the former. In his historicization of the logic(s) of American exceptionalism, Pease comes close to disavowing the possibility of a postexceptionalist American studies. He concludes, however, by proposing a comparative analysis of “imperial state exceptionalisms,” a more accurate rendering of American exceptionalism as derived in his essay. Pease claims that Americanists, both U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based (the latter hitherto dominated by European Americanists), are held captive by the exceptionalist thesis. For Pease, this captivity is particularly evident in the work of those who have sought to dismantle exceptionalism as the logic by which a revised American studies might function. Pease begins by oJering a detailed account of three responses (by Djelal Kadir, Amy Kaplan, and Daniel Rodgers) to President Bush’s warrant for a State of Exception in the long aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001; each seems to oJer avenues out of the perpetual bind gridlocking a putatively postexceptionalist American studies, yet each commits the very error it denounces. Pease suggests that we understand Bush’s State of Exception, as advanced through the documents The National Security Strategy of the United States of America and the declaration of a “Global War on Terror,” as a disavowal of the American exceptionalist thesis (which had proclaimed American diJerence in characterizing previous interventions in the global realm, such as Wilson’s “making the world safe for democracy”) and a more conﬁdent reassertion of the American Imperium.4 Asking why Bush should disavow the very psychosocial logic by which the state had interpellated its citizen-subjects into a conceptual framework that both constituted and excluded America’s Others (whether domestic or international), Pease ultimately shows the inescapability of the exceptionalist logic—even when it is disavowed.\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 3\n\nFor Pease, the primary link is between American exceptionalism and American imperialism, although the former continually mutates in his historicist account under the pressures of a rapidly changing world propelled by capitalist modernity. From the early republic and JeJerson’s “Empire for Liberty,” through the mid-nineteenth century’s Manifest Destiny until Theodore Roosevelt’s characterization of the United States as “leader of the free world” at the dawn of the twentieth, to the moment in the twentyﬁrst century when President Bush disavowed it, the putative exceptionalism of America authorizes a series of exceptions made by the state. And these “states of exception” are always seen, in Pease’s account, in relation to the international antagonists of the United States, even when their referents were domestic. Thus, internal colonization and “ethnic cleansing” of Amerindians, for example, should be seen in the light of American conﬂict with European imperialism in the early nineteenth century, setting a pattern that would be modiﬁed and rewritten through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Pease shows how consolidation of the term “American exceptionalism” during the cold war reincorporated varying strands that had operated in independent historical registers and rendered that logic as transhistorical. In the cold war, American intellectuals took a now explicit term, “exceptionalism”—uttered by none other than Joseph Stalin in the 1920s to describe the American Communist Party’s alleged heretical deviation— and turned it into the ground on which American studies as an institution was built. That academic formation would be exported via the Marshall Plan and other post–World War II economic development projects to Europe and elsewhere (including Hyderabad, India, which Brian Edwards discusses in chapter 11), and hence it prepared the terrain for an international American studies that could only be seen by U.S.-based Americanists as secondary or derivative, given the asymmetrical access to resources. Thus when Pease takes as a starting point Djelal Kadir’s 2004 inaugural address to the International American Studies Association (IASA)5—an address that explicitly responded to the Bush doctrine—he shows us how the terms by which Kadir attempted to escape the rhetoric of American “exception” reverse upon themselves. Kadir countered Bush’s version of exceptionalism by claiming that non-U.S.-based Americanists could play a critical role dismantling it. Although Pease ﬁnds much to agree with in Kadir’s statement, he diJers on two key points. First, by simply noting that Kadir resorts to a “good exceptionalism” (“the American Dream,” “authentic America”) to combat “bad exceptionalism” (the Bush regime), Pease makes the tenacious hold of exceptionalism apparent: “Kadir had in eJect guaranteed the Americanness of the International American Studies As-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 4\n\nsociation by reinstituting the American exceptionalism that the Bush administration had abandoned.” Second, and more important, is that Kadir understands Bush’s State of Exception as a new—and thus exceptional— formation (“paradigm-altering,” in Kadir’s construction, because of its shift from earlier, more limited uses of the term to a now planetary scale). In fact, the U.S. state, both in domestic and international spheres, has often relied on a series of states of exception to justify its actions. It follows for Pease that in those moments, particularly after the institutionalization of American studies, U.S.-based Americanist scholars acquiesced with those exceptions either by ignoring them or dismissing them as inconsequential. This is the historical and continuing complicity between American exceptionalism and American studies that Pease critiques. Pease’s magisterial essay may be seen as a cleansing gesture rather than a substitutive gesture. Pease does not expect the whole of American studies to devote itself to his program of the comparative analysis of “imperial state exceptionalisms.” For Pease, American studies is so deeply compromised and contaminated by the exceptionalist interpretive tradition that one has to go through a cleansing process before relocating and renewing American studies. Even the other two critical responses to Bush’s recourse to a semipermanent “state of exception”—by Amy Kaplan, a formidable critic of American exceptionalist imperialism and by Daniel T. Rodgers, the most inﬂuential postexceptionalist historian—are unable to free themselves fully from the spell of the exceptionalist logic. To be sure, Pease is relentless, and his transformative essay perhaps threatens to kill American studies as we know it; his hope, however, is that it may renew it. The cancer of American exceptionalism is so malignant that it can only be cured by the pharmakon he administers. It seems clear that American exceptionalism has served as an enabling matrix for American studies, especially given that in many ways American exceptionalism preceded American studies as an academic discipline. The question is whether American exceptionalism has always already been implicated in some sort of imperial formation, as Pease argues, with the American Century serving as the most recent incarnation of that imperial strand. This historical question, which Pease argues with considerable precision and force, need not, however, be the starting point for this introduction. If American exceptionalism was always implicated in American imperialism, so long as American imperialism does not come to an end, neither will some versions of American exceptionalism invoked to sustain that imperialism come to an end. In this we agree with Pease. But the question we ask is the following: What happens to American studies\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 5\n\nwhen the American Century—which can be variously described, including as an imperial formation, but which always refers to a particular logic of the circulation of capital, signs, texts, and (cultural) goods—comes to an end or enters its longue durée? If the American Century in the Lucean sense is coming or has come to an end, then we expect that the particular link between American exceptionalism and American studies is bound to change, if it has not already changed. The exceptionalist thesis has made possible many sophisticated readings of American history, literature, and society. It provides a basic interpretive grid for what we identify in this volume as the vernacular tradition in American studies. This, the dominant strain for several decades, has provided not only key works in the ﬁeld but the periodization by which American studies organizes itself (for example, Puritan New England as the foundational moment of American society; the American Renaissance as the fount of American culture; and the civil rights movement as a domestic instantiation of progress that might model similar movements for communities organized around ethnicity or sexuality).6 It is not just the fecundity of the exceptionalist thesis, but the cunning of the tradition that has been erected on that thesis, that has been diIcult to disavow. The American Century cannot be critiqued out of existence, even if it renews itself in the guise of a decentered empire, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri would have us believe.7 Instead, it can only come to an end. We need to come to that time when American exceptionalism has to stand alone, in the multilateral world of the global. Indeed, we believe that we have come to that time, or nearly so. Therefore we suggest that the closing of the so-called American Century, less as unit of time than a decided shift in global conditions, signals the weakening of the long and enduring myth of American exceptionalism. American studies, as a result, must yield to a context within which such a formation—of America’s special place and role in the world—requires the bracketing of ﬁctions that can no longer be sustained. The complexity and the challenge are enhanced by the recognition that we are not truly at the end of the American Century but in its twilight. The light that is set on American studies from this perspective oJers a series of refractions as well as (only) a dim visibility. In that twilight, new formations are not yet manifest; perhaps they are not born. We don’t yet know what to expect, nor what the new formations will look like. People today talk about the “new Europe,” the Asian century. Even Luce’s own Time magazine had a special issue titled “The Chinese Century” ( January 22, 2007), echoing a cover story by the same name in the New York\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 6\n\nTimes Magazine ( July 4, 2004). Many others institutionally located within American studies have turned toward the hemisphere as a more appropriate formation. On the West Coast, the movement toward Paciﬁc Rim studies has emerged with force, as has a coincident interest in borderlands. We are all studying dying formations, with their archives simultaneously ossifying and fragmenting. We are struggling to decipher the new formations as they emerge from the debris of eroding traditions and worlds. What prevents us from studying America as a new phenomenon, one among many? The essays collected in this volume propose a series of answers to and cases that address this question; they encourage us to locate the roots of the multilateralism that may already exist in literature and Americanist scholarship, conscious of the contingency of “America” within global circulation. Essays collected here, such as Brent Hayes Edwards’s piece on Ralph Ellison or Kate Baldwin’s comparative approach to cold war womanhood, or Claudio Lomnitz’s transnational perspective on border crossings between Mexico and the United States, locate for us texts and authors not entirely contaminated by the exceptionalist thesis. The chapters in this volume trace variously the emergent consciousness of America as one among many—even with all its imperial impulses—in an emerging multilateral imaginary. Hence, these essays posit a “spectral America” in various circulations, where “America” may lose its referent or exist only as a specter, against Kadir’s ur-American address to the International American Studies Association. The multilateralism that these essays help us to locate and acknowledge is not appreciated in the ﬁeld as constituted and imagined from within the United States—even when U.S. Americanists travel abroad—precisely because the sites wherein America is seen through a multilateral prism are weak (disciplinarily, conceptually, and ﬁscally, in the case of non-U.S. centers of American studies). More than anything else, it is the enduring prejudice of exceptionalism that leads even its most trenchant critics to believe that dismantling or reconﬁguring the American tradition should nonetheless privilege what we call the vernacular tradition. Thus the combination of American studies–American exceptionalism– American Century has served until now as an enabling interpretive matrix that has been able to contain a variety of contradictions, generated both internally by academic inquiry and externally by changing historical conditions. The resilience of this tripartite structure has enabled American studies to contain and defer disciplinary anxieties. We brieﬂy defer the question of what sort of American studies emerges after the American Century by asking what sort of a disciplinary anxiety does our time—the end of the “American Century”—present?\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 7\n\ndisciplinary anxiety Disciplinary anxieties are common. They are particularly acute among those interdisciplinary formations, such as American studies, which are prone to a reﬂexive process of perpetual self-marking and self-constitution in terms of ﬁve key elements: objects, methods, theoretical commitments, the assembling and securing of traditions, and political engagements. Such anxieties, prompted by habitual auto-critique, can be energizing as well as debilitating. The question that interests us here is whether American studies is inordinately more anxious than other multidisciplinary academic formations—which could be oriented around a geographical area (for example, Latin American studies) or thematically centered (for example, religious studies, postcolonial studies)—and whether that anxiety is more debilitating than productive. In the case of American studies, the last category—political engagements—involves both the interplay of contemporary politics of the United States and the ﬁeld’s relationship to the United States as a political entity. It is obvious that American studies has more than the usual share of politics. It is also clear, in the rapidly emerging institutional formations of American studies globally, that American studies scholarship frequently functions in an overdetermined political frame. How are these disciplinary anxieties articulated? There are usually two discursive or narrative strategies that can be found within any given discipline. One tends to be resolutely metacritical; the other is a mixture of ﬁrst-order critical-historical-theoretical practice as well as second-order (that is, metacritical) practice. These narratives might be further distinguished as the founding narrative and the crisis narrative. In each of these narratives, the ﬁve elements around which disciplinary anxiety revolves are diJerently conﬁgured. The founding narrative is generally performative insofar as it is articulated in the course of a critical performance. Such is the case with foundational works of American studies by Henry Nash Smith, R. W. B. Lewis, Perry Miller, and the like, to whom subsequent American studies students and critics have so often turned as models for their practice as well as their metacritical commentary on what they were doing while they did it. In the latter case, prefaces, afterwords, and parenthetical remarks within these foundational texts often yield the decisive clues. So the founding narrative may not even be self-conscious at some level. It may be within the discussions by later critics who read and reinterpret these works as founding narratives, as in the case of Amy Kaplan’s 1993 rereading of Perry Miller’s preface to his 1956 Errand into the Wilderness (which we discuss later in the chapter), or before her, Gene Wise’s 1979 reading of Vernon Par-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 8\n\nrington’s Main Currents in American Thought (1927), or Alan Trachtenberg’s 1978 reading of Henry Nash Smith’s Virgin Land (1950).8 Most often, the founding dimension of these founding narratives is related to the way such works reconﬁgure the object domain in terms of thematic unities, motifs, symbols, styles, and so forth. In the course of reconﬁguring the object domain, such a founding text might also put forth implicitly a reading strategy and explicitly theoretical formulations (which may not necessarily be a full-blown theory, although it is sometimes the case, as with the “myth and symbol” school). In short, the eJect is hybrid or ambiguous. That’s why it comes to occupy the position of a founding text, containing within itself polysemous possibilities. Regardless of how explicit they may be on such issues as topic, theme, reading strategy, and theory, the founding narratives’ achievements remain singularly performative. Their impact is by and large holistic. They could be taken apart, broken down, criticized, in pieces, as succeeding generations do. Nevertheless they retain and cast an abiding spell as totalizing performatives. Crisis narratives, on the other hand, tend to be discursive rather than performative. The crisis narrative is metacritical. It tends to be synoptic, looking after a broad set of internal critical practices against the background of a changing disciplinary landscape. At least in the case of American studies, crisis narratives seem to have emerged primarily from external impetuses, as opposed to the accumulation of anomalies, as in the case of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in natural sciences. To see how this works, let us take for an example Amy Kaplan’s famous deconstruction of Perry Miller’s 1956 preface to his Errand into the Wilderness, itself a foundational text in American studies. Kaplan’s essay “Left Alone with America” may be the most-cited essay in antiexceptionalist American studies work; indeed it appeared as the introduction to a key collection in the bibliography of the ﬁeld.9 In her reading of Miller’s preface, Kaplan shows the tenacity of the exceptionalist thesis. Kaplan brilliantly exposes the ways in which Miller’s own alleged discovery of his project within 1920s Belgian Congo allowed him to write out slavery as the central story of American expansion, visible in his decision to occlude Virginia and westward expansion as the key origins of American history. In Kaplan’s astute account, Miller’s downgrading of Virginia and the slave trade in turn enables the long repression of the African or Africanist presence within canonical American literature. (Her epigraph is of course from Toni Morrison’s essay Playing in the Dark, which had been published the year before Kaplan’s essay.) Kaplan locates Miller’s error in his own “er-\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 9\n\nrand,” highlighting the pun in the word, and focuses on the temporal and geospatial gap between his work on an oil tanker in the jungles of Africa as a young man, where he awakened to “the meaning of America” while participating in the economic exploitation of a colonial African nation, to the “security” of the American academy, where he would later explore the “uniqueness of the American experience” and create a pervasive model for American studies. In her essay, Kaplan proposes three paradigm shifts for new work in American studies, built around signal absences: the absence of the study of culture in historical accounts of American imperialism; the role of empire in the study of American culture; and the absence of American studies within postcolonial studies. The essay was and is a monument in the reconﬁguration of American studies as it grappled with the end of the long cold war. As we look back at Kaplan’s essay from our vantage today, however, the image of Miller’s return to America already preﬁgures every form of diasporic literature that would come to be a dominant strand in new Americanist reconﬁgurations—diaspora as a destination in and of itself. The diasporic writer’s return and her arrival become, as with Perry Miller’s errand in the jungle and his errand in the wilderness, two sides of the exceptionalist thesis. What is fundamentally absent here is the possibility of conceiving of America as a cosmopolitan node, or a turnstile in the global ﬂows, where America is a pivotal but not the singular moment of arrival and departure. So, in the very process of dismantling Miller’s exceptionalist “errand,” Kaplan’s reading unwittingly reinstalls exceptionalism. It dismantles the exceptionalist thesis, as articulated within what we call a vernacular tradition (of which Miller is a foundational ﬁgure), via Kaplan’s cosmopolitan perspective, itself derived from Miller’s own forgotten cosmopolitanism in her essay, only to reinstall the exceptionalism in the image of a return. The same might be said of her larger formulation: that the occlusion of culture in studies of American imperialism and of empire in studies of American culture might be redressed by the two ﬁelds’ mutual consideration of one another. The force of Kaplan’s cosmopolitanism in “Left Alone with America” is the way she refocuses her readers’ attention on the triad occluded by Miller’s dynamic (that is, that Africa is written out as a third term). Yet her famous paradigm shift remains caught within the dialectic of a dyadic arrangement. Kaplan’s reading is an example of a crisis narrative, and one that takes a founding narrative as its occasion. That Kaplan’s crisis narrative—with its slippage back into an exceptionalist logic regarding the diasporic—has become something of a foundational narrative for putatively antiexceptionalist American studies motivates (or prompts) our earlier argument\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 10\n\nabout the ineluctable relationship between American exceptionalism and American Century–era American studies. Kaplan remarks in her essay that she reads Perry Miller’s comments about the relationship of Errand into the Wilderness to the Belgian Congo, “even though his model for American studies has in many ways been superseded.” She does so, she explains with some noticeable anxiety, because “the imperial dimensions of his founding paradigm have yet to be fully explored and still remain in place today” (5). Founding texts such as Miller’s frequently become allegories for the entire tradition. Although there may be exceptions, their structure—if one were to follow Hayden White’s schema—is often metaphoric. Our point in distinguishing between founding and crisis narratives is twofold. First, we note that founding narratives are ubiquitous within American studies. Such narratives wherever they occur are always partially aimed at alleviating disciplinary anxieties. These anxieties may exist and present themselves in a routine fashion at any given moment, or they become manifest in times of crisis, and these crises can be implicit and long developing, or they are explicit and public. Perhaps the best way to enter into this discussion is to engage a speciﬁc problem in which crises are explicit and manifest. This method is useful in the case of American studies because the ﬁeld’s very constitution occurs at a moment of historical crisis, namely, the foundational moment during World War II and its immediate aftermath, as Americans grappled with the newly emergent global supremacy of the United States and what that status might mean for the history of American culture and society that had preceded this moment. Since discussions of American studies are marked by a great deal of explicit discourse about its mission, its location, its tradition, and so forth, we are led to another way of mapping the crisis, one we have pursued in our research for this collection: mapping the crisis in the explicit statements about the ﬁeld rather than routine practice. It seems every major historical or epistemological crisis sooner or later produces two sets of discursive responses—an ASA presidential address at the annual gathering and an anthology with an introductory statement. Although there is some important gap between the two forms, one can map fairly consistently how each key crisis moment has elicited a forceful response from the presiding president of the ASA, accompanied by highly generative responses. These discursive responses propose strategies of containment and suturing devices. Such crises can be generative in two senses. First, most of these crises expand the object domain, but this expansion has to be done in such a way that the disciplinary borders are not rendered too porous that they do not wholly disﬁgure the canon. Second, the crises initiated by new theories or new methodologies\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 11\n\nand reading strategies can be generative insofar as they enable reading the object domain (especially the canon) in a new and transformative way. This happened in the case of feminist theory, for example, in its impact on American studies as signaled by Ann Douglas’s monumental The Feminization of American Culture (1977); or in the case of queer theory a decade later, as signaled by Eve Sedgwick’s inﬂuential rereading of Melville’s “Billy Budd, Sailor.”10 Such crises not only expand the object domain but also deepen the hermeneutic, interpretative tradition. These dramatic moments include the following, to name the major ones: the recognition of African American literature and history as worthy of scholarly research and consideration; the development of (secondwave) feminist theory; the arrival of poststructuralist literary theory in English departments; the multicultural explosion in the 1980s and 1990s; and the acknowledgment of diaspora as a category of experience that undoes an earlier focus on immigration/emigration. If we focus on these, we see the following clearly: the expansion of the object domain, with all the attendant problems regarding canon; and a dramatic change, transformation, or augmentation of reading strategy or method. We can readily see this pattern in the presidential addresses of a number of past presidents of the ASA, such as Patricia Nelson Limerick or John Higham, as they negotiate the challenge of multiculturalism in the pages of American Quarterly, or Mary Helen Washington as she negotiates the challenge of race studies, or Shelley Fisher Fishkin as she engages the transnational turn in American studies, or, earlier, Steven Watts negotiating poststructuralist theory.11 We don’t have the space here to read these in detail as Pease does in deconstructing the president of yet another organization, or as Wai Chee Dimock does in her reading here of Janice Radway’s presidential address, but it is not surprising that Pease or Dimock would choose metacritical crisis narratives, because it is precisely here that disciplinary anxieties are negotiated. If we compared these to the presidential addresses of other academic organizations, we venture that none would demonstrate the degree of anxiety about crisis management as these addresses do. This is also true about the introductions to critical anthologies in the ﬁeld, which are geared to signal, mark, and address these crises, and which have been amazingly inﬂuential in directing the agenda of research. In Caroline Levander and Robert Levine’s introduction to their critical anthology Hemispheric American Studies (2008), for example, the crisis of transnationalism for American studies provokes an engagement with a founding narrative (in this case, an inﬂuential literature anthology), followed by an anxious vacillation between expanding and rejecting the national frame for organizing American literary studies. Levander and\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 12\n\nLevine begin their introduction provocatively. Taking on the inﬂuential two-volume anthology American Literature: The Makers and the Making, edited by Cleanth Brooks, R. W. B. Lewis, and Robert Penn Warren at Yale in 1973, Levander and Levine detect an intellectual scandal at the heart of the Yale project, namely, that Brooks, Lewis, and Warren’s division of American literature in their collection bifurcated U.S. writings into the national and the “nonliterary.” For Levander and Levine, this is a scandal because texts by African Americans and Native Americans were relegated by Brooks et al. to “literature of the non-literary world,” a categorization Levander and Levine correctly denote as “oxymoronic.” The two, however, derive a positive potentiality from Brooks et al.’s editorial decision: “perhaps the editors were simply prescient in relegating [Frederick] Douglass to their non-national grouping.” Noting Douglass’s fascination with Haiti as “the only self-made Black Republic in the world” and his championing of the Haitian revolution, Levander and Levine suggest that Douglass’s more recent “relocation from the margins to the center of American literature anthologies should necessitate a rethinking of both the national and the literary.”12 Levander and Levine are surely correct to note the impulse of what we call the vernacular tradition to absorb the challenge of a ﬁgure such as Douglass. But the lessons they draw from this point demonstrate a repetition (through expansion) of an exceptionalist frame rather than a rejection of it. The conclusion they draw is that the “national frame” of the United States is constituted by “complex ruptures,” as embodied, say, in Douglass’s trajectory from a fugitive slave to an abolitionist orator/publicist to a diplomat, and yet endures recognizably with an “overarching shape and texture” (2). At the heart of their theoretical argument is that a spatial encounter with the various trajectories of literary authors emerging from or engaging with the United States—“complex webs of regional, national, and hemispheric forces”—has the potential to disrupt the more homogenizing singularity of “nation time,” which they see embedded in the Brooks, Lewis, and Warren tradition of American anthologies. Their spatializing framework, however, seems to us to fall back into the vernacular pattern of reincorporating that which should fall beyond its purview. Justiﬁed by “webs” and “forces,” Levander and Levine’s argument for the hemisphere as the terrain of interpretation does not “allow us to view the nation beyond the terms of its own exceptionalist selfimaginings,” as they suggest, but rather allows for the expansion of the very model itself. The editors seem acutely aware of this problem, which they restate repeatedly in their relatively brief introduction. Indeed the word “beyond” is a clue: Levander and Levine repeat it twice in the same\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 13\n\nkey sentence—their call to “move beyond the U.S. nation in American studies” (7)—and twice more again in a somewhat anxious repetition of the same construction a couple of pages later. They are of course cognizant of the perils of their position and wonder whether their own project might threaten “a neoimperialist expansion into the ﬁeld of Latin American studies.” Their answer to the question they raise, however, is to disavow the possibility of doing otherwise: “Hemispheric American Studies . . . complicates questions of the nation, and thus raises rather than resolves interpretive problems. [It] can be regarded as a heuristic rather than a content- or theory-driven method; it allows for discovery of new conﬁgurations rather than conﬁrmation of what we think we already know” (9). Although we ﬁnd much to agree with in their passing calls for comparative perspectives and focus on “bodies in motion,” their disavowal of a more certain resolution and the privileging of “heuristic” solutions or methods are admissions of their own refusal to move beyond experiential spatial registers. This is not the place for a full-scale reading of either Levander and Levine’s introduction or their anthology that follows, which contains essays that we may ally with our own project (although we would frame them diJerently, as should be clear, and dispense with the idea of expanding the national framework spatially to the hemisphere, a model that after all imagines contiguity). Rather, our more restricted point is that Hemispheric American Studies responds to a crisis moment, as other inﬂuential anthologies have done in earlier disciplinary crises, with an anxious and metacritical statement that engages a founding narrative as a way to mark a rupture that it would seek to suture. Our own anthology is not likely to be a radical exception to this pattern. All we can hope to do is to proceed with a heightened reﬂexivity in contributing to this genre. Our second objective in distinguishing between founding and crisis narratives is to set the stage for our distinction between the vernacular and cosmopolitan traditions in American studies. We align the founding narrative with the vernacular tradition, and the crisis narrative with both vernacular and cosmopolitan traditions. We move into an explication of the cosmopolitan tradition because this tradition (which has several diJerent strands) exceeds all the available crisis narratives. As a result, we must take up the cosmopolitan tradition on its own terms. What we mean here is that the founding narratives and the vernacular tradition have a close aInity, and in many ways they preﬁgure the tripartite structure discussed in the ﬁrst section of this chapter. The crisis narrative, on the other hand, while trying to undermine the tripartite structure, oscillates between the vernacular and the cosmopolitan perspectives. On the surface, the crisis\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 14\n\nnarrative may show a strong aInity with the cosmopolitan tradition, but it is rarely capable of resisting the gravitational force of the vernacular tradition due to the privileging of the object domain. This element was key in our critique of Kaplan’s critique of Miller. The one prevailing “method” of American studies has been, from the start, its interdisciplinarity, which is not nor ever has been disassociated from the national narrative of American diversity, or unity within diversity. To this day, American studies scholarship is valued on the grounds achieved by Vernon Parrington so early on in his 1927 magnum opus Main Currents in American Thought: its ability to organize, fuse, and weave together material from surprising or overlooked arenas or archives into a powerful argument or reading. The object domain of American studies has changed over the decades, but the question of the meaning of those objects, despite disciplinary debates, has remained consistent. Even in their critique of the progenitors or presumptions of the ﬁeld, those who seek to break free of the exceptionalist thesis generally replicate and reproduce the multidisciplinary ethos and style valued within the ﬁeld. It is no accident that American studies scholarship often reaches larger publics than that in contiguous ﬁelds: it is often pleasurable to read and surprising in its connections and resolution of disparate problems. The most dominant trope within American self-understanding has been metaphor rather than metonymy—that is, a substitution based on similarity rather than on contiguity or something associated with the object.13 Within what we call the vernacular strand of American studies, the metaphor is the transposition of the exceptionalist thesis itself. The metaphoric unity of America is a distinctive contribution of the vernacular tradition in American studies, and even functions within the resistant strand of American studies. One can easily move from Whitmanian prosaics for American democracy to the most radical critiques of American oppression, and ﬁnd in a variety of ways a reinscription of exceptionalist “unity” wherein things can remain the same.14 What we call the cosmopolitan strand of American studies, in contrast, rejects the metaphoric unity of American experience, and in its place metonymically focuses on the diJerential placement of America abroad. It does so not only because its American interests are so variable as “America” in its various guises traverses other spaces (initially the colonial spaces of other regimes, to the postcolonial spaces under the sway of cold war concerns, and now in a new world order of imperial formation). There is a fragmentedness in the ﬁgure of the American abroad that carries over to the ﬁgure of America or American forms abroad. What do we mean? The American abroad initially has to negotiate with\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 15\n\nother forces that are unfamiliar, from Mark Twain’s and Henry James’s innocents abroad to experiences by ﬁgures as diverse as James Weldon Johnson, Josephine Baker, Paul Robeson, and Richard Wright of diJerent racial formations in Europe or Soviet Russia, to Paul Bowles’s or U.S. Foreign Service oIcers’ encounters in the 1940s with colonial or postcolonial governments and forces. The American abroad experiences a multilateralism, so his or her report back home cannot have a unity in the way that vernacular reports, even in their diversity and multiplicity, seem to.15 In contradistinction to this fragmented quality of America as it travels abroad— the specter of America—is the relative continuity of the political tradition in the United States, the contiguousness of the territory, the progressive strengthening of the political regime, and its ideological grounding in a liberal imaginary, as elaborated by Louis Hartz in 1955.16 The integrating forces in America (economy, technology, infrastructure, media) contribute no less to the concept of unity, even though they may seem to go against some aspects of American exceptionalism. We must therefore focus most of our energy on the struggles within the cosmopolitan tradition. It is here that we come to the distinction between Americans abroad and the specter of America abroad, as mediated by the externally motivated crises provoked by the recognition and development of ﬁelds such as diaspora studies, hemispheric studies, and transnational studies. What is important to notice here is the way the cosmopolitan perspective deconstructs in the course of negotiating these challenges, unlike the vernacular perspective, which incorporates and strengthens itself in negotiating the challenges of the African American, feminist, multicultural, and, slightly later, diasporic moments. One way to unpack the tripartite dialectic of American Century– American studies–American exceptionalism with which we began is to review it in the light of alternative perspectives of the vernacular and the cosmopolitan. The vernacular perspective conﬁgures object, method, theory, tradition, and politics in a particular way, although the object domain has been historically variable and expansive. In literary studies, at least, it begins by discussing (but also naming and reordering) the classic texts. Out of this process of critical rereading, the best-known crises have been successfully negotiated and absorbed. The ﬁeld has also incorporated diJerent genres, from studies of the classic novel, masterpieces of prose, both historical and sociological, and analyses of popular culture (for example, Constance Rourke’s classic American Humor [1931], and Janice Radway’s Reading the Romance [1984]). Through many decades, the trajectory was to reﬁne the American exceptionalist thesis through extensions or elaborations of Frederick Jackson Turner’s 1893 frontier thesis\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 16\n\n(for example, David Potter’s People of Plenty [1954], and Richard Slotkin’s trilogy, Regeneration through Violence [1973], The Fatal Environment [1985], and Gunﬁghter Nation [1992]), especially as we reach into the American Century and the founding of American studies, even though world historical events contributed to the making of the “American Century.” One of the questions that remains to be answered is whether there are any strands—palpable or discernable—within the vernacular tradition which are fundamentally subversive of the exceptionalist mythology or resist the anointment of the American Century. These shadows of an emergent multilateralism are apparent throughout the contributions to this volume. Let us be more precise. When you shift from the vernacular to the cosmopolitan perspective there are two variants. Within the ﬁrst variant are two further substrands: one is the cosmopolitan readings of America, starting with the French trajectory from Tocqueville to Jean-François Revel to Jean Baudrillard to Bernard-Henri Lévy, who wrote about America from the position of cosmopolitan outsider.17 These cosmopolitan works were pulled into the gravitational ﬁeld of “America” by the vernacular tradition and thus disempowered of their potential to disﬁgure it. (Pease shows how this process worked for Tocqueville, tracing the incorporation of the Frenchman’s nineteenth-century study into the arguments of cold war consensus historians Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Henry Steele Commager, and the centrality of Tocqueville to the arguments of Daniel Bell and Louis Hartz.) The French, of course, are not the only “cosmopolitan readers” of the American saga; there are other European variants, including the British variant, which is fairly distinguished, starting with Edmund Burke’s eighteenth-century reading of the American character. What is less known, however, are the interpretations of America produced by cosmopolitan readers from the global south and from the colonized countries—a research topic very much in need of attention.18 Conversely, we place the American abroad, whose trajectory begins perhaps with Benjamin Franklin in Paris and runs to include Henry Adams, Twain, Henry James, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, among others. Such writers initially reﬂected on what it meant to be an American abroad, with a frequently European template against which to reimagine Americanness. But in their works—say Hemingway’s or Stein’s or Wright’s on Spain and France, or the Bowleses’ or William S. Burroughs’s on Morocco—there was the possibility of a diJerent conﬁguration. Future work might ask to what extent this strand has also been pulled into the gravitational ﬁeld of the vernacular, and to what extent work such as this is a predecessor to the diasporic literary imagination, in which expatriate U.S. literature reverses the image of someone coming to the United States\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 17\n\nand writing about their experience. (The signs of this conﬁguration are strong, as in Maxine Hong Kingston’s character Wittman Ah Sing.)19 An intellectual such as Fareed Zakaria, whom we discuss later in this chapter, brings together these two patterns: the latter-day diasporic equivalent of Tocqueville, but a Tocqueville already incorporated by the vernacular tradition. The question is whether in either of these two strands there is anything that is subversive of that which would become the tripartite mythology. This topic has been inadequately explored in part because the European reading of America and the American presence in Europe have been privileged, which has made it diIcult to identify more subversive elements. Although there are many such ﬁgures available—both those who have been written out or ignored (as in Claudio Lomnitz’s piece)—most have been misread according to the Eurocentric perspectives still underwriting American studies approaches to expatriate literature (Brian Edwards’s rereading of the work of Paul and Jane Bowles, through use of a Moroccan Arabic-language archive, has struggled against this imperative).20 Now we elaborate on another variant within the cosmopolitan. This strand is fundamentally recalcitrant to the tripartite mythology. If we want to call the present a global or multilateral moment, we want also to argue that this characterization is fundamentally recalcitrant to the tripartite mythology. Whether such a moment may in the foreseeable future dislodge the hold of the mythology within the vernacular tradition is not the point. The issue is whether American studies can be more than an area studies (or latter-day “civilization studies”).21 What we want to ask is this: how might one imagine a truly alternative perspective, not to displace it but, as we argue later, to provincialize the vernacular tradition? We say that such a perspective is a multilateral one, even a global one. The key to this strategy is to think of America as a collective agent abroad, collective but not uniﬁed by the ideology of exceptionalism. Rather, it is fragmented by the materiality of the capitalist project to which America has become committed, perhaps unbeknown to its own (imagined) soul. This is America global. America global becomes global only by diluting the vernacular, and by substituting “America” for the global. Whether that substitution can be reduced to things such as an “empire without colonies,” or a hegemonic imperium, might be secondary to ﬁguring out how to read the archives of America abroad. What is the American trace abroad, and how does that trace return to haunt the American vernacular? Innocence can never return. The destination of the immigrant and the return of the native, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, on both sides of the Paciﬁc, have been suspended. America is no longer a destination, even though it may seem so\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 18\n\nto many people, as it may have been in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Nor is there the possibility for the diasporic “American” to return to what has been left behind, as was already apparent to Henry James in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, when he returned after long absence from the United States to write The American Scene and found himself looking down at the hubbub of Ellis Island with the shock of the lack of recognition.22 James, having returned to New York, thinking that his comprehensive vision could comprehend all visible things, recoiled in the acknowledgment that there are currents that may be seen but not grasped by even a Jamesian cosmopolitanism. This is our project.\n\nvernacular and vernacular redux Let us juxtapose—apparently at random—another foundational text in American studies, R. W. B. Lewis’s The American Adam, and a recent nonacademic text, Fareed Zakaria’s The Post-American Century. The latter at ﬁrst blush seems to be allied with our own project. The goal is twofold: ﬁrst, to demonstrate how the logics of the vernacular tradition travel and underwrite themselves in surprisingly powerful ways outside American studies proper, even among those not within their gravitational ﬁeld; and second, to show how one may move beyond such logics, which we take up in the ﬁnal two sections of this essay. The American Adam was published in 1955, when Lewis was a professor of English and American studies at Yale.23 The argument of the book is familiar to those versed in American studies: there is an “Adamic theme” running through the classic texts of Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Henry James, and others. According to Lewis, the Adamic theme appears or operates diJerently within poetry, criticism, and ﬁction of the nineteenth century, but whatever the stance the text takes toward an America perceived variously as innocent (for Whitman) or fallen (for Hawthorne), the theme may be identiﬁed. In his identiﬁcation of a theme across diverse genres and manifestations of culture, Lewis allied himself with the academic approach that Parrington had initiated. In this respect, The American Adam was legible as a work in the American studies vein. But there is more. In poetry and criticism, Lewis’s argument goes, the American author claims his literary space within the “shaggy and unshorn” America (quoting Longfellow, 79); in American ﬁction, he experiences the world “as it is,” as a new Adam. For Emerson, for example, the project is “the refreshment of the word: so that it might utter the Adamic secret and contribute thereby to the Adamic career” (77). And this Emersonian call—to be heeded by diverse American poets—was to be in the service of the nation:\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 19\n\n“It was to be a poetic equivalent of the life for which it would also be a revelation, providing, like the Revelation, some clues by which to plot a course of actual conduct” (77). For American ﬁction, less inclined toward the “refreshment of the word” and tending to narrate stories of individuals moving through space, the Adamic theme could be located in that very collision: “American ﬁction grew out of the attempt to chart the impacts which ensued, both upon Adam and upon the world he is thrust into. American ﬁction is the story begotten by the noble but illusory myth of the American as Adam” (89). Although his study focused on the nineteenth century, Lewis identiﬁed the Adamic theme in what he considered to be the greatest twentiethcentury American literature up to his present. In a brief epilogue, he calls his present moment the “age of containment,” a phrase that would stick.24 For Lewis, however, “the indestructible vitality of the Adamic vision of life” (198) remained “uncontained.” Those quiet Americans—and ugly Americans—might thus be summoned to sustain the Adamic vision through the prosaics of cold war. All of this—from the idea of the “new man” from Hector St.-Jean de Crèvecoeur, to the American as “new Adam” from Whitman—is of course classic exceptionalism, an alluring admixture of memory and desire to project a national fantasy. In that occlusion, Lewis relied heavily on Emerson’s binaristic oppositions—“the party of the Past and the party of the Future,” or the parties “of Memory and Hope, of the Understanding and the Reason” (7). What is of consequence, almost revelatory, in Lewis for our purposes is not so much his version of American exceptionalism, but how he developed it through method, a method at the heart of American studies. For Lewis, those “special complexities, the buoyant assurance, and the encircling doubt of the still unfolding American scene” (198) did not by themselves constitute what is exceptional. Rather, they had to be identiﬁed by a critical method specially attuned to analyzing them in their complexity, even as they continue to “unfold.” Lewis’s crucial prologue—“the myth and the dialogue”—advances the methodological argument: I want, ﬁrst, to suggest an analogy between the history of a culture—or of its thought and literature—and the unfolding course of a dialogue: a dialogue more or less philosophic in nature and, like Plato’s, containing a number of voices. Every culture seems, as it advances toward maturity, to produce its own determining debate over the ideas that preoccupy it. . . . The debate, indeed, may be said to be the culture, at least on its loftiest levels; for a culture achieves identity not so much through the ascendancy of one particular set of convictions as through the emergence of its peculiar and distinctive dialogue. (Simi-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 20\n\nlarly, a culture is on the decline when it submits to intellectual martial law, and fresh understanding is denied in a denial of further controversy.) . . . Or to put it more austerely: the historian looks not only for the major terms of discourse, but also for major pairs of opposed terms which, by their very opposition, carry discourse forward. (1–2)\n\nAlthough Lewis perfunctorily concedes that every culture as it matures tends toward a culture of debate/dialogue, the reliance on antimony, opposed terms, and the debate over them as the key to understanding national “identity” is presented as distinctively American (in the absence of a comparative frame). This rendering of Americanness as dialogic, easily translatable into the idiom of liberal pluralism, which would privilege process over substance (the “just” over the “good”), was destined to become far more consequential than the particulars of Lewis’s now outmoded sense of American innocence. Although Lewis’s book could only be taught today as a document in the history of the ﬁeld, it would be eminently possible to have the paragraph just quoted serve as a methodology in most of what happens in the current work in the ﬁeld. In its focus on the debate over culture (and marking debate as the very structure of American culture, and its absence as “intellectual martial law”), we associate Lewis’s method with Gerald GraJ’s argument for “teaching the conﬂicts” in his 1992 work Beyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conﬂicts Can Revitalize American Education. In the method and logic Lewis promulgated in The American Adam, American studies, which generally takes an oppositional stance toward mainstream American values and social politics, ﬁnds its critical starting point. The conﬂicts and oppositions that mark much of American history and society are critical loci of much of American studies conducted within the now ﬂexible borders of the American framework—be they the continually contested borders of the United States or the various extended groupings (hemispheric, transatlantic, and the like) that now animate new work. Yet as Alan Filreis, an important American studies scholar of the cold war, pointed out in his review of GraJ’s book, the cold war context for such an argument runs deeply through a position such as GraJ’s and asks us to reconsider the logic of what seems to be a “conﬂict” position emerging from the left, namely, that “intellectual extreme opposites ‘need’ each other to make their positions meaningful.”25 In Filreis’s characterization, this conﬂict position is a binarism that Filreis allies to the anticommunist and antianticommunist debates of the 1950s. There is much insight in Filreis’s point. We must go even further, since one could extend the binarisms of the early cold war to an apparent engagement with the rest of the world\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 21\n\nthat fell outside the U.S.-Soviet/capitalism-communism epistemologies of that period, within which Lewis and GraJ alike were caught, even though GraJ was writing in its twilight. As we will show, however, most clearly in the case of Fareed Zakaria, opening up the frame to a larger perspective does not eliminate binarism. Lewis’s invitation to focus on the debate over cultural identity as a way to understand and chart it leads to an incessant replication—from “teaching the conﬂicts” classrooms to democratic deliberation in the public sphere, both eminently exportable—and the subsequent reiﬁcation of the idea of debate itself. That such an ontologized method emerged from The American Adam in tandem with the argument about the “new Adam” is important. Lewis’s new approach to understanding American complexity— the crossing, fusing, and defusing of dissonant voices—emerged as the methodological “new Adam.” Thus, Lewis’s method is more than an elegant and optimal way to enter and to decipher the “special complexities” of the American soul; it is the American soul, dialogic and democratic. For Lewis, this approach would require repositioning the great bard of democracy, Whitman, in the service of the method: The American myth, unlike the Roman, was not fashioned ultimately by a single man of genius. It was and has remained a collective aJair; it must be pieced together out of an assortment of essays, orations, poems, stories, histories, and sermons. We have not yet produced a Virgil, not even Walt Whitman being adequate to that function. Leaves of Grass (1855) did indeed set to a music of remarkable and original quality many attitudes that had been current for several decades. . . . But Leaves of Grass is scarcely more than a bundle of lyrics which gives us only one phase of the story imbedded in the American response to life; to round it out, other writings had to follow. (4–5)\n\nTo write about Whitman in this vein, particularly on the centenary of the ﬁrst edition of Leaves of Grass, was a radical gesture. In place of the close investigation of the individual work, Lewis’s proposal was that the investigation of the fabric of dialogue emerging from many individual works was the work of American studies, and a major reason that The American Adam is a foundational text of American studies. Lewis’s critical work deposes Whitman’s Adamic voice from its centrality, and originality, and replaces Whitman with the critical work that gathers a Whitmanian unity in diversity. What happens when this dialogic method, conceived within American studies, goes public, goes global? Consider what President Obama, the most rhetorically gifted proponent of American exceptionalism in recent\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 22\n\ntimes, said in his widely watched (thanks to YouTube, Facebook, and an assortment of Iranian blogs) video address to the Iranian people on Nowruz 2009 (Iranian New Year). This video address discloses the power and cunning of the exceptionalist thesis far better than does Obama’s eloquent but routine invocation of the exceptionalist trope, in his Grant Park (Chicago) speech on the night of his election, to account for and celebrate his historic victory, with Oprah Winfrey and Jesse Jackson visibly in tears in the audience. (In a similar vein, even Obama’s opponent John McCain and his predecessor George W. Bush celebrated his victory with recourse to the exceptionalist trope, though without the tears.) Unlike the inaugural trope of the Grant Park speech, open to empirical questioning—“If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer”— the governing trope of the video address is more serviceable and almost irrefutable. It is a call for dialogue within diJerence, and an invocation of a sense of “shared humanity” despite antinomous positions: “In this season of new beginnings I would like to speak clearly to Iran’s leaders. We have serious diJerences that have grown over time. My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community. This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect.”26 The antinomy between Iran and the United States—on diplomatic or state level—is reimagined as containable within “clear” and “honest” dialogue. Obama goes on to suggest that this newly reimagined dialogue of antinomous poles can lead to a peaceful future, but tellingly it is a “future that we seek” (emphasis added): “So on the occasion of your New Year, I want you, the people and leaders of Iran, to understand the future that we seek.” Note the shift from “your” to “you” to “we” in the sentence. Obama continues: “It’s a future with renewed exchanges among our people, and greater opportunities for partnership and commerce. It’s a future where the old divisions are overcome, where you and all of your neighbors and the wider world can live in greater security and greater peace.” What’s American about this future is not simply that “we seek” it, but that it reembraces the very debate that Lewis had identiﬁed as a method, as an American solution. Obama’s conclusion is in this regard telling and even chilling: “I know that this won’t be reached easily. There are those who insist that we be deﬁned by our diJerences. But let us remember the words that were written by the poet Saadi, so many years ago: ‘The children of Adam are limbs to each other, having been created of one essence.’ ”\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 23\n\nObama recasts the idea of ineluctable diJerence in a new framework: one of discussion, engagement, “commerce” that can admit, embrace, and master diJerence. The pronominal movement from “your” and “you” to “we” is reversed in the address’s concluding line by moving back to a “your”: your poet Saadi. Yet Obama’s quotation from Saadi, the thirteenthcentury Persian poet, is more than an apparent dialogue on Iranian terms, in Persian language (although he quoted Saadi in translation, Obama closed with a holiday greeting in good Persian). The quotation of Saadi is of course a line that sounds particularly Emersonian or Whitmanian given our discussion in this section. Saadi was indeed a poet particularly important to Emerson, one Emerson read (in translation), wrote about, and even dedicated a poem to (“Saadi” [1842]).27 Obama’s quotation of Saadi is a quotation ﬁltered through Emerson and Whitman and returned back to Iran as a lesson learned from its own tradition informing a future that “we” Americans—new Adams, children of Adam—seek. Returning to R. W. B. Lewis as paradigmatic, we ﬁnd it is this debate—with constructed binaristic sides pro and contra, as if two positions could contain everything—that liberal Americans export as exceptional. (See Kate Baldwin’s contribution to this volume on the ways in which the Nixon-Khrushchev “kitchen debate” in 1959 may proﬁtably be seen from a comparative perspective, one that interrupts Americanist understandings of the very “kitchen” itself as domestic, feminized space.) In the same way, for President Obama or for public intellectuals such as Fareed Zakaria, both of whom announce and prepare us for the coming of a “post-American world,” the American voice remains preeminent in the dialogue of nations. It is the voice that recognizes and resonates with other voices, for it is the voice of reason itself forged within an ongoing internal dialogue. As opposed to a room full of voices that do not connect, which are cacophonic (as they are in some American versions of the United Nations), the American voice—in the very act of enunciation— sets the protocols for deliberation and debate drawn from the long career of the United States as a democratic nation, and more so a democratic culture. What is impossible from such a position is to imagine that the American voice could just be one among many, one that could as easily not be heard or not resonate in certain parts of the world. Privileging America as the sounding board, America always the mediator even within a “postAmerican world,” cannot recognize a world within which the voice does not echo back. In this national fantasy of the global, as in the old image of RCA Victor, “his master’s voice,” the world listens when America speaks. America is both the primal speaking subject and the ultimate addressee, the essence of sovereignty in the dialogic mode.\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 24\n\nWhat if this is no longer the case as the American Century draws to a close? Even among the critical or oppositional strand of American studies, it is diIcult if not impossible to imagine this lack of resonance. Thus important studies of “circulation” (especially, in this collection, the chapters by Larkin, Thompson, Sakai, and Brian Edwards) are misread if readers do not perceive the ways in which the circulation of an American voice or form may be diverted oJ pathways imagined by the logocentric power. Let us now turn brieﬂy to Fareed Zakaria’s 2008 best seller The PostAmerican World.28 (Intriguingly, in May 2008, while on the campaign trail, Barack Obama was photographed holding the book, with his ﬁnger marking a page about halfway through.)29 Zakaria, we need hardly say, is not someone associated institutionally with American studies. Since 2000, he has been editor of Newsweek International (thus overseeing its international editions, with a readership estimated at 24 million), former managing editor of the stalwart Foreign AJairs, a regular columnist for the Washington Post and the domestic edition of Newsweek, and now host of a weekly CNN television program on foreign aJairs. Zakaria has made his name from widely circulated opinion pieces on the changing world order, from his best-selling book The Future of Freedom (2003) to his Newsweek cover story “Why They Hate Us” (October 2001), published in the immediate aftermath of the events of September 11. Rereading The Post-American World, his latest and possibly most inﬂuential text, less than a year after its initial publication, much of it seems embarrassingly wrong. For example, Zakaria spends much of his long second chapter (“The Cup Runneth Over”) discussing the apparent paradox that despite the palpable increase in global violence, the global economy is stable. (He argues too that in fact “the times we are living in [are] . . . in historical context, unusually calm” [10]). Even after the devastating global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, which continues to reverberate, Zakaria blithely issued “A Capitalist Manifesto” in Newsweek (September 20, 2009). It is not for this undoubtedly inﬂuential Pollyanna-ish argument about global markets and global violence, however, that we are interested in The Post-American World. Rather we are interested in the way that, even while exposing a part of the world that departs from the American Century (what he calls “the rise of the rest”), Zakaria underwrites precisely the logocentric Americanist vision of the unknown world he would seem to be undercutting. Zakaria discusses how the rise of newly powerful economic nations (China, India, Brazil, Russia, among others) is completely changing the way the world works in every respect, from security concerns to energy and ecology to religion and media—and the very future of liberal democracy. But Zakaria invariably speaks from the American vantage point: “The irony is that the rise\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 25\n\nof the rest is a consequence of American ideas and actions. For sixty years, American politicians and diplomats have traveled around the world pushing countries to open their markets, free up their politics, and embrace trade and technology. . . . We counseled them to be unafraid of change and learn the secrets of our success. And it worked: the natives have gotten good at capitalism. But now we are becoming suspicious of the very things we have long celebrated” (48). This argument is not motivated simply by the rhetorical requirement of addressing a predominantly American readership, including the once and future president Barack Obama. More than anything else, Zakaria’s mindset motivates the argument. Even in a multilateral world, the United States remains paradigmatic. The changing world is not just perceived as a challenge that the United States must master in order to remain preeminent, a notion common to any foreign policy thinking; the implicit assumption is that if the United States cannot master the changing world, perhaps no one can. In other words, the way the United States masters the coming of the post-American world must be exemplary—the most rational, most ethical, most portable. Thus, having initiated its own “post,” the United States must teach the rising rest the protocols for engaging the post–American Century. This conviction is Adamic narcissism. If the Japanese mastered ecology, that mastery would not be portable. If Indians mastered the challenge of religious diJerence, such would not be portable. If Brazilians mastered multiculturalism, that is not portable. If Europeans mastered equitable social distribution, it is not portable. The only way anything is portable, hence universal, is if it is shaped in the United States and succeeds in other “virgin” lands. This impulse is yet another version of American exceptionalism. We cannot undo or even deconstruct the vernacular. We can only provincialize it.\n\nprovincializing the vernacular What is preventing us from seeing the new global order as it emerges except through an American cast of vision? What is preventing a multilateral approach from taking root in American studies? A multilateral approach, we want to clarify, does not mean looking at American studies from every possible angle, but rather from the perspective of shifting critical nodes: Japan (Naoki Sakai), Bombay (Brian Larkin), Cairo and Tehran (Brian Edwards), Mexico (Claudio Lomnitz), Moscow (Kate Baldwin), Damascus (Elizabeth Thompson). To provincialize the vernacular is not easy. The vernacular has an un-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 26\n\ncanny ability to resist the appearance of being made provincial, as evident from its capacity to draw into its gravitational ﬁeld so many themes and insights generated by the cosmopolitan tradition. Tropes of both return and arrival can be absorbed fairly well within the vernacular tradition. Of course that tradition became richer as it responded to these returns and arrivals, but it is notable and striking that critical attention to the diasporic ﬁgure did not palpably subvert or challenge the exceptionalist thesis. The diasporic ﬁgure, as reconﬁgured within an American studies perspective, could in fact be made to underwrite the American Century thesis: the most complex fruition of unity within diversity, playing out Luce’s idea that the entire century might be listed under the column of the American. Diaspora studies, suitably permitted to articulate their angst, as encountered by American studies, could then become yet another strand of multiculturalism. By privileging the trope of America as destination, the vernacular incorporation of diaspora reinscribes the unique path of American democracy from political resistance (against Britain) to socioeconomic redistribution (from the Square Deal to the New Deal to the War on Poverty) to recognition of cultural and other identities of diJerence.30 Within the new formation that we attend to, however, diasporic subjects who arrive in the United States do not come to “America” as a (ﬁnal) destination but rather to the United States as a holding place. If we think of America not as terminus but rather as node through which people are passing, as we alluded to earlier, the enigma of arrival in America is of less interest than it appears within many American studies engagements with the various diasporas traversing the United States. Rather, passing through should command greater attention. “America” is after all—before all—a node in the global circuit, arguably the most important of nodes in the global circuitry. This characterization is not to underestimate the major role that the United States plays in present geopolitical arrangements but to recast it among a proliferating set of trajectories, national, subnational, and regional, that make up the present global matrix. (With the use of nodes, we are nodding toward earlier terms for this insight, including alternative modernities, global cultural ﬂows, and the circulatory matrix.) The vernacular tradition is unable to consider America as node; perhaps it should not. To an extraordinary extent, too, though, much work in what we have called the cosmopolitan strand of American studies has conceived of its own work in terms of return, return of the prodigal, return to the shining city, or a deliberate exile, as in Amy Kaplan’s crucial reading of Miller. This blindness that privileges return as against passing through is embedded in a complex interpretive tradition that can and does produce insight and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 27\n\nHence, at one level the two traditions within American studies will continue, evolve, and productively engage each other—the vernacular and the cosmopolitan in its three or four diJerent strands. From now on, however, they will have to be carried out under the shadow of what we call “America global.” What escapes the vernacular tradition is precisely that collective agent—America global—that is, America as the agent of capitalist modernity. It is not as if within the vernacular and cosmopolitan traditions the theme of American capitalism has not been addressed. There is a distinguished critical tradition of the American Left that has done so. The idea, however, that America global as a collective agent traverses the globe as an agent of capitalist modernity leaves behind traces that have no legibility within the protocols of reading associated with either the vernacular or the cosmopolitan tradition. Not only does America global refuse the lure of the hitherto successful recuperative logics of the vernacular tradition, but increasingly this “America” casts an overwhelming shadow. It is this shadow that we need to study and engage. Unlike Americans themselves, who may return, America itself does not return. Nonreturn is the enigma of America global. The aesthetics of the multilateral are diIcult to grasp. Its archive is vast and disﬁgured—disﬁgured both by its vastness and by a metonymic dispersal that resists unifying metaphorization, and even allegorization. It is an archive that is accumulating at a staggering rate. Its seemingly endless horizons—moving from the republic of letters to cyberspace; interspersed within spaces, structures, and communities, both local and global; inscribed, staged, and circulated, physically and digitally—are clearly far removed from the usual purview of Americanists. This archive is not just the standard archive of cultural studies—music, cinema, television, advertising, and the like. It also includes physical spaces marked as American, even when only their form originates in the United States (big box stores, shopping malls, the American-style campus, the cybercafé); spaces of public deliberation such as the call-in show and the Internet chat room; and a global English increasingly illegible to Americans, propagated in small business institutes around the world and in the absence of principles for codiﬁcation and canonization.31 One can imagine the American studies scholar running for cover against the avalanche of this archive. Stubborn disciplinary prerogatives of American studies have not prepared the current generation of U.S.-based Americanists for this avalanche: (1) the simple but profound blindness caused by the monolingualism or at best the bilingualism of American studies, as signaled in Wai Chee Dimock’s chapter here; and (2) until recently, the lack of credentialing from Americanist research in “foreign” archives—which is still only nascent and gen-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 28\n\nerally discouraged. Further, America global is often agentless, or sheds its agent (perhaps, a version of strategic deessentialism) as it circulates and becomes the logic of the global structure itself: a sort of second nature making critique diIcult. A recognizably American form in circulation—a McDonald’s in Moscow or Hong Kong (to take the classic example of globalization studies); a Chicago Bulls T-shirt worn on the streets of Fez or Dakar; a cybercafé in Tehran; the Hollywood “look” in a Moroccan ﬁlm; a doughnut in Cairo or a muIn in Paris—is taken as a sign that globalization equals Americanization and vice versa. These ﬁgures of “America abroad,” now detached from those generations of “Americans abroad” as commodities and the forms that are associated with them (looks, types, and so forth), move with rapidity and abstraction across multiple national boundaries. But this very abstraction—the key component in precisely what aspects of American culture circulate globally—demonstrates the potential of disentangling America as global culture from America as exceptional empire. Here we signal the danger of replacing American selfmisrecognition with the other’s misrecognition of America as mediated through global mass culture. Just as the image of America abroad through the global circulation of images from media might be misidentiﬁed as the America encountered at home, the fear here is not so much that Baywatch will be misidentiﬁed as Virgin Land but rather that commercial America, which is really no longer America, will be misidentiﬁed as what remains resolutely the liberal multicultural America.32 One ought not to mistake America abroad as simply American popular culture, which in some ways is no longer its own anyway. At the other end of the popular-intellectual culture spectrum, America abroad includes a wide range of American studies centers, sometimes partially or wholly funded by the U.S. state itself, but increasingly fully funded by foreign states or entities. The explicit study of America abroad, however, is not limited to the academy; nor is all of this America culled from popular culture. Scholars, intellectuals, politicians, and business entrepreneurs across the world study U.S. political systems, business models, legal systems, and the rest. (See Brian Edwards’s discussion, in chapter 11, of the Osmania University College of Commerce and Business Management and its interest in American studies.) This trend also gives us a clue as to what we mean by “multilateral.” It is inconceivable to study bilateral mutual representations of Japan and the United States, China and the United States, as once was proposed by proponents of the interculturalist approach (inﬂuenced by the bilateral model of cultural exchange). What we need to understand now is the way in which some pivotal sites (although it is not easy to settle on which those would be), or geopolitically critical adversar-\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 29\n\nial sites (for example, Tehran), focus a detached regard back on America “global.” Nor is it settled that history and literature will be the privileged sites for engagement emerging from those sites. One of the consequences of multilateralism is that, unlike the American studies vernacular tradition, the global thrust is toward horizontality rather than verticality, or spatiality rather than temporality, although with a disconnect unlike that to which the “hemispheric” model was too beholden. In other words, the multilateral perspective of those who regard the United States from without tends to see the United States horizontally in terms of its place and its interests in the world rather than vertically as an agent constituted and galvanized by a distinct set of historically sedimented institutions and ideologies. None of these perspectives maintains a singular or binary gaze but rather a regional and ultimately multilateral perspective back on America. (It could be, paradoxically, that the American studies centers that Edwards visits tend to be the least multilateral in their regard of American culture, and that they tend toward a more binaristic comparison of American culture and history with their own.) In the vernacular strand of American studies, unity has been ontologized and historically located, as if unity was always and already a destiny of diJerence. In many ways, that kind of centrifugal metaphor—becoming one of many—has been overwhelmed by the global or “postnational” moment. Yet no national imaginary resists this movement as much as the American, which is less a reinvocation of American exceptionalism than a suggestion of how much Americans feel they stand to lose by acknowledging the postnational or multilateral conﬁguration. America resists this movement by attempting to replicate around the world, whether through commerce, culture, or geopolitics, its own fantasy of a dialogic nation, of a democratic culture that simultaneously entertains and masters discordant and dissonant voices. To invite everyone to subscribe to the dialectic of one among (and out of ) the many, the way America has, and to resist acknowledging alternative cultures of democracy and plurality such as the Indian and Iranian forms of democratic self-governance are potent examples. This is done, this message propagated, without recognition that the American way of being one among many, marking and eJacing diJerence, has undergone a radical transformation. We hang on to it only by an excessively ontologized ideological projection of a form, a method divorced from ethical substance. The United States as it engages the world does not always do so as a dialogic partner, even as a dominant dialogic partner. In this mode, American studies and “the United States” may be less distinguishable than elsewhere, which is evident from the way the Bush administration con-\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 30\n\nducted itself, of course. Still, the benign face of the Obama administration as a dialogic partner could commit precisely the error of binarism, which we referred to in the previous section. As pointed out earlier, however, America abroad does not present itself as a speaking subject but as the agent of capitalist modernity, continuously distancing itself from the traditional ideals and values (and even illusions) of the foundational principles of the nation. What is noteworthy today is that the American presence in “developing” countries is not marked so much by its role as a democratic teacher or a Socratic midwife of modernity, nor even primarily as a hegemonic military power, but rather as a commercial/economic/ﬁnancial force—both as successful model and, more recently and at the time of this writing, as a pitiful ﬁnancial giant addicted to consumption and indebted to everyone. As a capitalist agent, America has saturated the globe with a variety of artifacts, attitudes, styles, forms, and modes of being in the world, which may or may not represent “the American soul.” That is America abroad, which now casts a formidable shadow over both the vernacular and the cosmopolitan tradition, over both the American Adams at home and American innocents abroad. This shadow makes the diasporic imaginary impossible for both the American-born and those who would be Americans. In every respect, be it object domain, method, or theory itself, let alone politics, America abroad appears to be incomprehensible. The intellectual sensibility that would have to mark American studies in what purports to be a moderately long transitional phase is a ﬁnal version of what we’ve called the “transnational” moment or strand within the cosmopolitan tradition. Core methodological practices and the selecting and reading of objects within the vernacular tradition will continue as they always have, unperturbed perhaps. The peripheral topics within the vernacular tradition, however, particularly those such as diaspora studies, would have great diIculty making sense within the vernacular tradition except as an arrival within the vernacular center or as a negotiation between two places: “home” and the “new home.” The challenge of the transnational, which is destined to emancipate the diasporic from the spell of the vernacular and in the process reposition the cosmopolitan, is something that can no longer be deferred. That emancipatory work, however, has to be carried out by those who have caught the archive fever, the debilitating pandemic of the post–American Century.\n\nd i s fi guri n g the arch ive We are not advocating that those who work under a globally conscious “American studies” focus their attention solely on the transnational ﬁg-\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 31\n\nure, the scene of multinational ﬁnance capital, or the traveling ﬁgure per se. Rather, we are trying to derive from this ﬁgure and the experience of nonreturn (America as node) a sense of the fragmentary aspects of America, and from that sense a method or a call for an approach to the study of “America” in its many fragmentary guises. The experience of America abroad, be it for a native-born American or a diasporic American or for the rest, is necessarily fragmentary. At least here, the object preﬁgures the subject. The subject, as if by sheer act of the will, can no longer reappropriate and reconﬁgure America. It deﬁes full comprehension, easy totalization; its inﬂationary archive, no longer bridled by the print-mediated canon, swerves and deﬂects. America is not exactly a ﬂoating signiﬁer, although one is tempted to think of it in these terms (as Baudrillard does in Amérique and his other works that address the American fragment). America is a kind of material trace, an emanation. America’s presence is felt through a series of interventions—military and diplomatic, in culture and commerce, science and technology, ideas and ideologies—which leave these traces. So, for example, in Brian Larkin’s contribution to this collection, we detect the traces of a now dormant debate sparked elsewhere—in British colonial India—by an American cultural/commercial form (Hollywood cinema), ostensibly outside the legibility of the vernacular Americanist tradition. How dormant is that debate? How much more illegible and misrecognized is that debate among the putative Americanists when it is refashioned as Jihad vs. McWorld or as the Clash of Civilizations? The British colonial anxieties about representing the vulnerabilities of everyday “whiteness” before the native/colonial eyes are today allegedly replaced by the anxieties of the native, turned fundamentalist, about succumbing to the seductions of the multimediated everyday “whiteness” of television programs, from Dallas and Baywatch to Beverly Hills 90210 and Sex and the City. Similar quandaries and situations are described and analyzed in Naoki Sakai’s and Elizabeth Thompson’s contributions to this collection; they are all perhaps mutually illegible but more powerful in their juxtaposition. What do these case studies signal in terms of a research protocol, or a method by which to reimagine “American studies” itself? In some ways, the contributions collected here are a partial answer to this question, although we have learned from them and they did not proceed from these considerations but rather have been operating in their own spheres of interest, disciplinary and extradisciplinary frames. The scholars in this volume provide alternative models of inquiry and interpretation for the next generation of transnational cultural studies work and are developing new paradigms about the circulation of public forms which are pushing the boundaries of ﬁelds such as media studies,\n\nbrian t. edwards & dilip parameshwar gaonkar • 32\n\nAfrican American studies, gender studies, and American history. In multiple ways they address questions of globalization, global culture and diaspora, alternative modernities, and cosmopolitan forms and are not constrained by the paradigms in the various ﬁelds in which they were trained or within which they work. The contributors include faculty from departments of English, history, anthropology, Asian studies, comparative literature, women’s studies, rhetoric, and American studies; all also have multiple aIliations with a diverse range of departments, such as African studies, Middle East studies, Latin American studies, African American studies, Asian American studies, gender studies, and media studies. This group is not one whose members would ordinarily ﬁnd themselves classiﬁed together; it is, however, a group of scholars who are exceptionally dynamic in their scholarship and their mode of scholarly presentation. The essays included in this volume, except for those by Kariann Yokota, Donald Pease, and Claudio Lomnitz, refer wholly to events of the twentieth century, the period of time during which the tripartite structure of American studies, American Century, and the exceptionalist thesis was coming to the fore. Even in the period of that emergence and consolidation one can detect the destabilizing presence of multilateralism. To begin with, in the late eighteenth century, the British Empire had set in place complex circuits of exchange of goods, people, ideas, and ideologies, of which colonial America and the newly independent America were a part. Kariann Akemi Yokota’s account of a newly independent but intellectually insecure America trying to acquire cultural capital in Scotland demonstrates a multilateral strategy on the part of individual, elite Americans—one matched by the methodological strategy of the cosmopolitan scholar herself. What is distinctive about Yokota’s essay, “Bodies of Knowledge,” is its concern with the movement of people—more precisely, the mobility of individuals in the world of medicine and those who aspired to enter this world during the colonial and early republic period. Characterized as bearers of scientiﬁc knowledge, these elites enter and try to negotiate a transatlantic matrix marked by what Yokota calls the geography of value. The putatively neocolonial relationship with Britain turns out not to be a relationship with Britain primarily but rather with Scotland. The operation of this geography of value cannot be grasped in any bilateral sense. The perceived superiority of Scotland’s scientiﬁc knowledge versus that of the subordinate United States shows American science in need of supplementation. In fact, as Yokota shows us, supplementarity was already in play in the relation of England and Scotland, with the latter deemed inferior and peripheral to the British imperial center. In Yokota’s essay, the human body and mind are the privileged bearers of national identity.\n\nIntroduction: Globalizing American Studies • 33\n\nExchange between the United States and Scot"
