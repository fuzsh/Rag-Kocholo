        "text": "Website: https://calhoun.faculty.asu.edu/\n\nCraig Calhoun is University Professor of Social Sciences at Arizona State University.\n\nPrior to joining ASU, Calhoun served as director and president of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and president of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC). Calhoun has served on the faculty of New York University (NYU), Columbia University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). While at NYU, he served as founder and director of the Institute for Public Knowledge. At UNC he held positions as dean of the Graduate School and director of the University Center for International Studies. He has also served as visiting professor at numerous institutions in the U.S. and abroad, including Princeton, the Technical University of Munich, Humboldt University (Berlin), and the University of Oslo.\n\nCalhoun’s work at ASU focuses on strengthening the ability of the social sciences, working together with the natural sciences, engineering and humanities, to address the most complex challenges facing society today—from crises in democracy to the shifting nature of globalization and the future of place-based communities, the complicated social and ethical issues raised by new technologies, and the need for creativity, solidarity, and determination in order to achieve just and sustainable futures.\n\nHe is the author or coauthor of 9 books, editor of another 22, and has published more than 70 journal articles and 100 book chapters that address culture, social movements, education, communication, religion, nationalism, the impact of technology, capitalism and globalization, critical theory and philosophy, and contemporary and historical empirical research. His work has been widely reprinted in anthologies and translated into 21 languages.\n\nCalhoun serves on the board of the Mastercard Foundation and co-chairs the board of the American Assembly. He has been elected a fellow of the British Academy, the American Association for Advancement of Science, and the American Philosophical Society, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an Einstein Fellow by the City of Berlin, and president of the International Institute of Sociology. He has also served as president of the Berggruen Institute and holds honorary appointments as Centennial Professor at LSE and professor at the College d’Etudes Mondiales of the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme in Paris.\n\nCalhoun received his D.Phil. from Oxford University, combining politics, sociology, and history.
