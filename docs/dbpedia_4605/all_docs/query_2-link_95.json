        "text": "It’s not that I like to be cruel, or to love the darkness. It’s a strange addiction I have with love, and war and the things that our hearts find as extremes. The extremes of American life today where everything is at the touch of a finger on a piece of metal and glass, the iPhone and love and war. Games we play, swiping right and left. Like it’s a solution to our age old problem of love and war. I mean love is madness, as war is madness. Love and war are really not all that different, I mean one is micro and one is micro. The same. The same struggle over ideals, or what is right. I mean to share a bed is to trust your enemy, the other sex. The one you don’t know, or understand. I swiped right on MuzMatch and got here, some strange new Muslim only dating app. God, what is this thing we’ve done giving Muslims access to Tinder, what a recipe for disaster. What a mistake, to mix two cultures that don’t understand each other. This mess, this hot mess is not really that surprising or unheard of. I struggle with identity and face in this country who wishes to deport and wall. I get neck deep into a situation, read her my Grady Hospital records with hopes of an understanding of this thing we call bipolar disorder. This thing we call in this country manic depression, with little bit of PTSD on the side from all the police and psychiatric commitments, and all the drugs. All the pills, as they say:\n\n“All the advantages of Christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.”\n\n…there is always soma, delicious soma, half a gramme for a half-holiday, a gramme for a week-end, two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous East, three for a dark eternity on the moon…\n\n…Benito was notoriously good-natured. People said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma. The malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. Reality for Benito was always sunny.”\n\nBrave New World, Aldous Huxley\n\nYup, so where are mine, I cannot afford them. Traveling from state to state lost in an activist haze. Trying to save a world that should not be saved, alive but not fully rational. This strange mix of madness and sanity, I mean I avoided the conflict today at home by working a full day and returning to the keyboard at night outside a coffee shop open 24 hours for people like me. I am of the devil she said, perhaps but what if this struggle is beyond her scope. Do they know about American psychiatry in Iraq? Probably not, and for that reason it’s best to stay away. What a mistake to marry into this mess. I wish I had not, but at least I am alive and awake to write and struggle back to a sense of sanity and balance after years homeless and on the road. After years of struggle and loss, after burning every trace of past to the ground what is left but to walk forward. To where I don’t know, this may sound like quite a ramble, and it is. However, I am coming around and wishing that I could do better. How does one teach another to step back and listen in the face of doubt and pain, and realize that love is slow like a graceful river now for me. I don’t want a rollercoaster or a raging river, or class V rapids. I’ve done all that before, several times and I am tired, exhausted in fact from the very fact that I’ve made it here alive to struggle one more day. One more fight, they say in the Guardian:\n\n“Bruni’s taps deliver poison to its poor, largely Hispanic residents but other rural towns in the state suffer with water that is black, brown or stinks of rotten eggs…\n\nJulio Perez sprayed his yard with water from a garden hose. While the flowers were no doubt grateful for the refreshment on a warm afternoon, there was no chance of him quenching his own thirst with a gulp of tap water.\n\nThe 66-year-old lives in Bruni, a tiny Texas town notable for a very unwelcome reason: the quantity of arsenic in its water. In 2014-15 the average concentration of the carcinogen was 79.6 parts per billion: almost eight times the federal limit.\n\nThis was a mild improvement on the long-term average of 85.3 ppb since 2002, but Bruni was the runaway leader at the top of the Texas arsenic standings in a report compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project. The next-worst rate was 56.2 ppb in a district serving the 5,000-strong ranching community of Hebbronville, 13 miles from Bruni.\n\nUsing data from the state agency, the Texas commission on environmental quality (TCEQ), the report identified 65 Texas community water systems, serving over 82,000 people, which over the past two years have exceeded the arsenic standard set by the Safe Drinking Water Act. It found that some 51,000 of them in 34 communities have been exposed to drinking water with excessive levels of arsenic for at least a decade.\n\nThis is not news to the residents of Bruni, a poor, mostly Hispanic place 45 miles east of the border with Mexico. “Most of the people don’t drink the water any more,” said Perez, who has lived there for more than 25 years. “It looks cloudy,” said a woman in town who declined to give her name. “We don’t drink it,” said another.\n\nThe borderlands are replete with small, underresourced towns like Bruni where many residents have given up on using the water.”\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/texas-water-quality-arsenic-levels\n\nWell, I am here mind as well be of service. I should not get to close and look for love, I mean this is business. Never fall in love with your charity cases, you don’t understand their culture or their ways. It’s more science and exploration and the journey into the unknown for me than anything else at this point. This strange on the road life, living like Kerouac, is not seems to be. I never read the book, I was forced here. I could not afford my soma. So be it, let’s live out the war, and forget the peace. This is a war, a war on the poor waged by me driving around too much. A life afraid of connection, of silence and of peace.\n\nLove Letter to a Millennial Girl\n\nMy love, I know, I’ve seen it too,\n\nIt’s not like you are any one in particular,\n\nOr, small or fat, skinny, or tall, or white or black,\n\nI’ll tell you a secret, a quiet one that you learn in time,\n\nPaint in the face of doubt, lift your body out of the chair,\n\nWalk outside my love, don’t be afraid to run away,\n\nWalk, walk with the winds of time,\n\n…escape for a moment and go to the waters,\n\nGet a couple used bottles and get the water,\n\nGo home, boil it down, and go to Blick’s Arts Supply,\n\nBuy a canvas, and do an enso, just pour the water down in that canvas,\n\nLet it dry, stare at it, come back, that’s your mind,\n\nYour mind is earth and water, it’s her is it aways has been,\n\nTake a walk with me in five dimensions, not that I am there,\n\nI never am really anywhere, drifting here or there,\n\nWhere are you my wife, my love I was there long ago,\n\nIn a small hut by the sacred water of Coast Guard Beach,\n\nI walked with a stick and played in the sand,\n\nCome on out to the sacred water, my love you can see it now,\n\nIn ways that you once could not, toiling away at a cotton mill or in a call center,\n\nI tried all that and it broke, Mind, the deep secret is that it’s water,\n\nIt always ways, I saw you at first sight and could read the pain,\n\nThe way you never looked me in the eye,\n\nI wanted to blow you apart and put you back together,\n\nThose I love I don’t leave untouched, the omega point is not that far off,\n\nWe’re almost there, total unity, Facebook says unite the world, make it smaller,\n\nYou swipe right for love, my love, let me give you a secret,\n\nLovers write with pens and paper, they dictate to secretaries,\n\n…or hid long enough waiting for the moment to explode with yearning,\n\nWhere are you, why have you not been here before,\n\nYour generation, is full of children men, and sage women, healers, dancers, shamans,\n\nArtists, not hippies, cyberpunks and torn jeans, black boots, and share snaps of wit,\n\nNot that you have much choice, I could not see it today, in my life,\n\nWe looked for the hole in the wall, the fly in the ointment,\n\nYou, see the sun for the light it is, yearning for the age of Aquarius,\n\nBut you know, I thought that was gone long ago,\n\nOn your arms, you wear a badge of similarity, of Minnesota Nice,\n\nThe thing I like about New York and Boston is they just go ahead and run you over,\n\nJust get it over with already, they said,\n\n“At Harvard the knife you in the back, at MIT they knife you in the chest,”\n\nSo true, glad I like it that way now, I’d like you to dance over your walls,\n\nLearn to scream and run naked in the snow with me, with your sisters,\n\nMadness is a human right now, in this age, we are all allowed,\n\nLet it be the norm, so we can all understand we’re all together,\n\nIt’s not that I know what to say when I see you in pain, my love let me write you a letter,\n\nA love letter by hand, I know that sounds so strange, to profess love to a digital phantom,\n\nTha phantom sees it as the norm, I’ve never really known home in earth,\n\nOr see peace, in a time, here or there, for these reasons, I am there with you,\n\nI skipped a generation, a generation is all we have now, to decide,\n\nIt was put there for you to determine, for that reason forget it,\n\nWalk away, it’s not your problem, go to the water and pray,\n\nThese are the times we are in, to accept fate and bow and relax,\n\nForward we go and I know anything that is slow is good,\n\nSlow food, walking, shoveling snow, animals in the woods,\n\nGoats that eat poetry, cats that drink poison water, they are here to accept it,\n\nThey will come back, don’t worry, we will create space soon,\n\nLet me hold you in prayer, I don’t know what else to do,\n\nI am scared too, these are the time we face, be it as they may,\n\nBut know that you have done something extra ordinary today,\n\nSomething I know, and want to heal, I dream and pray,\n\nEach day, for your healing, what else to do but write and paint in the face of doubt,\n\nMy tears run as the rivers, to wash away those things that hinder you from crying,\n\nSee a man cry, a grown man cry, it’s possible, I did it yesterday,\n\nLet me tear stain a love letter to you, whereever you are.\n\nSent with ProtonMail Secure Email."
