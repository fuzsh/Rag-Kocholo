        "text": "Anti-modernism is a term that historians and literary critics have employed in different ways: to refer to the rejection of an “overcivilized” modernity and to describe the popular literary forms that are understood to be the antithesis of literary modernism. The author argues that both understandings of the term offer helpful frameworks for a materialist reading of Graphic Publishers––an Ottawa-based\n\nThis chapter discusses the emergence of Greek-Cypriot modernity, with regard to wider socio-political and cultural changes on the island of Cyprus at the turn of the twentieth century. We identify three main forces: (a) British colonialism, (b) Greek nationalism, and (c) an organized Left and labor movement, in relation to relevant changes in the visual arts through a detailed examination of the work of Ioannis Kissonergis (1889–1963), Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994), Costas Stathis (1913–1987), and Loukia Nicolaidou (1909–1993). We also make reference to vernacular photography and wider culture to further support our tracing of Greek-Cypriot modernity in the visual arts and its relationship to the established orthodox narratives of European modernity. We finally argue that these influences have led to the emergence of an alternative modernity in Cyprus that is site-specific, and which allows us to reconsider and challenge conventional understandings of European modernity as singular and homogeneous.\n\nThis essay examines three museums of contemporary art in Lima, Peru: MAC (Museum of Contemporary Art), MALI (Lima Art Museum), and MASM (San Marcos Art Museum). As framed through curatorial studies and cultural politics, we argue that the curatorial practices of these institutions are embedded with tensions linked to the negotiation of regional, national, and international identities, coloniality, and alternate modernities between Western paradigms of contemporary art and contemporary vernacular art in Peru. Peruvian national institutions have not engaged in the collection of contemporary art, leaving these practices to private entities such as the MAC, MALI, and MASM. However, these three institutions have not, until recently, actively collected contemporary vernacular Peruvian art and its by-products, thus inscribing this work as “non-Western” through curatorial practices and creating competing conceptions of the contemporary. The curatorial practices of the MAC, MALI, and MASM reflect the complex and contested musealities and conceptions of the contemporary that co-exist in Lima. This essay will address this environment and the emergence of alternative forms of museality, curatorial practices, and indigenous artist’s strategies that continually construct and disrupt different modernities and create spaces for questioning constructs of contemporary art and Peruvian cultural identities.\n\nTracing recent scholarly trends in the intersecting fields of Theatre and Performance Studies, Comparative Studies, and Modernist Studies, this essay proposes a comparative and historicist model for thinking about the development of modernism as a global process. Because modernism is both thematically and formally about experiential and conceptual processes of change, it proposes performance as a way of mapping new heuristics of knowledge and forms of representation across cultures _as_ an unfolding process of change.\n\n\"Planetary Modernisms: Why the Contemporary Needs the Longue Duree\" is a keynote address for a conference on Oceanic Modernism, University of South Pacific, Fiji, February 3-5, 2016. Argues that transnationalizing modernist studies requires a major paradigm shift on the concept of \"modernity\" in order to avoid isolating island studies on the periphery. The paper review some key arguments of Planetary Modernisms: Provocations on Modernity Across Time (Columbia UP, 2015) in relation to new theories of archipelagic epistemology and current issues in island/archipelagic studies."
