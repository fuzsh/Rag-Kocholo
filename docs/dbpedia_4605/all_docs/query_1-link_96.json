        "text": "Convener: Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar\n\nWhat is the nature of our present conjuncture? With what contradictions is it wrought? What possibilities does it open?\n\nThese questions were long the core of the humanities and social sciences, but over the last half century, their centrality has waned. Driven by a quest for precision, Braudelâs histoire de la longue durÃ©e gave way to lâhistoire Ã©vÃ©nementielle and even la microhistoire and, among more quantitative studies, narrower topics became increasingly dominant. As scholars across the humanities and social sciences turned their attention to more immediate concerns with discrete texts and narratives, the analysis of big framing concepts like modernity or global capitalism receded. Engagement with the big themes never vanished, but they are back at the center of attention. We live in an unsettled era and a present moment rife with transnational transformations and global challenges. New technologies call our attention to upheavals in capitalism and indeed in our understanding of the human itself. Shifiting political paradigms reflect increasing disorder within different polities and suggest that we might be on the verge of a reconstitution of the modern world-system. Building on the Centerâs previous engagements, especially with âalternative modernities,â this forum seeks to explore not just what is going on now, but the significance of ânowâ in macro-historical and global contexts.\n\nThe Center for Transcultural Studies, in collaboration with the Center for Global Culture and Communication (CGCC) at Northwestern University, is launching an online forum titled Questioning the Present. Every two months, we will congregate via a video conferencing service to address these questions and problems.\n\nThis is a hybrid forum, fostering dialogue among CTS members at the same time we invite the public to participate, via the co-sponsorship of the CGCC."
