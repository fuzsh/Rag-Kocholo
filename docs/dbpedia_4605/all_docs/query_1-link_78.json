This seal, approved on June 26, 1856, consisted of an open book surrounded by rays of light and circled by the words Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. Thirty years later Daniel Bonbright, professor of Latin and a member of Northwestern's original faculty, redesigned the seal, retaining the book and light rays and adding two quotations. On the pages of the open book he placed a Greek quotation from the Gospel of John, chapter 1, verse 14, translating to The Word . . .full of grace and truth. Circling the book are the first three words, in Latin, of the University motto: Quaecumque sunt vera (Whatsoever things are true). The outer border of the seal carries the name of the University and the date of its founding. This seal, which remains Northwestern's official signature, was approved by the Board of Trustees on December 5, 1890. The full text of the University motto, adopted on June 17, 1890, is from the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians, chapter 4, verse 8 (King James Version). NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY 'M^hatsoever things are truCy whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there he any virtue, and if there he any praise, think on these things. 2 Commencement *The appearance of a candidate's name is presumptive evidence of graduation but is not to be regarded as conclusive.

Johnson 8 History of Northwestern The founding of Northwestern University by nine devout Methodists embodied a mixture of religious conviction and secular optimism that is uniquely American. Meeting above a hardware store in the burgeoning frontier town of Chicago, these nine men resolved on May 31, 1850, to establish an institution of \"the highest order of excellence\" to serve the people of the original Northwest Territory as established by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota). The 1851 Act of Incorporation creating Northwestern University contained a provision reflecting the strong religious beliefs of its founders but requiring no particular religious faith of students or members of the faculty. Only one of the founders, physician John Evans, was a college graduate. The quintessential renaissance man, he built railroads, founded both the Illinois Medical Society and the Illinois Republican Party, and was a confidant of Abraham Lincoln, who appointed him governor of the Colorado Territory. Evans guided Northwestern during its critical early years, chairing the Board of Trustees from the time of the University's founding in 1851 until his death in 1897. The town that grew up around Northwestern was named Evanston in his honor. Northwestern grew and prospered under Evans's stewardship. In 1853 the University bought and began to develop 379 acres of lakeshore farmland. By 1855 the University had completed its first building and opened a College of Liberal Arts with two faculty members and ten male students. By 1869 Northwestern had admitted its first female students; four years later, it negotiated a merger with the Evanston College for Ladies, whose president, eminent suffragette and temperance movement leader Frances E. Willard, became Northwestern's first dean of women. By 1900 Northwestern consisted of not only a liberal arts college but also six under- graduate and graduate professional schools, including the schools of law and medicine in Chicago. With the establishment of the Graduate School in 1910, Northwestern adopted the German university model of providing graduate as well as undergraduate instruction, emphasizing research along with teaching. The University's development since then has paralleled the growth of metropolitan Chicago. Today Northwestern is a private research university of distinction, with 11 academic divisions located on two lakefront campuses in Evanston and Chicago; Northwestern University in Qatar opened in Doha in 2008. The University has approximately 3,100 full-time faculty, 16,000 full-time students, and an annual budget of more than $1.9 billion. Northwestern's vision of excellence — although faithful to its founding — invigorates a territory far beyond the old Northwest Territory through the accomplishments of its alumni and by virtue of a distinguished faculty and high- achieving student body drawn from across the nation and around the world. 9 Schools of the University Thejudd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, established in 1851 as the College of Liberal Arts, offers the degree of bachelor of arts.

Each school group is preceded by its banner. The formation within each school begins with those graduates receiving the highest degree awarded by that school; doctoral candidates are followed by masters candidates, who in turn are followed by bachelors candidates. Following the graduates are the University faculty, trustees, administrators, and deans. The president's party, led by the senior class Commencement committee, completes the procession. ACADEMIC DRESS Modern academic attire originated in the medieval universities of Europe, where gowns were worn daily to provide warmth in poorly heated buildings and to differentiate scholars from other citizens. Two English universities, Oxford and Cambridge, are particularly noted for developing the authentic academic costume, which has changed only slightly through the centuries. In the United States most academic dress follows the general provisions of the Intercollegiate Code of 1895, which was revised in 1932 and again in 1959. Under this code the gowns' trim and sleeve design indicates the level of the degree. The bachelor's gown has pointed sleeves and is worn closed; the master's gown has oblong sleeves with an arc at the bottom and may be worn open or closed; and the doctor's gown, which may also be worn open or closed, has velvet facings down the front and three velvet bars on the bell-shaped sleeves. This velvet trim may be black or the prescribed color of the academic area. Though the recommended color for gowns is black. Northwestern University (like many institutions) has adopted a colored gown to reflect the school's color. All participating candidates wear a custom purple gown featuring the University crest. Graduates of foreign universities wear gowns of various colors. The style of hood identifies the level of the degree, the school that granted it, and the academic area. Hood length and border width show the level of the degree. The bachelor's hood, which is optional and not worn at Northwestern University, is three feet in length; the master's, three and one- half feet; the doctor's, four feet. The velvet border of the hood is two, three, and five inches wide for the bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees, respectively. The hood is lined with silk in the official color of the school. At Northwestern the hood is lined in purple (the school's color) and gold. The color of the hood's border — and at Northwestern the color of the cap's tassel as well — indicates the academic area. Tassels feature the Northwestern seal signet and are worn on the left side at all times. At Northwestern the colors for the Graduate School constitute an exception; tassels are black, but the border color of the hood indicates the specific degree awarded. Bachelor's degree regalia include a souvenir stole. The square black mortarboard is the recommended cap, although some schools have adopted other styles. Caps are worn throughout the Commencement ceremony, except that men remove them for the national anthem, invocation, and benediction. At Northwestern University members of honor societies may be recognized by the honor cords, medallions, and stoles worn. The tassels and borders of the hoods are the following colors: Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences White School of Communication Silver gray School of Continuing Studies Master of Arts White Master of Science Yellow gold School of Education and Social Policy Light blue Robert R.

He received his BS in chemical engineering from the University of Arkansas, completed the executive program at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, and achieved National Board Certification in 2010. Christopher Esposito, a social studies teacher from South High School in Downers Grove, Illinois, graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001. In the 12 years since he began teaching social studies, Esposito has earned a master's degree in educational administration from Northern Illinois University and a PhD in curriculum studies from the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 2011 he was named South High School's social studies department chair. He was nominated by senior Laura Ledvora of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Kelly O'Keefe-Boettcher is an American authors and International Baccalaureate English teacher from Rufus King High School in Milwaukee. According to her nominator, senior Jessica Holden of the School of Education and Social Policy, O'Keefe-Boettcher can make a teenager feel like her classroom is the best place to be every day for 52 minutes as she challenges students to read and write critically while showing a caring and respectful attitude toward everyone she encounters throughout her day. O'Keefe-Boettcher received her BA and MA degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and her teaching certification from Alverno College. David Quinn is a teacher of English and the theory of knowledge at Edmonds- Woodway High School in Edmonds, Washington. He was nominated by McCormick senior Taiyo Sogawa, who credits Quinn with teaching him to think critically, a skill he applies to his work in computer engineering. Quinn takes a student-centered approach to teaching and served as a mentor for Sogawa in and out of the classroom. As the coordinator of the International Baccalaureate program, Quinn has increased full-IB diploma registration by 100 percent since 2011. Before becoming a teacher, Quinn was an actor whose credits included appearing in national commercials and as a child actor on Sesame Street, hosting the Primetime Emmy-nominated science series 3-2-1 Contact, and winning a Peabody Award as host of that series' Ryan White program, \"I Have AIDS — A Teenager's Story.\" While teaching, Quinn cofounded Allrecipes. com, now the world's number-one food website, and served as its chair until 2006. Julianne Schrick is a National Board- certified mathematics teacher with more than 25 years of experience. She has been teaching at Redwood High School in Larkspur, California, since 1995. Her teaching philosophy is based on instilling in students — regardless of their backgrounds or aptitudes — a belief that they can take on hard challenges and succeed. This belief is exemplified in the four seniors who collaborated on her nomination: Danielle Littman and Rachel Abrahams of the School of Communication and Jonathan Kaplan and Daniel Kaplan of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Over the last six years, more than 80 percent of Schrick's AP Calculus BC students have received a score of 5. She received her BA in mathematics and MS in education from Dominican College of San Rafael. 15 Undergraduate Degrees JUDD A.
