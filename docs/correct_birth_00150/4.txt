Tell me something about her art!

In 1964, Yoko Ono published a book of instructions called ‘Grapefruit’... yes, like the fruit!

Some of the instructions are short, just one word long, and others have many parts inviting you to make, move and imagine. If you follow these instructions, on your own or with others, you are invited to take part in artworks. You can fold paper and read. You can dance with chairs. You can make a wish. You can sweep, breathe and whisper – together, alone or even in your mind!
