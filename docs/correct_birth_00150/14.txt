Bio:

Yoko Ono (born in Tokyo, Japan on February 18, 1933) is a Japanese multimedia artist, singer, songwriter, and peace activist who is also known for her work in performance art, music, and filmmaking. Yoko grew up in Tokyo, but she moved to New York to be with her family in 1953. She attended college at Sarah Lawrence College but never graduated because she became involved in New York City’s downtown artist scene and eloped with her first husband. Yoko, who is the well-known wife of John Lennon, first met John in 1966 at her own art exhibition in London. They became a couple in 1968. The two famously used their honeymoon in Amsterdam as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War. Yoko brought feminism to the forefront of society by using her music as a vessel. She ended up influencing the B-52s and Meredith Monk. In 1980 Yoko achieved commercial and critical acclaim with her chart-topping album Double Fantasy, which was released three weeks before John’s death. As his widow, Yoko has worked to preserve his legacy. She funded Strawberry Fields in New York City and Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland. She has also made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, peace, the Philippine and Japan disaster relief, and other causes. In 2012, she co-founded the Artists Against Fracking group.
