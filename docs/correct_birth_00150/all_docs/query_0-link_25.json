        "text": "Yoko Ono - Click on picture for source\n\nAbout Me:\n\nMultimedia artist and performer Yoko Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in Tokyo, Japan, the eldest of three children born to Eisuke and Isoko, a wealthy aristocratic family. At the age of 18 she moved in with her parents in Scarsdale, New York. Settling in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, Ono developed an interest in art and began writing poetry. Considered too radical by many, her work was not well-received, but she gained recognition after working with American jazz musician/film producer Anthony Cox, who later became her second husband. Cox financed and helped coordinate her \"interactive conceptual events\" in the early 1960s.\n\nYoko was also married to John Lennon from the Beatles.\n\n- Biography.com"
