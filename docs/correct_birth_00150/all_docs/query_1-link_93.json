        "text": "Yoko Ono have several desirable qualities. First and foremost, Yoko Ono revel in work and there is hardly a limit to the amount of work Yoko Ono can do. Next, Yoko Ono have Yoko Ono's eyes wide open and Yoko Ono's brain is alert. Taken together, these qualities single Yoko Ono out as being a very powerful influence in Yoko Ono's own sphere of activities.Yoko Ono are wonderfully practical in all Yoko Ono do, and Yoko Ono have a very keen brain for remembering details. In fact, details mean so much to Yoko Ono that Yoko Ono are apt to irritate some of Yoko Ono's co-workers with them. Yoko Ono never forget a face, though Yoko Ono are less accurate in remembering names.Yoko Ono are a person who wants to know the why and where of everything. Until Yoko Ono are satisfied on these points, Yoko Ono refrain from acting. Consequently, sometimes Yoko Ono miss a good deal, and some people look upon Yoko Ono as a procrastinator.In a measure Yoko Ono are too sensitive and often Yoko Ono hold back when Yoko Ono should go ahead. This unfits Yoko Ono for certain forms of leadership. Yoko Ono do not want Yoko Ono's own way in many things. In fact, Yoko Ono are very amenable, taken all round.\n\nYoko Ono are a practical person. Yoko Ono have the ability to systematically organise Yoko Ono's life, sober-mindedly realising that Yoko Ono must work for success. Yoko Ono tend to be a loner, preferring to think and study, and excel at solving difficult problems. Sober and cautious, Yoko Ono can be completely fulfilled if Yoko Ono will view life with more optimism. Yoko Ono are usually happier in life when Yoko Ono come to the realisation that life is not as bad as Yoko Ono thought it be.Yoko Ono are quite practical, which is why Yoko Ono tend to assess any situation in this manner only. Yoko Ono have the necessary consciousness and eligibility to grasp knowledge. Yoko Ono develop interest in knowledge which has practical information to offer. Yoko Ono will be counted among the intelligent students and with the help of Yoko Ono's sharp intellect and logical reasoning abilities, Yoko Ono will pass difficult exams with flying colours. Yoko Ono will possess great wisdom from Yoko Ono's childhood and observe and learn from other human beings. Yoko Ono's memory power will be quite strong and Yoko Ono may distinctly remember each and every activity of Yoko Ono's past for a long time. This will also benefit Yoko Ono's studies and Yoko Ono will touch great heights educationally. But refrain Yoko Ono'sself from maintaining an overtly practical attitude."
