        "text": "Yoko Ono (b. 1933) has made profound contributions to visual art, performance, filmmaking, and experimental music since emerging onto the international art scene in the early 1960s. Born in Tokyo, she moved to New York in the mid-1950s and became a primary figure in the development of Fluxus and Conceptual art. Blurring the boundaries between art, politics, and society, her work promotes world peace through simple and direct messages on stamps, pins, billboards, banners, and posters.\n\nHours\n\nMonday - Tuesday: Closed\n\nWednesday - Sunday: 10 a.m. – 5 p.m.\n\nThursday: 10 a.m. – 8 p.m."
