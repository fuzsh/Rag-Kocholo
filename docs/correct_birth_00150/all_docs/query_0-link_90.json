        "text": "Yoko Ono born (Ono Yoko) February 18, 1933 Japanese artist and peace activist, known for her work in avant-garde art, music and filmmaking, as well as her 1969 to 1980 marriage to John Lennon. Dropping out of the graduate track program in philosophy at Tokyo's Peers School, Ono moved to New York in 1953 joining her immediate family who were already there. Quitting Sarah Lawrence College, she became involved in New York City's downtown artists scene, collaborating and working with members in and around the Fluxus group. An independent artist in her own right before meeting Lennon, both the media and the public were critical of her for years. She was repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music, and blamed for the breakup of the Beatles: The couple's early years coincided with the band's final ones.\n\nYoko Ono music records LIST\n\n1968 Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins (with John Lennon)\n\n1969 Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions (with John Lennon)\n\n1969 Wedding Album (with John Lennon)\n\n1969 Live Peace in Toronto 1969 (with John Lennon)\n\n1970 Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\n\n1971 Fly\n\n1972 Approximately Infinite Universe\n\n1972 Some Time in New York City (with John Lennon)\n\n1973 Feeling the Space\n\n1974 A Story\n\n1980 Double Fantasy (with John Lennon)\n\n1981 Season of Glass\n\n1982 It's Alright (I See Rainbows)\n\n1984 Milk and Honey (with John Lennon)\n\n1985 Starpeace\n\n1995 Rising\n\n2001 Blueprint for a Sunrise\n\n2007 Yes, I'm a Witch\n\n2007 Open Your Box\n\n2009 Between My Head and the Sky\n\n2012 Yokokimthurston\n\n2013 Take Me to the Land of Hell"
