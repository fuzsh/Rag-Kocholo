        "text": "Is there a more divisive and controversial person in Beatles history than Yoko Ono? Why was she always at John’s side? What did the others think of her? Did Yoko split up The Beatles? The Get Back series proved that she and John were almost inseparable, but many more people were in the studio!\n\nThere is always a lot of negative press, but now there is a new book by Madeline Bocaro called In Your Mind – The Infinite Universe of Yoko Ono. For a change, this is an objective look at Yoko and who the REAL Yoko Ono Lennon is, which will surprise you.\n\nOno’s fascinating life goes way beyond what most people know. We visit Yoko’s inner and outer worlds. You will be touched by her wit and wisdom, her spiritual nature, and her intent.\n\nAlthough always associated with John, her life story spans thirty-three years before meeting John Lennon, twelve years with him, and over forty years of creativity since his death. Yoko breaks down the boundaries between art and life. Her enchanting philosophy and uplifting positivity are irresistible. She shows us the truth – with sincerity and humor, enlightening us to our own superpowers.\n\nOno’s work is unfinished – to be completed in your mind.\n\nHer art is on the ceiling, on the floor, and in the sky. It is invisible – a wind, a whisper, a scream. It is imagining one thousand suns rising, a billion universes, stealing moonlight on the water… Ono’s music and films are an extension of her art. This book covers every aspect of her life and work.\n\nWill you be bold enough to read this book with an open mind and discover the REAL Yoko?"
