The experience of hammering away at the work is part of the art, making the viewer a part of the piece and fostering a collaborative effort between artist and viewer. \n\nJoin us in sending warm wishes to Yoko Ono on her birthday! \n\n—\n\nPortrait: @YokoOno official, New York, 1960\n\nYoko Ono, Painting to Hammer a Nail In, 1961-1998, Bronze With Patina, Painting: 11 1/2 x 8 3/4 x 4 1/4 in.
