        "text": "DOUBLE FANTASY – John & Yoko exhibition to be held in Tokyo\n\nSony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. is proud to announce that DOUBLE FANTASY – John & Yoko, the groundbreaking exhibition which tells the story of John Lennon (referred to as “John” hereunder) and Yoko Ono (referred to as “Yoko” hereunder) through their own words and works, will be held in Tokyo taking place from Friday, October 9, 2020, which would have marked John’s 80th birthday, through Monday, January 11, 2021 at the Sony Music Roppongi Museum.\n\nDOUBLE FANTASY – John & Yoko was first held in John’s hometown in England at the Museum of Liverpool from May 2018 through November 2019. Yoko felt strongly about telling her story in Liverpool, the place of John’s birth, and was deeply involved in the creation. The exhibition was highly acclaimed for its compelling approach and rarely seen exhibits and drew an unprecedented total of 700,000 visitors. It was even extended 7 months from the initial plan.\n\nThe exhibition will be held in Yoko’s hometown Tokyo this year, which marks both the 80th anniversary of John’s birth and the 40th anniversary of his untimely passing, and is expected to feature a total of more than 100 items of artworks, music and films created by John and Yoko alongside items from Yoko’s private collection.\n\nDOUBLE FANTASY – John & Yoko\n\nIn a world first, the exhibition illustrates the journey of the iconic couple chronologically through their words, quotes, music, artwork and personal belongings. It also celebrates the meeting of two extraordinary creative artists and explores their personal and creative chemistry and their ongoing Imagine Peace campaign.\n\nHighlights of the exhibition\n\nCeiling Painting\n\nYoko’s work shown at her Unfinished Paintings and Objects exhibition at the Indica Gallery in London in 1966 where John and Yoko first met.\n\nJohn’s handwritten lyrics\n\nHandwritten lyrics by John Lennon including ‘Imagine’, ‘In My Life’, ‘Give Peace a Chance’, ‘Happy Xmas (War is Over)’, ‘Woman’ etc.\n\nYoko’s book Grapefruit which she gave to John as a gift\n\nFirst published in 1964, Grapefruit is an artist book that represents a seminal piece of conceptual art and had direct influence on the lyrics and concept behind ‘Imagine’\n\nConceptual works the couple produced together\n\nInclude works such as WAR IS OVER! (if you want it), Plastic Ono Band, and their first collaboration Acorn Peace.\n\nWish Tree\n\nAn artwork in which visitors can participate by writing their wishes for the future on a piece of paper and tie it around a branch. After the exhibition, digital copies of all of the wishes will be kept in the heart of the IMAGINE PEACE TOWER in Iceland, an outdoor public artwork representing John and Yoko’s continuing campaign for world peace.\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nBorn on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool England, he made his record debut as a member of The Beatles in October 1962 who went on to become the world’s most famous pop group, before they disbanded in 1970. John met Yoko in 1966, and they married in March 1969. While campaigning for world peace through their collaborative conceptual artworks such as the Acorn Peace, Bed-Ins for Peace, and War is Over, they also pursued music together as the Plastic Ono Band after releasing ‘Give Peace A Chance’ which was written during the Bed-Ins. After the breakup of The Beatles, John launched his solo career in 1970 with the release of his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. In 1971, he moved to New York with Yoko and released the album Imagine topping the charts in both the US and England. In 1972, John & Yoko released the album Sometime In New York City and Lennon remained with albums such as Mind Games (’73), Walls and Bridges (’74), Rock ‘n’ Roll (’75). When his son, Sean, was born in 1975, John stepped away from music to focus on family life. In 1980, after 5 years of absence, John & Yoko re-emerged with the release of their album Double Fantasy. John was tragically shot on December 8 shortly after its release. He was 40 years old. John’s works remain to inspire people around the world as his legacy continues to live on withstanding the test of time.\n\nYoko Ono\n\nBorn on February 18, 1933 in Tokyo, she is one of the pioneers of conceptual art, an avant-garde artist and musician. She started showing her work in New York in the late 1950s, and in 1964, she published her artist book Grapefruit. Shortly after meeting John at her exhibition at the Indica Gallery in London in 1966, the two became inseparable and started creating music and artwork together. In 1968, they released their album Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins. Yoko has released a total of 20 albums throughout her career such as Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970) and Fly (1971) and her latest album WARZONE released in 2018. She has also played in various music festivals in Japan including the One Step Festival (Koriyama City, Fukushima 1974) and Fuji Rock Festival (2014). John acknowledged that the song ‘Imagine’ was inspired by Yoko’s book Grapefruit, and in 2017, 46 years after its release in 1971, Yoko’s name was officially added to the song-writing credit as John had wished for. Throughout her career, she continues to blur the boundaries between art and life and has advocated for love and peace in her own unique avant-garde way for over 60 years.\n\nExhibition detail\n\nName: DOUBLE FANTASY – John & Yoko\n\nDate: Friday, October 9th, 2020 – Monday, January 11th, 2021\n\nLocation: Sony Music Roppongi Museum (5-6-20 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo)\n\nPresented by: Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. / Sony Music Labels Inc.\n\nMEDIA PARTNER：The Asahi Shimbun\n\nTickets: Ticket information announcement and actual sales scheduled for the end of August.
