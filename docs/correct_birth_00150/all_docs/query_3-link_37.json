        "text": "Yoko Ono is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, and artist who is also known for her work in performance art and filmmaking. She rose to prominence in the late 1960s with her association with the Beatles’ John Lennon, whom she later married. Her work has been associated with the avant-garde and feminist movements, and she is credited as one of the driving forces behind conceptual and performance art.\n\nOno was born in Tokyo, Japan, on February 18, 1933. Her father was a banker and her mother a stay-at-home wife. Ono was exposed to Western culture at an early age, as her father often took her to see American movies. She also had piano lessons from a young age.\n\nIn 1947, Ono’s family moved to New York City so her father could work at the United Nations. Ono attended school in New York and then later at Sarah Lawrence College. It was during her time at Sarah Lawrence that she met John Lennon. The two became close friends and began collaborating on music.\n\nIn 1968, Ono and Lennon got married. The following year, they released the album Two Virgins, which featured them both nude on the cover. The album was not commercially successful, but it did help to establish Ono as an avant-garde artist.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Ono continued to work with Lennon as well as pursuing her own solo career. She released a number of albums, including 1972’s Fly and 1974’s A Story. In 1980, Lennon was murdered by an obsessed fan. Ono was left devastated by the loss of her husband.\n\nIn the years following Lennon’s death, Ono continued to work on her music and art. She released a number of albums, including 1984’s Milk and Honey and 1986’s Starpeace. She also continued to work in the area of performance art, staging a number of controversial pieces.\n\nOno is still active in the world of music and art. In 2013, she released an album of new material called Take Me to the Land of Hell. She has also continued to work on her visual art, and her work is displayed in museums around the world."
