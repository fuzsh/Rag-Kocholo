        "text": "About\n\nAvant-garde artist, musician, filmmaker, and activist who was best known as the wife of John Lennon from 1969 until 1980. She established the LennonOno Grant for Peace in 2002 and joined Susan Sarandon on the Artists Against Fracking bus tour of rural Pennsylvania in 2013.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nShe fully embraced the bohemian lifestyle while at Sarah Lawrence College, where she was mentored by John Cage. She and Lennon met around 1965 or 1966 and when they became a couple, her fame was guaranteed. What followed were numerous highly publicized events that catapulted her name and her infamy into the headlines, such as the Bed-Ins for Peace.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe was blamed by many Beatles fans for the band's breakup.\n\nFamily Life\n\nShe was born in Japan and waited out the World War II fire bombings of Tokyo in a bunker with her family. She was married three times before she met John Lennon, whom she wed in March of 1969. Their child together, John Ono Lennon II, was miscarried on November 21, 1968, shortly after Lennon's divorce from his wife Cynthia was granted. They would later have Sean, their son, on October 9, 1975.\n\nAssociated With\n\nShe and Lennon's Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney often feuded over songwriting credits following Lennon's death.\n\nVideo"
