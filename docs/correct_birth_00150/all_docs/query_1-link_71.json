        "text": "In Your Mind: The Infinite Universe of Yoko Ono is the first extensive exploration of the artist's amazing life, struggles, art, activism, films and music in astounding detail. No other book tells Yoko’s entire story, which goes way beyond what most people know.\n\nThis is not only a biography - it is the ultimate reference guide to Ono’s work. It is an exploration of Yoko's lonely childhood in Japan during wartime, her art, films, music and work for peace and women's rights.\n\nThe misunderstanding and undeserved negativity that Ono has received as an Asian woman and as the wife of one of the Beatles is explored. We can all learn from her positivity and effective healing methods.\n\nYoko’s life spans thirty-three years before meeting John Lennon, twelve years with him, and over forty years of creativity since his death.\n\nThe author has followed Ono's career since the mid-1960s, has spent personal time with the artist and assembled a vast media archive on her work. Yoko's own voice, along with Lennon's and others (in cited, published interviews) tells her undeniably true story, unravelling many longstanding myths.\n\nYoko's incredible body of work expresses all the joys and suffering of an extraordinary lifetime. It is all examined in this complete biography. The insightful, highly acclaimed book illuminates Ono's spiritual nature and her wisdom.\n\nIncludes the love story of John and Yoko, and her relationship to the Beatles. It's the true story of the woman John Lennon loved.\n\nWebsite:\n\ninyourmindbook.com\n\nSigned Hard Cover Books only available at:\n\nconceptualbooks.com\n\nSocial Media:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/ conceptualbooks"
