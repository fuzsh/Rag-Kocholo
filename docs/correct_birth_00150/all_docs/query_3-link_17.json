        "text": "Where was she born?\n\nYoko Ono was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1933. She now lives in the United States and spent some time there when she was growing up.\n\nWhat is she known for?\n\nShe is known as an artist, a musician, a filmmaker and an activist for peace. She’s made many music albums and has had art exhibitions all around the world.\n\nTell me something about her art!\n\nIn 1964, Yoko Ono published a book of instructions called ‘Grapefruit’... yes, like the fruit!\n\nSome of the instructions are short, just one word long, and others have many parts inviting you to make, move and imagine. If you follow these instructions, on your own or with others, you are invited to take part in artworks. You can fold paper and read. You can dance with chairs. You can make a wish. You can sweep, breathe and whisper – together, alone or even in your mind!"
