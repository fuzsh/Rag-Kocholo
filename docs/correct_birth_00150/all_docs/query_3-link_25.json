        "text": "(born 1933), U.S. artist and musician. Conceptual artist Yoko Ono became an international celebrity when she married musician John Lennon of The Beatles in 1969. The couple worked together on music and promoting world peace until Lennon’s tragic death in 1980.\n\nYoko Ono was born on Feb. 18, 1933, in Tokyo, Japan. Both of her parents were from prominent families, and her father was head of the Bank of Japan. Ono attended an exclusive school and also received private tutoring in English, ballet, and religion. She briefly enrolled at Gakushuin University before moving with her parents to New York, where she attended Sarah Lawrence College for three years but did not earn a degree.\n\nOno became acquainted with the avant-garde scene through her first husband, musician Toshi Ichiyanagi, and by the 1960s was an active participant in the Fluxus movement. Her artistic displays and events frequently encouraged viewer interaction. An exhibit called “Apple” consisted of a pedestal with an apple on it for people to bite. For the performance piece called “Cut,” Ono wore a wedding dress and had audience members slowly cut off bits of the garment until she was naked. Her book ‘Grapefruit’ (1964) presented similar art ideas readers could perform. Her filmmaking ventures included ‘Bottoms’ (1966) and ‘Fly’ (1971).\n\nOno obtained a divorce from second husband Anthony Cox in the late 1960s to wed Lennon, whom she had met at one of her shows at London’s Indica Gallery. Being in the public eye made it difficult for Ono to continue doing her artwork, but the media also helped her and Lennon forward their causes, such as their 1969 “bed-in” at a Toronto hotel to promote world peace.\n\nWhen The Beatles broke up in 1970, rumors circulated that Ono was the cause. Lennon and Ono (or John and Yoko, as they were popularly known) had already put out a few albums—including the controversial Two Virgins (1968), the cover of which featured a photograph of them naked—and continued to perform together and alone. Two of Ono’s solo albums were Approximately Infinite Universe and Feeling the Space (both 1973). Her musical compositions often featured electronic instruments, everyday sounds, and a shrieking style of singing.\n\nThe couple led a private life following the birth of their son Sean in 1975. (Ono also had a daughter from her marriage to Cox.) Ono managed the family’s money and used savvy investment skills to turn it into a substantial fortune. Ono and Lennon returned to the recording studio to make Double Fantasy (1980), featuring seven compositions by each. In December of 1980, Lennon was murdered in front of Ono by a crazed fan. The cover of Ono’s Season of Glass (1981) displayed Lennon’s blood-stained eyeglasses. She later worked on various Lennon memorials and oversaw the release of some of his unpublished material."
