        "text": "In November 2012, Yoko Ono worked in collaboration with the New York boutique Opening Ceremony to create “Fashion for Men: 1969–2012,” a line of avant-garde menswear based on sketches she had made for John Lennon as a present for their 1969 wedding. As Ono told Women’s Wear Daily, “I was inspired to create ‘Fashions for Men’ amazed at how my man was looking so great. I felt it was a pity if we could not make clothes emphasizing his very sexy bod… So, I made this whole series with love for his hot bod and gave it to him as a wedding present. You can imagine how he went wild and fell in love with me even more.” The designs in this collection, rendered in black, white, and hot pink, feature mesh panels, cutouts, and appliqued hands strategically placed over what Ono considered to be the most attractive parts of Lennon’s body. The garments were produced in a limited run: only fifty-two of each style was made."
