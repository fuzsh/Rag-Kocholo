        "text": "Format\n\nEyewitness is a documentary series. Each half-hour episode focuses on a single subject in the field of natural science, such as the Solar System or the various functions of the human body. The information is presented in the \"Eyewitness Museum\", a CGI science museum. Various exhibits are shown, and stock footage is usually seen through large windows or other depressions in the wall. The book series and the show share a striking visual style making notable use of the color white. In addition, almost every episode features a \"Hero\". The Hero is a character or object which drives the action of the show and is continually referred back to. These include the weathervane chicken from Weather, the claymation Legs the Tyrannosaurus from Dinosaur, the paper boat from Pond and River, the salmon from Fish and the robotic Human mime artist from Human Machine.\n\nAndrew Sachs was the original narrator for the series in the United Kingdom. Martin Sheen narrated it for American audiences during the first two seasons, before Sachs took over doing both versions (with separate accents for the countries) in the final season. The series producer was Bill Butt.\n\nWhen the series was released on video, episodes from the first two seasons featured brief behind-the-scenes clips after the main program. In 2003, eight episodes of the program were released onto \"interactive DVDs\". The UK narration were kept in the American releases of these interactive DVDs.\n\nThere are also four Eyewitness Virtual Reality software based on the show: \"Cat\", \"Bird\", \"Dinosaur Hunter\", and \"Earth Quest\".
