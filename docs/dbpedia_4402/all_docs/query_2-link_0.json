The series is based on the Dorling Kindersley Eyewitness Books series of children's books. Guy Michelmore composed the theme music, with Guy Dagul writing additional music in later seasons.\n\nFormat\n\nEyewitness is a documentary series. Each half-hour episode focuses on a single subject in the field of natural science, such as the Solar System or the various functions of the human body. The information is presented in the \"Eyewitness Museum\", a CGI science museum made to replicate the white and empty style of the books. Various exhibits are shown, and stock footage is usually seen through large windows or other depressions in the wall. The book series and the show share a striking visual style making notable use of the color white. In addition, almost every episode features a \"Hero\". The Hero is a character or object which drives the action of the show and is continually referred back to. These include the weathervane rooster from Weather, Legs the claymation Tyrannosaurus from Dinosaur, the paper boat from Pond and River, the hyena from Monster, the salmon from Fish, the crab from Seashore, the cockroach from Prehistoric Life, and the robotic human mime artist from Human Machine.\n\nThe series in the United Kingdom was originally narrated by the late Andrew Sachs, but was taken over by Martin Sheen for American audiences during the first two seasons. However, Sachs took over narrating both versions (with separate accents for the countries) in the final season. The series producer was Bill Butt for the first season, Briget Sneyd for the second season, and Martin Mortimore for the third season.\n\nWhen the series was released on video, episodes from the first two seasons featured brief behind-the-scenes clips after the main program. In 2003, eight episodes of the program were released onto \"interactive DVDs\". The UK narration was kept in the American releases of these interactive DVDs.\n\nThere are also four Eyewitness Virtual Reality software based on the show: \"Cat\", \"Bird\", \"Dinosaur Hunter\", and \"Earth Quest\". One of these, \"Shark\", although seen on the elevator console, was never made.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries 1 (1994)\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1 \"Amphibian\" 5 September 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders\n\n2 \"Bird\" 12 September 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses birds and how they survive\n\n3 \"Cat\" 19 September 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses members of the feline family\n\n4 \"Dinosaur\" 26 September 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses the age of the dinosaurs\n\n5 \"Dog\" 3 October 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses canines\n\n6 \"Elephant\" 10 October 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses elephants and how they survive\n\n7 \"Fish\" 17 October 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses the world of fish\n\n8 \"Horse\" 24 October 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses horse life\n\n9 \"Insect\" 31 October 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses species of insect\n\n10 \"Jungle\" 7 November 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses rainforests\n\n11 \"Reptile\" 14 November 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and snakes\n\n12 \"Shark\" 21 November 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses species of shark and rays\n\n13 \"Skeleton\" 28 November 1994 ( )\n\nDiscusses bones of various animals\n\nSeries 2 (1996)\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1 \"Ape\" 2 September 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses primates\n\n2 \"Arctic and Antarctic\" 9 September 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses polar regions\n\n3 \"Butterfly and Moth\" 16 September 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses species of moth and butterfly\n\n4 \"Desert\" 23 September 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses deserts\n\n5 \"Mammal\" 30 September 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses the world of mammals\n\n6 \"Pond and River\" 7 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses rivers, lakes, and ponds\n\n7 \"Prehistoric Life\" 14 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses how life on earth evolved and changed\n\n8 \"Rock and Mineral\" 21 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses geology\n\n9 \"Seashore\" 28 October 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses beaches\n\n10 \"Shell\" 4 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses animals that have shells\n\n11 \"Tree\" 11 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses trees\n\n12 \"Volcano\" 18 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses volcanoes and earthquakes\n\n13 \"Weather\" 25 November 1996 ( )\n\nDiscusses the sky\n\nSeries 3 (1997)\n\nNo. Title Original air date 1 \"Bear\" 25 August 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses bears and how they live\n\n2 \"Flight\" 1 September 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses flying machines\n\n3 \"Human Machine\" 8 September 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses the human body\n\n4 \"Island\" 15 September 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses islands of the world\n\n5 \"Life\" 22 September 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses biology\n\n6 \"Monster\" 29 September 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses mythical and real-live monsters\n\n7 \"Mountain\" 6 October 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses mountains of the world\n\n8 \"Natural Disasters\" 13 October 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses great disasters\n\n9 \"Ocean\" 20 October 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses seas and oceans\n\n10 \"Planets\" 3 November 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses Solar System from Mercury to Pluto\n\n11 \"Plant\" 10 November 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses the world of plants\n\n12 \"Sight\" 17 November 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses eyes\n\n13 \"Survival\" 24 November 1997 ( )\n\nDiscusses how animals cope with their surroundings\n\nSpecials"
