        "text": "The Wee Care Nursery case\n\nIn 1988, Kelly Michaels (State v. Michaels) was accused of sexually abusing 20 preschool children at the Wee Care Nursery in Maplewood, New Jersey. It began when a former 4-year-old pupil of Michaels had his temperature taken at the paediatrician's office and remarked “That's what my teacher does to me at school” (Manshel, 1990, p. 126). The paediatrician advised the mother to inform the state's child protective agency who interviewed the child two days later. During the interview, the child inserted his finger into the rectum of an anatomical doll. Two other boys were reported by the child to have the same thing happen to them. When questioned, the boys denied this had happened, but one boy did say Michaels touched his penis. Following these initial allegations, the Wee Care Nursery School sent out a letter to parents informing them of an investigation regarding serious allegations. A meeting with a social worker followed this, where the parents were told of the common occurrence of child sex abuse in children. She urged the parents to examine the children for any signs of abuse, including genital soreness, nightmares, bed-wetting and notable changes in behaviour. Soon many more allegations arose (Ceci & Bruck, 1993).\n\nMichaels was accused of raping and abusing these children over a seven-month period during school time. Among the many allegations against Michaels, she was accused of licking peanut butter off children's genitals, playing the piano in the nude and raping them with knives, forks, spoons and Lego blocks (Ceci & Bruck, 1993). None of these alleged acts were ever noticed by other members of staff at the school and none of the parents noticed any physical signs. A jury in the Superior Court of New Jersey convicted Michaels of 115 counts of aggravated assault, sexual assault, endangering the welfare of children and terroristic threats. In 1993, the Appellate Division reversed the convictions based, in part, on an amicus brief (a written brief by a “friend” of the court, someone who is not a party to the case but who offers information bearing on the case such as a legal opinion or an expert or learned treatise) by a committee of concerned scientists that questioned the reliability of the interviewing techniques used with the 20 child complainants. The court held that, “courts must provide a remedy where the record demonstrates that an accuser's testimony is founded upon unreliable perceptions, or memory caused by improper investigative procedures if it results in a defendant's right to a fair trial being irretrievably lost” [see State v. Michaels, 264 N.J.Super. 579, 631-32, 625 A.2d 489 (App. Div.1993)]. The Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the reversal of the judgement of Conviction [see State v. Michaels, 136 N.J. 299, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994)], and on 1 December 1994, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office dismissed all charges against Michaels.\n\nThe McMartin and Wee Care Nursery cases are the most widely documented in the scientific community surrounding child eyewitness testimony. The repeated interviewing, the suggestive and coercive nature of the questioning and the length of the interrogations are among the factors in these cases that ultimately led to many false allegations. Indeed, the transcripts of interviews from these cases highlight how the dynamics of a conversation or interview can be so powerful as to lead children to produce graphic and believable statements of events that never happened to them. In the amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, Bruck and Ceci (1995) demonstrated that these problems were rife in children's interviews and were related to children's suggestibility. Further, they cited specific instances in the interviews from the Michaels case where interviewing techniques were considered to be so faulty that they will have substantially influenced the reliability of children's testimonies leading to reports that were seen as mere reflections of the interviewers' suggestions. Although a complete assessment of these transcripts can be found in a reprinted version of the amicus brief (Bruck & Ceci, 1995), we will briefly highlight some key examples that demonstrate those factors that influence children's susceptibility to suggestion from the interview transcripts of both the Kelly Michaels and McMartin cases (Schreiber et al., 2006).\n\nTo begin, we have seen from previous studies important evidence that interviewers' beliefs about an event can influence their style of questioning and, in turn, the accuracy of a child's testimony. For example, White, Leichtman, and Ceci (1997) provided interviewers with reports of a scripted event that had been acted out with preschool children. The event involved physical touching, carrying out unusual actions and acting or observing another child's actions. Unknown to the interviewers, some of the events described in the report were incorrect. All children were interviewed twice, once after a month and again after two months had elapsed. The interviewer was asked to conduct an interview to elicit the most factually accurate report from the children. Results showed that the interviewer's questioning was biased to the details provided in the report of the event. Furthermore, younger children agreed more often than older children to questions based on incorrect information. Children agreed more readily to unusual (e.g., children had put marbles in the researchers ear) incorrect events, and younger children's reports became more inaccurate with misleading information over time. Many would also make inaccurate elaborations even after they had originally correctly rejected queries about events that did not happen. For example, when asked, “Did you kiss the researcher?” a child might rightly answer “No” but then comment “but the researcher kissed me.”\n\nThe effect of interviewer bias and the failure to test alternate explanations for children's behaviour and answers can be seen in the interviews from children in the Michaels case (Bruck & Ceci, 1995). There are many instances where the interviewer persisted with a particular line of inquiry (using repeated leading questions, bribes and threats) even after the child denies the event occurred, or after the child provides a bizarre or inconsistent statement that should be followed up. Because the interviewers held preconceived biases, and believed that the major objective was to get children to admit that they had been sexually abused, the interviewers did not consider that such statements might show that the children were confused. Moreover, the interviewers made no attempt to make sense of what the children were saying; that is, whether the children were just pretending, telling a joke or repeating something that had been said to them previously. We see evidence of such a bizarre dialogue below in an interview with one of the Michaels children:\n\nInterviewer: Do you think that Kelly was not good when she was hurting you all?\n\nChild: Wasn't hurting me. I like her\n\nInterviewer: I can't hear you, you got to look at me when you talk to me. Now when Kelly was bothering kids in the music room\n\nChild: I got socks off\n\nInterviewer: Did she make anybody else take their clothes off in the music room?\n\nChild: No\n\nInterviewer: Yes\n\nChild: No\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, p. 276)\n\nA range of suggestive techniques has been identified in the transcripts from the McMartin and Michaels cases. This category can cover a large range of suggestive influences. Schreiber et al. (2006) highlight five kinds of techniques: (1) reinforcement, (2) repetition of questions, (3) co-witness information (peer pressure from other children), (4) inviting speculation and (5) introducing new information. Reinforcement can take a positive or negative form. Positive reinforcement involves praising the child for something they have said or something they could say that will please the interviewer:\n\nInterviewer: So I bet if you guys put on your thinking caps, you can help remember it. Now let's make a test of your brain and see how good your memories are.\n\n(McMartin Interview No. 107, pp. 32–33, 38)\n\nA negative reinforcement or consequence occurs when a child's answer is criticised or disagreed with. This indicates to the child that the statement is inadequate and dubious. Repetition of questions can also be considered as a form of negative feedback, as the child sees that the previous answer given was unacceptable. This is usually associated with choice questions and research has shown a reduction in accuracy of children's reports using repetition (Poole & White, 1991, 1995). The McMartin and Michaels interviewers frequently used repeated questions when a child denied abuse or when the child's answer was inconsistent with what the interviewers believed. In many exchanges, the children would at first consistently reject the suggestive questions, but with repetition, the child would change their answers:\n\nInterviewer: When Kelly kissed you, did she ever put her tongue in your mouth?\n\nChild: No\n\nInterviewer: Did she ever make you put your tongue in her mouth?\n\nChild: No\n\nInterviewer: Did you ever have to kiss her vagina?\n\nChild: No\n\nInterviewer: Which of the kids had to kiss her vagina?\n\nChild: What's this?\n\nInterviewer: No that's my toy, my radio box. Which kids had to kiss her vagina?\n\nChild: Me\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, p. 280)\n\nWe know from previous research that reinforcement (both positive and negative) can have a profound effect on children's behaviour and has considerable influence when used in child interviews. In a controlled laboratory-based study, Garven, Wood, and Malpass (2000) provided evidence for this effect. Here, children (5- to 7-year-olds) were visited in their classroom by a young man known as Paco Perez. A week later the children were interviewed about the visit using leading questions that were either mundane (“Did Paco break a toy while he was visiting?”) or fantastic (“Did Paco take you somewhere in a helicopter?”). Half of the children were further reinforced with praise for answers that included false allegations regarding Paco and mild negative feedback for answers that did not implicate Paco. Reinforced children (35%) made more false accusations against Paco than non-reinforced children (12%). Interestingly, for fantastic questions, the false accusation rate was 52% for reinforced children versus 5% for non-reinforced children. Furthermore, when interviewed a week later without reinforcement or leading questions, the children reinforced at the previous interview continued to make accusations at about the same rate as previously.\n\nResearch has shown that co-witness information is a form of “social proof” that leads to conformity pressure to go along with other child witnesses (Leichtman & Ceci, 1995) and can be seen throughout the transcripts from the day care cases:\n\nInterviewer: You see all the kids in this picture? Every single kid in this picture has come here and talked to us. Isn't that amazing? … These kids came to visit us and we found out they know a lot of yucky old secrets from that old school. And they all came and told us the secrets. And they're helping us figure out this whole puzzle of what used to go on in that place.\n\n(McMartin Interview No. 107, pp. 16–17)\n\nInterviewer: All the other friends I talked to told me everything that happened. 29C told me. 32C told me … And now it's your turn to tell. You don't want to be left out, do you?\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, p. 283)\n\nParents had also told their children that other children had named them as victims. Bruck and Ceci refer to Child 1C who finally disclosed his “abuse” to his mother but only after she had told him that others had mentioned him as a participant.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Michaels and McMartin children were continually asked to speculate whether a particular event could have happened or indeed asked to pretend that an event had happened. Research has shown that such techniques lead to errors in children's recollections due to failures of source monitoring. Inviting speculation may have profound effects on the accuracy of later recall because it is a form of self-generated misinformation. Research shows that when children are asked to “picture in their head” a particular event, false assent not only occurs, but increases across multiple sessions and continues even when the children are informed that the interviewer asked them to imagine events that did not really happen (e.g., Ceci, Loftus, Leichtman, & Bruck, 1994). Evidence of inviting speculation occurred frequently in the day care interviews, with children often been asked to imagine how certain instruments could be used to abuse the children, and asking the children to show on anatomical dolls where their teacher may have touched them and other children in their class:\n\nInterviewer: Why don't you show me how you think a little girl can be hurt by the fork?\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, p. 292)\n\nAlthough with age, children become less susceptible to misinformation, introducing new information can increase false allegations at all ages. Schreiber et al. (2006) conducted a quantitative analysis of instances of new information in the McMartin and Michaels cases as well as a set of Child Protective Services (CPS) interviews. These were 100 sexual abuse interviews from the CPS and considered as “normal” interviews that created a comparison group. An interviewer question or statement only received a rating for introducing information if it (1) introduced new material that was sexual, violent or negative in content, (2) was contradictory or substantially inconsistent with the child's previous statements or (3) referred to unusual and highly specific events or ideas (e.g., being flown away from school in a helicopter) not previously mentioned by the child. For example:\n\nInterviewer: How about Naked Movie Star? You guys remember that game?\n\nChild: No.\n\nInterviewer: Everybody remembered that game. Let's see if we can figure it out.\n\n(McMartin Interview 107, p. 32)\n\nWhile just under 20% of the statements and questions from the McMartin and Michaels interviews involved new information, only 3% of statements in the CPS interviews contained new information or information not consistent with the child's statements.\n\nAlthough considerable research in the misinformation field has examined the effect of single instances of implanted misinformation, if children are repeatedly given misinformation in a series of interviews, it can have serious consequences on the accuracy of their later reports (Andrews & Lamb, 2014; Bruck & Ceci, 1995). Misinformation not only becomes incorporated into children's subsequent reports but also tends to increase fabrication rates that do not always directly mirror the content of the misleading information. For example, Bruck, Ceci, Francoeur, and Renick (1995) interviewed children about an event that happened approximately 1 year earlier. Children visited a paediatrician's office where a male paediatrician gave each child a physical examination, an oral polio vaccine and an inoculation. During this visit, a female research assistant also talked to the child about a poster, read them a story and gave them some treats. They were re-interviewed four times over a one-month period. Some of the children were asked misleading questions that suggested the roles were reversed and that the research assistant completed the examination and gave them the inoculation and vaccine. Other children acted as controls and received no misleading questions regarding the research assistant and paediatrician. In the final interview, children were asked to freely recall what happened during the visit to the paediatrician. Children in the control group provided highly accurate information, whereas more than half of the children in the misled group reported that the female research assistant gave them the physical examination. Interestingly, of these children, 45% also included non-suggested but inaccurate details (e.g., reported that the assistant had checked their ears and nose). Although there is no clear figure of the number of times children in the day care cases were exposed to repeated (mis)leading questions, children were questioned by their parents, by therapists, members of the prosecutors' office leading up to the trial and by the prosecution and defense attorneys at the trial. When suggestions are implanted, not only can they become incorporated into the report but are used in highly productive ways to distort reality, something that is highly likely to have occurred in the day care cases discussed here.\n\nWe have referred to a substantial number of suggestive interview techniques that have been shown to have considerable impact on the accuracy of children's reports. However, there are several other related factors that ultimately led Bruck and Ceci (1995) to conclude that the conditions under which the children were interviewed were “unsafe.” For example, young children are sensitive to the status and power of their interviewers. If a young child is being interviewed by someone they perceive to be an authority that child will be unlikely to challenge something that has been said by that person. Bruck and Ceci (1995) state that this power differential is one of the most important factors in the susceptibility to suggestion in children. Research has shown this fact to be true (see Ceci & Bruck, 1993) and the Michaels interviews show repeated reference to the status and trustworthiness of the interviewer, referring to their connection with law enforcement:\n\nI'm a policeman, if you were a bad girl, I would punish you wouldn't I? Police can punish bad people\n\nI'm going to introduce you to one of the men who arrested Kelly and put her in jail.\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, p. 286)\n\nBruck and Ceci (1995) also highlight the (mis)use of anatomically detailed dolls during the Michaels interviews. Dolls are often used by professionals working with children to help cue recall, overcome language problems and to provide a way to communicate if they are shy or embarrassed. Excessive preoccupation with the genitalia or distress shown when they are undressed is believed to show signs of abuse (Mason, 1991). However, research has shown that dolls are suggestive and can encourage sexualised play even if the child has not been abused (e.g., Gardner, 1989; Terr, 1988). Ceci and Bruck (1993) found that after a routine examination with a paediatrician (some of which included a genital examination), 3-year-old children were inaccurate when reporting how and where they were touched. Children who were not touched demonstrated with dolls that they were touched, whereas some of the children that were touched falsely showed that penetration had occurred. Children also demonstrated a number of other bizarre behaviours. When asked what the doctor did with a stethoscope, some children suggested it was used on their genitals. When asked, “How he might use a spoon?” a small number of children inserted it into the genital or anal opening of the doll.\n\nThe use of anatomical dolls seems significant in the Michaels interviews. Bruck and Ceci (1995) reported that anatomical dolls were shown to children in 24 of the 39 interviews before sexual abuse was reported by the child. Many suggestive aspects of the interviews involved sexualised questioning in the context of demonstrations with the dolls. For example, children were asked to speculate about how silverware could have been used:\n\nInterviewer: Why don't you show me how you think a little girl can be hurt by the fork?\n\nAnd\n\nInterviewer: Why don't you show me what Kelly did with the big wooden spoon.\n\nOften, as shown above, the children resisted these suggestions, but sometimes after much repetition, the children responded by poking the silverware into the genitalia or buttocks of the doll:\n\nInterviewer: Can you think of a way somebody might have used this to hurt little girls?\n\nChild: (indicates the tummy)\n\nInterviewer: Where else do you think a little girl could have gotten hurt with a wooden spoon?\n\nChild: The belly button.\n\nInterviewer: Where else do you think a little girl might get hit with a wooden spoon? How do you think Kelly used this fork to hurt little girls?\n\nChild: Belly button.\n\nInterviewer: Where else?\n\n(finally after many more persistent questions)\n\nChild: Bottom.\n\n(Michaels Interview, Bruck & Ceci, 1995, pp. 292–293)\n\nNote here the similarities with the paediatrician study when children were asked what the doctor might do with a spoon. Professionals are now cautious of the use of anatomical dolls with young children as their use promotes sexualised behaviour and false reports in non-abused children.\n\nFurther factors such as interview length and types of questioning have also been linked to reliability issues in forensic interviewing of children and false memory development (see Ceci & Bruck, 1993, 1995; Poole & Lamb, 1998). Interview length concerns not only the measure of temporal length of the interview but also the number of utterances per interview. Interview length becomes a concern if young children show signs of fatigue or wandering attention (e.g., Home Office, 2002). Published guidelines for child forensic interviews also emphasise the importance of allowing children to talk at length and describe in their own words, the experiences in question (Home Office, 2002; Poole & Lamb, 1998). Often, however, the interviewer can be seen to do considerably more talking than the child. In fact, the ratio of interviewer words to child words has been used as a rough indicator of suggestive and unskilful interviewing (Underwager & Wakefield, 1990). In a quantitative analysis of interview length and ratio of utterances, Schreiber et al. (2006) found that the McMartin interviews lasted approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes, whereas the Michaels interviews lasted approximately 23 minutes. In both cases there were significantly more interviewer compared to child words (ratio = 4.60 and 4.67, respectively). Guidelines for interviewing children typically recommend that the interviewer utilise open-ended (“Tell me what happened”) or free narrative questions where possible (American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, 2002; Home Office, 2002; Poole & Lamb, 1998). They are more likely to lead to accurate accounts of an event and reduce opportunity for suggestion. However, young children are not always capable of providing detailed narratives so guidelines also indicate that open-ended questions can be followed up with yes/no questions (“Did it happen more than once?”), choice questions (“Was it night time or day time?”) or focused/specific questions (“Where did it happen?”). However, such questions should be used sparingly and should be of a non-suggestive nature. Unfortunately, in child forensic interviews such questions are often overused and used in a suggestive manner. Schreiber et al. (2006) reported that the majority of questions in the McMartin and Michaels interviews were of the yes/no form followed by focused/specific, with only around 10% of the questions being free recall/open narrative.\n\nWe have presented a number of features that, when present in interviews or interactions with young children, may greatly compromise the accuracy of their reports. Many of these features, as well as others, were highlighted after the widely publicised day care cases and the need for a systematic change was called for when it came to the investigative interviewing of children. This systematic change came in the form of interviewing protocols and the procedures that should be used when interviewing children. We now take a closer look at the development of these protocols.\n\nExpert professional groups have offered recommendations regarding the most effective ways of conducting forensic or investigative interviews with children (e.g., American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, 1990, 1997; Home Office, 1992, 2002; Jones, 2003; Lamb, 1994; Orbach, Hershkowitz, Lamb, Sternberg, Esplin, & Horowitz, 2000; Poole & Lamb, 1998). Such recommendations all state that the interview should be conducted as soon as possible after the alleged event by interviewers who introduce as little information as possible while encouraging as much information as possible from the child using open-ended questions to elicit narratives of the event. Before substantive details of the event are discussed, the interviewer should explain their role, the purpose of the interview and set “ground rules” (describe only events that “really happened,” use “don't know,” correct the interviewer if they are wrong and ask for clarification if they do not understand a question). Interviewers are urged to use open-ended questions as the norm, only use recognition prompts or yes/no and forced choice questions later in the interview, and only when needed to elicit undisclosed forensically relevant information (Lamb et al., 2007). Research has shown that open-ended questions are much more likely to elicit accurate information than that elicited using more focused recognition responses (Lamb & Fauchier, 2001; Orbach & Lamb, 1999, 2001). This is likely because open-ended questions force the child to recall information from memory, whereas more focused prompts, provided by the interviewer, often only require the child to recognise information. Interviewers are advised not to use yes/no or forced choice questions because we have seen how suggestive they can be.\n\nHowever, despite this research and the expert-endorsed recommendations, such interviewer techniques were seldom followed. Lamb et al. (2007) reported that descriptive studies of forensic interviews from the USA, UK, Canada, Sweden, Finland and Israel consistently showed little use of open-ended prompts, and that interviewers, even if they had been trained in proper procedures, frequently deviated from these recommendations, usually being unaware they had done so.\n\nBecause forensic interviewers often have difficulty adhering to recommended interview practices in the field, Michael Lamb and colleagues at the NICHD developed a structured interview protocol designed to translate professional recommendations into operational guidelines (Lamb et al., 2007; Orbach et al., 2000). The structured NICHD Protocol provides explicit instructions to guide interviewers through all phases of the investigative interview, from the initial introductory phase, the rapport-building phase that accustoms children to the open-ended interview style while building a relationship with the interviewer, to the substantive phase which identifies a series of open-ended prompts to identify the target, and finally to the directive questioning phase to cover crucial details that are still missing (see for a breakdown of these phases).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nPhase I: IntroductionThe interviewer introduces him/herself, clarifies the child's task (the need to describe events in detail and to tell the truth), and explains the ground rules and expectations (i.e., that the child can and should say “I don't remember”, “I don't know”, “I don't understand”, or correct the interviewer when appropriate). Examples are provided to ascertain whether the child understands these rules.\n\n‘And if I say things that are wrong, you should tell me. Okay?’\n\n‘So if I said that you are a 2-year-old girl [when interviewing a 5-year-old boy, etc.], what would you say?’Phase II: Rapport buildingThe interviewer aims to create a relaxed, supportive environment for children and to establish rapport between children and interviewer. The interviewer asks a series of questions to get to know the child better.\n\n‘Tell me about things you like to do.’Phase III: Training in episodic memoryChildren are prompted to describe a recently experienced neutral event in detail. This “training” is designed to familiarise children with the open-ended investigative strategies and techniques used in the substantive phase while demonstrating the specific level of detail expected of them\n\n‘A few [days/weeks] ago was [holiday/birthday party/the first day of school/other event]. Tell me everything that happened on [your birthday, Easter, etc.].’\n\nAnd then what happened?\n\n‘Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.’Phase IV: Substantive interviewThis stage consists of a number of sub stages that include the transition to the substantive issues:\n\n‘Now that I know you a little better, I want to talk about why [you are here] today.’\n\nFollowed by open-ended questions related to the allegations\n\n‘Tell me everything about that.’\n\n‘Then what happened?’ or ‘Tell me more about that.’\n\nOnce the child has provided a narration of the allegation using open-ended prompts the interviewer can move on to elicit information that has not been mentioned by the child. For example:\n\n‘When you told me about the time in the basement, you mentioned that he took off his trousers. Did something happen to your clothes?’ [Wait for an answer.] [After the child responds, say:]\n\n‘Tell me all about that.’\n\n‘I see [I heard] that you have [marks/bruises] on your [––––––––––]. Tell me everything about that.’\n\nThe interview closes after the child has been asked if they have any questions. The interviewer finishes by asking a neutral topic question such as where they are going after they leave today.\n\nThe findings obtained in independent field studies in four different countries (e.g., Cyr, Lamb, Pelletier, Leduc, & Perron, 2006; Lamb, Orbach, Warren, Esplin, & Hershkowitz, 2006; Orbach et al., 2000) demonstrate the effectiveness of the NICHD Protocol. When forensic investigators employ the structured NICHD Protocol, they enhance the accuracy and quality of information elicited from alleged victims of all ages. Research has shown that when using the protocol at least three times more open-ended questions are used and there is an approximate 50% drop in the number of option based and suggestive prompts in comparison to similar interviews not using the protocol. The protocol is also effective with young children with about half of the informative and forensically relevant details and more than 80% of the initial disclosures of sexual abuse being provided by preschoolers in response to free recall prompts. These findings show that interviewers should only introduce information if essential information is still missing after free recall and directive prompts have been exhausted because these alternatives are more likely to elicit inaccurate information and their introduction may contaminate any additional information provided.\n\nThe NICHD Protocol is informed by current research into child forensic interviewing and remains a “work-in-progress” (Hershkowitz, Lamb, & Katz, 2014; Pipe, Orbach, Lamb, Abbott, & Stewart, 2013; for recent, comprehensive review, see Lamb, Malloy, Hershkowitz, & La Rooy, in press). Nevertheless, the structure of the protocol provides trained interviewers with a more universal and useable set of guidelines that can be easily adhered to. The end result is a protocol that can elicit accounts that are more likely to be accurate and less likely to be challenged in court. If experienced interviewers can follow guidelines like the structured protocol and continue to review their interviews with other experienced interviewers then even children as young as 4 years of age can provide accurate and forensically usable information about their experiences when interviewed (Lamb et al., 2007).\n\nIs there a special case for repressed memories?\n\nResearch has shown us that all memories, regardless of whether they are for traumatic or mundane events that occur in childhood, adolescence or adulthood are subject to decay, forgetting, interference and other memory mechanisms that inevitably lead to constructive errors and memory distortion. This becomes particularly important when we consider the common misbelief that memories for stressful and traumatic events can be protected via some “special memory mechanism”. For example, allegations of repressed and recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse typically rely on repressive or dissociative mechanisms that render painful material inaccessible to consciousness (e.g., Briere & Conte, 1993; Elliot & Briere, 1995). The belief is that when these recollections do return, such events are presumed unlikely to be forgotten in “ordinary” ways, being protected from the ravages of time and immune to the normal laws of memory. However, others have stated that there is no scientific evidence for the existence of these special memory mechanisms and instead caution the use of suggestive memory recovery techniques to “unlock” repressed memories. Such caution is based on a long history of research and scientific data supporting the premise that human memory is highly suggestible and malleable (see Ceci & Loftus, 1994). Based on this evidence it is plausible to believe that false memories may be inadvertently created by risky therapeutic methods used in many of the recovered memory claims (e.g., hypnosis, guided imagery; Ceci & Loftus, 1994).\n\nSuch advocates of recovered memories claim that adults who were abused as children, but have complete amnesia of the abuse, will demonstrate a variety of symptoms as a result of the abuse (Bass & Davis, 2008; Dolan, 1991; Fredrickson, 1992). Typically authors that list such symptoms as a “self-diagnosis checklist,” provide no information regarding the scientific basis of the CSA link to such symptoms. Bass and Davis (2008) list 74 characteristics associated with sexual abuse. The list includes such attributes as relationship difficulties, feeling dissatisfied with family relationships, sexual dysfunction, trouble expressing feeling, and feeling different. Dolan (1991) believes that when a client is exhibiting symptoms indicative of abuse, it is the role of the therapist to assist the client in recalling the repressed abuse. Similar to Bass and Davis, the symptoms Dolan describes include a wide range of problems. These include dreams of being pursued, sleep disturbances, eating disorders, substance abuse, compulsive sexuality, sexual dysfunction, chronic anxiety attacks, depression, difficulties with relationships, distrust of others, guilt, impaired self-esteem, self-destructive behaviours, and personality disorders. Unfortunately, these attributes, so general as they are, could apply to any number of behavioural and psychological problems, or indeed, to some extent be applied to everyone.\n\nKihlstrom (1999) states that although it may be true that abuse victims may display many of these signs and symptoms, it does not follow that everyone who displays these attributes is an abuse victim. However, when patients come to therapists, they are looking for answers to explain any behavioural or psychological problems they are experiencing. If the therapist concludes that the patient is a victim of abuse, then with the recovered-memory techniques that quickly ensue, it is not surprising if reports of abuse arise. If a criminal or civil claim is subsequently filed, the problem the court faces is one of knowing whether the report reflects a real experience or an iatrogenic false memory. Because a memory is not triggered it is reconstructed (Bartlett, 1932; Kihlstrom & Barnhardt, 1993), whether the recollection is reconstructed from a historically accurate event is the key question that needs to be addressed before a decision can be made about an alleged perpetrator's guilt or innocence.\n\nWe have seen that the absence of a mature autobiographical memory system and its subsequent emergence and development in later childhood (after the age of 5–7 years) has been well documented in both behavioural and neurological studies (Howe, 2011, 2013a). Before this age we typically refer to a period of infantile and childhood amnesia where memories are poorly formed and typically forgotten. In fact, Howe (2013a) states more stable, adult-like autobiographical memories are rarely seen before the age of 9–10 years, and even then, recalling events from this period will only be possible if they are particularly distinctive and memorable. However, by some twist of logic, self-help guides (e.g., Bass & Davis, 2008) and therapists take the very fact that someone cannot remember their abuse to be evidence that they were abused. Bass and Davis make no reference to childhood amnesia or the maturation of brain structures that allow for the long-term recollection of autobiographical memories. Instead they make claims such as this:\n\nIf you don't remember your abuse, you are not alone. Many women don't have memories, and some never get any memories. This doesn't mean they weren't abused. (p. 81)\n\nIf you are unable to remember specific instances … but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did. (p. 21)\n\nIt is important to note here that prominent critics of memory-recovery work such as Loftus, Freyd, and Lindsay do not assert that all recovered memory reports are false. Indeed there are many cases where memories of CSA emerge after long periods of forgetting. Instead, such critics claim that there is no scientific evidence for a special repression mechanism and that memory-recovery work can lead to iatrogenic false memories. It is not implied that all accounts of recovered CSA are false, or that all memory-recovery techniques will always inevitably lead to the formation of false memories (their research alone shows this is not the case), but that the creation of false memories do occur, and the false beliefs of these events can be held confidently (Lindsay & Read, 1994; Loftus, 1993).\n\nToday we have a clearer understanding of the uncertainty of recovered memory techniques and their use to “unlock” recovered memories of abuse. Official statements by the American Psychological Association, Board of Trustees (1993) have been made regarding uncorroborated recovered memories of CSA. They clarify the need to be aware of the issues of false accusations while not discrediting the reports of patients who have indeed been traumatised by actual previous abuse. Basic clinical and ethical principles should guide the psychiatrist's work in this difficult area. Such statements emphasise that care must be taken to avoid prejudging the cause of the patient's difficulties, or the veracity of the patient's reports. A strong prior belief by the psychiatrist that sexual abuse, or other factors, are or are not the cause of the patient's problems is likely to interfere with appropriate assessment and treatment. Clinicians should not exert pressure on patients to believe in events that may not have occurred. Clinicians need specialised training to treat patients who report the emergence of memories during specialised interview techniques (e.g., hypnosis, guided imagery).\n\nAs Rogers (1992, 1994) noted, valid claims may arise in therapy, but typically in these cases the therapist did not use intrusive and suggestive techniques and the patient will not have been placed into influential group treatment until the abuse had been fully documented. Thus, medical records must be carefully examined in any court case. The overwhelming issue is that there is no litmus test to distinguish between true and false memories (see Bernstein & Loftus, 2009; Schacter, Chamberlain, Gaesser, & Gerlach, 2012). Therefore, when a memory is uncovered in therapy, it is the role of the therapist to verify empirically, any uncovered event. Because of the lack of consensus in the scientific community for the theory of repression and the inability to determine truthfulness of a specific repressed memory allegation without corroborative evidence, repressed memory claims present special equitable and evidentiary problems for the courts (Amicus curiae: Minnesota Supreme Court, Doe 76C v. Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Diocese of Winona, 2011), something we turn to next.\n\nThere was a surge in cases involving claims of recovered memories when courts and legislatures in many states created legal mechanisms for both criminal and civil actions based on recovered memories (Loftus & Rosenwald, 1995). In cases involving claims of recovered memories, one party aims to prove the existence of repressed memories, while the other party provides a counterclaim, denying the abuse occurred and argues that memories recovered in therapy should be inadmissible in court. Here the question has been, which party has the sustainable claim to scientific knowledge (Underwager & Wakefield, 1998). Taub (1999) provides a full review of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) Legal Survey, but here we highlight some of the prominent historical cases based on claims of recovered memory."
