I just got done playing Pokemon Red, I am watching this in my class, and after school I am going to go home and watch Digimon. There is no COVID-19 pandemic. Everything is alright with the world.\n\nI also don't know what Kamen Rider is, so maybe it's a worse tradeoff.\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n#7\n\nHmmm, looks like this is a UK thing i don't recognize.\n\nThis is the british children's television show (Specifically, it's from Vision On) music i recognize, thanks to it taking a modern life of it's own thanks to the LittleBigPlanet series. There was even an \"8-bit\" remix made for the game.\n\n(Unsurprisingly, there's also a \"left bank one\" that has been completely forgotten nowadays.)\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n#8\n\nPretty sure Tier Zoo uses this song quite a bit. Unlike a lot of the video game tracks he uses, I didn’t recognize the source and thought it might have been an original composition for the channel, always wondering why it went so much harder than I’d expect. Well, there’s the answer.\n\nbatfax\n\nSinow Beat\n\nJan 30, 2022\n\n#9\n\nthe hottest edutainment jam of all time\n\nstep aside bill\n\nValanarro\n\nRattata\n\nPronouns\n\nThey/Them\n\nFeb 8, 2022\n\n#10\n\nMy friends and I still talk about how this and a chemistry educational program that we watched in high school had an intro that goes way harder than it needs to. Wish I could find it again."
