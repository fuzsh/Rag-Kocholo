Much like the trend toward nonlive procedures in criminal cases, eyewitness scientists have relied almost exclusively on photo lineups (though video lineups are becoming increasingly common, particularly in U.K. research). The paucity of experimental research presents a challenge for the live superiority hypothesis; even if every experimental result supported it, the evidence would not be compelling.

(2015) found only three experiments that compared live and video procedures with lineups that did or did not contain the target participants were trying to identify. Composite measures of target-present and target-absent performance revealed a slight advantage for live over video lineups in two of the experiments (difference in proportion of correct responses ranged from 4% to 6%; Cutler, Fisher, & Chicvara, 1989; Kerstholt, Koster, & van Amelsvoort, 2004). The third experiment showed a trend in the opposite direction (another very small difference in percent correct: 2%; Cutler & Fisher, 1990), but Clark et al. warned against interpreting the data from this experiment because the witnessed event had two target actors and the lineups were always target-present for one actor and target-absent for the other.\n\nAdditional comparisons between video and live lineups can be found in the literature, but they are not particularly informative. A central concern with these additional experiments is that their lineups always included the target (Brace, Pike, Kemp, & Turner, 2009; Shepherd, Ellis, & Davies, 1982). Without a measure of choosing when the target is absent, it is unclear whether a higher correct identification rate is indicative of better decision-making or an indirect consequence of an increased willingness to make an identification, which would increase the chance of a lucky guess landing on the target. Even without this caveat, these experiments have been equivocal. Shepherd et al. reported that live presentation increased the correct identification rate compared to video presentation in one experiment but reported the opposite effect in another experiment (for similar results using a showup identification test, see Valentine, Davis, Memon, & Roberts, 2012). Brace et al. compared live and video lineups, but they were primarily interested in the effect of the procedures on witness anxiety. Different targets and lineup members were used for the live and video lineups, so the identification responses were not comparable (note also that correct identification rates were uniformly low: 0% and 9%, respectively).\n\nAs we move now to comparisons between live and photo lineups (see ), the early research of Dent and Stephenson (1979) draws attention to the medium’s effect on the psychological state of the witness. In their first experiment, Dent and Stephenson observed signs of discomfort, self-consciousness, and embarrassment among participants as they inspected the row of men standing for a live lineup. Compared to those who saw a photo lineup instead, participants in the live condition made fewer correct identifications and spent less time looking at each lineup member. Similar reactions, if not more pronounced, were observed in their second experiment, with child witnesses. In the live lineup condition, children appeared “frightened” and were unwilling to look closely at the lineup members. Some were so upset they could not complete the task. Even convincing the children to walk up and down the lineup in the first place required some nudging. In light of these behavioral observations, it may be unsurprising that the odds of a correct identification for children who received a photo lineup were 3.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] [1.45, 6.25]) times the odds for those assigned to the live lineup. Dent and Stephenson explored procedures intended to make live lineups more bearable for children in a third experiment, but strong conclusions were precluded by a ceiling effect (descriptive statistics for each procedure were not reported). In their fourth experiment, this time with adults, correct identifications were highest for live lineups viewed through a screen, second-highest for photo lineups, and lowest for live lineups viewed without a screen.\n\nOne observation from Dent and Stephenson’s (1979) work is that participants seemed reluctant to make an identification while in the presence of the lineup members. Across three experiments, the rates of nonidentification were consistently higher for live lineups than for photo lineups. The only exception was when the live lineup was separated from the witness by a screen. In that experiment, the odds of a nonidentification for the live lineup with no screen were 4.14 (95% CI [1.80, 9.57]) times as great as the odds for the live lineup with a screen. Although the absence of target-absent lineups in Dent and Stephenson’s experiments precludes any firm conclusions about the identification medium’s effect on response bias, other studies that have included target-absent conditions are consistent with the suggestion that witnesses are less inclined to identify a lineup member if presented in person than if presented via photo or video (Cutler & Fisher, 1990; Kerstholt et al., 2004; Peters, 1991).\n\nIn summary, the experimental literature lends no empirical support for the live superiority hypothesis. If anything, the data converge on the conclusion that witnesses are less likely to identify any of the lineup members if they are observed in person than if they are viewed with videos or photos. Keep in mind, however, that the small number of empirical comparisons involving live lineups limits what can be inferred from this literature.\n\nPhoto Versus Video\n\nTo begin our discussion of photo and video comparisons, the most recent review of the identification medium requires some unpacking. Using meta-analysis, Clark et al. (2015) found that increasing the information available in a lineup can improve identification outcomes. The meta-analysis summarized data from six experiments, three older (Cutler & Penrod, 1988; Cutler, Penrod, & Martens, 1987; O’Rourke, Penrod, Cutler, & Stuve, 1989) and three more recent (Darling, Valentine, & Memon, 2008; Kerstholt et al., 2004; Valentine, Darling, & Memon, 2007). All of the “less information” lineups included photos and all of the “more information” lineups included videos, but Clark and colleagues were careful to avoid labeling them all “photo lineups” and “video lineups” because of idiosyncrasies in the earlier work. For instance, in two experiments (Cutler & Penrod, 1988; Cutler et al., 1987) participants had access to photo images while they observed either video clips (more information) or another set of photo images (less information). The earlier experiments, including the one by O’Rourke et al., were further confounded by accompanying the video clips with voice samples and full-body views but not doing the same with the photo images. Because of these factors, the advantage Clark et al. reported for the lineups with more information cannot be squarely attributed to the use of video.\n\nContemporary experiments provide more straightforward comparisons between photo and video lineups, but even they do not isolate the identification medium’s effect. In research comparing U.K. videos with static photos, for example, the lineup members are always portrayed turning from left to right in the video condition, but only portrayed in frontal pose in the photo condition (Beresford & Blades, 2006; Darling et al., 2008; Havard, Memon, Clifford, & Gabbert, 2010; Seale-Carlisle & Mickes, 2016; Valentine et al., 2007). Thus, the video and photo lineups consistently differed in (a) the identification medium and (b) the visible angles of the face. Although a moving face is easier to recognize than the same number of frames presented as an array of static images (Lander, Christie, & Bruce, 1999), this confound nevertheless leaves open the possibility that including static profile views in the photo condition would eliminate any observed improvements for video lineups.\n\nConfounds are pervasive in the lineup medium literature, perhaps for good reason. Rather than a single variable with different levels, each identification medium is a “constellation of variables” (Clark et al., 2015). In applied settings, an identification medium is inherently associated with factors beyond the medium itself. At a live lineup witnesses typically can view the lineup members in their entirety; at a photo or video lineup witnesses typically see only the head and shoulders. Live and video lineups can be dynamic; photo lineups are inherently static. Live and photo lineups can be presented sequentially or simultaneously; videos lineups are naturally sequential. Because of these natural co-occurrences, the ecological validity of an experiment may be increased by the inclusion of confounds.\n\nResearchers must decide whether a gain in ecological validity is worth the loss in experimental control. To resolve this dilemma, imagine a pure test of the identification medium. The photo condition might display a frontal-view head shot of each lineup member, which could then be matched in the video and live conditions by arranging for only the heads of the lineup members to be visible and instructing them to face squarely forward and remain still. If the objective were to isolate the effect of the medium, this manipulation would seem to provide a reasonable method of achieving it. But would a null finding be enough to recommend that practitioners abandon video and live testing and opt for the more convenient method of photo testing? On the contrary, the findings would have little if any relevance to investigatory practices because it is the additional factors made possible through live and video lineups that underscores the appeal of these less practical medium types.\n\nIn a recent online study with photo and video lineups, Seale-Carlisle and Mickes (2016) deliberately confounded the comparison to explore differences between U.S. and U.K. procedures. In the U.K. procedure, nine videos depicting lineup members turning from left to right were presented sequentially. All videos were recorded by a U.K. police officer and adhered to PACE specifications, meaning each lasted 15 s. Also consistent with PACE, the lineup was shown twice before participants could respond (presentation duration depended on Internet connection speed; average = 6 min). In the U.S. procedure, six front-view still images were presented simultaneously and participants could respond immediately. Compared to those who received the U.K. procedure, participants who received the U.S. procedure were more likely to correctly identify the target if present (39% vs. 20%, OR = 2.56, 95% CI [1.96, 3.34]) and also more likely to correctly reject the lineup if the target was absent (45% vs. 30%, OR = 1.91, 95% CI [1.48, 2.46]). Seale-Carlisle and Mickes acknowledged that the many differences between the two procedures precluded causal explanations of the U.S. advantage, but pointed to two possibilities: (a) U.K. lineups were presented sequentially and (b) participants in the U.K. condition may have lost attention during the lineup presentation. We find the second explanation more compelling than the first.\n\nIt seems unlikely that simultaneous presentation alone would cause such a robust advantage for the U.S. condition. Sequential presentation is known to reduce choosing, which, compared to simultaneous presentation, tends to correspond with a reduction in correct identifications in target-present lineups and an increase in correct rejections of target-absent lineups (Clark, 2012; Palmer & Brewer, 2012). But the data reported by Seale-Carlisle and Mickes (2016) do not fit the typical pattern: collapsed across target-presence, choosing in the U.K. sequential condition was higher than in the U.S. simultaneous condition (70% vs. 62%, OR = 1.42, 95% CI [1.19, 1.69]).\n\nThe duration of the U.K. lineup procedure, combined with the use of online data collection, seems like a more plausible explanation for the poor outcomes in the U.K. condition. Seale-Carlisle and Mickes (2016) collected their data from undergraduate students, who have been reported to be less attentive than other populations in online studies (Hauser & Schwarz, 2016). Online and lab data collection has led to similar results in one previous comparison between simultaneous and sequential lineups (Mickes, Flowe, & Wixted, 2012). Note, however, in that experiment participants in both conditions could make a decision as soon as a stimulus was presented. In Seale-Carlisle and Mickes’s experiment, participants in the U.S. condition were able to respond to the lineup immediately, whereas participants in the U.K. condition were forced to view the entire lineup twice before they could respond. There is a sensible justification for this discrepancy: PACE guidelines require witnesses to view the entire lineup twice before making a decision and we know of no US guidelines with an equivalent requirement. Nevertheless, the length of the U.K. lineup procedure in this study (reportedly, ∼6 mins) may have been too long for undergraduate students to attend to the videos in an unsupervised environment. The question at hand is whether attention would be similarly lost by witnesses in real cases who (a) would have an incentive to identify the culprit and (b) would observe the videos under the supervision of a lineup administrator.\n\nWe suspect that at the very least, real U.K. lineups would not perform as poorly as the online U.K. lineups. Take, for example, the dismal correct identification rate of 20% for the U.K. online lineup (Seale-Carlisle & Mickes, 2016). This is substantially lower than suspect identification rates in field observations with real witnesses in the United Kingdom, which tend to hover around 40% (Horry, Memon, Wright, & Milne, 2012; Memon, Havard, Clifford, Gabbert, & Watt, 2011; Pike, Brace, & Kynan, 2002). Suspect identifications in real cases are not directly comparable to correct identifications in experiments because, among other reasons, the suspect’s guilt is only known in the latter. But if suspect identifications in the United Kingdom have any diagnostic value, the rate for guilty suspect identifications alone would be higher than the rate that aggregates guilty and innocent suspect identifications. The rejection rates in the online experiment are also worth noting: Participants were just as likely to incorrectly reject a U.K. target-present lineup (30%) as they were to correctly reject a U.K. target-absent lineup (30%). This seems consistent with the suggestion that the online participants were not paying sufficient attention while the U.K. lineup was presented and underscores the need for additional research to determine whether the attentional demands of the U.K. video lineup would cause similar problems when a lineup administrator is present to supervise the witness.\n\nWhen administered in the laboratory, comparisons between U.K. video lineups and photo equivalents have yielded mixed results (see ). Valentine et al. (2007) found a significant advantage in correct rejections of target-absent lineups for moving relative to static images, OR = 3.94, 95% CI [1.17, 13.27], and also found a smaller nonsignificant increase in correct identifications from target-present lineups favoring moving images, OR = 1.53, 95% CI [0.71, 3.32]. Darling et al. (2008) also found a trend favoring correct rejections of moving over still images in lineups with fillers matched to the culprit’s description, OR = 3.70, 95% CI [0.85, 16.67], but in lineups with fillers matched to the suspect’s appearance the trend in correct rejections was in the opposite direction (i.e., favoring still images), OR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.33, 4.51], and correct identifications in target-present lineups trended higher for still images regardless of how fillers were selected, OR = 1.41, 95% CI [0.57, 3.53]. In a study with child witnesses, Beresford and Blades (2006) found no consistent advantage favoring photo or video lineups. Havard et al. (2010), who also tested children, found general trends favoring video when the target was present and photo when the target was absent (and these trends were even further complicated by developmental differences). None of these experiments provides conclusive evidence of a superior medium.\n\nTable 3\n\nTarget, outcome, and studyEventConditionPhotoU.K. videoEffect size and CIsTest of nullRateTypenRateTypenORLLULzp\n\nNote.

In one of the earliest tests, participants who observed a live event identified the culprit from photo and video lineups at comparable rates, which were uniformly high—92% and 95%, respectively—and indicative of a ceiling effect (Shepherd et al., 1982). Another null result was reported by Cutler, Penrod, O’Rourke, and Martens (1986), who found no benefit of supplementing a photo lineup with videos that depicted the lineup members walking in and out of a room, OR = 1.06, 95% CI [0.67, 1.67]. Kerstholt et al. (2004) found a trend in correct identifications favoring photo lineups, OR = 1.80, 95% CI [0.73, 4.42], but also found a trend in correct rejections favoring video lineups, OR = 1.56, 95% CI [0.66, 3.70].\n\nContrary the lackluster results discussed so far, a few experiments have suggested an edge for video lineups. In addition to the previously mentioned experiment in which video lineups yielded an increase in correct rejections of target-absent lineups with no associated cost in target-present lineups (Valentine et al., 2007), our literature review led us to three additional experiments with results that favored video over photo lineups. In perhaps the first comparison between photo and video lineups, participants viewed a video containing a target person and then provided confidence ratings for lineup members presented as monochromatic photos, color photos, or monochromatic videos (Sussman, Sugarman, & Zavala, 1972). Of the monochromatic conditions, those who saw videos significantly outperformed those who saw photos, d = 1.08 (0.23, 1.94), OR = 7.09 (1.50, 33.55). Participants also performed better in the monochromatic video condition than in the color photo condition, though this difference was not significant, d = 0.70 (−0.12, 1.52), OR = 3.55 (0.80, 15.88). In another early experiment, Schiff, Banka, and de Bordes Galdi (1986) compared photo and video lineups that each contained 6 targets and 12 fillers. The video lineups, which displayed the lineup members turning in a rotating chair, led to greater discriminability compared with the photo lineups, d = 0.61 (0.09, 1.13), OR = 3.02 (1.18, 7.73), an effect that was larger when targets were encoded in a video event (video lineup d′ = 1.59, photo lineup d′ = 0.73) than in a slideshow event (video lineup d′ = 2.38, photo lineup d′ = 2.02). In a more conventional implementation of video and photo lineups, Cutler and Fisher (1990) reported a large, albeit nonsignificant, increase in correct rejections of target-absent lineups in a condition with videos that portrayed the members walking and talking (81%) compared with a photo condition that included an image of the full simultaneous lineup and individual close-ups of each lineup member (57%), d = 0.63 (−0.09, 1.35), OR = 3.15 (0.86, 11.60). The advantage in correct rejections came at no cost to correct identifications in the target-present lineups, which were trivially higher in the video condition (31% vs. 29%), d = 0.04 (−0.71, 0.62), OR = 1.11 (0.32, 3.92). One caveat in Cutler and Fisher’s experiment, however, is that the target-present and target-absent lineups contained different people and were not counterbalanced (Clark et al., 2015). Each of these three experiments also had small samples.\n\nIn our review of empirical comparisons between photo and video lineups, we found some indicators of a benefit for video lineups, but such experiments were exceptions rather than the rule. Further, none of the experiments favoring video lineups had the sample size needed for confidence in the findings. The only experiment with an impressive sample size favored the U.S. lineup condition, which used photos, but confounding factors obscure the cause of this advantage (Seale-Carlisle & Mickes, 2016). In sum, the empirical literature provides no compelling evidence in favor of either photo or video lineups.\n\nIs Live Identification Inherently Superior to Photo and Video identification?\n\nThere are intuitive reasons to believe that, all else equal, live presentation would be the best method to facilitate an accurate eyewitness identification. Live lineups can elicit cues of height, weight, voice, and motion not typically available in photo and video lineups (Clark et al., 2015). At a live identification procedure, lineup members appear in their entirety and can be asked to walk, to talk, or to make facial expressions. Requests to act out a behavior may not always be met with compliance, and in many cases the types of cues possible only at a live procedure would be superfluous for identification. Still, it seems reasonable to predict that the additional information conveyed in a live lineup would help some witnesses identify the culprit. Those familiar with the organization and administration of a live lineup may counter that the logistical constraints of live procedures would negate any benefits afforded by the availability of additional cues. This is a point to which we will return. But in this section we set practicalities aside and consider the theoretical basis of the live superiority hypothesis.\n\nIf a crime has been witnessed live, benefits may come from an identification procedure that is also administered live. When the cognitive processes at encoding and retrieval overlap, transfer appropriate processing is theorized to occur (Morris, Bransford, & Franks, 1977). From this perspective, the processes engaged while witnessing a live event would be more likely to be reengaged at a live lineup than at a photo or video lineup. Matching the test medium with the event medium would also conform to the encoding specificity principle (Tulving & Thomson, 1973), which emphasizes the correspondence between the encoding and retrieval contexts. Study-test congruency effects in recognition of pictures and faces lend empirical support for these theoretical accounts (Buratto, Matthews, & Lamberts, 2009; Goldstein, Chance, Hoisington, & Buescher, 1982; Lander & Davies, 2007). Live lineups could increase the availability of cues and, in turn, the likelihood of retrieving the encoded details. Simply put, identification success should be enhanced by the availability of encoded details at test.\n\nThe availability of dynamic cues, in particular, may increase through live presentation of the lineup members. At a live criminal event, witnesses can encode dynamic motions from the perpetrator (e.g., facial expressions). Contrary to invariant structures (e.g., ethnicity), which are stable, dynamic motions are subject to change and less reliable as cues to recognition. The supplemental information hypothesis proposes that although recognition via invariant structures is generally preferred, dynamic motions can facilitate recognition when invariant structures are deemed uninformative (O’Toole, Roark, & Abdi, 2002). Thus, if all the lineup members possess the invariant structures that were encoded, the witness may benefit from the presence of dynamic motion cues. The value of such cues would be heightened for witnesses who have encoded a dynamic identity signature (Lander et al., 1999; Yovel & O’Toole, 2016); that is, movements that are idiosyncratic to the perpetrator. Although a relatively prolonged exposure to the target may be needed to detect and encode movements that are diagnostic to the target’s identity (Butcher & Lander, 2017; O’Toole et al., 2002), increasing familiarity at encoding does not always increase the benefits of movement at retrieval (Lander & Davies, 2007), which suggests rapid extraction of dynamic identity signatures may be possible.\n\nAnother potential benefit of live lineups is that the lineup members’ bodies are normally in view, whereas in photo and video lineups usually only the head and shoulders are visible. The most reliable cues for person identification are typically, but not always, located above the shoulders. Person-matching research indicates that removing the body from view leads to only a small decrease in identification accuracy, whereas removing the face causes a substantial decline in performance (e.g., Burton, Wilson, Cowan, & Bruce, 1999). Nevertheless, bodies with no face in view can be matched (e.g., O’Toole et al., 2011; Robbins & Coltheart, 2012) and recognized (Hahn, O’Toole, & Phillips, 2016) at levels well over chance expectancy. Further, when trying to match two images of people with similar faces and dissimilar bodies, matching whole-person or body-only images can be easier than matching faces (Rice, Phillips, Natu, An, & O’Toole, 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest supplementing face cues with information from the body could improve lineup identification accuracy.\n\nAlthough the points discussed in this section may provide ammunition for believers in the live superiority hypothesis, we nevertheless remain skeptical of its application to lineups in practice. In addition to the absence of experimental data in support of live lineup superiority, there have been few experimental tests even on the broader issue of live identification superiority. The benefits of dynamic cues and whole-body views have been tested almost exclusively with videos and photos, which leads us to the more fundamental question of whether live testing is required to reap the theorized benefits we have discussed. If viewing the bodies of lineup members were found to improve lineup identifications, this would not provide direct support for the live superiority hypothesis. Whole person views tend to be available in live lineups and head-and-shoulder views tend to be available in photo and video lineups; however this is a convention, not a necessity. There is nothing inherent about photo or video lineups that would preclude whole person views. Although dynamic cues are not possible in photo lineups, they are certainly possible in video lineups. Indeed, the standard experimental approach to test for benefits of dynamic cues has been through comparing static photos and dynamic videos (Yovel & O’Toole, 2016). Thus, even when issues of fairness or practicality are not considered, the live superiority hypothesis has few legs to stand on. And when these factors are taken into account, the case for live lineups over other procedures falls apart.\n\nAre Live Lineups Fairer Than Video and Photo Lineups?\n\nLive lineups have been frequently cited as the fairest identification procedure. Influential court cases and legal reviews have questioned the fairness of photo identifications on three grounds (Alexander v. The Queen, 1981; Brooks, 1983; Devlin, 1976): (a) the right to observe: a photo identification procedure denies the suspect of the opportunity to monitor the conditions of the identification procedure; (b) the rogues’ gallery effect: a photo identification procedure implies that the lineup members have criminal records; and (c) transference of familiarity: photo identifications interfere with subsequent identifications from live lineups. Contrary to these suggestions, we believe that photo and video lineups are at minimum as fair as live lineups (and more likely, fairer). Below, we explain why we do not consider these arguments compelling and argue that numerous characteristics of live lineups make them difficult to conduct fairly.\n\nAt first glance, the right to observe argument has intuitive appeal. A suspect who is present for the identification could conceivably make note of, or even prevent, elements of the procedure that could bias how the witness responds. This logic rings particularly true if the procedure is overtly biased; for example, a lineup with a suspect of different ethnic origin than that of the fillers. In this situation, most suspects would at least be aware that something is not right. A suspect would also be able to make decisions if present that would be more difficult or even impossible if absent. For instance, in many jurisdictions the suspect is permitted to choose their position in the lineup. Position effects have been demonstrated empirically (Clark & Davey, 2005; Palmer, Sauer, & Holt, 2017) and if the suspect’s position were left up to the administrators, one might question whether the position assigned to the suspect was fairly chosen. But is a suspect only able to observe if the lineup is administered live?\n\nIn certain jurisdictions and under certain conditions, the medium used to present a lineup has direct implications on the suspect’s ability to observe. In the United States, following a Supreme Court decision (United States v. Ash, 1973), suspects have no right to counsel at photo lineups. In a previous decision (United States v. Wade, 1967), out of concern for the risk of suggestion, the suspect’s right to counsel while participating in a live lineup had been established. But it was decided in Ash that this right does not extend to photo lineups. The distinction was justified on the grounds that legal representation is intended to protect suspects from disadvantages stemming from their lack of familiarity with the law or their inability to defend themselves against a professional prosecutor. Because the suspect is not present at photo lineups, these disadvantages were perceived as inapplicable. Although the majority opinion in Ash acknowledged that suggestion in photo lineups was still possible, it was considered far less likely than in a live lineup. And if suggestion did occur, it was argued that the suggestive element could be reconstructed at trial.\n\nThe dissenting justices argued that suggestion could just as easily occur during a photo lineup, an opinion now supported by empirical evidence (Clark, Brower, Rosenthal, Hicks, & Moreland, 2013; Greathouse & Kovera, 2009), but since Ash, photo lineups have been routinely administered in the U.S. without even informing the suspect or the suspect’s representative that the identification procedure has taken place. At a live procedure, the suspect is inherently present and one might reasonably expect the suspect’s legal representation also to be present. But the right to counsel at a live lineup in the US only applies if the suspect has been formally charged (United States v. Wade, 1967) and in practice only 11% of U.S. police agencies report taking measures to arrange for the suspect to have legal representation at all live lineup proceedings (PERF, 2013).\n\nIf the aim were to ensure the suspect has representation at the lineup, recommending that lineups be administered live seems a roundabout way of achieving it. Why not simply advise that suspects should have representation present during any lineup procedure? Identification procedures in England and Wales have been normally administered in the presence of the suspect’s solicitor not because of the lineup medium, but rather because Code D guidelines required it.3 The notion that the lineup medium influences the presence of counsel simply does not reflect the facts on the ground.\n\nLive lineups do not ensure the critical aspects of the testing conditions will be observed. The only meaningful difference between lineup medium types from a right to observe standpoint is that the suspect is present at a live lineup. However, witnesses are commonly permitted to make the identification from behind a one-way screen. And even if the suspect is able to observe the identification, it would be naïve to expect a nonexpert to know about and detect the myriad of factors that could compromise the procedure. From our perspective, the right to observe would be best served by video-recording the lineup procedure—whatever the medium—and preserving the conduct of the identification proceeding (see also Kassin, 1998; Sporer, 1993; Winmar v. The State of Western Australia, 2007). Although recording all lineups may not have been feasible at the time when the right to observe was first argued, this is now less of an issue thanks to the widespread availability and reduced cost of video equipment.\n\nThe rogues’ gallery effect is another idea that may have been a legitimate concern in the past, but seems no longer relevant in the digital age. Rogues gallery presumes that if witnesses know that police possess a photograph of the suspect, they will infer that the suspect has a criminal record. But photographs can now be obtained in a variety of ways. Mugshots are still used in U.S. photo lineups, but so are driver’s license photographs (PERF, 2013). More to the point, it would not seem outlandish that the police would ask a suspect who has no criminal record to be photographed. In Winmar, the Supreme Court of Western Australia acknowledged the possibility of undue prejudice many years ago when witnesses were shown mugshots of prisoners with inmate numbers in view, but pointed out that with modern technology mugshots can be altered to remove such incriminating characteristics. Put simply, the rogues’ gallery can be avoided with easily implemented safeguards and the use of photographs in itself need not imply that the lineup members have criminal pasts.\n\nThe last of the three arguments rests on the assumption that live identifications are inherently superior to photo identifications. Transference of familiarity, which occurs when the memory of a person identified at a photo identification procedure replaces the memory of the criminal observed at the witnessed event, is a legitimate concern associated with repeated identification procedures (Steblay, Tix, & Benson, 2013). Not much is gained from a live lineup if a photo identification has already been conducted because at the second lineup it is never clear whether the suspect was remembered from the witnessed event or from the first lineup. If live identifications were more reliable than photo identifications, there could be an argument against administering a photo lineup because it would taint the witness’s memory and ruin the opportunity to obtain evidence via the more reliable, live procedure. Here lies the problem: the reliability of live over photo identification has not been established. Without clear evidence of live superiority, transference of familiarity has no relevance to the question of whether photo lineups are a suitable alternative to live lineups.\n\nHaving addressed the three main criticisms of nonlive procedures, it is worth taking a moment to consider what makes a lineup fair. We believe that a fair lineup procedure should minimize or ideally eliminate the opportunity for the witness to determine the suspect’s identity without relying on recognition memory. Lineups are a recognition task designed to enable witnesses to share information beyond what they have already stated in their verbal accounts. If something about the behaviors of the lineup members or the structure of the lineup provide a nonmemorial route to identification of the suspect, the lineup would be considered unfair. With this operational definition guiding our judgment of fairness, we contend that, if anything, photo and video lineups should normally be fairer than live lineups.\n\nA central concern about the fairness of live lineups is that suspects are likely to emit cues and, contrary to nonlive procedures, there is no opportunity for a second take to prevent the witness from observing these cues. Suspects are likely to be anxious during a lineup procedure and research suggests they have difficulty hiding this from observers. In one study, participants judged the suspect to be the most anxious, most insecure, and most helpless-looking member of the lineup; further, another group of participants instructed to pick the suspect were successful far more often than would be expected by chance despite not having witnessed the crime (Fabian, Stadler, & Wetzels, 1996). The generalizability of these results may have been limited by the fact that all the fillers in the lineup were police officers; but in experimental research (Weigold & Wentura, 2004), even people who have not committed a crime are more likely to be identified if they were told they were the suspect (and were incentivized to avoid being selected) than if they were told they were a filler (with no such incentive). Further, to assist with lineup identifications, witnesses may rely on the lineup members’ emotional state or their appearance of guilt (Flowe & Humphries, 2011; Flowe, Klatt, & Colloff, 2014).\n\nEven if the suspect is able to effectively monitor and control their behavior, their identity may be revealed by cues emitted from the fillers. At a live identification proceeding, fillers commonly know the identity of the suspect. All it would take is for the fillers to be waiting in one room before the identification procedure and for the suspect to be waiting in another. The only way to avoid this would be to have a separate room for each member of the lineup, which is not always possible (Pike et al., 2002). Further, if more than one witness is involved, lineup administrators may need to offer suspects the opportunity to change their position in the lineup prior to each witness identification (Home Office, 2017). Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that fillers in live lineups will often be (a) aware of the suspect’s identity and (b) able to communicate cues to the suspect’s identity. Examples of filler behaviors that could implicate the suspect include glancing at the suspect or standing farther away from the suspect than from the other lineup members.\n\nWith video and photo lineups, lineup administrators have greater control over the behaviors of suspects and fillers. If a filler or suspect emits a cue during a live lineup, there are limitations in what can be done to minimize the cue’s influence on the identification decision. Much as an obscenity heard during a live TV broadcast cannot be unheard, a hint to the suspect’s identity during a live lineup cannot be unseen. Although these types of cues are also possible with photo or live lineups, the person producing the image has the opportunity to ask the lineup member to try it again.\n\nThe risk of the administrator leaking cues to the eyewitness may also be heighted at a live lineup because simple methods of reducing administrator influence like computer-based administration are more difficult than with photo or video lineups. To prevent the possibility of influence on the witness (even unintentional), there have long been calls for lineups to be administered by someone who is blind to the suspect’s identity (Wells, 1988). Computer administration can reduce the possibility of influence even further by minimizing the social interaction between the administrator and witness or, in the case of self-administration, eliminating interaction altogether while the images are in view (Brewer, 2011; Kovera & Evelo, 2017).\n\nThe flexibility of live lineups could also lead to unanticipated situations with implications for fairness. At a live lineup in England and Wales, for example, Code D stipulates that if a witness requests to hear the lineup members speak, the administrator should first advise the witness to make a visual identification if possible; however, if the witness continues to request information about voice, the administrator can ask the lineup members to speak. In some cases, auditory cues may facilitate accurate identifications (Melara, DeWitt-Rickards, & O’Brien, 1989) and, indeed, some scholars have proposed including voice cues in lineups to supplement information from the face (Levi & Lindsay, 2001). But permitting the lineup members to speak without taking precautionary measures in advance could present a serious risk to a procedure’s fairness. For example, a suspect with a distinctive accent not shared by the other lineup members would stand out if they were all asked to speak (Wells, 2001).\n\nThe suitability of fillers is central to the fairness of a lineup. Although common practice in the field is to select fillers who resemble the suspect in physical appearance (Home Office, 2017; PERF, 2013), researchers have proposed that a fair lineup comprises members who all match the witness description of the culprit (Luus & Wells, 1991; Wells, Rydell, & Seelau, 1993). If a lineup member does not contain a feature from the description, a witness could eliminate this person because they do not correspond with what they recalled at the time of the description. But if all the lineup members possess each of the features from the description, the witness is forced to go beyond the information about the culprit they already provided and rely on recognition memory to make the identification. If a witness gives a very detailed description or the goal is to find fillers who closely match the suspect’s appearance, it could be difficult to find people who have each of the features in short notice for a live lineup. Constructing a lineup with implausible fillers has the effect of increasing suspect identifications, regardless of whether the suspect is guilty or innocent (Clark & Godfrey, 2009; Fitzgerald, Price, Oriet, & Charman, 2013; Flowe & Ebbesen, 2007; Lindsay & Wells, 1980). Whether trying to match fillers to the witness description or to the suspect’s appearance, the objective would be more easily met by selecting images from an electronic database than by recruiting locally for a live procedure.\n\nAttempts to quantify lineup fairness have tended to favor nonlive over live lineups. Filler quality can be empirically tested using a mock-witness paradigm (Doob & Kirshenbaum, 1973). Although variations of the procedure have been developed (Mansour, Beaudry, Kalmet, Bertrand, & Lindsay, 2017), the standard practice is to provide a description of the culprit to participants who did not observe the crime and then to instruct these nonwitnesses to choose the lineup member most likely to be the suspect. If all lineup members match the description, the suspect should be chosen no more than expected by chance. In one application of this paradigm with real U.K. lineups (Valentine & Heaton, 1999), the suspect identification rate for live lineups (25%) was more than double chance expectancy (11%) and significantly greater than the suspect identification rate for video lineups (15%), which was higher, but not significantly higher, than chance expectancy (11%). In a subsequent study (Valentine, Harris, Piera, & Darling, 2003), fairness of U.K. video lineups was unaffected by whether the suspect was of White European or African Caribbean ethnicity. This was seen as a benefit because African Caribbean fillers were reportedly more difficult to recruit than White-European fillers for live lineups."
