        "text": "Last year’s new theme for the CBS Evening News became a fan favorite the minute it debuted. It’s a reworking of the classic Trivers/Myers theme that CBS has used at various points since the late eighties. This version is produced by the NYC-based music production company Antfood. You can now listen to the full version on this website.\n\nAntfood is also responsible for the sound of CBS Mornings. The original Eye Opener at 7 (which was replaced by the previous theme after a month) and the Eye Opener at 8 have been added. Both prominently contain the “This is CBS”-mnemonic.\n\nThe current Today Show open used for the 7 a.m. hour, has also been added. The previous version I had on here was slightly longer and different from the mix used on air. I’ve left the other one for you to enjoy as well. Also some older NBC News promo’s have been added that were produced by 615 Music: We’re Everywhere, There’s More Today Everyday, Why I Love Today, Your Day is Today.\n\nFinally, a reader came across this interview with legendary composer John Williams from 1985. It’s one of the few not focused on his movie scores but on his work for NBC News. He talks about why he considers writing music for news daunting (“you can’t make it louder”) and if he considered incorporating the NBC chimes. Well worth five minutes of your time.\n\nOn Monday, March 13th, NBC News Now launched a new show, Stay Tuned Now with Gadi Schwartz. It’s the rare national primetime news show based in Los Angeles, airing daily on NBC News’ digital channel. It’s an extension of NBC News’ mobile-first, Gen Z news brand, Stay Tuned. The theme is composed by Matthew Sikora and Elizabeth Forde alongside creative direction by the production team, as well as Current Music’s Producer/Composer, Maddie Madsen. This is the third theme that Current Music has produced for NBC News Now.\n\nNBC News Now has really developed its own identity. Their presentation style is a lot more laid back. Anchor Hallie Jackson regularly wears sneakers for example. The writing is very conversational. The graphics are bright and colorful. And the theme music is very high energy, incorporating lots of pop elements that aren’t traditionally associated with news music. For the Stay Tuned Now theme, anchor Gadi Schwartz suggested incorporating breakbeats.\n\nI’m excited to launch a complete redesign of Network News Music! The site has been online for 21 years and has had the same basic layout for the past ten. But trends in web design have changed radically in that time. With a fresh new look, there is more room for pictures. And text is easier to read thanks to a larger font and more white space. I’ll be tweaking some things in the weeks and probably months to come, as I am not yet completely satisfied. Feel free to let me know what you like or dislike.\n\nOf course new music has also been added. The new theme for CBS Mornings by Antfood has been added, both the weekday and Saturday editions. It incorporates the Sunday Morning theme, Abblasen, thereby (again) connecting the weekday show to the beloved Sunday edition.\n\nPast incarnations\n\nThanks to my friend Terry Wilkie from the Museum of Television Production Music I am able to add themes from past incarnations of CBS’s morning show. The theme from the short-lived 1987 Morning Program, the first CBS This Morning theme from 1987 and an additional track from CBS This Morning’s 1996 theme by the late Peter Fish.\n\nSome other recognizable themes have also been added to the archive. The new CBS News Special Report theme, the opening that Good Morning America used from 2000 to 2003 by NJJ Music, the Face the Nation theme from 2015 after Bob Schieffer left, the NBC News at Sunrise theme from 1983 and Shelly Palmer’s theme for The News with Brian Williams, shown on MSNBC starting in 1996. As always, thanks for stopping by!"
