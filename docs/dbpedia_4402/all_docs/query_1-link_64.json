        "text": "Matt Murray plays Tony Michaels, a small-town cop with big-time dreams, in USA Network’s bone-chilling new original drama series Eyewitness. Murray stars as Brian on the Netflix comedy series Kevin from Work, which debuted on Freeform, and recently shot a lead role opposite Jason Lee and Alyssa Milano in the CBS comedy pilot What Goes Around Comes Around. Previously, Murray starred for two seasons as Duncan Moore on ABC’s hit drama series Rookie Blue. He can next be seen on CBS’ fan-favorite series Life In Pieces. Additionally, Murray recurred on the CW series LA Complex and Bite TV’s Guidance, and has appeared on NBC’s The Firm and USA Network’s Suits. A Detroit native, Murray moved to Toronto after graduating high school to pursue acting. He received a degree in Theatre Performance from the esteemed Humber School of Creative Arts and was subsequently accepted to the prestigious Canadian Film Centre Actors Conservatory, a program that selects only eight actors from across Canada per year."
