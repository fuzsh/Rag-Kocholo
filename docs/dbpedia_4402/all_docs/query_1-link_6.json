        "meta_description": "Teenager Lukas Hallenbeck seemingly has it all -- popularity, motocross stardom and an attractive girlfriend -- but deep down is conflicted about his sexuality. Those feelings begin to come to the surface when he meets Philip, a classmate with whom he starts a relationship that the boys try to keep secret. Things get more complicated when the teens witness a murder and fear that they will be found by the person who committed the crime. While they stay silent about what they saw, they realize that it can never be unseen and the traumatic event has changed their lives forever. As he is potentially being hunted by the killer, Lukas worries that his secret will be revealed, he will be outed, and he will lose everything. \"Eyewitness\" is an adaptation of a Norwegian crime thriller.",
