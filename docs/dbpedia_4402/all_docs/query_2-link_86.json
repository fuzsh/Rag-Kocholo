        "text": "Wednesday 14 August\n\nBad Monkey\n\nApple TV+\n\nIn sunny, eccentric Florida, an amateur fisherman pulls the severed arm of a man from the ocean. It is not just any severed arm either, but one with its middle finger stuck in the offending position. It is a fittingly punchy opening for this breezy 10-part comedy, which stars Vince Vaughn as a suspended Miami cop – the irreverent maverick Andrew Yancy – who is trying to get his job back. If you are familiar with Vaughn’s movies (Wedding Crashers, Old School, Dodgeball et al) you’ll know the type: the wisecracking womaniser with a heart of gold and a penchant for filling his annoying neighbour’s house with bees.\n\nYancy sees the mysterious arm as his chance to redeem himself. Little does he know, however, that the case will suck him into a conspiracy involving the building of a new beachside resort in the Bahamas. This is where we meet Neville (Ronald Peet), a disgruntled local who owns the titular monkey. The opening two episodes, premiering today, flick between these two threads with panache. This is helped by the smooth voice-over of Captain Fitzpatrick (Tom Nowicki), owner of the boat whose men found the arm, who tells the story like he’s drinking a cold beer on a hot day. SK\n\nDaughters\n\nNetflix\n\nThis lyrical feature-length documentary follows the build-up to the Daddy Daughter Dance, a US prison programme that gives incarcerated fathers a rare chance to bond with their children. It is an intimate portrait of the emotional toll of absent parents – both for the daughters, who are wise beyond their years, and the inmates themselves.\n\nThe Big Brunch\n\nU&W, 8pm\n\nDan Levy, best known as the star of US sitcom Schitt’s Creek, presents this big hearted eight-part cooking show. The format is essentially MasterChef: 10 talented cooks are tasked with creating a brunch-themed starter and main dish. The difference is tone, which feels inspired by the gentleness of The Great British Bake Off.\n\nCelebrity Race Across the World\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nThe celebrity edition of the race returns. This year’s globetrotters are broadcaster Kelly Brook and her husband Jeremy; Ted Lasso actor Kola Bokinni and his cousin Mary; radio host Scott Mills and his husband Sam; and presenter Jeff Brazier and his son Freddie. Tonight they find themselves in Brazil, where they must start their epic 12,500 km journey to the Andes.\n\nIrvine Welsh’s Crime\n\nITV1, 9pm; Wales, 10.45pm\n\n“I put my hand through the powdered skull of a dead child!” sobs Dougray Scott’s tortured DI Lennox tonight. The highlight of this week’s episode of the tense crime drama, however, is Derek Riddell’s deliciously hateful politician Richie Gulliver. The series continues tomorrow.\n\nKidnapped: The Chloe Ayling Story\n\nBBC Three, from 9pm\n\nIn 2017, a glamour model called Chloe Ayling was kidnapped in Milan and held for ransom. This intriguing six-part drama outlines the ordeal and its aftermath, which saw Ayling (Nadia Parkes) falsely accused of making it up. The first two episodes premiere tonight and also air tomorrow on BBC One; all six are on iPlayer.\n\nRemember… Inspector Lynley Mysteries\n\nBBC Four, 10pm\n\nLead actors Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small reflect on their 2001 drama, which smashed together two detectives from opposing backgrounds. It’s followed by the first two episodes: the meeting of DI Thomas Linley, 8th Earl of Asherton, and working-class Detective Sgt Barbara Havers.\n\nBoyz N the Hood (1991) ★★★★★\n\nGreat! Movies, 9pm\n\nJohn Singleton’s debut film, made when he was just 24-years-old, is a searing wake-up call about friends growing up on the rough streets of Los Angeles. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Laurence Fishburne, it blazed the trail for black directors in the early 1990s, thanks to its cautionary rhetoric about gang culture, the scourge of inescapable poverty and magnetic performances (especially from rapper Ice Cube as surly layabout Doughboy).\n\nBridge of Spies (2015) ★★★★★\n\nBBC One, 11.20pm\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Cold War thriller swirls with intrigue; its tension is worthy of the best of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic noir films. Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a US lawyer recruited by the CIA to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in a role that deservedly won him both a Bafta and an Oscar) and arranges to trade him for a captured US pilot in East Berlin. Amy Ryan and Alan Alda also stalk through the fog.\n\nMeet the Parents (2000) ★★★★\n\nFilm4, 11.20pm\n\nJay Roach’s oh-so-Noughties romantic comedy may be silly, but it’s elevated by terrific, understated performances from Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. The former is Jack Byrnes, an uptight ex-CIA agent deeply suspicious of his daughter’s new boyfriend, the eager-to-please but accident-prone Greg Focker (played with winning charm by Stiller). The equally hilarious sequel, Meet the Fockers, is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThursday 15 August\n\nWho Do You Think You Are?\n\nBBC One, 9pm\n\nFar from the complicated, ferocious characters that she portrays on television, actress Vicky McClure is the definition of level-headed, down to earth and rooted; she even still lives just a few minutes from her parents and extended family in Nottingham, where she grew up. But with a grandmother who was abandoned at birth and a great-grandfather who died at the hands of the Japanese during the Second World War, she makes a perfect subject for the first episode in this new run of the engrossing celebrity genealogy show (other personalities to come include Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill, actress and Strictly winner Rose Ayling-Ellis and former Spice Girl Mel C).\n\nWhile McClure’s grandmother Jean’s story is a sad one, it yields few surprises, so we move quickly on to the trials of her great-grandfather, Harry, who worked as a miner before joining up during the war, where he fought the Japanese in Singapore before being captured and sent to Taiwan as a prisoner of war. Of course, McClure heads there, too, to hear of the horrifying conditions that Harry had to endure as a forced labourer in a copper mine, and the circumstances in which he met his end. A moving testament to sacrifice. GO\n\nEmily in Paris\n\nNetflix\n\nWhatever else you may think about it, the clothes and setting remain fabulous as the much-anticipated fourth season of the love-it/hate-it series about an American PR (played by Lily Collins) frollicking around Paris finally arrives. Expect quite a few refreshes in personnel – and love interests – this time out.\n\nStags\n\nParamount+\n\nThis raucous six-part dramedy follows Stu (Nico Mirallegro) and his eight variously numpty/smart British pals (among them Charlie Cooper and Asim Chaudhry) on a stag-do trip to South America that goes very, very wrong. In the first episode, they’re banged up in a hellhole island prison run by feuding criminal siblings; think The Hangover, but with much higher stakes.\n\nThe Bureau\n\nParamount+\n\nCould this be the next Spiral? The grittily atmospheric spy series revolving around the lives of France’s version of MI6, the DGSE external security agency, was so well received at home in France that it ran for five seasons and won awards for acting, writing and direction. All 50 episodes are available from today.\n\nClassic Movies: The Story of Whisky Galore!\n\nSky Arts, 8pm\n\nFilm journalist Ian Nathan explores the true story that inspired Alexander Mackendrick’s glorious 1949 Ealing wartime romp about a Scottish island community whose fortunes turn when a freighter carrying 50,000 crates of whisky is shipwrecked on its shores.\n\nDaddy Issues\n\nBBC Three, 9pm & 9.25pm\n\nActor David Morrissey may be a familiar face in serious drama, but he is wonderfully funny in this Stockport-based six-part comedy opposite the equally brilliant Aimee Lou Wood (Sex Education). They play divorced dad Malcolm and his pregnant daughter Gemma, forced to move in together to save cash. Also airing on BBC One from tomorrow.\n\nKlitschko: More Than a Fight\n\nSky Documentaries, 9pm\n\nAfter President Zelensky, the heavyweight-boxer brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are probably the best-known Ukrainians leading the fight against Putin’s invading Russian forces. This dual profile by Oscar-winner Kevin Macdonald focuses marginally more on former World Champion Vitali in his role as mayor of the capital, Kyiv.\n\nBridge to Terabithia (2007) ★★★\n\nFilm4, 12.40pm\n\nAnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson (who went on to star together in The Hunger Games) play two young misfits who become friends and create a magical world of the imagination in a remote part of the forest. This quality Disney production, adapted from Katherine Paterson’s wondrous 1977 novel, ventures into unexpectedly dark territory, and manages to carry some genuine emotional freight.\n\nDial M for Murder (1954, b/w) ★★★★\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nIt’s not quite as brilliant as Hitchcock’s best (Vertigo, The Birds), but his spin on Frederick Knott’s stage play is still packed with suspense. Tony Wendice (played by the superbly sinister Ray Milland) is trying to have his wife (Grace Kelly) murdered. When his first plan fails, he dreams up another that’s even more devious. If you’re in the mood for more Hitchcock, 1941 noir Suspicion follows.\n\nLucy (2014) ★★★★\n\nITV4, 10.10pm\n\nScarlett Johansson stars in this excellent Luc Besson thriller as Lucy, a woman whose drug-addled brain begins to surpass our usual (reputed) 10 per cent level of grey-matter use; but take the “science” with a lump of salt and just enjoy Johansson’s riveting, icy performance. Morgan Freeman plays the neuroscientist tasked with explaining the mind’s power. What happens at 100 per cent? “We just don’t know…”\n\nFriday 16 August\n\nModern Movie Soundtracks At the Proms\n\nBBC Four, 8pm\n\nIt has become a tradition in recent years for the Proms to include a night or two themed around the most populist form of classical music: TV and film scores. Tonight’s eclectic celebration of movie soundtracks from the 2020s was recorded earlier this week at the Royal Albert Hall and is presented by Edith Bowman, and showcases some of contemporary cinema’s most compelling composers.\n\nVolker Bertelmann’s Oscar-winning work on 2022 war epic All Quiet on the Western Front, for instance, is just one of many pieces played here by The London Contemporary Orchestra, conducted by Robert Ames. Elsewhere, you can enjoy Jerskin Fendrix’s quirky score for Frankenstein riff Poor Things; Hildur Guðnadóttir’s eerie soundtrack for cancel-culture satire Tár and Jed Kurzel’s composition for bloody action-flick Monkey Man. There are some exceptions to the theme, with TV shows including Netflix hit Squid Game (whose score was composed by Jung Jae II) getting their time in the spotlight. The night concludes with Max Richter’s devastating On the Nature of Daylight, made famous by the terrific sci-fi film Arrival. SK\n\nOur Lives: Two Sisters, One Goal\n\nBBC One, 7.30pm\n\nThe slice-of-life docu-series returns with the story of Katy and Emma, two sisters from the Welsh village of Brynamman who have decided to arrange an all-star charity football match between Wales and England. They have to find a venue, persuade celebrities and find two big-name managers. The only problem? Neither of them know anything about football.\n\nA New Australian Adventure\n\nBBC Two, 9pm\n\nMiriam Margolyes concludes her Australian odyssey with a visit to Broken Hill, the outback town whose famous mines are dwindling, along with its population. It is an episode themed around reinvention, both for Broken Hill and Margolyes herself, who is adapting to life after a critical heart operation. “If you don’t grow,” she says wisely, “you diminish”.\n\nChampions: Full Gallop\n\nITV1, 9pm\n\nTonight we go behind the scenes of one of the most famous races in the calendar – the Grand National. The million-pound prize pot draws a field of 34 riders, although tonight’s big characters are ambitious trainers Dan Skelton and Willie Mullins.\n\nHostage\n\nMore4, 9pm & 10pm\n\nThis slick six-part Swedish thriller, based on the novel by Kristina Ohlsson, has a killer concept. A plane has been hijacked by terrorists demanding the release of a detained professor. The twist? The co-pilot of the plane is the estranged son of a police officer in charge of rescuing the hostages.\n\nRev\n\nBBC Two, 10pm\n\nIt has been 14 years since the first episode of Rev premiered, and the wry clerical comedy still feels as fresh as ever. The key, of course, is the masterful Tom Hollander, whose disgruntled London priest Adam subverts the idea of the cosy village vicar in favour of something grittier and soulful. A repeat well worth tucking into.\n\nThe Golden Cobra\n\nBBC Three, 10pm & 10.15pm\n\nThis crudely animated cartoon comedy has shades of 2003 cult favourite Monkey Dust, rendering it an acquired taste. It is set around a surreally hellish takeaway in the Welsh valleys, whose curries melt through the floor like acid. In the first of tonight’s two episodes (each 15 minutes long), owner Basil tries to murder a health inspector.\n\nThe Union (2024)\n\nNetflix\n\nMark Wahlberg has certainly had his practice playing agents or officers unafraid to get their hands dirty (or bloody): just cast your mind back to The Corruptor, Patriots Day or Mile 22. In this new action flick from Julian Farino (Giri/Haji), he plays a down-on-his-luck guy who runs into his ex-girlfriend (Halle Berry) at a high-school reunion. One small twist: she’s now a secret agent, and soon drags him into her world of guns and criminal gangs.\n\nDangerous Minds (1995) ★★★\n\n5STAR, 9pm\n\nCritics had mixed feelings towards this drama starring Michelle Pfeiffer: some found it moving, others thought it was full of stereotypes. The soundtrack, featuring Coolio’s Gangsta’s Paradise, however, was a sure-fire hit, topping the charts and certified platinum. Pfeiffer plays a former Marine who takes up a teaching gig at a tough high school near LA. The kids try to wear her down, but her training soon comes in clutch.\n\nBraveheart (1995) ★★★★\n\nBBC One, 10.40pm\n\nMel Gibson sports his woad, his sporran and one of the oddest accents committed to film to play William Wallace in this shouty, gory Highland epic chock full of memorable quotes (“The trouble with Scotland is that it’s full of Scots”). It’s great fun, though perhaps undeserving of its Best Picture Oscar (it won four more). Sophie Marceau, as a sultry love interest, cranks up the anachronism – in reality, Isabella of France was then only six years old.\n\nSpy (2015) ★★★\n\nITV1, 10.45pm\n\nBridesmaids director Paul Feig reunites with Melissa McCarthy for this espionage comedy. McCarthy plays CIA operative Susan, who gets the career break she’s been waiting for when she’s sent to Europe to follow Rose Byrne’s villainous Rayna. There’s plenty of f-bombs, toilet humour and fun action sequences, and Jason Statham and Miranda Hart offer solid support. Feig’s new film Jackpot is on Amazon Prime Video from Thursday.\n\nFilm of the Week: Moon (2009) ★★★★★\n\nBBC Two, 11.05pm\n\nHuman beings have long been obsessed with the planets that exist, far, far away, from our own here on Earth. But no distant object found in space captures our imagination quite like the Moon: from Moonfall to Gravity and First Man. This spectacular sci-fi film by Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie, son of David who introduced his son to the world of 8mm one-stop animation) is among the finest; its echoes of Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and its quiet beauty, make it hard to believe that it marked his directorial debut (he scooped the Bafta for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer). The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, who went on to win an Oscar for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), the only worker in a mining facility on the far side of the Moon, who discovers a chilling truth about his life as he nears the end of his three-year stint of solitude. The creeping sense that something has gone amiss lingers over the film like a blanket of dread, as Sam descends further into unease and starts experiencing mysterious visions; overshadowing any chance he has at a happy reunion with his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter.\n\nTelevision previewers\n\nStephen Kelly (SK), Veronica Lee (VL), Gerard O’Donovan (GO), Poppie Platt (PP) and Gabriel Tate (GT)"
