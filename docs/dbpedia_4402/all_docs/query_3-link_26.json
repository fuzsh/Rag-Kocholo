        "text": "In techno, Jeff Mills is one of one, and he continues to move further from the genre norm. A remarkably prodigious icon who remains deeply associated with Detroit (though he splits his time between Paris and Miami), the 62-year-old DJ/producer is unwilling to be bound to the sounds and ideas that once defined him. A long-time sci-fi adept, he continues to use the language of techno—much of which he almost single-handedly pioneered—to comment on present-day dystopias or suggest new potentialities for anyone still willing to listen.\n\nThough Mills’ time as a turntable wizard, Underground Resistance co-founder, and techno’s ultimate ambassador and autodidact informs every inch of his music, the context of his work has stretched beyond dance culture into something wider and headier. Mills’ compositions are humanist and often highly collaborative, and created in a self-imagined environment (Black American future music gone global, fluent in advanced technology and showing Borgesian comfort with the boundlessness of storytelling), with an eye to continuously revolutionizing the milieu they came from. He remains a dance festival headliner (though, pointedly, very rarely in America), yet the stimulation behind his vast recorded output seems more focused on the mind than the ass.\n\nThe EyeWitness, Mills’ second album of 2024 and one clearly reflecting the dark night of today’s human soul, is a good opportunity to hear how an electronic- and dance-music originator pushes the fruits of his legacy toward a more imaginative discourse. (It’s also one that’s easier to hear, period: After years of being unavailable on streaming platforms, the full-length releases on Mills’ Axis Records are now an easy click away.) It is a set of listening techno that, according to Mills’ liner notes, addresses the effects of shock and trauma on the contemporary condition. That The EyeWitness may have (almost) nothing to do with dancing reflects Mills’ belief that techno’s purpose and history are grounded in principles of future freedoms, intellectual mysteries, and cosmological phenomena, rather than mere physical reaction.\n\nThe EyeWitness’ reaffirms Mills’ marriage of thematic narrative, psychology, and sound, and it has plenty of precedents in the producer’s recent work. His second (!) score for Fritz Lang’s classic 1927 silent film, Metropolis, released in 2023; the exploration of feeling and knowing of 2021’s more rhythm-driven The Clairvoyant; his six-part 2018 radio series The Outer Limits, made with NASA for London’s NTS Radio about the universe and astrophysics—each is a spectacular piece of musical sci-fi storytelling that questions known life’s governability, and brings to mind Samuel R. Delany more than any electronic composer or producer. Yet at their shared musical center rests what may be Detroit techno’s most crucial contribution to modern sound: layers of musical tension without release, chord patterns that don’t resolve, beats that keep unfolding, a music that embraces mystery with no clear ending. It’s a strategy that stands in direct opposition to EDM’s almighty drop and pop’s built-in limitations. It’s also a great metaphor for one way that Mills and the techno culture he represents regard the composition of a track and a set, and what they intuit the payoff to be.\n\nNot only are there no drops on The EyeWitness, there’s barely a kick drum. Only “Indoctrination,” which closes the vinyl release (streamers include four additional, primarily beatless tracks), resembles what a club environment might expect from Mills: a fat four-note loop and bass kick as a maypole for trademark 909 hi-hats to dance around. Even here, layers of synths pile on overdrive-building energy, jabbering like aliens in the background of a scene they actually dominate. Mills’ theme—the way that trauma changes people, and ingrained wounds destroy our relationships with the world and each other—is admittedly a heavy lift for instrumental electronic music, however freeform. The topic is a potential broadsheet of discontent, so Mills’ text purposefully refuses to get stuck in either partisan- or identity-centered moans. What the music does express is the ubiquitous dread brought on by hurt’s cognitive effects.\n\nMuch of Mills’ argument rests on provocative titles, matched by the kind of technologically updated tricks of the sci-fi trade not unfamiliar to UR soldiers or Vangelis stans. Except that Mills long ago reimagined these tricks. Tracks like “In a Traumatized World,” with Mills’ synthesized voice cut up into a chattering invented language that would make Lucasfilm proud, and “Menticide,” a post-WW2 word that describes torturous interrogation techniques meant to reshape a person’s will, are underpinned by sonambient sound effects, synth textures, and haunted melodic figures. This spooky foundation represents the album’s throughline, though, at times, other textures reinforce the nightmarish scenario: “Mass Hypnosis” builds into something approaching a swirl of digital koras and Giorgio Moroder’s Midnight Express sequencers, while “Pledge to the Sacred Iridescent Mirror” centers a martial beat and a minimalist bassline. Overwhelmingly, The Eyewitness is bathed in history’s shadows, unspoken but ever-present.\n\nOnly once does Mills step back from the darkness toward something more polychromatic, reflecting the unexpected metamorphosis when trauma begets beauty. “Wonderous Butterfly” is built on the shipwreck of a musical trope (the chopped recasting of the “Oriental riff”), built into dub-like, looping scaffolding that is the album’s least futurist moment. The track’s two lead lines—one that sounds like a synthetic clarinet, the other like a percussive electric piano—harmonically discolor any sense of cliched meaning, weaving instead into a mysterious, emotionally complicated concerto. Purposefully or not, the riff, the title’s lepidoptera, and the clarinet bring to mind Puccini’s “Madame Butterfly,” a classic product of colonial art whose historic trauma plays in opera houses worldwide. The EyeWitness’ “Butterfly” provides a counter-argument that is part of the whole, a momentary escape from the machines, a simple dance of remixing history in the timeline’s other direction. It’s also proof that Mills’ techno storytelling keeps reasserting itself as a narrative form as complicated as its topics, and as the world that brings them to mind."
