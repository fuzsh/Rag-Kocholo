        "text": "“Black Mass” star Julianne Nicholson will play the lead role in USA Network’s upcoming crime series “Eyewitness,” Variety has learned.\n\nNicholson will play Helen Torrance, a former big-city homicide detective who left her harrowing career to become a small-town sheriff and loving wife. However, when a gruesome crime occurs, she’s thrust back into the traumas of her past – just as she’s begun her hardest case yet: fostering a teenage boy.\n\nTyler Young has also joined the cast as a series regular, playing Helen’s foster son, Philip O’Brien, a sensitive yet tough teenager from the projects who has seen more pain than anyone ever should. He gets a shot to start over with Helen in an idyllic small town. There, Philip’s on the verge of falling in love with a boy from school, Lukas, when they witness a quadruple murder. Philip becomes more troubled than ever as the two boys swear themselves to secrecy for fear of being outed.\n\nThe drama, which hails from Universal Cable Productions, is adapted from Norwegian drama “Øyevitne” by executive producer Adi Hasak. Jarl Emsell Larsen and Scott Peters also executive produce. “Twilight” director Catherine Hardwicke will direct the first two episodes and serves as executive producer on the pilot. The new series explores a grisly crime from the point of view of the eyewitnesses.\n\nPopular on Variety"
