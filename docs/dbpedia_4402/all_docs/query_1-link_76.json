The film was co-written for television by playwrights Kate Brooke and Terry Winsor, and was directed by Adrian Shergold. It was first broadcast on ITV on 14 April 2003. The film details the events following the killing, in which the sole witness to the murder, Cameron's fiancée Danielle Cable (Joanne Froggatt), is forced to change her identity and go into hiding after giving evidence which helped convict Noye in court. The film was screened on the third anniversary of Noye's conviction for Stephen's murder, which occurred on 14 April 2000. Prior to filming, Froggatt met with the real-life Danielle Cable in a secret location, while under the protection of two bodyguards who prevented Danielle from revealing any information that might lead to her being found. Frogatt was later nominated for the Royal Television Society Award for Best Actress for her role as Cable, and the film itself was also nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Single Drama. The film drew 8.59 million viewers on its debut broadcast. Notably, it has never been available on DVD, although it is available on YouTube.
