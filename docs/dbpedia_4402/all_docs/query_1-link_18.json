        "text": "Show Name: Eyewitness\n\nEpisodes: 10 (Only 1 season)\n\nGenre: Contemporary, Romance, Mystery, Suspense, [Young-Adult]\n\nHeat Rating: Slightly warm\n\nTrigger Warning: Cheating (kind of…)\n\nCreator: Adi Hasak\n\nCast: Julianne Nicholson, Tyler Young, James Paxton, Warren Christie\n\nMy Rating:\n\nBlurb:\n\nTeenager Lukas Hallenbeck seemingly has it all — popularity, motocross stardom and an attractive girlfriend — but deep down is conflicted about his sexuality. Those feelings begin to come to the surface when he meets Philip, a classmate with whom he starts a relationship that the boys try to keep secret. Things get more complicated when the teens witness a murder and fear that they will be found by the person who committed the crime. While they stay silent about what they saw, they realize that it can never be unseen and the traumatic event has changed their lives forever. As he is potentially being hunted by the killer, Lukas worries that his secret will be revealed, he will be outed, and he will lose everything. “Eyewitness” is an adaptation of a Norwegian crime thriller.\n\nOh my gosh! This show was sooo freaking goood. I’m still not over it!! I sometimes get lost in YouTube. The other day I was watching a lot of video mash up on YouTube, I think I was probably watching a SKAM video when I stumbled upon a “Philkas” video and damn after watching it, I was hooked and I needed to watch it asap, I ended up binge watching all the 10 episodes in a day!\n\nWhen Lukas and Philip witness a triple homicide in Lukas’s father’s cabin, they decide to keep their mouth shut so that nobody would know they were together. Whereas Philip wants to be with Lukas, Lukas is struggling with coming to terms with his sexuality. One lie leads to a chaos of incidents but the killer is still out there and he is hell bent on leaving no clue behind and that includes the duo.\n\nThe plot was seriously awesome! Lukas and Philip were hanging out in their father’s cabin where they first realise they were attracted towards each other. The first kiss was awkward but haaaawt! But they were (rudely!) interrupted when a car shows up thinking it’s Lukas’s dad but then they become the sole witnesses of a triple homicide. They somehow manage to escape but the actual murderer goes free too. Along with Lukas and Philip, the audience knows who the actual villain is but the rest of the people in the show are unaware of the fact and it was a wild goose chase. The mysterious aspect was maintained so well and there were plenty of nail-biting moments which kept me glued to the screen.\n\nLukas (the blonde guy) was afraid to tell the truth because he thought if he came out in front of everybody, nobody would accept him anymore and Philip agrees reluctantly. And that one lie causes a mayhem! Pretty much. I sometimes hated Lukas because to cover up one lie, he lied more and more and even blamed Philip but after that once incident, it melted my heart because he couldn’t stay away from Philip!! The chemistry between them was so freaking gooood!! And I absolutely adored them together, the romance was off the charts dude!! Although Lukas already had a girlfriend, he did kiss Philip before breaking up with her but it didn’t bother me much because Rose and Lukas didn’t have an actual thing and even Rose acknowledged that.\n\nThe were various other sub plots which merged with original plot line in a fantastic way. We have Helen who is an ex-FBI agent with a dark past of her own and who is now Philip’s foster mom. We’ve also got the FBI team who’s working to bust a drug lord where Kamilah is a working officer and her sister is somehow involved in this and she’s trying her very best to get her and her baby out of this mess. Every single thing was linked to the other and I loved how they were tied together in the end. The villain was seriously villainous! (Sorry for the lack of word! XD) He was in plain sight but nobody knew he was the actual guy!! It made everything more suspenseful! Anyway, not only was he a creep but also a paedophile and my heart was in my chest every time he made a move!\n\nAnyway, I couldn’t get enough of Lukas and Philip. I loooved Philip so much. I think he was so smitten by Lukas that he basically agreed to whatever he said (I only hated one particular incident!!), though he did try to convince him to tell the truth about murders but seeing him uncomfortable, he decided to keep his promise. But as much as Lucas tried to convince himself he was not gay, it was him who initiated the kiss most of the time. And omg… they were pretty good kisses guys!! So good! This show seriously made me so giddy with joy. Lukas and Philip made me so happy. I ship Philkas soooo bad! I also loved how they emphasised on consent before taking a step forward in their relationship. When Lukas is attacked by the villain and goes to coma, and Philip is like trying to bring him back by taking about the stuff they used to do together, that scene was seriously heartbreaking. And I was sooo freaking happy, out of the world happy when they decided not to hide anymore! (Is it even healthy to be so happy over fictional characters because I feel it’s still not enough… XD)\n\nOverall, Eyewitness was a fantastic watch! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have watched all the 10 episodes in a single freaking day! I don’t know why it was cancelled, I would have loved to see more of them together and how their life finally moves forward, together. Nonetheless, the plot was executed in a neat way and all the loose ends were tied in the end. I was pretty much satisfied with the ending but I wanted moooore!!! How could I not? The cast was amazing, the acting was amazing, pretty much everything was amazing, especially the romance between Philip and Lukas! I have a feeling I’ll be rewatching this show numerous times in the future.\n\nRecommend it?\n\nYES!!\n\nSo guys, have any of you watched this show yet? Do you want to? Oh and has anybody seen SKAM?? Because I loooove Even and Isak!!\n\nOh and do you guys have any great LGBTQ tv show/movie recs and also books, where the characters don’t die in the end? I would love some recommendations!"
