        "text": "NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Preparations are underway as New York City and the MTA brace for possible flash flooding when the remnants of Debby arrive on Friday.\n\nAs straphangers hopped off the No. 1 train at the South Ferry station, Eyewitness News reporter Lindsay Tuchman went even deeper - to the pump room where MTA workers are prepping for the potential of heavy rain and flash flooding on Friday.\n\n\"I feel confident. We've inspected our equipment, inspected our track drains,\" said Armando Crespo, MTA's chief infrastructure officer. \"We inspected our known flood areas that we should have a smooth transition into the storm with no issues.\"\n\nThere are nearly 500 pump rooms across the subway system, and five pump trains that are deployed to stations with flooding conditions and then brought to pits.\n\nSubmersible pumps turn on automatically and discharge water to city sewers.\n\nFollow updates on Debby's local impact here\n\nOn a normal day, approximately 13 million gallons of groundwater is pumped out of the system, but with severe storms, that number can suddenly increase.\n\n\"If the water rises enough, we shut off the third rail, which eventually stops the train,\" Crespo said. \"We try to mitigate the water as soon as possible to make sure that we have subway service for our customers.\"\n\nMTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber insisted that New Yorkers will be able to rely on mass transit on Friday, and should, instead of driving, but flash flooding can, and has, led to major service disruptions.\n\n\"We call in, you know, work for us to work the long hours, both to get ready for the event and to be in position in the event that, you know, we need to take action, whether it's to clear a water condition, to cut trees, to send a diesel train in to help in an area with, God forbid, you've lost power,\" Lieber said. \"These are eventualities that we planned for, and we deploy the people to make sure we're ready to execute.\"\n\nIn addition to the MTA, the city is also taking a proactive approach in preparation for the storm.\n\nNYC Emergency Management has issued a travel advisory, and has activated the city's flash flood emergency plan, placing response agencies and crews on alert.\n\nRELATED | NYC storm water flood map\n\n\"New Yorkers are tough and resilient, and we will get through this weather by being prepared and heeding the travel advisory,\" Mayor Eric Adams said. \"That means being informed by subscribing to Notify NYC, having supplies ready, checking in on your neighbors, and having a plan to leave your basement apartment if it starts flooding. Our city agencies are activated and ready to respond to impacts but we need you to do your part. It's important to stay informed, keep streets and roads clear, and look out for one another.\"\n\nNew Yorkers can subscribe to emergency weather alerts online at Notify NYC, which will keep them informed about weather conditions throughout the storm.\n\nNYCEM is encouraging New Yorkers to exercise caution when traveling, expect travel delays and to remain off the roads during and after active weather to allow crews to operate and respond to weather conditions.\n\nThe city has also launched a WhatsApp channel as part of its approach to public messaging and warning.\n\nKeeping in line with the mission to inform, a Department of Environmental Protection event was held Thursday night at Lehman High School's auditorium in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx, where residents took home free flood kits containing barriers, sensors with alarms and sump pumps.\n\nAn informational session was also held, teaching residents how to use the tools and other resources that could prepare them for when it rains, like it did on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's all about helping people understand what they can do to protect themselves from flooding while we take the time because it will take us years, to improve the infrastructure to catch up with climate change,\" said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala.\n\nThe DEP event was planned long before Debby even formed, but it's perfect timing for the community to prepare for the remnants they'll face Friday night.\n\n\"Much of the Bronx is only designed for a 1.33-inch per hour rainfall, and we had 2.9 inches in one hour on Tuesday night,\" Aggarwala said.\n\nThe DEP will continue to host these distributions around the city with hurricane season ramping up, offering information and tips to avoid things like having to call to clear a storm drain clogged with leaves and trash.\n\n\"The reality is that anybody with a rake or a broom can go ahead and just wipe that stuff away, and the water's going to disappear very quickly,\" Aggarwala said.\n\nHere are a list of safety tips:\n\nAllow for extra travel time and expect delays with little to no notice. Use public transportation whenever possible.\n\nDo not walk, bike, or drive into flooded streets or enter flooded subway stations.\n\nIf you live in a basement or below-grade apartment, be aware that you may be vulnerable to flooding. Follow city guidance for additional actions aimed at below-grade dwellings: before or during heavy rain, remove debris from catch basins in your area to allow the water to enter, and pick up the leaves from your yard to keep them from clogging streets and catch basins. Prepare to move to higher ground if flooding begins, even if it's raining.\n\nAhead of the weather, property owners and managers should clean their property, including roofs, crawlspaces, vents, decks/patios, and gutters. Dispose of any debris that could become dangerous projectiles during a storm.\n\nCheck on friends, relatives, and neighbors, especially older adults and people with disabilities, access and functional needs, or health conditions. Help them to prepare if needed.\n\nIf you require assistance for daily activities, make arrangements in advance for support during the expected weather, ensuring caregivers are aware of and prepared for the weather conditions.\n\nCharge your phones and keep a flashlight and batteries handy. If you lose power and have a disability and/or use life-sustaining equipment and need immediate assistance, call 911.\n\nAlways have an emergency kit in your car. It should include items like blankets, a flashlight, water, snacks, a first aid kit, and a snow shovel.\n\nYou can also go online to NYCEM's website for more safety tips.\n\nStay with Eyewitness News and AccuWeather for continuing updates.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New York City news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News"
