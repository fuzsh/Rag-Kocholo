        "text": "The Making of Eyewitness II – Living Earth is a half-hour documentary that explores how the episodes of the second season of Eyewitness were made. The airing date is not fully confirmed, with some sources suggesting it aired only in the US on 2nd December 1996 (the week after the airing of the final episode of the season, Shell) or in 2000. The documentary is narrated by Martin Sheen.\n\nOnly eight episodes of season two are portrayed in this episode – while the VHS releases of Ape, Volcano, Weather, Arctic and Antarctic and Shell all included making-of shorts, these episodes get little to no mention in this documentary.\n\nEpisode[]\n\nOpening sequence[]\n\nThe special begins by flying around a CGI animated camera on a tripod which moves between being completely animated and textured and being a wireframe of lines. The view then zooms through the camera lens and plays the introduction sequence of the second series.\n\nEpisode outline[]\n\nThe documentary begins by introducing the season as a whole. It also introduces the making of the Eyewitness Museum, designed to be infinitely expandable. The process involved mapping out the museum and then filling it with 3D models and live animals.\n\nThe concept of heroes for each episode is introduced, with the lead character in Tree being an artificial oak tree. The construction of the tree is shown, as well as its filming with a moving crane.\n\nFor Prehistoric Life, the model-makers made a model moon that was filmed under low light. Continental drift was filmed by using model continents on wheels, filmed with a fisheye lens. The filming of the primordial soup is also shown.\n\nWhen filming Desert, a camel with experience in the film industry served as the hero. It was the largest animal filmed for the series. The filming of the exploding cactus is also shown.\n\nFor Pond and River, the work of the ice sculptor making the swan is shown, as is the filming of the rippling water effects and the filming of the two segments involving the baby actor.\n\nJust as babies shown natural behaviour on camera, so do animals. The filming of animals for Tree is shown, including a barn owl that never appeared in the episode itself.\n\nFor Rock and Mineral, the art department were an important part of the episode’s creation. The creation of the rock walls for the opening segment and the caveman section are shown, as are the fire-starting segment, the skeleton encountering Smashy the boulder and the bowling section.\n\nFor Seashore, the crew filmed at the beach but also made a sandcastle in the studio. A separate model was made for interior shots of the sandcastle. The smuggler’s cave model took two days to build, but appeared on screen for only ten seconds.\n\nFor the Butterfly and Moth segment, the process of turning the best-selling books into television is examined, with one of the most important parts being the music. Guy Dagul is shown preparing the musical score for the episode. The episode all comes together when the script, which began the production process, is read out. Martin Sheen is shown narrating the Making of feature.\n\nA common effect used in Eyewitness is morphing, while in Mammal a human and horse were combined to make a centaur. The horse was normally used by Young’s Brewery for delivering beer to London pubs. The actor who portrays the centaur also appeared as the caveman, turned by the computer into a shadow.\n\nVideos[]\n\nHome media releases[]\n\nThe Making of Eyewitness II – Living Earth has not been released on VHS. It has been released in certain paired DVD releases."
