        "text": "On June 14, 2007, 32-year-old Christopher Vaughn was found limping on the side of the road near Joliet, IL, bleeding from two gunshot wounds. When police arrived on scene, they found the bodies of his wife and three children shot in the car. Chris is unable to recount the events of that early morning, and there are no other witnesses to the crime. Chris was subsequently convicted of 4 counts of first-degree murder. Although the state intended on imposing the death penalty, it was abolished four years after Chrisâs arrest. His trial hadnât begun, altering the stateâs course of action. He is currently incarcerated and serving 4 consecutive life sentences for the killings.\n\nPlease tell Governor Pritzker about your support for Christopher Vaughn:\n\nhttps://gov.illinois.gov/contact-us/voice-an-opinion.html\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/govpritzker/?hl=en\n\nTo write to Christopher, send letters to:\n\nChristopher Vaughn IDOC#MM33173\n\n5835 State Route 154\n\nPinckneyville, IL 62274\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nhttps://lavaforgood.com/podcast/250-jason-flom-with-rodney-lincoln/\n\nWrongful Conviction is a production of Lava For Goodâ¢ Podcasts in association with Signal Co.

In 1992, a disgruntled associate who had recently shot Calvin implicated him in the murder of Elijah and Salhaddin Harris. Calvin was charged with the double murder and six rival drug dealers testified against him at his 1995 murder trial. No physical evidence connected him to the crime. A jury took only two hours to convict Calvin of murder, and he was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison.Â But he never stopped fighting for his freedom, and the case took a turn with a 2003 affidavit from the key witness against him who confessed to the crime, stating that he âpinned this double murder on Calvin Buari because of a dispute between Calvin and me, and because I wanted complete control of my drug spot.âÂ Journalist Steve Fishman followed Calvinâs story for seven years and eyewitnesses, first interviewed by Fishman, testified in court in 2015 that Calvin was not the murderer. By May 2017, a judge overturned the conviction and ordered 46-year-old Calvin Buari freed. In this episode, Calvin is joined by Steve Fishman, who chronicles his journey for justice in the hit podcast Empire on Blood.\n\nTo learn more, click here:https://link.chtbl.com/KsTvKFl3\n\nWrongful Conviction is a production of Lava for Goodâ¢ Podcasts in association with Signal Co.

Two of his housemates had been brutally murdered. Joe had a drop of blood on his shoe and no memory of the previous night due to alcohol and drug use. He was terrified that he had been the one that killed the two women. Overcome with grief and guilt, he turned himself into the police. Despite his descriptions of the crime never matching the crime scene, and a long list of errors in the investigation, Joe was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death in Virginia.\n\nThat put him in the path of our second guest, anti-death penalty activist and minister Joe Ingle. Together with Marie Deans, they were in the trenches of the fight against the death penalty. Joe Giarratano eventually became an expert in the law, fighting not only his own conviction, but that of other prisoners â arguing one all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nTo learn more, visit:\n\nToo Close to the Flame by Joseph B.

As a result, two people were fatally shot, and another was injured. Initially, the police identified two men as their main suspects, but ultimately dropped those leads. Due to a combination of unethical interrogation techniques and faulty eyewitness testimony, a few members of the Two-Six Street Gang were arrested for the crime, including 18-year-old David Ayala. Despite multiple defense witnesses and no physical evidence tying him to the crime, David was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nTo learn more and get involved, visit:https://www.gofundme.com/f/new-beginnings-for-david-ayala-support-his-reint?qid=62fe5c8abaa69bfeac6d1d0d370dda17\n\nhttps://www.bonjeanlaw.com/\n\nWrongful Conviction is a production of Lava for Goodâ¢ Podcasts in association with Signal Co.
