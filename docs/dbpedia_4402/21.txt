Parents need to know that the Eyewitness series is the rare find for children's research and nonfiction books: dense information and great visuals, with just enough on each page to entice but not overwhelm the reader. With its first books published in 1988 (and updated many times since), the series is still going strong: There are more than 100 Eyewitness books on topics ranging from science and space exploration to history and literature and everything in between. If kids (or parents) want to read about it, chances are Eyewitness covers it. The books are easy to read with small chunks of dense information, so readers won't be intimidated.
