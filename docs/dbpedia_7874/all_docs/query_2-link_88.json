        "text": "Deborah and Yul made two films together – “The King and I” (1956) and “The Journey” (1959). Yul chose personally Deborah to play the role of Anna Leonowens, after seeing her on Broadway in 1955 in “Tea and Sympathy”. The filmings of “The King and I” were made in the winter of 1955-1956. Since then, they became the best of friends, until Yul’s death in 1985. They co-starred together in another great film, “The Journey”, made in Vienna in March-June 1958, a period when there were rumours that there was a love affair between them. But Deborah ended the whole gossip by marrying for the second time. Peter Viertel, who was a talented playwright and also one of the screenwriters for “The Journey”, became her husband in 1960, and Yul was one of the witnesses. The relationship between Deborah and Yul was described by their close friends as “sister to brother” or “equal to equal”, even if Deborah herself admitted that she was very much attracted by Yul’s magnetism and piercing eyes. They trusted each other and they used to visit one another while they both lived in Switzerland in the 60’s.\n\nDeborah Kerr biography and filmography\n\nYul Brynner biography and filmography\n\nSpecial thanks to Basilea for some photos on this website (watermark deborahkerr.es).\n\nPhoto gallery"
