        "text": "A new Broadway production of Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” has been announced. Two-time Tony Award-nominated and Olivier Award-winning director Jamie Lloyd is set to helm the mounting, which will open in the fall of 2025 at an Ambassador Theatre Group house to be announced. Keanu Reeves will star as Estragon alongside Alex Winter as Vladimir.\n\nReeves, known for his roles in over 100 films including the “John Wick” series, “The Matrix” franchise and “Constantine,” will be making his Broadway debut with this production.\n\nWinter previously appeared on the Main Stem in the 1979 production of “Peter Pan” as John Darling and in “The King & I” as Louis Leonowens alongside Yul Brynner. “Waiting for Godot” will mark his first appearance on Broadway since his childhood acting career. Winter recently completed filming the feature “Adulthood” with Josh Gad and Kaya Scodelario, which Winter directed and will co-star in.\n\nThe longstanding friendship between Reeves and Winter dates back 35 years to the filming of “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure.”\n\nLloyd expressed enthusiasm for the collaboration in a statement, “It is a real honor to be collaborating with the brilliant Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter on Samuel Beckett’s sublime masterpiece — one of the greatest plays of all time.”\n\nAdditional details about the production, including theater location, performance dates and casting, will be announced in the coming months.\n\n“Waiting for Godot’” first premiered on Broadway in 1956 starring Bert Lahr and E.G. Marshall. The Beckett play has been revived four times on the Main Stem. The 2009 revival, starring John Glover and John Goodman, earned three Tony nominations, including Best Revival of a Play. The most recent revival opened in 2013 and starred Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\n\nThe 2025 mounting of “Waiting for Godot” is being produced by the Jamie Lloyd Company, ATG Productions, Bad Robot Live, and Gavin Kalin Productions, with general management by 101 Productions, Ltd."
