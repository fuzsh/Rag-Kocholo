        "text": "What would you do if the man you loved was lying about to you about virtually everything, including his real name? Hard to think about, right? Well, thankfully you don’t have to, because that’s the premise of the Charade movie!\n\nCharade is the1963 film that brought actors Audrey Hepburn and Carey Grant together. It follows Hepburn as Reginaafter she finds out that her husband has died, leaving her with no choice but to team up with the mysterious Peter (Grant) in an effort to keep her late husband’s money away from a group of criminals. But what happened with Peter turns out to be the biggest lie of them all!\n\nThe film is currently available for streaming on Tubi, and to celebrate its 61st birthday, we’ve uncovered the nine craziest things that happened behind the scenes.\n\n1. Cary Grant’s clothes were kept on for a reason during the shower scene\n\nThe scene where Grant showers fully clothed wasn’t just for laughs. The actor and production decided that since Gant was nearly 60 years old — and overweight — it would be better for him and the viewers.\n\n2. Audrey Hepburn filmed Charade immediately after another one of her films\n\nRight after filming for Paris When it Sizzles (1964) ended, Hepburn immediately started shooting Charade. Both films are romantic comedies that take place in Paris, France.\n\n3. Charade pays homage to Hitchcock quite a few times\n\nDirector Stanley Donen was a big fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and used Charade to show his appreciation for the recognized Master of Suspense. A very obvious homage happens when Regina Lampert (Hepburn) and Peter Joshua (Grant) share their first kiss while on a boat in the Seine. The scene is very similar to the Hitchcock film North by Northwest (1959), in which Grant kisses Eva Marie Saint. Another Hitchcock easter egg takes place in the opening credits — which commence with a spiral shape, same as in Vertigo (1958).\n\nBecause of these Hitchcock references, Charade is often referred to as “the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made.”\n\n4. Audrey Hepburn’s husband can be seen in the film\n\nDuring the nightclub scene, Hepburn’s husband, Mel Ferrer, can be spotted smoking a cigarette in the background. The two were married from 1954 until 1968 and had one child during that time.\n\n5. Charade was referenced in another Cary Grant film\n\nGrant’s last film — Walk Don’t Run (1966) — showcases the actor whistling while making coffee. Well, it turns out he was whistling the theme song to Charade. Who knew?\n\n6. Audrey Hepburn’s future co-star worked on this film with her as well\n\nCharade features Hepburn and Jacques Marin (who plays Inspector Grandpierre). The two would go on to work together again in How to Steal a Million (1966) three years later. Hepburn would play Nicole Bonnet — one of the two leads, with Martin playing the Chief Guard.\n\nFrom deals with the British government to Audrey misplacing her Oscar — these secrets will amaze you!\n\n7. President John F. Kennedy had a cameo in Charade\n\nWell, his portrait did anyway. During the film’s final scenes at the United States Embassy, viewers can spot a portrait of President John. F Kennedy in the secretary’s office. However, President Kennedy died on November 22, 1963, meaning that scene was filmed before his unfortunate passing. Charade was also released on December 5, 1963, so President Kennedy never saw the cameo.\n\n8. The puppet theater in Charade is real\n\nIf you want to live life like Audrey Hepburn, then go to Paris’ France Puppet Theater that they used in Charade! It’s called The Théatre Vrai Guignolet and is located at the Rond Point des Champs Elysées. It’s been the most famous puppet theater in the country since 1818.\n\n9. Audrey Hepburn smoked a lot on set\n\nDuring filming, the Oscar-winning actress was smoking three packs of cigarettes a day. Grant also used to smoke that much but quit in 1957. It is unclear if being around Hepburn during that time was difficult for him.\n\nFor more Audrey Hepburn content, keep scrolling!\n\n‘Funny Face’: 16 Wild Facts About the 1957 Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire Musical\n\n6 Audrey Hepburn Quotes That Prove She Remains a Timeless Hollywood Icon"
