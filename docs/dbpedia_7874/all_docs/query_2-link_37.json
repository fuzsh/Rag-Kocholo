We begin this week with The King and I (1956), the film that made Brynner a star. The film is based on the true story of a socially forbidden romance between the king and Anna (Deborah Kerr), a British schoolteacher who becomes involved in his efforts to modernize the country. The score included the now-classic songs \"Getting to Know You\" and \"I Have Dreamed\"; Brynner did his own singing while Kerr's voice was dubbed by operatic soprano Marni Nixon. The movie won five Oscars including Best Actor for Brynner. He shaved his head for the role and retained the look as a career trademark.The King and I runs 2 hrs 13 mins.  Also starring Martin Benson and Rita Moreno. Directed by Walter Lang.",
