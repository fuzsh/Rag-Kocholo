On a deeper level, his bald pate signified the type he has played in films and on stage through most of his career. His image—exotic, often sinister, and foreign, yet virile, masculine, and authoritative—was undeniably linked to his physique, his Eurasian facial features, but most especially his bald head.\n\nEarly in his career, most of the publicity surrounding Brynner centered on his baldness. During the production of his early films such as The Ten Commandments and The King and I, articles in popular magazines were quick to equate his baldness with sexual attractiveness. A career article in Newsweek, for example, quoted several female fans at length on the subject of Brynner's appearance. One declared him to be \"ugly magnetic\" while another thought him \"the most attractive man alive even if he grew grass on his head.\" Interestingly, in publicity for later films in which Brynner often donned hairpieces, attention was still directed to his baldness, as photography sessions were arranged by the studios to record the fitting of various wigs.\n\nBrynner had originally shaved his head for his part as the King of Siam in the stage production of The King and I, a role which both made him a star and first presented him as exotic and erotic. Screen roles such as the Pharaoh in The Ten Commandments, the King in the filmed version of The King and I, and Jean Lafitte in The Buccaneer, reinforced this image—an image in stark contrast to that of other box office stars of the 1950s, including John Wayne, Rock Hudson, Jimmy Stewart, and Alan Ladd, who were masculine, yet distinctly American, and were rarely presented in such a sinister or seemingly negative manner.\n\nBrynner himself added to the exotic aspects of his image by inventing several versions of his childhood for various publications. He declared himself to be either a gypsy or the illegitimate son of a gypsy and a wealthy Russian. Often he stated that he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, alternating this story with those about working as a gypsy singer in Parisian night spots or as a trapeze artist in a circus.\n\nThe peak of his film career was perhaps his role as the black-clad leader of a gang of cutthroats and outlaws in John Sturges's The Magnificent Seven. The film emphasized his authoritarian air, while playing down his more exotic side, depicting him as \"the gunfighter,\" an outsider who by the nature of his profession can never be civilized. Brynner would reprise this character type again in later Westerns including Invitation to a Gunfighter, Return of the Seven (a sequel to The Magnificent Seven), Indio Black, and Westworld.\n\nUnfortunately, by the late 1960s too many roles with too little variation had him hopelessly stereotyped as foreign heads of state or doomed gunfighters. In 1968 Variety actually listed him as a liability to producers because his films were consistent financial and critical flops. A move to Switzerland and roles in several European films did little to change his box office status. His most outrageous role, and one that purposely played against his image, was a cameo as a transvestite in The Magic Christian.\n\nBrynner died of lung cancer in 1985. His last \"performance\" was by far his most dramatic and perhaps his most courageous. Shortly before his death, Brynner filmed a public service announcement for the American Cancer Society in which he warned viewers about the dangers of cigarette smoking. Brynner makes clear to the audience in his monologue that by the time they see the commercial, he will already have died from the result of smoking. It was a truly memorable exit from a dynamic film star who had always shrouded himself in drama and mystery.\n\n—Susan M. Doll"
