        "text": "Oscar-nominated actor George Segal, a fixture on ABC sitcom The Goldbergs since 2013 as Albert \"Pops\" Solomon, passed away this morning due to complications from bypass surgery. He was 87.\n\nSegal rose to earlier fame in television as Jack Gallo, the owner and publisher of fictional magazine “Blush” on NBC comedy Just Shoot Me!, which aired from 1997 to 2003.\n\nBorn on February 13, 1934 in Great Neck, New York, Segal signed a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1961, making his film debut in The Young Doctors. He made the rounds on television, with early guest spots in series like Armstrong Circle Theatre, Naked City and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. And his second film role was in the 1962 war drama The Longest Day.\n\nSegal also appeared on the big screen in Act One in 1963 and in a more prominent part in 1964 western Invitation to a Gunfighter opposite Yul Brynner. After joining the cast of Columbia Pictures’ medical drama The New Interns in 1964, he earned the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year and signed a long-term contact with the studio.\n\nOther notable film roles for Segal at the time included Ship of Fools and King Rat in 1965; Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, The Quiller Memorandum and Lost Command in 1966; and The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in 1967. His sole Academy Award nomination was in the category of Best Supporting Actor for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Wolf?\n\nIn 1968, Segal appeared in two well received comedies: Where’s Poppa? and The Owl and the Pussycat opposite Barbra Streisand.\n\nSegal was also a trained banjo player with the release of his debut LP, “The Yama Yama Man”, and ongoing appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He also played the banjo and sang with the Smothers Brothers on their controversial CBS variety series.\n\nMore film roles followed for Segal, including diamond heist comedy The Hot Rock (1972), and Blume in Love and A Touch of Class, both in 1973 and opposite Glenda Jackson. For A Touch of Class, Segal won his second Golden Globe, this time for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nOther starring roles for Segal in the 1970s included Fun With Dick and Jane opposite Jane Fonda, The Terminal Man, Russian Roulette and The Black Bird. In 1979, Segal famously pulled out of the lead role in Blake Edwards' hit comedy 10, resulting in his being replaced by Dudley Moore and sued by Edwards.\n\nIn the 1980s, Segal was featured in two short-lived TV series: CBS sitcom Take Five in 1987, and 1988-89 ABC crime drama Murphy’s Law. Prior to Just Shoot was a short stint on syndicated adventure drama High Tide in 1994. And prior to The Goldbergs was the two season TV Land sitcom Retired at 35.\n\nOn HBO’s Entourage, Segal played the veteran manager Murray Berenson.\n\nSegal had been married three times. He and his first wife had two daughters, Polly and Elizabeth, both of whom survive him. His third wife, Sonia Schultz Greenbaum, also survives him. The couple had been married since 1996."
