        "text": "Russian-born actor Yul Brynner was born on this day, July 11, in 1920 (d. 1985). He was photographed by Karsh in 1956, the same year that Brynner won the Academy Award for Best Actor as King Mongkut in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I; was honored with a ceremony to put his handprints in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, and received the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Rameses II in the Cecil B. DeMille epic The Ten Commandments – Karsh was on set.\n\nSee Charlton Heston as Moses. See more portraits of Yul Brynner."
