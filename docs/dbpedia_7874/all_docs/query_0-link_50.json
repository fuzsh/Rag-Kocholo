        "text": "I finally went and saw The Magnificent Seven (2016) the other night.\n\nI had initially said that I wouldn’t judge this movie by the original,\n\nbut it raises so many issues surrounding modern Film Making – and Westerns\n\nthat I couldn’t resist.\n\n“Justice has a number”\n\n– M7 (2016) tagline\n\n“Remakes? You probably shouldn’t go there.”\n\n– My Favorite Westerns\n\nThe CWF Film Critique System\n\nBeing a Film Critic of no renown, I have deferred my critiquing chores to my unfamous and trusted colleague Cecil W. (Wannabe) Ford! Wannabe is not a respected Film Critic, but to make up for that by his high HO (Highly Opinionated) Rating – especially of himself. This, combined with his unique CWF Critique System (whereby each movie is subjected to Wannabe’s stringent CWF testing criteria) he arrives at a judgment. Maybe.\n\nLet us proceed.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (2016) Review\n\nby Cecil W(annabe). Ford\n\nI like to think that NOTHING is impossible.\n\nBut my expectations were not high.\n\nWhy? Because a Remake of the Magnificent Seven IS pretty well impossible.\n\nDenzel Washington says right there himself at the start of the movie:\n\nQuote:\n\nDenzel Washington (Sam Chisolm):\n\n“Took a job – looking for a some men to join us.”\n\nChris Pratt (Josh Farraday):\n\n“Is it difficult?”\n\nDenzel Washington:\n\n“Impossible.”\n\nThis is not mere dialogue (quoted from the first movie): It’s Film director and Producer Antoine Fuqua’s open admission that there is no way he could make a movie that will equal the Original Magnificent Seven (1960).\n\nNo way.\n\nYou have to give him credit for admitting that. He knew it. And there are definite reasons for that knowledge – things that were beyond his control. I’ll get to those …\n\nThe real question is: Why? Why make the movie? Why make movie that you know is going to be compared to the incomparable? If you know something is impossible, then Why attempt it?\n\nAntoine Fuqua’s last 9 movies have all made money – including M7 2016.\n\nIn Film Making that makes him a SuperStar.\n\nTime for Wannabe’s Test # One:\n\nTest One: The CWF Charismometer\n\nMeasuring Star Power / Charisma / Casting\n\nMy first Test will employ the trusty CWF Charismometer. This will infallibly measure, Star Power, Charisma, and Casting – vital components in any movie – and the main factors that Fuqua, his Writers, and the Producers … or anybody – could not match from the Original Magnificent Seven.\n\nWe’ll start with Yul Brunner and Denzel Washington.\n\nCharismometer says:\n\nDenzel is a Star. No doubt about it. And a good Actor.\n\nAnd if he wasn’t in M7 2016, it wouldn’t hardly be worth a sniff.\n\nBut compared to Yul Brynner?\n\nWell, it’s a good thing I tested Denzel first, because Yul blew my Charismometer to smithereens.\n\nBOOOM!\n\nThis is the first reason – and likely most important reason – M7 2016 couldn’t match the original.\n\nI will next test the rest …\n\nThose Thrilling Stars of Yesteryear\n\nIs it just me? or is the Star Power in modern Film not equal to the Star Power of yesteryear – 50’s and 60’s. 70’s???\n\nJohn Wayne, Cary Grant, Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas, Gregory Peck, James Stewart, Clark Gable, Bogart, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, Fonda, Brando …\n\nI could go on and on and on. And then start on the ladies. Yes. we certainly have Stars and some very good actors these days … but …\n\nPart 2 … Coming Soon\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Magnificent Seven Official Soundtrack theme … Elmer Bernstein\n\nPosters\n\nYul Brynner / Chris\n\nYul Brynner as Chris\n\n“I’ve been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.”\n\nIt’s said that the idea of (“An Americanization of the film, Seven Samurai (1954)”) to The Magnificent Seven, was Yul Brynner’s idea.\n\nIn any case, it’s no secret who the Star of this film was: Yul himself. And a magnificent Star he was – surely one of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood history.\n\nThe whole success of the film and it’s cast – one the the major Western Classics even carries to this day – where constant rumours or a remake swirl. A remake, which would possibly be an impossible task in it’s challenge to find Stars of the stature or a Yul Brynner – and the rest of the cast. A very daunting task.\n\nBrynner cemented his image as Western Film Star and went on to appear in several spin-offs – none of which were as imposing as Magnificent Seven – yet still worthy of a look due to Brynner’s Star power.\n\nAlas dying far too early at the age of 65 from lung cancer.\n\nYul Brynner Western Filmography\n\nThe Magnificent Seven / 1960\n\nInvitation to a Gunfighter / 1964\n\nReturn of the Seven / 1966\n\nVilla Rides / 1968\n\nAdios, Sabata / 1970\n\nCatlow / 1971\n\nWestworld / 1973\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nSteve McQueen / Vin\n\n“We deal in lead, friend.”\n\nBilled 3rd behind Yul Brynner and Eli Wallach, McQueen’s shameless antics to steal scenes is the stuff of movie legends – as McQueen evidently feared Brynner’s notable charisma would overshadow him – and eventually started a one-upmanship duel between Brynner and McQueen throughout the filming. Steve, of course, eventually went on to become a big Star and success in his own right – and I wonder if they both didn’t share a chuckle about all this later on.\n\nIn the long run, it’s interesting that both of these great Stars seemed to pass before their time: McQueen of cancer at age 50 and Brynner of cancer at age 65 – both from smoking.\n\nTragic, as both would have undoubtedly continued to make good work.\n\nSteve McQueen Western Filmography:\n\nTales of the Wells Fargo / TV Western / 1958 Guest Appearance\n\nTrackdown / TV Western / 1958 Guest Appearance (2)\n\nWanted: Dead or Alive / TV Western / 1958 Series Star / 1958 – 1961\n\nThe Magnificent Seven / Co-Star / 1960\n\nNevada Smith / Star / 1966\n\nJunior Bonner / Star (Directed by Sam Pekinpah) / 1972\n\nTom Horn / Star / 1980\n\n___________________________________________\n\nJames Coburn / Britt\n\n“Nobody throws me my own guns and tells me to ride on. Nobody.”\n\nJames Coburn Western Filmography\n\n1959 Ride Lonesome\n\n1959 Face of a Fugitive\n\n1960 The Magnificent Seven\n\n1963 The Man from Galveston\n\n1964 Major Dundee\n\n1967 Waterhole No. 3\n\n1971 Duck, You Sucker! / Renamed A Fistful of Dynamite for U.S. release\n\n1972 A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die / Renamed Massacre At Fort Holman for U.S. release\n\n1973 Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid / Sam Peckinpah\n\n1975 Bite the Bullet\n\n1984 Draw!\n\n1990 Young Guns II\n\n1994 Maverick\n\n1996 Ben Johnson: Third Cowboy on the Right\n\n2000 Texas Rangers\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nCharles Bronson / Bernardo\n\nBronson seemed (to me) to be a man that had paid his dues (he had) and this seemed to shine through his on-screen persona.\n\nBut he had that soft side too – as we see with the kids in The Magnificent Seven. Maybe that comes from his upbringing in a real life family of 14 brothers and sisters.\n\nWhen we are introduced to Bronson in The Magnificent Seven we encounter him chopping wood. You better believe that no acting was necessary. And he could just as easily have been swinging a pick.\n\nIt’s a smart casting trick: choosing people who don’t need to act.\n\nBronson’s unique looks, however, allowed him to play roles of different cultures and races. Mexicans, Indians … his name in The Magnificent Seven is Bernardo O’Rielly … Italian Irish ?\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nCHARLES BRONSON /\n\nCharles Dennis Buchinsky\n\nWIKIPEDIA: Bronson was born Charles Dennis Buchinsky in Ehrenfeld in Cambria County in the coal region of the Allegheny Mountains north of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. During the McCarthy hearings, he changed his last name to Bronson, fearing that Buchinsky sounded “too Russian”; the name was taken from Bronson Avenue in Hollywood, where the famous gated entrance to Paramount Pictures is located.\n\nHe was one of fifteen children born to a Lithuanian (Lipka Tatar) immigrant father and a Lithuanian-American mother. His father, Walter Bunchinski, who later adjusted his surname to Buchinsky to sound more “American”, hailed from the town of Druskininkai. Bronson’s mother, Mary (née Valinsky), whose parents were from Lithuania, was born in the coal mining town of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania. He learned to speak English when he was a teen, before that he spoke Russian and Lithuanian.\n\nBronson was the first member of his family to graduate from high school. As a young child, Bronson did not initially know how to speak English and only learned the language while in his teens. When Bronson was 10 years old, his father died. Young Charles went to work in the coal mines, first in the mining office and then in the mine itself. He earned $1 for each ton of coal that he mined. He worked in the mine until he entered military service during World War II. His family was so poor that, at one time, he reportedly had to wear his sister’s dress to school because of his lack of clothing.\n\nIn 1943, Bronson enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and served as an aerial gunner in the 760th Flexible Gunnery Training Squadron, and in 1945 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crewman with the 39th Bombardment Group based on Guam. He was awarded a Purple Heart for wounds received during his service.”\n\n“I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.”\n\n~ Charles Bronson / The Magnificent Seven.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nRobert Vaughn / Lee\n\n“Till you lose your nerve. You can feel it. Then you wait … for the bullet in the gun that is faster than you are …”\n\nLee is probably the most complicated Character of the Seven.\n\nVaughn’s and (Director) John Stuges’ portrayal of Lee is be-gloved, dapper, dudish, white shirted, articulate gentleman gunsfighter – with a string tie,\n\nwho had lost his nerve and his touch.\n\nA washed up gunslinger.\n\nA bit of a tragic figure to be sure … only redeemed moments before his death – a death we sense is somewhat of a relief for him from the torture of the failure that he feels himself to be.\n\nIt’s pretty well telegraphed to us from the beginning that Lee will not be one of the Seven who rides off into the sunset.\n\nRobert Vaughn Western Filmography\n\nGood Day for a Hanging (1958)\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (1960)\n\nTV Work:\n\nGunsmoke (1956) Guest\n\nFrontier (1956) Guest\n\nTales of Wells Fargo (1957) Guest\n\nThe Rifleman (1958) Guest\n\nLaw of the Plainsman (1959) Guest\n\nWichita Town (1959) Guest\n\nLaramie (1960) Guest\n\nThe Man from Blackhawk (1960) Guest\n\nBonanza (1961) Guest\n\nThe Blue and the Gray (1982 mini-series)\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nHorst Buchholz / Chico\n\nI wonder if people really appreciate the acting of Horst Buchholz in The Magnificent Seven? I doubt it.\n\nHere’s a young German actor who comes over here … and does a Mexican Hat Dance, a mock bullfight, handles the romance, the action, some comic relief, and is also brilliant in the several dramatic scenes including the famous ‘audition scene’ with Yul Brynner. Displaying a breadth and depth of emotion throughout the movie.\n\nPretty heady stuff.\n\nBrynner and Buchholz …. renegotiating\n\nel toro !\n\nHorst Bucholz and Rosenda Monteros\n\n________________________\n\nBrad Dexter / Harry Luck\n\nBrad Dexter as Harry Luck\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\nBronson, Dexter, Vaughn\n\nLet’s call it Luck … bad luck, because sadly, strangely, unfairly, movies often all boil down to that intangible element called Charisma.\n\nYou either got it … or you don’t.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven\n\nThe proof is in the most famous trivia question of Western Film:\n\n“Who was that Seventh guy anyway?”\n\nEven when people are shown his picture …\n\nmost people STILL don’t know his name.\n\nBrad Dexter\n\nPlaying Harry Luck.\n\nAgainst the other members of the Seven … Brad simply fell into shadow.\n\nOh, Brad Dexter was cast correctly for his part alight – as the cynical member of the Seven who was ‘just in it for the money’.\n\nBut most everyone else in the cast was already an established Star (Brynner, McQueen, Wallach) – or moving swiftly up the ladder toward bright daylight (Bronson, Coburn, Bucholz and Vaughn).\n\nBrad simply fell back – and never quite made it.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nBrad Dexter / Veljko Soso\n\nApril 9, 1917 – December 11, 2002\n\nYet Dexter still had a successful film career that spanned some 50 years and included at least 40 movies.\n\nLuck had nothing to do with it.\n\n________________________________________\n\nEli Wallach / Calvera\n\n“My first Western was called The Magnificent Seven.”\n\n~ Eli Wallach\n\nEli Herschel Wallach (born December 7, 1915)\n\nEli Wallach is 97 years old.\n\nIn his acting career Wallach appeared in approximately 90 films and 85 Television shows.\n\n“I never dreamed I would do Westerns.”\n\n~ Eli Wallach\n\nEli Wallach Westerns\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (1960)\n\nHow the West Was Won (1962)\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\nMackenna’s Gold (1969)\n\nLong Live Your Death (1971)\n\nShoot First… Ask Questions Later (1975)\n\nWallach says he once received a letter from the Pope who told him that his favorite Wallach Movie was The Magnificent Seven.\n\n“As an actor I’ve played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters, and Mafiosi than you could shake a stick at.”\n\n~ Eli Wallach\n\nBelow is my favorite Wallach scene from the The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\n\nI heard Wallach say that Director Sergio Leone basically gave him free reign to improvise that scene any way he wanted.\n\nNicely done.\n\nBandito ?\n\nAmazingly, by today’s standards for Western Badguys, Wallach was a pretty nice chap. In The Good, the Bad and the Ugly he may be Ugly and ornery, but he’s basically comic relief, while Eastwood and Van Cleef handle the drama.\n\nLikewise, in The Magnificent Seven, after Wallach and his gang get the drop the Seven, he merely scolds them … and then lets them go! THEN, he gives them back their guns !!! Nice guy. The Seven promptly ride back and kill all the bandits – including Wallach.\n\nHe’s also pretty clean … nice red shirt and vest … no tortilla stains, no spitting, cussing, abusing, raping … a little bit of pillaging … but that’s it.\n\nAnd those peons … in immaculate white togs.\n\nFact is, the Mexican government was furious at the way Mexicans were depicted in a previous Western, Vera Cruz (starring Burt Lancaster and Gary Cooper) and therefore placed people on the set whose job it was to censor any negative depictions of Mexico or Mexicans.\n\nFunny, but nobody seems to notice this … unless someone points it out.\n\nSorry.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n“I always end up being the evil one, and I wouldn’t hurt a fly.”\n\n~ Eli Wallach\n\n________________________________________________\n\nLet’s ride !\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“I never rode shotgun on a hearse before.”\n\n– Steve McQueen / The Magnificent Seven\n\nI could very easily understand it if Tom Cruise’s rumoured remake of The Magnificent Seven never hits the dusty trail. Though you can surely bet that they want to make this movie … and you can surely bet that Western Fans are very interested (there’s a ready-made market out here).\n\nBUT …\n\nThe same problems that plague (and guns down) most remakes (of any genre) are in strong evidence:\n\nMainly, THEY DON’T HAVE THE PEOPLE. Oh yeah, they’ve got all the modern production values … the money … and special effects … etc. BUT … where (oh where) do you find a Director like John Sturges (Gunfight at the OK Corral. Last Train from Gun Hill; Hour of the Gun; Bad Day at Black Rock; Joe Kidd; The Law and Jake Wade, etc) ? or (an inspired script) writing like the previous movie … AND (most importantly) THE CAST to match the previously (great) movie – a Western Classic: Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz …\n\nThe horrible reality is … you can’t.\n\nFor starters, where do you find a Yul Brynner ????\n\nThere ain’t any. He was one of a kind. The Man.\n\nDo you see anybody around who can fill those boots ??\n\nI don’t. But I don’t know everything.\n\nSo … OK … let’s not give up so easily. Let’s suppose that these nagging points aren’t going to discourage Tom – and he is planning to go ahead – as I’m sure he will.\n\nLet’s play movie maker then … Casting Director … and try to pull this off.\n\nHere we go …\n\nNumber 1: Casting Chris\n\nThis is going to be the hardest role to cast. It makes or breaks the movie even before it hits the screen … or the fan.\n\nI’m supposing (if this really is Tom Cruise‘s project) that Tom is considering playing Yul Brynner‘s role as Chris.\n\nYeah.\n\nWill that work? Can he pull it off? Mission impossible?\n\nYou know, I like Tom Cruise as an actor. Most of his stuff is pretty good – and entertaining.\n\nBUT … really.\n\nHmmm. But maybe Tom will look things over\n\nand decide to cast somebody else here.\n\n???\n\nor will he bravely shave his head and brazenly ride forward !?!\n\n???\n\nIF he does decide to cast someone else here …\n\nthen who ??\n\nIs there a Star around with the charisma, power and presence of Yul Brynner ??\n\nWhat do you think ??\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nLet’s see you part this sea Amigo!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
