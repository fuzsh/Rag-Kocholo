        "text": "Yul Brynner, who became identified with his role as the Siamese monarch in ''The King and I'' in a way that few performers ever have been linked with a character, died yesterday at New York Hospital after a long bout with cancer. He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.\n\nMr. Brynner's death came only four months after he completed a triumphal return to Broadway in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. He carried on with a coast-to-coast ''farewell engagement'' tour even though he had been diagnosed as having lung cancer in September 1983, and he missed only a handful of performances.\n\n''He faced death with a dignity and strength that astonished his doctors,'' said Josh Ellis, the actor's press representative. Mr. Brynner's wife, Kathy, and his four children were at the actor's bedside when he died at 1 A.M., Mr. Ellis said.\n\n''The Rodgers and Hammerstein families are deeply grieved by the death of Yul Brynner,'' Theodore S. Chapin, the managing director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, said yesterday. ''His connection with us has been long. Our feelings for him have always been admiration, respect, gratitude and affection. He was a singular man. We will miss him.''\n\nMr. Brynner gave 4,625 performances as the King of Siam over the course of 30 years, taking his final curtain call at the Broadway Theater on June 30 this year as the orchestra and audience serenaded him with ''Auld Lang Syne.'' Mr. Brynner won an Oscar as best actor for his role in the 1956 film of the musical.\n\nA Rare Fusion\n\nFrom the first performance to the last, critics recognized a rare fusion of actor and assignment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
