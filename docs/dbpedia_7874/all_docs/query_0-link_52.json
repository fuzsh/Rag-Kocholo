        "text": "6 random things that happened on this day, October 10th, in showbiz history\n\n1956 Giant with its gargantuan running time and trifecta of iconic stars -- Taylor, Dean, Hudson (plus Mineo & McCambridge!) --gets its world premiere in NYC. It will open for Thanksgiving in movie theaters and lead Oscar nomination morning with 10 citations. Sadly it will lose Best Picture to a much lesser movie, Around the World in 80 Days. But these things happen in Oscar annals.\n\n1963 From Russia With Love, the second Bond film, has its world premiere in London and goes on to become an even bigger hit than the franchise launch Dr No.\n\n1975 Hollywood's favourite perpetually tumultuous love affair continues; Elizabeth Taylor (43) remarries Richard Burton (49) just sixteen months after divorcing him. They'll divorce again nine months later making that second marriage much much shorter than the first (which lasted 10 years).\n\n1983 Sir Ralph Richardson dies at 80. Five months after his death Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan: Lord of the Apes opens in movie theaters. He then becomes the first posthumous Oscar nominee within the Supporting Actor category. There has only been one since, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (2008). Both actors had lost the Oscar on their first and only other nomination for beloved best picture losers, The Heiress (1949) and Brokeback Mountain (2005) respectively.\n\n1985 Two film legends die on the same day: auteur Orson Welles and movie star Yul Brynner.\n\n2017 Thor Ragnarok premieres in Los Angeles\n\nToday's Birthday Suit\n\nHappy 38th to sexy Dan Stevens. He's made such interesting choices since his Cousin Matthew breakout on Downton Abbey. Do you like his... ahem... work?\n\nOther actors born on this day: Zain Al Rafeea from Capernaum (16), Rakul Preet Singh (30), Aimee Teegarden (31), Rose McIver (32), Chiaki Kuriyama aka \"GoGo\" from Kill Bill (36), Mario Lopez (47), Wendi McLendon-Covey (51), Manu Bennett (51), Bai Ling (54), Bradley Whitford (61), Julia Sweeney (61), Jessica Harper (71), Ben Vereen (74), Charles Dance (74), and Peter Coyote (79)\n\nOther Showbiz Types: Pop star Mya (41), Director Carlos Reygadas (49), Composer Michael Giacchino (53), Director Tim Miller (56), Jodi Benson, the voice of the Little Mermaid (59), Broadway star Victoria Clark (61), Country star Tanya Tucker (62), Van Halen's David Lee Roth (66), and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (72)\n\nGone but Not Forgotten: Acting legend Helen Hayes born on this day in 1900, Writer James Clavell born on this day in 1921, Bad movie patron saint Ed Wood Jr (pictured left) born on this day in 1924, Character actor Richard Jaeckel born on this day in 1926, \"Large Marge\" herself Alice Nunn (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure) born on this day in 1927, Playwright and Oscar nominee Harold Pinter born on this day in 1930, Makeup artist Jay Sebring (recently played by Emile Hirsch) born on this day in 1933, Oscar nominee Daniel Massey (Star!) born on this day in 1933, Broadway star Gary Beach born on this day in 1947, Pop star actress Anita Mui born on this day in 1963, Actor Chris Penn born on this day in 1965\n\nWait, Giant lost to Around the World in 80 Days... OH FUCK YOU ACADEMY AWARDS.\n\nThor Ragnarok... one of the best films of the MCU!!!!! In all honesty, I think it's one of the best superhero films ever made. It's also one of the funniest. It's a film that features many of Taika Waititi's themes of comedy/tragedy as it relates to Odin's sins and the guilt he had in not being a better father to both Thor and Loki. It's a film that play into the idea of superheroes as there are these serious monologues that then get cut by humor. It's a film about friendship as that scene of Thor and Hulk arguing show exactly that underneath this big angry monster is someone with feelings. Plus, how can anyone not love Hulk be so innocent? BIG MONSTER!!!! HULK!!!!!!!!\n\n\"Hulk! For once in your life... do not smash!\" \"BUT, BIG MONSTER!\" Mark Ruffalo deserves a lot more credit for fleshing out the Hulk more as he really brought the humanity in that character. NO BANNER! ONLY HULK!"
