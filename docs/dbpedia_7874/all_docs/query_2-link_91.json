        "text": "DEAR JOAN:\n\nYears ago I saw a movie — I think it was with Burt Lancaster — about professional pool players. It had an unforgettable line: “I’ve taught you everything you know but I didn’t teach you everything I know.”\n\nCan you help me find the name of this movie?\n\nDanny L., Benicia\n\nDear Danny:\n\nI think the movie you’re thinking of is “The Color of Money,” the 1986 sequel to 1961’s “The Hustler.”\n\nBoth films starred Paul Newman as Fast Eddie Felson. In “The Color of Money,” the older Eddie serves as a mentor to Tom Cruise’s character, Vincent Lauria.\n\nNewman utters that memorable line, “I taught you every thing you know, but I didn’t teach you everything I know.”\n\nIt’s a good line and a version of it has been used in other movies, including “Rocky IV.”\n\nDear Joan:\n\nI remember a movie starring Yul Brynner called “The Sound and the Fury,” based on a Faulkner novel. I’ve tried to find a DVD of it but can’t find it listed anywhere.\n\nHave you ever heard of it? It was made back when Yul still had hair. I think Natalie Wood was his co-star.\n\nElizabeth C., cyberspace\n\nDear Elizabeth:\n\nI answered a question about Paul Newman, so it seems fitting that I answer one about his wife, Joanne Woodward (not Wood), who co-starred with Brynner in this 1959 film.\n\nThe movie has been shown on television off and on for dozens of years but has never made it to video. That doesn’t mean you can’t find copies, though. They’re out there, made from who knows what source, so just remember, if you buy, you won’t be getting a pristine copy. But if you’re willing, try searching for the title on your favorite search engine and eBay.\n\nDear Joan:\n\nWhen my two sisters and I were young we used to sing in church and at various family functions. One of our favorite songs was about a “lonely little robin.” As adults, we would like to revive our trio for a family reunion celebrating our mother’s 90th birthday, but we cannot find all of the words — we can only remember the chorus.\n\nWe would be so happy if we could get the words for the rest of the song.\n\nMyrna E., Tucson, Ariz.\n\nDear Myrna:\n\nThe song, written by prolific Cy Coben, was a hit for Jim Ed Brown and the Browns in 1960.\n\nHappy birthday to your mom, and have fun singing “Lonely Little Robin.”\n\n“There’s a lonely little robin in a tree by my door/And it waits for its mate to return evermore/So remember, please remember, that I’m lonely too/Like the lonely little robin, I’m waiting for you.\n\n“When you went away, dear, you promised that you’d write/And I thought that you would be true/But I find the mailbox as empty day and night/As empty as the arms that held you.\n\n“There’s a lonely little robin in a tree by my door/And it waits for its mate to return evermore/So remember, please remember, that I’m lonely too/Like the lonely little robin, I’m waiting for you.\n\n“I walk down the lane, down the lane we used to walk/Where we strolled together for years/And my cheeks are red, as it’s hard for me to tell/If raindrops are falling, my dear.\n\n“There’s a lonely little robin in a tree by my door/And it waits for its mate to return evermore/So remember, please remember, that I’m lonely too/Like the lonely little robin I’m waiting for you.\n\n“Like the lonely little robin I’m waiting for you.”"
