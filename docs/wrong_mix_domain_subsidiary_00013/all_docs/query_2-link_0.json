        "text": "TTX Company, a railcar pooling company that operates more than 165,000 railcars across North America, has replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite to support its mission of improving regional transportation efficiency. In addition, TTX has selected Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse to improve decision making. With the Oracle Cloud, TTX has been able to optimize finance, supply chain, and HR processes to reduce costs and rapidly respond to changing customer demands.\n\nTTX provides high-quality, cost-effective railcars, maintenance, and pooling services to help efficiently transport goods and raw materials across North America. To ensure it could quickly respond to changing business demands, TTX decided it was time to replace its on-premises SAP systems, which were highly customized, difficult to maintain and upgrade, and dependent on significant manual effort as well as systems from point SaaS providers. After an extensive evaluation, TTX chose Oracle Fusion Applications to replace its SAP applications and business intelligence tools, as Oracle provided a complete and integrated suite of finance, supply chain, and HR cloud applications and a cloud analytics platform that would enable access to the latest innovations and industry best practices.\n\n“We had a heavily customized on-premises SAP ERP system, which required custom code and third-party software-as-a-service apps for other functions, including HR,” said Bruce Schinelli, chief information officer, TTX Corporation. “This ‘goat’s breakfast’ of systems required a lot of manual effort to use and maintain, so adapting to change or even keeping up with technology advancements was nearly impossible. Oracle Fusion Applications gave us the most complete modern suite of enterprise applications on a common data-sharing platform, allowing us to concentrate on growing our business and not on the technology that supports it.”\n\nTTX implemented Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM), and Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM). With Oracle Fusion Applications for finance, supply chain and HR, TTX has been able to standardize business processes to increase productivity, reduce costs and enhance employee experience. The addition of Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse will also help TTX streamline access to data, expand reporting capabilities with metrics, KPIs and other analytics, and use embedded machine learning capabilities to enable faster and smarter decisions.\n\n“Oracle has allowed us to navigate unexpected changes in demand—spotting the drop in usage early so we could control costs in line with revenues – all while working remotely,” said Vicki Dudley, chief financial officer and treasurer, TTX Corporation. “The ability to take quick action based on real-time insights enabled us to meet our financial plan targets for 2020, even though we got there in some unexpected ways. With our old SAP systems, we just wouldn’t have been able to be that agile.”\n\n“TTX plays a huge role in controlling logistics costs and keeping the North American economy moving,” said Steve Miranda, executive vice president of applications development, Oracle. “We’re extraordinarily proud to be part of the company’s success. With Oracle Fusion Applications, TTX is now more agile—with greater visibility of demand and more control over costs - so it can continue to serve the North American rail industry and thrive in whatever business environment we’re faced with next.”"
