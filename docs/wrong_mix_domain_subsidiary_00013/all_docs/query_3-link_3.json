        "text": "New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, American railroad operating in southern New England and New York. It was absorbed by the Penn Central Transportation Company in 1969.\n\nIt was built up from about 125 small railroads, the earliest of which began operation in 1834 as the Hartford and New Haven Railroad. In 1872 the New York and New Haven Railroad Company joined with the Hartford and New Haven to form the New York, New Haven and Hartford. Eventually it had 1,800 miles (2,900 km) of main track.\n\nThe company electrified its track between New York and New Haven between 1907 and 1914; this was the first electrification of a main rail line in the United States. The opening of the Connecticut Turnpike in 1959 cut heavily into its revenues, and in 1961 it entered bankruptcy proceedings."
