THE NEW SAVINGS BANK INVESTMENT LAW OF MASSACHUSETTS. Two of the New England States have completely revised their Savings Banks investment laws the present year. The States are Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Rhode Island statute is referred to in a subsequent article. The Massachusetts law, however, attracts the most attention by reason of the magnitude of the deposits of the savings institutions in that State. In this latter respect the Massachusetts institutions stand second only to those of New York, and on October 31 1907 the aggregate deposits of the Massachusetts savings banks amounted to $706,940,596. Like the savings banks of New York, the Massachusetts savings institutions are all mutual concerns—that is, have no capital stock and are managed entirely in the interest and for the benefit of their depo§itors—and 700 million dollars is, obviously, a large body of funds for which to find safe and remunerative investment. Massachusetts has always provid0 a broader basis for the employment of savings bank funds than New York,and has allowed a wider choice and discretion. It cannot be claimed, either, that those trusting their savings with such institutions have suffered any through this fact. Restrictions were prescribed which, while perhaps less stringent than iii some States, were nevertheless found adequate by experience. The changes now made are in the direction of allowing still wider scope and latitude. As far as the wording and language of the law are concerned, there has been almost complete revision from beginning to end. In many particulars, however, the alteration in phraseology involves no essential modification of the requirements and provisions of the old law, the No. 2266. amendments being directed towards securing, through general grouping and definitions, the same objects as were previously reached by separate and specific enumeration of the securities in which permission was given to invest. In other words, where before many of the permissible investments were specifically named, now general requirements are fixed, and these requirements are so framed as to take in these same securities. This is particularly true with reference to the sections of the law dealing with the railroad investments. However, aside from the scheme of generalization provided, certain important additions have been made to the list of investments. We cannot undertake in this article to outline all the changes that have been made, large and small. In the proper place,under the State of Massachusetts on subsequent pages (pages 19 to 21),we give the full text of the new law and in previous semi-annual issues of this publication can be found the wording and language of the old law. Furthermore, in the \"Chronicle\" of August 1 1908, pages 257 to 260, we printed the essential parts of a circular issued last June by Pierre Jay, the Massachusetts Bank Commissioner, in which, for the information of the banks, he summarized the more important of the changes made. In the present discussion we shall confine ourselves to indicating only the most striking of the alterations and those of chief interest. Taking up first the provisions relating to railroad investments, we find three general groups or classes. In the first are placed Massachusetts roads, in the second New England roads generally and in the third other railroads. All the provisions are general in their nature. The banks may invest in the bonds or notes of any Massachusetts railroad which has paid cash dividends of 4 per cent on all of its issues of stock for the five years next preceding the date of investment. They may also invest, under certain conditions and restrictions, in the first or refunding mortgage bonds issued, assumed or guaranteed by any New England railroad which has paid cash dividends of 4 per cent on all of its outstanding stock for the five years next preceding the date of investment, but the amount paid in dividends must equal one-third of the amount paid in interest on its funded indebtedness. Lastly, the banks may invest in certain mortgage bonds of any railroad incorporated in any of the United States which has, during each of the ten years next preceding the date of investment, (1) either owned 500 miles of railroad, or, owning less mileage, had gross earnings of not less than $15,000,000; (2) paid the matured principal and 0 STATE AND CITY SECTION. interest of all its mortgage indebtedness; (3) paid cash dividends of 4% on all of its outstanding capital stock; (4) had gross earnings equal to at least five times the amount necessary to pay its interest and rentals. The requirements in this last instance are much like the similar requirements in the New York law, and the phraseology is in some parts precisely the same, making it evident that the New York statutes were • used as a basis to build on. There are also other provisions regarding the railroad investments closely similar to those of the New York law. In this we have reference to refunding bonds or bonds assumed or guaranteed. These provisions, however, are very lengthy and could not well be repeated here. In a general way it may be said that the bonds authorized for investment must be either first mortgages or refunding mortgages. The first mortgages must be a first lien on not less than 100 miles of railroad, exclusive of sidings, and, except in the case of general refunding mortgages, the date of all mortgages securing such bonds must be at least five years prior to the date of investment, and the railroad subject to the lien of the mortgage must have been operated by the corporation which issues, assumes or guarantees the bonds for at least five years prior to the date of investment. The amount of capital stock outstanding, it is required, must equal at least one-third of the total authorized indebtedness. It is also provided, as in the New York law, that bonds which have been legal investments shall not be rendered illegal through consolidation, provided the consolidated or purchasing corporation shall assume the payment of the bonds and shall continue to pay interest or dividends (at the required rate), or both, upon the securities issued against, in exchange for or to acquire the stock of the corporation consolidated or the property purchased. There is a further and a novel provision, evidently suggested by the great shrinkage in railroad revenues which succeeded the panic of last October and November. This provision is to the effect that bonds which have been or shall become legal investments under any of the provisions of the Act, shall not be rendered illegal, although the corporation issuing, assuming, or guaranteeing such bonds shall fail for a period not exceeding two successive fiscal years to comply with the requirement that gross earnings must be equal to at least five times the amount necessary to pay interest and rentals. During said period, however, no further investment in the bonds issued, assumed or guaranteed shall be made. If, after the expiration of said period, the corporation complies for the following fiscal year with all the requirements as to the relation between earnings and charges, it shall be regarded as having complied therewith during said period. Under date of November 6 1908, Commissioner Jay issued a circular indicating all the railroad and street railway bonds which he deemed legal investments, and also named the cities outside of New England the municipal bonds of which could be purchased. This circular will be found printed in full in the \"Chronicle\" of November 14 1908, pages 1274 and 1275. The old Massachusetts law was liberal in the matter of the investment in personal notes. For instance, savings institutions could invest in the note or notes of citizens of Massachusetts with a pledge as collateral of the shares of capital stock of New England railroads fulfilling certain requirements as to dividends, Sze. The law has now been made even more liberal. These loans on personal security are now divided into five classes. One of these classes permits investments in notes or bonds of certain public service corporations doing business in Massachusetts—gas, electric light, telephone or street railway corporations, provided the net earnings of such corporation for three years preceding shall have been equal to 4 per cent on all its capital stock outstanding in each of said years. Another class permits investments in bonds or notes of railroads meeting the conditions mentioned above regarding mortgage investments in the same. It is LIckx-vil. provided, though, that the principal of such bond or note must be payable at a time not exceeding one year after the date of investment therein. That this widens very materially the scope of investments of that class is evident from a circular issued last month (Oct. 24) by Commissioner Jay, in which he gives the opinion that savings banks may, under such grant of authority,purchase Chicago & North Western Railway Company debenture 5s due November 1 1909; Chicago Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company collateral trust 6% notes due April 1 1909; equipment gold 432% notes of the same company due February 1 1909 and August 1 1909; Delaware & Hudson 3% car trust certificates due May 15 1909 and Delaware & Hudson 4% debentures due January 1 1909. Still another class of personal loans provides for loans on notes \"of a responsible borrower in such form as the Commissioner may approve,\" with a pledge as collateral, at not more than 80% of their market value, of the shares of railroad corporations in Massachusetts, in New England, and elsewhere in the United States, meeting the requirements regarding bond investments in the same. In the circular just referred to, issued by Commissioner Jay, a list is furnished of such railroad corporations the shares of which may be taken as collateral at 80% of their value. The list is a long one, and includes among others the names of the Boston & Maine Railroad, the Boston & Albany, the New Haven,the North Western,the Burlington & Quincy,the Mil.& St. Paul,the Rock Island, the Del. & Hud., the Lackawanna, the Ill. Cent., the Lake Shore, the Michigan Central, the New York Central and the Pennsylvania. Most noteworthy of all is the permission to make investment in notes of responsible borrowers with a pledge as collateral of \"such other bonds, notes or shares of corporations or associations and at such percentages as the board of investment (of the savings bank) shall approve.\" It is provided in this instance that if the Bank Commissioner shall disapprove any such bonds, notes or shares, he shall make such recommendations in writing to the board of investment of such corporation \"as the case may require\",and shall include in his annual report a statement of the facts in each case in which such board of investment has not complied with his recommendations in a manner satisfactory to him. Another departure is that bonds of telephone companies are added to the list of authorized investments. The restrictions are well defined and would appear to be adequate. The gross income of the telephone company must have been not less than $10,000,000 during each of the five fiscal years next preceding the date of investment; it must have met all its obligations for the same period of time; it must have paid in dividends in cash an amount, equal to not less than 6% per annum on all its outstanding issues of capital stock; and the dividends paid must not have been less than the total amount necessary to pay the interest upon its entire outstanding indebtedness. The bonds must be a first mortgage upon at least 75% of the property of the company or else be secured by the deposit with a trust company of bonds and shares of other telephone corporations under an indenture of trust limiting the amount of bonds so secured to 75% of the value of the securities deposited. Not more than 2% of the deposits of any savings bank may be invested in the bonds of telephone companies and a majority of the directors must be residents of the commonwealth. It appears from the Commissioner's circular of November 6 that the only bonds at present fulfilling all the requirements are the American Telegraph & Telephone Co. collateral 4s due in 1929. Massachusetts savings institutions have long been authorized to invest in the shares of Massachusetts banks and trust companies and the shares of national banks in New England, under certain conditions and restrictions. The changes here are that where before a bank might hold 35% of its deposits invested, by Nov., 1908.] STATE AND CITY SECTION. way of investment and as security for loans, in such shares, now not more than 20% is allowed. In the case of investments in State and municipal securities the changes are not very marked. The amendments consist in requiring that water districts in the New England States other than Massachusetts must have at least 5,000 inhabitants and that in the case of certain cities of 200,000 or more inhabitants, authorized for investment,the bonds may be purchased where the net indebtedness reaches 7%, where previously the limit was fixed at 5%. As regards street railway bonds, general provisions are inserted relative to dividends to stockholders of these corporations. THE NEW INVESTMENT LAW OF RHODE ISLAND. Rhode Island, too, has changed its law regulating the investments of savings institutions. Perhaps it would be better to say that the State has for the first time put on its statute books a law dealing in a broad and comprehensive way with the question of savings bank investments by providing definite and well-considered restrictions and safeguards. The old law was exceedingly general in its nature and also vague and indefinite, imposing scarcely any limitations upon the judgment and latitude of the managers of these institutions. Nor were there any prescribed requirements, or standards of condition, as to the securities in which investments were permitted. For example, while the law granted authority to employ the funds of the banks in the stocks or bonds of any State, and in the notes or bonds of any town or city, no prohibition was imposed against States or municipalities which might be in default in the payment of their obligations, nor was any limit of indebtedness fixed which, if exceeded, would take the securities of a municipality out of the permissible list. In truth, the old law was very loosely drawn and the whole of its provisions were compassed within a few short paragraphs. Its nature and character will appear when we say that it merely provided that institutions for savings should invest their receipts (1) in public stocks or bonds of any State or of the United States; (2) or in any bank stock; (3) or in notes or bonds of any town or city or in notes of any school district or fire district in any New England State; or (4)—and we wish to direct particular attention to this provision—\"in such corporate stocks or bonds as they may deem safe and secure.\" Could anything be more unqualified than this provision? Besides these four designated groups there were just two other groups, which completed the designated list of securities under the old law. These two additional groups provided (5) that savings institutions might discount notes, bonds or drafts of individuals or corporations with two other responsible endorsers,sureties or guarantors; and (6) invest in the notes, bonds or drafts of individuals or corporations secured by the public notes, stocks or bonds of any State of the United States, or of any town or city or of any school district or fire district in any New England State, or \"by the stock or bonds of any corporation which may be deemed to be safe\", or by mortgage on real estate. This is as far as the old law went in safeguarding the deposits—which, evidently, was not very far. All this is changed under the new statute. This provides a broad field for investment, yet prescribes in each instance certain more or less stringent conditions and restrictions. Where before, under the old law, investment was permitted in the stocks and bonds of any State without qualification, now there is the proviso that suet' State or Territory shall not in the ten years preceding the time of making the investment have repudiated its debt or failed to pay the interest due thereon. In the case of municipal obligations definite limits of indebtedness and of population are provided, instead of no limits at all. Changes of this nature are found throughout the new law. At the end of this article we print the complete text of the new statute, and there is no occasion, therefore, 7 to go at length into the details of the different provisions here. A brief general outline, however, to indicate what the different clauses contain, and pointing out special distinctive features, may be of service. Eleven distinct groups of investments are dealt with, but only about half of these are of general interest, the rest giving authority to erect or purchase a suitable building, to hold real estate acquired by foreclosure, to make loans to depositors, to hold stocks, bonds or other securities acquired in settlements effected to secure loans or indebtedness, &c. The eighth group deals with notes of gas, water, electric light or power, telephone, railroad or street railway companies. In this instance it is required that the company shall have been incorporated or be doing business in Rhode Island and that dividends of at least 4% per annum shall have been paid each fiscal year upon all issues of capital stock for five years next preceding the date of the investment. In the case of all the different groups, definite standards are fixed to which the security and the corporation issuing the same must conform. In the second group, relating to investments in the bonds of steam railroads, there are eight sub-divisions, but the broad general requirement is that the issuing company or the guaranteeing company shall have earned for three years preceding, after payment of all operating expenses, maintenance charges, rentals, taxes, and all interest and dividends guaranteed, not less than twice the current annual interest on all indebtedness outstanding secured by the mortgage under which the bonds are issued, or by any prior lien. One of the sub-divisions gives authority to invest in the notes of an individual, co-partnership, or corporation, with a pledge as collateral of shares of the stock of steam railroads. In this case, it is required that the company shall have earned and paid regular dividends of not less than 4% per annum in each fiscal year on all of its issues of capital stock for five years last preceding the investment, and the shares must be listed on the New York, Boston, Phila. or Chic. Stock Exchanges. In the third group, giving authority to invest in the mortgage bonds of any electric railroad, street railway, gas, electric light or power company, there is also a requirement that for three years preceding the company shall have earned not less than twice the interest on all its current indebtedness. But there are also additional provisos which wisdom and experience have suggested. Thus, in the case of companies organized under Rhode Island law, it is provided that the bonds shall mature at least five years before the expiration of the franchise under which the electric railroad, or street railway, gas, electric-light or power company may be operated. In the case of companies organized under the laws of other States, there are other special provisos. The bonds of an electric railroad or street railway are to be legal investments only in case the company shall have had,for a period of three years,average gross earnings of not less than $400,000 a year. Where the company is a gas, electric light or power company, or a company combining these leatures or any two of the same, the bonds are to be legal only where the gross earnings have been not less than $200,000 a year for the period of three years. Where there is a combination of the railway business with the gas or electric light or power business, or any two or more of them, gross earnings must have been not less than $600,000 a year. The seventh clause, dealing with personal loans, contains some rather anomalous language,inasmuch as it provides that if the deposits and income \"cannot be profitably invested in the modes hereinbefore described, not exceeding one-third part thereof may be invested in promissory notes or other personal securities, payable and to be paid at a time not exceeding one year, with at least one responsible surety, or secured by collateral,\" &c. It would seem from this that it was the legislative intent that such notes should be taken only in case profitable employment for the deposits could not be obtained through the other classes of invest- S STATE AND CITY SECTION. ment, a condition which ought never to arise, seeing how extensive is the list of securities afforded by these other classes. As, however, the trustees of the institutions are apparently the sole judges in the matter, it is obvious that the proviso making the purchase of the notes dependent on the non-profitability of the other investments can be of little practical effect. We now add the full text of the new law. NWSECTION 57.

The following is a statement of the debt of the United States past and present. To add to its usefulness we give references to the laws authorizing each of the issues of bonds outstanding to-day, and likewise, so far as we deem it needful, citations from those laws. All our figures, except when otherwise noted, represent the status at the close of business June 30 or the beginning of business on July 1 of each fiscal year. To conform to that feature and yet furnish information through which any reader can always have the data for a correct exhibit of the debt situation at any past or future day, and make an accurate comparison with previous years, we present, first, the details as they stood at the close of the last fiscal year ending June 301908; second, the changes in those details since June 30 1908 down to Nov. 1 1908; third, the items of interest-bearing debt, &c., at the beginning of each fiscal year since July 1 1878; fourth, we publish in the \"Chronicle\" every month—usually the first or second Saturday—the full detailed Government statement of the debt as reported by the Treasurer on the last day of the previous month; some months lack of space forces us to delay the publication to a later week. With these data at his command, it would seem as if any inquirer could satisfy himself fully with reference to every point which might become of importance for him to know respecting the United States debt.

To bring down the interest-bearing debt to Nov. 1 1908—which, as stated, was $897,503,990 on June 30 1908,—we must deduct $250,000 from the Certificates of Indebtedness to reach the total of the interest-bearing debt Nov. 1 1908, which was $897,253,990, or $250,000 less than on June 30. • For later and future details of the debt, see the same as issued every month in the \"Chronicle,\" the first or a later Saturday.

On March 12 1879 the issue of these certificates and their exchange into 4% bonds were authorized; the certificates were to draw 4% interest from April 1 1879 and were convertible in sums of $50 or its multiples. The amount Issued at the close of the fiscal year (June 30 1879) was $39,308,110, but they had been converted so rapidly that there were outstanding at that date only $12,848,210. On Oct. 31 1879 the entire authorization had been reached, the maximum amount of the issue being $40.012 750.

In a message to Congress under date of February 8 1895 (published in the \"Chronicle\" February 9 1895, page 244), President Cleveland stated in substance that in pursuance of Section 3700 of the Revised Statutes meet have this day been concluded whereby bonds authorized under the Act of July 14 1875, payable in coin at the pleasure the details of an an-angof the United States after the first day of Feb. 1925, with Interest at the rate of 4% per annum, to the amount of $62,315,400, are to be Issued for the of gold coin amounting to a sum slightly In excess of $65,000,000, to be delivered to the Treasury of the United States, which sum added topurchase the gold now held in our reserve will so restore such reserve as to make it amount to something more than $100,000,000. Such a premium Is to be allowed to the Government upon the bonds as to fix the rate of interest upon tile amount of gold realized at 3 per annum. At least one-half of the gold to be obtained is to be supplied from abroad. Section 3700 of the revised Statutes is as follows: \"Sec. 3700. The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase coin with any of tile bonds or notes of the United States authorized by law at such rates and upon such terms as he may deem most advantageous to the public interest.\" For a construction of the \"Refunding Act of 1870\" and of the 'Resumption Act of 1875,\" see \"Chronicle.\" February 18 1893, page 265. The Issue in February 1896 was an ordinary offering, open to all bidders, of $100,000,000 of the same bonds in Limb of maturity, same in rate of interest and time of interest payments.

UNITED STATES DEBT. 10 subsequent In April 1895 we gave a table showing the debt of the United States on the first day of July 1856, and every this occasion to begin our statement with year. It is not necessary to repeat all those figures. We have determined onthe record sufficiently far back to show the 1878, as that year antedates all of the issues now outstanding, and yet carries advantage, nature and extent of the Government securities when the refunding operations of that period began. It has the too of giving separate and distinct each issue of bonds now outstanding. The statement is subjoined.
