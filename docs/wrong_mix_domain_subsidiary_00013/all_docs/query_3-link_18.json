        "text": "Railroads became dominant in Connecticut during the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1837, just eight years after the first locomotive - the Stourbridge Lion - was brought to the United States from England, the first railroad line in Connecticut was completed, connecting Stonington with Providence, Rhode Island, with connecting steamboats to New York City. Industrial growth and railroad development fueled each other during this period. Suddenly, manufacturers whose plants were close to raw materials and sources of cheap water power had easy, all-weather access to major markets. Investors in railroad companies were primarily wealthy bankers and industrialists, such as New Haven's James Brewater and Joseph Sheffield, but many municipalities purchased stocks in these companies as well. The New York & New Haven Railroad opened in 1848 linking Connecticut to New York by 1849. In the north-south direction, the most important line was the Hartford & New Haven line, which opened in 1839 between the state's alternating capitals. Five years later the line was extended north to Springfield, Massachusetts. Rails ran up the Housatonic River Valley by 1842. The Naugatuck Valley was connected to the sea at Bridgeport by 1849, and Norwalk and Danbury were connected in the early 1850s. Rail lines along the coast opened between New London and New Haven in 1850, and between New London and Stonington in 1858. The trains still had to use a ferry to cross the Thames River until a drawbridge was completed in 1889. Railroad's prominence in transportation seemed assured. In 1840, there were 102 miles of track in the state, and by 1850, there were 402 miles of track. By the Civil War, with 601 miles of track, Connecticut had the highest railroad density in the country. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was the most prosperous enterprise in New England. In 1872, the Hartford & New Haven merged with the New York & New Haven in 1872 to become the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (New Haven Railroad). Regulation of railroads in Connecticut came on the heels of Connecticut's first major train disaster in 1853. A New Haven Railroad engineer ignored an open drawbridge signal at Norwalk. The train, carrying many doctors returning from an American Medical Association conference, careened into the river, killing over 20 people. As a result, the first railroad commission was formed that year to ensure public safety on the railroad. Authorized by an \"Act to Prevent Injuries and Destruction of Life Upon Railroads by Railroad Trains\", the Board of Railroad Commissioners was charged with inspecting railways in the state, regulating speeds, standardizing signals, and implementing directives for safer operations. By 1900, virtually every town in the state was connected by rail. Rail expansion continued until 1920, when there were 938 miles of track in the state. This boom in rail transportation was not unique to Connecticut. After the Civil War, the whole country became committed to the railroad as the basis for a national transportation system. The Transcontinental Railroad was completed on May 10, 1869, with the driving of the Golden Spike at Promontory, Utah, and major land subsidies amounting to over 130 million acres were granted to fledgling rail companies to stimulate the construction of new rail lines into the uncharted western territories. By the 1870s, the unrestrained monopoly power of the railroad industry began to be felt by farmers, particularly in rural areas, who had no choice but to pay high prices for shipping their goods into the cities. Widespread complaints brought about government involvement, and in 1887, the United States Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to oversee the railroads. Basically a measure to satisfy the \"populous clamor\", this legislation had no real teeth because it did not establish rate guidelines or enforcement provisions, although it apparently did result in lower rates to some degree through the requirement for rail companies to post their rates publicly. More than anything, the creation of the ICC was a harbinger of government control that would later become integral in the railroad industry.\n\nWhile rural areas were the usual targets of highway development, the cities of the rapidly growing industrial northeast needed means for moving large numbers of people efficiently. In addition to railroads, the mass transportation of the mid-1850s consisted of horse-drawn conveyances and stagecoaches. In the early 1860s, street railways -- rails laid down in city streets -- became increasingly common. Street railways maximized the efficiency of moving people; a team of horses that might draw 10-12 passengers in an omnibus over dirt or cobble streets could haul as many as 75 people in a car on steel rails. Street railways, also known as horse-car lines, connected factories, shopping areas, and workers' homes. In the early days of the steam railroads, railway coaches were also used to shuttle passengers out of the city to their travel connection, since the steam railroad terminals were often located outside the cities. By the 1870s, many cities were crossed by a network of street railways. The tremendous costs of maintaining horses for this totally horse-powered transportation network prompted the search for mechanical substitutes. Cable-driven systems came into popular use between 1877 and 1890. In the early 1890s, trolley-equipped cars driven by electric propulsion, first demonstrated at the Toronto Exposition of 1885, quickly became the first choice in the street-railway industry, replacing horses at an astounding rate. In the United States in 1890, there were four and a half times more miles of horse-car lines than electric lines; by 1894, the numbers were reversed, with electric mileage exceeding horse-car mileage by a factor of five and a half."
