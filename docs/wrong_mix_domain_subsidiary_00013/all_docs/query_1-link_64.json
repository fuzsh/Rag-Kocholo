We are inclined to the latter view. It is, of course, conceivable that the movement, if continued, may proceed beyond reasonable limits; but thus far there appears to be little or no warrant for the drawing of unfavorable conclusions from the continued expansion in the output of municipal bonds. As pointed out by us in previous years, there doubtless has been a tendency toward prodigality on the part of municipal governments, just as there has been in private life; but at bottom the growth in the demands upon the money market by our cities and towns is to be ascribed to the same causes and circumstances that are responsible for the constant new capital requirements of our railroads and industrial concerns, namely the expansion and development of the country. The rise of new communities, with the increase in population everywhere, explains in the main why the yearly aggregate of municipal bond issues has so greatly expanded. Careful and detailed examination of the statistics which we have compiled at the expenditure of so much labor and trouble bears out these conclusions. It is in the newer parts of the country, where most development is going on, that the increase in the output of new issues is most noteworthy. To emphasize this point and to confirm the correctness of the view taken, we present the following table, which shows the distribution of the bond sales for the last ten years among the •different geographical divisions of the country. I VoL. Lxxxxiv. 642,516,in the other case it has been no less ,han $103,462,184. Another feature deserves emphasizing,' because it tends to confirm still further the conclusions announced. The great increase in the grand aggregate of the sales for the whole country is taking place in the face of diminishing contributions from some of our chief cities. We referred to this feature a year ago, and now that we have the record for still another year the evidence in support of the statement is yet stronger. Take the case of New York City, for illustration. There was but one public sale of New York City bonds, namely $60,000,000, sold in January 1911, while $1,790,441 more was sold through the course of the year to the city's sinking funds, making altogether $61,790,442. This compares with $63,022,795 bonds in 1910, of which $13,022,795 was sinking fund takings; with $72,566,074 in 1909, of which the sinking fund takings were $10,066,074; with $73,340,859 in 1908, including sales to the sinking fund of only $3,641,399, and with $79,100,195 in 1907, including $3,289,195 by the sinking funds. Philadelphia, as it happens, put out $13,450,000 of new bonds in 1911, against $5,000,000 in 1910,$8,739,700 in 1909 and $19,375,000 in 1908, and Jersey City issued $8,033,254 in 1911 (mainly to pay the cost of its water-works system), against $130,000 in 1910 and $1,600,000 in 1909, while Newark placed $3,450,000 in the latest year, against $1,664,700 in 1910.

This much smaller than it was only a few years back.

In other words, in the makes it evident that the popularity of municipal bond one case the increase in the seven years has been $42,- issues must be ascribed largely to the better return they yield to the investor. If the comparison is extended back ten years, the change in that respect is found to be really quite remarkable. Excluding New York City's sinking fund takings, which are usually 3% issues, but furnish no criterion of market conditions, we find that back in 1901 $19,971,249 of the new bonds, or 14.25% of the whole, were 3s, and no less than $68,693,268, or 49%, were then 34s. In other words, out of a total of $140,185,499 of new bonds sold in that year, no less than $88,664,517, or 6331%,were 3s and 33s. In 1911, on the other hand, with total bond sales (excluding New York City sinking fund takings) of $395,069,205, the 3s were only $7,000, and even the 3s no more than $6,682,900. The 3s and 33's together formed but 1.69% of the whole. The 4s aggregated $126,914,229, but as this constituted only 32.12% of the whole, and the 3s and 3s together but 1.69%, it is evident that two-thirds of the new bond issues of 1911 bore interest rates in excess of 4%.

No less than $78,038,899, or 19.75% of the whole,falls under this designation in 1911. The reason is that at a few points 434% bond issues have sprung into prominence in recent years. New York City put out $60,000,000 bonds at that rate in 1911, Jersey City $1,161,000, Pittsburgh put out $1,510,000 and Cleveland put out $1,938,000. This is a rate which until a short time ago was unknown, and even now must be considered an unusual rate. Owing to the fact that New York City is obliged to come into the market for such extensive borrowings from year to year, the interest rate which the city is obliged to pay is steadily rising. It sold the present month (May 1912) $65,000,000 434s at an average price of 100.747, making the cost of the money to the city 4.21%. Last year it sold $60,000,000 41/0 at an average price of 100.90, making the cost of the money then 4.207%. The $50,000,000 434s disposed of in March 1910 brought an average price of 101.28, making the cost per annum then only 4.155%, and if we went back further, the contrast would become still more marked. To complete our analysis of the bond disposals of 1911, we furnish herewith a comparison of the new bond issues according to the purposes for which they were used or created. The bulk of the new issues each year is for five main purposes, namely, water, streets and bridges, sewerage and drainage, schools and school buildings, and public buildings generally. The total under the five heads combined amounts for 1911 to $282,960,420, which compares with $224,268,652 for 1910, $235,358,294 for 1909, $226,434,801 for 1908, $167,659,934 for 1907 and $136,034,202 for 1906. p, 1311. i PC of Total '1910. $ PC of Total - PC o/j 1909.

In explanation it should be said that this item comprises mainly bonds issued for special purposes, like the Canal bonds of New York State (of which $20,000,000 were put out in 1911), and the dock bonds and the rapid transit bonds of this city-purposes of not sufficiently common occurrence to warrant our providing an extra column for the same in our full-page compilation. A footnote to the detailed table on the following page gives the leading items that go to make U p the \"miscellaneous\" column. In conclusion, we will reiterate what we have said in previous years, namely that our figures deal only with issues of a permanent character-such as, by their nature, constitute a real addition to the debts of the municipalities. We rigidly exclude floating-debt obligations and everything of a temporary nature, and we are careful also to avoid duplication or the inclusion of loans that do not belong in the footings. As the best explanation of our reasons for excluding floating debt obligations, we may refer to the case of this city, which during 1911 issued no less than $176,394,693 of temporary obligations in anticipation of taxes, but redeemed $189,992,065 of the same class of obligations, and also issued $24,295,579 of corporate stock notes (a new form of obligation), which will be retired out of the proceeds of this month's bond sales. We also omit from our totals the bond issues made by Canadian municipalities and by our Island Possessions. In order that the reader may know what the grand aggregate of the sales for the twelve months would be, with all these various items included, we will say that the total in that event would be over $716,000,000. The actual municipal bond sales for the twelve months within the territorial limits of the United States were, we have seen, $396,859,646; the temporary loans reached $254,901,797; sales by Canadian municipalities were $45,657,122, and general fund bonds of New York City $17,500,000, besides which Hawaii sold $1,500,000 bonds and the city of Cebu (Philippine Islands) $125,000, making a grand total of $716,543,565. In addition the United States floated $50,000,000 Panama Canal 3s without the circulation privilege. A full-page tabular presentation of the sales of a permanent character within the limits of the United States for the late year appears on the following page. In giving this compilation, we are continuing a practice begun by us with the bond transactions of 1901. The table presents the details of the sales in very elaborate form, showing the disposals for each State and for each leading geographical group or division, and indicates also the purposes for which the bonds were issued and the amounts putout at the several rates of interest, besides apportioning the issues among the different civil divistons by whose authority they were createdwhether Statqcounty,Imunicipality or school district.

MAY, 1912.] 9 UNITED STATES DEBT. United States Debt and Its History. The following is a statement of the debt of the United States past and present. To add to its usefulness we give references to the laws authorizing each of the issues of bonds outstanding to-day, and likewise,so far as we deem it needful, citations from those laws. All our figures, except when otherwise noted, represent the status at the close of business June 30 or the beginning of business on July 1 of each fiscal year. To conform to that feature and yet furnish information through which any reader can always have the data for a correct exhibit of the debt situation at any past or future day, and make an accurate comparison with previous years, we present,first, the details as they stood at the close of the last fiscal year ending June 30 1911; second, the changes in those details since June 30 1911 down to May 1 1912; third, the items of interest-bearing debt, &c., at the beginning of each fiscal year since July 1 1878;fourth, we publish in the \"Chronicle\" every month—usually the first or second Saturday—the full detailed Government statement of the debt as reported by the Treasurer on the last day of the previous month; some months lack of space forces us to delay the publication to a later week. With these data at his command, it would seem as if any inquirer could satisfy himself fully with reference to every point which might become of importance for him to know respecting the United States debt.

The amount issued at the close of the fiscal year (June 30 1879) was $39,308,110. but they had been converted so rapidly that there were outstanding at that date only $12.848,210. On Oct. 31 1879 the entire authorize j amount had been reached, the maximum of the issue being $40,012,750. Of these there were still outstanding on May 1 1912 a total of $14,110, Included in debt bearing no interest. \"LOAN OF 1925.\"—(Column 9.) Sales of bonds included under this designation were effected (I) in February 1895 to the amount of $62,315,400. and (2) In February 1896 to the amount of $100,000,000. In a message to Congress under date of February 8 1895 (published In the \"Chronicle\" February 9 1895, page 244), President Cleveland stated In substance that in pursuance of Section 3700 of the Revised Statutes,the details of an arrangement have this day been concluded whereby bonds authorized understhe Act of July14 1875,payable in coin at the pleasure of the United States after the first day of Feb. 1925. with interest at the rate of 4% per annum, to the amount of $62,315.400, are to be issued for the purchase of gold coin amounting to a sum slightly in excess of $65,000,000, to be delivered to the Treasury of the United States, which sum added to the gold now held in our reserve will so restore such reserve as to make it amount to something more than $100.000,000. Such a premium is to be allowed to the Government upon the bonds as to fix the rate of interest upon the amount of gold realized at 3 q% per annum. At least one-half of the gold to be obtained is to be supplied from abroad. Section 3700 of the revised Statutes is as follows: \"Sec. 3700. The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase coin with any of the bonds or notes of the United States authorized by law at such rates and upon such terms as he may deem most advantageous to the public interest.\" For a construction of the \"Refunding Act of 1870\" and of the \"Resumption Act of 1875.\" see \"Chronicle.\" February 18 1893, page 265. The issue in February 1896 was an ordinary offering, open to all bidders, of $100,000,000 of the same bonds as the foregoing—same in date, same In time of maturity, same in rate of interest and time of Interest payments. Consequently both issues are called the \"Loan of 1925,\" of which there are outstanding $118,489,900.\" \"LOAN OF 1904.\"—(Column 6.) The Act of January 14 1875 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to use any surplus revenues from time to time in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and to issue, sell, dispose of, at not less than par in coin, either of the descriptions of bonds of the United States described in the Act of July 14 1870,for the purpose of redeeming on and after January 1 1879. In coin, at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at New York, the outstanciing legal-tender notes when presented in sums of not less than fifty dollars. Under this authorization, and for the Purposes mentioned, there were issued in Feb. 1894, payable in 10 years. $50,000,000 of 5%s and In Nov. 1894 there were issued $50,000,000 more for similar bonds for same purpose. The bonds matured Feb. 2 1904, and the amount outstanding May 1 ($13,350) Is included on that date in \"debt on which Interest has ceased.\" \"PANAMA CANAL LOAN.\"—(Column 2). The Act of June 28 1902. Section 8,supplemented by the Act of Dec. 21 1905 (for copy of the sections referred to. see \"Chronicle\" July 7 1906, page 12), authorizes the issue of $130.000,000 of coupon or registered 2% bonds of the United States, or as much thereof as may be necessary, in denominations of $20 or some multiple of that sum, redeemable in gold coin at the pleasure of the United States after ten years from the date of issue—$84,631,980 of said bonds have been Issued, all of which are now outstanding. They bear date Aug. 1 1906 and Nov. 1 1908, but Interest began Nov. 1 1907 and Feb. 11909. \"PANAMA CANAL LOAN.\"—(Column 5.)

For further details see circular of Secretary Cortelyou In \"Chronicle,\" Nov. 23 1907, page 1311— the certificates have all been retired. In April 1895 we gave a table showing the debt of the United States on the first day of July 1856, and every subsequent year. It is not necessary to repeat all those figures. We have determined on this occasion to begin our statement with 1878, as that year antedates all of the issues now outstanding, and yet carries the record sufficiently far back to show the nature and extent of the Government securities when the refunding operations of that period began. It has the advantage, too, of giving separate and distinct each issue of bonds now outstanding. The statement is subjoined.

PACIFIC RAILROAD DEBT.—One other class of bonded debt must be referred to which has never been included in the total of Government debt—we mean the Pacific Railroad subsidy debt.

This section follows: SECTION 14. The credit of the State shall not be directly or indirectly loaned in any case. The Legislature shall not create any debt or debts, liability or liabilities, on behalf of the State, which shall singly or in the aggregate, with previous debts and liabilities hereafter incurred, at any one time exceed $300,000, except to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or for purposes of war; but this amendment shall not be construed to refer to any money that has been, or may be, deposited with this State by the Government of the United States, or to any fund which the State shall hold in trust for any Indian tribe. (In September 1912 a vote will be taken on constitutional amendments authorizing the State to issue not exceeding $2,000,000 highway bonds. V. 94, p. 1397.1 MUNICIPAL.—At an election held Sept. 11 1911 the voters adopted an amendment to Article XXII. of the constitution, increasing the debt limit of cities of 40,000 or more (which concerns Portland alone) from 5% to 73,6% of the assessed valuation. We print Article XXII. below, Italicizing and placing in brackets the words eliminated. Article XXII. Limitation of Municipal Indebtedness. No city or town having less than forty thousand inhabitants, according to the last Census Pages 19 to 34 Pages 34 to 35 Pages 35 to 40 taken by the United States,shall hereafter create any debt or liability which, singly or in the aggregate, with previous debts or liabilities, shall exceed five per centum of the last regular valuation of said city or town, provided, however, that cities having a population of forty thousand or more, according to the last Census taken by the United States, may create a debt or liability which, singly or in the aggregate, with previous debts or liabilities, shall equal seven and one-half per centum of the last regular valuation of said city, that cities of forty thousand inhabitants or over may, by a vote of their city government, increase the present rate of five per centum by one-fourth of one per centum in any one municipal year, until, in not less than ten years, the maximum rate of seven and one-half per centum is reached, that any city failing to take the increase in any one municipal year, then the increase for that year is lost and no increase can be made until the next year, as provided above; and provided, further, that the adoption of this Article shall not be construed as applying to any fund received in trust by the said city or town, nor to any loan for the purpose of renewing existing loans or for war; or to temporary loans to be paid out of money raised by taxation during the year in which they were [are] made. EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION.—The Legislature of 1909 approved an Act exempting from taxation all bonds issued after Feb. 1 1909 by the State or any county municipality, village, corporation or water district therein. Banks and trust companies holding such securities are allowed to deduct the same from the assessment of their shares.
