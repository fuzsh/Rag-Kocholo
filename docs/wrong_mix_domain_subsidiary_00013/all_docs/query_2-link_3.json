        "text": "Oracle University provides the training material needed to help Oracle’s 130,000 employees—as well as customers and partners—leverage the company’s broad and ever-changing portfolio of cloud infrastructure and business applications. As employees access these learning resources, they all bring their own unique geography, skill sets, roles, and experiences.\n\nMaking this task especially challenging, Oracle updates its cloud applications quarterly. These releases require ongoing training on the new functionality and capabilities. In effect, the Oracle University team must keep pace with the company’s research and development (R&D) and its constant innovation for all cloud applications and infrastructure.\n\nTo educate employees, the Oracle University team used to rely on a variety of disparate and disconnected digital learning tools and processes, including videos and other self-created content accessed through various portals and applications.\n\nCreating various internal content libraries for a worldwide audience was expensive and time consuming. Additionally, because employees had to rely on these various channels, they lacked one central source for comprehensive guidance and reliable data and policy information. And given the continuous release processes, the content became outdated at least every four months, if not sooner.\n\nOracle University decided to move to a centralized, intelligent, and robust learning platform that could cater to the needs of its various employees around the world.\n\nThe team selected the Oracle Guided Learning platform, which the company’s own technology professionals develop to educate end users in Oracle Cloud technologies. The Oracle University team realized that the constant demand from Oracle employees for personalized learning—tailored to specific job roles—required a sophisticated, cloud-based, and flexible learning platform. The Guided Learning platform accelerates the learning process to help employees globally leverage benefits from updates and share them with customers and partners. Also, internal users needed to learn about the applications directly from Oracle experts.\n\nOracle Guided Learning supports education and coaching for all types of roles in various specialties, such as finance, operations, and management. It also offers contextual guidance for intricate tasks and specific organizational processes.\n\nTo broaden the platform’s capabilities, the Oracle University team decided to integrate the learning solution with Oracle Talent Management, part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), which enables career management from sourcing to succession.\n\nOracle University’s implementation of an integrated Oracle Guided Learning and Oracle Talent Management platform offered a variety of both quantitative and qualitative benefits. For example, the system proactively shares key information within Oracle application workflows when a user might need it. This capability reduced service requests from employees by 70%, saving considerable time and money. The platform also allowed the Oracle University team to cut the cost and time required to develop quarterly learning content by 50%.\n\nBecause Guided Learning automatically launches process guides or shares smart tips and change communications, it accelerates employee productivity by enabling fast adaption to workflow or policy modifications. The application empowers users in their career development and improves employee performance management across the company.\n\nThe centralized solution provides access to all employees within Oracle globally across regions, roles, and time zones. In one year, the Oracle University team simultaneously trained and certified 86,000 employees on the company’s most current cloud technologies. The team did this across 120 worldwide locations, with zero travel required, preparing people who often had little previous knowledge or training on these updates.\n\nOracle Guided Learning allows employees to better understand the quarterly innovations for Oracle products and services. These include the functional enhancements that help them in their specific jobs and regions, as well as the underlying architectural improvements such as increased performance, availability, scalability, and security.\n\nThe Oracle Guided Learning and Oracle Talent Management platform reduces implementation and upgrade risks across the company, while enabling each business unit to get the most value from new releases. The project success is reflected in the recent annual employee survey, which showed increased scores for knowledge and morale."
