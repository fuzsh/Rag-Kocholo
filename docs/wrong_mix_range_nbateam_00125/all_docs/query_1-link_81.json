        "text": "Published February 2, 2014 3:00pm\n\nGuard Jamal Crawford scored 27 points and forward Blake Griffin added 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Los Angeles Clippers blew past the Utah Jazz 102-87 on Saturday night (Sunday, PHL time) at the Staples Center.\n\nThe Pacific Division-leading Clippers (34-16) won for the fifth time in their last six games. Utah (16-31) lost for the second time in as many nights and dropped its fourth in the past six outings. The Jazz fell to the Golden State Warriors 95-90 on Friday night (Saturday, PHL time) at Utah.\n\nCenter DeAndre Jordan grabbed 14 rebounds, blocked three shots and chipped in 10 points for the Clippers. Los Angeles point guard Darren Collison had 11 points and six assists.\n\nCenter Enes Kanter paced the Jazz with 23 points and 14 rebounds, including eight on the offensive end. Forward Richard Jefferson finished with 19 points and guard Gordon Hayward had 15.\n\nLos Angeles used a third-quarter spurt to pull away from the Jazz as it improved to 20-3 at home. The Clippers also stretched their winning streak over Utah to eight in a row.\n\nThe lead changed hands nine times in a sluggish first half as the two clubs creeped to the break tied at 42. Utah managed to shoot just 41 percent from the floor (16 of 39) compared with 51.5 percent (17 of 33) for the Clippers, but the Jazz converted six three-pointers and Los Angeles failed to hit any. The Clippers also missed nine of their 17 free throws.\n\nOverall, the Clippers shot 51.4 percent from the field (38-of-74) to 35.8 percent (29-of-81) for the Jazz.\n\nUtah led 58-55 midway through the third quarter when the Clippers went on 16-2 run after a dunk by Jordan gave them a 71-60 lead with 1:22 left. Two field goals by Kanter in the final seven minutes of the quarter were the only baskets for the Jazz as the Clippers took a 76-65 heading into the fourth quarter. - Reuters"
