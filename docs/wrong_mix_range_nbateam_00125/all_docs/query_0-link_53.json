        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The box score barely made Clippers forward Jamal Crawford flinch.\n\nInstead of worrying about his combined 5-of-24 mark from the field, including 0 for 9 from 3-point range, in the Clippers’ first two playoff games against the Utah Jazz, Crawford was more concerned about another line in the box score. He seemed in high spirits after the Clippers secured a 99-91 Game 2 victory on Tuesday at Staples Center to even the best-of-7 series, 1-1.\n\n“I’m encouraged,” said Crawford, who had 10 points while going 3 for 12 from the field and 0 for 5 from 3-point range in 24 minutes off the bench in Game 2. “At the end of the day, it’s about winning and losing. I would hate to have 30 (points) and us lose. It’s just about us winning.”\n\nCrawford also noted correctly he had taken four half-court heaves before the end of quarters that hit iron. Crawford has spent most of his 17-year NBA career scoring in bunches and winning three NBA Sixth Man of the Year awards. During rare off nights, Crawford does not become discouraged because he is confident he will return to normal soon.\n\n“For me, it’s not about percentage,” Crawford said. “The only thing that matters is trying to win. As long as the good shots are there, I’m going to continue to take them and continue to be aggressive and go from there.”\n\nClippers coach Doc Rivers said he felt the same way. Despite Crawford scoring eight points on 4-of-12 shooting in the Game 1 loss, Rivers said he “loved his shots” before noting Crawford took three shots “that went in and out.” Rivers can rely on Crawford’s extensive body of work to predict that probably will not happen frequently.\n\n“He looked comfortable and I thought his rhythm was great,” Rivers said. “Those are the ones from Jamal’s standpoint, he knows he played well. The ball just didn’t go in.”\n\nMeanwhile, Crawford had the unenviable assignment of trying to defend Utah forward Joe Johnson on his game-winning play in Game 1.\n\n“If you’re scared to fail, you can’t play in fear,” Crawford said. “If you’re scared to fail, you’re already done, to be honest with you. You have to just go and leave it all out there. Mistakes are going to happen.”\n\nINJURY UPDATE\n\nClippers guard Austin Rivers wishes he was back on the court already. But Rivers said the training staff told him he can return no sooner than Game 4 in Salt Lake City on Sunday after missing the last six regular-season games and first two playoff games with a strained left hamstring.\n\nAfter completing running drills during Monday’s practice, Rivers did some work on a weight-bearing treadmill and completed a shooting workout on Tuesday. The Clippers plan to increase his workload for Wednesday, though not enough to participate in a full-court practice.\n\nDefensively, Doc Rivers said “we miss him a lot.” While Doc Rivers thought Austin’s availability in Game 1 would have helped him lower Blake Griffin’s minutes, the Clippers’ coach also lamented his team’s inability to attack the basket without Austin’s presence.\n\n“Austin can do it on a live dribble and do it,” Doc Rivers said. “Now we have to do it through ball screens and movement.”\n\nWISHFUL THINKING\n\nThe Jazz isn’t the only team that wishes Rudy Gobert was back on the court after the center suffered a bone bruise and hyperextension in his left knee only 11 seconds into Game 1. Apparently, the Clippers miss Gobert, too, considering the Jazz won Game 1 without him.\n\n“With him being out, you’d think it would be easier, but it really wasn’t,” Clippers guard Raymond Felton said. “It’s kind of hard to play against a team when they lose one of their top guys, because everybody else steps up and plays at another level. I almost want him to come back and play.”\n\nThough Gobert has moved without crutches since Monday, he has yet to practice.\n\n“I don’t think we can anticipate having him until we know where we’re at,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “It’s hard to say right now.”\n\nLENDING PERSPECTIVE\n\nAs he struggled to find his way early in his NBA career, Clippers and former Lakers forward Wesley Johnson often leaned on his former agent, Rob Pelinka, for encouragement and honest feedback. With Pelinka now the Lakers’ general manager, Johnson dismissed any potential learning curve he might face in changing professions.\n\n“It’s his first year, but he’ll definitely learn as he continues to go,” Johnson said. “He’ll welcome everything with open arms. Knowing him, he’s going to be good.”\n\nWhy?\n\n“He’s been around basketball his whole life,” Johnson said of Pelinka. “He knows the game and has been in that position to work with with front offices. It suited him.”\n\n*Staff writer Bill Oram contributed to this report"
