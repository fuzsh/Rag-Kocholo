        "text": "TNT has found Dwyane Wade’s replacement.\n\nTNT has struck a deal with longtime guard Jamal Crawford to join the network’s NBA studio show on Tuesday nights this season, according to the New York Post’s Andrew Marchand.\n\nCrawford will be in studio on Tuesday nights this season with Shaquille O’Neal, Candace Parker and Adam Lefkoe.\n\nCrawford spent two decades in the league with nine different teams, including the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers. He averaged 14.6 points and 3.4 assists in 1,327 games and scored more than 19,400 total points — which is 61st on the league’s all-time scoring list.\n\nCrawford most recently played for the Brooklyn Nets in 2019, but he appeared in just one game. The three-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner officially retired earlier this year.\n\nWade joined TNT in 2019 and spent three seasons as an analyst on its studio shows. TNT reportedly offered him a new contract this past offseason, but he declined in order to pursue other business interests. The longtime Miami Heat star purchased an ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021."
