Crawford knows how good guys like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins are and took notice when Minnesota added Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson and Jeff Teague this offseason.\n\n“I’m like, ‘They’re for real,’” Crawford said, “and I just felt with my role and how my fit was, it just made sense on every level.\n\n“Obviously, I could’ve went to a championship contender or a team that was right there already, but I wanted to really just embrace the journey.”\n\nCrawford wants to be there for those times when Minnesota is on the road, playing its fourth game in five days and has to “find a way to win.” His appreciates those games, those moments of growth. While Minnesota went from a young, inexperienced team to a group that’s getting older each day, Crawford sees a chance to grow with the core the Wolves have assembled.\n\nA quick look at Crawford’s age would suggest he’s done growing. He’s 37. He’s spent 17 years in the NBA. But, to Crawford, those numbers don’t mean much.\n\n“I know my age is one thing, but my actual play is something else to me,” he said. “I always joke that I’m 47 mentally and 27 physically, so I guess that’s how they came up with 37. Other than that, I just really felt like I could grow with the team and feel like a leadership role would be there, not only with my voice, but also on and off the court.”\n\nCrawford said he’s in a “unique position,” because many guys his age have hit a point where their play has fallen off and their role is to sit on the end of the bench be good locker room guys.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with that,” he said, “because everybody will probably get there at some point.”\n\nBut Crawford doesn’t feel like he’s close to that stage.\n\n“I just know myself, I know my body, I know how I’ve prepared and I know how to take care of myself,” said Crawford, while on his way to his Seattle summer league he plays in each week. “I just know shape has no age. When you’re feeling good, you’re in shape, if you saw me play, you wouldn’t say he’s 37. You may say he’s mid-20s or whatever. That’s just a number, really.”\n\nEven at 37, Crawford is intent on continuing to improve his game, one of the reasons he’s excited to play for Tom Thibodeau, despite the coach’s reputation as a relentless pusher who barks from the opening tip to the final buzzer.\n\n“You hear his voice, you can hear it through the TV, but I don’t look at that as glass half-empty, I look at it as half-full,” Crawford said. “Because, you know what, he’s going to push me outside my comfort zone, and if I’m open to that, then I’ll be a better player, because I’ll be willing to grow as a player. And if I’m a better player, then I’ll be better for the Minnesota Timberwolves. I think they all correlate and I think he’ll help my game grow and continue to grow, and, for me, that’s exciting.”\n\nThose who believe Crawford is on the slide point to his slipping scoring averages over the past couple seasons. Crawford said that’s a product of his role. The Clippers added more scorers off the bench the last couple seasons, and Crawford’s minutes and shot attempts were affected.\n\n“It all correlated,” Crawford said. “You can’t say, ‘Oh, he’s a good team player by sacrificing,’ then on the other end say, ‘Oh, his numbers dipped.’ Well obviously it dipped if I’m sacrificing some of my game.”\n\nCrawford has proven he can still turn it on when needed. When things weren’t going well for the Clippers’ second unit mid-way through the 2015-16 season, Crawford said coach Doc Rivers asked him to be more aggressive. Crawford went on a tear down the stretch, which resulted in him winning his third Sixth Man of the Year award.\n\n“He’s had a lot of big games. If you go through his game log from last season, you see that he’s had big games against a lot of really good teams, and it doesn’t take him much to get going, and that’s the way he’s always been,” Thibodeau said last week. “I know when we’ve played against him, you always worry about when he comes in and hits those first two shots, you could be in trouble.”\n\nIn that way, Crawford is the prototypical bench scorer, capable of providing points in bunches. Crawford’s name is now the reference when teams talk about needing a scoring punch off the bench. That’s something he takes pride in, though he didn’t start coming off the bench until he went to Atlanta in 2009. The role seems like the perfect fit for Crawford.\n\nHe should get to fully immerse himself in it again in Minnesota. While the Timberwolves continue to add pieces to provide much improved depth, Crawford should easily be their top reserve scorer and will certainly be the offensive focal point of the second unit.\n\n“To hear that I could be back in that feature role off the bench, I’m really, really excited,” Crawford said. “And that doesn’t mean I take every shot or anything like that, it just means you do what you do best.”\n\nWhatever it takes to win, Crawford said.\n\n“It’s weird, in my mind, in my heart, I know how this season is going to play out for our team,” he said. “I just feel really, really good about what’s going on moving forward.”\n\nOriginally Published: July 15, 2017 at 5:23 p.m."
