        "text": "Jamal Crawford was used to going to new teams and trying to replace big stars during his NBA career. He is at it again, The Post has learned.\n\nCrawford is set to succeed Dwyane Wade on TNT’s Tuesday night NBA set, which features Shaquille O’Neal, Candace Parker and host Adam Lefkoe, according to sources.\n\nCrawford, 42, played with nine teams, including the Knicks, during his 20-year career. He won three Sixth Man of the Year Awards and his 19,419 points are 61st all-time. He was respected and well-liked around the NBA.\n\nWade chose to leave TNT to concentrate on his other business, which includes part ownership of the Jazz.\n\nTNT declined comment.\n\nThe NBA studio jobs at TNT are highly sought after, as “Inside the NBA” is considered by many to be the best pregame and postgame show in sports media history. It features Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, O’Neal and host Ernie Johnson. That group does the biggest events, as well as Thursdays during TNT’s regular-season coverage.\n\nClicker Book Club"
