        "text": "By going 5-for-8 from 3-point range in Monday’s 113-92 victory at Charlotte, Clippers sixth-man Jamal Crawford moved into 10th-place all-time in made 3-point baskets with 1,723, surpassing Dale Ellis, who had 1,719.\n\nAfterward, the humble Crawford — a Seattle native — recalled watching one particular performance by Ellis, who spent six-plus of his 17 seasons in the NBA with the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\n“I was at a game in Seattle when he (Ellis) hit nine 3s,” said Crawford, whose team plays at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at Detroit (on Prime Ticket). “To me, I’m not in that level of shooting. So to hear those names, it’s unbelievable. Last year I passed Steve Nash.”\n\nThe Lakers’ Nash is 12th with 1,685.\n\nCrawford, 34, might be right about not being at Ellis’ level, though. Ellis, who retired in 2000, had a career 3-point shooting percentage of 40.3. Crawford, in his 15th season, has a career percentage of 35.1.\n\nCrawford intimated he didn’t want to get too caught up in the accomplishment.\n\n“I don’t know, I would honestly have to think about it,” he said. “I’m trying to stay in the moment and then one day when it’s over, I can sit back and look at it.”\n\nChris Paul passes Jerry West\n\nPoint guard Chris Paul had a season-high 15 assists Monday, passing former Lakers star Jerry West for 25th on the all-time assists list with 6,241; West had 6,238.\n\nThe Clippers made 51 percent (45 of 88) percent of their shots Monday, and a terrific 46.9 percent (15 of 32) from 3-point range.\n\nBut Paul didn’t want to take any credit for the way the team shot.\n\n“We just made shots; I think the bigs did a great job of rolling,” Paul said. “When you see J.J. and the rest of the guys get open 3s, it’s not because I did anything special, it’s because our bigs rolled.”\n\nRivers expects Detroit’s best\n\nClippers coach Doc Rivers hinted to reporters that just because this next game at Detroit will come against a team that was just 3-10 ahead of its game Tuesday at Milwaukee and sitting next-to-last in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons won’t be a tough nut to crack.\n\n“Everyone is gunning for every team in the West since we’re all supposedly really good,” Rivers said. “When you’re on the road, it’s always hard to win. I don’t think people appreciate how hard one win is.\n\n“We are just taking this one game at a time and we know Detroit will be ready. We have to be ready.”\n\nThis and that\n\nPoint guard Brandon Jennings led the Pistons in scoring, assists and steals with respective averages of 16.0, 5.8 and 1.5 before Tuesday. Center Andre Drummond was pulling down 11.6 rebounds and blocking 1.5 shots per game with an 8.7 scoring average. … Blake Griffin’s 16 rebounds Monday were a season-high. … After Detroit, the Clippers (8-5) will finish their seven-game road trip — they are 3-1 so far — with games Friday at Houston and Saturday at Utah. … Charlotte (4-11) now has a six-game losing streak. … Clippers small forward Matt Barnes missed Monday’s game with a calf injury and Reggie Bullock started in his place."
