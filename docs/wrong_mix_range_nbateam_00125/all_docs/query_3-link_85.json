        "text": "Jamal Crawford, a three-time winner of NBA Sixth Man of the Year, played 20 professional seasons before officially announcing his retirement.\n\nDuring a recent segment on his show, Jalen Rose argued that Crawford deserves to be in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Rose and former NBA player Matt Barnes both included Crawford as one of the top 5 ball-handlers of all time.\n\nCrawford recently made headlines for his wildly popular Pro-Am league, the CrawsOver. Several notable NBA players, including rookies Paolo Banchero and Chet Holmgren, showed up to play in Seattle. Atlanta’s Trae Young and Dejounte Murray (who had this ridiculous highlight) also participated.\n\nDuring a recent conversation with For The Win, Crawford discussed why his Pro-Am league is so important to him.\n\nHe also touched on predictions for the future of basketball in Seattle, which NBA players are carrying on his legacy, what he has learned while coaching his son’s AAU team, and why he highly recommends wearing Move Insoles.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."
