        "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- University of Michigan men's basketball player Jamal Crawford (Renton, Wash./Rainier Beach HS) has decided to enter his name into the 2000 National Basketball Association Draft. The NBA Draft will take place Wednesday, June 28, in Minneapolis, Minn., at the Target Center. Crawford becomes the 20th underclassman to declare himself eligible for the draft.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCrawford\n\n\"At this time, I would like the opportunity to test the waters and put my name in for the NBA draft,\" said Crawford. \"After talking with several professional teams, it is necessary to look at all my options and see if indeed it would be in my best interest to play in the professional ranks.\n\n\"Today's decision does not close the door on my college career, but it allows me simply to take a look at this opportunity.\"\n\nCrawford will have until June 21 to withdraw from the NBA Draft and remain eligible to play college ball. If an NBA team drafts Crawford, he will immediately lose his collegiate eligibility. If an NBA team does not draft him, Crawford can return to play collegiate basketball by writing a declaration of intent to the Director of Athletics within 30 days after the draft. At any time during this process, if an underclassman signs with an agent, he cannot return to NCAA play.\n\nUnderclassmen have until May 14 to declare for the draft. Those underclassmen who have declared for the draft can attend the Chicago pre-draft camp June 6-9 (if invited) or private workouts leading up to the NBA Draft.\n\n\"We talked to Jamal and hoped he would not enter the draft and stay in Ann Arbor to get ready for the upcoming school year and basketball season,\" said U-M head coach Brian Ellerbe, who stayed in Florida after attending the Big Ten Conference coaches meetings this past weekend in Orlando. \"This is Jamal's decision and we hope that whatever the outcome it turns out best for his family and himself.\"\n\nCrawford played in 17 games and averaged 16.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 33.9 minutes a game for the Wolverines as a freshman. He averaged 4.5 assists on the season and shot 41.2 percent from the field, 32.7 percent on three-pointers and 78.4 percent on free throws.\n\nCrawford Bio Page (PDF: 2 pages, 12 KB)"
