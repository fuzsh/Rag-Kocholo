        "text": "Jamal Crawford hasn’t signed with anyone, yet.\n\nHe can still play in the NBA and help any team on and off the court, but should that team be the Phoenix Suns in 2019-20?\n\nProbably not.\n\nWhile he’d be a contributor and good locker room influence, and be welcomed back with open arms, especially by Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, Crawford deserves a chance to play for a championship in what would be his 20th and perhaps final NBA season.\n\nHe’s a shot taker, shot maker and seen every situation imaginable. Those attributes would greatly serve a playoff team.\n\nBleacher Report named the Milwaukee Bucks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Lakers as five ideal teams for Crawford to join this season.\n\nAll five should make the playoffs with the Bucks, 76ers and Lakers all being legitimate championship contenders.\n\nPhoenix just can’t provide Crawford that special opportunity.\n\nThe Suns are still in rebuilding mode and have young guards like Elie Okobo and rookies Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque who need time to develop.\n\nCrawford is better, but Phoenix needs to see what it has with those youngsters.\n\nPhoenix has 15 players of its roster, the max for a regular season, on guaranteed contracts, two on non-guaranteed and a two-way player in rookie Jared Harper.\n\nNBA teams can carry 20 players in the offseason. Crawford missed training camp and preseason last year before signing with Phoenix right before the opener against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nHe probably doesn’t need a camp, but it would benefit him and the team.\n\nCrawford, who seems destined for the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, is 586 points away from reaching 20,000 for his career. Hitting that milestone would put him in Springfield for sure.\n\nHe’d have to average 7.14 points per game in 82 games to reach 20,000, but that would require him to stay healthy and play more than spot duty.\n\nHe had nagging aches and pains last season, but also played for a first-year NBA coach in Igor Kokoskov.\n\nThere was mutual respect was there, but Kokoskov didn’t handle the situation well and found himself in a dilemma of finding playing time for the young players and giving Crawford, a true rhythm player, consistent minutes.\n\nPhoenix’s new coach, Monty Williams, is expected to handle this better, by the way.\n\nLast season turned out to be Crawford’s most challenging. He averaged just 7.9 points per game, his lowest output since his rookie year, but he impacted the Suns on many levels.\n\nCrawford bonded with Booker — and everyone else on the team. He was a voice of reason in the locker room filled with young talent and had his share of standout games\n\nHe hit the game winner in Phoenix’s biggest victory of the season at Milwaukee, a team which finished with the NBA’s best record.\n\nCrawford had seven double figure games in December, scored 22 in a two-point loss at San Antonio and closed out the season with an epic 51-point performance at Dallas.\n\nIt was Dirk Nowitzki’s swan song, but Crawford, even in defeat, stole the show.\n\nCrawford wants to keep playing. Someone is going to sign him. The question is who.\n\nPhoenix would be a nice landing spot for Crawford for several reasons, but somewhere else where he could play for championship might be nicer.\n\nHave an opinion about current state of the Suns?
