        "text": "Shortly after being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer of 2021, Russell Westbrook quickly became the recipient of criticism from fans.\n\nHe had trouble fitting in, and he was clearly not close to the player he had been a couple of years prior. Even though he temporarily started playing well earlier this season after being moved to the bench, it was only a matter of time before he regressed to something akin to the disappointing level of play he was at last season.\n\nAfter Westbrook was traded to the Utah Jazz last Wednesday, a report in The Athletic detailed the tension that had built up between him and the rest of the team in his final days with the Lakers. In fact, a source close to the team compared his departure to removing “a vampire from the locker room.”\n\nFormer NBA player Jamal Crawford, a three-time Sixth Man of the Year, made it clear on social media that he had Westbrook’s back.\n\nWestbrook may have been uncoachable at times, but in other ways, he is a good human being. One only needs to look at some of the work he has done off the court, especially for children and the Black community, to see how wholesome he is as a man.\n\nNone of that excuses him for his flaws as a basketball player or for being difficult to deal with at times for his teammates and coaches. But Westbrook is not the ogre some have made him out to be."
