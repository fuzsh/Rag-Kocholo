        "text": "After signing with the Los Angeles Clippers on July 11, 2012, Jamal Crawford continued to showcase his scoring prowess and playmaking abilities. In the 2012–13 season, he averaged 16.5 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game, earning him a second-place finish in the voting for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. However, the Clippers were defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nCrawford's impact grew in the 2013–14 season, where he led all reserve players in scoring with 18.6 points per game. He also contributed 3.2 assists and 2.3 rebounds per contest, helping the Clippers achieve their best regular-season record in franchise history at 57–25. On May 8, 2014, Crawford won his second NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, solidifying his reputation as one of the league's top bench players.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Clippers, Crawford continued to make significant contributions on the court. He reached milestones such as surpassing 16,000 career points and becoming the sixth NBA player to make 2,000 career three-pointers. Additionally, he set a record as the oldest player to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award when he earned the honor for the third time at the age of 36.\n\nHowever, Crawford's time with the Clippers came to an end on July 6, 2017, when he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks along with a 2018 first-round pick as part of a salary-clearing move. The Hawks waived Crawford the following day, signaling the conclusion of his stint with the Clippers.\n\nAfter signing with the Minnesota Timberwolves on July 19, 2017, Jamal Crawford made an immediate impact for his new team. In his debut for the Timberwolves on October 18, 2017, Crawford scored 10 points in a loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Just two days later, he showcased his scoring prowess by pouring in all 17 of his points in the fourth quarter, including a clutch 3-pointer, to secure a 100–97 victory over the Utah Jazz in the Timberwolves' home opener.\n\nThroughout the season, Crawford continued to provide valuable scoring off the bench for the Timberwolves. He displayed his ability to come alive in crucial moments, such as his season-high 23-point performance in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 18, 2017, with 16 points coming in the fourth quarter. Crawford's contributions extended beyond scoring, as he also showcased his leadership and camaraderie, earning him the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award in June 2018.\n\nOne of Crawford's standout performances during his time with the Timberwolves came on March 30, 2018, when he scored 24 points in a narrow 93–92 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. His scoring prowess and veteran presence proved invaluable to the Timberwolves during the 2017–2018 season.\n\nJamal Crawford's tenure with the Phoenix Suns showcased his continued scoring prowess and ability to make history in the NBA. On December 17, 2018, during a 128–110 victory over the New York Knicks, Crawford displayed his playmaking skills by dishing out a career-high 14 assists.\n\nA significant milestone came for Crawford on January 6, 2019, when he scored 16 points in a game against the Charlotte Hornets, joining Dell Curry as the only NBA players to record 11,000+ career points as a reserve. This achievement highlighted Crawford's remarkable scoring contributions off the bench throughout his career.\n\nDuring the 2018–19 season, Crawford's per-36-minute averages demonstrated his continued impact on the court, as he averaged 15.1 points and a career-high 6.8 assists. His ability to distribute the ball effectively showcased his versatility as a scorer and facilitator.\n\nHowever, Crawford's most memorable moment of the season came on April 9, 2019, in a season finale loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Crawford made NBA history by recording 51 points, marking his fourth 50-point game. At 39 years old and 20 days, Crawford broke two NBA records: he became the oldest player to tally 50+ points, surpassing Michael Jordan, and the player with the most points scored in a game coming off the bench, surpassing Nick Anderson. Crawford's remarkable performance included efficient shooting from the field, three-point range, and the free-throw line, along with contributions in rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.\n\nFurthermore, Crawford's scoring outburst in the game against the Mavericks capped off a stretch of three consecutive 25+ point games, joining Kobe Bryant as the only players in NBA history to achieve this feat in their 19th season or later. Additionally, Crawford's achievement of scoring 50 points with four different teams solidified his place in NBA history as a prolific scorer and a versatile contributor to multiple franchises.\n\nReferences"
