        "text": "This season is about the process.\n\nFrom general manager Dennis Lindsey, to coach Quin Snyder, Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors, the Jazz have embraced what it means to be young and callow in the NBA. They understand that consistency has to come first. Then — hopefully — come the wins.\n\nThis is why the franchise is upbeat through the first month, despite riding a six-game losing streak.\n\nThere have been some rousing victories: Hayward's jumper to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers to name one. And there have been some heartbreaking defeats: look no further than Monday night's 103-101 loss to the Denver Nuggets. But through it all, the Jazz believe that there has been been improvement one month into the season — even if their 5-13 start might indicate otherwise.\n\n\"I know our record doesn't reflect it, but I think we're ahead of where a lot of people thought we'd be by this time,\" Hayward said. \"I thought we've had our moments, but we have to find some consistency. It's been a couple of steps forward, and a couple of steps back. We haven't played our best basketball recently, but this doesn't feel the same as it did last year. We're learning a lot more.\"\n\nTo underscore that notion, 5-13 is right about where most NBA observers thought the Jazz would be.\n\nGoing into Wednesday's meeting with the Toronto Raptors at EnergySolutions Arena, the Jazz are finding out just how difficult it is to win in the Western Conference. That pesky consistency Snyder craves has been fleeting at best. And so has the defense.\n\nUtah is 24th overall defensively, allowing 101.5 points per game, Conversely, the Jazz are scoring just 95.6 points per game, 23rd in the league. Under Snyder, Utah is playing its core five together exclusively in the starting lineup, but the Jazz are struggling to put the right combinations on the floor defensively.\n\nThis has been a factor in multiple losses. Utah's pick and roll defense continues to be among the worst in the league, and defensive rebounding has been an issue at times.\n\nThe Jazz have been frustrated by their early lack of success, but have claimed incremental victories. Snyder continues to stress that this season is about growth and development of key players going forward. Winning is important, he says, but improving as the year goes on is a must.\n\n\"I don't think I'll ever be happy with where we are,\" Snyder said. \"I'll always want more. That being said, you have to recognize the progress being made. We're better than we were a month ago. We have gone through adversity and played great competition. Playing against people like Blake Griffin makes you realize where you need to get better.\"\n\nIn their one-month sample, Jazz fans surely have things they can be happy about. Hayward, simply put, is rapidly developing into one of the best small forwards in the NBA. He's averaging 19.2 points per game overall, 20.2 in his last 10 games and is emerging as a legitimate No. 1 scoring option.\n\nMore importantly, Hayward also is clearly relishing the role as Utah's go-to player in fourth quarters. After a summer-long debate over whether the Jazz should have given him a maximum contract, Lindsey's gamble seems to be paying off handsomely.\n\nFavors has also made significant improvements. He's averaging a career-high 15.9 points per contest, rebounding the ball well and anchoring the middle defensively. His absence in Monday night's loss to Denver was quite noticeable on both ends. He has been a vocal leader, and he along with Hayward, appear to be cornerstones going forward.\n\nThat pleases Snyder, who has been effusive in his praise of both players this season. There are plenty of other things to work out, but the Jazz are confident that the wins will eventually come — especially when the schedule starts easing up in about a month.\n\n\"We've come a long way, and we're further along than we expected,\" Utah point guard Trey Burke said. \"It obviously may not look like that because of our record, but we're doing some good things. I think we'll snap out of it soon.\"\n\ntjones@sltrib.com\n\ntwitter: @tjonessltrib\n\n—\n\nRaptors at Jazz\n\nWhen • Wednesday, 7 p.m. MDT\n\nWhere • EnergySolutions Arena, Salt Lake City\n\nTV • ROOT Sports\n\nRadio • 1280 AM\n\nAbout the Raptors • Leading scorer DeMar DeRozan is out indefinitely with a torn groin muscle … Toronto is currently the team with the top record in the Eastern Conference. … The Raptors average 108.5 points per game, second in the NBA\n\nAbout the Jazz • Utah is mired in a six game losing streak. … The Jazz were without center Derrick Favors in Monday's loss to Denver.
