        "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers became just the third NBA team in history to record a perfect record in a calendar month, taking their 17th straight win by defeating the Utah Jazz 107-96 on Sunday. The Clippers went 16-0 in December to join the 1995-96 San Antonio Spurs and 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers as the only teams to go undefeated in a month. Their franchise-record winning streak is the longest in the NBA since Boston won 19 in a row four years ago.\n\nLos Angeles' Jamal Crawford scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter to guide the Clippers home while Caron Butler led the team with 29 points, making all six of his 3-pointers. Al Jefferson scored 30 points one off his season high to lead Utah, which lost for the third time during the Clippers' streak.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs led from start to finish against the Dallas Mavericks, with Tony Parker having 21 points and nine assists and Manu Ginobili making several key baskets among his 20 points. Darren Collison scored 18 points for the Mavericks, whose six-game skid is their longest since January of their championship season, 2010-11. Dirk Nowitzki had just eight points as he works back to fitness after knee surgery.\n\nTayshaun Prince made two free throws with 10.9 seconds left to give the Detroit Pistons a 96-94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, escaping with victory despite having blown a 14-point lead. Prince scored 20 points, and Greg Monroe added 14 points and 10 rebounds for Detroit, which had five players in double figures. Monta Ellis had 30 points and nine assists for Milwaukee.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings had a 118-96 win over the struggling Boston Celtics. Isaiah Thomas scored 27 points and made one of Sacramento's two four-point plays in the second half andc John Salmons added 23 points off the bench for the Kings, who ended the calendar year by winning their sixth home game out of the last seven.\n\nThe Celtics' trip to California to face the Clippers, Golden State and Sacramento saw them get outscored by an aggregate of 69 points in losing all three. Paul Pierce and Jason Terry both scored 20 points for Boston."
