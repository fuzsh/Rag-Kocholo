* After a blowout loss Tuesday in Cleveland, the Pistons return home to play their first of five remaining back-to-backs on the season. Detroit is 3-9 this season on the second night, most recently pulling off a win Thursday over the Cavaliers.

* The Jazz - 114-108 winners over the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday - had Tuesday off to prepare for a four-game road trip. Utah has played two of its last three games away from Salt Lake City.

* Entering Wednesday, Detroit sits with a 1/2-game lead over the Milwaukee Bucks for seventh place in the NBA's Eastern Conference. The Bucks play at the Clippers tonight, a game televised nationally.

* There were no known injuries to the Pistons, so expect their starting five to stay the same: Reggie Jackson (PG), Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (SG), Marcus Morris (SF), Tobias Harris (PF) and Andre Drummond (C).

* Utah boasts the third-best defense in the NBA, holding opponents to a league-best 96.6 points per game on 44.2 percent shooting.

* Probable starters for the Jazz: George Hill, Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward, Joe Johnson and Rudy Gobert. Derrick Favors (left knee) has missed the last three games, while Shelvin Mack (ankle sprain) has missed the last five.

* This is the second and final regular-season meeting between the two teams. Utah beat the Pistons, 110-77, Jan. 13 in Salt Lake City and has won four of its last five at the Palace.
