        "text": "The ongoing stay-at-home orders present a good opportunity for Christians to focus on strengthening their relationships with Christ, wrestling star Hulk Hogan said.\n\n“God has taken away everything we worship,” he wrote on his Instagram page. “God said, ‘you want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You want to worship musicians, I will shut down civic centers. You want to worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don’t want to go to church and worship , I will make it where you can’t go to church.’”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B-djnBnjAjl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nHogan’s post included a photo of him praying against a wall. “Maybe we don’t need a vaccine,” he said. “Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters. Jesus.”\n\nHogan also included 2 Chronicles 7:14 in his post, which says, “If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Hogan posted another photo of 2 Chronicles 7:13-14 to his Instagram page, calling it “one of the most powerful gifts to our human race.”\n\nHogan is one of many celebrities who have also said on their social media sites that the pandemic is a way to come closer to God. Christians, and even non-Christians, have been sharing his Bible verses on social media. Something Hogan says is a God thing.\n\n“I think God’s in this, I really do,” singer Dolly Parton said. “I think he’s trying to hold us up to the light so we can see ourselves and see each other through the eyes of love. And I hope we learn that lesson.”\n\n–Dwight Widaman | Metro Voice"
