        "text": "Indian Rocks, FL, - Hulk Hogan, the iconic wrestler whose yellow bandana and handlebar mustache have graced arenas for decades, has taken a new stage: the baptismal font. The 70-year-old WWE legend, recently married to Sky Daily Hogan, underwent a public baptism ceremony at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida, calling it the \"greatest day of my life.\"\n\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, has long spoken openly about his Christian faith. In a recent social media post, he reflected on accepting Christ at 14, stating that \"training, prayers, and vitamins\" kept him in the game. However, this baptism marks a deeper commitment, publicly declaring his faith and \"total surrender and dedication to Jesus.\"\n\nPhotos and videos of the ceremony show Hogan and Sky, dressed in white, being gently submerged in the baptismal pool by a pastor. Hogan's signature bandana, this time in white, remains firmly in place, a testament to his enduring persona even in this sacred moment. His wife, Sky, also expressed her joy, sharing on social media that she was \"so proud\" of her husband and \"blessed\" to be baptized alongside him.\n\nThe news has resonated with fans and the broader community. Indian Rocks Baptist Church, where the ceremony took place, celebrated the occasion, sharing Hogan's post on their Instagram story with the caption, \"God is doing amazing things at Indian Rocks.\" Fans, too, have taken to social media, congratulating Hogan on his newfound faith and sharing their own experiences with baptism.\n\nHogan's decision to publicly undergo baptism comes at a time of personal transformation. In recent years, he has faced controversies and legal challenges, but his faith has remained a constant source of strength. This public declaration of his commitment to Christianity suggests a renewed focus on faith and family in the next chapter of his life."
