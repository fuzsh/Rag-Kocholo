        "text": "Hulk Hogan speaks highly of Roman Reigns.\n\nUndisputed WWE Universal Roman Reigns is having a remarkable run with the gold, as he has reigned supreme for over 1,240 days. WWE fans have not seen such a long reign in years. Reigns has a chance to make more history by surpassing Hulk Hogan's longest reign (1,474 days).\n\nSpeaking with Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated, Hulk Hogan praised Roman Reigns.\n\n“It takes a really long time to be able to transition and pivot on a dime the way he does. That’s how he paints masterpieces you’ve never seen before. He’s working on a whole different level,\" Hogan said.\n\nHogan also noted that Reigns' dad, Sikia Anoa'i, taught him the business and highlighted the way Reigns creates emotion in the ring. He stated that Reigns has adapted old-school lessons into the new era. Hogan also shared his belief that Reigns would fit into any area.\n\n“Roman’s dad, Sika, he explained the ABCs of it all to him. Watch his matches and you can tell. You can see it in the way Roman creates emotion, understands how to make the crowd mad, and how he puts people on the edge of their seat calling for that comeback. Roman Reigns learned this all old-school from his dad, but he adapted to the newer era, too. He can do it all. Roman is adaptable to whoever he is wrestling. That’s important. At any moment in time, he can switch gears on you. He’s amazing, and he’d fit in any era,\" Hogan said.\n\nCheck out Hulk Hogan's comments about Dusty Rhodes here.\n\nCody Rhodes recently stated that he wants to face Roman Reigns again.
