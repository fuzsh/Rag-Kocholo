        "text": "Hulk Hogan is considered to be one of the most popular and charismatic wrestlers of any era, having personally contributed to WWE's fame around the world. However, there was no lack of episodes that have ruined - at least in part - the image of him, so much so that several colleagues and insiders have harshly attacked him over the years.\n\nAlthough Jim Ross has never had a close relationship with Hogan, he has always shown his enormous respect for the WWE legend. 'JR' joined the Stamford federation as a commentator way back in 1993, shortly before Hogan left the company.\n\nHulk played in New Japan Pro Wrestling and WCW, only to make his return to WWE in 2002. Between ups and downs, his career went on for another four years (his last match dates back to 2006). As part of his 'Grilling JR' podcast, Ross confided that he never interfaced with Hogan on financial matters.\n\nJim Ross talks about Hulk Hogan\n\n“Vince McMahon has always had a habit of taking some talent under his wing. He took possession of it, I don't know if I give the idea. By the time he returned to WWE, I had no relationship with Hulk Hogan.\n\nWe are not friends, but I respect him and have no resentment towards him. I never got close to him” - said Jim Ross. On the other hand, the affectionate relationship between 'JR' and Stone Cold Steve Austin is well known.\n\nIn 2007, the former WWE commentator was even inducted into the Hall of Fame by his longtime friend. “In addition to the aforementioned Hulk Hogan, Vince has taken care of other superstars like Warrior and Bret Hart. Stone Cold Steve Austin quickly became my man, in fact, we have built a beautiful relationship over the years.\n\nI did everything possible to make Stone Cold successful for himself and for the company. I have personally dealt with his contract and his happiness within the company.\" While many believed that Hulk Hogan had reached his career's peak, the two-time Hall of Famer proved all critics wrong by joining WWE's arch-rival WCW and forming the legendary New World Order faction.\n\nThis complete change in gimmick led to Hollywood Hulk Hogan becoming a six-time WCW World Heavyweight champion. He also holds the record for the longest reign with the title. Hulk Hogan shifted to 1040 Eldorado Ave. in Clearwater, Florida in 2012 and has been residing there ever since.\n\nPurchased for a whopping $3.3 Million, Hulk Hogan's current residence is only 22 miles away from Tampa Bay, the location for WrestleMania 37."
