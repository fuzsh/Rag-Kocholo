Early '98 was one of WCW's most successful times.\n\nExactly. Hogans contract was up and WCW was booming. He knew that he could bait them to give him more money by playing WWF and WCW off each other. He tried to say he was the reason WCW was doing so well and if he left and went back to WWF the business could turn just as easily and it would be the WWF doing such great business.\n\nThat's the easiest way to get a lot of money from somebody....publically negotiate with their biggest competition. It scares them into giving you exactly what you want.\n\nPost by Patrick Bateman on\n\nwell obviously hogan seen hbk screw bret at wm 17 so its likely\n\nTrue, Hogan thinks the Montreal Screw job was Shawn Michaels holding Bret down and pinning him at Wrestlemania 17.\n\nThe hell would Hogan care about either of them? He's the wrestling political machine, a one man army. He made sure Yokozuna beat Bret so he could win the title at WrestleMania 9. Hell, he walked into Clique territory years later and won the title off of Triple H and beat Michaels.\n\nHogan could do anything in either company. I'll always respect Hogan more than Bret especially because Hogan's not a mark for himself like Bret is. Hogan did business properly, and made himself a ton of money.\n\nPost by ihavethepower on\n\nWrestling is a business and Hulk Hogan is a brand. Hogan protected himself and always made sure that his brand name was never killed off by a promoter. Compare how Hogan protected his career to how Flair let every promoter rape him. Flair bitched and moaned about it all through his book.\n\nGetting the top two companies into a bidding war during the height of wrestling's popularity in the 90's, cannot be seen as anything other than GREAT BUSINESS SENSE!\n\nAs far as being a businessman in pro wrestling, Hogan should ALWAYS be seen as the role model that people strive to be.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@bane said:\n\nIm sorry but TWO people AGREE that HBK vs. Hart was WM 17?¡?¡?¡?¡\n\nKids...PLEASE watch the legacy sets of Wrestlemania. IT is only around $200. Please get it.\n\n. The are saying that Hogan once said that. Not saying they believe it\n\nPost by Dwight on\n\nI remember him saying something about it in his book. I believe he had recently just started communicating with Vince again and Vince expressed interest in him returning to the WWF with his contract to WCW expiring.\n\nThat would have been weird as hell.\n\nPost by carly1988 on\n\n@bane said:\n\nIm sorry but TWO people AGREE that HBK vs. Hart was WM 17?¡?¡?¡?¡\n\nKids...PLEASE watch the legacy sets of Wrestlemania.

Hogan was on a radio show and said that HBK screwed Hart at Wrestlemania.\n\nPost by skribbel24 on\n\nHogan as part of the attitude era would have been weird. Well I guess he was (early 2002).\n\nIMO, Hogan's heel turn and the birth of the NWO was the one that started the new era of wrestling, which was in the WWF the Attitude era.\n\nPost by ztj_wwf on\n\nwell obviously hogan seen hbk screw bret at wm 17 so its likely\n\nTrue, Hogan thinks the Montreal Screw job was Shawn Michaels holding Bret down and pinning him at Wrestlemania 17.\n\nDidn't he say WM 16?\n\nPost by hulkhogancollector on\n\n@ihavethepower said:\n\nWrestling is a business and Hulk Hogan is a brand.
