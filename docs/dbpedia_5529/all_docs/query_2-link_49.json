        "text": "Post by CMWaters on\n\nI think it was more to give a Hogan that felt evolved slightly from the 80s/90s version. Still has some of the Hollywood Hogan styling post WWE's nWo (feathered boas, sunglasses, at the time still had the beard with the blonde mustache), but eventually changed to the red and yellow gear, making a composite of the two versions rather than a straight reverting like what WCW did in 1999. That and \"Real American\" to some might have been seen as \"dated\" as a theme.\n\nThe choice was made pretty clear when WWE got the bills for the rights to use \"Voodoo Child\" though, hence why it was dubbed over in DVDs/WWE Network and the return to \"Real American\".\n\nPost by DichEvans on\n\nI may have asked this before, but why didnt Hogan use Real American for his 2002-03 face run? Aside from the time he and Edge won the tag titles and the Mr. America stuff, he just used Voodoo Child, which, while a very good song, I associate with heel Hogan more. Was there some dispute with Rick Derringer (I know they couldnt use Demolition for a while on DVDs or WWE 24/7)?\n\nHave to contextualize this to the era a bit. The late 80's and early 90's was REALLY built around the \"nuclear/traditional family\" concept. Everything had to be safe and Hogan was a pop culture centre-piece of that.\n\nThe late 90's/early 2000's culture was the antithesis of that, often being offensive just for the sake of being offensive. Fans turned on Hogan in WCW because young people were growing up in the grudge scene and thought Hogan's act was stale and not meant for them and \"passe\". VKM's attitude era promo even took a shot at that\n\nThe beginning of Hogan's WWE run happened just as the Attitude Era was ending and that entire era centred around moving away from the cheesy early 90's and late 80's culture. I am guessing the WWE felt that theme was too cheesy, but finally gave into nostalgia by 2004"
