        "text": "The spirit of Hulkamania is set to be celebrated by WWE, but it’s uncertain whether Hulk Hogan will be making a televised appearance.\n\nHogan captured the WWF Championship for the first time on January 23, 1984, which is widely recognized as the day that ‘Hulkamania’ was born. Hogan would capture the title from The Iron Sheik, who proved to be a transitional champion after dethroning seven-year champion Bob Backlund. The Iron Sheik won the title due to Vince McMahon wanting the gold on Hogan but didn’t want the Hulkster to dethrone his fellow babyface.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Celebration of Hulkamania\n\nWrestle Votes reports that WWE is planning quite the celebration to mark 40 years of Hulkamania’s birth. New pieces of merchandise and collectibles about Hogan’s win are in store. The report adds that an appearance by Hogan isn’t out of the question, but is not being planned as of right now. Hogan’s most recent appearance for WWE came as part of the Raw is XXX episode in January 2023.\n\nHulk Hogan: Superhero and Sinner\n\nHogan is considered by many to be one of, if not the single most influential professional wrestler the industry has ever seen. Hogan’s clean-cut babyface would enamor fans for years during the appropriately named Hulkamania Era, while his transformation into Hollywood Hogan and formation of the NWO would usher in the era of ‘cool heels.’\n\nThe Hulkster is also considered one of wrestling’s most controversial names. In 2015, Hogan was fired from WWE after racist comments he’d made years earlier came to light. Hogan was also removed from WWE’s Hall of Fame but was reappointed and welcomed back into the company in 2018. While WWE has forgiven Hogan (and given him a second HOF induction) fans have been less accepting of the Hulkster, who has often faced claims of politicking at the expense of other wrestlers. Hogan’s controversies are set to be covered in a new series coming to VICE TV.\n\n- Advertisement -"
