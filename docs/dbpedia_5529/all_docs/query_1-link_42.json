        "text": "Wrestling star Hulk Hogan believes God is using the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to strip people of the idols they have in their lives.\n\nWith 95% of Americans under stay-at-home orders, the celebrity — whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea — urged people to use their newfound free time to reflect on God and the Bible.\n\n“God has taken away everything we worship,” the 66-year-old Hogan wrote in the now-viral Instagram post with a photo of the wrestler praying against a wall.\n\nGod said, “You want to worship athletes, I will shut down the stadiums. You want to worship musicians, I will shut down civic centers. You want to worship actors, I will shut down theaters. You want to worship money, I will shut down the economy and collapse the stock market. You don’t want to go to church and worship me, I will make it where you can’t go to a church.”\n\nHe went on to reference 2 Chronicles 7:14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. OPEN VERSE IN BIBLE (nlt) , which reads, “If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.”\n\nFaithwire: The Coronavirus Is Revealing One of America’s Biggest Idols\n\nHogan concluded the post by arguing maybe people “don’t need a vaccine.” Instead, he wrote, “Maybe we need to take this time of isolation from the distractions of the world and have a personal revival where we focus on the ONLY thing in the world that really matters. Jesus.”\n\nJust a few days earlier, Hogan posted a highlighted portion from the Bible, pointing his followers again to 2 Chronicles 7:14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. OPEN VERSE IN BIBLE (nlt) . He described the passage as “one of the most powerful gifts to our human race.”\n\nHogan is not the only celebrity to believe God is using this health crisis to teach people a lesson.\n\nIn late March, country music legend Dolly Parton said she thinks “we’re gonna all be better people” when the pandemic ends.\n\n“I think God’s in this, I really do,” she explained. “I think he’s trying to hold us up to the light so we can see ourselves and see each other through the eyes of love. And I hope we learn that lesson.”"
