        "text": "Brian Damage\n\nThe ‘If Factor’ are a series of articles that takes a look at real scenarios in pro wrestling that at one point or another were suggested, planned, considered…but did not get the green light to continue. What would the landscape of professional wrestling look like if these ideas came to fruition?\n\nThe If: Hulk Hogan Returns to the WWF in 1997\n\nWith the Monday Night Wars heating up between the WWF and WCW, it wasn’t uncommon to see wrestlers jump back and forth to the rival promotion. In 1997, the WWF was ushering in the more adult themed ‘attitude era.’ Vince McMahon wanted to make a big splash and according to one of his top executives Bruce Prichard….there was talk in bringing back one of his top stars from the 1980’s in Hulk Hogan.\n\nBy this time, Hogan was with WCW and helped that company leap over the WWF by turning heel and forming the New World Order. Hogan made it known that his WCW contract was expiring and would certainly entertain a return to the WWF. Talks began between McMahon and Hogan, but Prichard insisted that the discussions weren’t very extensive. It appeared that Hogan was just using the WWF as leverage to get more money out of WCW…which happened when word got back to WCW exec Eric Bischoff. What if Bischoff didn’t bite and allowed Hogan to return to the WWF? How would Hulk Hogan fit in during the Attitude Era?"
