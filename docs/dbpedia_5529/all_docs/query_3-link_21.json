        "text": "Instructor: Paul Yoon\n\nTBD | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nAdvanced fiction workshop for students who have already taken a workshop at Harvard or elsewhere. The goal of the class is to continue your journey as a writer. You will be responsible for participating in discussions on the assigned texts, the workshop, engaging with the work of your colleagues, and revising your work.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: *Please note: previous creative writing workshop experience required.* Please submit ONLY a cover letter telling me your previous creative writing workshop experience, either at Harvard or elsewhere; then tell me something you are passionate about and something you want to be better at; and, lastly, tell me why of all classes you want to take this one this semester. Again, please no writing samples.\n\nInstructor: Laura van den Berg\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nTuesday, 12:00-2:45 pm | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nJulio Cortázar: “The fantastic breaks the crust of appearance … something grabs us by the shoulders to throw us outside ourselves.” This workshop will explore the art of writing literature that unsettles our understanding of reality, that splits open the world as we know it, allowing us to encounter new possibilities. The initial weeks will focus on exploratory exercises and the study of published short stories and craft essays. Later, student work will become the primary text as the focus shifts to workshop discussion. Authors on the syllabus will likely include Julio Cortázar, Mariana Enríquez, Sofia Samatar, Yoko Ogawa, and Jorge Luis Borges. This workshop welcomes writers of all levels of experience.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a letter of introduction. I’d like to know a little about why you are drawn to studying fiction and to “world-bending” in particular; what you hope to get out of the workshop and what you hope to contribute; and one thing you are passionate about outside writing / school. A writing sample is not required; you will be writing entirely new work for this course.\n\nInstructor: Teju Cole\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nTuesday, 6:00-8:45pm | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nThis reading and writing intensive workshop is for students who want to learn to write literary fiction. The goal of the course would be for each student to produce two polished short stories. Authors on the syllabus will probably include James Joyce, Eudora Welty, Toni Morrison, Alice Munro, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Diane Williams.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a cover letter saying what you hope to get out of the workshop. In the cover letter, mention three works of fiction that matter to you and why. In addition, submit a 400–500 word sample of your fiction; the sample can be self-contained or a section of a longer work.\n\nInstructor: Laura van den Berg\n\nTBD | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nA promising draft is of little use to us as writers if we have no idea what to do next, of how to begin again. This course aims to illuminate how revision can be every bit as creative and exhilarating as getting the first draft down—and how time spent re-imagining our early drafts is the ultimate show of faith in our work. We will explore the art of revision—of realizing the promise of that first draft—through reading, craft discussion, exercises, and workshop. Students can expect to leave the semester with two polished short stories (or 40-50 polished novel pages), a keener understanding of their own writing process, and a plan for where to take their work next. Texts will include How to Write an Autobiographical Novel by Alexander Chee, Refuse to by Done by Matt Bell, and Craft in the Real World by Matthew Salesses. It will be helpful to enter into the semester with some pre-existing material that you wish to revise (a short story, several chapters of a novel). Previous experience with workshopping writing is encouraged but not required.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a brief letter—1-2 pages—that discusses your interest in the course and in writing more broadly. What are you interested in working on and learning more about, at this point in your practice? Please also submit a short—2-3 page—writing sample (the first 2 pages of a short story or novel, for example).\n\nInstructor: Paul Yoon\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nMonday, 12:00-2:45 pm | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students.\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nAn introductory workshop where we will learn to read as writers and study all aspects of the craft of fiction writing, including such topics as character, point of view, structure, time, and plot. The first weeks will focus heavily on writing exercises and reading contemporary short fiction. Writers we will study will include: Daniyal Mueenuddin, Haruki Murakami, Jenny Erpenbeck, and Tom Drury. As the semester progresses, the focus of the workshop will shift to creating and discussing your own work at the table, along with submitting a final revision project.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit ONLY a letter to me. I want to know what your favorite work of fiction is and why; and then tell me something you are passionate about and something you want to be better at; and, lastly, tell me why of all classes you want to take this one this semester. Please no writing samples.\n\nInstructor: Louisa Thomas\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nTuesday, 9:00-11:45am | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nIn newsrooms, the sports section is sometimes referred to as the “toy department” -- frivolous and unserious, unlike the stuff of politics, business, and war. In this course, we will take the toys seriously. After all, for millions of people, sports and other so-called trivial pursuits (video games, chess, children’s games, and so on) are a source of endless fascination. For us, they will be a source of stories about human achievements and frustrations. These stories can involve economic, social, and political issues. They can draw upon history, statistics, psychology, and philosophy. They can be reported or ruminative, formally experimental or straightforward, richly descriptive or tense and spare. They can be fun. Over the course of the semester, students will read and discuss exemplary profiles, essays, articles, and blog posts, while also writing and discussing their own. While much (but not all) of the reading will come from the world of sports, no interest in or knowledge about sports is required; our focus will be on writing for a broad audience.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: To apply, please write a letter describing why you want to take the course and what you hope to get out of it. Include a few examples of websites or magazines you like to read, and tell me briefly about one pursuit -- football, chess, basketball, ballet, Othello, crosswords, soccer, whatever -- that interests you and why.\n\nInstructor: Melissa Cundieff\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nPlease login to the course catalog at my.harvard.edu for meetings times & location\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nAs memoirist and author Melissa Febos puts it: “The narrator is never you, and the sooner we can start thinking of ourselves on the page that way, the better for our work. That character on the page is just this shaving off of the person that was within a very particular context, intermingled with bits of perspective from all the time since — it’s a very specific little cocktail of pieces of the self and memory and art … it’s a very weird thing. And then it’s frozen in the pages.” With each essay and work of nonfiction we produce in this workshop-based class, the character we portray, the narrator we locate, is never stagnant, instead we are developing a persona, wrought from the experience of our vast selves and our vast experiences. To that end, in this course, you will use the tools and stylistic elements of creative nonfiction, namely fragmentation, narrative, scene, point of view, speculation, and research to remix and retell all aspects of your experience and selfhood in a multiplicity of ways. I will ask that you focus on a particular time period or connected events, and through the course of the semester, you will reimagine and reify these events using different modes and techniques as modeled in the published and various works we read. We will also read, in their entireties, Melissa Febos's Body Work: The Radical Work of Personal Narrative, as well as Hanif Abdurraqib’s They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us, which will aid our discussions and help us to better understand the difference between persona(s) and the many versions of self that inhabit us.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Applications for this class should include a 2-3 page (double-spaced if prose, single-spaced if poetry) creating writing sample of any genre (nonfiction, fiction, poetry), or combination of genres. Additionally, I ask that students submit a 250-word reflection on their particular relationship with creative writing and why this course appeals to them. This class is open to students of all writing levels and experience.\n\nInstructor: Darcy Frey\n\nFall 2024:\n\nThursday, 3:00-5:45 pm | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students.\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nIn this hands-on writing workshop, we will study the art of narrative journalism in many different forms: Profile writing, investigative reportage, magazine features. How can a work of journalism be fashioned to tell a captivating story? How can the writer of nonfiction narratives employ the scene-by-scene construction usually found in fiction? How can facts become the building blocks of literature? Students will work on several short assignments to practice the nuts-and-bolts of reporting, then write a longer magazine feature to be workshopped in class and revised at the end of the term. We will take instruction and inspiration from the published work of literary journalists such as Joan Didion, John McPhee, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, and John Jeremiah Sullivan. This is a workshop-style class intended for undergraduate and graduate students at all levels of experience. No previous experience in English Department courses is required.\n\nApply via Submittable (deadline: 11:59pm ET on Thursday, August 22)\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please write a substantive letter of introduction describing who you are as writer at the moment and where you hope to take your writing; what experience you may have had with journalism or narrative nonfiction; what excites you about narrative journalism in particular; and what you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. Additionally, please submit 3-5 pages of journalism or narrative nonfiction or, if you have not yet written much nonfiction, an equal number of pages of narrative fiction.\n\nInstructor: Darcy Frey\n\nFall 2024:\n\nWednesday, 3:00-5:45 pm | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students.\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nWhether it takes the form of literary journalism, essay, memoir, or environmental writing, creative nonfiction is a powerful genre that allows writers to break free from the constraints commonly associated with nonfiction prose and reach for the breadth of thought and feeling usually accomplished only in fiction: the narration of a vivid story, the probing of a complex character, the argument of an idea, or the evocation of a place. Students will work on several short assignments to hone their mastery of the craft, then write a longer piece that will be workshopped in class and revised at the end of the term. We will take instruction and inspiration from published authors such as Joan Didion, James Baldwin, Ariel Levy, Alexander Chee, and Virginia Woolf. This is a workshop-style class intended for undergraduate and graduate students at all levels of experience. No previous experience in English Department courses is required.\n\nApply via Submittable (deadline: 11:59pm ET on Thursday, August 22)\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please write a substantive letter of introduction describing who you are as writer at the moment and where you hope to take your writing; what experience you may have had with creative/literary nonfiction; what excites you about nonfiction in particular; and what you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. Additionally, please submit 3-5 pages of creative/literary nonfiction (essay, memoir, narrative journalism, etc, but NOT academic writing) or, if you have not yet written much nonfiction, an equal number of pages of narrative fiction.\n\nInstructor: Maggie Doherty\n\nTBD | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nThis course will focus on the genres of nonfiction writing commonly published in magazines: the feature, the profile, the personal essay, and longform arts criticism. We will read and discuss examples of such pieces from magazines large (Harper’s, The New Yorker) and small (n+1, The Drift); our examples will be drawn from the last several years. We will discuss both the process of writing such pieces—research, reporting, drafting, editing—and the techniques required to write informative, engaging, elegant nonfiction. In addition to short writing exercises performed in class and outside of class, each student will write one long piece in the genre of their choosing over the course of the semester, workshopping the piece twice, at different stages of completion. Although some attention will be paid to pitching and placing work in magazines, the focus of the course will be on the writing process itself.\n\nInstructor: Josh Bell\n\nMonday, TBD | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nInitially, students can expect to read, discuss, and imitate the strategies of a wide range of poets writing in English; to investigate and reproduce prescribed forms and poetic structures; and to engage in writing exercises meant to expand the conception of what a poem is and can be. As the course progresses, reading assignments will be tailored on an individual basis, and an increasing amount of time will be spent in discussion of student work.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a portfolio including a letter of interest, ten poems, and a list of classes (taken at Harvard or elsewhere) that seem to have bearing on your enterprise.\n\nInstructor: Reginald Dwayne Betts\n\nTDB | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nThis workshop will be an exploration into the ways that poets in the past have reckoned in print with the personal and the public, while also provided students with a fundamental understanding of what the public/private dichotomy is, as seen through the works of James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lucille Clifton, Jack Gilbert and others, with the ultimate goal being to produce a body of work of their own that is aware of both its referents and singularities. Students will be expected to produce drafts on a weekly basis.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a portfolio including a letter of interest, up to ten poems, and a list of classes (taken at Harvard or elsewhere) that seem to have bearing on your enterprise.\n\nInstructor: Musa Syeed\n\nSpring 2024:\n\nWednesday, 12:00-2:45pm | Location: TBA\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students\n\nCourse Site\n\nSpring 2025: TBD\n\nThe feature-length script is an opportunity to tell a story on a larger scale, and, therefore, requires additional preparation. In this class, we will move from writing a pitch, to a synopsis, to a treatment/outline, to the first 10 pages, to the first act of a feature screenplay. We will analyze produced scripts and discuss various elements of craft, including research, writing layered dialogue, world-building, creating an engaging cast of characters. As an advanced class, we will also look at ways both mainstream and independent films attempt to subvert genre and structure.\n\nStudents will end the semester with a first act (20-30 pages) of their feature, an outline, and strategy to complete the full script.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Please submit a 3-5 page writing sample. Screenplays are preferred, but fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry, and plays are acceptable as well. Also, please write a short note to introduce yourself. Include a couple films/filmmakers that have inspired you, your goals for the class, as well as any themes/subject matter/ideas you might be interested in exploring in your writing for film.\n\nInstructor: Sam Marks\n\nTBD | Location: TBD\n\nEnrollment: Limited to 12 students.\n\nThis workshop is a continued exploration of writing for the stage, with an eye towards presentation. The semester will culminate in a staged reading of each student's work for the Harvard Playwrights Festival. Each reading will be directed by a professional director. Students will be encouraged to excavate their own voice in playwriting and learn from the final presentation. The class will examine the design of the stage, the playworld, and the page. Students will attempt multiple narrative strategies and dialogue techniques. They will bolster their craft of playwriting through generating short scripts and a completed one act. Readings will include significant contributors to the theatrical form such as Caryl Churchill and Samuel Beckett as well as contemporary dramatists such as Annie Baker, Jackie Sibbles Drury, Branden Jacobs Jenkins, and Jeremy O. Harris.\n\nSupplemental Application Information: Prior experience in writing the dramatic form is strongly encouraged. Please submit a 5-10 page writing sample (preferably a play or screenplay, but all genres are acceptable). Also, please write a few sentences about a significant theatrical experience (a play read or seen) and how it affected you."
