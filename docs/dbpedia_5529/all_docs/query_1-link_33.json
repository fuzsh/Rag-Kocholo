        "text": "Two months after announcing his engagement at a wedding reception at the Birchwood Hotel in downtown St. Petersburg, WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan got married last weekend at Indian Rocks Baptist Church.\n\nThe Tampa native, whose real name is Terry Bollea, posted a video on Instagram set to Chris Stapleton’s “Tennessee Whiskey,” showing that he tied the knot with yoga instructor Sky Daily in a small ceremony on Friday.\n\nThe 70-year-old wore a black tuxedo with a black headband as he greeted his bride, 45, who was clad in a strapless lace gown that TMZ reported was designed by New Zealand bridal outfit Rue de Seine, adorned with 18-karat white gold earrings encrusted with four-karat diamonds with a matching bracelet and necklace. She also flashed a dazzling wedding and engagement ring set estimated to be worth $500,000.\n\nPictures show Daily’s children from a previous relationship and Hogan’s son, Nick, were in attendance as witnesses to his third marriage.\n\n“I asked Sky to marry me, and she was crazy enough to say yes, brother,” Hogan said in an Instagram video when he announced the engagement in July. And on Monday he posted a wedding video with: “My new life starts now.”\n\nHis daughter Brooke Hogan was noticeably absent from the ceremony. She said over the weekend on Instagram: “As many of you know, I value my privacy, but unfortunately, a lot of media outlets are making assumptions as to why I did not attend my father’s third wedding.”\n\nThe “Hogan Knows Best” alum revealed that given how things have progressed with her family, especially in the public eye, she found the best way to navigate the drama.\n\n“For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals, and values. I wish him well.”"
