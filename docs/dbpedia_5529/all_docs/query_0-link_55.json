        "text": "This is likely my last year handing out annual wrestling awards. A huge blow to your late January, I realize, but I can no longer catch up on the weekly shows, so I won’t feel comfortable giving out awards, especially since it’s the weekly shows rather than the PPVs that really have my heart. I had planned on giving up wrestling entirely after watching Extreme Rules (gag), but The Bloodline managed to reel me back in. Still, this is the last run for the Zack Slammys. Mourn accordingly.\n\nMoment of the Year: Cody Rhodes wrestles with a torn pectoral muscle\n\nMy heart wants to go with Liv Morgan cashing in and winning the Smackdown Women’s Championship here, but I’m getting a little tired of the WWE giving the women’s Money in the Bank contract to an undercarder, having them get the belt in “the most emotional and surprising moment we’ve seen all year,” and then burying them in a couple of months because they never planned to have them be a rotation main eventer. Although it made sense for Nikki A.S.H., Liv deserved a real shot, and instead they had her tap out in her first title defense, then talk about how she tapped out, then later lose convincingly to the same opponent. Now, predictably, she’s basically back where she was before. It cheapens the moment for me.\n\nThe most memorable moment of the year (after that) is Cody going through with his Hell in a Cell match with Seth Rollins despite a visibly hideous injury that would prevent me from even posting on Facebook for months. When he took his jacket off once he got in the ring, and the crowd gasped in horror…chills. My wife and I actually thought it was stage makeup and were annoyed at the WWE for going so over the top with it, but as it turned out, Cody is just a hardcore and slightly crazy superstar who earned the right to have this meaningless Zack award.\n\nHonorable Mention: Liv Morgan cashes in and wins the title; “Sami Uso! Sami Uso! Sami Uso!”\n\nMatch of the Year: Gunther vs. Sheamus, Clash at the Castle\n\nI can’t even describe the next-level brutality in this match. So I won’t. You have Peacock if you’re reading this. Go watch it. You won’t regret it. I mean, look at this:\n\nThe Rhodes/Rollins match gets special mention for the reasons I went into above. Although I might be the only one who picks it over Belair/Lynch at Wrestlemania, I think Flair/Rousey at Backlash was the best women’s match of the year, bolstered by Flair saying “I Quit” clean in the middle of the ring. Who saw that coming?\n\nFor the record, Lynch was just a terrible, terrible heel, and her exaggerated cartoon angry faces took every match of hers down a click for me. In that Wrestlemania match, for example, she broke out her comical heel disbelief face after a garden variety legdrop, which took away from the drama of the match. Why would I be invested in her justified disbelief at Belair’s later heroics when her character’s mind was already blown by her opponent kicking out of a move she’s literally never beaten anyone with? It really detraced from her work. I’m glad she switched back.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Seth Rollins vs. Cody Rhodes, Hell in the Cell; Charlotte Flair vs. Ronda Rousey, Wrestlemania Backlash\n\nRoman Reigns Match of the Year: Roman Reigns vs. Drew McIntyre, Clash at the Castle\n\nI can’t believe I didn’t come up with this idea two years ago. Reigns is on such a higher plane than everyone else that it doesn’t even make sense to put him in with the other contenders for Match of the Year. It would clutter up all of the slots. So, he gets his own category. I really wish I’d done this in 2021, when he submitted at least six matches worth memorializing, but I didn’t. He didn’t wrestle as much this year, and the Biggest Match in Wrestlemania History ended up as a dud because of injury, but he still operated in a different mode than everyone else. I’m disappointed that the WWE has gotten away with not having him show up for every PPV, but they have rightly concluded that there’s nothing any of us can do about it, and the rest of The Bloodline does so much good stuff on their own that it almost (but doesn’t) makes up for it.\n\nI went back and forth on the pick itself. I like his match with Rollins the most, but the cheap ending means I can’t in good conscience give it any awards. Other people seem higher on the Summerslam match with Lesnar than me, but I still liked it. The McIntyre match was pretty much just regular stuff for the first ten minutes, reminiscent of (and possibly even exactly the same as) their match at Survivor Series the year before, but the ending had SO many fireworks that it ended up being Reigns’ best match overall this year. What it really comes down to is that, since the Lesnar match at Wrestlemania wrapped up so suddenly and the rematch at Summerslam was a last man standing match, there was really only one moment in this ENTIRE calendar year where I thought there MIGHT be a LITTLE TINY CHANCE that Reigns dropped the title. And that was in the Clash at the Castle match. The WWE piled so many extra things on to the end of this match, in addition to the molten hot Wales crowd and the fact that McIntyre is one of only maybe four men in the uppercard who has held a world title in the last couple of years, that I felt like maybe possibly for a fraction of a second Drew might win. The tiny detail that put it over the top? After the obligatory ref bump, Austin Theory came in, got knocked out, and dropped out of the picture for the rest of the show. Drew had Reigns dead to rights in the middle of the ring, in the way where a superstar has hit their finisher enough times that you know the other person won’t kick out, but of course there’s no one to count…….except that the referee who came out with Theory suddenly realizes what’s happening, and *he* slides in for the unanticipated three count. A brilliant touch. And then a wrestler who isn’t even on the roster comes out of the crowd and pulls Drew off in a twist that literally no one saw coming. Fantastic.\n\nAlso, Reigns’ match against Logan Paul weirdly snuck up close to 4 stars, and I don’t want to talk about it.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins, Royal Rumble; Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar, Summerslam; Roman Reigns vs. Riddle, Smackdown (June 17th); Roman Reigns vs. Logan Paul, Crown Jewel\n\nSmackdown Match of the Year: Roman Reigns vs. Riddle (June 17th)\n\nHonorable Mentions: Ricochet vs. Angel vs. Humberto (April 1st), Aliyah vs. Natalya (January 14th)\n\nRaw Match of the Year: Alpha Academy vs. RK-Bro vs. Kevin Owens & Seth Rollins (March 7th)\n\nHonorable Mentions: Becky Lynch vs Asuka (July 4th), Seth Rollins vs. Austin Theory (October 31st)\n\nFemale Superstar of the Year: Bianca Belair\n\nAlthough it seems a little boring, there really isn’t any other choice but Belair. The WWE has maximized her as the women’s division top face, and this consistency is a sign of her strength as an athlete and performer. I’d like to give Rousey credit for sticking around and putting in the work. I predicted she’d leave after a few months, but I was totally wrong. Not only has she wrestled at every PPV, she’s showed up at Smackdown every week. She does everything you’d ask of a regular superstar, and you’d never know that she used to pick her spots and leave when she felt like it. She lost the title twice this year too, so you’d ALSO never know about her history of not wanting to be pinned. And of course, she’s excellent on the mat and on the mic.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Ronda Rousey; Liv Morgan\n\nMale Superstar of the Year: Roman Reigns\n\nIt’s almost not even worth having this award at this point. I won’t even do an honorable mention. I acknowledge my Tribal Chief.\n\nRivalry of the Year: Sami Zayn vs. Jey Uso\n\nI won’t go so far as saying that The Bloodline includes as many good intra-faction plotlines as any stable in the history of wrestling. Nor will I say that it contains as many GREAT intra-faction plotlines as any stable in the history of wrestling. Nor will I say that the complex web of motivations, tensions, and histories more closely resemble an ensemble cast mob movie than a group of wrestlers. Nor will I say that some of the whole-group promos would be worthy main event slots during the Attitude Era. Nor will I joke that The Bloodline has as many subplots as an entire episode of Nitro by the end of the Vince Russo era. Nor will I use this as leverage to call Paul Heyman one of the five greatest wrestling managers of all time. Nor will I chime in on where Roman Reigns’ current championship run ranks among the best in WWE history. Nor will I rank the members of The Bloodline, the subplots within The Bloodline, the t-shirts The Bloodline has produced (now well over twenty-five), or the five-star matches Roman Reigns has had since he returned in his Wreck Everyone and Leave incarnation. Nor will I mention in passing how Paul Heyman and Kayla Braxton’s weekly exchanges are one of the only things I would never fast forward past in a given week.\n\nWhat I will talk about, without hyperbole or calling legacies into play, is the rivalry between Sami Zayn and Jey Uso. As more and more characters have come into the orbit of The Bloodline, the subplots have deepened in their intricacy, building on and across each other in an ever-growing web. If you’ve forgotten, The Bloodline began with a Reigns/Jey rivalry in which the Tribal Chief forced a recalcitrant Jey to do his bidding by beating him in an excellent pair of matches. Literally, I mean, because the stipulation of the second match was “if you lose, you have to do my bidding.” What began as a way to kill time while we waited for Jimmy to recover from injury turned into a genuinely compelling family feud, made all the more interesting when Jimmy actually did return. Jimmy immediately opposed Reigns’ influence on his brother, echoing the ending of the Reigns/Jey Hell in a Cell match, in which…okay, I’m going into too much detail. The point is that Jey has more reason than anyone, even Paul Heyman, to defend Reigns to the death.\n\nEnter Sami Zayn, comic foil to the Uso’s intensity, doing a “stooge who doesn’t realize he’s being used by the leader of the stable” angle with a little unhip Canadian yukyuks thrown in. Zayn quickly became a fan favorite, but Jey, who has more invested in the “blood” aspect of The Bloodline than even Reigns himself, refused to see him as a true ally. Then, after his motivations could no longer be called into question, he refused to dignify his unofficial entry into the stable. This all came to a head on the fabled October 28th episode of Smackdown during a promo that you could place in conversation with the very best of the Rock ‘n Sock Connection. If you haven’t watched the Zayn/Jey subplot burst into flames AND Sami make Roman and Jey break character in the same segment, then you’re missing one of the best things to happen in wrestling this entire year. Sami worked to try to earn the title Uce as an honorific, and the feud had mostly blown over. But now his popularity threatens to overshadow Reigns’, putting his character back in tension with everyone, including, you guessed it, Jey. Who knows where it will go?\n\nAll that to say that the umbrella of The Bloodline houses so many subplots that there can be, in a move virtually unheard of in modern-day WWE, understated slow boils like this that don’t resolve themselves neatly into PPV matches at all. Wild. And Zayn/Jey was the best of the bunch this year.\n\nRing Gear of the Year: The Judgment Day\n\nI haven’t especially enjoyed The Judgment Day, but it was better than what the WWE had been doing with all of its members before. I had grown so tired of Edge’s “I’m a wrestler from the past so I’m a megaface and here are the names of my children to add realism” schtick that it felt like a welcome change to have him do a half-baked evil deity gimmick. Damian Priest is a good wrestler who seems like he won’t ever find the right angle to take him to the next level. Finn Balor and Rhea Ripley are awesome and weren’t getting the screentime they deserved. The concept of The Judgment Day fell apart under even the most superficial level of analysis, but their theme music and ring gear were cool, and they represented an improvement for all of their members, notwithstanding the addition of Dominik Mysterio, who technically still qualifies since he’s slightly better as a heel. He’s still a bottom five wrestler, but maybe this gets him out of the bottom three? Anyway, their ring gear was an awesome blend of purple meets black meets the vaguest idea of evil, and I think they’ve probably lasted as long as they have in part because of it.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Seth Rollins; Cody Rhodes; Liv Morgan\n\nT-Shirt of the Year: Aliyah 3:17\n\nI don’t care what you think. Honestly, despite The Bloodline’s vice grip on the wrestling t-shirt game, this is the only wrestling t-shirt I’ve considered buying since we started watching almost three years ago. There’s a significant chance no one but me and Aliyah remember the moment this shirt dropped, but it was one of the highlights of the year to me. I begged the WWE (in my mind, I mean) to actually do something with this plot line, but they predictably dropped it within a month or so. Still, I’d like to think that Aliyah won the tag team championship (for literally a week) because of how I personally felt about this shirt.\n\nI have to put the honorable mention slot down here so that the image is far away enough from Aliyah’s shirt. The needlemover shirt is my personal favorite Bloodline shirt from the year, although there have been a cornucopia of contenders.\n\nHonorable Mention: Roman Reigns Needlemover\n\nTheme Music of the Year: Seth Freakin’ Rollins\n\nA slam dunk for Rollins, who now literally leads crowds in singing his theme song, though he has not gotten the face turn that’s TWO YEARS overdue. Perplexing, but the theme still rocks. And it’s possible that, basically on the strength of this song alone, he might sneak back into face territory by default.\n\nMy honorable mention will have me give way too much attention to The Judgment Day, a pretty run of the mill stable in most respects, but I mean they had killer music. I’m combining their music and Edge’s heel music in this slot because they’re even in quality and pretty much indistinguishable, although Edge’s had the benefit of including his classic line: “You think you know me? You never did.” That bit might be my favorite thing Edge has done in the last decade. Oh, also, Charlotte Flair changed her music, and no one can explain to me why. She doesn’t get an honorable mention, I just wanted to talk about it for a second. I do NOT want to talk about how they gave Gunther the perfect music and then took it away for no reason and replaced it with something generic.\n\nHonorable Mentions: The Judgment Day/Evil Edge; Solo Sikoa\n\nBreakout Star of the Year: Liv Morgan\n\nMaybe there’s a chance that Liv will return to the upper card at some point? I’m a huge Liv supporter, and the way the WWE handled her “title run” really disappointed me. I hate it when they know all along that they aren’t going to keep someone in the upper card and exploit the superstar’s fans by pretending like they will for a few months. It’s fine to give someone a chance at the title picture and then bail when you see it’s not working (like Braun Strowman), but the WWE knew from day one what they intended to do, and nothing Liv or her fans did could have changed it. I don’t want to go full blown conspiracy, but the tap out ending they booked for her first title defense and the subsequent “I tapped out but I’m still me” promo pretty clearly set her up for failure. It was an inside job the whole way.\n\nAlthough Sami Zayn has wrestled for a long time, the WWE gave him a prime slot this year as a member of The Bloodline, and I think they did in an organic way. Possibly they didn’t even plan it out like that at all. He really deserves it (and this award, which doesn’t really have any specific criteria anyway) after being pinned while caught in a giant mouse trap at Wrestlemania by Johnny Knoxville. Yeah, you thought I had forgotten about that.\n\nHonorable Mention: Sami Zayn\n\nBad Bunny Award for Best Celebrity Appearance: Logan Paul\n\nPaul submitted a predictably weak performance at Wrestlemania, and his match against The Miz at Summerslam was primed to be a train wreck, except that it turns out Paul is a legit athlete with a genuine feel for the industry. It’s one of the best Miz matches I’ve ever seen, and I’m too embarrassed to share with you how I feel about his match against Reigns at Crown Jewel. I’ll just note that Paul made the transition this year from “celebrity who wrestled” to “celebrity who wrestles.” And a really good wrestler at that.\n\nTag Team of Year: The Usos\n\nI think that if we had gotten a full year out of RK-Bro, they would have given The Usos a run for their money. But we didn’t, they didn’t, and the men’s tag team division is pretty much a ghost town. However, I do love Iyo Sky. And Dakota Kai is good I guess or whatever.\n\nHonorable Mentions: RK-Bro; Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky\n\nComeback of the Year: Cody Rhodes\n\nI had almost zero experience with Cody before Wrestlemania, so I don’t have much to say here. Rousey gets a huge honorable mention here, but I think Cody is the right choice.\n\nHonorable Mention: Ronda Rousey\n\nWorst Subplot of the Year: Wrestlemania Season\n\nThis was supposed to be the “Golden Egg Award” in honor of the terrible golden egg gimmick from last year where Vince McMahon chose Austin Theory as his new protegee based on something to do with a movie tie-in, but the true worst moment of the year was Vince stepping down because of sexual harassment allegations, only to show up on the next show to give a promo to wild applause. And then, Stephanie McMahon led a “Thank you, Vince!” chant on the next Smackdown, just to completely drive home that Vince is still a face in the WWE universe despite having to literally quit his job. Gross. Also, Austin Theory won the United States Championship twice since then and is the current champion. Also, they’re using Vince’s “Welcome to Monday Night Raw!” as the tag for the upcoming Raw anniversary thing. Just in case you weren’t 100% sure he’s still considered a good guy by the WWE.\n\nSo, I’m going back to a regular name for the award.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst buildups to Wrestlemania EVER and the worst one I’ve ever watched in real time. The WWE decided this year not to even bother setting up legitimate angles, and the basis for two fifths of the matches was throwaway garbage, with another fifth as angles so flimsy that they barely counted as angles at all. What was supposed to motivate to watch the women’s four team tag match? Why should I care about Damian Priest’s pointless heel turn? How could I get on board with those “how will they make it to Wrestlemania” angles when literally all you have to do to make it to Wrestlemania is be a rotation wrestler? This year, one of the plotlines was that Seth Rollins couldn’t find a way to get on the card, then had to wrestle in a bunch of qualifying matches to try to make it, then lost them, and then ended up on the card anyway against a mystery opponent. In what universe is that the best way to set up that match?\n\nOf the matches on this card, how many were decently set up? I’m talking about just passable angles that weren’t actively insulting to WWE fans or last-minute lazy or remarkably stupid even by wrestling standards? Of those matches, how many involved solid professional wrestlers? I’m talking about two (or more) human beings with actual wrestling experience who don’t have a known history of being bad? Of those remaining matches, how many were based in GOOD angles and had the potential to be GOOD matches? That’s maybe four or so total on a two-night card. And that didn’t include the surprise Vince McMahon/Pat MacAfee match. Yikes.\n\nThis year, the WWE banked on the idea that if the matches at Wrestlemania turned out good enough, it wouldn’t matter if they phoned in the build-up. They could do a “oh so Kevin Owens hates Texas now” subplot, as well as book a talk show segment for the main event slot of the first night (the MAIN EVENT SLOT) because they knew they the only thing people would remember was that Stone Cold’s last match was a fun brawl. They could do that Rollins angle, which was remarkably stupid even by wrestling standards, because they knew the only thing people would remember was Cody Rhodes coming back. And they could fill out the card with total nonsense because it’s a two-night show, and with all the hype on the Lesnar/Reigns match, people would have to watch anyway.\n\nIn fact, with their TV/streaming money and Saudi bribes already in place, there is nothing to stop the WWE from doing whatever they want, whether fans like me enjoy it or not. They are competing against no one. And they know it. And for this year’s Wrestlemania Season, it showed.\n\nPredictably, Wrestlemania 38 was a good PPV. It wasn’t a great one, but much of that falls on the injury Reigns suffered during The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time. If that had lived up to some of its hype and been a five star match, they could have gotten away with this clean. As it stands, they probably did anyway.\n\nBut I haven’t forgotten how dumb, how unconvincing, how half-baked the whole thing was nor will I give the WWE a pass for putting in the minimum amount of effort in what’s supposed to be the most important part of wrestling season.\n\nHonorable Mention: The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time graphic\n\nThe WWE billed the Lesnar/Reigns main event as The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time, and it almost made me stop watching. Now, I know what you’re thinking. Zack, the WWE deals exclusively in hyperbole. I still have a video of Michael Cole declaring a four man match to determine a number one contender for the Intercontinental title “one of the biggest matchies in the history of Smackdown.” So why did I find this graphic bordering on unforgivable? Especially in the wake of the Edge/Orton match from a few years ago that was billed in advance as The Greatest Wrestling Match of All-Time (also a proper noun). Why did it bother me so much?\n\nI’ll tell you why. The WWE has this whole Wrestlemania mythos. It’s completely manufactured, of course, but it’s central to the WWE’s fictional universe. And they’re surprisingly careful with it. Rarely do any of the “huge and history-making Wrestlemania moments” from year to year actually enter into Wrestlemania lore, which is as it should be. The WWE does a good job retroactively protecting the legacy of Wrestlemania by only keeping the moments that matter in their endless “best Wrestlemania moments ever” video packages. You won’t find the “monumental” Lesnar/McIntyre match from a few years ago or the “dream match” of Triple H against Sting in any of them. They pick what is actually important as well as any real sport does. If anything, they might be a little too selective given how much they show the same footage over and over. If you’re GOING to force me to watch these video packages, I wouldn’t mind a little diversity. Where is Austin’s heel turn? Or Flair’s retirement match? Or anything involving Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, or Randy Savage? I’m just saying that I wouldn’t mind seeing Owen Hart improbably beating his brother or a clip of Lawrence Taylor every once in a while.\n\nFor all of the wacky stipulation matches and embarrassing returns of old wrestlers and celebrity appearances that are Wrestlemania’s bread and butter, none of those things ever show up in the recaps of Wrestlemania history. It’s because the WWE treats Wrestlemania history with dignity. The only celebrities you see are respected ones, like Muhammad Ali and Ray Charles. Absent too are the supposedly unforgettable feel-good moments that had no impact on wrestling history. Hogan coming out to beat Yokozuna, Rey Mysterio’s title victory, the return of the Hardy Boyz. The WWE tends to the Wrestlemania narrative carefully.\n\nMy point is that, while the WWE overhypes Wrestlemania every year, they don’t actually let that impact the Wrestlemania mythos. But THIS YEAR, they decided to spit in the face of Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker and every other superstar who has made Wrestlemania what it is (as well as everyone else on this year’s show) by declaring this specific Reigns/Lesnar match The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time, even though Lesnar and Reigns have already wrestled in the main event of Wrestlemania twice, as well as the previous October.\n\nIt bothers me because it decimates my suspension of disbelief when it comes to the importance of Wrestlemania in relation to the rest of what the WWE produces. They work hard to convince me that Wrestlemania matters in a way that nothing else does, and because they put in the effort behind the scenes to make sure the show has the year’s best angles and match-ups, they manifest that idea every year. Unlike sports, the WWE can simply make Wrestlemania the most important thing of the year by planning it to be. And they treat Wrestlemania history with such uncharacteristic reserve that I don’t mind buying into the mythology. I enjoy the Wrestlemania lore and the notion that Wrestlemania is an ongoing entity of real importance. Which is good because it’s all they talk about for a third of every calendar year.\n\nBut this graphic endangered that enjoyment. Not just because it’s hyperbolic, not just because it’s too hyperbolic, but because they made it into an actual graphic and crammed it down my throat on every show like if I’d just given Miles a Christmas cookie (I mean chill out dude, you’re going to choke). They called this match The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time with an unbearable level of hubris and carelessness. Apparently, Wrestlemania’s legacy means nothing now. Apparently, none of the iconic moments in the history of the WWE matter as much as this year’s main event. And apparently I was supposed to believe that it is SO self-evident that we’ve arrived at the pinnacle of Wrestlemania’s importance that it’s okay for them to make this graphic without it undermining any of the previous Wrestlemanias. Who knew that all of those moments in the opening video of every show can’t hold a candle to this year’s main event? How can I doubt that when it’s RIGHT THERE in the graphic for me to see thirty times every Smackdown? It also led to this even more ridiculous image:\n\nThe build to the match itself included some perplexing moments, such as the means by which Lesnar entered the Royal Rumble and the ridiculous Madison Square Garden fakeout where the WWE billed a surprise opponent for Lesnar to drive up ticket sales but had planned it as an Austin Theory squash all along. They used up a lot of goodwill with that one because it was the most transparent possible bait and switch.\n\nRegardless, the Reigns/Lesnar match ended up being a dud due to Reigns’ injury (although some seemed to still like it, I guess?), but that doesn’t really have a big impact on this. There was no way for the match to live up to those expectations because they weren’t about the match’s quality but about its historical importance. I don’t know that there was anything that could have happened during this match to give it the boost in importance it would have needed to actually be The Biggest Wrestlemania Match of All-Time. But on the off chance that there WAS something, it definitely didn’t happen, and I don’t think whatever that would be was ever planned. It was just a regular “big fight feel” Reigns and Lesnar match, which we’ve already seen half a dozen times. And this was the third best one with a span of 365 days.\n\nUltimately, everything that the WWE did leading up to Wrestlemania seriously ticked me off, and even though I kept watching until well into October, I’m glad now as I type this up and revisit this garbage that I can say I’ve started checking out for months at time. They deserved it.\n\nAfter reading a children’s book on debate, I’m reflecting on my personal approach to debate and examining how I arrived at the conclusions I’ve reached and whether I ought to change them. It’s been a long trip already, and I’ve really only just started. Writing helps me with large scale self-reflection, so I’m going to share my journey with you, not because yours would look the same but because I’m already writing this stuff.\n\nHow Do I Reach Correct Conclusions? (Part 1)\n\nHere, I’m just discussing issues where there is a right answer, and I’m the one on the right side. I realized after finishing this that I only talked about theoretical issues and completely ignored the conclusions I draw about current events and other more everyday topics, so I’ll write a second part for that.\n\nFoundational Conclusions\n\nWhat are they? These are the big questions that form the very core of my approach to the world. Examples: Does God exist? Is sexism embedded in Western culture? Is art important?\n\nHow likely am I to debate about these conclusions? Unlikely. I’ve spent a lot of time arriving at these. They are the product of massive amounts of self-reflection and diligent research using the most authoritative sources (usually books!). I did not come to my Foundational Conclusions lightly nor without considering all sides on the issue. If someone disagrees with me on these, I almost wouldn’t know where to start in our debate because we differ so fundamentally on issues of such enormous importance. I certainly couldn’t do it in any other format than a loooong in-person conversation that I would need to expend significant energy and time preparing for. And almost certainly neither of us would change our minds.\n\nIn theory, I’m open to changing my Foundational Conclusions, but you’d need to completely upend my entire life to get me there. These things don’t just inform my epistemology; they ARE my epistemology. They also beg specific questions, and the answers to those questions also count as Foundational Conclusions. Examples: Is Christianity the right religion? Should I investigate whether sexism is embedded in my OWN culture? Ought I to spend time studying art?\n\nThe people I know who disagree with these Foundational Conclusions don’t discuss them with me. We purposely avoid it because we know such a conversation would almost certainly be a waste of time. And we’re both okay with that, even though in principle we shouldn’t be. I’ll talk about how we might still debate them in a roundabout way in the Medium Conclusions section.\n\nLarge Conclusions\n\nWhat are they? From these Foundational Conclusions come more specific questions that lead to more specific (but still pretty broad) conclusions. Examples: Is the Bible the inerrant Word of God? Is sexism embedded in American culture? Does it matter whether given objects are artworks or not? My answers to these questions are rock solid. I am right about them.\n\nHow likely am I to debate about these conclusions? Somewhat likely. Although it seems counterintuitive, I’ve probably spent more time working on my Large Conclusions than the Foundational Conclusions. You work on the Foundational Conclusions in your twenties, and you live your life based on those. By the time you’re 35, it would take an improbable mountain of evidence to cause you to even doubt them, let alone change them. You ARE these conclusions.\n\nThe Large Conclusions come next, but they are a little more subject to debate. Because of that, I actively spend time thinking about objections to them. For example, I am currently reading a book called The Big Book of Bible Difficulties, a comprehensive reference text that provides a defense of pretty much every possible question regarding the inerrancy of the Bible. Now, I recognize that confirmation bias informs my intake of new information. I’m reading this book instead of its atheist counterpart because it comes from a perspective I already agree with. On the other hand, if I’m right about the Large Conclusions (and I’ve done the work to get there), why would I read a full-length book arguing for what I already know is an erroneous conclusion? It makes more sense to read a book defending the Bible from the perspective that supports my Large Conclusion. After all, I’m correct about it.\n\nDefend is the right word. If I debate about my Large Conclusions, it is not to re-assess them but to defend them. I’ve already put in the effort to make sure they reflect objective truth. However, I also know that people object to my Large Conclusions on reasonable grounds, which is why I invest so much time in researching these objections. This book of Bible answers argues for the inerrancy of the Bible in the face of intelligent objections that I need help addressing.\n\nI am happy to debate concerning my Large Conclusions, but, as with the Foundational Conclusions, these debates would likely need to be in-person, would take a lot of time to conduct, and would require preparation. But I would do it if I could because it’s a possibility, however small, that I could convince my debate partner that I’m right. In fact, I’d probably work harder for that debate. After all, many of my friends are in their thirties. What are the chances I convince another 35-year-old that they’re wrong about whether God exists in a single conversation? In ten conversations? I definitely have a moral imperative to do it, but it’s a big mountain to climb. With these Large Conclusions though, I’ve at least got a shot, so I regularly approach them as if I were a detractor. I read this book of Bible answers from the perspective of someone who doesn’t believe in Biblical inerrancy to test the strength of my conclusions. I’m right every time, but it’s important to sharpen your blades.\n\nMedium Conclusions\n\nWhat are they? These conclusions are raised by the Large Conclusions, but the answers don’t necessarily follow from them. You could easily hold the same Large Conclusions as me but hold different Medium Conclusions. Examples: Is there a right way to study the Bible? Does sexism drive the American entertainment industry? Is creative non-fiction art?\n\nHow likely am I to debate these conclusions? Likely, under specific circumstances. These conclusions are smaller and even more specific than the Large Conclusions. Because of that, I am more willing to debate them. People who hold the same Foundational and Large Conclusions as me share the same basic approach to the world, meaning we have so much common ground that debate could be productive. I believe strongly that I have reached these Medium Conclusions logically and that I got them right, but I haven’t built my entire world around them. I’m open to the idea that my take on them has flaws; not that it’s entirely wrong, just that it might require adjustment.\n\nI *want* to argue about these Medium Conclusions. It’s loads of fun, and, because I know I’m right, I don’t have to worry about uprooting a significant portion of mental world. Arguing about Medium Conclusions is a favorite pastime of mine, especially since I can do it over social media, which makes it a hobby rather than something I have to carve out a whole day for (not particularly feasible for a father of a toddler). Many intelligent people whose opinions I respect hold different or even opposite views on these, and debating with them refines my defense for future debates, preparing me for those objections when I encounter them again. Additionally, although I have definitely reached the right answers on these, some aspects of my Medium Conclusions may have holes, so these debates can help strengthen them. For example, although I am correct that creative non-fiction isn’t art, I may be wrong about whether certain types of works count as non-fiction. And some (but not all) of the ways I reached these Medium Conclusions may simply be wrong. I’m willing to admit to that if faced with very, very convincing arguments. That’s exciting to me.\n\nEven more exciting is the potential that I could convince my debate partner that THEY are wrong. This has actually happened before, and it’s an awesome thing because I’m right and I moved another person onto the right side of the issue. In my opinion, the best and possibly the only way to get someone to change a Large Conclusion is to change their Medium Conclusion and revisit the Large Conclusion (or let them do it on their own) much later after they’ve had time to process the implications of that change.\n\nThe only problem with debating Medium Conclusions is time and energy. In the past, I’ve given a lot of time to rigorous debate on these issues. Now, I just don’t have as much time. Someone challenged me recently on my conclusion that creative non-fiction is not art. I could have spent 2,000 words defending my position, and she’s the kind of person who would at least consider changing her mind about it if presented her with convincing counter-evidence. But I didn’t have 2,000 words worth of time that day. In the past, I would have made time for it, but I can’t always do that now.\n\nBut, Zack Rearick King of Hypocrites, you say! Haven’t you invested an outrageous amount of time on this post?\n\nI have. This is upfront time, and I’ve worked on this post for weeks. Debating takes much more time, even if I end up writing fewer words. For one, debates happen in real time, whereas I have worked on this post in spare moments at my own convenience. Online debates, my usual format, require me to break my arguments into smaller chunks so that I don’t get TL;DNRed, which I absolutely loathe doing. There’s a reason formal debates use the opposite format. Arguing in this piecemeal way is much less effective, so I frequently refuse to do it and then get TL;DNRed, making the whole thing a big waste. I’ve also had this specific creative non-fiction debate so many times that I kind of feel like I’ve said my piece on it, even though that’s unfair to my friend because she’s never seen those points. It would have made sense to save one of those posts for future use maybe, but I didn’t, and I can only argue about this so many times in my life before I lose interest in it, especially since I can probably anticipate all of my friend’s points and her counterpoints to my rebuttals.\n\nWorst of all, debating of any kind means you regularly run into responses filled with logical fallacies, which necessitate individual refutation and which run the risk of turning the debate into an unproductive firestorm.\n\nArguing about Medium Conclusions is a favorite hobby I currently don’t have the capacity to do. It’s sad, but I’m 35, and my child is an adorable prodigy, so I pick my spots. Re-engaging with these arguments with a debate partner requires energy I already used teaching my son comparative adjectives of equality in Spanish today.\n\nSmall Conclusions\n\nWhat are they? Fun stuff! Small Conclusions come on the most specific possible scale. I have investment in them but not high investment because of their specificity and relative unimportance. Examples: Why am I okay with men having long hair in light of 1 Corinthians 11? Where does the phrase “man tears” fall on the spectrum of sexism? Is Walden fiction or non-fiction? Note that, unlike the previous categories, Small Conclusions do not assume yes or no answers.\n\nHow likely am I to debate about these? Very likely! These issues hold minor importance to me, and I have committed a proportional amount of time reaching my Small Conclusions. They also have no deep epistemological implications. Intellectually, they’re small potatoes. This makes arguing about them a feasible time commitment for me, especially since these arguments can (and frequently do) happen on social media, where I spend a lot of my Internet time.\n\nAlthough I’m generally right about my Small Conclusions (because I’m so super smart), I’m obviously more likely to have gotten them wrong than any of the previous types, which makes debating them more fun since I have found myself changing sides on them. And the flip side also holds. I can call to mind more than a few times I’ve changed someone else’s Small Conclusion just on Facebook. How fun is that?\n\nMy wife and I have an awesome marriage. I sometimes see people asking successful married couples what one piece of advice they would give for the creation and maintenance of a healthy and happy marriage. I always felt like a couple of truisms (“Communication is key,” “Never say ‘always’ or ‘never’ when you fight”) isn’t really substantial advice, but I never take the time to write out my own thoughts. So, now I’m doing it. I am qualified to at least offer advice, whether you feel compelled to take it or not, because, as I said, our marriage is awesome, and it has been for the entire five years since our wedding, plus the three years we were together before then.\n\nMy wife and I have a lot of mini-obsessions. The Oscars, fast food chicken sandwiches, the Bachelorette. One of them is relationship advice books and quizzes. For Christmas, she got me a Couples quiz book, a fun game where you try to guess how your partner would respond to questions about leisure time and desired travel destinations. Even now, but especially during the years leading up to our wedding, we read scores and scores of books and articles on how to have the healthiest possible marriage.\n\nOf all of these books, the one I’d recommend the most is What Makes Love Last? by John Gottman. I won’t talk about the book in detail, but I will say that we tracked down a bunch of other writings that came out of the research the Gottman Institute collected and that one of the books we read contained a statistic that I think every couple, married or otherwise, should be aware of.\n\nHere’s the statistic: Out of every eight nice things a person does for their spouse, the spouse only notices one of them.\n\nI’ll give some practical applications of this in a second, but those are just suggestions. They are not my actual advice. My advice is just this: Keep that statistic in your mind during your day-to-day life. Out of every eight nice things you do for your spouse, she’s only going to notice one of them. And it goes both ways because you only notice one out of every eight nice things your spouse does for you.\n\nSo, that’s my advice. I honestly think you can figure out ways to implement this newfound knowledge on your own. I have a few takeaways that have been useful in my own marriage, but I don’t pretend to be a relationship expert. I have a successful marriage, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that my extended thoughts will be helpful to you. That’s why my advice is literally just the statistic. Plus, like I said, I feel like you can incorporate this statistic into your marriage without my help; the implications seem self-explanatory. Still, since we’re here, here are some practical applications that I think are beneficial.\n\n1. Be prepared to be underappreciated because “nice things” covers a lot of ground\n\nOne out of eight. That doesn’t seem too bad, until you realize how quickly those numbers add up. If you’re feeling really grateful for your spouse and decide to go out of your way to do twenty-four nice things for your her over the course of a couple of days, she’ll only notice three of them. Three! It’s easy to feel like you’re not getting enough credit for what you bring to your marriage when someone goes 3/24 in the “appreciating what you do for them” department.\n\nHow could that even happen? Doesn’t your spouse care about the stuff you do for them? Isn’t that an important part of marriage?\n\nI’ll explain. Part of it is the nature of what counts as “nice things.” The answer? Everything. Obviously, the grand gestures you make are included, the flowers you bring home because your spouse had a bad day, the presents you give on her birthday, the poems you wrote when you were first dating.\n\nBut most of the nice things you do are little ones. Living together, as most married couples do, is the breeding ground for unnoticed niceness. Because you and all of your stuff occupy the same physical space as your spouse and all of hers, the opportunities for doing nice things are endless.\n\nSome of these are by their nature always going to go unnoticed, such as letting your partner take more of the covers on a cold night or picking up her keys when you see that they’ve fallen on the floor. These are things that you wouldn’t reasonably expect them to notice, but they do go into your “nice things done for your spouse” totals. If you feel like you don’t actually do that many nice things, it’s probably because you’re only thinking of the really noteworthy stuff. When you clean out her travel mug in the morning before she goes to work because she forgot to do it the night before, that counts. You’re probably doing a bunch of nice stuff without even realizing it, and your spouse *definitely* isn’t realizing it. At least not seven out of the eight times you do it.\n\nAlso unlikely to be noticed are the small and silent sacrifices you make for your spouse. Maybe you want to get Chinese for dinner, have in fact been DYING for Chinese for weeks and have made that clear no less than three times, but, on the one night of the week you have budgeted to eat out, she wants Italian. You could push for Chinese, but you decide to be nice. It’s not a gigantic sacrifice, but it’s a sacrifice nonetheless. And maybe you even specifically *don’t* want Italian. You know if you brought this up to her, she would drop it, and you’d finally get your longed-for egg drop soup. But you see the radiant joy in her eyes as she talks about ricotta and cannolis, and you decide to just make it work. You can find something, and eventually you’ll do Chinese down the line. It’s a small sacrifice, and by its very nature, it will go unmentioned and thus unappreciated. But it IS a sacrifice, and it also goes into your totals.\n\nThese are all things, the keys and the covers and the Italian food, that you accept upfront never to be acknowledged for. If you really wanted to, you could bring them up, but it would almost defeat the point of doing them in the first place. So, combining those small sacrifices and the aforementioned grand gestures, that’s a significant chunk of your niceness right there. Your spouse will almost always notice the grand gestures (they’re grand!) and almost never notice the unseen key-rescuings (they’re unseen!) and silent sacrifices (they’re silent!), so the former and latter would cancel each other out statistically, except that you likely don’t make grand gestures every week, whereas you pick up keys and eat Italian when you want Chinese much more often. The numbers aren’t in your favor here.\n\nBut those are two extremes, things that basically can’t go unnoticed and things that you don’t anticipate your spouse ever noticing. There is a lot of stuff in the middle. Possibly MOST of the stuff is in the middle.\n\nWhat are those middle ground things? For starters, there are things your spouse wants you to do that you don’t want to do. Sometimes, these are issues of simple preference, such as towel-folding style. Sometimes, these are issues of inconvenience, such as when your spouse wants you to take the garbage out in the middle of the week even though you normally do it once a week and it’s like POURING DOWN rain outside, but you do it anyway and get soaked.\n\nSometimes, these are larger issues, both temporary and permanent. At some point in your marriage, you and your spouse will come to a rough division of labor with household and financial chores. It will not be entirely to your liking. This is a semi-permanent arrangement; you agreed to clean out the litterbox, and now it’s basically your responsibility until the day you die (unless the cat dies first). There’s some bargaining in there, but I doubt there has ever been a marriage where both people come away with ONLY chore assignments that they want to do, if for nothing else than because there aren’t a ton of fun chores. There will be times when doing your assigned chores is a major pain, times when your chore load will outweigh your partners’ (now we have four cats?!), and times when you will feel like you’re doing all the chores, even though the division was fairly negotiated initially. What’s more, the division is subject to change, and you will sometimes have to temporarily (or even permanently) take on some of the chores that your spouse agreed originally that she would do. I’m a stay-at-home parent, so it makes sense for me to do more of the household chores.\n\n(Although, to be honest, I don’t do nearly as many as most stay-at-home parents probably do since I spend most of my time spelling words with choo-choo trains, saying “Oh! Amazing Teasdale dunk!”, and writing blog posts. I’m an inattentive and inconsistent homemaker, but I feel like I make up for it by being a more attentive parent and being more consistently willing to assist my son in finding the beaver behind the felt flap on the first page of this book he’s into today.)\n\nChores are a huge chunk of the nice things you do for your spouse, and a proportionally larger chunk of the things you do for her that she doesn’t notice. In an ideal world, you would be okay with that, and you probably mostly are, but there are times when you want to be appreciated for a specific chore without explicitly drawing attention to it yourself. Maybe you did one of her chores. Maybe you did a one-time chore that could have been either person’s responsibility. Maybe you did regular a chore that was more difficult than normal. Or maybe you just want to be occasionally acknowledged for performing your agreed-upon chores on a daily basis. These are all reasonable ways to feel, and sometimes your spouse will tell you how grateful she is for what you did. But, statistically, it’s more likely that she won’t even notice, not to mention the possibility that we haven’t even discussed of her noticing but never getting around to thanking you for it.\n\nHow can you handle this? The standard advice here is to do these nice things for your spouse without intending to be noticed for them. That way, you’re not upset when it doesn’t happen, and it’s just a nice boost when it does. There’s wisdom to that, of course, but it’s an unrealistic goal. My practical advice is to just be prepared to be consistently underappreciated for the majority of nice things that you do. There are times when the fact that you’re underappreciated will bother you. I would obviously recommend talking with your spouse when that happens, since, again, she is statistically going to be simply oblivious to how you feel, but you won’t always do that. Sometimes, you’ll just silently grumble about it. That’s a normal part of marriage. It’s pretty much unavoidable. Like any of the other difficult aspects of marriage, you just have to know upfront that it’s going to happen and that it doesn’t inherently represent a flaw in your relationship or your spouse. It’s a statistical certainty. She’s doing her best here.\n\n2. Remember that you are being equally unappreciative\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to deal with the fact that you’re being underappreciated is to remember that you’re only working with one side of the story. While you’re going on doing eight nice things and being *criminally* underappreciated for all but one of them, you are also only noticing one in eight of the nice things your spouse is doing for YOU.\n\nPause and reflect on that one. Your spouse is awesome, and she’s doing nice stuff for you every day. You try to be grateful for it, but some of it slips by unnoticed, even in the period of hyper-awareness for your spouse’s niceness that might follow you reading this blog post. In fact, MOST of it slips by unnoticed. In fact, even if you make a Herculean effort to notice every nice thing your spouse does for you, the odds are stacked so highly against you that you can only make in small dent in the gap. Best case scenario you get to…three out of eight? Maybe four if you’re REALLY working on it? And that period of hyper-awareness isn’t going to last forever. Fifty percent is probably your highest, pie-in-the-sky possible percentage, and you won’t even sustain it. Everything I said about the small things you do for your partner are being done by your partner for you, and the same principal of underappreciatedness apply.\n\nBe aware of this, especially when you start to feel your dissatisfaction with how underappreciated you are mounting. It may be mounting your partner as well. This leads me to final piece of practical advice…\n\n3. Use the following weekly routine to check in with your partner\n\nIn my substantial research on this issue, I found a really helpful activity to help both people in your marriage feel appreciated. It comes from the following article, but I’ll explain it briefly. Elisha and I have been doing it every Sunday since October, and now it’s something we look forward to every week.\n\nThe article suggests that you check in weekly with your partner by asking them two questions. When Elisha and I do it, we make an event out of it; we go on a long morning walk and get fun coffees. It makes it a weekly treat, and I think customizing it to make it a treat for your relationship will make you more likely to do it and more excited about it during the week, although the rewards ultimately come from the conversation rather than the white chocolate mochas.\n\nSo, what are the two questions? The first one is “What would you like to be acknowledged for from this week?” This is different from “How are you?”, which will almost certainly result in a generic response. As the article says, the acknowledgment question “immediately sends the message to me [the addressee] that the often thankless and mostly unnoticed work I do to keep our family humming matters. Being asked what I would like to be acknowledged for launches an internal inquiry that truly gives me pause. Hmm, what would I like to be acknowledged for? What is something I’ve done lately that deserves a little credit?…External appreciation has tremendous value, but here’s the thing: the real juice actually lives in the way that speaking my accomplishment out aloud (no matter how big or small) allows me to acknowledge myself. I get to unearth and underscore my tiny triumphs for the sake of my own recognition and notice.”\n\nThis question requires you to actually think about yourself and the things you’ve done for your spouse during the week, and, perhaps even more importantly, it gives you permission to give yourself credit for something you’ve done in an organic way that doesn’t make you feel like you’re bragging or fishing for a compliment. Once you get into the rhythm of doing this weekly, it will be second nature, and the implication that your partner has somehow failed by not having already noticed this things will be completely gone.\n\nThe second question is “What would you like me to know about your life?” This is different from the standard “What’s going on?”, which will almost certainly result in a generic response. Again, I quote the article: “It’s not asking for a laundry list of to-dos. It’s recognizing that even married people, who live their lives in parallel, have their own distinct worlds they move in, and it invites each other into those worlds…It’s not always groundbreaking. Sometimes I want him to know that I think the cats have fleas again, that he really needs to move those boxes into the attic, that I’m really tired of how much chicken we eat for dinner, or that I started listening to a new podcast that I think he’d love, too…Not every conversation is going to have us baring our souls, but some will. The point is the opportunity, the invitation, is there if we choose it. What bubbles or is beckoned to the shallows gives us the chance to reveal a glimpse into our world neither our partner nor even sometimes ourselves knew was incubating.”\n\nI know these will seem forced at first, but I really recommend powering through that because the eventual payoff of making it an established routine is huge.\n\n4(?). Bonus Advice: Cohabitate before marriage if possible\n\nI want to take a moment to add in a bit of extra advice that I can’t universally recommend because it doesn’t make sense for every couple. So much of having a successful marriage is being able to just live in the same space together. I highly recommend cohabitating with your partner, even if it’s just for a little while, BEFORE you get married to make sure you can do that without it sabotaging your relationship. Some people feel like they can’t do this on moral grounds, particularly people who are against pre-marital sex and believe that cohabitating with their partner will inevitably result in that. My wife and I waited for marriage, but we still cohabitated for a significant period of time beforehand. Not everyone can do this, and that’s not a judgment of the value of your relationship. Obviously, there are other factors, economics chief among them, that might make cohabitation unfeasible. But, if you CAN do it, I really think you ought to. If nothing else, it’s nice to get some of the kinks in the process of meshing two lifestyles into one worked out so that they don’t add to your inevitable honeymoon comedown, as they do for many couples. Discovering that your spouse loads the dishwasher the wrong way isn’t a fun way to start off your post-honeymoon life together, so it’s nice to get that out of the way in advance.\n\nAnd I’m really serious when I say that some relationships legitimately can’t survive cohabitation, even ones that were strong beforehand. If you’ve ever had roommates, you know that there are some people who simply cannot live together. There’s a chance that one of those unlucky combinations is you and your partner. Figure this out in advance if you can because it’s not something you want to realize after you’ve already made a lifetime commitment to a person who cares way too much about dryer sheets. Cohabitation also gives you the chance to see some of the little idiosyncrasies of your partner’s minute-to-minute existence, and, while the romcom trope of a person not being marriage material because they say “aaah!” after they drink a cup of water is way over the top, it’s still helpful to know these sorts of things in advance.\n\nWhen during the Disney movie catalog does Disney become DISNEY? There are two generally accepted positions on the subject. Some believe that the moment is the release of the first feature length film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Some think that it’s Cinderella.\n\nSteamboat Willie people are pretentious and don’t have a leg to stand on.\n\nHere’s why Cinderella is the answer. Cinderella is the first true iteration of the Disney theme. Why are we talking about all of these disparate movies anyway? Why is it meaningful to say that something is a “Disney movie” rather than just a kid’s movie? What is it about Disney that makes talking about its entire canon fun, even though it includes The Black Cauldron and Chicken Little?\n\nUltimately, Disney is the modern day version of the fairy tales and folk stories that we’ve been telling children (and ourselves) as far back as history traces. Good things happen to good people. If you believe in yourself and in your dream, your wishes will come true. Hard work pays off, and bad guys lose. The ethics are questionable, and the real world application even more so, but that’s the reason that we tell stories at bedtime instead of recapping the nightly news. We all already live in an unfair world where good and bad things seem to happen at random, and dreams don’t always come true. We want to believe that things can be different.\n\nI’m not telling you that we should believe that things can be different. Whether the way the world actually works is compatible with your moral system is up to you. What I’m saying is that all of us want to believe in something and that Disney gives us the stories we want to tell. It isn’t only Disney that does this, but Disney found a new way to do it, a very specific way (full length animated features). And it’s been doing that for longer and with more success than anyone else. Disney invented the animated feature in the same way that The Beatles invented pop music. It didn’t, but who cares? It still did.\n\nBeyond that, Disney came up with a very specific version of this story. There’s a formula to it. This formula, which is present to some degree in all of the Disney films (although not always in obvious ways and not always with success), is the heart of Disney. It’s the reason that we care whether a film is a Disney film or not. It’s the reason that Mickey ears on a car antenna matter and and the reason that the sight of the real life Cinderella’s castle at Disney World makes our heart skip. Disney has a message for you and your children. Wanting to hear that message is why we keep coming back to the metaphorical Disney World time and time again. It’s where the magic happens.\n\nThe message is captured in the following lines from “When You Wish Upon a Star,” the official Disney theme song as decided upon by Disney itself: “If your heart is in your dreams, / no request is too extreme.”\n\nThat’s Disney-talk. Everyone has a dream, Disney says. If you really believe in your dream, and you really believe in yourself, you can make that dream come true, no matter how impossible it seems. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a down on her luck orphan or an anthropomorphic fox or a cat voiced by Miley Cyrus.\n\nThis is magic. It can’t happen in the real world, except on very rare occasions, which is why the serious application of it to real world problems is derogatorily called “magical thinking.” But in Disney World, it’s an inevitability. In Disney World, no request is too extreme. In Disney World, anyone can be anything.\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. You have to be a good person (or cat or fox or whatever), and you have to do the right thing. Good dreams come true. Bad dreams, even if they are realized momentarily, do not. You have to be kind and selfless and willing to put the interests of others before your own.\n\nAnd you don’t get all of your dreams either. Just one. Just the one. Just the dream you put your heart into. Not your dream of Taco Bell bringing back the Mexican pizza or your dream of America taking “One Nation under God” off of the dollar bill. Just the big one.\n\nMaybe you want to fall in love. Maybe you want to be a part of something big, really big. Maybe you want to be a part of society and no longer an outcast. Maybe you want the respect of your father or the job you’ve pictured yourself doing as long as you can remember. But you just get the one.\n\nIt’s a bit more complicated than it seemed at first (and, again, possibly ethically irresponsible), but it’s ultimately the story we want to tell ourselves. We want Disney World to be real.\n\nAnd if it were real, then the entrance to the Disney World utopia would be through Cinderella’s castle, just like in the real world Disney World theme park. Why? Because Cinderella is the first movie that realizes the Disney formula in full.\n\nThe complete Disney movie formula is as follows: Likable protagonist has a dream that seems like it couldn’t possibly come true. The odds are against her. But she truly believes in herself, and she puts her whole heart into this one dream. It’s all she wants, and she’s willing to do whatever it takes to make it come true. Obstacles are thrown her way. They seem insurmountable. But she never gives up on herself or her dream.\n\nBut, and this is crucial, despite her singular focus, it’s not exactly true that she’s willing to do ANYTHING for her dream. She is also a good person. She cares about being kind to others, about things being fair, about doing the right thing, about mercy and forgiveness, about the value of friendship and love. If the opportunity comes for her to realize her dream that would require her to compromise her integrity, she will do the right thing. She will sacrifice the thing she wants most in the world because she is a good person.\n\nAnd then, improbably her dream comes true. It couldn’t possibly have come true. But it does. That’s Disney magic. This formula doesn’t play out in Snow White because Snow White is barely a character at all, and so we (and she, honestly) aren’t really invested in her dream coming true. We assume her dream must be that some day her prince will come, but we don’t care. We aren’t given any real reason to care. It doesn’t matter to us because she doesn’t seem like a real person. She’s like an animated version of Samuel Richardson’s Pamela.\n\nPinocchio doesn’t satisfy this formula either. The story is about Pinocchio, but at its heart it’s really about Geppetto. Pinocchio himself is the dumbest Disney protagonist aside from Winnie the Pooh (whose dim-wittedness is charming, and who, as I outlined in a previous post, isn’t the true protagonist of his movie). Because of how dumb he is, Pinocchio’s stupidity is mostly just frustrating. Do you really feel bad for him when he’s turned into a donkey? Do you really want his wishes to come true? In fact, he isn’t even really a good person/puppet, which is why a moralizing cricket has to constantly keep watch over him.\n\nDumbo sucks. Maybe he has a dream or maybe not. Whatever. I don’t care about Dumbo.\n\nSo these first three movies lack step one of the Disney formula, which is having protagonists who we care about. With this established (and acknowledging that Fantasia is an isolated film in the Disney canon), I think that the best case for an early inauguration of Disney qua Disney can be made for Bambi, the fifth Disney full length animated feature. After all, aren’t we invested in Bambi’s happiness? Don’t we want his dreams to come true? Why can’t Bambi be the first “Disney” movie?\n\nOf course, I have an answer. What differentiates Cinderella and Bambi is the degree to which the main character’s dreams weigh on us as an audience. For Cinderella, in the classic Disney format, her dreams are high stakes. Either she goes to the ball and wins the heart of Prince Charming or she spends the rest of her life in squalor and slavery at the beck and call of women who hate her and an evil cat. We do care plenty about Bambi, especially after the death of his mother (still one of Disney’s most surprising and moving moments), but we get the sense that his twitter-pattion is just a crush. We’re happy for him when he gets Faline to fall for him, but, if he hadn’t, he would probably just have found another doe. He’s awkward and orphaned, but he isn’t living a miserable life that hinges entirely Faline’s love. He’ll be fine if she turns him down, and so his happily ever after doesn’t have the cathartic rush of joy that Cinderella’s does. There isn’t enough tension there for the pay-off to be truly “Disney.”\n\nBambi doesn’t really, deeply want his dream to come true. Not in the same way that Cinderella does. And so it isn’t particularly magical when it does. In fact, you could argue that it isn’t his “dream” at all. This is why the entrance to Disney World is through Cinderella’s castle. Cinderella is the first truly MAGICAL Disney movie. It’s still one of the most magical, in my opinion. Her transformation is the quintessential Disney moment. Magic makes a good person’s lifelong dream come true. That’s what Disney is really all about.\n\nPeople frequently ask me “What do you do all day as a stay-at-home parent?” I find myself at a loss when this question is put to me, and I usually respond with something like, “Oh, I guess nothing. You know. We just hang out. It’s the best job in the world!”\n\nWhich is partly true. It is definitely the best job in the world, but it’s impossible to do nothing for an entire day. It’s more that what we do is so unremarkable or so context-driven that it isn’t worth articulating. But people keep asking me, and I can’t blame them because I wondered about what stay-at-home parents do myself before I became one. So, here’s a breakdown of what we do in the Rearick house on your average day.\n\n6-7:30 am: Somewhere in here, Miles wakes up. Without opening my eyes, I change his diaper (if he needs it), warm up a bottle that has been refrigerated for this purpose, and feed it to him.\n\n7:30-8:30 am: After feeding him the bottle, I rock him in hopes of getting to go back to sleep, a process that takes anywhere from 15-40 minutes. About one third of the time, he goes back to sleep, and then so do I. The other two thirds of the time, I continue to fruitlessly rock him while singing his lullaby (“Titania’s Lullaby” from A Midsummer Night’s Dream) on loop. Eventually, I give up. These times are approximate, by the way, since I still have my eyes closed.\n\n8:30-9:00 am: Miles wakes up, if he wasn’t awake already. I put him in his crib with a book (Colors from a publisher called Alphaprints) to keep him occupied and return to bed. Although I cannot truly fall asleep, since he is not quiet even while he’s reading, I pretend that I am sleeping for the sake of my mental health. His chatter goes from stream-of-consciousness remarks made to himself to observations on the time of day (“Morning! New day!”) and objects in our room to, finally, an endless series of “Dada! Dada! Dada!” This last series goes on, first joyously then increasingly more needlingly, until my alarm goes off at 9.\n\n9:00-9:05 am: I get up, put on my robe and socks, and turn off the nightlight. I go over to the crib, where Miles is now yelling “Dada morning!” or “Good morning!” An elaborate ritual of catchphrases, sing-song, tickling, and kisses ensues.\n\n9:05-9:10 am: We go to the bathroom, where I brush my teeth, put on deodorant, and run a comb through my hair. I throw The Six Pistols on shuffle while I go through my morning routine. I take two pills of the anti-seizure medication that works as a mood stabilizer to level out my bipolar. I pick out my clothing for the day, putting on my awesome Dude Love shirt, which is pictured below.\n\n9:10-9:30 am: Another diaper change, if needed. We go into the kitchen, where Miles chooses among grapes, oranges, or a banana for his breakfast. Since he ate four oranges the previous day, I eliminate oranges from the options, and he chooses a banana. I cut it up and put it on his high chair. While he eats, I listen to my current audiobook, the thirteenth book in Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. It’s called The Penultimate Peril, and it’s quite good, as good as the third book (The Wide Window) and the ninth book (The Hostile Hospital), but not as good as the first two books in the series. I wash the dishes and clean the litterbox, making sure that Miles is actually eating and not playing with his food, although this is rarely a problem at breakfast. Then, I pull a chair into the nursery and draw the blinds. Here’s what the nursery looks like at the beginning of the day:\n\nI then make myself a cup of coffee, using the Ristretto pod for our cool Nespresso coffee maker. I top my coffee off with Oreo Cookies n’ Creme creamer and a generous helping of Nitro whipped cream.\n\n9:30-10:00 am: This is my allotted daily time to drink my coffee and play on my phone while Miles plays independently. Today, he has chosen blocks as his morning focus. I go through my regular routine of the websites on the News app that I check daily, hitting the major categories of my current interests. Here’s what my News app page looks like:\n\nIt’s not a particularly exciting day in the world of Internet articles, but I do learn that there’s a woman named Marianna Simnett who is doing some interesting work with short films. I try to find out how to watch her film The Bird Games, which seems promising, but it was only available online for a short window and that has elapsed. I make a note to check back on this woman later to see if she does anything else cool. I also learn how the Bachelor and Bachelorettes know the names of all their potential suitors during the rose ceremonies. Here’s a sample of the kind of articles I’ve read.\n\nI text my wife good morning and set an alarm on my phone for 10:30 to remind me to take medication for my gastrointestinal ailments. I’ve learned that the most reliable way to make sure that I take it on time is to set a new alarm every day, even though that doesn’t make any sense in 2021. Miles gets tired of the blocks and wants me to hang out with him around 9:50, but we’re still in the phone-time window, and it’s a necessary self-care period for me, so I redirect him with Theodora Teapot.\n\nDuring this time, my wife makes a brief appearance in between meetings to say good morning, which is always fun when it’s happening and a little less fun when she leaves. I redirect Miles with the blocks, which he now has a renewed interest in since he’s already forgotten that he just spent like half an hour playing with them.\n\n9:30-10:00 am: I have a few errands to run, so I get Miles dressed. I put him in a rainbow shirt to match the tie-dye of my Dude Love shirt. It’s important to coordinate.\n\nI make sure the diaper bag is replenished of the necessities for a short car ride (water, a snack cup, a couple of books, a robot letter), and then we put on our shoes and head out. Before leaving, I select a toy for him to play with on the way. Since he’s in a good mood and our errands won’t take much time, I don’t anticipate any problems, meaning that I don’t have to select a top-tier toy. Since I’m wearing my Dude Love shirt, I go with Kooky Cat, a Beanie Baby from my wife’s childhood that has been given a new name to reflect his new Dude Love gimmick. I remind Miles that Kooky Cat’s catchphrase is “Ow, have mercy!” and he cheerfully repeats it back to me.\n\nOur errands go smoothly. I have to drop off a bag of Nespresso pods at the post office so that they can be recycled. Nespresso sends you a bag every time you buy more sleeves of the pods, and I am in charge of putting the used pods into the bag. They can’t be mailed from home because they’re shipped via USPS, but it makes me feel like I’m doing my part for the environment to recycle them rather than just throwing them away, so I’m willing to make the trip.\n\nI also have to go Walgreens to get more of my gastrointestinal medication. The price for the medication is outrageous because it’s the beginning of the year, and we haven’t met our deductible, but there isn’t much we can do about it. The line is long, but Miles doesn’t mind. I listen to Say Podcast and Die, a Goosebumps podcast where a pair of English professors who also happen to be a lesbian couple go through the series book by book. I don’t normally like podcasts, but the ladies are funny, and the final section of their show, in which they connect the relevant book to horror films and literature, often yields productive insight. Today’s book is The Phantom of the Auditorium, which is a decent but not great one. I’m still at the beginning of the podcast, when they summarize the books and make humorous comments on it, so there’s not much to report.\n\n10:30-11:00 am: We get home as my alarm goes off, and I take my medication. Miles requests to draw, so I pull out his My First Big Book of Dinosaurs coloring book and put him in his high chair. He has a variety of different crayon boxes/bags, but today I’m feeling lazy, so I give him his first ever crayons, which are in a bag because the box got destroyed. They are a bit woebegone, but they are also easier to keep up with than the homemade ones my little sister gave him for Christmas, and he can use all of them at once, unlike the big box of 64. He draws independently for a while, then begins asking for me to contribute, by which I mean he asks me to draw specific numbers and the letters RWO. I comply.\n\n11:00-11:30 am: Lunchtime for me, which means a sandwich made of leftover barbecue that my parents made last Saturday, a Cosmic Brownie, and a can of Mountain Dew Major Melon. I’m currently working my way through all the Wrestlemanias that occurred between when I stopped watching in 2002 and when we picked it up again in 2019. I’m on Wrestlemania 27 right now, and the match we watch is Michael Cole vs. Jerry Lawler. Miles enjoys a tasty snack of raisins while I slog through an awful gimmick match that is particularly embarrassing now that Michael Cole is a respectable announcer again. Also, someone named Jack Swagger is involved. Yikes.\n\n11:30 am-12:00 pm: We head into the nursery. I have to do manual entry for a freelance editing project I’m doing for a friend, so I work on that while Miles plays independently. I ask him what he wants to do, and he begins by asking for his choo-choo train, but, as we all know, the choo-choo train is ineligible as a toy until I’m done with manual entry. He elects to read instead, going through a large pile of books while I fix comma errors and typos. The books in question are a board book version of Anne of Green Gables, Nevermore (a board book version of Poe’s “The Raven,”), and The ABCs of Space.\n\n12:00-12:30 pm: I’ve finally finish the manual entry, and the choo-choo train is now in play. “Choo-choo train!” Miles exclaims with a level of pure joy unmatched by anything I’ve experienced since the last time I had the Popeye’s chicken sandwich.\n\nHere’s the deal with the choo-choo train and why it can only be an available toy at specific times.\n\nIt’s a great toy. Along with the letters that stick to our fridge, it has helped Miles learn how to spell five words (Miles, cat, dog, love, and Luna, which is his toy wolf named after the real-life wolf he sees at the animal park we frequent). It also teaches him problem solving because the magnets only stick together when faced in the right direction, and the train routinely breaks up if pulled too fast or constructed of too many letters. I suspect that it also helped him learn his colors, which we had struggled with for a while. And, of course, he loves it.\n\nBut there are several problems with the choo-choo train. The first is that, like all problem solving toys for toddlers, it has the tendency to frustrate him when such problems arise. In addition to the issues I already mentioned, he also hates it when the letters fall over. So, the choo-choo train brings with it the occasional cry of exasperation or outright sobbing when he gets too overcome by emotion to solve the problem immediately. Although he has the vocabulary for the solutions down by now (“fall over!”, “fix!”, “turn around!,” “stick!”), he can’t always make it work. Nor is it the case that me playing choo-choo train with him alleviates these unhappinesses, for the malfunctions with his personal train are no less frequent, and his frustration is equal in such situations, even with me sitting next to him.\n\nThe choo-choo train works for independent play for a shorter amount of time than many of his other toys, and once I’ve sat down to play with it next to him, I can’t get back up again unless some other major activity comes after the choo-choo train, which in this case would be feeding him his lunch. Any attempts to move on without such an event elicits a roaring succession of “Sit down, Dada!”, “Dada do it!”, and “Dada, help!”, to which there is no end.\n\nThe choo-choo train is out for now though. While we play, I throw on Rakim’s album Follow the Leader in the background since I’m re-evaluating it to make sure I still believe in my claim that Rakim is the greatest rapper of all time. However, I am quickly reminded, as I have been three days in a row now, that there is no way to hear Rakim’s complex lyricism while a toddler shouts “Cat train! Meow! Dada do it!”, so I switch to Tool’s Aenima, which I am also re-evaluating, though with lower stakes.\n\n12:30-1:00 pm: Lunchtime for Miles, which today means leftover fried rice that my wife made from scratch earlier in the week. He assists me in cleaning up the choo-choo train first though.\n\nMiles likes most of his lunch’s ingredients, although his famous distaste for green beans has not waned. While he eats, I clean his bottles and prepare one for his naptime. I also flip to the next page of The History of Photography, and examine the photograph on it. I keep a book on the visual arts in the kitchen, and I look at a new page each day as part of my new “getting into the visual arts” initiative. After three books of paintings and one of sculptures, I have moved on to photography. Today’s photograph is The Two Ways of Life by Oscar Rejlander, which is apparently a giant collage of different pictures that he made in 1857. It’s pretty cool for a giant collage from 1857.\n\nI pour myself a tumbler’s worth of water, to be consumed later when it isn’t so cold, and set up our bedroom for his nap, which entails laying out his Zipadee-Zip and turning on the fan. As I heat up his naptime bottle, I check in to make sure he’s eating his rice. This hasn’t been a controversial food, so it doesn’t require constant observation, but he’s been doing this new thing where, when he’s full towards the end of the meal, he simply picks up the remaining food on his high chair and throws it on the ground. We do not like that, so, as his meal winds down, I keep a close eye on him for telltale signs that he’s almost done. Today, we have no problems since he likes the rice, and I don’t feel compelled to force him to eat the green beans, as the meal already contains two other vegetables (carrots and peas).\n\nHe’s done with the rice. He’s eaten almost all of it, but not quite. It was the end of the rice though, which meant it was a serving too large for him to eat all of it. Satisfied, I dump the rest and clean off his face, using a round of the alphabet song to mitigate his displeasure at having his face washed. Knowing that he’s about to go down for a nap, my wife takes a moment from work to come out and say hey. He gives her much love, and then she goes back to work.\n\n1:00-1:30 pm: We go into the room, where I put him in his Zipadee-Zip and attempt to give him a kiss. He pushes me away, then, when I pretend not to care anymore, he grabs my face and forces multiple kisses on me. This is a daily, pre-nap game. I give him his bottle and rock him to sleep. As usual, the midday rocking is uneventful, and he goes down right away.\n\n1:30-3:00 pm: While Miles naps, I read. I start with the manuscript that I’m freelance editing, the one I did manual entry for earlier in the day. After I read 10 pages of that (only 40 left to go!), I finish James Baldwin’s Notes from a Native Son, which I only had a few pages left of. It’s fine, but when I blindly checked it out from the local library, I thought it was a novel and not a collection of essays, so it wasn’t what I wanted. I pick up the copy of Collected Poems by Dylan Thomas that I also blindly checked out from the local library and read 20 pages. That’s about as much Thomas as I can do at once, so I take a break to check social media. People are mean on Twitter but less so on Facebook and not at all on Instagram. Dylan Thomas would probably have had all three.\n\nI go back to reading, this time Mary Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Women. She keeps quoting Paradise Lost as if people in the seventeenth century took it as a legit guide to moral behavior, making me wonder how its reductive conception of womanhood affected female poets from his era. This leads me to revisit Lady Mary Wroth, the only female poet from the seventeenth century whose poetry I’ve ever enjoyed, although she preceded Milton. We don’t own a separate book of hers, but we have multiple anthologies with her in them, so I reread a few poems, which are about as good as I remember. Remembering that I saw an anthology of seventeenth century women’s poetry at a local bookstore and thought “Are there really enough good seventeenth century female poets for an anthology?”, I decide to give some of them another chance, even though I actually did just that a couple of months ago under different circumstances. I open up our anthology of seventeenth century poetry, and read randomly selected poems.\n\nEh. I feel the same as I did before. Oh well.\n\nI debate whether to read more Thomas since I know I’ll read Wollstonecraft tonight when Miles goes to bed, but I’m not really up for it. I’ve been thinking about his influence on Plath the entire time I’ve been reading him, so I open The Collected Poems of Sylvia Plath to around the middle of her career and read a couple of poems to compare her to Thomas. I feel vindicated in my original assessment of Plath as a direct follower of Thomas who had better control of her content, exercising a self-restraint that, although it makes her earlier poetry a little thin, allowed her to rise above Thomas as she matured. Thomas has a great ear, and some of his poems are fantastic, but, despite his elaborate and deft use of form, he manages to simultaneously lack the self-discipline necessary to consistently produce great poetry. As a friend of mine put it, Thomas sometimes gets carried away with how a poem sounds and loses his grip on the work itself.\n\nThis method of reading, where I jump from poet to poet at will, is only possible because I’m not actively reading a novel and so I have open space in my reading schedule. Otherwise, I feel guilty hopping around like this, choosing poems at random and assessing them quickly. Of course, I still do it all the time anyway. But I usually feel guilty.\n\n3:00-3:40 pm: Miles wakes up from his nap. Another daily routine occurs in which I call him a Toblerone and ask him how he feels about me, to which he initially replies “Blegh!” and then, at my feigned shock, changes it to “Yay, Dada!” I take him out of his Zipadee-Zip, and we head back into the nursery. It’s unclear how long it will be until my wife gets off of work, so the choo-choo train is not in play at the moment.\n\nWe run around in a circle, shouting “Christmas party! Madman! Miles time! Christmas party!” That’s about five minutes right there.\n\nMiles is feeling good after the Christmas party and wants to read. I’m trying to get him to read the Walt Whitman board book we have so that I can get credit for it on Goodreads, but he wants to read the board book version of The Hound of the Baskervilles for the thirtieth time this week. We get halfway through before we arrive at the page that has a clock on it, and that’s the end of his interest in me reading with him, as he dives off of my lap onto the floor, his face literally an inch from the page.\n\nI decide to play basketball with the back-of-the-door hoop and weird green ball that I’ve been using since I started being a stay-at-home parent. It’s mid-season, and my team is the second overall seed in the league, but we’re looking to make a push for the number one spot. My teammates let me down in the Finals last season, and we got off to a rocky start at the beginning of the year, but we’re firing on all cylinders heading toward the All-Star Break, and we’re eyeing our seventh win in a row. The team we’re playing is undersized, and I take advantage early on the low block with a dizzying series of skyhooks, Dream shakes, and fadeaways, leaving their helpless center shell-shocked. They smartly double-team me, so I kick it out to my open teammates, but they start to blow easy shots, and the other team takes advantage on fast breaks, going on a quick 13-2 run. I call a timeout from the floor. In the huddle, we revise our strategy, and, knowing that the team is expecting me to continue playing in the paint, I catch them off guard with two quick threes. At this point, I’m shooting 6/15, with four threes and a couple of free throws. A good individual game for me, but we’re down by seven, so I’m not pleased. I take it hard to the hoop, get blocked, but muscle in for the rebound anyway and get fouled laying it in. As I start my free-throw shooting motion, my wife comes in.\n\nAnd that’s it. That’s what a day looks like in my world."
