        "text": "Commentary for the September 7, 2019 Sabbath School Lesson\n\n\"When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.\" \"Matthew 9:36, NIV\n\nAs I write this commentary, the news is filled with tales of disaster. Dorian, a category 5 hurricane, is swirling over the Bahamas taking lives and destroying personal property and infrastructure. Every few days, someone seems to go berserk and simply begin killing people. In the United States, they are called mass shootings because the weapon of choice is often a rifle designed to inflict as much death and destruction as is legally possible. But even when such weapons are not available, those with murderous intent seem to be only minimally inconvenienced as crowded conditions in many of our cities put numerous victims within easy reach of even knife-wielding murderers as was recently seen in a subway station near Lyon, France. If this were not enough to produce anxiety in the hearts of people, large swaths of the Amazon rain forest are being put to the torch in a direct challenge to the claim of many climatologists that the Amazon jungle is essential for maintaining a healthy environment on this little blue marble spinning through space. Sometimes we can feel like the proverbial Dutch boy with his finger in the dike trying to prevent the deluge. But as problems multiply, we are running out of fingers. Nonetheless, too few seem inclined to step forward to provide the extra fingers needed to defuse impending disaster.\n\nA very few wealthy individuals seem intent on ravaging the earth for plunder and profit to add to already obscene levels of wealth. They do this far beyond any reasonable need, at the expense of those struggling to maintain a handhold while chaos swirls around them. Wars, famines and the greed of the wealthy drive them from their homes, leaving them without secure food, water, shelter or medical assistance. Too often, they are stigmatized as the enemy by those who hold the reins of power tightly in their clenched fists. Driven to despair by the lack of compassion and justice they have experienced and for lack of any other options, they may respond with violence to the violence and oppression they have felt for years. However, violence feeds on violence and the cycle, which may have had clear issues at the beginning, perpetuates itself until no one really remembers what started it all. They only know that the other is the enemy and survival somehow depends on destroying that foe. So much blood now waters the ground; the earth itself must weep and stagger with the impact of so much unrelenting evil.\n\nWhat is to be done? Where can we find the answer? We are inundated with those who claim to know. The National Rifle Association, perhaps influenced by the weapons manufacturers, claims that more guns are the answer. Movies and television back that up. Keanu Reeves as John Wick and Liam Neeson in the \"Taken\" series are among many who assure us that guns and violence are the only possible answers for dealing with an enemy. Violent actors like Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone have become stereotypes of the proverbial \"good guy with a gun\" that will save us all. Such heroic stories are nothing new. Even the Bible offers justice at the point of a sword, or from stones in a sling in the case of David versus Goliath. What is perhaps unique to our time is that people are abandoning any other possible option in droves as weapons sales soar and individuals stock pile guns, ammunition and supplies as they fear so many weapons in the hands of everyone else could cause society to explode into an apocalyptic, post civilization, every-man-for-himself scenario. Once again the entertainment industry has fed those fears and capitalized on them with movies like \"The Road\" and series like \"The Walking Dead.\" Perhaps it should be no surprise that many then feel \"harassed and helpless\" like puppets on tethers that someone, somewhere, is constantly pulling to shift society into darkness when it would normally seek light.\n\nAlthough evil was not as technologically refined as it is today, two millennia ago, many struggled with survival. Right up until the 20th century many children did not survive long after birth, due to inadequate sanitation, nutrition, and other basic needs not being fulfilled. We now have a minimal social safety net, but that safety net is constantly under assault as the wealthy have waged an unceasing battle to convince society that tolerating the poor is what destroys happiness for everyone. The wealthy are like the friend who takes nine of our ten cookies for himself while convincing us that the real enemy is the poor person who might come and take our remaining cookie. When we point out to the wealthy man that he has taken almost all of the cookies himself, he nonchalantly assures us that he did so in our best interest and that doing so will assure us of eventual prosperity just like his. In the meantime, naive and gullible, we do his bidding and vilify the poor, depriving them of even minimal essentials, believing that someday that ghost ship of prosperity will sail into our port with its phantasmal wealth. As a result we have created a society where most beat down but never beat up. We oppress those who we feel are below us, the poor and the powerless, while providing those above us with our service as the loyal sycophants they so desperately need. The only thing that might bring such a system crashing down is if the wealthy become so greedy they no longer are willing to provide even token rewards to those who stand in the gap between them and the abject poor. With a global population now over seven and a half billion and a finite number of resources being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, that scenario may not be so difficult to envision as it once was. I fear what could happen should that day ever arise for a society that has glorified guns and violence as this one has.\n\nAll of this would be a depressing outcome much like the movies portray with their dark, post-apocalyptic societies if the earth were an isolated biosphere, alone in the ether. But two thousand years ago, in Bethlehem, we were reminded that this is not the case. Our blue globe is only a very tiny, minuscule planet, morally adrift in the vast panoply of the universe. I cannot help but feel that as our planet, with its taint of darkness, chugs through the universe, we appear to the rest like a diesel truck \"rolling coal\" through the neighborhood where everyone has just hung their clean white sheets out to dry after washing the linens. Whether intentionally or not, we have certainly drawn the attention of the universe, and an ephemeral God[i] incarnated to intervene. He didn't just drop by for a brief visit. He experienced childhood and the prime of adulthood which likely allowed him to clearly see what we are all dealing with.[ii] As a result, he saw the many errors we were laboring under. He desired to open our eyes both literally and metaphorically. All the darkness we are being constantly fed obscures that there is light also. He tried to show us that there is greater power in light than in darkness. The smallest, tiniest light is adequate to penetrate the deepest darkness. He urged us to once again make light the focus of our lives as we were once created to do.[iii] This not only enlightens us. It allows others to see through our example that there is not only darkness in the world. There is light.\n\nA natural thing happens when we are in a dark place, and we see a light. We move toward it. Once Jesus brought light into our world, we were drawn to him.[iv] Then as we took in his light, we became beacons drawing others to the light. But evil is of the darkness, literally and metaphorically. Criminals love the cover of darkness to commit their crimes and darkness is a metaphor for hidden agendas and opaqueness. Whether individuals or institutions, those who practice such things are of darkness no matter how much they may protest otherwise. Those, who because of their criminality and greed could not allow light to illuminate their true intent, pursued Jesus relentlessly, finally putting him to death. They thought that would extinguish the light that was exposing their evil intent. But they failed to see the bigger picture. Earth is not a universe unto itself. It is only a bit player that is stumbling to remember even that small part. Caught up in its own corporeal perspective, the power players with their hidden agendas could not understand that they do not have the tools to kill, much less control, the Spirit of God. Not only did they fail to extinguish the light, they established the uniqueness of its source through the events surrounding Christ's death and resurrection.\n\nThe importance of all of this is to achieve understanding that guns, violence and more darkness are not the answer to the illness that afflicts our planet. As Jesus demonstrated repeatedly, compassion and justice are what is required. Healing the sick, feeding the hungry, carrying one another's burdens, and justice tempered with mercy are the ways that light enters into the darkness and dispels it. If we receive the light of God's Spirit into our lives, we will begin to do those very things, and by our example, others will come to the light as well, and they, in turn, will do the same. Darkness will oppose the light, for that is its nature, but it cannot overcome it, no matter how vicious and nasty it may try to make itself appear. The power remains with the light.\n\n[i] John 4:24\n\n[ii] Hebrews 4:15\n\n[iii] Matthew 5:14-16\n\n[iv] John 1:4-5\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, you might also enjoy this book written by the author, currently on sale..\n\nTo learn more click on this link.\n\nCreation: Myth or Majesty\n\nThis Commentary is a Service of Still Waters Ministry\n\nwww.visitstillwaters.com\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @digitalpreacher\n\nIf you wish to receive these weekly commentaries direct to your e-mail inbox for free, simply send an e-mail to:\n\ncommentaries-subscribe@visitstillwaters.com\n\nScripture marked (NIV) taken from the Holy Bible, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION®.
