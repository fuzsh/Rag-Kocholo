        "text": "Josh Chatraw: The Apologetics of Blaise Pascal + “Superstition” (Stevie Wonder)\n\nFaith happens, and this week’s episode of Three Chords and the Truth: The Apologetics Podcast is all about how faith happens. In the first half, Garrick and Timothy are joined by Josh Chatraw, the apologist extraordinaire who has been freshly forgiven for his many missteps when it comes to being conversant in the art of […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nSean McDowell: Getting the Gospel to Generation Z + “Baba O’Riley” (The Who)\n\n“Generation Z.” “iGen.” “Centennials.” Whatever you happen to call this generation, the children who drew their first breaths in the years between Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic” and Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” are the first generation of digital natives in human history. But how secure is the faith of these teenagers and young adults? And how […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nApologetics: Were the Stories of Jesus Based on Pagan Parallels?\n\nPagan parallels to Christianity! Is it possible, as some people claim, that the stories of Jesus were based on Pagan myths? It’s an accusation that’s been around a long time. Even in ancient times, critics of Christianity noticed some parallels between Christian beliefs and pre-Christian myths. In the late second century, a philosopher named Celsus charged, “The […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nApologetics: Final Examination for Fall 2020 On-Campus Christian Apologetics Courses\n\nIt’s that time again! Below, you will find the final examination for my on-campus courses in Christian Apologetics this semester at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Students: Once you open the file, you must complete the examination in its entirety. There is no time limit, but the only resources you may use are your own […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nJosh Chatraw and Stephen Presley: How to Do Apologetics Like the Early Church\n\nIt’s a two-for-the-price-of-one sale this week at Three Chords and the Truth: The Apologetics Podcast! (Actually, it’s “two-for-the-price-of-none,” since you don’t actually have to pay to listen to the podcast anyway.) In any case, the focus is apologetics in the early church. The festivities begin with church historian extraordinaire Stephen Presley, who joins us to talk […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nAlisa Childers: The False Gospel of Progressive Christianity + “I Want to Know What Love Is” (Foreigner)\n\nWelcome to the first-ever—and probably the only-ever—episode of Three Chords and the Truth: The Apologetics Podcast that’s focused on love. And so, pull up a chair, strap on your headphones, grab your favorite scissors and your red construction paper, and prepare to cut out some paper hearts. (And, by the way, why hasn’t anyone ever […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nRussell Moore: The Search for a Satisfying Story + “He Went to Paris” (Jimmy Buffett)\n\nSometimes, the best defense of the gospel isn’t a better argument but a better story. That’s why the previous episode about Josh Chatraw’s book Telling a Better Story and this episode with Russell Moore both focus on narrative apologetics. Also: after an episode in which your intrepid cohosts dredged the depths of some of the […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nApologetics: How Much Intellectual Common Ground Is There Between a Christian and a Non-Christian? Common Notions and Common Ground in the Writings of Cornelius Van Til\n\nThe thinking of a Christian and a non-Christian diverges at the most basic level. The believer in Jesus Christ sees all of reality from the cognitive perspective of an individual who lives with “the mind of Christ” and whose life is shaped by the Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:16). This does not cause Christians […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nTimothy Paul Jones and Garrick Bailey: How to Do Apologetics in a Skeptical Age\n\nHave you ever heard terms like “presuppositionalism,” “evidentialism,” or “classical apologetics”? Have you wondered if there’s an easier way to understand apologetics? Maybe you’ve even wished that people could defend the Christian faith in a skeptical age without talking about these terms at all. If so, this episode is for you! (Actually, every episode is […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nTed Cabal: Creation and the Age of the Earth + “Let There Be Rock” (AC/DC)\n\nThis episode is packed with answers in Genesis—but, believe it or not, when we say “Genesis” we’re not talking about the group that’s been fronted by Phil Collins since the early 1970s from which Mike + the Mechanics was a spinoff. The focus of this week’s episode is the other Genesis, the one at the […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nLisa V. Fields: Apologetics through Eyes of Color + “Crossroads” (Robert Johnson)\n\nThe blues, Robert Johnson, and The Jackson 5 are a few of the stars of this week’s episode of Three Chords and the Truth: The Apologetics Podcast. Lisa V. Fields—popular apologetics speaker and founder of the Jude 3 Project—joins Timothy to discuss a recent apologetics curriculum from Jude 3 Project. Along the way, Lisa reveals […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nApologetics: Final Examination for Summer Apologetics Courses\n\nThis is the examination that students in my live summer apologetics courses at Boyce College and at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary will be taking this week. If you’re interested in what they’re learning, take a look and see how you might answer these questions! Click here to download the final examination: 28700 Christian Apologetics […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nApologetics: Who Wrote the Gospels?\n\nOpen your Bible to the table of contents and take a look at the list of books in the New Testament. There, you’ll find the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John leading the list. But were Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John really the ones who wrote the Gospels? If so, how do we […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nVocab Malone: Speaking Truth to Hebrew Israelites + “One Vision” (Queen)\n\nYour intrepid cohosts have been watching lots of films with their families during this season of social distancing, so it’s not surprising that so many movies make appearances in this week’s episode. The first film that shows up is the 2016 Netflix film Barry, a fictional look at what Barack Obama’s first year at Columbia […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nJ.V. Fesko: Reforming Apologetics + “Freewill” (Rush)\n\nWelcome to the Deeper-Than-Usual Episode! This episode has been named “the Deeper-Than-Usual Episode” mostly because it is a bit deeper than usual. Dr. J.V. Fesko—professor of systematic and historical theology at Reformed Theological Seminary, author of Reforming Apologetics, and all-around very deep person—joins the dynamic duo to discuss many deep things. Dr. Fesko momentarily risks his […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nMatthew Levering: Why Reason and the Physical Resurrection of Jesus Matter + “Stairway to Heaven” (Led Zeppelin)\n\nReason, resurrection, and the physical world are the focus of the most action-packed episode of Three Chords and the Truth ever produced. The primary reason why it’s so action packed is because the Toybox Hero Tournament includes a special cohost who is far more exciting than either of your intrepid cohosts. Renowned theologian Dr. Matthew Levering […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nRobert Plummer: Do the Gospels Tell the Truth? + “Truth, Goodness, and Beauty” (The Cure)\n\nWhat does it mean to say that the Bible tells the truth? Do the Gospels tell the truth? And what should Christians do when they find a claim in the Bible that looks like a contradiction? Do the Gospels Tell the Truth? New Testament scholar and Daily Dose of Greek mastermind Rob Plummer joins Garrick […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nJ. Warner Wallace: A Cold-Case Detective Looks at the Gospels + “Another Brick in the Wall” (Pink Floyd)\n\nWhat happens when a cold-case detective applies his investigative skills to the New Testament Gospels? Find out as Timothy meets up with award-winning detective and bestselling apologetics author J. Warner Wallace. In addition to being a detective and apologist, Wallace is also a guitarist, bassist, and—Timothy is thrilled beyond words to discover—a fan of Steve […]\n\n[Read More...]\n\nJosh Chatraw: Apologetics at the Cross + “Word on a Wing” (David Bowie)\n\nApologetics scholar Josh Chatraw joins Garrick and Timothy to talk about cross-centered apologetics, Augustine of Hippo, and what it takes to hang out with Tim Keller. Josh is the coauthor of several books, including Truth in a Culture of Doubt from B&H Academic and Apologetics at the Cross. Along the way, Josh makes the mistake […]\n\n[Read More...]"
