        "text": "Growing up, watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off in my house was a sacred ritual.\n\nI remember the first time I watched it. I recorded it from HBO and my family watched that VHS tape so much that it probably wore out from so many views. At one point in my life, I could, if asked, recite the lines of any given character in that movie.\n\nTo say that I am a fan of the John Hughes-directed movie would be an understatement. Ferris is a cult following, and the Rocks are proud members. I'm even watching Matthew Broderick's new series Painkiller, which is anything but funny, just because he's in it. Ferris is exactly the kind of film that connects with the nostalgia fanatics who attend Rhode Island Comic Con.\n\nI'm sure organizers feel the same way, which is probably why they decided to book Jeffrey Jones, the guy you love to hate in the movie. Jones plays the dim-witted school principal who gets outsmarted by Ferris at every turn. As The New York Times review of the film notes, Ferris is the Road Runner and Ed Rooney is the coyote.\n\nThe only problem was the man who played Edward R. Rooney, Dean of Students, also appears on California's national sex offender database after pleading guilty to paying a 14-year-old boy to pose nude in photos.\n\nJones was booked for Rhode Island Comic Con months ago. Organizers say that one of their vendors requested to bring Jones to the event and they agreed. After getting complaints from the public about the booking, organizers discovered his disgraceful past and canceled his appearance.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rhode Island Comic Con accidentally posted another photo promoting his appearance."
