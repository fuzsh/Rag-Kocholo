        "text": "Celebrity pro wrestler Hulk Hogan took a dive in Florida, and it was OK with him.\n\nHogan was baptized at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo.\n\nHe then helped baptize his wife, Sky, and posted the experiences on Instagram Wednesday, Dec. 20. Here's what he had to say:\n\nHulk Hogan baptized in Florida church\n\n\"Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment… only love!\"\n\nAfter being baptized, Hogan helped baptize his third wife, Sky Daily Hogan. Both were wearing white, with Hogan also wearing a white bandana and silver cross.\n\nWhere is Indian Rocks Baptist Church?\n\nIndian Rocks Baptist Church is located at 12685 Ulmerton Road in Largo, south of Clearwater, on Florida's west coast.\n\nHulk Hogan accept Christ as his savior as a teenager\n\nIn April, tweeted he had accepted Jesus Christ as his savior when he was a teenager.\n\n\"I accepted Christ as my savior at 14yrs old, and the training, prayers and vitamins kept me in the game but now that I am one with God, the main event theme of surrender, service and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Savior and so it is, even now brother, AMEN!\"\n\nAccording to the Christian Post, in a 2013 interview with Oprah, Hogan said, \"I realized all that stuff — the peace, love, the joy, that still, small voice, the energy, that God presence — is part of who I'm meant to be.\"\n\nWho is Hulk Hogan?\n\nHogan was born Terry Gene Bollea in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953.\n\nHulk Hogan, 70, is one of the greatest — certainly one of the most attention-getting — professional wrestlers of all time. He has lived in Florida since his days as a reality star on \"Hogan Knows Best.\"\n\nHe's lived in Tampa and Miami, got married and then divorced and then married again. He now resides in Clearwater, where he opened a Hulkamania shop. A second shop is located in Orlando.\n\nWhat does baptism mean?\n\n\"If the meaning of baptism could be summarized in one word, that would be identification. Baptism speaks primarily of personal, public identification with Jesus Christ,\" according to Christianity.com.\n\n\"When we enter the waters of baptism, we proclaim the gospel message. Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and lives again. By joining in baptism, we’re identifying ourselves with Him.\""
