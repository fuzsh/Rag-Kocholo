        "text": "Brooke Hogan is speaking out for the first time since her dad, Hulk Hogan, caused a firestorm by bringing up O.J. Simpson in relation to his divorce proceedings with estranged wife Linda.\n\nLast month, Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, was quoted in Rolling Stone magazine, saying, “I could have turned everything into a crime scene, like O.J., cutting everybody’s throat,” he said. “You live half a mile from the 20,000-square-foot home you can’t go to anymore, you’re driving through downtown Clearwater and see a 19-year-old boy driving your Escalade, and you know that a 19-year-old boy is sleeping in your bed, with your wife… I totally understand O.J. I get it.”\n\nThe quote prompted a wave of headlines and an angry response from Linda, but daughter Brooke Hogan said her father’s quote was taken out of context.\n\n“I was actually in the kitchen with him and the Rolling Stone guy when my dad was doing the interview. I was making veggie rolls or something for him when he said it. I’ll tell you exactly how he said it — he was like, ‘Dude, I understand, you could flip out. It makes you that mad. You could flip out like that.’”\n\nHogan added that her father would never commit a crime like the one he referred to in Rolling Stone.\n\n“Thank god my dad, you know, is walking in the light of Christ and is a Christian man, and he would never do something like that, ever,” Hogan insisted.\n\nBut Hogan said she warned her dad the quote was going to be used.\n\n“I think I told him. I said, ‘Watch them print that,’” she said.\n\nWhile Hogan insists her father would never hurt a family member, Hulk’s estranged wife Linda Hogan claims she is afraid of her husband, as she told Access on Monday at another hearing related to their divorce.\n\n“I’m afraid for my life, you know, it’s all too similar to the O.J. situation,” she said.\n\nAnd Brooke Hogan confirmed that her mother said a similar statement during one of their conversations.\n\n“She did, but I start to wonder if she said that to me to sway me, or if she says that to me because she really means it, you know?” Hogan asked. “She’s said it in the past, but I’m just trying to figure out the personality type going on there.”\n\nCautious about trusting her mother since Linda Hogan began dating a then 19-year-old, Brooke says she has sided with her father because of accountability.\n\n“He’s okay with saying he was wrong, and wanting to fix it,” Hogan said. “I just keep begging my mom, ‘Please be honest with me. Tell me who you are.’”\n\nOn Monday, the divorcing parties squared off in court. Hulk had his new girlfriend seated behind him and outside, Linda addressed her year-long relationship.\n\n“I did not know how young he was when I met him,” Linda Hogan said. “(We) had a very good relationship, and we ended up falling in love.”\n\nBut Brooke Hogan, 21, doesn’t understand where her mother is coming from and addresses their strife in her new song, “Dear Mom,” off her upcoming CD, “The Redemption.” The song includes lines about her mother smoking and hanging out with her new love.\n\n“I’ve heard different things that she’s been doing,” Hogan said of what inspired the tune. “I had no idea that she smoked cigarettes. That was one thing that kind of… You can take that lyric any way you want.”\n\nSome might take that lyric to fuel rumors that Linda has been smoking more than cigarettes.\n\nLinda Hogan denies drug use.\n\nWhen asked if she thinks her mother will ever come clean to her, Brooke suggested she has hope the two can repair their relationship.\n\n“I don’t even know if she has anything to come clean about. I mean, I’m listening to my gut and I think she does, but I just want her to keep her priorities straight,” Hogan said. “If it was me, I would put my daughter and son first.”\n\nIn a statement to Access, a rep for Linda Hogan said the mother and daughter haven’t seen each other in a while.\n\n“Unfortunately it has been seven months since Linda has seen her baby girl. All Brooke knows is what her father tells her. It’s sad when people involve children in a divorce,” the rep’s statement read. “She loves her daughter. Linda is actively not only working through the paper intense divorce finding the rest of Hulk’s hidden assets, but also working with her favorite charity Pink Paws For Life.”"
