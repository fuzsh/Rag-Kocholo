In other words, it’s a good one. Live from Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington (go Seahawks!), it’s Wrestlemania 19 – School of Brock! Magical movie music played in the openingContinue reading “Wrestlemania 19”\n\nWrestlemania 18\n\nAs you probably are aware, between Wrestlemania 17 and 18, the Invasion angle happened. Some say the Invasion angle should have been extended to Wrestlemania 18 due to more high profile WCW stars like Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Ric Flair now being part of the WWF roster. So to see what thisContinue reading “Wrestlemania 18”\n\nWrestlemania 9\n\nI know what you’re probably thinking. Wrestlemania 9 sucks, right? Although many consider this to be the worst Wrestlemania of all time, I can’t say that I agree for reasons I will explain later. I really like the outdoor arena for some reason. It was one of my favourites to play on WWE 2K14. AsContinue reading “Wrestlemania 9”\n\nWrestlemania 8\n\nGet ready for the most limousine riding, jet flying, kiss stealing, wheeler dealing, granddaddy of them all. WOO! Yeah, Ric Flair’s on this PPV. Live from the Hoosier Dome (Goodbye Mr A) in Indianapolis, Indiana, it’s Wrestlemania 8: When Nature Boy Calls! For the first time since the original Wrestlemania, the national anthem was sungContinue reading “Wrestlemania 8”\n\nRoyal Rumble 1992\n\nWITH A TEAR IN MY EYE! I’ve decided to do something a bit different for this special episode covering one of the most renowned Royal Rumbles in history. So instead of my normal ramblings in written form, I’ve made a podcast instead, giving you my thoughts in audio. Have a listen in the player aboveContinue reading “Royal Rumble 1992”\n\nSurvivor Series 1991\n\nTime for a show that’s basically an advert for ‘This Tuesday in Texas’. Live from the Joe Louis Arena in the Motor City, Detroit, Michigan, it’s Survivor Series 1991! The show kicked off with a recap of WWF Superstars. Jake Roberts turned up with a Cobra which bit Randy Savage on the arm. THAT SNAKEContinue reading “Survivor Series 1991”\n\nSummerslam 1991\n\nI’m posting this on May 19th 2018. Along with being Kane’s least favourite day of the year, it’s also the date where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting married. So to celebrate this Royal Wedding, I am covering a sort of Royal Wedding of my own. It’s Summerslam 1991 featuring the First Lady ofContinue reading “Summerslam 1991”\n\nWrestlemania 7\n\nWhen you think back to Wrestlemania 7, you might think about how it couldn’t sell out the LA Coliseum. You might look down on the controversial storyline and subsequent main event of this PPV. But after I went out and watched Wrestlemania 7, I was shocked by how good it really was. Live from theContinue reading “Wrestlemania 7”\n\nRoyal Rumble 1991\n\nUSA! USA! USA! *blows raspberry* Live from the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida in the “Greatest Country in the World” the United States of America, it’s Royal Rumble 1991! The US National Anthem opened the show because Sgt. Slaughter is an evil man so we must counteract this evilness by being more patriotic. A U-S-AContinue reading “Royal Rumble 1991”"
