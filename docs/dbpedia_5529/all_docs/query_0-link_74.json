        "text": "(UPDATED: 4/4/2024)\n\nThis year (2022), I will not be covering WrestleMania live. Truthfully, I only did it in 2020 because it seemed like a good and easy way to grow the blog. In 2021, I did it more out of obligation than anything, and this year, I’ve realized I just don’t want to do it. Reviewing things live is not good for me. I’ve rewatched things I’ve not loved on those shows, and felt nowhere nearly as negatively as I did at the time. I think it forces me to become a prisoner of the moment somewhat, and given how much of this site’s work is based on the idea of rewatching things long after the fact, I don’t think it’s in anyone’s best interest to do that anymore.\n\n(As always, if you insist on me writing about something in the current year before the end of the year, you can simply pay me to do so.)\n\nStill, I wanted to do something here, since I didn’t plan on covering WrestleMania live going forward. I thought about just redoing the theme song list, as a few people have asked for in the past few years. I toyed a few years back about doing different lists, only to come up with them a little late to really do them full justice. Others have asked before for lists like of Mania main events, or other things like that. Is it fair to turn out something big and serious if you haven’t done the required research to really stand on those opinions? Unless this is the first thing you’re reading on this blog or are very very new to the party, I think you know that my answer is no.\n\nHowever, this is bullshit and I initially wrote this on April Fools, and that is that.\n\nAm I going to do this every year? Maybe I will update it. Did I want to do a slightly bigger thing this year than just re-doing an old fan favorite list article? Yes.\n\nIn a fun change from previous list series, as well as one that I think will prove beneficial to all of us in the long run, I will be offering as little explanation as possible outside of the lists that have nothing to do with the matches themselves.\n\nWRESTLEMANIA OPENERS, RANKED:\n\nBret Hart vs. Owen Hart, WrestleMania X (3/20/1994)\n\nDaniel Bryan vs. Triple H, WrestleMania XXX (4/6/2014)\n\nFinlay vs. JBL, WrestleMania XXIV (3/30/2008)\n\nThe Rockers vs. The Faces of Fear, WrestleMania VII (3/24/1991)\n\nEddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio, WrestleMania 21 (4/3/2005)\n\nCM Punk vs. Christian vs. Kane vs. Mark Henry vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP, WrestleMania 25 (4/5/2009)\n\nThe Shield vs. Randy Orton/Sheamus/The Big Show, WrestleMania NY/NJ (4/7/2013)\n\nCamp Cornette (Vader/Owen Hart/Davey Boy Smith) vs. Yokozuna/Ahmed Johnson/Jake Roberts, WrestleMania XII (3/31/1996)\n\nMatt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio, WrestleMania XIX (3/30/2003)\n\nThe Big Show vs. John Cena, WrestleMania XX (3/14/2004)\n\nRhea Ripley vs. Charlotte Flair, WrestleMania 36 Night Two (4/5/2020)\n\nRK-Bro vs. The Street Profits vs. Alpha Academy, WrestleMania 38 Night Two (4/3/2022)\n\nKevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. The Miz vs. Zack Ryder vs. Sin Cara II vs. Stardust, WrestleMania 32 (4/3/2016)\n\nDaniel Bryan vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Luke Harper vs. Bad News Barrett vs. R-Truth vs. Stardust, WrestleMania 31 (3/29/2015)\n\nRandy Orton vs. Edge vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Booker T vs. Finlay vs. CM Punk vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy, WrestleMania 23 (4/1/2007)\n\nEdge vs. Alberto Del Rio, WrestleMania XXVII (4/3/2011)\n\nChris Jericho vs. William Regal, WrestleMania X7 (4/1/2001)\n\nShawn Michaels vs. Tito Santana, WrestleMania VIII (4/5/1992)\n\nWilliam Regal vs. Rob Van Dam, WrestleMania X8 (3/17/2002)\n\nThe Miz vs. Seth Rollins vs. Finn Balor, WrestleMania 34 (4/8/2018)\n\nBattle Royal, WrestleMania IV (3/27/1988)\n\nSheamus vs. Daniel Bryan, WrestleMania XXVIII (4/1/2012)\n\nBrock Lesnar vs. Seth Rollins, WrestleMania 35 (4/7/2019)\n\nBrock Lesnar vs. Omos, WrestleMania 39 Night Two (4/2/2023)\n\nBilly Gunn vs. Al Snow vs. Hardcore Holly, WrestleMania XV (3/28/1999)\n\nBobby Lashley vs. Drew McIntyre, WrestleMania 37 Night One (4/10/2021)\n\nThe Allied Powers (Lex Luger/Davey Boy Smith) vs. The Blu Brothers, WrestleMania XI (4/3/1995)\n\nRick Martel vs. Koko B.

WRESTLEMANIA 22 (4/2/2006) – It was good. The least of the shows I attended that weekend, but that’s on the fed for not booking Low Ki vs. Necro Butcher or giving Roderick Strong a live mic at like 12:30 am.\n\nWRESTLEMANIA SETS, RANKED:\n\n39. WRESTLEMANIA 36 – This is nobody’s fault. COVID shutdowns, a global pandemic, all that fun stuff. As the following WrestleMania’s set showed — given the same location and theme as this was supposed to have, likely not wanting to waste what was already built or being built — there was probably something better than this in store for the show. However, it took place in an empty warehouse and so, you know, shit sucked. Some screens and a small ramp, with a big sign in the background. It almost feels rude to include this, but they’re the ones who insisted on running the shows.\n\n38. WRESTLEMANIA 2 – The early ones here aren’t really sets. Just entrances. There are slowly innovations that make the others interesting in their own way, but WrestleMania 2 lacks any of that. They are just your classic 1980s aisle entrances. Not fancy, not offensive, not really anything.\n\n37. WRESTLEMANIA VII – Likewise, this could have been any show or arena in the world if you didn’t notice WrestleMania banners in the back and the special apron skirt. The only real difference is all the red, white, and blue iconography, but in a time of war, that’s just America in general sometimes. The only real difference between this and II are improvements that the WWF had made to their general presentation in the five years in between the two. It’s better looking because *the WWF* is better looking now, not because of any effort put into this one.\n\n36. WRESTLEMANIA VIII – The same deal as the previous year’s show. No real flourishes outside of what you’d get anywhere, with the only change being the WWF’s new neon light entrance that they debuted around this time. This has the slight edge over Mania VII as a result of a fancier normal set up, but also because it’s just a bigger venue and that’s a little bit more impressive.\n\n35/34/33. WRESTLEMANIAS XI, XII, & 13 – It’s the same mid 1990s WWF entrance tunnel, just with a different logo each time. Times are lean and whatever, and I still like the way this looks more then the previous times on this list that very little effort was put into differentiating things, but it’s probably not a coincidence that these coincide with the show not quite feeling as special as it could.\n\n32. WRESTLEMANIA VI – A lack of any real flourish in the entrances continues, but with the return of the famous WrestleMania III ring carts. Not as well used as they were originally, still a cool little detail that had a way of showing the scale of the event just like Mania 3.\n\n31. WRESTLEMANIA 32 – It’s nothing. Just a big god damned empty space. A big sign and a ramp, with the most spectacular part of the set up coming from the gigantic Jerry World screens themselves that the venue came with. A total absence of creativity, which is, I suppose, thematically appropriate if nothing else.\n\n30. WRESTLEMANIA 35 – Just a big video wall. I have no respect for something like this, it looks like the absolute bare minimum while still spending a whole lot of money.\n\n29. WRESTLEMANIA 25 – Five tall boy screens and a big star. Not bad, there’s at least a kind of idea, but there’s something soulless about this version of the bright and flashy display.\n\n28. WRESTLEMANIA 37 – It’s a pretty normal one. TV style video walls, normal otherwise, with the only real flourish being a gigantic pirate ship. At the same time, as far as flourishes go, a gigantic pirate ship is a pretty cool thing to have in your set.\n\n27. WRESTLEMANIA 38 – A significant improvement on 32’s Big Star concept, while also incorporating the giant WrestleMania sign idea. A little lifeless and empty, and maybe that changes with people there and maybe I went a little too early. But also, fuck it, and also fuck you a little bit.\n\n26. WRESTLEMANIA 2000 – It’s a few big video walls and metal truss works in between. Better than the dregs of the list, but the sort of thing that they’ll workshop and improve a lot more. The previous two sets at 14 & 15 showed a way forward, but as is befitting the show, this loses a lot of character trying to become bigger and flashier in a venue that isn’t really big enough for an idea like this to be fully fleshed out.\n\n25. WRESTLEMANIA NY/NJ – I don’t like this one. Something about it bugs me, there’s somehow both too much to it and also too little. Still, it’s better than the other MetLife set. I’ll always prefer excess in this category to nothingness (at least on purpose, a few sparser early sets are still to come), because at least they went for something.\n\n24. WRESTLEMANIA X8 – I can’t rightly say it’s not memorable, but not every memory is good. It’s what I picture mentally when I conjure up the idea of the late 90s/early 00s Giant Steel Monstrosity. The dial turned up not to 11, but to 11,000, a total monument to excess. Fitting for 2002, a year all about refusing to admit the Attitude Era was over and trying shortcut after shortcut to bring it back, as we see this maximalist hellscape. It’s cool when the set matches the point of the show, but sometimes that’s not always a good thing. More grandiose than those to follow, but I’ll always take charming minimalism over something as obnoxious as this.\n\n23. WRESTLEMANIA 39 – Huge and gaudy, but the theming helps a lot. The huge stairs and runway are a unique combo and the video wall corners also stand out a lot. One of the better modern maximalist designs.\n\n23. WRESTLEMANIA XIV – Another pretty normal one, just working with one of the steel truss sets that came into style in the late 1990s. There’s something I like a lot about Mania sets feeling like they match the wrestler who the show is designed around though, and there’s something simple and mean about this that feels right for Austin’s arrival.\n\n22. WRESTLEMANIA IV – The Atlantic City venue was smaller, but they made cool use of it for this and the next one with the narrow staircase entrances. The charm of the MSG entrances, but with something a little fancier and brighter.\n\n21. WRESTLEMANIA III – Again, there is no real flourish in the entrance area to speak of, but what we do have as a result of how big the Silverdome was are these cool little ring carts, as seen in Mania VI, but debuting here. They’re not unique, but the spotlight was used better, and the longer journey really emphasized the scale of the thing.\n\n20. WRESTLEMANIA X – A classic MSG set. No frills outside of spicing up the sliding door entrance just a little. That’ll be done a whole lot better at other pay-per-views in the 1990s and early 2000s held here, but it still retains some kind of timeless quality. A stately and classically sparse set up, befitting of the man that this WrestleMania revolved around.\n\n18. WRESTLEMANIA I – Fuck you. I don’t care. No real set or fancy activity here to speak of, but it is the old Madison Square Garden entrance, and that is particularly charming in its own way, with all the police around and fans up real close, put to especially good use in Roddy Piper’s main event entrance. The most like other wrestling that WrestleMania ever felt like, still a little dirty and unsantized, and it does real well with me as a result.\n\n17. WRESTLEMANIA 31 – Not awful, pretty good actually, but wildly overrated at the time, like the show itself outside of the main event. A more lifeless version of a set from a few years earlier, with more offputting lettering. Fitting for the location of the show itself (San Francisco), but not all that inspired. More famous for an all-time great hero shot photo at the end of the night, which was helped as much by fireworks and the open night sky than the design itself.\n\n16. WRESTLEMANIA V – Slight improvements on the WrestleMania IV entrance in the same venue. Better shots captured of the whole thing, slightly better set up. It’s the same place, but for whatever reason, it feels long a longer walk this time around, giving the main event a particularly grandiose feeling.\n\n15. WRESTLEMANIA XX – The debut of the really cool looking video floor. Combine it with a visually interesting series of video walls designed to replicate a city, used for real cool effect a few times, and it’s the sort of set that one remembers. One of these Mania sets that feels like the first try at an idea rather than one perfecting it, but a pretty cool one all the same.\n\n14. WRESTLEMANIA XV – I am definitely biased, this being the first WrestleMania I saw in real time, but it just looks like a big show set for the first time in a while now. One of the WWF’s great Steel Monstrosities of the Attitude Era. There are WrestleMania sets, entrances, and set-ups that have looked good before, but this feels like the first time they totally get what this can be.\n\n13. WRESTLEMANIA 23 – Not perfect, but there’s something about it I like. Real mid-century sort of vision of the future ass set. It is comically huge, but there’s something appealing about the whole thing. Another great fit, as this is a WrestleMania with a lot of big spectacle stuff, but like the set, it pretty much all works.\n\n12. WRESTLEMANIA 34 – Another great example of finding a theme and committing wholly. Big and a little overpowering, but one of these WrestleMania sets that succeeds through scale and ambition.\n\n11. WRESTLEMANIA XXX – A gigantic logo with video screens incorporated into the logo, and the return of the video floor/ramp. It’s not especially ambitious, but it does feel real big. Not one of the absolute best ones, unlike the show itself, but there’s something real likeable about it.\n\n10. WRESTLEMANIA 21 – A great use of theme. It’s the first try at utilizing a star on the set, but the red carpet is a great touch for the Hollywood theme. Beyond that, it’s a real simple and nice set. Big logo on the side, one large screen wall, and that’s it. Another WrestleMania set that comes close to that perfect combination of style and function.\n\n9. WRESTLEMANIA XXVII – One of the big ones that actually works. It’s not just a hundred video screens, which helps. the gigantic lettering is new, the dome structure is different, and the gigantic shiny/reflective stage is real gorgeous. The late 2000s/early 2010s sets are very much these displays of pure budget, but none of them looked quite as pretty as this one. The gigantic cube above the ring also rocked.\n\n8. WRESTLEMANIA 22 – Admittedly, I am biased. It’s the only one I’ve ever seen in person. But there’s something really simple and beautiful about it. Big simple video towers, one in the middle, and then the unique touch of having these blown up pictures of the major stars hanging from the rafters. Like WrestleMania X7’s set or others still to come, it’s an example of what I think this is supposed to look and feel like. A spectacle, but not overpoweringly so, and with some simplicity still left to it.\n\n7. WRESTLEMANIA XXVIII – It’s simple. It’s just a longer version of the WWE TV video wall, with gigantic lattering above it, in a big wide open air stadium, with palm trees around the ring. There’s no real intricate lighting rig, no video or reflective floor, none of that. It’s the simplest WrestleMania set in in five or six years, at least relatively. I just love it. There’s something about it that looks really really great in the background of things like the famous John Cena post-main event picture, or other matches. It feels like a conscious attempt, on a show with such a huge main event, to simply allow for the atmosphere to do the trick, and I love that.\n\n6. WRESTLEMANIA XXVI – If you are going to do something, really do it. Whole ass an entire thing, commit with the entirety of your body, mind, and spirit. If you are going to create a monument to your pocketbook and to your vision, a temple of opulence, why not remove the subtext entirely? This thing, the pyramid of video walls, the pyramid rig holding the screens up above the ring, it’s all breathtaking. WrestleMania 27’s is prettier, but I just love something about this. I prefer it when there’s a combination of both style and substance, but something this massive and extravagant is sometimes just too hard to deny.\n\n5. WRESTLEMANIA X7 – Another big step forward for the company in this regard. A successful retooling of the previous year’s attempt to introduce big screens and something flashier, but with a really simple look. Maybe not the absolute best version of this, but there’s something classical about it in its own way. Like the show itself, it feels like the best version of the classic WWF vision, bright lights and big spectacle, but still with a real sense of character.\n\n4. WRESTLEMANIA IX – The first time they really went wild with it, to incredible results. Outdoor major shows like this are cool as hell as a rule, but the addition of the Roman theme did a whole lot too, combined with a short and narrow entrance that’s always appealed to me. It’s a shame this was wasted on a not-great version of the show, but it’s one of the cooler looking sets ever.\n\n3. WRESTLEMANIA XXIV – Good, look at it. Another set that benefits from being in the open air, but that’s not all. It’s the perfection of the stacking screens cityscape idea that they toyed with at WrestleMania XX and the pyramid style from WrestleMania 22. Combine it with the kind of theater bill WRESTLEMANIA sign at the very top, and it’s one of the best sets of all time.\n\n2. WRESTLEMANIA 33 – Stunningly, modern WWE takes to the task of turning the biggest wrestling show of the year into a gigantic amusement park with stunning aplomb. This is another perfect example of having an idea in mind and going after it. Full and total commitment to the theme, a maximalist beauty, the best WrestleMania set in recent memory. The roller coasters, the big neon globe, the gigantic ring ABOVE the actual ring, the gigantic steps around the entrance tunnel leading to the globe that evokes the Scarface statue as much as the Universal logo. it’s all beautiful.\n\n1. WRESTLEMANIA XIX – There it is. The perfect WrestleMania set. A big video wall and a gigantic sign in the background there off to the left, the one visible in every action shot you’ll find of a match on this show. It’s big and impressive and grandiose, but it’s the ultimate version of that not being an overpowering thing. Up close, there’s something still kind of small scale about it, with the angle down the ramp (as seen in the famous Stone Cold shots) adding a character that few other WWE shows ever have been able to match.\n\nWRESTLEMANIA THEME SONGS, RANKED:\n\n(METHODOLOGY: whatever i want, eat my ass.)\n\n34. WRESTLEMANIA 38 ~ “NEW ORLEANS”, KID ROCK\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. What is that voice he’s making at the start? I grew up in the late 90s and have spent over a decade of my life living in Michigan, I’ve heard more Kid Rock than I really have ever cared to, and I’ve never heard him make that stupid fucking voice before. Beyond that this song is horrible, it’s also incredibly lazy. If just finding a song named after the city was an option, I’m kind of pissed we never got “Chicago” by Sufjan Stevens in the rotation or “Los Angeles” by Frank Black or even beginning Manias IV or V with a music video starting with “WELL THEY BLEW UP THE CHICKEN MAN IN PHILLY LAST NIGHT” (they should have done this for Mania 40 btw), etc. A colossal waste, not only in the present, but in the past as well.\n\n33. WRESTLEMANIA IV ~ “???”\n\nNothing song. No real life or character to it, feels like the sort of thing a machine could have created in 1988, real stock music stuff.\n\n32. WRESTLEMANIA 39 ~ “LESS THAN ZERO”, THE WEEKND\n\nThe first and worst of the four (5) Weeknd songs on here. No Mania vibe to it whatsoever. I would say that it belongs on a teen soap, but realistically, teen soaps also choose music with a lot more to it than this song has. Feels like AI.\n\n31. WRESTLEMANIA 37 ~ “SAVE YOUR TEARS”, THE WEEKND\n\nA perfectly fine song. Not a WrestleMania theme song. I need some excitement and tempo, a god damned PULSE, not a song I would hear on the radio when someone else is driving and go “yeah that’s fine, I can live with this for three minutes” to myself.\n\n30. WRESTLEMANIA XXX ~ “CELEBRATE”, KID ROCK\n\nOne of the best WrestleManias ever, one of the worst theme songs ever. This shit absolutely sucks. Soulless nonsense, on Kid Rock’s part, but also kind of on the WWE’s part. The nadir of the trend of Mania songs that are like, real vaguely, just about having a good fun time.\n\n29. WRESTLEMANIA 38 ~ “SACRIFICE”, THE WEEKND\n\nI have no idea why The Weeknd has had the last half decade of WrestleMania themes. Alright songs, but they really just don’t fit. Even in a sense of no longer using hard rock or nu-metal because it’s not as popular as it was, or at all, these are not songs that go well with a short little hype video or that feel exciting. This list shows, I think, that basically anything can be a WrestleMania theme song, but there are a few real misses, and the last few are all near the bottom here for a reason, totally representative of a soulless company.\n\n28. WRESTLEMANIA 35 ~ “LOVE RUNS OUT”, ONEREPUBLIC\n\nI would have said this is no Mania theme, the vocals are that, but the bass is at least more than most of the 2020s have offered.\n\n27. WRESTLEMANIA 2 ~ “THIS IS WHAT IT HAS COME TO”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nTotally okay Jimmy J track. Feels like it airs over the end credits of a 1980s cop show or something like that. You will forget it as soon as you hear it, but it is not offensive.\n\n26. WRESTLEMANIA 40, “GASOLINE”, THE WEEKND\n\nThe second best of them, even if it feels like artificial intelligence trying to make an LCD Soundsystem song.\n\n25. WRESTLEMANIA 36 ~ “BLINDING LIGHTS”, THE WEEKND\n\nThis also doesn’t totally feel like a WrestleMania song, but it is at least catchy. Great beat, up tempo, whatever. It’s a weird one though, as every promo for the show itself used a Hans Zimmer “He’s A Pirate” sort of knock off to play to that theme, so this really only exists as the theme in Youtube searches and back-from-commercial bumpers, I think. Could be higher if they did more with it.\n\n24. WRESTLEMANIA XXVI ~ “I MADE IT”, KEVIN RUDOLF\n\nPsychic harm. This song feels like not owning a fridge.\n\n23. WRESTLEMANIA XV ~ “RAGE”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nIt’s fine. I ought to have more nostalgia for this than I do, it being the first WrestleMania I watched as a young fan. I don’t really have any for it. The riff is decent, but not real great or charming or anything. It’s just some production theme that feels like it was sitting around for something else, before someone decided that with the Attitude Era shift away from the mid 90s, they should have a new theme, but without enough time for the god Jim to really cook up something great.\n\n22. WRESTLEMANIA 1 ~ “EASY LOVER (INSTRUMENTAL)”, PHIL COLLINS\n\nFor the first go around, the theme doesn’t operate QUITE like a usual show theme. There’s an opening track and a closing track (“Axel F Theme”, sadly this is only over the credits, otherwise it would be a top five entry here on song value alone), and since the opening track is typically where the theme goes, I guess this works. Sadly, it’s not the full jam, otherwise it would also be much higher. Very much something chosen because a show this big needed a theme song.\n\n21. WRESTLEMANIA 2000 ~ “CALIFORNIA”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nI think if this was just the chorus (“yeah yeah yeah ooooooooooh California”) and the other music, I could like this a lot more. The attempts to give this actual rapping verses is a real bad call though, especially as it becomes very obvious that they just didn’t want to pay the rights for “California Love”.\n\n20. WRESTLEMANIA 25 ~ “SHOOT TO THRILL”, AC/DC\n\nIt’s nobody’s fault that this later becomes part of a real cringeworthy MCU bit (that is to say it is an MCU bit), but it has ruined the song in my brain to some extent. Still, this one doesn’t have a lot of charm to it. Feels like a try at recapturing the fun retro thrill of “Big Time” (keep reading), but something about the song meshes very poorly with 2009 WWE.\n\n19. WRESTLEMANIA XXVII ~ “WRITTEN IN THE STARS”, TINIE TEMPAH FT. ERIC TURNER\n\nAn improvement over Mania 26’s in terms of using annoying early 2010s pop songs. Goes better with a commercial of a hype video. Something annoyingly catchy about it, which feels like 50% of the point in selecting one of these songs. Not great, but it is one of those ones that sticks around the memory hole for a while.\n\n18. WRESTLEMANIA 33 ~ “GREEN LIGHT”, PITBULL & LUNCHMONEY LEWIS\n\nOne of the better “big party” WrestleMania themes, even if that’s just all around less good as a concept than “watch this fight/these fights”. The horn is cute, the idea is simple enough. It’s not outstanding and many people online fell deeply in love with it in a way that defies my comprehension, but it’s a nice one.\n\n17. WRESTLEMANIA NY/NK ~ “COMING HOME”, DIDDY DIRTY MONEY\n\nIt’s fine. In terms of songs like this used for Manias in the 2010s, this is closer to “I Made It” than “Good Feeling”. There’s a sense of some nostalgia in the chorus that’s nice, and that fits the main event pretty well.\n\n16. WRESTLEMANIA III ~ “WHO’S ZOOMIN’ WHO?”, ARETHA FRANKLIN\n\nA bop. Maybe not the ideal thing for such a large event, but the song kicks a lot of ass and if you really want to squint, there’s an element of the Hogan/Andre feud that fits the lyrics. There is some room for discussion here also, as the show begins with this killer sax number, but Aretha’s song is listed as the theme of the show in multiple different places. We’ll go with that one, as it’s a little better, but the sax intro is pretty sick.\n\n15. WRESTLEMANIA V ~ “???”\n\nAnother real short sax based one, but the start of this thing feels real huge. The opposite of something like the Mania IV or Mania II songs, which are also fairly sparse, but lack the character that this brief track possesses in spades. If this was fully expanded on for a few more minutes, it might be a top ten theme.\n\n14. WRESTLEMANIA X8 ~ “TEAR AWAY”, DROWNING POOL\n\nThe first one with, arguably, two themes. “Superstar” by Saliva was also used a few times in the promotion of the event, but the commercials for the show and most results favor the Drowning Pool track. It’s a shame, because “Superstar” is a better fit for WrestleMania itself. However, there’s something to be said again for highlighting the points of the show itself, and nothing fits Triple H’s hamfisted ascension to the throne as a babyface quite like an angry white guy shouting “I don’t care about anybody else but me.”\n\n13. WRESTLEMANIA XIX ~ “CRACK ADDICT”, LIMP BIZKIT\n\nIt’s another entry from the WWE’s perfect partnership with butt rock, this time explicitly nu metal. A perfect fit, as WWE struggles to hold onto the Attitude Era and picks a 2003 Limp Bizkit song to accompany it. It’s as loud as ever, not as charming as it once was, but there’s still something I find weirdly endearing as a song as poorly conceived as this was.\n\n12. WRESTLEMANIA 23 ~ “LADIES AND GENTLEMEN”, SALIVA\n\nMore good WWE & butt rock stuff. As a song alone, I don’t love it, it’s not as good as the turn of the century stuff from Saliva that WWE used a lot of, but it works for WrestleMania. Big and loud and spectacular, a really good fit for one of the better pure spectacle WrestleManias that there’s ever been. Functional if not memorable.\n\n11. WRESTLEMANIA XXIV ~ “LIGHT IT UP”, REV THEORY\n\nAnother classic butt rock theme that’s perfect for WWE video packages. A nice little riff, shouting hyperaggressively about simply having a good time, a sort of easy listen that also feels like the WWE at this point. Not especially deep in any way, not always super memorable, but easy and generally still good. Sadly, it’s the end of an era, being the last of these as a WrestleMania theme up to the present, as the WWE switches in mid 2008 to a more spiritually and literally bloodless product, with music that emphasizes that more and more.\n\n10. WRESTLEMANIA XX ~ “STEP UP”, DROWNING POOL\n\nBig and loud and extremely stupid, ringing in the show’s twentieth anniversary with an unbelievably pissed off three minute frenzy all about challenging every single person in the world to a fight, better known for being part of THE PUNISHER soundtrack around the same time. Another one of the highlights of the WWE/butt rock alliance that held through most of the 2000s, which did and still does feel to me like a perfect marriage.\n\n9. WRESTLEMANIA 32 ~ “MY HOUSE”, FLO RIDA\n\nOne of the worst WrestleManias ever, but the theme is an ideal sort of 2010s upbeat WrestleMania theme. Another real infectious sort of earworm, which based on this, the next song on the list, and a few other hits from the time, this rotten mother fucker really had down to a science. It does the best thing a wrestling-related song can do, really, which is to say I don’t really like it in an objective sense, but because of repetition, it’s just rattled around my brain forever.\n\n8. WRESTLEMANIA 31 ~ “RISE”, DAVID GUETTA FT. SKYLAR GREY\n\nAWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nThis is all about the way it matches the commercial. The HHH/Stephanie stuff, the all-time shitty little Seth Rollins head wobble at “TAKE A RUN AT MY EGO”. Just great stuff. One of the better themes of this style, and a real guilty pleasure for a lot of us.\n\n7. WRESTLEMANIA XXVIII ~ “GOOD FEELING”, FLO RIDA\n\nI might just have a weakness for these deeply stupid Flo Rida songs?\n\nI don’t like that.\n\nThe best of all the 2010s electronic or party rap theme songs. I can’t tell why I like this one so much, relatively speaking. I just do. It is the ultimate objectively bad ear worm, sticking around my brain for at least like six months, and then another few weeks every time I’ve heard it in the decade since. It’s a perfect sort of a match to the feeling I had about that WrestleMania going into it, which was being excited about it actually, despite knowing full well that that was probably an incorrect feeling to have. An all-time guilty pleasure.\n\n6. WRESTLEMANIA 21 ~ “BIG TIME”, SOUNDTRACK OF OUR LIVES\n\nOnly the second best WrestleMania theme of this name, but one of my favorites. It’s a lovely change of pace after the previous four years’ worth of nu-metal or hard rock themes, just a cool and brisk little song about arriving at the future. There’s just something about it, the way it moves along, the “welcome to the future” line repeating, the riff being a nice little thing. It’s the sort of song that feels meant to be thrown over highlight packages and used to promote a wrestling show.\n\n5. WRESTLEMANIA(S) VI, VII, & VIII ~ “THE GRAND SPECTACLE”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nOne of James’ finest, really only behind the WrestleMania theme. The hard cut in with the riff feels like a natural extension of the sax theme from WrestleMania V, before going on to create this ball of pure energy. There’s a sense of grandeur to the thing, but it also moves around into some fun places outside of just the riff itself. If you’re older than me, and this just feels like WrestleMania to you, it’s totally fair to have it even higher. It really does whip ass in a lot of the ways some of the wrestling it represented did, definitely cheesy, but just a lot of fun.\n\n4. WRESTLEMANIA IX ~ “WRESTLEMANIA (LYRICAL)”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nStill unbelievably charming, with a little slower pace at the start, and all the people cutting promos over it. The lyrical chorus is also different. I prefer the other version, as this adds a lot of goofiness to something that I think is basically perfect, but as they are essentially the same song underneath that, it’s not too far off.\n\n3. WRESTLEMANIA 22 ~ “BIG TIME”, PETER GABRIEL\n\nI have a real nostalgia for this, but only like 50% for the song itself. It’s not about going to this WrestleMania in person either, it’s something so much dumber. I’ve talked about old group chats before, but amongst a group of guys that I’ve known since 2007/2008, a long running joke as a result of the regularity with which these WrestleMania ads aired, was to just break in and shout “BIG TIME” in a chat. Like anything, it eventually became overused as a result of how funny it was, but it’s still the sort of thing I have a real fondness for.\n\nThe song also totally rules, and as a result of how old it was relative to the show it was used for and also the sort of song that it is, stands as a total departure from the norm for WWE. It feels appropriately grand at the same time as it feels weird and funny, and so it is one of my absolute favorites.\n\nIt should be the WrestleMania theme song every year.\n\nBIG TIME.\n\n2. WRESTLEMANIA(S) X, XI, XIII, 13, & XIV ~ “WRESTLEMANIA”, JIM JOHNSTON\n\nIt’s perfect. Just a great fucking song. It improves on the original try at it by not only removing the lyrics, but making the introduction shorter and adding this great drop into one of Jim Johnston’s all time greatest riffs. On a personal level, as the sort of kid who used to constantly rent old wrestling tapes once I got real deep into it and saw basically all the big stuff from like 92-97 as a result, something about this one has always felt really correct. It’s still cheesy and a little goofy even without the promos over the music, but there’s also something real triumphant about the whole thing. The apex of in-house event themes.\n\n1. WRESTLEMANIA X7 ~ “MY WAY”, LIMP BIZKIT\n\nThe greatest of all time. Absolute banger, and I don’t know if I would have thought that forever if not for its association with this show, and especially the all-time great hype video it’s used for. The greatest WrestleMania naturally has the biggest feeling theme ever, working hand in hand to raise each other up like that. A company at the peak of its powers and perhaps the peak of its cultural relevancy picking a perfect song for one of the biggest shows of all time, as well as for that cultural moment. One of the all time best marriages between event, match, moment, and music.\n\nReading all of this has made you dumber."
