        "text": "In response, Austria-Hungary set Serbia an ultimatum. If Serbia failed to meet its demands, the Austro-Hungarian army was going to invade Serbia. The Serbs accepted all demands, except one. They wanted to investigate the murder themselves, without interference from the Austro-Hungarian representatives. Austria-Hungary did not agree and on 28 July 1914 declared war on Serbia.\n\nThe fact that this crisis resulted in a world war was due in part to the alliances between the various European countries. As many states were bound by treaties to help one another in the event of war, there were two camps: the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary and Germany) and the Allied Powers (France, Russia and England).\n\nBoth sides expected the war to be over soon, but they were wrong. The First World War lasted four years, and millions of soldiers from all over the world were killed.\n\nIn August 1915, Otto Frank went into the German army. He was trained as a gunner. From the autumn of 1915 onwards, he was stationed at the Western Front. He was part of a so-called Lichtmesstrupp: a unit that detected and calculated the location of enemy guns and passed information about the trajectory on to the artillery.\n\nIn 1916, he took part in the Battle of the Somme, in which almost half a million German soldiers were killed. A year later, Otto was promoted to sergeant and the year after that to officer candidate.\n\nOtto's brothers Herbert and Robert served in the German army as well. Their mother Alice Frank-Stern and sister Leni Frank were nurses in a military hospital.\n\nOn 18 July 1925, Hitler’s book, Mein Kampf (‘My Struggle’) was published. He wrote it in prison, where he was serving a sentence for a failed coup he attempted in 1923.\n\nIn Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote about his ideology and presented himself as the leader of the extreme right. He talked about his life and his youth, his 'conversion' to antisemitism (the hatred of Jews) and his time as a soldier in the First World War.\n\nHe raged against the Treaty of Versailles and the reparations that Germany had to pay because of the Treaty. He did not believe in parliamentary democracy. Mein Kampf is full of racist ideas and hatred of Jews and communists.\n\nIn Mein Kampf, Hitler also wrote a lot about the future of Germany. He wanted to expand the German territory in Eastern Europe and to throw the Jews out of Germany, since he believed they threatened the survival of the German people. Although Mein Kampf does not refer to the later mass murder of Jews during the Second World War (the Holocaust), it does show that he had already developed a hatred of Jews at this time.\n\nAnne Frank was born on 12 June 1929 in Frankfurt, at the Maingau Red Cross Hospital. She weighed over 8 pounds and was 54 cm long. Margot was taken to see her the next day and very happy with the arrival of her baby sister. Ten days later, Anne and her mother Edith were allowed to go home.\n\nUntil March 1931, Anne and her family lived at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt am Main. It was a pleasant time for Anne and Margot. It was a neighbourhood with lots of children and almost every day, friends came over to play with Margot. Anne could often be found in the sandbox in the garden. She was still too young to be allowed out of the garden. Margot was allowed to leave the garden, though, and she often played in the street with her friends.\n\nOn 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor, leader of the German government. The Nazis’ desire for power was fulfilled. ‘It is like a dream. The Wilhelmstraße (the street where the Chancellery is located) is ours’, Joseph Goebbels, the future Minister of Propaganda, wrote in his diary.\n\nThat same evening, the Nazis held a torchlight procession through Berlin. Uniformed members of the SA (Sturmabteilung - Nazi fighters) marched under the Brandenburg Gate and past the new address of their leader. Despite the impressive propaganda images Goebbels would produce later, not all Germans were impressed. Many of them did not expect Hitler to last very long at all.\n\nAfter his appointment, Hitler was still no autocrat. His new cabinet contained only two members of his own party, the NSDAP. The other ministers came from other right-wing parties. Nonetheless, Hitler managed to get his people appointed to important positions. Wilhelm Frick was appointed Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring took control of Prussia's police force. As a result, Hitler became relatively powerful in Germany.\n\nAnne Frank came to Amsterdam in February 1934. Her father Otto had been living there for over six months. He had left Germany for the Netherlands in July 1933 to set up his company Opekta. Edith joined him in September and started looking for a house. Meanwhile, Anne and her sister Margot stayed with their grandmother in Aachen.\n\nMargot came to Amsterdam in December and Anne followed in February. Margot started school in January and Anne in April. She learned Dutch quickly and had no trouble making new friends.\n\nOtto about Anne: ‘As soon as she entered the living room, things got turbulent, especially since she often took a whole bunch of friends home. She was very popular because she always had ideas about the games they could play or the things they could get up to.'\n\nIn the morning of 7 March 1936, German troops occupied the Rhineland, a part of Germany that bordered on France. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed to station an army there.\n\nHitler took a big risk, as he did not know how the Allies would react. He only deployed 3,000 soldiers. He had police officers march along to increase the visual impact. They had all been ordered to withdraw if foreign countries were to intervene.\n\nBut nothing happened. Other countries took hardly any countermeasures. Germany's old enemies, France and England, were busy dealing with domestic problems of their own and did not want to get involved in another war. Others felt that Germany was entitled to reclaim the Rhineland. The area had always been German until after the First World War, and Hitler's predecessors had wanted it back as well.\n\nThe gamble paid off for Hitler. It encouraged him to try to break other international agreements with impunity. Moreover, by occupying the Rhineland, he had also taken away France’s strategic advantage, and that would come in handy in a new war. He was now able to reposition his troops along the French border. In Germany, his popularity was growing because he had erased the 'disgrace' of the Treaty of Versailles. Once again, Germany was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe German invasion surprised the Soviet leadership. Stalin, the country's dictator, had not believed that Germany was sufficiently prepared for war. But then, neither was he, and so the German troops were able to advance without much resistance. Hitler hoped that winning the war would not take long, because the strategic position and the grain and oil reserves of the Soviet Union were indispensable if Germany wanted to keep Europe in its grip. During the first nine months of the advance, one million German soldiers were killed.\n\nGermany was waging a war of destruction against the Soviet Union. It was the largest communist country in the world and the Nazis considered the communists their greatest enemies, in addition to the Jews. Moreover, the Nazis regarded the Russian people and the peoples in the Asian part of the Soviet Union as inferior. They would have to make way for German settlers. For that reason, the German army treated the population and the captured soldiers inhumanely. Millions of people died of hunger or diseases, or were executed.\n\nIn the morning of 4 August 1944, Otto Frank was helping Peter van Pels with his language lessons. Edith was in her room. Police officers turned up at Prinsengracht 263 in Amsterdam. They went up to the office on the first floor where the helpers of the people in hiding were working. The police officers questioned Victor Kugler and searched the building in his presence. They ended up on the landing with the revolving bookcase and discovered the hiding place and the people who lived there.\n\nTogether with two of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, the people from the Secret Annex were taken to the SD prison on Euterpestraat. They were interrogated one by one to find out whether they knew of any other addresses where people might be in hiding. Johannes and Victor kept silent. Otto Frank said that after 25 months in the Secret Annex, they had lost all contact with friends and acquaintances and therefore knew nothing.\n\nAfter the interrogations, the people from the Secret Annex and the helpers were separated. Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler were taken to the detention centre at Amstelveenseweg, the eight people from the Secret Annex to the detention centre at Weteringschans. Helpers Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl were not arrested. After a little while, they went up to the empty hiding place. There, they discovered Anne's diary papers, which were left behind after the arrest. Miep held on to the diary until after the war.\n\nBy the autumn of 1918, it became clear that Germany was not going to win the war. Its opponents had too much economic and military strength. Besides, more and more allies of Germany were giving up the fight. Germany itself was in great turmoil as well. There was no other option than to end the war.\n\nOn 9 November 1918, the Allies and the Germans convened in a railway carriage in the forest of Compiègne, a small town 60 kilometres to the north of Paris. The German delegate Matthias Erzberger tried to negotiate about the terms of the armistice. The Allies did not yield. They wanted Germany to surrender. Two days later, on 11 November, Germany signed the truce, which started at 11.00 am on the same day.\n\nGermany lost a lot because of the armistice. The agreement demanded that all German troops would withdraw from French and Belgian territory within two weeks. The Rhineland, an area bordering on Belgium and France, was to be occupied by Allied troops. Germany had to return territory in Eastern Europe it had conquered during the war. Moreover, Germany had to donate large quantities of military equipment to the Allies.\n\nOn 6 April 1917, American president Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany. Until that day, the United States had remained neutral. The declaration of war was a response to the submarine war that Germany had been waging on its enemies since January 1917.\n\nGermany wanted to sink all ships sailing toward the United Kingdom, including passenger ships and neutral American ships, as they could be carrying aid - from food to soldiers - for Germany's opponents. Germany knew that the United States would respond, but they believed that the United States would take so long to prepare, that the British would have quit their efforts by then. But they were wrong.\n\nAnother reason for the American declaration of war was the interception of the so-called \"Zimmermann telegram”, in which Germany promised Mexico financial support and American territory if it would attack the United States. Mexico refused the request. The telegram had been sent in code, but it was deciphered by the English secret service. The Americans were outraged.\n\nIn 1917, the United States sent more than a million troops to France. It took another year before they were fighting alongside the Allies in substantial numbers.\n\nOn 23 March 1933, the German parliament voted in favour of the ‘Enabling Act’ by a large majority. The Act allowed Hitler to enact new laws without interference from the president or the Reichstag (German parliament) for a period of four years.\n\nIn his speech on that day, Hitler gave those present the choice 'between war or peace'. It was a veiled threat to intimidate any dissenters. With 444 votes in favour and 94 against, the Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act. Only the Social Democrats voted against it. The vote could hardly be called democratic: The Reichstag was surrounded by members of the SA and the SS, the armed branches of the NSDAP. The Communist Party was absent because its members had been arrested or were on the run. Twenty-six Social Democrats did not vote for the same reason.\n\nThis law allowed Hitler to rule Germany as a dictator from then on.\n\nOn 1 December 1933, the German government adopted a law stating that the NSDAP and the German State were inextricably linked. This meant that the government was bound to support the Nazi party and that the party also had power outside of the government. For example, the NSDAP now was entitled to arrest people itself.\n\nThe law was the official confirmation of a situation that had existed for some time. In the preceding months, the Nazis had dealt with the other political parties in Germany. The Communist Party and the Social Democrat Party had been banned. Other parties had dissolved themselves.\n\nA law of 14 July 1933 made the NSDAP the only political party in Germany and prohibited the creation of new political parties. On 12 November 1933, new parliamentary elections were held. There was only one party on the ballot: the NSDAP, with Hitler as its leader.\n\nOn July 6, 1938, American president Roosevelt organised an international conference on Jewish refugees from Germany. Thirty-two countries convened in the French town of Évian-les-Bains. Among the participants were the United States, England, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, Mexico, and a number of South American states.\n\nMost government leaders said that they sympathised with the Jewish refugees, but they did not want to admit more refugees. They had already taken in so many refugees and were afraid of tensions between the newcomers and their own populations. Haiti and the Dominican Republic were the only countires willing to accept tens of thousands of refugees, but the United States would not allow Haiti's offer. In the end, several hundred Jews found refuge in the two countries.\n\nAnd so, the conference yielded no measures to improve the situation of the Jewish refugees.\n\nShortly after the conquest of Western Europe, Germany attacked the United Kingdom. It had to do so by air because the British Navy was stronger than the German Navy. In July 1940, Germany started making air raids on ports and ships, airports, and places along the coast of England. Hitler had planned to invade England with an army, but this turned out to be impracticable because the German Air Force was unable to gain the upper hand. On 25 August 1940, the British Air Force bombed Berlin. This counter-attack did not cause much damage, but it did change the German plans.\n\nStarting on 7 September, London was bombed for 57 consecutive days, and other English cities were hit hard as well. The German air raids continued into the autumn of 1941. They are collectively called \"The Blitz\", after the German word for lightning.\n\nThe Battle of Britain cost 27,450 lives and even more people were wounded. More than a million houses were destroyed. But the United Kingdom did not succumb, and Germany lost the Battle of Britain.\n\nOn 21 September 1942 Anne wrote a short note to Jettje in her diary. A little further on, she wrote another one to Emmy. One day later, on September 22, she wrote to Kitty: ‘Dear Kitty...I like writing to you most, you know that don’t you, and I hope the feeling is mutual’. Yet she still wrote to Pop, Jackie, Marianne, Conny, and other girls.\n\nShe had invented most of these names, but not all of them. Jackie was Jacqueline, one of her best friends. To her sorrow, Anne had not had a chance to say goodbye to her before going into hiding. Kitty was not made up either. She was a character from the books about Joop ter Heul, written by Cissy van Marxveldt. Anne was very fond of this series. She described Kitty as 'a nice 14-year-old girl' and said that they were becoming ‘the best of friends’.\n\nOn 28 March 1944, the people in hiding in the Secret Annex heard an appeal on Radio Orange from Dutch minister Bolkestein. He was a member of the Dutch government, which had fled to London (Great Britain) in 1940.\n\nBolkestein asked the Dutch to hold on to any papers that would illustrate what they had gone through during the German occupation once the war was over. Letters, for instance, or diaries, or speeches. His request inspired Anne and she planned to publish a book about her time in hiding after the war. She also came up with a title: ‘Het Achterhuis’ or ‘The Secret Annex’. But she had her doubts, too.\n\n'I really believe, Kits, that I'm slightly bats today, and yet I don't know why. Everything here is so mixed up, nothing's connected any more, and sometimes I very much doubt whether in the future anyone will be interested in all my tosh.\n\n\"The unbosomings of an ugly duckling\" will be the title of all this nonsense. My diary really won't be much use to Messrs. Bolkestein or Gerbrandy (members of Dutch cabinet, ed.).\n\nYours, Anne\n\nFriday 14 April 1944.\n\nAfter early July 1941, people in the Netherlands could no longer obtain visa for the United States, so neither could Otto and his family.\n\nOtto had applied for entry to the United States in 1938. Because many Jews wanted to flee Germany after 1938, there were so many applications that it took a very long time before his application was processed.\n\nOn 14 May 1940, the consulate in Rotterdam was destroyed in the heavy bombardment of the city. As a result, all records were lost. All applicants had to collect and resubmit the required documents. To make matters worse, the American government had become stricter because it feared letting in German spies.\n\nOtto, too, continued with his application, but he suffered a severe setback. Every immigrant had to be interviewed at the American consulate as part of the application, but in July 1941, the consulate in the Netherlands was closed. Even if he had been invited for an interview, he would have had to go to a consulate in Southern Europe. And that had become impossible by then.\n\nOtto started another application for visa for Cuba. This was cancelled on 11 December 1941. After that, he had no real options left for taking his family to a safe country.\n\nOn 16 November 1942, Fritz Pfeffer went into hiding in the Secret Annex. He was the dentist of Miep Gies and an acquaintance of Otto and Edith Frank. His fiancé Charlotte Kaletta had been a guest at the wedding of Miep and Jan Gies the previous year.\n\nPfeffer had told his landlord that he would be hospitalised. He was surprised to see the Frank family again. He had heard that they had fled to Switzerland. Fritz was to share Anne’s room with her. Before his arrival, Margot had slept there; from then on, she slept in her parents’ room.\n\nCharlotte was left behind. She was not Jewish and not in danger of being arrested by the Nazis. He did not tell her where he went, so she could not accidentally betray him. He missed her very much, but they stayed in touch. They wrote letters to each other, and Miep Gies acted as their messenger.\n\nOn 20 July 1944, during a meeting with Adolf Hitler, German officer Claus von Stauffenberg placed a bomb under the table. After Von Stauffenberg had left, the bomb went off. As if by a miracle, Hitler survived the attack. He had some burns and abrasions, and the bang had ruptured his eardrums. That very evening, his voice could be heard on German radio to let the people know that he was still alive.\n\nThe conspiracy of which Von Stauffenberg was a member, had failed. A large number of German army officers had wanted to get rid of Hitler. The people involved each had their own reasons for participating in the conspiracy. Some wanted more influence and power, others wanted to prevent Hitler from destroying Germany in a senseless war.\n\nShortly after the attempt, hundreds of arrests were made. The leaders of the attempt were sentenced to death in a show trial.\n\nIn November 1942, resistance fighter Helena Kuipers-Rietberg started setting up an organisation to help people go into hiding. Through her work for a Christian women's organisation, she knew many people. That same month, she asked the Reverend Frits Slomp for help. He was very much opposed to the Nazis and travelled across the Netherlands to find hiding addresses and host families.\n\nIn the course of 1943, the National Organisation to Help Those in Hiding - the LO for short - arose from this network. Many existing resistance groups joined the LO. The LO arranged hiding addresses for Jews and for young men who did not want to work for the Nazis.\n\nLater on, National Fighting Squads (Landelijke Knokploegen) were erected that would, for instance, raid distribution offices to steal food stamps for people in hiding.\n\nIn August 1944, Helena Kuipers-Rietberg and her husband were arrested by the Sicherheitsdienst. During the interrogation, she took all the blame to make sure that her husband was released. Helena ended up in German concentration camp Ravensbrück. Weakened by illness, she died there on 27 December 1944.\n\nIn January 1944, the Jewish Mr and Mrs Wittenburg were arrested by ‘Jew hunters’, Dutch police officers who were looking for Jews in hiding. From the police station, they were taken to Westerbork. Then they were deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Heintje, the wife, was gassed in April 1944. Bram, her husband, was liberated by the Soviet army in 1945.\n\nBy the autumn of 1943, most Dutch Jews had been deported. But many Jews were still in hiding and the Nazis wanted to find them. Because the Dutch police was not cooperative enough for their liking, they set up special divisions with pro-German police officers to hunt down Jews. Among those officers were confirmed antisemites, who hated Jews, as well as opportunists, who were primarily interested in the premium they received for every Jew they caught, and in the belongings of the people in hiding and those accommodating them, which they secretly took during the raids.\n\nOn 3 September 1944, the people from the Secret Annex were transported by train from the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands to Auschwitz-Birkenau in occupied Poland. With 1,011 other Jews, they were packed tightly in closed goods carriages. Two and a half days later, they arrived in the night.\n\nThey had to get off the train and leave their luggage behind. Men and women were separated. Auguste van Pels was separated from Hermann and Peter. It was the last time Otto Frank saw his wife and daughters.\n\nNext, the Germans assessed which of the prisoners were fit for work. The people from the Secret Annex were deemed fit, but 371 of their fellow prisoners were not. They were sent to the gas chambers. The people from the Secret Annex were sent to the so-called Sauna, where a number was tattooed on their arm, and where they showered and dressed again in camp clothes or whatever else was available.\n\nEdith, Margot, Anne, and Auguste stayed in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp and ended up in a barracks for forced labourers. Otto, Hermann, Peter and Fritz had to walk to camp Auschwitz I, three kilometres away. They were made to do heavy labour.\n\nAfter their arrest, helpers Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler were held prisoner in Amsterdam from 4 August to 11 September. They stayed in adjacent cells. Then, they were taken to the Amersfoort prison camp. This was a SS prison camp for political prisoners and other criminal cases.\n\nJohannes Kleiman had been convicted of Arbeitsverweigerung (refusal to work). He did not stay at the prison camp long. He had been unwell for a long time, after suffering gastric haemorrhaging. Therefore, he could not be sent to Germany to do forced labour and, at the insistence of the Red Cross, was released seven days later.\n\nVictor Kugler had been convicted of Judenbegünstigung (helping Jews). He was held captive for a longer period. After spending almost three weeks at the camp, he had to do forced labour in various places across the Netherlands. In March 1945, he was marching to Germany in a group of around 600 prisoners. Near the German border, they were fired at by allied planes, which gave him a chance to escape. A few days later, he was back home in Hilversum, where he hid until the German capitulation on 5 May.\n\nIn July 1945, Otto Frank met with sisters Janny and Lientje Brilleslijper. They had been imprisoned at Bergen-Belsen with Anne and Margot. They told him about the miserable last months of his daughters and how they had died of typhus.\n\nMiep, too, heard the terrible news. She had kept Anne’s diaries for her. Now that Anne was not coming back, she handed them to Otto.\n\nFor some time, Otto could not summon the courage to read them, but once he started reading, he was gripped by her writing. ‘I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings.’\n\nOtto copied passages from the diaries and asked relatives and friends to read them. Some of them felt that he should publish the diary. Others were set against it. Otto eventually decided to go ahead and compiled a manuscript for publishers to read.\n\nBy the summer of 1944, the Germans were losing more and more territory to the Soviet army. The front was shifting to the west so fast that the Nazis were afraid that their concentration and extermination camps would be discovered. And so, Himmler, head of the SS, decided to bring prisoners from Eastern Europe back to Germany. The camps would be emptier, the prisoners would not be able to tell the enemy anything, and they could still be used as forced labourers.\n\nFirst, the prisoners were brought west by train. But from the autumn onwards, with the Soviets advancing, the prisoners had to walk long distances. The prisoners called these marches death marches. Under severe winter weather conditions, they were made to walk hundreds of kilometres without warm clothes and shoes, food or shelter. Those who were unable to keep up, were shot or beaten to death. Chances of survival were very slim indeed.\n\nAfter the liberation of France and Belgium in August and September 1944, the Allies wanted to move into Germany. But the German defence line at the border with Belgium was too strong. British general Montgomery decided to get round it by going via the Netherlands.\n\nMontgomery had a bold plan: Operation Market Garden. He wanted to conquer important bridges in the east of the Netherlands, so that the Allied Forces could cross the rivers to move into Germany. This would also allow them to surround the German army in the west of the Netherlands. The bridges had to be taken by paratroopers and airborne troops, while tanks were moving over land to provide reinforcements. For Montgomery's plan, it was crucial to have the Allied troops in Arnhem before the German reinforcements got there. The finale of the operation was near Arnhem, where the last strategic bridges were located.\n\nThe liberation of the south of the Netherlands in the autumn of 1944 affected the occupied west of the Netherlands in a bad way.\n\nThe Dutch government in London called for a major strike in railway transport to support Operation Market Garden on 17 September 1944. 30,000 railway workers went on strike. The trains stopped running until the end of the war. But as a punitive measure, the Nazis blocked food transports to the provinces of North and South Holland for six weeks. Using their own trains, the Germans had no trouble taking care of their own supplies.\n\nThe supply of coal from the province of Limburg had become impossible, because Limburg was behind the front line between Germany and the Allies.\n\nMoreover, in December 1944, the rivers and IJsselmeer, the largest lake of the Netherlands, froze over. So, nothing could be transported by water either.\n\nIn 1963, former Nazi Karl Silberbauer was arrested in Vienna. He was the SD man who had arrested the eight people in hiding in 1944. Since 1946, he had been a policeman in Vienna, just like he had been before the Second World War. Silberbauer was tracked down by Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.\n\nIn a written statement, Silberbauer said that he would probably have forgotten about the arrest of the people in hiding if Anne Frank and her diary had not become so well-known. He recalled many details about the arrest, but nothing about a traitor.\n\nThe Viennese police suspended Silberbauer during the investigation, but he was allowed to come back to work when he could not be prosecuted. In 1944, he had acted 'by order' and during the arrest he had behaved 'correctly'.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. Luxembourg was occupied that same day. The Netherlands surrendered on 15 May, Belgium on the 28th. At first, Great Britain supported the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, but it withdrew later.\n\nOn 5 June, the Wehrmacht, the German army, launched a major attack on France. On 14 June, the German army occupied Paris. The French government and many Parisians had already fled the city by then. The French government failed to lead its army properly and they lost the trust of their people. The French Prime Minister resigned and was succeeded by Marshal Philippe Pétain.\n\nOn 22 June, the French army signed the capitulation in a railway carriage near Compiègne, a small town 60 kilometres to the north of Paris. The location bore special significance for the Germans. This was the place where Germany had signed its surrender in 1918, at the end of the First World War. Many Germans had considered it a great humiliation.\n\nGermany did not occupy all of France. South of the front line, there was a new French government led by Marshal Pétain. This 'Vichy regime', named after the health resort where the government was based, collaborated with the Germans. Not all French people accepted the new situation. Some joined the resistance and others fled to London. General Charles de Gaulle founded the Free French there, with the aim of fighting the German occupation of France.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Netherlands declared war on Japan. Together with its allies the US, Great Britain and Australia, the Netherlands formed an army. The name of the army was ABDACOM: American-British-Dutch-Australian Command. ABDACOM was set up to prevent Japan from invading East Asia. They were not successful. Between December 1941 and February 1942, Japan conquered Malaysia, Singapore, and large parts of the Dutch East Indies.\n\nOn 27 February 1942, a Japanese fleet was on its way to set troops ashore at Java (Dutch East Indies). The allied ABDACOM fleet tried to stop the invasion. The ships were under the command of Dutch Admiral Karel Doorman aboard HNLMS De Ruyter.\n\nThe Japanese fleet was too strong. It had more ships, better weapons, and reconnaissance planes. The ABDACOM fleet’s communication equipment was poor. In a seven-hour naval battle, the Allies lost five ships and more than 1,000 men. In the following days, the Japanese navy destroyed the remaining ships.\n\nOn 28 February 1942, the Japanese troops landed on Java. For the remainder of the Second World War, the Netherlands did not play a military role of any significance.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Nazis organised Einsatzgruppen (special units) in the newly conquered territories. These ‘death squads’ were set up to kill Jews and communist officials. They received help from the Wehrmacht (regular German army).\n\nThe units summoned their victims to report at a central point or rounded them up in raids. Then, they executed them on the edge of ravines or alongside the holes they had had to dig. Sometimes, they put Jews in ghettos first and killed them later.\n\nOne of the most notorious massacres took place at the ravine of Babi Jar near Kiev in September 1941. An attack by the NKVD (the Soviet secret service) had damaged the army headquarters of the Germans. The Nazis decided to exterminate the Kiev Jews in retaliation.\n\nEinsatzgruppe C put up pamphlets summoning the Jews to report for migration. More than 30,000 Jews headed the summons. They were then taken to the ravine of Babi Jar. Once they got there, they were forced to undress and hand over all their belongings. Then they were shot.\n\nIn this way, Einsatzgruppe C and its local collaborators murdered 33,771 Jews within two days. By the end of 1941, the Einsatzgruppen had murdered around 300,000 Jews. Six months later, the number had risen to approximately half a million. The victims were Jews as well as tens of thousands of Soviet officials, partisans, disabled people, and Roma.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, the Nazis started preparing for a major project: the murder of more than two million Jews who lived in the occupied part of Poland. The order was issued by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. After an attack on SS man Reinhard Heydrich in June 1942, the project was named after him: Aktion Reinhard.\n\nThe Nazis built three extermination camps to carry out their project. These camps were located in areas that were hard to reach: Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka. The Majdanek work camp already existed but was expanded with gas chambers. The camps were completed in the spring of 1942. The Jews from the ghettos were put on transport to the camps and murdered in the gas chambers upon their arrival.\n\nBy the end of 1942, almost 1.3 million Polish Jews had been murdered. In November 1943, Aktion Reinhard was terminated. The camps were emptied, and the bodies of the victims were excavated and burned. Then the Nazis planted trees on the grounds to wipe out all traces of their crimes. All Jewish prisoners from camp Majdanek were murdered.\n\nIn total, this project resulted in the murder of more than two million Jews. The Polish Jews were not the only ones who were murdered in the camps: victims also included Jews from France, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and the Balkans. In Sobibor, over 34,000 Dutch Jews were murdered in 1943.\n\nOn 8 August 1941, the Liro bank opened at Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. It appeared to be another branch of the Jewish Lippmann Rosenthal & Co. bank, but it was not. The bank was a looting bank, set up by the Nazis to steal money and valuables from Jews.\n\nThe Nazis took many measures to rob Jews in the Netherlands of their possessions. From 8 August 1941 onwards, Jews had to hand over all cash and assets over 1,000 guilders to the Liro bank. They were no longer allowed to have accounts with other banks. In September, Jews had to report any land they owned. In May 1942, they had to hand in other valuables, such as jewellery, gold, art, and antiques.\n\nFrom January 1942, shares owned by Jews were sold on the stock exchange. Their art works were sold as well or ended up in German museums. The proceeds did not go to the original owners, but to the Liro bank. In 1943, the Liro bank terminated the life insurance policies of Jews and retained the sums that were paid out.\n\nThe money was used to pay for the deportation of Jews by trams and trains. It also paid for the expansion of the Westerbork transit camp and the construction of the Vught concentration camp.\n\nIn total, the Liro bank robbed the Dutch Jews of an incredible amount of money; estimates range from 325 to 455 million guilders.\n\nOn 16 April 1947, Rudolf Höss was hanged in the courtyard next to the former crematorium of Auschwitz. Höss was the Commander of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. In this role, he was responsible for the deaths of nearly one million Jews and other prisoners in the camp.\n\nAfter the war, Höss lived under a false name for a while, but in March 1946 a British team tracked him down. After his arrest, he testified in the Nuremberg Trials. The Allies handed him over to Poland, because Auschwitz was on Polish soil during the German occupation. And so, Höss was tried in Poland.\n\nIn his cell, he wrote an autobiography. Although he regretted what had happened, Höss did not admit his guilt. He said that he had only followed orders. In March 1947, the court ruled that Höss was guilty and imposed the death penalty.\n\nOn Sunday morning, 7 December 1941, a Japanese war fleet arrived at the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, on Hawaii. The Japanese bombarded the Americans with bombs and torpedoes. When the attack was over, more than 3,500 American were left dead or wounded. Eighteen warships had been sunk and hundreds of aircraft had been destroyed or damaged.\n\nJapan attacked the United States to prevent the Americans from thwarting Japanese plans for expansion in Asia. The surprise attack was carried out to perfection, but Japan did not defeat the US. The damage caused was soon repaired and the main American aircraft carriers were in other ports at the time of the attack. The United States were able to retaliate quickly.\n\nOn that same day, Japan also attacked Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, as well as American bases in the Philippines and Guam. As a result, Japan was now at war with Great Britain and Canada. Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands also declared war on Japan, and the war spread rapidly across the East-Asia.\n\nThe American population regarded the attack as a cowardly act and stood behind its government's decision to declare war on Japan. In response, Hitler declared war on America on 11 December 1941, for Germany was an ally of Japan. This meant that Hitler had gained another strong opponent. From then on, the United States fought with the Allies against Nazi Germany.\n\nOn 20 January 1942, fifteen high-ranking Nazis gathered in a villa on the Wannsee, a large lake in a suburb of Berlin. At this conference, they discussed the planned murder of eleven million European Jews.\n\nFor a while, the Nazis had thought that they could force the Jews to emigrate to other countries, but this was no longer an option because of the war. Instead, the Jews were to be 'evacuated' to the east. A large proportion was expected to fall away due to 'natural reduction'. The remaining Jews would receive 'appropriate treatment'.\n\nThe participants in the conference hid their real intentions behind official language. These words come from the minutes of the conference, which were preserved. What they say, is that the Nazis were organising a genocide. ‘Evacuation' equalled deportation to concentration and extermination camps, and the 'appropriate treatment' meant 'murder'.\n\nHitler had already decided that all European Jews must be murdered. From July 1941 onwards, German special units (Einsatzgruppen) had been active in the Soviet Union to kill Jews. And since the spring of 1941, there had been executions in occupied Yugoslavia. By early 1942, the Nazis had already murdered more than a million Jews.\n\nOn 29 April 1942, the Nazis introduced another humiliating measure that concerned the Dutch Jews. From 3 May onwards, they would have to start wearing a badge on their clothes: a six-pointed yellow Star of David with the word 'Jew' in the middle.\n\nThe badge made it possible to identify people in the street as Jews. The Nazis wanted to further isolate the Jews from the non-Jewish Dutch. Not wearing the badge was severely punished. You could even be sent to a concentration camp if you didn’t.\n\nThe Jewish Council was ordered to distribute the badges among the Dutch Jews within three days. The Jews were forced to buy four each at four cents a piece. Children from the age of 6 had to wear them, too. In total, 569,355 yellow badges were distributed.\n\nSome Jews wore them with pride, many others felt humiliated. Some non-Jewish Dutch responded to the new measure as well. Some protested by wearing homemade stars with the words 'Catholic' or 'Aryan'. Others made a point of greeting Jews in the street or giving up their seats on the trams. But over time, the indignation diminished and the gap between Jews and non-Jews widened.\n\nOn 5 July 1942, Margot received a call-up to report for labour camp in Germany. She was among the first group of Jews in the Netherlands to be summoned. Her parents did not want her to go, but those who did not go, were arrested. Otto and Edith had anticipated the call-up and had planned to go into hiding in the hiding place Otto had set up in the annex of his business premises on 16 July 1942. Because of Margot's call-up, they advanced their move.\n\nThey left their home the morning after the call-up. They told their subtenant that they were going to Switzerland.\n\nA few days later, Anne wrote about being in hiding in her diary.\n\n‘Of course we are not allowed to look out of the window at all or go outside. Also we have to do everything softly in case they hear us below.’\n\nThe Frank family were helped by six of Otto’s employees and friends. The people working in the ground floor warehouse knew nothing about the hiding place, except for the father of helper Bep Voskuijl. As the warehouse manager, he was well-placed to keep an eye on things.\n\nOn 31 January 1943, German Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus and his Sixth Army surrendered to the Red Army (the army of the Soviet Union). The Sixth army had been virtually annihilated. After five months of fighting, Germany was defeated.\n\nIn late August 1942, the German army had begun a major attack to gain control of the Russian city of Stalingrad. The conquest would not only serve a strategic goal, it would be of great symbolic value, since the city bore the name of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.\n\nThe shellings and and bombardments damaged Stalingrad badly, but in order to conquer the city, the German soldiers had to fight the soldiers of Red Army in the streets. They were shot at by snipers, hiding among the ruins. When the harsh Russian winter began, the situation grew even worse.\n\nFor the Red Army, the winter had its advantages. The ice was now thick enough for tanks to cross the rivers. While the fighting in the streets continued, the Soviets managed to surround the city with their tanks in late November 1942. The German army was trapped but did not surrender straight away. It took another six weeks for the battle to be over. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers had died on both sides.\n\nThe Battle of Stalingrad was an important turning point in the war. The German army was not unbeatable after all. The Soviet Union regained hope, as did the people in the occupied territories.\n\nOn 20 May 1943, approximately 750 Jews reported to the military police building near Muiderpoort train station in Amsterdam. They complied with a measure taken by Rauter, head of the German SS and the police, that no Jew could stay in Amsterdam without permission. Only Jews carrying a so-called Sperre, a proof of postponement, were allowed to stay on.\n\nThey arrived in Westerbork in the evening. At least two of them, a couple, were put on transport five days later to the Sobibor extermination camp, where they were gassed on 28 May 1943. We do not know what happened to the others, because their names are not known.\n\nRauter was dissatisfied with the low turnout on this day and so, the Germans held a big raid in the centre of Amsterdam a few days later. They arrested around 3,000 people, who were subsequently deported to Westerbork. The Nazis also forced the Jewish Council to take away the Sperre of a large number of Jews and to select them for transport to Westerbork.\n\nOn 6 June 1944, shortly after midnight, D-Day, a huge military operation, began. Over 5,000 ships transported 150,000 allied soldiers and 1,500 tanks to the coast of Normandy in France.\n\nFor two years, the Allies had been preparing for 'Operation Overlord'. The purpose of the operation was to set up a landing base on the European mainland. From there, the Allies would be able to liberate the countries that had been occupied by Germany and move on towards Berlin. And if Germany also had to fight in the West, it would make things a bit easier on the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Germans were expecting an attack at Calais, not Normandy, for at Calais, the English Channel (the sea between England and France) is at its narrowest. The Wehrmacht had stationed half a million troops all along the French coast. They had also set up the Atlantikwall, a solid line of defence.\n\nThe Allies landed in a few places along the coast of Normandy. The attack was backed up by bombardments and paratroopers. In some places, they were easily able to push back the German defence, but in others, resistance was fierce. On ‘Omaha Beach’, the American bombers did not manage to hit the German line of defence well. There, German troops shot down the soldiers trying to land. Some did not even get that far and drowned as soon as they left their ships.\n\nBy the end of D-Day, the Allies had established a base on the mainland. The Germans tried to hold out as long as possible It took another two months of fighting in Normandy before the Allies succeeded in moving further into France. On 15 August, the Allies also landed in the south of France. Paris was liberated on 25 August and by mid-September 1944, the German army had almost been forced out of France.\n\nOn 2 May 1945, Soviet troops occupied the Berlin Reichstag and planted the Soviet flag on its roof. It was the culmination of a two-week battle for the German capital.\n\nThe military operation started on 16 April with a major attack on the Seelow Heights, the German defence line near the river Oder. During this attack, the Soviet army fired one million grenades. All night, the horizon was lit by explosions and the searchlights that dazzled the German army. After two days of heavy fighting, the Red Army broke through the German defence, and on 25 April, the Soviet army had surrounded Berlin.\n\nHitler had ordered his troops to defend the city ‘to the last man’. The streets were barricaded, to stop the tanks and soldiers from coming through.\n\nDue to a shortage of soldiers, the boys of the Hitlerjugend and the old men of the Volkssturm were ordered to help defend the city. With their small arms and grenades, they did not stand a chance against the Red Army, and many of them died a pointless death.\n\nOn 2 May, Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin defence forces, surrendered. Germany was now almost completely defeated.\n\nThe first Nuremberg Trial lasted from 20 November 1945 to 1 October 1946. Twenty-four Nazi leaders were tried for their crimes during and before the war. Not all top Nazis could be tried. Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels had already committed suicide. Other Nazis were missing or on the run.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal presided over the trial. There were eight judges, two from each of the allied countries: France, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. The Nazis had been indicted on four counts: conspiracy, starting a war, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe tribunal imposed twelve death penalties. Seven convicts were given prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. Three defendants were acquitted. Two others were not prosecuted.\n\nAfter the trial against the leaders, twelve other trials followed, against doctors, army officers, judges, industrialists, members of the Einsatzgruppen, and others.\n\nOn 11 May 1960, Adolf Eichman was kidnapped in Buenos Aires by a unit of the Mossad (the Israeli secret service). The commando team smuggled him out of the country and took him to Israel, where he was put on trial.\n\nBy that time, Eichmann had been on the run for 15 years. After the Second World War, he had moved to Argentina under a false name, because he was afraid of being prosecuted for his war crimes. As an SS man, he was responsible for the deportation of Jews to concentration and extermination camps. Eichmann had been an important link in planning and carrying out the murder of the European Jews and is therefore also called the 'architect' of the Holocaust.\n\nThe trial against Eichmann started a year later and took four months. The whole world witnessed it, because it was reported on TV, radio, and in the newspapers. Due to the many testimonies during the trial, the general public got to know the gruesome details of the Holocaust. For the first time, the persecution of the Jews was widely discussed. Eichmann was sentenced to death and hanged on 1 June 1962.\n\nMany intellectuals and artists were happy about the war as well. They hoped for change and action. In the warring countries, many people felt closer to their compatriots as they faced a common enemy. They saw the enemy as the instigator of the conflict and so they considered their own reaction to be fair. Moreover, almost everyone expected the war to be short and to end in victory.\n\nThe farmers were less enthusiastic. Now that they and their sons had been drafted, they would be unable to bring in the harvest. Pacifists and socialists even protested against the war. The socialists considered war a power game of the ruling classes, and they believed that the workers of the world should unite instead of shooting one another.\n\nIn July 1941, the Nazis set up a POW camp at Trawniki, a village in the General Government for the occupied Polish Region. The camp was intended for Soviet soldiers captured after the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet prisoners of war were offered a way out of captivity by cooperating with the SS as Hilfswilligen (relief troops). The ones who accepted the offer were mainly anti-communist and antisemitic Ukrainians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. They were trained in Trawniki and deployed from September 1941 onwards. As the war with the Soviet Union became less successful and the number of prisoners of war dwindled, regular civilians were recruited as well. Over 5,000 men were trained in the camp.\n\nThe Hilfswilligen helped the Nazis with the raids and the evacuation of the ghettos in occupied Poland. They were involved in actions against the partisans and supported the Einsatzgruppen. They worked as guards in the extermination camps and operated the killing facilities there.\n\nFrom the summer of 1942 onwards, Jewish forced labourers were imprisoned in the camp. They had to endure the cruel treatment by the camp leadership and their disciples.\n\nIn July 1944, the camp was abandoned by the Nazis and discovered by the Soviet army.\n\nIn early 1959, Otto Frank brought legal action against the German teacher Lothar Stielau. This right-wing extremist had written in his school’s newsletter that Anne Frank's diary was a forgery. After an investigation into the authenticity of the diary, the court ruled that the diary was genuine. Stielau retracted his remarks and came to a settlement with Otto Frank.\n\nThis was the first, but by no means the last time Otto had to go to court to defend Anne's diary against similar accusations.\n\nThere are several reasons why people claim that the diary is not real. One of the main reasons is that they are trying to prove that the Holocaust never took place. By casting doubt on the testimonies, they hope to show that the Nazis were not as bad as they are portrayed. They often use seemingly scientific arguments that are difficult to check for lay people. However, historians have no doubts about the reality of the murder of six million Jews during the Second World War.\n\nAs the leader of the SS, Heinrich Himmler was involved in numerous war crimes. The murder of Jews, Roma and Sinti, and political opponents took place under his responsibility.\n\nIn April 1945, when the war was almost over, Himmler tried to escape punishment by negotiating with the Allies. In exchange for the German surrender, he demanded immunity. The Allies refused and put him on the list of wanted war criminals.\n\nHimmler then assumed a false identity. On 22 May 1945, British soldiers arrested him at a border check. His brand-new passport and nervous behaviour gave him away. Himmler was sent to a prison camp for questioning. The next day, he announced his identity. During a medical check-up, he suddenly bit through a cyanide capsule that had been hidden in his mouth. Fifteen minutes later, the poison had killed him. His body was buried in an anonymous grave on the Lüneburger Heath.\n\nSince the Hollandsche Schouwburg was too small for the large number of people who had been arrested, the children were put in a nursery which was located opposite the Schouwburg, on Plantage Middenlaan. The head was Henriëtte Pimentel, a member of the resistance. The nursery garden was adjacent to that of the College of Education. Together with the director of this school, Johan van Hulst, Pimentel devised a plan to save the children.\n\nWith the help of the director of the Hollandsche Schouwburg, German Jew Walter Süskind, they ensured that the children disappeared from the German records. The children were then smuggled out through the College of Education: hidden in bags, suitcases, or between the dirty laundry, or simply walking out, when the guards were not paying attention. About six hundred children were saved in this way.\n\nAnne Frank heard the bombardment, as the Secret Annex was only a few miles away.\n\nOn 19 July 1943, she wrote: 'North Amsterdam was very heavily bombed on Sunday. There was apparently a great deal of destruction. Entire streets are in ruins [...] We've been told of children searching forlornly in the smouldering ruins for their dead parents. It still makes me shiver to think of the dull, distant drone that signified the approaching destruction.’\n\nThe people in hiding were aware of the danger of a bombardment. They would not be able to leave their hiding place for a shelter. Moreover, they stood a chance of being discovered if the Secret Annex were damaged.\n\nOn 25 July 1943, Anne and the other people in hiding saw ‘columns of smoke over the harbour'. Fokker had been bombed for a second time. This time, the factories were partially hit. Three days later, the Allies tried again, but they still did not succeed. Seventeen civilians were killed in this bombing. Anne wrote in her diary: ‘I decided to grit my teeth and practise being courageous.’\n\nIn total, the three bombing raids on the Fokker factories took the lives of over 200 people.\n\nAfter Yom Kippur - on September 21, 1942 - the German authorities informed the Jewish Council that no Jews would be brought to Germany for the time being and that there would be few or no arrests. This message soon became known to all Jews and it gave great relief. On October 3 and 4, Sukkot would be festively concluded with Simchat Torah, and many people gather on such days.\n\nBut the Nazis were gruesomely misusing the Jewish holidays. They had planned raids all over the country. On Friday 2 October in the evening until the next day, they picked up all families whose men were staying in labor camps and transported them to Camp Westerbork. Under the guise of family reunification, the fathers, sons and brothers, who had not been home for more than six months, were taken from the labor camps to Camp Westerbork as well.\n\nThe Westerbork population increased with about 13,000 residents in two days, while there was only room for about 3,000 people. Barracks became overcrowded and thousands of people had to sleep on the floor.\n\nThe promise that no Jews would go to camps in Germany turned out to be a lie of the Nazis: in October 1942, nearly 12,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz by nine trains.\n\nWesterbork is a transit camp\n\nOn 1 July 1942, the Nazis had taken control of the old Westerbork refugee camp. It was fenced off using barbed wire and the camp was now called a ‘Police Transit Camp’ (‘Polizeiliches Durchgangslager’). From 15 July onwards, almost all Jews from the Netherlands were first taken to this camp and then sent on to German concentration and extermination camps. They usually went to Auschwitz-Birkenau in occupied Poland, but the trains sometimes stopped along the way to drop the men off at German labour camps.\n\nOn 3 October 1942, as many as 24 trains had already made the journey to Auschwitz, together carrying a total of 19,000 prisoners. Most of the prisoners were murdered upon arrival. People in the Netherlands, however, knew nothing about this.\n\nIn August 1942, the former Hollandsche Schouwburg theatre in Amsterdam became a deportation centre for Jews. The Nazis called it ‘Umschlagplatz Plantage Middenlaan’. Jews went there voluntarily after receiving a call-up or were dropped off after a raid or arrest. They were then transported to Camp Westerbork. In all, tens of thousands of Jews were at some point imprisoned at the Hollandsche Schouwburg.\n\nThe Hollandsche Schouwburg was not big enough to accommodate the many Jews who had been arrested. Some stayed there for a longer period of time, so it quickly became overcrowded. The commotion and the stench were hard to bear. On 25 March 1943, Jewish Willy Alexander wrote in his diary:\n\n'At the moment there are 1300 people in the small \"Hollandse Schouwburg\". It's so hot and stuffy (and dirty, of course) that everyone keeps asking for something to drink.'\n\nThe Hollandsche Schouwburg was closed at the end of 1943. By that time, Amsterdam was 'Judenfrei' - almost all Jews had been deported.\n\nAnne Frank wrote of the news in her diary: ‘Rauter, some German bigwig, recently gave a speech. \"All Jews must be out of the German-occupied territories before July 1st. The province of Utrecht will be cleansed of Jews (as if they were cockroaches) between April 1st and May 1st, and the provinces of North and South Holland between May 1st and June 1st.\" These poor people are being shipped off to filthy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick and neglected cattle. But I'll say no more on the subject. My own thoughts give me nightmares!’\n\nRauter’s enthusiastic antisemitism was expressed clearly in his speech to Dutch SS members: 'In this way we want to expel the Jews, who are the source of all unrest and terror here, as quickly as possible from the general populace. It is no mean feat to have pulled 130,000 Jews, who would probably have grown to a million in one hundred years’ time, from the healthy German populace. We want to continue these measures relentlessly, because in doing so we are doing the Germanic people a service. That is why we will show no weakness in this matter.'\n\nBetween 13 and 15 February 1945, the Allied air forces bombed the German city of Dresden four times. The entire city was destroyed.\n\nAs they used firebombs, the German population was not even safe in the air-raid shelters. Over 20,000 people died and many more were injured. Most of Dresden’s historic city centre was destroyed. This bombardment was one of many strategic bombardments carried out by the Allies. They did not attack specific targets but entire cities. They wanted to destroy the German infrastructure and industry and break the spirit of the German people. By causing as much damage and inflicting as many casualties as possible, they hoped to bring the war to a quick end.\n\nThe Germans saw the bombardment as proof of the cruelty of the Allies, their enemies. They called it 'terror bombing’.\n\nIn July 1942, at the same time as Margot Frank, about 4,000 Jews were summoned to report for ‘unemployment relief work under police supervision’ or, in other words, forced labour.\n\nJust like with the Frank family, sometimes only the minors in a family received a call-up. Many people did not trust the authorities and decided not to register. The German police responded by raiding South Amsterdam and the centre of the city on 14 July. Approximately 700 people were arrested. They were released when 200 people reported for work after a few days.\n\nThe next day, the first train left Amsterdam Central Station for the Westerbork transit camp, carrying 962 Jews. On that same day, the first train drove from Westerbork to the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp, with 1137 Jews on board. One week later, two more trains ran to the transit camp. All through July of 1942, trains ran from Westerbork to Auschwitz, with thousands of Jews on board.\n\nBecause too few people reported for deportation after receiving their call-ups, the Nazis held raids to pick up additional people. They cordoned off streets, arrested people in the streets, or picked them up from home. They also threatened to send people who failed to report to the infamous Mauthausen concentration camp, which was considered a death sentence. Later, the Nazis were assisted by the Amsterdam police to pick up Jews from their homes.\n\nOn 30 April 1945, Hitler and his wife Eva Braun committed suicide. On the previous day, Hitler had dictated his will to his secretary. In it, he praised the struggle of the German people and blamed the Jews for the war. As he didn’t want to fall into enemy hands, he had chosen to die. The rest of the will specified who was to be his successor.\n\nWhen Hitler committed suicide, he had been hiding in the 'Führerbunker' in the centre of Berlin for more than three months. In this underground shelter, he and the people around him had heard how the Soviet Union army was getting closer and closer. During his last days, no one could go outside because of the incoming shells. It was clear that Germany had finally lost the war. After his death, SS officers carried Hitler and his wife out of the bunker. Their bodies were drenched in gasoline and set on fire. The next day, the news of Hitler's death was announced on the radio. The wording suggested that Hitler had died a heroic death defending the capital of the German Empire.\n\nOn 1 October 1944, German troops surrounded the village of Putten in Gelderland. No one was allowed in or out. The reason for the raid was an attack by a resistance group on Wehrmacht officers. A German and one of the resistance fighters had died. After being warned by an officer who had managed to escape, the German commander-in-chief (Wehrmachtsbefehlshaber in den Niederlanden) Christiansen ordered this retaliatory action.\n\nAll inhabitants of Putten had to report at Kerkplein square, in the middle of the village. Only the sick, the elderly, and mothers with babies were allowed to stay at home. In the square, the Germans separated the men from the women. More than one hundred houses were set on fire and seven people were shot. In the evening, all women, as well as men under the age of 18 or over 50 were allowed to go home.\n\nThe remaining men were locked up in a school and an industrial building for the night. On 2 October, they were called outside. Those who were members of the NSB or collaborated with the Germans were free to go. The 659 remaining men were taken to Camp Amersfoort. A few dozen were released from there. The others were transported to the German camp Neuengamme. During the ride, thirteen men managed to escape by jumping from the train.\n\nAt Neuengamme and other camps, the men had to do heavy labour. Most of them died after a few months of exhaustion, malnutrition, and disease. Only 48 of them survived the ordeal.\n\nFrom the autumn of 1944 onwards, the Nazis became ever more violent. They frequently responded to resistance acts by executing innocent civilians.\n\nOn 4 September 1944, Antwerp was liberated by the Allies. The Belgian port of Antwerp was one of the largest ports in Europe and very important to the Allies, but their ships were unable to reach the port at that point, for the Germans still controlled the Western Scheldt. This is the wide river between Zeeland Flanders and the island of Walcheren, connecting the port to the North Sea.\n\nOn 11 September, the Allies went into battle. It took them almost two months of heavy fighting to conquer Zeeland Flanders. On 1 November, Canadian and British armies used landing craft to cross the Scheldt from Zeeland Flanders and drive the Germans off the island of Walcheren. They had bombed the dikes of the island in advance, flooding the land. The Germans surrendered on 8 November. Only after the naval mines had been cleared, the Scheldt was finally opened up to Allied ships on 28 November.\n\nThe forced takeover of Gerzon house of fashion was part of the ‘aryanisation’ of the economy by the Nazis. New legislation allowed them to force the Jews to hand over their businesses and assets or to sell them at far too low a price to 'Aryan' Germans and Dutch people. The German state and individuals benefited enormously from this robbery.\n\nTwo weeks later, all of Gerzon's Jewish employees were dismissed. Around 300 of them would not survive the war.\n\nDirector Julius Eduard Gerzon managed to emigrate to Portugal in 1942. Sick and destitute, he died in a hospital in Lisbon in December of that same year. His mother and his son were murdered in the Sobibor extermination camp.\n\nThe Jewish Council had been established on 13 February 1941 at the insistence of the Nazis. The Germans wanted all of the Amsterdam Jews to be represented by the same body. Shortly before, there had been major riots between Jews, Dutch Nazis, and the German police. From then on, the Jewish Council was expected to keep the Jewish community in line. In October 1941, the Jewish Council was given a national role.\n\nThe anti-Jewish measures were announced in Het Joodsche Weekblad, and the Council had to implement some of them. In May 1942, the Council had to distribute the yellow ‘Stars of David’ and from July 1942 onwards, they made lists of the people who were to be deported. The Jewish Council also handled the registration of the Jewish prisoners in Westerbork.\n\nIn September 1943, when there were almost no Dutch Jewish people left, the leaders of the Jewish Council were deported as well and the Jewish Council ceased to exist, as did Het Joodsche Weekblad.\n\nOn 3 February, on the orders of the Nazis, the Dutch authorities announced that all Jews must register with their municipality as Jews or 'bastard Jews'. This information was added to their personal data in the population register. To make their cards easier to retrieve, a tab was added to each card with either a ‘J’ or a ‘B’. Every registered Jew received a certificate of registration to take home. The municipalities forwarded the registrations to the national population register in The Hague.\n\nThe Jews had no idea of what lay ahead. And so, almost all of them did what they were told to do. In August 1941, the numbers were added up: 140,552 Jews, 14,549 Half-Jews and 5,719 Quarter-Jews. 160,820 registrations in all.\n\nThis was how the Nazis got a hold on the Jews in the Netherlands. The SS officer responsible for the programme was Friedrich Wimmer, who described it as follows: ‘This will ensure the rapid handling of any possible changes, such as relocations.’ (‘Der enge organisatorische Anschluss des Zentralregisters an die Bevolkingsboekhouding (Bevölkerungsbuchhaltung) in den Niederlanden sichert eine schnelle Erfassung aller eintretenden Änderungen (z.B. Wohnungsänderungen)’)\n\nThe registration made it possible to remove Jews from the Netherlands. In April 1941, the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) was established for this purpose.\n\nIn November 1943, the United States launched a major offensive against Japan. They planned to advance to the Philippines and to oust the Japanese army from the islands. But Japan occupied countless islands in the Pacific and was very difficult to beat. In order to conquer the islands, the Americans came up with a strategy they called leapfrogging. They did not attack the most important or best defended islands, but the islands surrounding them. This way, they were able to isolate the Japanese units and cut them off from their supply lines, without losing much time or troops in combat.\n\nThe attack began on the Gilbert Islands between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. On 20 November, the American fleet started shelling Tarawa, one of the islands. Initially, it was hard going. The Japanese were prepared for an invasion and had deployed additional troops. Due to the low tide, the American landing ships could not get close enough to the beach and the soldiers had to wade through the water. In the afternoon, the Americans managed to land in several places. After that, the Japanese started losing ground, and on 23 November, the Americans had won the battle.\n\nThe Americans lost 1700 men. Nearly 4700 Japanese soldiers died. They fought to the death. Only 17 of them were made prisoners of war.\n\nAfter the First World War, Germany had major financial problems. The German government had paid for the war with borrowed money, which had to be repaid. On top of that, they also had to make reparations to France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, and Great Britain.\n\nSince the German economy did not yield sufficient income, for instance from trade with foreign countries, there was not enough money to pay the debts. In order to make money, the government decided to increase the production of unbacked bank notes and exchange them against foreign currencies. This led to hyperinflation: a huge reduction in the value of money. Between August 1922 and December 1923, 1 American dollar increased in value to 4.2 billion German marks.\n\nPeople’s savings became worthless and they had to resort to bartering, while many lost their jobs and their savings. Only in the course of 1924 did a new government succeed in reducing inflation by introducing a new currency: the Rentenmark.\n\nHindenburg’s quotation refers to the Stab-in-the-back myth. According to this conspiracy theory, the German army had not been defeated on the battlefield, but because social democratic politicians had signed the truce in order to take control. In reality, the army command had made mistakes and the German army was in no shape to keep on fighting. But generals like Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff spread the story to avoid having to admit the mistakes they had made.\n\nRight-wing extremist, nationalist, and antisemitic groups believed that this ‘stab in the back’ was the work of an international Jewish conspiracy.\n\nEven during the war, fabrications were circulating about the supposed lack of patriotism among the German Jews. For that reason, the German government introduced a ‘Judenzählung' (count of Jews) in the army in 1916. It proved that the number of Jews fighting at the front was proportionate. The results of the investigation were not made public, though.\n\nSlanderous propaganda such as the Stab-in-the-back myth contributed to antisemitism and hatred of the social democratic government. In 1921, members of a Freikorps murdered politician Matthias Erzberger, who had signed the armistice in 1918. Several Jewish and social democratic politicians were to fall victim to right-wing extremist assassinations in the years that followed.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Germany was in a political and economic crisis. In this chaos, right-wing extremists and nationalists tried to increase their power. Among them were Adolf Hitler and Erich Ludendorff, a general from the First World War. They felt that the time had come for a coup d’état. They planned to seize power in the German free state of Bavaria and then march on to Berlin to depose the government.\n\nOn the evening of 8 November 1923, Hitler, together with SA members (Sturmabteilung - the fighting team of the NSDAP), forced his way into the Munich Bürgerbräukeller. At that moment, a meeting of Bavarian politicians was in progress. Hitler drew his revolver and shot in the air to draw their attention. He declared that the 'national revolution' had begun. Hitler then retreated to a side room with three of the politicians. He made them promise to support his plans to overthrow the government in Berlin. However, the three of them retracted their promises the next day, and called in the police and the army.\n\nHitler and his supporters responded by organising a protest march through Munich. They hoped that the people and the army would join them. Their plan failed. The police were waiting for them and a gunfight ensued. Sixteen of Hitler's comrades were killed by police bullets, among them the man walking next to Hitler.\n\nTwo days later, the police arrested Hitler at his hiding place. During the trial, the judges turned out to be sympathetic to Hitler's defence that he had wanted to save Germany. The press reported extensively on the process, giving Hitler a podium to present himself and his ideas. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, of which he served only eight months in a prison where he had a lot of freedom. This was where he wrote his book Mein Kampf.\n\nThis rush was a reaction to the global financial crisis, which had begun in October 1929 with the great crash, the collapse of stock prices at the Wall Street Stock Exchange in New York.\n\nUp until then, German companies had been borrowing money from banks in the United States, and these loans had helped the German economy back on its feet. The German state had also borrowed money to make the reparations payments laid down in the Treaty of Versailles. However, because of the crisis, the American banks had stopped lending money.\n\nGermany depended on these loans, and so, the German economy was suffering. The Danat-Bank went bankrupt. German investors and savers no longer trusted other banks either. They withdrew their savings and exchanged them for foreign currencies. To stop them, on 13 July 1931, the government closed the banks for a period of three weeks and prohibited the exchange of the Reichmark. After this period, the economic crisis only deteriorated.\n\nOne month later, Germany signed a treaty with Japan: the Anti-Comintern Pact. In this treaty, the two countries agreed to support each other in the fight against communism. Italy joined the pact a year later.\n\nIn 1939, Germany and Italy expanded their cooperation in the Pact of Steel: they promised to help each other if one them went to war with another country. During the Second World War, Germany mainly supported Italy, which turned out to have a much weaker army.\n\nOn 27 September 1940, Germany, Italy, and Japan agreed on military cooperation in the Tripartite Pact. From that moment on they were called the Axis Powers, which referred to the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. Several of Germany's allies later joined the Tripartite Pact: Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Croatia.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1938, about 25,000 German-Jewish refugees came to the Netherlands. Most of them used the Netherlands as a stopover and travelled on to other countries. The government did not want to attract refugees, and so they made it difficult for refugees to start new lives in the Netherlands.\n\nIn January 1938, strict measures were introduced. The government stipulated that, in principle, no more refugees were to be admitted. From that moment on, every refugee was considered an undesirable alien, unless there was evidence that their life was in danger.\n\nWhen thousands of Jews fled Germany and Austria after the Kristallnacht, the pressure on the Dutch government increased. They decided to let in seven thousand people.\n\nThese refugees left Germany for fear of persecution. They ended up in camps, without any freedom of movement. Two thousand illegal refugees ended up in separate camps under military supervision.\n\nNot only Jews, but social democrats and communists (the left-wing political opponents of the Nazis) also fled to the Netherlands. Some of them were also Jewish and faced double danger. The communists were supported by the Dutch Red Aid, a communist organisation that helped thousands of people. The Dutch government, on the other hand, opposed the arrival of the 'red refugees' and often sent them back. Even people who had fled concentration camps were sometimes extradited to Germany.\n\nTens of thousands of Jews left Germany and Austria for the Netherlands in the hope of escaping the Nazis. Many of them travelled on to other countries, but they did not always succeed. There was a single centre for the Jews who stayed behind in the Netherlands: the Central Refugee Camp Westerbork in the province of Drenthe. The government made the Dutch Jews pay for its construction.\n\nConstruction of the camp started in the summer of 1939. Workers in a state employment scheme (a government policy to keep the unemployed busy) built the barracks. The first Jewish refugees were admitted to the camp in October. They were passengers of the St. Louis, a ship which had not been allowed to moor in Cuba and had been sent back to Europe. These refugees helped to finish construction of the camp.\n\nAfter two days, Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Bernhard decided that Bernhard would flee the country with his wife Princess Juliana and their two children because their safety could not be guaranteed. In IJmuiden, they boarded a torpedo-boat to Harwich (England). A few hours later, Wilhelmina also left for Harwich. King George VI welcomed them. A few hours later, the Dutch government also escaped to England. General Winkelman was now the highest authority in the country.\n\nWhen the news came the next day that the queen and her cabinet had fled the country, it came as a big blow to the Dutch people. Up until that point, the newspapers had mainly reported on the military successes of the Dutch. The situation turned out to be more serious than people had expected. Some criticised the queen and called her a coward. During the occupation, however, the queen came to be an important symbol of the fight against Nazi Germany.\n\nIn the summer of 1939, Adolf Hitler ordered two SS officers to organise the murder of the incurably ill. He wrote: ‘Reichsleiter Bouhler and Dr. med. Brandt are instructed to broaden the powers of physicians designated by name, who will decide whether those who have - as far as can be humanly determined - incurable illnesses can, after the most careful evaluation, be granted a mercy death.’\n\nThese two Nazis set up a large-scale ‘euthanasia’ or ‘mercy killing’ programme: children and adults suffering from incurable mental or physical conditions could in some cases be murdered. The Nazis considered these people a threat to the health, strength, and survival of the German people. After all, they were unable to work and, according to the Nazis, taking care of these people simply cost too much money.\n\nThe doctors involved sent questionnaires about patients’ health and capacity for work to institutions and nursing homes. The real reason behind the questionnaires was not revealed. The completed forms were used to determine which patients qualified for ‘euthanasia’. These patients were then picked up and taken to hospital. From here, they were taken to euthanasia centres and killed within the next 24 hours. They were then cremated there. The families of the deceased received death certificates with false causes of death, such as pneumonia or appendicitis.\n\nHowever, the euthanasia programme did not remain a secret for long. The death certificates were not always credible, the smoke of the crematoria in the euthanasia centres was a give-away, and there was no trace of the patients. After protests from a number of church leaders and from the population, Hitler stopped the programme on 24 August 1941. By then, 70,000 people had been murdered. However, the programme was continued in secret, and the murder centres were afterwards also used to kill prisoners.\n\nThe Nazis tried out different methods and, in consultation with Hitler, decided on carbon monoxide gassing. Special gas chambers were built for the purpose. Many of the perpetrators later used their know-how and experience in the mass murder of Jews in Eastern Europe.\n\nBecause of the address of the Berlin headquarters, Tiergartenstrasse 4, the mass murder of the incurably ill became known as Aktion T4.\n\nThe Piotrków ghetto was open, but most ghettos were enclosed by walls, fences, and barbed wire. The purpose was to sever relations between the Jews and non-Jews. Moreover, it gave the Nazis control over their living conditions. The inhabitants of a number of ghettos, such as that of Łódź, worked as cheap forced labourers in German factories.\n\nLiving conditions in the ghettos were appaling. People were unable to arrange food or medical care on their own. Living quarters were cramped because they had to share their homes with other Jews, who were often strangers. Non-Jewish Poles who helped them were severely punished. Many Jews died of hunger and disease.\n\nThe number of people living in one ghetto ranged from 500 to tens of thousands. The largest ghetto was established in Warsaw in October 1940. It housed around 450,000 Jews, more than half of whom came from other towns.\n\nSome ghettos were dismantled over time and their inhabitants were moved to other ghettos. However, most Jews remained in the ghettos until 1942, when the Nazis deported them to the newly built extermination camps.\n\n90% of the Jewish population of former Poland was murdered by the Nazis: almost 3,000,000 people.\n\nAccording to the National Socialist ideology, the Roma and Sinti, like the Jews, are inferior races. After the Nazis came to power, they made life difficult for the Roma and Sinti. They were no longer allowed to practise their traditional professions, for instance as musicians. In some cities, Roma and Sinti were forced to live in segregated camps where conditions were poor. Children were placed in children’s homes. Moreover, the Nazis sterilised Sinti and Roma so that they would no longer be able to bear children.\n\nIn September 1939, shortly after the start of the Second World War, the SS decided to transport the 30.000 Roma and Sinti living in Germany to labour camps in the occupied region of Poland. Their deportation in May 1940 was the first step. In 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered all Sinti and Roma from Germany and the occupied territories to be deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Most of the deportees were murdered there.\n\nSinti and Roma from the occupied countries of Europe were also sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and murdered there. The total number of victims runs into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe Roma and Sinti call the mass murder of their people porajmos, 'the devouring'.\n\nOn 22 October 1940, more than 6500 Jews from the federal states of Baden and Saarpfalz were assembled and deported to a camp in Gurs, in the south of France. It was the largest mass deportation since the start of the Second World War. The Jews were taken by surprise as the event took place during the Feast of Tabernacles, a Jewish holiday.\n\nThe deportation began after the victory over France, when Nazi leaders from Alsace and Lorraine deported Jews to Vichy France. When Hitler heard about their actions, he ordered them to clear their territories of Jews and make it ‘Judenfrei’. This motivated them to pick up Jews from the border regions of Baden and Saarpfalz and put them across the border as well.\n\nJews from all villages and towns in the area were assembled at train stations. From there, they were taken by train to the unoccupied part of France. The French government was unable to refuse the Jews and it sent them on to the Gurs prison camp in the Pyrenees. The journey took four days. Some people were able to escape because the trains stopped frequently.\n\nIn camp Gurs, living conditions were very bad. People had to arrange for their own food. Men, women, and children lived in separate parts of the camp. One third of the deportees managed to survive by going into hiding in France or by fleeing abroad. In 1942, the remaining Jews were transferred to the Nazis and deported to concentration and extermination camps in occupied Poland.\n\nThe deportations from Baden and Saarpfalz were a test round for the deportations of Jews from Germany and the occupied territories that were to come.\n\nThousands of Jews were taken from Vienna to the General Government (part of the occupied Polish region) as early as 1939. In October 1941, the Nazis started deporting Jews from other parts of Germany as well. They took them to ghettos, labour camps, and concentration and extermination camps in the General Government in Poland and to newly conquered parts of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 19 May 1943, the Nazis pronounced Germany to be ‘Judenrein’, free of all Jews. However, there were still about 20,000 Jews in Germany, including those who were married to Aryans or people living in hiding.\n\nIn total, the Nazis murdered approximately 165,000 German Jews.\n\nIn the course of a two-day raid in Paris and the surrounding area, the French police arrested more than 13,000 foreign Jews by order of the Nazis. Among them were 4000 children. More than 8000 people were temporarily locked up in the ‘Velodrome d'Hiver’ cycling stadium. The others were sent on to the Drancy transit camp, just outside Paris, or to other camps in the countryside. Living conditions were poor. In the weeks that followed, the Jews were deported to Auschwitz, where most of them were murdered straight away.\n\nThe Nazis had started arresting Jews the year before, and after the major raid of July, Jews were also arrested in other parts of France. The French police collaborated.\n\nIn France, the government was more involved in the persecution of Jews than, for instance, in the Netherlands. As a result of ecclesiastical protests against the deportations, French minister Laval asked the Nazis, as a compromise, to arrest mainly foreign Jews. Most of the 75,000 Jews deported from France to extermination camps had come from abroad. Many of them had fled to France from Nazi Germany and the occupied territories in the 1930s. The majority of the 130,000 French Jews were not arrested, and survived the persecution of the Jews.\n\nOf the 1500 transports arriving at Auschwitz, only one has been photographed: the train that entered Auschwitz-Birkenau on 26 May 1944. It carried Jews that came from the north of Hungary. Two SS men took pictures of the people getting off the train. The photos show that they had to line up in front of SS officers. The men and women who have been selected for forced labour are handed camp clothes before entering the camp. Another group of people is waiting near the gas chambers.\n\nThe train brought in 3500 of the 437,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz between 15 May and 8 July 1944. Almost all of them were murdered.\n\nIn March 1944, Nazi Germany occupied Hungary. Until then, Hungary had been an ally of Germany, but the Hungarian government no longer believed in a German victory and wanted to make peace with the Allies. Germany responded by taking over and installing a government that was willing to cooperate with the Nazis.\n\nThe Nazis took the opportunity to kill the more than 700,000 Jews living in Hungary. SS officer Adolf Eichmann came to the country to organise the transports. Auschwitz-Birkenau was being equipped to cope with the large number of new prisoners. The new train track that led into the camp is shown in the pictures.\n\nIn Hungary, as in other countries, ghettos were built where the Jews were made to stay until their deportation. As in the other occupied countries, they had to wear the yellow Star of David on their clothes. The Hungarian police assisted in their arrest and deportation. The Jews from Budapest, the capital, were the last in line. They were made to live in large apartment buildings that were marked with yellow stars.\n\nThe transport of 15 May 1944 was the first of 151 transports that took thousands of Jews a day to Auschwitz-Birkenau. On the 8th of July, the transports were discontinued by Miklós Horthy, Hungary’s head of state. The Allies and the Pope had pressured him to do so after they had received reports about the fate of the Jews in Auschwitz.\n\nIn October 1944, an antisemitic party came to power and resumed the persecution of the Jews. 80.000 Jews were shot in Budapest, and thousands more were killed in other actions. 568,000 Hungarian Jews died between 1940 and 1945.\n\nIn October 1941, the Nazis decided that Jewish people who were unemployed would be sent to labour camps. Many of them had lost their jobs due to anti-Jewish measures. The Jewish Council was charged with selecting the men. A lot of people tried to avoid going, but they usually did not succeed.\n\nThe labour camps had been built in the 1930s. Most of these camps were located in the Dutch provinces of Groningen, Drenthe, and Overijssel. The government had set them up to have unemployed men make the barren soil suitable for agriculture. The labourers had to work the land and build roads. In 1941, they were replaced by unemployed Jews.\n\nThe first group of 905 Jews left for the camps on 10 January 1942. Because the ground was frozen stiff, at first, there was little they could do. The work was hard and conditions were poor. Later on, even Jews who still had jobs were made to work in the camps. By September 1942, more than 5,000 Jewish men had been sent to the labour camps.\n\nUp until then, only the British Air Force, supported by other Allied pilots, had carried out attacks on Germany.\n\nUntil the end of 1944, the Allied bombardments were the only experience the German population had with the force of war. Many planes and crew members were lost. The Allies bombed factories, traffic junctions, and military installations on a weekly, sometimes daily basis, as well as residential areas in cities and towns. The bombings were intended to destroy the German air force and oil industry, and the British also hoped to hurt the morale of the German people and undermine their support for Hitler's dictatorship.\n\nFlights departed from England, from southern Italy (after the summer of 1943), and from France (after the summer of 1944). Only in 1944 did the Allies gain control of European airspace. At that point, they flew as far as the occupied region of Poland to bomb German factories.\n\nThe bombings killed approximately 410,000 German civilians.\n\nCapitulation\n\nItaly grew tired of the war because of the military setbacks. Ever fewer people in the government and the military top wanted to continue fighting the Allies. On 24 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism took a vote of no confidence in Benito Mussolini, Italy's political leader. The next day, the Italian king fired him and a new government was formed.\n\nMussolini was arrested and Italy began peace negotiations with the Allies. However, as soon as Italy capitulated, the Germans intervened and occupied Italy to prevent the Allies from advancing.\n\nBy the end of 1943, the Allies had conquered the south of Italy as far as Naples, at a great loss of troops and resources. They planned to move on to Rome and take the rest of Italy.\n\nBy the end of 1943, the Allies had conquered the south of Italy as far as Naples, at a great loss of troops and resources. They planned to move on to Rome and take the rest of Italy.\n\nHowever, the German army had built a heavy line of defence between Rome and Naples: the Gustav line. One of the most notable spots along the line was Monte Cassino, a hill with a monastery from the sixth century at the top.\n\nHeavy bombardments by the U.S. Army severely damaged the monastery. It made this part of the German defence line all the stronger and almost impossible to take. In order to weaken the German army, the Allies attacked further north, landing on the coast near Anzio from the sea, but they were not successful.\n\nIt took four attacks to break the German defence line in May 1944. After heavy fighting, a Polish unit reached the top of Monte Cassino and planted the Polish flag among the ruins of the destroyed monastery.\n\nThe road to Rome lay open. On 4 June 1944, American troops seized the Italian capital. It would still take a long time to conquer the rest of Italy. Only after months of heavy fighting did the Allies reach a new German line, north of Florence. The frontline stayed in place until the spring of 1945. The attention of the Allied Forces had switched to the battle in north-western Europe.\n\n55,000 allied soldiers lost their lives in the Battle of Monte Cassino. On the German side, the losses were much smaller: 20,000 soldiers died.\n\nOn 8 May 1943, the Nazis in the Netherlands announced the introduction of labour deployment (Arbeitseinsatz) for all Dutch men aged 18 to 35. This meant that they would be forced to work in Germany. The Dutch were required to show up and report for deployment. There were too few Germans left to do the work, because most of them had been drafted.\n\nThe Nazis had expected to recruit 170,000 workers in the Netherlands, but only 54,000 men registered. Most Dutch men did not want to work for the enemy. Many of them went into hiding, others arranged documents proving that they were incapacitated for work, or could not be missed at home or at work.\n\nThe Germans turned up the heat by increasing the target group to include all men aged 17 to 40 and by holding raids. Any man walking in the street was liable to be arrested and taken to Germany. The Germans eventually succeeded in deploying a quarter of a million Dutch men.\n\nThe most notorious raid took place in Rotterdam. On 10 and 11 November 1944, 52,000 men were arrested throughout the city.\n\nWork in Germany was often hard. The food was bad and the workers were treated poorly. It was dangerous, too, because the Allies were bombing the factories in order to disrupt the German war production. Still, some of the men did not have a hard time, and they enjoyed the freedom of being away from home.\n\nMany retaliatory actions were not coordinated or approved by the authorities. Some people used the events to settle personal scores. Resistance fighters were sometimes accused of collaboration because they had been in contact with the Germans in order to obtain information.\n\nA total of approximately 120,000 NSB members and collaborators were arrested. Before long, the prisons and police stations were overcrowded, and the detainees were locked up in schools, factories, and sheds. The former concentration camps Westerbork and Vught were also used as prisons.\n\nSome of the arrested people were later tried by the Special Court of Justice, which had been established to deal with crimes committed during the war.\n\nThe Netherlands was occupied by the German army. On Wednesday, 29 May 1940, the army transferred civilian authority to Arthur Seyss-Inquart, and military authority to General Friedrich Christiansen. Seyss-Inquart was a Nazi from Austria. He had played an important role in Austria’s Anschluss to Germany in 1938. Now he became the highest authority in the Netherlands: Reich Commissioner for the Occupied Dutch Territories. He only answered to Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn his speech, he emphasised the friendship between Germany and the Netherlands. The German invasion, he said, was necessary to protect Germany. He paid his respects to the fallen Dutch military and population. He claimed not to want to deprive the Netherlands of its freedom or impose political convictions.\n\nTo obtain their cooperation, he sweet-talked the Dutch, but his tone was to become increasingly harsh over the course of the occupation.\n\nIn the summer of 1941, the Germans rebuilt the camp at Bergen-Belsen that had previously housed French and Belgian prisoners of war. Room had to be found for captured Soviet soldiers because Germany was to attack the Soviet Union on 22 June. Two other prisoner of war camps were constructed in the vicinity of the camp.\n\nBy autumn, more than 20,000 prisoners had already been brought in. They were left to their own devices. There were too few barracks and not enough food. Many of the prisoners had to sleep outside, in pits they had dug themselves. Within a year, over 41,000 Soviet soldiers died because of the poor conditions.\n\nMore than one in two captured Soviet soldiers died in German hands. A total of 3,300,000 Soviet prisoners of war succumbed.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, the SS took over part of the camp. It was turned into an ‘Austauschlager’, a camp for imprisoned Jews who could be exchanged for Germans POWs held abroad. A small group of Jews was eventually released.\n\nSomehow, the Jewish Dutch had to pick up their lives again. This was hard. Many of them were still ill or injured and severely traumatised by their stay in the concentration camps. They had often lost most of their relatives and did not know what had happened to the rest.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the returning Jews were often in for a chilly welcome. Their houses had been demolished or were occupied by other people. Some non-Jewish Dutch people were none too happy that the returned Jews wanted their old jobs or deposited items back. The non-Jewish population was not that interested in the suffering of the Jews, as they had suffered as well, especially during the Hunger Winter. Dutch government authorities even fined returned Jews for unpaid taxes, which they had been unable to pay due to their deportation. It was not until the 1960s that the awareness of the plight of the Jews increased.\n\nIn a POW camp in Attichy, northern France, the Allies tried to re-educate members of the Hitlerjugend. Many of the boys had fought the Allies in the 'Volkssturm' militia during the last months of the war. The German youth called it a 'Baby Lager', a 'baby camp'. About 7.000 12- to 17-year-old boys were taught about democracy and made to renounce their allegiance to Hitler.\n\nSince the war was over, the Allies wanted to eliminate all traces of National Socialism. The process was known as denazification. Germany had been a dictatorship for 12 years and must now become a democracy. The Allies banned Nazi newspapers, books, and films, as well as Nazi organisations such as the SS and the Hitlerjugend. In addition, the Allies launched a newsreel: 'Welt im Film', with items about the reconstruction of Europe.\n\nOn 17 July 1945, the Potsdam Conference started. The three participants were the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, the main Allies. At the conference, they discussed the future of Germany, which had just been defeated.\n\nThe Allies did not want a repeat of the Versailles Peace Treaty. Its heavy demands had been one of the causes of the Nazis’ rise to power. Still, Germany had to change. The Nazi influences had to disappear and Germany had to become a democracy. Germany also had to pay war damages. Some of its factories were dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union.\n\nWith the common enemy defeated, the differences between the Soviet Union and the Western powers surfaced. Both sides had different plans for ‘their’ part of Germany. Stalin wanted a communist regime in Germany, while the Western countries wanted a democratic Germany.\n\nAfter the Federal Republic of Germany was founded by the Western Allies on 23 May 1949, the German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany on 7 October of the same year.\n\nThe trial of Hanns Albin Rauter started on 1 April 1948. After a month, he was sentenced to death, mainly because he had been in charge of the deportation of 110,000 Dutch Jews. He claimed that he had not known that the Jews would be killed, but this was not true. On 25 March 1949, Rauter was shot by a firing squad on the Waalsdorpervlakte, an execution site in the Scheveningen dunes that had also been used by the Germans during the war.\n\nRauter, an Austrian Nazi, had been the highest-ranking SS officer in the Netherlands. As the Generalkommissar für das Sicherheitswesen, he was responsible for public order in the Netherlands. He commanded the police and was responsible for the deportation of the Dutch Jews. Finally, Rauter was closely involved in the fight against the resistance.\n\nGlobke was never a member of the NSDAP. He later claimed to have been in a resistance group and to have ‘prevented worse’ by cooperating on the Racial Laws. This is doubtful, but shortly after the war, he was not convicted. Like many other Nazi officials, former Nazis, and followers, he went to work for the new German government. Germany did, after all, need experienced officials. As a result, Nazi crimes were not always prosecuted. Globke quickly rose in the ranks of the new government. By the time of the trial, he was secretary general to the Chancellor and head of a secret service.\n\nThe GDR’s trial of Globke was a show trial. The East German "
