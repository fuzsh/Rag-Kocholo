Hogan also wore his trademark bandanna in white, along with a silver cross necklace for the occasion.\n\n\"God is doing amazing things at Indian Rocks,\" the church wrote on its Instagram account.\n\nThe professional wrestler has spoken publicly about his Christian beliefs in the past.\n\nHULK HOGAN'S DAUGHTER ADDRESSES WHY SHE MISSED HIS WEDDING TO THIRD WIFE\n\n\"I accepted Christ as my savior at 14yrs old and the training, prayers and vitamins kept me in the game but now that I am one with God, the main event theme of surrender, service and love makes me the Real Main Event that can slam any giant of any size through the power of my Lord and Savior and so it is, even now brother, AMEN!\" Hogan shared on his X account, formerly known as Twitter, in April."
