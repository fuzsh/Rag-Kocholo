Although he gave his life to God at 14, Terry Bolea’s life as Hulk Hogan has not been without controversy, lawsuits and heartache. At one time he was ousted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) but has since been reinstated to their hall of fame. He went through a very difficult time during a divorce and considered committing suicide. However his faith brought him through.

“I’ve leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted Christ as my savior. He died on the Cross and paid for my sins,” he says. “I could have went the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road”.
