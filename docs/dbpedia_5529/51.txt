Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan has announced a significant step in his spiritual journey-getting baptized at the Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida.

The American wrestler shared the news on social media, revealing that the ceremony involved a special immersion at the church.

Accompanied by his wife, Sky Daily Hogan, the wrestling icon fully submerged himself in a large body of water, capturing the moment in a video posted on his Instagram account.

Both clad in white, with Hogan donning his trademark bandana and a silver cross necklace, the couple smiled as they embraced this symbolic ritual.

In the Instagram post, Hogan declared the day as "the greatest day of my life," expressing his commitment to surrender and dedicate his life to Jesus Christ.

He concluded his heartfelt message with a powerful sentiment, saying, "No worries, no hate, no judgment...only love."

Hulk Hogan was rumored to be interested in Scientology

This move towards faith comes as Hogan, now in his 70s, shifts his focus to something he had long preached to his fans-religion.

Throughout his illustrious public career, Hogan has been a wrestling star, movie icon, WWE Hall of Famer, and faced a brief period of controversy in the 2010s.

Now, in a new chapter of his life, he embraces his Christian beliefs more openly.

2023 has been a year of religious exploration for Hogan, who was previously linked to Scientology earlier in the year.

The exact reasons behind this shift remain unclear, with speculation that Hogan's flirtation with Scientology may have involved pressure from its members.

"God is doing amazing things at Indian Rocks," the church noted on its Instagram account, acknowledging Hogan's baptism.

This isn't the first time Hogan has publicly spoken about his Christian faith.
