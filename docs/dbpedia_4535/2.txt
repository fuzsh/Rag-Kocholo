Lyrics

COME AND CLAP YOUR HOLY HANDS

LIFT YOUR VOICE IN SONG

PRAISE THE ONE WHO SAVED YOUR SOUL

COME AND SING ALONG

SING YOUR PRAISE TO JESUS

HIS RETURN IS VERY SOON

IT MIGHT BE MORNING, NIGHT, OR NOON

WHEN WE'RE AT A FOOTBALL GAME

WE SHOUT A HUGE HURRAH

WHEN THE HOME TEAM SCORES ATHE WINNING GOAL

YET WHEN THE SAVIOUR BLED AND DIED

AND HUNG UPON THE TREE

SCARCE WERE THE CHEERS FROM HIS BRIDE

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE LORD

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE KING

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR OUR SAVIOUR, LORD, AND KING

CAN I GET A WITNESS WHILE I SING

WHEN A SINGER BELTS IT OUT A SONG

THAT MEETS WITH APPROVAL FROM THE CROWD

FOLKS WILL CLAP AND SING ALONG

THE WORDS THAT HE SINGS

CAN'T WE DO THE SAME FOR THE LORD

THE LORD CAME TO EARTH WITH A SONG

HOPING THAT FOLKS WOULD SING ALONG

BUT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND

AND THEY WOULD NOT CLAP THEIR HANDS

THEY TRIED TO BURY HIM INI THE GROUND

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE LORD

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE KING

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR OUR SAVIOUR, LORD, AND KING

CAN I GET A WITNESS WHILE I SING

WON'T YOU STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE LORD

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE KING

WON'T YOU STAND UP AND CHEER FOR OUR SAVIOUR, LORD, AND KING

CAN I GET A WITNESS WHILE I SING

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR OUR SAVIOUR, LORD, AND KING

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE KING

STAND UP AND CHEER FOR THE KING, OF KINGS
