Black and white Cheer up everything is fine Darling look into my eyes and I’ll try to think up something nice Said are you gonna cry? “No, I’m fine” She tears up and lets the water slide down passed her breast onto her thigh While I try to think up something nice\n\n7.\n\nSad Boy Freestyle 03:30\n\nI’m sad You were the best friend that I had And now you’re gone and all is drab Now you’re gone and all is bad But we’ll meet again I’m not sure how or why or when Not sure as frenemies or friends But I am sure we’ll meet again In the moonlight Damn This stupid place is all I am Where the great beer’s made by the working man Where the fears maintained with a shaking hand Get out while you can And if you can my baby run Cus in the city with all these churches You can see what god has done In the moonlight You wait to see the man and when you finally shake his hand you’ll ask him “How do you do?” He’ll show you around his place and when you see his master plan you’ll ask him “How could you do this to me?” Cheer up, fuck up Get up, drink up, eat up or shut up You’re too young to die you, you don't try and you give up You’re so down you don’t even know what is up\n\n8.\n\nOur New Deal 05:20\n\nYou and I we have lost the will to fly In the land of milk and pie we’re down about it And I can try to turn water into sprite, but if the ice is going to melt either way then why should I Was in your place when you said you needed space I can see by the look on your face you thought about it Said I can change but you were not entertained So we walked home in the rain and cried about I won’t see you 'til I need to that was our new deal Dot the “i”s We have lost our fucking minds All the things holding us down have come untied Future of mine, it is ugly and unkind All the music’s dead but we are still alive I won’t see you 'til I need to that was our new deal And if I can’t see you when I need to who will help me deal You and I we can give it another try I can grab some food if you can grab some wine Perhaps this time a joke will get us through the night And I won’t cry because you start to cry\n\n9.\n\nJD & Me 02:26\n\nChubby little second grade pre-teen in school on the north side of Milwaukee fifth graders found me ripe to tease fifth graders found me easy Called me over to the evergreen they said they had to warn me secretly Jeffrey Dahmer lives right down the street Told me I was just plump enough to eat Now I’m terrified Jeffery will come and get me Terrified Jeffrey’s a little hungry Get off the school bus I’m all alone Open the door but there’s no one home I rush to turn on every light we own Scared to have the meat sucked from my bones I asked my mom if Jeff was real She said “no honey, cheer up, you ain’t no meal” But that didn’t chase off all my fears Cuz hey here’s me after all these years I’m terrified Jeffrey will come and get me Terrified Jeffrey’s a little hungry for me\n\n10.\n\nAmputee 02:21\n\nJust because I said I would doesn't mean I really will Just because your touch feels good doesn't mean it always will I don’t know where this comes from I just know I want it gone Thinking of an older time I was yours and you were mine In hindsight everything was fine but I guess hindsight can lie Darling wake up He’s gonna make a fool of you Oh wake up No matter what he says to you He’s gonna send you back to me And you can take a piece I’ll be your amputee\n\n11.\n\nCheer Up 04:29"
