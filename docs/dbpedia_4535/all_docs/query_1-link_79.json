        "text": "The spirit of the Y lives on in BYU’s school songs.\n\nBYU fans have been singing the praises of the university for more than a century, thanks to the efforts of a teenage student who used her poetry skills to compose “The College Song” in 1899. Another student gave BYU a reason to cheer with a rousing fight song.\n\n“Both songs have enjoyed a rich heritage at BYU,” says Linda M. Palmer (BS ’71), executive director of the BYU Alumni Association. “The song we refer to as ‘The Cougar Song’ and sing at our athletic events no doubt has a permanent place in the hearts of our alumni. Although less familiar to today’s student body, our Emeriti Alumni Association sings ‘The College Song’ with vigor and enthusiasm at all its events. Both are deeply rooted in the university’s history.”\n\nAnnie Pike Greenwood’s (BS 1900) “College Song” emerged in response to the growing popularity of college songs nationwide at the end of the 19th century. Several attempts were made to compose BYU’s official alma mater song before Greenwood penned the words “All hail, the college that we love.”\n\nGreenwood later became a well-known author and poet. As a schoolteacher she wrote several books and contributed to local and national publications. In 1925 she was honored with the Alumni Association’s Distinguished Service Award. She died in 1956.\n\nClyde D. Sandgren (BS ’37) wrote the words and music to “The Cougar Song,” which has become the anthem of BYU sports and one of the greatest BYU traditions. He wrote the song in the 1930s and later added a special dedication: “To all BYU students who so valiantly served their country in World War II.”\n\nToday the fight song can be heard throughout Utah Valley after each touchdown and field goal at football games. Sandgren also wrote many other songs, including “The Old Y Bell,” sung at the original dedication of the Victory Bell on upper campus. Later, Sandgren served at BYU as general counsel, as a vice president, and for four years as the Alumni Association president. He died in 1989.\n\nTHE COLLEGE SONG\n\nAll hail the college that we love,\n\nAt the throne, the throne of wisdom’s sway,\n\nOh, let us lift our songs above\n\nThe thronging multitude today.\n\nNo pride nor riches here may sue:\n\nThe head, the heart, the hand\n\nUnited must be true—\n\nBe true to thee, our white and blue,\n\nWhen they join our happy band.\n\nChorus:\n\nThen cheer anew for the BYU\n\nWe’ve come to work, to live, to do;\n\nWe’ll raise our standard—bear it through;\n\nOur hearts are true to the BYU\n\nNo college emblem half so sweet\n\nAs our colors, colors pure and true,\n\nNo college banner that we greet,\n\nLike thee, our dear old white and blue.\n\nNo youth its beauty e’er denies;\n\nSuch thought no maid allows,\n\nFor blue is in her eyes,\n\nFor blue is in her bonnie eyes,\n\nAnd of white her thoughtful brow.\n\nChorus\n\nCopyright © 1927 Brigham Young University\n\nTHE COUGAR SONG\n\nRise, all loyal Cougars and hurl your\n\nchallenge to the foe.\n\nWe will fight, day or night, rain or snow.\n\nLoyal, strong, and true\n\nWear the white and blue.\n\nWhile we sing, get set to spring.\n\nCome on, Cougars, it’s up to you. Oh!\n\nChorus:\n\nRise and shout, the Cougars are out\n\nAlong the trail to fame and glory.\n\nRise and shout, our cheers will ring out\n\nAs you unfold your vict’ry story.\n\nOn you go to vanquish the foe\n\nFor Alma Mater’s sons and daughters.\n\nAs we join in song in praise of you our\n\nfaith is strong.\n\nWe’ll raise our colors high in the blue\n\nAnd cheer our Cougars of BYU.\n\nCopyright © 1947 Clyde D. Sandgren Jr."
