do miracles, just you wait and see\n\nBelieve me\n\nIt's not far to never-never land, no reason to pretend\n\nAnd if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again\n\nOh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see\n\nBelieve me\n\nSailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could b\n\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\n\nAnd soon I will be free\n\nFantasy, it gets the best of me\n\nWhen I'm sailing\n\nAll caught up in the reverie, every word is a symphony\n\nWon't you believe me?\n\nSailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be\n\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\n\nAnd soon I will be free\n\nWell it's not far back to sanity, at least it's not for me\n\nAnd if the wind is right you can sail away and find serenity\n\nOh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see\n\nReally, believe me\n\nSailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be\n\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\n\nAnd soon I will be free.\n\nBack to top\n\nSailing — Rod Stewart\n\nI am sailing, I am sailing\n\nHome again 'cross the sea\n\nI am sailing, stormy waters\n\nTo be near you, to be free\n\nI am flying, I am flying\n\nLike a bird 'cross the sky\n\nI am flying, passing high clouds\n\nTo be with you, to be free\n\nCan you hear me, can you hear me\n\nThrough the dark night, far away\n\nI am dying, forever trying\n\nTo be with you, who can say\n\nCan you hear me, can you hear me\n\nThrough the dark night far away\n\nI am dying, forever crying\n\nTo be with you, who can say\n\nWe are sailing, we are sailing\n\nHome again 'cross the sea\n\nWe are sailing stormy waters\n\nTo be near you, to be free\n\nOh Lord, to be near you, to be free\n\nOh (my) Lord, to be near you, to be free\n\nOh Lord\n\nOh Lord, to be near you, to be free\n\nOh (my) Lord, to be near you, to be free\n\nOh Lord.\n\nBack to top\n\nSaucy Sailor – Steeleye Span\n\nCome me own one, come me fair one\n\ncome now unto me\n\nCould you fancy a poor sailor lad\n\nwho has just come from sea\n\nYou are ragged love and you're dirty love\n\nAnd your clothes smell much of tar\n\nSo be gone you saucy sailor lad\n\nso be gone you Jack Tar\n\nIf I am ragged love and I'm dirty love\n\nand me clothes smell much of tar\n\nI have silver in me pocket love, and gold in great store\n\nAnd then when she heard him say say\n\non her bended knee she fell\n\nI will marry my dear Henry, for I love a sailor lad so well\n\nDo you think that I am foolish love\n\ndo you think that I am mad\n\nFor to wed with a poor country girl\n\nwhere no fortune's to be had\n\nI

out\n\nShut up\n\nPow!\n\nBack to top\n\nOnly the Ocean — Jack Johnson\n\nAfter all this time after all these seasons\n\nAfter your one decision to go to the water for reason\n\nNow it's only the ocean and you\n\nAnd all these lines will all be erased soon\n\nThey go out with the tide\n\nThen come back with the waves\n\nIt's only the ocean and you\n\nYou don't want you don't wait\n\nYou don't love but you don't hate\n\nYou just roll over me and you pull me in\n\nWhen this work is done and this coat is dry\n\nWhen this world is too much, it will be\n\nOnly the ocean and me\n\nWhen these sails go up, mountains fade away\n\nStars come out, I'm finally free\n\nIt's only the ocean and me\n\nYou don't want, you don't wait\n\nYou don't love, but you don't hate\n\nYou just roll over me and you pull me in\n\nAnd you pull me in\n\nYou don't want, you don't wait\n\nYou don't love, but you don't hate\n\nYou just roll over me and you pull me in\n\nAnd you pull me in\n\nYou just roll over me and you pull me in!\n\nBack to top"
