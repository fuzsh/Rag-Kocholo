        "text": "Here's The Scoop.\n\nWe are born from cheerleading, music production, and software (lots of it!). This combination gives us the ability to create a unique approach to cheer music production, particularly the ability for coaches to build their own music without having prior knowledge about music editing or licensing.\n\nThe problem we unanimously saw was that cheer music was not matching the performance happening on stage. We were watching an exciting routine but listening to radio remixes. It didn't make sense to us; the industry should have its own type of music that fits the unique qualities of a cheer routine.\n\nSince 2010, we've built an unusually diverse team of producers, editors and software developers (and customer service reps!). We built the resources to create any song or sound we need, and we built the system to distribute it. Now, we can finally merge our ideas into your choreography.\n\nOur build-your-own-mix platform, 8CountMixer, is the worlds' only online cheer mix builder, and it's chock-full of millions of dollars of cheer remixes. Our best work is in your pocket, so just pull out your phone and try out 8CountMixer for FREE! It's the only platform that allows you to instantly hear your cheer mix edits from your phone!\n\nThere's the whole copyright compliance thing, too, but we won't bore you with those details. We're honored and excited to be the first USA Cheer Preferred Music Vendors, and hold the title of Official Music Provider of the USASF!"
