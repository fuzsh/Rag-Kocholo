        "text": "The USA CHEER has developed an educational initiative to provide music producers, coaches and professional members and athletes and spirit leaders with the information needed to help all groups understand U.S. copyright laws regarding music usage as part of performances, routines, competitions, school events, camps,\n\netc. These laws were designed to protect artists, promote creativity and ensure that artists are compensated for their creations. Our educational initiative was developed out of respect for all artists and to protect our members and all those involved in routines, competitions and performances of any kind in which music is used.\n\nThe information provided here is meant to provide awareness of and education about music copyright law. However, this information and our music guidelines should not be construed as legal advice. If you have specific questions or concerns related to copyright laws, we encourage you to speak with a music or copyright attorney.\n\nAll recordings mixed together in cheer and dance routines should be properly licensed and written confirmation of such license should be available upon request. You can use recordings that you purchase from providers who provide written confirmation of proper licensing or original compositions created or commissioned by you (i.e. an original song and recording to which you own or license the rights by written agreement). Under U.S. copyright law, no teams are permitted to create a re-mix, mash-up or medley without proper written authorization from the copyright owners.\n\nHowever, if teams and coaches wish to only use a single song in their routine, they may bring a legally purchased (from iTunes, Amazon, etc.) copy of that recording to be used at the applicable event. Teams may not re-mix these recordings in any way (such as adding sound effects, changing tempo or mixing with any other recordings), but you may make minor edits for timing purposes only (for example, removing a chorus or bridge to fit the duration of the team’s performance).\n\nRemember:\n\nDo not use mash-ups, either created by you or sold by music providers using music without proper licensing.\n\nDo not download songs from sites that do not have properly licensed music.\n\nDo not copy or distribute to others a recording you have legally purchased.\n\nLicenses/Permissions must be in writing (or via e-mail) and must be from all copyright owners.\n\nIf you request a license and you get no response, this does NOT mean you have permission.\n\nCopyright protection is granted to the authors of any “original works of authorship” including musical and other\n\ncreative works. Under U.S. copyright law, a “bundle of rights” is granted exclusively to each artist/creator for\n\ntheir work. This bundle of rights includes the right to copy, distribute, publicly perform, set choreography, and make modifications\n\nsuch as remixes or mash-ups to their work. Only the copyright owners or those authorized by the copyright\n\nowners may exercise these rights. Anyone who exercises any of these rights in a musical composition, sound\n\nrecording or both without written permission from ALL applicable copyright owners is in violation of U.S.\n\ncopyright law. Each violation can incur up to a $150,000 penalty per use.\n\nUS Copyright laws apply any time music is not being used for personal use. Purchasing a legal copy of a song\n\n(e.g., Apple, CD, Amazon download, etc.) only grants the user private, personal use of the music. Personal use\n\nis purchasing a legal copy of a song (e.g., iTunes, CD, Amazon download, etc.) which only grants the user private,\n\npersonal use of the music. If you purchase a recording, that alone does not give you the right to make additional\n\ncopies or mix the recording with other recordings for any other purpose—including use at school functions or\n\nother public performances. Personal use gives you the right to listen to the song, but does not give you any\n\nother rights in the bundle of rights to that piece of music, which is why the music should not be copied, modified\n\n(such as a remix or mashup) or used in a public place without additional consent.\n\nThe band director and principal on school letterhead. They need to grant the right to put choreography to the music, make copies of the music, perform a routine in public, and grant the event producer the ability to play the music in a venue. In addition, if the routine is to be streamed or broadcast, they need to grant the broadcast rights.\n\nThis only applies to original fight song music. If the music is actually from someone else, which is often the case with school fight songs, then rights must also be acquired from the owners of the original work.\n\nYou will need to work with your coach and teams to use music that does not violate US copyright laws. You and your team can also create/compose your own music, or work with a group that creates and composes original music meaning that such group would own the recording, composition and all related rights for that piece of music. If you choose either of those options, the group who created/composed the music must license or assign to you all necessary rights and provide you with documentation that can be shared with the event producer. You can also buy songs from individual musicians who compose original content and assign you any necessary rights to use the music.\n\nMusic providers generally allow a team to make a certain number of copies of the recordings for this purpose. This should be detailed in your agreement with your music provider.\n\nA mechanical license fee may need to be paid to reproduce copyrighted musical compositions on CDs, records, downloads, etc. If the music provider does not own or control the underlying musical composition, they will need to obtain a mechanical license to make copies of each recording. The number of copies needed should be discussed and agreed to in writing. The music provider is responsible for obtaining the mechanical license and paying any royalties for each copy made – this includes the copy provided upon your initial purchase of the recording, any subsequent recordings in which they are incorporated, and any additional copies that will be distributed to cheer team members or coaches."
