        "text": "Lastly I made a Moving On Playlist because I needed this to pump me up to remind me that one day I would move on, and when that day came I used this playlist to remind me of how far I had come.\n\nMore recently I made a Cheer Me Up Playlist because I started realizing how hard it is to find songs that don’t talk about love. So this playlist is made up of happy songs that don’t involve love to give you a welcome distraction and dance party to cheer yourself up.\n\nSo today I wanted to share my playlists with you. I’ve linked the playlists to Spotify but if you don’t used Spotify I’ve also listed out the entire playlists as well. However, I do add to these playlists on Spotify so it’s always best to get them on there. You can access these on a free Spotify account.\n\nWhat I would recommend is using my playlists as a starter and adding your own songs as time goes on. Especially for the cry playlist a lot of these were personal to me and songs that reminded me of my ex or that were out around the time of my break up so they might not stir the same emotions up for you as they did for me.\n\nListen to my Cheer Me Up Playlist on Spotify\n\nListen to my Cry Playlist on Spotify\n\nListen to my F#!K You Playlist on Spotify\n\nListen to my Moving On Playlist on
