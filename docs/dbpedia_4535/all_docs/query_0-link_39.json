        "text": "Last May I published a piece I called SAYS WHO?. In it, I asked questions about fame and reputation. Who makes the stars? Who gives out the gigs? Who decides who is worthy of attention? It wasn’t about conspiracy theory, the Jazz Illuminati deciding who shall prosper and who shall go into retail, but the questions continue to trouble me.\n\nTonight’s example is trombonist Vernon Brown (1907-79) who played and recorded regularly with Benny Goodman for twenty-one years, also with Harry James, Sidney Bechet, Jean Goldkette, Artie Shaw, Muggsy Spanier, Eddie Condon, Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett (who is behind him in the photograph below) Billy Taylor, Lee Wiley, Martha Tilton, Hank D’Amico, Bud Freeman, Sidney Catlett, Connee Boswell, Paul Whiteman, Wingy Manone, Cozy Cole, Bing Crosby, Jerry Jerome, Yank Lawson, Billy Butterfield, and other luminaries.\n\nHe never had a recording session under his own name; he may never have “placed high in the polls,” but he surely could play.\n\nBecause it was Brown’s birthday a few days ago, one of the Facebook sites that celebrate such occasions posted a summary of his career. I think it was factually accurate, although the nameless (although ubiquitous) jazz journalist summed up Brown’s work in a few choice phrases. He was “a journeyman but a reliable musician.” He was “never a major star but was considered quite valuable in sections of big bands and for occasional solos.”\n\nI was annoyed by the posthumous assessment. It’s a grudging two-star review.\n\nAnd then I looked at Brown’s discography: Benny Goodman, never known for keeping inferior players in his band, made Vernon Brown a regular member of his trombone section for twenty years, from 1937 to 1958.\n\nSomething else happened. When you’ve been listening to music as long and as intently as I have, there is a nicely maintained mental jukebox that finds the relevant selection, drops the needle, and whether I want it to or not, begins to play.\n\nWhat I began to hear was Vernon’s solo on ONE O’CLOCK JUMP, by the Goodman band on January 16, 1938, at a little place called Carnegie Hall. You’ll hear Jess Stacy, Babe Russin (or is it Vido Musso?), Vernon, Benny, Jess again, and Harry James:\n\nI first heard that record in the second half of the 1960s, and I can hum Vernon’s solo to you today. It is honest swinging blues playing, in the tradition but completely recognizable and personal. Had it been performed by someone with a higher ranking in the mythology of jazz: let’s say Vernon had had dramatic personal troubles, had died young, had suffered any of the various maladies that affected jazz musicians, we might be holding this solo up as if it were a jewel, to be revered.\n\nBut he seems to have been undramatically professional, someone who showed up to the gig, read the charts, didn’t fall off he stand, didn’t go to jail. There are no good Vernon Brown stories.\n\nHere he is alongside Sidney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, James P. Johnson, Bernard Addison, and in 1947:\n\nand in 1945, with Bud Freeman, Charlie Shavers, Dave Tough, Edmond Hall (although he’s mis-credited on the label, a rare Keynote error:\n\nI am sure that my readers can come up with other, perhaps even more memorable examples of Vernon Brown soloing. My point here is not to assemble his greatest solos or even go through his discography. But the dead cannot speak for themselves, and they should be safe from carping assessments. A musician who played so well and for so long is no “journeyman.”\n\nNot everyone is equal and not every musician is “the GOAT,” a deplorable phrase and acronym. But everyone deserves respect in generous measure. ”Be nice to the dead. Someday you’ll be dead too.”"
