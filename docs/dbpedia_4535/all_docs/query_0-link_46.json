        "text": "On the Battlefield\n\nMusicians who played official roles in the military can be divided into two categories: field musicians and members of military bands.\n\nPlaying in the Field\n\nField musicians included the fife-and-drum corps with the marching units and the buglers that accompanied both the cavalry and the infantry. These musicians marked the activities of daily wartime life, including wake up, lights-out, roll call, and drills. The music also helped organize the movement of the troops (think marching) and even conveyed combat orders to soldiers, who were trained to recognize these commands.\n\nAlthough the minimum age for enlisting soldiers was 18, boys as young as age 12 were allowed to enlist as musicians. The drum corps thus became an avenue for teenage (and even younger) boys, hungry for adventure, to join the war.\n\nInstruments played by field musicians included:\n\nThe Fife—a high-pitched wooden flute similar to the piccolo\n\nDrums—snare and bass drums that could be strapped to the neck or back to be carried\n\nThe Bugle—similar to the trumpet but without keys or valves—a plus for cavalry musicians riding on horseback who needed to keep one hand on the reins!\n\nListen to all these instruments in the following track of Civil War–era marching music recorded in 1913. You can hear fife melodies alternating with bugle calls, all accompanied by snare and bass drums.\n\n\"On Parade\"\n\nTry It!-- Develop musical signals for daily events in the classroom like roll call, attention, recess, lunch, and the end of the school day. Use voices, whistling, or simple instruments. Add words to the calls to make each melody easier to remember. Take turns issuing the signals. Discuss the ways musical cues could help a large army (think more than 40 classrooms full of people!) with daily activities.\n\nMarching Music\n\nLarger bands performed as commanding officers inspected and addressed the troops; they would also present regular concerts and entertain soldiers in camp. The bands helped maintain morale and reinforce spirit and resolve. Musicians also did whatever was needed—staffed ambulances, tended wounded, and even fought as the war raged on.\n\nMore formal than the fife-and-drum corps, bands were assigned to Army units. Regulations stipulated up to 24 musicians a band; in practice this number varied greatly. Occasionally existing bands enlisted as a group, but typically it became too costly to pay these professional bands as the war went on. Because brass instruments and trained musicians were scarcer in the South than in the North, the Confederate Army included fewer (and smaller) bands than did the Union Army.\n\nMost military bands were dominated by large brass and percussion instrument sections. The bells of the brass instruments, which ordinarily pointed forward or upward, would sometimes be aimed backward so that they could be heard better by the soldiers marching behind them.\n\nInstruments typically included:\n\nCornets—similar to trumpets\n\nSaxhorns—upright, valved brass instruments of varying sizes and thus pitch ranges (such as soprano, alto, tenor, and bass)\n\nTubas\n\nPercussion—snare and bass drums\n\nWoodwinds— fife, piccolo, and clarinet\n\n... orany other instruments that musicians happened to play\n\nTry It!-- The brass bands usually played upbeat music, including rousing marches, lively dance tunes, and patriotic anthems. To get an idea, listen to this medley of popular military band tunes of the time.\n\n\"Free and Easy\"\n\nIf you are familiar with the sounds of musical instruments, see whether they can identify some of the instruments in “Free and Easy” (you should be able to hear the snare drums, piccolo, and tuba pretty easily).\n\nIn Camp\n\nCamped for the night, soldiers enjoyed precious downtime playing cards, writing letters, and, of course, making music. They used instruments brought from home or crafted while on duty, like fiddles, guitars, fifes, drums, and bones (a rhythm instrument made from animal rib and leg bones). Soldiers who didn’t play instruments joined in singing and dancing.\n\nPublishers supplied the troops on both sides with a variety of songsters—books that included lyrics to dozens of popular songs. Songs soldiers performed and sang ranged from lighthearted jingles to rousing patriotic anthems to tender love songs. Although some songs were specific to one side of the conflict, other songs appealed to both sides. If there were a “Top 40” of Civil War tunes, it would probably include:\n\nIn the North:\n\n\"John Brown's Body\"\n\n\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\"\n\n\"We Are Coming, Father Abraham\"\n\nIn the South:\n\n\"Dixie\"\n\n\"Maryland, My Maryland\"\n\n\"The Bonnie Blue Flag\"\n\n\"Goober Peas\"\n\nIn Both:\n\n\"Kathleen Mavourneen\"\n\n\"Wait for the Wagon\"\n\n\"Lorena\"\n\n\"The Girl I Left Behind Me\"\n\n\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\"\n\n\"Listen to the Mocking Bird\"\n\nMore often than not, for every song that was wildly popular in the North or the South, there existed a version with altered lyrics to please the other side.\n\nCreating and Adapting Songs\n\nSometimes a favorite tune would be repeatedly adapted. Take the religious song “Canaan’s Happy Shore,” which was popular at the time. You may not know it, but you certainly know the refrain: “Glory, Glory, Hallelujah.” If you are thinking “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” you’re right. But first, this tune was adapted for “John Brown’s Body.” As you might guess, the song celebrating the famed abolitionist (though some say the song was created to poke fun at a solider with the same name) was strongly associated with the North.\n\nThe words most commonly sung (by Northerners) were:\n\nJohn Brown’s body lies a-mold’ring in the grave,\n\nJohn Brown’s body lies a-mold’ring in the grave,\n\nJohn Brown’s body lies a-mold’ring in the grave,\n\nHis soul is marching on.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nGlory, glory, hallelujah\n\n\"John Brown's Body\"\n\nWith its brisk tempo and confrontational lyrics, “John Brown’s Body” was a popular tune that Union soldiers sang while marching as well as at camp. Not to let a rousing tune go unanswered, Confederate soldiers sang to the same tune, “John Brown’s a-hanging on a sour apple tree,” to which Yankees retorted “We’ll hang Jeff Davis from a sour apple tree.”\n\nIndividual regiments also employed the tune. The 1st Arkansas Colored Regiment sang (as recorded in the inflection of the time period), “We are fightin’ for de Union, we are fightin’ for de law…As we go marchin’ on.” And these are just the documented versions—there was probably no end to the variants on this flexible (if often morbid) theme. During the war, the tune was adapted into the song we know best today, The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\n\nTry It!-- Have your students work individually or as a class to write new words to the tune of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” You might suggest that they turn it into a school fight song or a classroom cheer. Discuss how flexible the melody is to work with in this way.\n\nExtend the activity! Have the class march (outside) while singing their new words to “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” Help them feel the pulse of the two-count rhythm and step in time with the beat. Discuss how the music helps everyone stay together, and talk about how it feels to be part of a group singing and marching in unison.\n\nComic Relief\n\nMusic also helped bring laughter into a humorless situation. As the war dragged on and people in the South were increasingly cut off from supplies as well as from their farmland, soldiers sometimes survived on boiled peanuts (at the time also known as “goober peas”) as an emergency ration. The following song was a tribute to this humble nourishment (and in fact was published with the composer’s name listed as “P. Nutt”):\n\nSittin’ by the roadside on a summer’s day\n\nChattin’ with my messmates, passing time away,\n\nLying in the shadows, underneath the trees,\n\nGoodness, how delicious, eating goober peas!\n\n(Chorus)\n\nPeas! Peas! Peas! Peas! Eating goober peas!\n\nGoodness, how delicious, eating goober peas!\n\n\"Goober Peas\"\n\nTry It!-- Discuss with your students the full lyrics to “Goober Peas.” Humorous as it is, what does it relate about the difficult conditions experienced by Confederate soldiers as the ar progressed? How do you think this song helped their morale\n\nHolding Out Hope\n\nMany songs had universal themes that appealed to both sides. One of these was “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” (1863). The melody comes from an old Irish tune, “Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye,” that is also about a soldier returning from war (but with injuries so serious that he is hardly recognized). Lyrics to “When Johnny Comes Marching Home,” written by Patrick Gilmore, gave soldiers a heartening vision of a joyful homecoming after a victorious end to the war.\n\nWhen Johnny comes marching home again, Hurrah! Hurrah!\n\nWe’ll give him a hearty welcome then, Hurrah! Hurrah!\n\nThe men will cheer and the boys will shout\n\nThe ladies they will all turn out\n\nAnd we’ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.\n\n\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\"\n\nTry It!--Have students imagine what a soldier might feel as he thinks about returning home to his loved ones. Remind students that more than 600,000 people died during the Civil War, more casualties than any other war in American history. Many who went to war did not come home. Have students listen and read along with (or better, sing) the full lyrics to “When Johnny Comes Marching Home.” Next, ask students to imagine they are soldiers and then write a letter to their children explaining what they like about that song and what they miss most about home.\n\nFreedom’s Songs on the March\n\nFollowing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, African Americans served proudly in the Civil War (though still in segregated regiments), making up about 10 percent of Union forces by the war’s close. Black soldiers brought with them to the war their unique musical traditions, including spirituals, shout songs, and dance music. The music included improvisation and was passed from one person to another through performance, without ever being written down. Unfortunately, without written records, much of this music has been lost.\n\nAmong the songs and fragments that have been saved is this Civil War-era song later recorded by a former slave:\n\nOh where shall we go when de great day comes\n\nAn’ de blowing of de trumpets and de bangins of de drums.\n\nWhen General Sherman comes.\n\nNo more rice and cotton fields\n\nWe will hear no more crying\n\nOld master will be sighing.\n\nNotice the themes of freedom and liberation, very common in the African American spiritual repertoire. As soldiers in the Civil War, African Americans felt they were helping bring themselves and their families ever closer to these goals.\n\nOn the Home Front\n\nAmong civilians, music not only rallied public opinion about the war, but also provided a link between what was happening on the battlefield and what they were experiencing at home. On numerous occasions, songs powerfully united public sentiment behind the war effort.\n\nRallying the Southern Cause\n\nSoon after South Carolina’s secession in 1860, vaudevillian Harry Macarthy penned the lyrics to “The Bonnie Blue Flag.” Set to a traditional Irish tune, the song was performed at public events throughout the South and became a favorite marching song in the Confederate Army as well. Here is an excerpt:\n\nWe are a band of brothers, and native to the soil,\n\nFighting for our Liberty with treasure, blood, and toil;\n\nAnd when our rights were threatened, the cry rose near and far,\n\nHurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag, that bears a Single Star!\n\n(Chorus)\n\nHurrah! Hurrah! For Southern Rights Hurrah!\n\nHurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a Single Star!\n\n\"The Bonnie Blue Flag\"\n\nIts power as a rallying cry made “The Bonnie Blue Flag” particularly repugnant to Northerners—when General Butler occupied New Orleans, he arrested the song’s publisher, destroyed all remaining copies of the song, and threatened to fine anyone caught singing, playing, or even whistling the melody.\n\nThe Northern Battle Cry\n\nYankees had their own flag songs. The most popular of these was “The Battle Cry of Freedom,” written by George Root in 1862 in response to President Abraham Lincoln’s call for 300,000 additional troops. The song helped rally needed men. It also played a role on the battlefield, helping soldiers summon pride and courage in desperate battles.\n\nYes, we’ll rally round the flag, boys,\n\nWe’ll rally once again,\n\nShouting the battle cry of Freedom;\n\nWe will rally from the hillside,\n\nWe’ll gather from the plain,\n\nShouting the battle cry of Freedom.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThe Union forever,\n\nHurrah! Boys, hurrah!\n\nDown with the traitors,\n\nUp with the stars;\n\nWhile we rally round the flag, boys,\n\nRally once again,\n\nShouting the battle cry of Freedom.\n\n\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\"\n\nQuestions, Sorrow\n\nNot all songs of the period glorified the war or the reasons behind it. A number of songs dealt with soldiers’ suffering and that of the loved ones they left behind. Songs even painted a stark portrait of casualties on the battleground. In a war that extracted such a heavy cost—more than 600,000 soldiers lost their lives—there were voices that questioned whether it was all worth it.\n\nThe words for “All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight” came from Ethel Lynn Eliot Beers’s poem “The Picket Guard” (1861). This affecting verse was set to music by several different composers, most memorably by J. H. Hewitt. The song tells the story of a night guardsman who, thinking of his wife and children at home, falls unnoticed to an enemy bullet.\n\n\"All Quiet Along the Potomac Tonight\"\n\nA Lasting Musical Heritage\n\nAgainst the background of the misery and the bloodshed of the American Civil War stands a rich and vibrant body of music, much of which is still familiar to us today. Music drew people into the war, it was put to functional use within the Union and Confederate forces, and it helped soldiers and civilians alike cope with the war’s brutal realities. Through the war’s music, students can explore and experience the rhythms and emotions of a nation facing one of its toughest tests."
