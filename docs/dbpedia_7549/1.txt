The United States Senate confirmed Melissa G. Dalton to be Under Secretary of the Air Force May 23, clearing the way for her to become the Department’s second highest-ranking civilian leader.

President Joe Biden selected Dalton for the post Sept. 21, 2023.

“I’m excited to welcome Melissa to our ‘One Team.’ Her expertise and experience are what we need as we continue our efforts to address the security challenges we face in the defense of our country,” said Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. “Her record of public service is impressive, including deployed duties in Afghanistan. The Department, our Airmen, our Guardians and military families will benefit from her efforts and advocacy.”

The Under Secretary of the Air Force assists the Secretary of the Air Force in managing the Department of the Air Force and organizing, training and equipping the Air Force and Space Force.

The Honorable Kristyn E. Jones, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller, has performed the duties of the Under Secretary of the Air Force since March 2023.

Kendall continued, “I also want to express my gratitude to Kristyn Jones for her dedicated service while serving as Under Secretary. Her leadership and focus was invaluable as we advanced our modernization priorities and efforts to re-optimize the Department for an era of Great Power Competition.”
