        "text": "Houston Community College (HCC) is bolstering its offerings with the introduction of new ROTC and military education programs. Aimed at cultivating future military leaders, the program seeks to instill values of honor, courage and commitment while preparing students for both military service and civilian careers.\n\nUnder the leadership of Robert Glover, executive director for Military Education Programs, HCC will collaborate with Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC organizations and leverage two external organizations: the U.S. Army’s Strategic Officer Recruitment Detachment and the U.S. Navy Talent Acquisition Group.\n\nThe goal is to provide opportunities to about 110,000 high school students in the Houston area. By offering the programs, HCC aims to not only prepare students for success in their military careers but also equip them with the skills and qualities necessary for leadership roles in the military or civilian sectors. Credits earned in the program are fully transferrable to four-year universities.\n\n“This collaboration will pave the way for tailored academic and career pathways and catering to the diverse strengths, interests and career aspirations of students,” said Glover, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel. “This presents our prospective students with the opportunity to gain real-world education and experience.”\n\nThe program prioritizes the development of leadership skills through rigorous training, mentorship and hands-on experiences. The college will establish additional partnerships with relevant organizations to enhance training opportunities while ensuring compliance with U.S. Department of Defense needs.\n\nThe initiative comes at a time when more than 5,700 students in the greater Houston region take part in Junior ROTC programs in various school districts, including Katy ISD, Houston ISD, Fort Bend ISD, Stafford MSD, Alief ISD and Spring Branch ISD.\n\n“We are so delighted this initiative is underway, and we welcome the chance to play an even larger part in the defense of our nation through programs like ROTC,” said Chancellor Margaret Ford Fisher, Ed.D. “In the years ahead, students will learn the leadership skills needed for successful military careers while receiving real-world, affordable education in HCC’s wide range of programs.”\n\nLearn more at https://www.hccs.edu/military-education.\n\n| Next Article »"
