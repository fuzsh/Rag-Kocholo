Bryan and SS Quinault Victory, at Port Chicago, California, two explosions killed 320 men and another 390 were injured.\n\nOf those killed, 202 were stevedores, who loaded and unloaded cargo at docks due to the segregation of African American service members in labor-intensive ratings. Freddie Meeks, an African American Sailor and Port Chicago survivor, recalled the shock as he absorbed the loss of life and the destruction that occurred.\n\nLearn more:\n\nNaval History and Heritage Command: Port Chicago Overview\n\nNaval History and Heritage Command: Port Chicago Lessons Learned\n\nPort Chicago Lesson Plan (Grades 9 â€“ 12)"
