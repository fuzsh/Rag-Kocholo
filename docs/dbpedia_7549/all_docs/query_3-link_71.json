EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FORMS OF ADDRESS\n\nWord Version - A viewer is available from Microsoft® for Word files.\n\nPDF Version - To view PDF files, you can use the Acrobat® Reader®.\n\nExternal forms of address\n\nThe standard addresses are the conventional forms of address in general use. Use them as patterns for other addresses. They may be varied under certain circumstances.\n\n(1) The Honorable may be replaced by a title such as General, Dr., or His Excellency, as appropriate.\n\n(2) Use of The Honorable\n\n(a) All Presidential appointees and Federal- and State-elected officials are addressed as The Honorable.\n\n(b) All Mayors are addressed as The Honorable. However, as a general rule, county and city officials are not addressed as The Honorable.\n\n(c) A person once entitled as Governor, Senator, Judge, General, The Honorable, His Excellency, or similar distinctive title may retain the title throughout his/her lifetime.\n\n(3) The title Madam is used before such formal terms as President, Vice President, Chairman, Secretary, Ambassador, and Minister when the position is occupied by a woman.\n\n(4) Use the title Senator for a female member of the Senate, or Senator-elect and use the title of Congresswoman for a female member of the U. S. House of Representatives, Congresswoman-elect.\n\n(5) If correspondence is received from a foreign government official and it is uncertain how the person should be addressed (The Honorable or His Excellency), contact the FHWA Executive Secretariat for assistance. Another source of information is the Department of State, Executive Secretariat, which may be able to answer the inquiry.\n\nGeneral rules to observe when addressing communications to individuals by name and/or title are as follows.\n\n(1) Spell out all titles in the address except Dr., Mr., and Mrs. Do not use two titles with the same meaning. For example:\n\nDo not use Mr. John Doe, Civil Engineer, or Dr. Paula White, M.D., on the same line.\n\nUse: JOHN DOE, P. E., or PAULA WHITE, MD\n\n(2) If it is not known whether the addressee is a man or woman, use Mr. with the name.\n\n(3) Use Ms. when uncertain whether to use Mrs. or Miss.\n\n(4) Address a person holding a Ph.D. degree as Dr. (Full Name) rather than as The Reverend, Dean, Professor, etc.\n\n(5) Rules for Addressing Children\n\nWhen responding to correspondence obviously from a child, use the following forms:\n\nFemale - Always use Miss Male\n\nAges 1 - 12 Master John Doe\n\nDear John: Ages 12 - 18 John Doe\n\nDear John: Ages 18 + Mr.John Doe\n\nDear Mr. Doe:\n\n(6) When any official has military rank or a doctoral degree, use the proper title instead of Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms.\n\nInternal forms of address\n\nThe following addresses are to be used for correspondence to organizations within DOT.\n\n(1) Standard Addresses for Internal DOT Correspondence.\n\n(2) Standard Addresses for Internal FHWA Correspondence.\n\nThe names of Secretarial Officers, Assistant Secretaries, heads of operating administrations, and heads of lower organizational elements may be obtained from the DOT Telephone Directory at http://hqdirectory.dot.gov/orgselect.cfm?type=org\n\nNames and addresses of FHWA Key Field Personnel (Directors of Field Services, Resource Centers and Division Administrators) may be obtained from the FHWA Key Field Personnel Directory at https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/foisp/keyfield.jsp\n\nNames and addresses of Governors may be obtained from http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.b14a675ba7f89cf9e8ebb856a11010a0\n\nNames and addresses of State departments of transportation may be obtained from http://www.transportation.org/?siteid=37&pageid=332\n\nWhat are the procedures for addressing international mail?

uppercase letters.\n\n(2) The last line of the address block must only include the complete county name (no abbreviations) written in uppercase letters.\n\n(3) An address in a foreign language is permitted if the names of the city province, and country are also indicated in English.\n\n(4) If possible, the address on the envelope should have no more than five lines.\n\n(5) Below are examples

However, the complete address should always be included on the envelope.\n\n[2] The title is Dr., Mr., etc., as appropriate. The title Reverend is not used with the surname alone but may be used with another title; e.g., Reverend Dr. Smith or Rev. Mr. Smith.\n\n[3] See Footnote 1\n\n[4] If the Clerk's name is not known, use only his/her title in the address and Dear M. Clerk: in the salutation.\n\n[5] See Footnote2\n\n[6] If it is not known whether the addressee is a man or a woman, use either the full name such as \"Dear Leslie Doe\" or \"Dear M. Doe.\"\n\n[7] In most States, the lower branch of the legislature is the House of Representative. In some States, such as California and New York, the lower house is known as the Assembly. In others, such as Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, it is known as the House of Delegates. Nebraska has a one-house legislature. Its members are classed as Senators.\n\n[8] Additional ecclesiastical information may be found in The World Almanac and Book of Facts available in the Departmental Library, the GSA Retail Store, and in other publications available from the DOT Library.\n\n[9] There are two classes of Monsignori one (Domestic Prelates) are addressed as The Right Reverend. The other (Papal Chamberlains) are addressed as The Very Reverend. The Official Directory will give the correct designations. In the absence of definite information, it is always courteous to address any Monsignor as The Right Reverend.\n\n[10] In all cases, The Reverend should not be used with a surname only, as The Reverend Smith. To say The Reverend Smith is like saying The Respected Smith. Hence, there must always be an intervening Christian name or initial, or a title such as Dr., Mr., Ms., or Professor between The Reverend and the surname.\n\n[11] The names of the clergy of the Episcopal Church may be found in The Episcopal Church Annual.\n\n[12] The title Reverend is not used in either the Mormon Church or the Seventh-day Adventist. Mr. may be used for any of their ecclesiastical ranks, or preferably Elder for their pastors.\n\n[13] Titles may be used in connection with Dr., except M.D., D.D., or other degree letters that mean Doctor.\n\n[14] These abbreviations do not constitute a complete listing but consist of the most frequently used to serve as a guideline. Appropriate abbreviations may be found in a standard dictionary and other reference books available from the DOT Library and the GSA Retail Store. Reference should also be made to incoming correspondence, if any, for correct degree letters and titles.\n\n[15] In modern usage, women may be addressed by Ms., Mrs., and/or Miss. Married women may assume the name of their husbands or retain the name they had before marriage. In some instances, married couples combine their surnames with a hyphen. In all cases it is the preference of the addressee, when known, that should be followed. Incoming correspondence, if any, should be referenced. For Secretarial correspondence, the Executive Secretariat may be contacted. In the case of local correspondence when such questions arise, a telephone call to the addressee's office may be made to obtain the information. The plural of Ms. is either Mses. Or Mss.\n\n[16] A letter to two or more persons may be addressed as illustrated, or to only one of them when the letter is mentioned by name in the opening paragraph.\n\n[17] When the names of both men and women occur in the inside address, the individual whose name appears first should be addressed first in the salutation.\n\nPrevious: Appendix B - Acronyms Next: Appendix D - Preparation of Reports to Congress\n\nFHWA Home | Directives | Orders | Feedback"
