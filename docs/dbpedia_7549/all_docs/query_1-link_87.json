        "text": "Fact check: Trump falsely claims there was \"just about no inflation\" during his administration\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation virtually did not exist during his presidency – drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation.\n\n“I had 1% inflation. I had actually no inflation because if you look at the categories, we had just about no inflation,” he said at his Mar-a-Lago press conference. “I actually had a positive inflation. It was a perfect number because you don’t want zero … I had a perfect number, right around the 1%.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not 1%.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump’s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump campaign officials project optimism as Harris momentum continues\n\nThe Trump campaign is downplaying the significance of the Democratic Party reshuffling its ticket to elevate Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden, arguing that despite the change in the dynamics of the race, the “fundamentals” of the campaign have remained the same.\n\nTrump campaign officials told reporters on Thursday they believe Harris’ improvement over Biden in public polls can be attributed to “irrational exuberance,” arguing that Harris is making up ground with voters who supported Biden in 2020 but had moved away from Democrats before Harris moved to the top of the ticket.\n\nThe official pushed back on Harris’ attacks on Trump’s presidential record, crystallized in the campaign’s new slogan, “We are not going back,” which Harris and her supporters have latched on to at recent campaign events.\n\n“When you ask voters whether they’d rather return to the Trump economy, or stay with the Biden economy, we win that two to one,” the official said.\n\nThe official said the campaign’s internal data showed Harris has increased enthusiasm among Democratic voters and does better with undecided voters than Biden, but contended she still trails Trump in both voter motivation and popularity with undecided voters. Officials also said Harris was doing better among Black voters then President Joe Biden was, a demographic that Trump’s team has been heavily targeted this cycle.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claimed that he signed the largest tax cut in history\n\nFormer President Donald Trump once again claimed that he signed the largest tax cut in history during his administration.\n\n“Our tax cuts, which are the biggest in history, our tax cuts are coming due as you know very soon,” Trump said in his Thursday news conference.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nThe act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates.\n\nIn a report released in June, the federal government’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger – former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nFact check: Trump tries to distance himself from calls about Hillary Clinton to \"lock her up\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump tried to distance himself from his previous calls to lock up Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election. During a Mar-a-Lago news conference on Thursday, he said that while his supporters “used to say, ‘lock her up, lock her up,’” he wouldn’t echo those calls and instead “would say just, ‘relax, please.’”\n\n“I was very protective of (Clinton). Nobody would understand that, but I was. I think my people understand it. They used to say, ‘lock her up, lock her up,’ but I would say just, ‘relax, please,’” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s suggestion that while his supporters chanted “lock her up,” he merely told them to “relax” is misleading at best. Trump sometimes went silent and paused his remarks as his supporters engaged in the chants, giving them time to continue, but he has used those exact words and similar language on other occasions.\n\nHistorically, Trump used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime.\n\n“For what she’s done, they should lock her up,” Trump said after the crowd chanted “lock her up” at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\n“‘Lock her up’ is right,” he said at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump has also explicitly called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different phrasing.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,” he said in a June 2016 speech in California. “She has to go to jail,” he repeated in an October 2016 speech in Florida. At a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton said, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Trump responded, “Because you’d be in jail.”\n\nTrump softened his rhetoric shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn’t want to hurt her and didn’t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to “lock her up.”\n\n“You should lock her up, I’ll tell you,” he said at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted “lock them up” in relation to the Biden family, Trump said, “You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.”\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims Harris \"couldn’t pass her bar exam\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump repeated his false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris, a lawyer who was elected as San Francisco’s district attorney and then as California’s attorney general, “couldn’t pass her bar exam.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Harris “couldn’t pass her bar exam.” She did fail on her first attempt to pass the bar exam, according to The New York Times, but then succeeded. She was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school.\n\nTrump could fairly say that Harris couldn’t initially pass the bar exam, but his news conference comments made it sound like she never passed.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims that \"nobody was killed on Jan. 6\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump falsely claimed at a Mar-a-Lago news conference Thursday that “nobody was killed on Jan. 6.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true.\n\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Maryland, was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police employee as a mob tried to force its way toward the House Chamber. Three other people died of “medical emergencies” during the riot. In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”\n\nWalz said in 2005 he was ready to serve his nation in \"DC or Iraq\"\n\nGov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice presidential running mate, refused to drop out of his congressional race in 2005 despite an Army National Guard announcement of a possible deployment, according to a statement from his campaign at the time.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz’s campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n“I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n“As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,” he said. “I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.”\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It’s unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\n“I left in April of 2005 and for me it was just short of 25 years and it was to run for this office. We were really concerned that we were going to try and do both. There’s always the Hatch Act and some of the things that you have to be very careful of,” Walz said in the interview.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.\n\nAnalysis: Trump stays home, leaving Vance to challenge Harris and Walz for the Midwest\n\nIt was the first big day of the wrestle for the Midwest that is likely to decide the 2024 election, and someone important was missing — former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican nominee left it to his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, to troll the newly minted Democratic ticket through the critical swing state territory Wednesday as a fresh 90-day race for the White House burst into life.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held two high-energy rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan that showed the euphoria inside a once-despairing Democratic Party for its two new candidates.\n\nThe Democratic nominee borrowed a trick from Trump’s playbook, performing a dramatic arrival scene aboard Air Force Two in Michigan that mirrored his past use of the bigger presidential jet before a packed airport rally.\n\nFor the second day in a row, Harris appeared before thousands of excited supporters who spelled out a collective warning sign for Trump — who is known to obsess over crowd sizes. She appeared to be quickly settling into her novel role as her party’s official candidate, displaying flashes of charisma and increasing confidence as her political honeymoon showed no signs of ending.\n\nRead the full analysis."
