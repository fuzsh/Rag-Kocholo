The secretary of the Air Force is a civilian appointed by the president, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.[2] The secretary reports to the secretary of defense and/or the deputy secretary of defense, and is by statute responsible for and has the authority to conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Air Force.[2][3]\n\nThe secretary works closely with their civilian deputy, the under secretary of the Air Force; and their military deputies, the chief of staff of the Air Force and the chief of space operations.\n\nThe first secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, was sworn in on September 18, 1947, upon the split and re-organization of the Department of War and Army Air Forces into an air military department and a military service of its own, with the enactment of the National Security Act.\n\nOn July 26, 2021 the United States Senate confirmed Frank Kendall III as the next Secretary of the Air Force. On July 28, 2021, Kendall was sworn in as the 26th Secretary of the Air Force.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe secretary is the head of the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Air Force is defined as a Military Department.[4] It is not limited to the Washington headquarters staffs, rather it is an entity which includes all the components of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, including their reserve components:\n\nThe term 'department', when used with respect to a military department, means the executive part of the department and all field headquarters, forces, reserve components, installations, activities, and functions under the control or supervision of the Secretary of the department.[5]\n\nThe exclusive responsibilities of the secretary of the Air Force are enumerated in of the United States Code. They include, but are not limited to:\n\n(1) Recruiting.\n\n(2) Organizing.\n\n(3) Supplying.\n\n(4) Equipping (including research and development).\n\n(5) Training.\n\n(6) Servicing.\n\n(7) Mobilizing.\n\n(8) Demobilizing.\n\n(9) Administering (including the morale and welfare of personnel).\n\n(10) Maintaining.\n\n(11) The construction, outfitting, and repair of military equipment.\n\n(12) The construction, maintenance, and repair of buildings, structures, and utilities and the acquisition of real property and interests in real property necessary to carry out the responsibilities specified in this section.[3]\n\nBy direction of the secretary of defense, the secretary of the Air Force assigns military units of the Air Force and Space Force, other than those who carry out the functions listed in , to the Unified and Specified Combatant Commands to perform missions assigned to those commands. Air Force and Space Force units while assigned to Combatant Commands may only be reassigned by authority of the secretary of defense.[6]\n\nHowever, the chain of command for Air Force and Space Force units for other purposes than the operational direction goes from the president to the secretary of defense to the secretary of the Air Force to the commanders of Air Force and Space Force Commands.[7] Air Force and Space Force officers have to report on any matter to the secretary, or the secretary's designate, when requested. The secretary has the authority to detail, prescribe the duties, and to assign Air Force and Space Force service members and civilian employees, and may also change the title of any activity not statutorily designated.[8] The secretary has several responsibilities under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with respect to Air Force and Space Force service members, including the authority to convene general courts martial and to commute sentences.\n\nThe secretary of the Air Force may also be assigned additional responsibilities by the president or the secretary of defense,[9] e.g. the secretary is designated as the \"DoD Executive Agent for Space\", and as such:\n\n... shall develop, coordinate, and integrate plans and programs for space systems and the acquisition of DoD Space Major Defense Acquisition Programs to provide operational space force capabilities to ensure the United States has the space power to achieve its national security objectives.[10][11]\n\nOffice of the Secretary of the Air Force\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice of the Secretary of the Air ForceAgency overviewFormed1947HeadquartersPentagonParent agencyDepartment of the Air Force\n\nThe secretary of the Air Force's principal staff element, the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, has responsibility for acquisition and auditing, comptroller issues (including financial management), inspector general matters, legislative affairs, and public affairs within the Department of the Air Force. The Office of the Secretary of the Air Force is one of the Department of the Air Force's three headquarter staffs at the seat of government, with the others being the Air Staff and the Office of the Chief of Space Operations.\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Air Force is composed of:\n\nUnder Secretary of the Air Force\n\nThe Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs\n\nThe Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space Programs\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and Energy\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration[12]\n\nGeneral Counsel of the Department of the Air Force\n\nInspector General of the Air Force\n\nChief of Legislative Liaison\n\nAdministrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force\n\nAuditor General of the Department of the Air Force\n\nAir Reserve Forces Policy Committee\n\nList of secretaries of the Air Force\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Portrait Secretary of the Air Force Took office Left office Time in office Secretary of Defense President 1Stuart Symington\n\n(1901–1988)September 18, 1947April 24, 1950 2 years, 218 daysJames Vincent Forrestal\n\nLouis A.
