        "text": "Each nominating authority has its own processes and deadlines. Once you determine the categories in which you will seek a nomination, you must contact the appropriate authority to make your request, then follow their application processes to obtain one. Since the process of securing a nomination is lengthy, it is recommended you request them during the spring semester of your junior year or when you are completing your Pre-candidate Questionnaire.\n\nCongressional\n\nEach member of Congress is allowed to have a maximum of five charged cadets attending the Academy at one time. For each cadet vacancy that occurs, the member may nominate up to 15 candidates to be considered for appointment. Vacancies occur when cadets graduate or leave prior to graduation. To request nominations in this category, follow the guidelines in the Congressional Nomination Request Sample Letter.\n\nYou should request a nomination from both of your U.S. senators and your U.S. representative. Because members of Congress want to nominate outstanding individuals from their state or district, they consider academic achievement, leadership performance and athletic participation. While you must be a legal resident of the state or congressional district in which you are applying, it is not necessary to know your member of Congress personally.\n\nBe prepared to identify your place of residence by ZIP Code, state or congressional district. You will then access each member’s website for specific instructions on the nomination application process, including which office to contact and specific deadlines.\n\nIf selected for a congressional nomination, you will likely receive notice from your member of Congress first. After the member has submitted the nomination to the Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy Admissions Office will send you written acknowledgement. Please be patient, as this may occur as late as 30 days after you have been notified by your member of Congress.\n\nContact Information\n\nMost congressional offices prefer you contact them in the spring or summer of the year before you desire to enter the Academy. While some offices will accept requests through the fall, most do not accept requests for nomination after October and may submit their nominations to the Academy as late as January 31.\n\nVice Presidential\n\nThe vice president of the United States may nominate candidates from the nation at large and is allowed to have a maximum of five cadets attending the Academy at one time. For each cadet vacancy that occurs, the vice president may nominate up to 10 candidates to be considered for appointment. Vacancies occur when cadets graduate or leave prior to graduation.\n\nInternational\n\nIf you are a citizen of a country other than the United States, you must be nominated by your country.\n\nNominations from your government are processed through the United States Defense Attaché Office/American embassy serving your country.\n\nNominations must be received by the U.S. Air Force Academy by December 31 for the class entering the following June.\n\nFor more information, see How Can I Prepare?: International Students."
