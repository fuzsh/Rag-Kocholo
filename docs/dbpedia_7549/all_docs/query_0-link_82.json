This is a nine-week course where you will be trained on Air Force legal practice. The JASOC curriculum focuses on many areas of military law, including military justice, trial advocacy and adverse administrative actions involving military members and civilian employees.\n\nThe course also covers a wide range of practice areas critical to daily operations at Air Force installations, including government contracts, environmental law, labor law and legal assistance. Finally, youâ€™ll receive training in international and operations law topics, such as the legal aspects of homeland defense, deployed military justice and civil law, the law of armed conflict and rules of engagement."
