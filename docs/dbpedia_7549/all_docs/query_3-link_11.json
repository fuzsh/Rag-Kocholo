        "text": "CCAF Transcript Request\n\nUnofficial Transcript Request\n\nStudents should check the Air University Student Information System (CAC Required) before submitting a ticket for unofficial transcripts.\n\nOfficial Transcript Request\n\nParchment, a third-party company, handles online ordering. You can order through their site anytime and select from two delivery options. The electronic transcript option costs $3.10, while the first-class mail option costs $5.60. DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY TO CCAF.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The Air and Space Force does not cover these fees. Once your order is approved through Parchment, it is transmitted to CCAF electronically. Our staff verifies the request and uploads a copy of your official AU or CCAF transcript to Parchment's secure site. Parchment then completes the final process of delivering your transcript according to your order.\n\nIf you are experiencing issues after your order is approved through Parchment, please contact Parchment directly at https://www.parchment.com/chat-support/. If you need to include an attachment with your transcript (Nursing, CAS, SOPHAS, CASPA, AMCAS, LSAC, etc.), ensure the attachment is uploaded in Parchment before submitting your order.\n\nOrder transcript through Parchment\n\nSending Transcripts to CCAF\n\nCCAF only accepts official transcripts sent directly from schools to CCAF. CCAF will not accept faxed, unofficial, or transcripts marked \"Issued to Student.\" Additionally, transcripts are NOT accepted from students, counselors, recruiters, or any other third party.\n\nAvoid sending multiple transcripts to CCAF by sending only once upon completion of all desired transfer credits. Additionally, multiple submissions of the same transcript will \"bump\" previously submitted transcripts from your place in our queue.\n\nElectronic transcripts are preferred, and most vendors provide students with delivery receipt at CCAF. Visit your school's website and follow their instructions to send directly to CCAF. Select Community College of the Air Force or ccaf.etranscript@us.af.mil as the recipient. CCAF accepts from these vendors:\n\nJoint Service Transcript\n\nParchment\n\nNational Student Clearinghouse\n\nCCAF discourages but accepts paper transcripts directly from schools. This method is slower, tracking is not available, and CCAF has limited ability to search for lost paper transcripts. The schools should mail paper transcripts to the following address:\n\nCCAF/DRCR\n\n100 South Turner Boulevard\n\nMaxwell AFB, Gunter-Annex, AL 36114-3011\n\nSENDING CLEP/DSST TEST RESULTS TO CCAF\n\nScores for all DANTES-funded CLEP and DSST exams taken by U.S. Air Force members are automatically reported to CCAF. If your CLEP or DSST was self-funded (retests), you will need to request an official transcript by designating CCAF as a recipient when you test or following the instructions at https://www.dantes.mil/transcripts/.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS\n\nCCAF may accept international courses if applicable to your degree program. For transfer consideration, in addition to having your school send an official transcript to CCAF, submit a course-by-course evaluation from a transcript evaluation service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). Follow the instructions on the NACES-member website to have your official transcript translated (if not in English), evaluated, and forwarded to CCAF.\n\nAir University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC)\n\nWHAT IS AU-ABC?\n\nAssociate to Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC) directs DAF members with associate in applied science degrees from the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) to a collection of accredited colleges and universities to consider when completing a four-year degree. The program maximizes the application of military career education and training and provides a multitude of online academic and support services for the enlisted member. For more information, click the link below.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nMaximizes application of military career education and training.\n\nBuilds on the CCAF Associate in Applied Science degree.\n\nIn most cases CCAF graduates will need no more than 60 semester hours to complete the bachelor degree requirements.\n\nEvery student receives a binding degree completion contract that locks in transfer credit and states remaining degree requirements.\n\nAU-ABC partner schools are military friendly.\n\nAU-ABC partner schools are institutionally accredited.\n\nAU-ABC PROGRAM CATEGORIES\n\nCAT I: FOR CCAF GRADUATES\n\nGuarantees CCAF AAS graduates need no more than 60 semester hours to complete an AU-ABC degree program.\n\nCAT II: FOR CCAF AAS STUDENTS\n\nStudents complete up to nine semester hours with partner school to complete CCAF AAS degree through dual tracking -- simultaneously fulfilling the CCAF AAS degree requirements and some of the AUABC degree program requirements.\n\nUpon completion of CCAF AAS degree, students need no more than 60 semester hours to complete an AU-ABC degree program.\n\nCAT III: FOR CCAF AAS GRADUATES\n\nMust complete more than 60 semester hours of credit beyond the CCAF AAS and meet all other AU-ABC degree program requirements.\n\nAU-ABC PARTNER SCHOOLS\n\nEach AU-ABC partner school has gone through an extensive AU-ABC application and vetting process. The partner school determines which CCAF AAS degree or degrees to link to its bachelor degree programs. Students work directly with the AU-ABC partner school to enroll and manage the degree program process. Upon completion of all bachelor degree requirements, the AU-ABC partner school will award the bachelor degree. For up-to-date information on AU-ABC partner schools, visit your local base education office and the Air Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC).\n\nAU-ABC (CAC Required)\n\nGeneral Education Mobile (GEM)\n\nWHAT IS GEM?\n\nGeneral Education Mobile, or GEM, is a partnership between CCAF and partnering regionally accredited civilian schools to provide general education courses that meet CCAF requirements in an online format: anytime, anywhere availability.
