I know he will excel as Adjutant General and ensure our men and women in uniform are ready to support the great state of Arkansas and the entire country.”\n\n“I am profoundly honored and deeply grateful to Governor Sanders for the extraordinary opportunity to join her cabinet and serve as the Secretary of the Military and the 55th Adjutant General of the Arkansas National Guard,” said Colonel Chad Bridges. “As a proud Arkansan, leading the exceptional men and women of the Arkansas National Guard in our mission to serve our state and nation is a lifetime privilege. I acknowledge our servicemembers’ families and employers whose support and sacrifice enable our mission success. We will continue to make the great state of Arkansas proud by upholding the highest standards of service and commitment to our state and nation.”\n\nColonel Chad Bridges Bio:\n\nColonel Bridges enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard in August of 1991 and commissioned in August of 1998.
