        "text": "PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea â€” Adm. Samuel J. Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, led an interagency delegation to Papua New Guinea from July 14-16, 2024, where he met with senior military and government officials and reiterated U.S. commitment to the country through new and sustained initiatives in a whole-of-government approach.\n\nThe delegation of interagency partners included Dr. Mira Rapp-Hooper, Special Assistant to the President and National Security Council Senior Director for East Asia and Oceania; Daniel Krittenbrink, Department of State Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Michael Schiffer, U.S. Agency for International Development Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Asia; and Anka Lee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia, joined by U.S. Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and the Republic of Vanuatu Ann Marie Yastishock, to highlight the strategic partnership between the U.S. and Papua New Guinea based on shared history and values.\n\nDuring the visit, Paparo discussed ways to enhance cooperation and support in the areas of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, health care, military training, law enforcement and energy security, including through exchanges with PNG Defence Forces and sustainable implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.\n\nPaparo met with Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, visited the National Disaster Center, and toured the Leadership Training Center, where he was greeted with a color guard display and met with acting Chief of Defence Force Commodore Philip Polewara. He also spoke with local ministers, governors and officials, including Minister for Information and Communication Technology Timothy Masiu, Minister for Internal Security and Police Peter Tsiamalili Jr., Oro Gov. Gary Juffa, Deputy Gov. for the National Capital District and Motu Koita (MK) Assembly Chairman Dadi Toka Jr, First Secretary of Forestry Kevin Kamus, First Secretary for Central Province Office Patilias Gamato, and MK Councilman Nou Vada to discuss priorities for bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe delegates highlighted the range of ongoing areas of cooperation between the U.S. and Papua New Guinea that both countries discussed at the U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit in 2022 and the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit held at the White House in 2023. The delegation represents the full scope of U.S. efforts in diplomacy, development, and defense, underscoring the progress made to enhance our cooperation with Papua New Guinea and deepen our regional partnerships in the areas of the economy, security, health and energy.\n\nThe U.S. and Papua New Guinea have a shared storied and strategic history, including WWII battles Coral Sea, Milne Bay, the Ghost Mountain Trail (Kappa Kappa Trail) and the Kokoda Trail, where Allies and partners fought together with Papuans. During the visit, Paparo,Yastishock, and USINDOPACOM Command Senior Enlisted Leader Fleet Master Chief David Isom laid a wreath in honor of fallen WWII service members at Port Moresby (Bomana) War Cemetery, which contains the graves of 3,824 Commonwealth service members and a memorial to 750 men of the Australian Army, Papua and New Guinea local forces, the Australian Merchant Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nThe long-term partnership with Papua New Guinea is based on shared values and mutual respect, and the interagency delegation led by Paparo was an integral part of USINDOPACOM efforts to work closely with Pacific partners to advance mutually beneficial relationships that will create more capacity, security and opportunity in the region."
