        "text": "KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N.M.— Gen. David Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force David Flosi visited here Aug. 6.\n\nThe purpose of their visit was to witness the Kirtland mission firsthand and to meet the Kirtland team members who maintain global deterrence.\n\n“It’s been a great day here at Kirtland,” said Allvin. “It’s clear that we have great Airmen here doing the country’s work.”\n\nEngaging with Kirtland not only allowed Allvin and Flosi to connect with Airmen but to also understand Team Kirtland’s unique perspectives and challenges, such as the collaboration of over 108 mission partners across base and a geographically separated unit at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., the 377th Test and Evaluation Group.\n\nOne stop on the tour was the Kirtland Underground Munitions and Maintenance Storage Complex, a facility that represents the primary mission of the host wing at Kirtland. The 898 Munitions Squadron planned and executed the DoD’s busiest Strategic Deterrent shipping schedule in 27 years by moving more than 300 critical capabilities to meet presidential national security objectives.\n\n“Kirtland Air Force Base holds a special place in my Air Force journey—it’s where it began,” said Flosi. “It’s awesome to see the 898th Munitions Squadron continuing their vital work.”\n\nLater, Allvin and Flosi hosted an all-call and question and answer session.\n\nDuring the all-call, the Air Force leaders impressed upon Kirtland the importance of reoptimizing for Great Power Competition, maintaining readiness in a dynamic security landscape, and the importance of collaborating as a team.\n\n“We make sure that when the bad guys decide they want to compete, if they want to do it with their military, they will not do it today -- that’s called deterrence,” said Allvin. “If they make the bad decision, we make them pay for it -- we deter, we defeat.”\n\nAllvin continued to emphasize the importance of preparedness, stating, “There are a few things we’re really focusing on that can take our existing force and make us more ready should something happen, and that’s the way we project power and the way we develop people and capabilities.”\n\nFlosi also stressed his view on preparedness in the face of adversaries.\n\n“We are working on communicating in contested environments because we are facing an adversary in the information domain,” said Flosi. “We need to be smart about what needs to be protected and then apply resources when it’s game changing.”\n\nTo illustrate the team nature of readiness and being a good wingman, Allvin told a story about an Airman who previously pointed out an issue on the general’s uniform.\n\n“We rely on each other. We take care of each other's back and we’re here for the team more so than we are for the individual. Everybody needs a wingman,” said Allvin. “This just reminds me that we are humbled occasionally. It was my mistake but we’ve got wingmen looking out for us.”\n\nAllvin concluded the all-call stating he understands and appreciates Airmen’s sacrifices for the success of the team and fellow wingmen.\n\n“Sacrifice is something you should celebrate because you’re doing it as part of a team that’s doing something purpose filled,” said Allvin. “That’s how we are going to sustain what it means to be an Airman in a time of consequence when threats are lurking and we need to be ready together. It means I am there for my team, I am there for my wingmen, and that’s why I’m an Airman. I’m proud of my sacrifice because I’m serving with some of the best people that the nation and world has to offer.”"
