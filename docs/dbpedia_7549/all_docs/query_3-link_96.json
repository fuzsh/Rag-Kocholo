        "text": "Biden thanks members of former campaign staff as some teared-up, campaign official says\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke to several hundred members of his former Wilmington-based campaign staff at The Queen Theatre Thursday night, thanking them for their support of his presidential bid, a campaign official told pool reporters traveling with the president.\n\nThere were a few tears from some staff members, the official told the pool.\n\nBiden took photos with every person who wanted one.\n\nHarris defends Walz's military service in the face of GOP attacks\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Thursday defended her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service in the face of criticism by Republicans, including GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, who have accused Walz of embellishing his record.\n\n“Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country, and I think that we all should,” Harris told reporters as she prepared to depart Detroit with Walz.\n\nOn Wednesday in Michigan, Vance, also a veteran, accused Walz of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005 and falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone.\n\nSome context: Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006. He retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nIn a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Tim Walz said he left the Army National Guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\nHarris and Walz filmed campaign content in Michigan today\n\nAhead of their event at the United Auto Workers local 900 union hall, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz filmed campaign content for digital platforms, the campaign said.\n\nThe two spent a little over an hour at the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Detroit where they filmed videos. The stop was closed to the press, according to pool reporters traveling with her.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims migrants are being deliberately sent from jails and mental health facilities\n\nIn a news conference Thursday from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, former President Donald Trump repeated his familiar story about how migrants are supposedly arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed by foreign leaders from prisons and mental health facilities.\n\n“Why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums?” he said. “These are institutions that are being emptied out, not in South America, all over the world, including South America, all over the world. Prisons are being emptied out into our country because we have a president that’s the worst president in the history of our country.”\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that jails and mental health facilities around the world are being emptied out so that their inhabitants can travel to the US as migrants. Last year, Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.\n\nRepresentatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.\n\nTrump says he hasn’t campaigned lately because he’s waiting until after DNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he hasn’t been campaigning because he’s “leading by a lot and I’m letting their convention go through,” in response to a question from CNN’s Kristen Holmes at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence Thursday afternoon.\n\nAfter saying Holmes asked a “stupid question,” Trump defended his lack of public events in the past week.\n\nTrump said his Democratic rival Kamala Harris “can’t do a news conference. She doesn’t know how to do a news conference. She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.”\n\nHe promised to travel to campaign more “after their convention,” adding that he’s “going out to certain places to help certain senators get elected, not even for me.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22.\n\nFact check: Trump falsely claims Harris was \"border czar\" under Biden administration\n\nFormer President Donald Trump repeated his claim at a news conference Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris acted as a “border czar” during the Biden administration and that “essentially, she never went to the border” during her time as vice president, discounting her 2021 border visit as one to “a location that was not part of the problem, that was not really going to the border.”\n\nFacts First: Trump repeated two false claims here. First, Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the recurring claim that she “never went” has not been true for more than three years. Second, Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.\n\nVarious news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.\n\nTrump \"hasn't recalibrated strategy at all,\" he says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he “hasn’t recalibrated strategy at all” since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nHe also accused Harris of being “weak on crime” and having “open borders.”\n\n“I think she’s worse than Biden,” Trump said at a Thursday press conference in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nWhy candidates are spending so much time in Wisconsin and Michigan\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday — key states on the path to the presidency.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also held events in both states today, underscoring the importance of reaching voters there. Harris is expected to be back in Michigan tomorrow.\n\nDonald Trump won both of those states eight years ago but they have vexed Republicans ever since.\n\nAlong with Pennsylvania, Trump’s stunning 2016 victories in Michigan and Wisconsin produced a seismic crack in the so-called blue wall of states Democrats had relied on in every election going back to 1992. Trump’s particular success with blue-collar voters gave Republicans optimism for a political realignment that could turn the Rust Belt red for the foreseeable future.\n\nInstead, Republicans have struggled to replicate Trump’s initial success in subsequent elections, including in 2020 when Biden narrowly won all three states en route to victory. Democrats in that time also took over the governors’ offices in Michigan and Wisconsin and flipped a Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 which proved crucial to maintaining control of the chamber.\n\nIn both states, efforts to subvert the 2020 election — including by enlisting fake electors — have also roiled Republican politics, at times aided by Trump.\n\nStill, gone are the days when Democrats could comfortably count on these states to deliver in national elections. Biden won Michigan in 2020 by more than 150,000 votes. The margin was much tighter in Wisconsin, where he came out ahead by about 21,000 votes — a victory of about 0.7 percentage points."
