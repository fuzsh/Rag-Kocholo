Lewis Nkosi (born Dec. 5, 1936, Durban, Natal, S.Af.—died Sept. 5, 2010, Johannesburg) was a South African author, critic, journalist, and broadcaster.

After attending a technical college in Durban for a year, Nkosi worked as a journalist, first in 1955 for the Zulu-English weekly paper Ilanga lase Natal (“Natal Sun”) and then for the Drum magazine and as chief reporter for its Sunday newspaper, the Golden City Post, from 1956 to 1960.

In 1961 Nkosi accepted a fellowship to study journalism at Harvard University, and, consequently, he was exiled from South Africa. From that time Nkosi wrote for American, British, and African periodicals, including The New Yorker. Many of his critical essays were published in Home and Exile (1965), which became a standard source for students of African literature.

The Rhythm of Violence (1964), a drama set in Johannesburg in the early 1960s, handles the theme of race relations. Nkosi produced the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio series “Africa Abroad” from 1962 to 1965 and worked from 1965 to 1968 as literary editor of The New African.
