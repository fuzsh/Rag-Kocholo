        "meta_description": "Thenjiwe Niki Nkosi is a South African-American painter and multi-media artist. Her work investigates power and its structures – political, social, architectural. Implicit in her examination of these structures is an interrogation of the invisible forces that create them, and an imagining of alternatives. She sees her subject choices as monuments to ideologies, referring to her architecture painting as “portraits” and her human portraits as “figures.”\n\nNkosi and Zuckerman discuss the practice of being a parent, making things, going “back” places, the narrative of the return home, the faces on money, the struggle for freedom, doing work that matters, who gets celebrated and why, remembering people aloud, gymnastics and exactness, different definitions of blackness, the tender space of art, the risk of creating art, behavior, movement, and allowing ourselves to be an evolving being!\n***\nThis episode is brought to you by Kelly Klee private insurance .

        "text": "Los-Angeles based artist Diedrick Brackens is best known for his woven tapestries that explore allegory and narrative through the artist’s autobiography, broader themes of African American and queer identity, as well as American history. Brackens employs techniques from West African weaving, quilting from the American South and European tapestry-making to create both abstract and figurative works. Bracken’s work the reasoning beast (2021)—currently installed in OCMA’s exhibition Color is the First Revelation of the World—exemplifies Bracken’s intimate use of color and material, where washed in hues of black, blue, and purple, a figure embraces a goat to soar through the night sky.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss his relationship to craft, weaving, and storytelling, how he starts, breaking rules, why cotton matters, Texas, his titles, abstraction and figuration, and what role hope and empathy play!\n\nLos Angeles-based artist Andrea Bowers has made art that activates for more than 30 years. Bowers works in a variety of mediums, from video to colored pencil to installation art, and explores pressing national and international issues. Her work combines an artistic practice with activism and advocacy, operating as chronicler of contemporary history. A passionate ecofeminist, the symbiotic relationship between women and ecology is a recurring theme in her work, central in Femme Trans-Corporeal Fantasy (Victory to the Goddess) (2023), a monumental work on cardboard that entered OCMA’s collection in 2023.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss her relationship to craft and how it impacts her relationship to activism, feminism, her drawing practice, engaging with the public, what she most values, aging, doing less, And what questions art should be asking!\n\nTony Marsh is an artist and educator who earned his BFA in Ceramic Art at California State University Long Beach in 1978. After graduating he spent three years in Mashiko, Japan at the workshop of Tatsuzo Shimaoka. Marsh completed his MFA at Alfred University in 1988. He teaches in the Ceramic Arts Program at California State University Long Beach where he was the Program Chair for over 20 years. He is currently the first Director of the Center for Contemporary Ceramics at CSULB. He was named a United States Artists Fellow in 2018, an honor awarded to outstanding contributors in American Arts and Letters. His work is the collections of museums across the globe including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY; Museum of Art and Design, NY; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Oakland Museum of Art; Gardiner Museum of Art, Toronto; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; San Jose Museum of Art; ASU Art Museum Tempe; the Foshan Museum of Contemporary Art, Foshan, China; and the Orange County Museum of Art.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss being a teacher, making art, making a real impact, doing things with your whole heart, the influence of his mom, living and training in Japan, things that are encoded with success, how simple things are hard to make, marriage vessels, fertility vessels, and appropriate shapes, suspending time, magic, failure, craft, notions of taste, and taking no out of your vocabulary!\n\nStephen Reily is the Founding Director of Remuseum, an independent research project housed at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which seeks to promote innovation among art museums across the United States. An attorney and entrepreneur, Reily served as Director of the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky from 2017 to 2021 where he invigorated a newly renovated museum with a mission of public service and dramatically increased both contributed revenue and accessibility. Under his leadership, the Speed introduced a new “Speed for All” free family membership for anyone for whom cost is a barrier to entry; initiated its first paid internships; issued its first annual Racial Equity Report, specifying the museum’s standing and commitments on staffing, acquisitions and exhibitions, programming, and more. During his tenure, the Speed worked with Guest Curator Allison Glenn and Community Engagement Strategist Toya Northington to present the exhibition “Promise, Witness, Remembrance,” cited as a model of relevance and innovation as the museum responded in real time to the killing of Breonna Taylor and a year of protests in Louisville. A longtime supporter of museums and the arts, Reily currently serves on the Boards of the Creative Capital Foundation and the American Federation of Arts.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss museums as legacy businesses, the unsustainable nature of the current economic model of museums, innovation, the Director’s role, artists and what we can learn from them, new ideas and initiatives, what’s working, and of course why art matters!\n\nMehak Vieira is the Director and Founder of Jahmek Contemporary Art, a dynamic platform promoting a critical and provocative dialogue about artistic and visual expression in Luanda, Angola. Raised in Luanda, Viera founded the gallery alongside Jardel Vieira in 2018 with the vision of strengthening the artistic infrastructure in Angola for the next generation. Over the past five years, she has worked with emerging and established artists with ties to the country to build an ambitious program of exhibitions, events, fair presentations and more. Her leadership has gained international recognition of Jahmek Contemporary Art, building its reputation as a prominent player in the African contemporary art scene by exhibiting at major events including the Venice Biennale 2024, Art Basel 2022, Art Dubai 2022 and Arco Madrid 2021, among others.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss not coming from an art background, the Angola art scene, being entrepreneurial, why their program matters for the country, elitism, access to information, archiving the narrative, legacy, love, art fairs, how things come together, courage, and why art matters!\n\nBritish sculptor Antony Gormley’s (Sir Antony Mark David Gormley OBE RA) work has been widely exhibited throughout the UK and internationally with recent exhibitions at Musée Rodin, Paris (2023); Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg, Germany (2022); Museum Voorlinden, Wassenaar, Netherlands (2022); National Gallery Singapore, Singapore (2021); Schauwerk Sindelfingen, Germany (2021); Royal Academy of Arts, London (2019); Delos, Greece (2019); Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy (2019); Philadelphia Museum of Art, Pennsylvania (2019); Long Museum, Shanghai (2017); and Forte di Belvedere, Florence, Italy (2015) among others! Some permanent public works include the Angel of the North (Gateshead, UK), Another Place (Crosby Beach, UK), and Inside Australia (Lake Ballard, Western Australia). Gormley was awarded the Turner Prize in 1994, the South Bank Prize for Visual Art in 1999, the Bernhard Heiliger Award for Sculpture in 2007, the Obayashi Prize in 2012 and the Praemium Imperiale in 2013. In 1997 he was made an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) and was made a knight in the New Year’s Honors list in 2014. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, an Honorary Doctor of the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Trinity and Jesus Colleges, Cambridge. Gormley has been a Royal Academician since 2003.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss the state of the world, art as a form of witnessing, what can sculpture do, being in the world but not of it, moving through space with awareness, active meditation, what art is for, recognizing our own vitality, discovering ourselves as strangers, and the urgency and hopefulness of being alive right now!\n\nTess Lukey is co-curator of the inaugural Boston Triennial and Associate Curator of Native American Art at The Trustees of Reservations (The Trustees), the nation’s first and state’s largest land conservation nonprofit. Lukey, an Aquinnah Wampanoag tribal member and lifelong New Englander, previously worked for the Museum of Fine Arts and the Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston, and the John Sommers Gallery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She has also completed fellowships at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, and the Hibben Center for Archaeology Study and the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology in Albuquerque. Lukey is also a traditional potter and basket weaver practicing the techniques of her own Indigenous community.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss reciprocity, pairing artists and experts, how artists can address things in ways that no one else can, teaching people about making, her relation with clay, finger weaving, physically working with a place, being an artist, a maker, and a member, how art needs people, gaining family and realizing who she is, working with the land, guiding museums about respecting tribal sovereignty, her studio visit strategy, magical moments, making ceramics sing, and what can contain all the knowledge in the world!\n\nAmerican artist Charles Gaines’ body of work engages formulas and systems that interrogate relationships between the objective and the subjective realms. In his drawings, works on paper and photographs he investigates how rule-based processes and systems construct the experiences of aesthetics, politics, and language. By employing multi-layered practices, including images, texts, and grids, as well as working in a serial character, Gaines examines image structures while critically questioning forms of representation.\n\nHe recently retired from the CalArts School of Art, where he was on faculty for over 30 years and established a fellowship to provide critical scholarship support for Black students in the M.F.A. program. His work has been the subject of numerous exhibitions in the United States and around the world, most notably at Dia:Beacon, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Studio Museum, Harlem NY, and Hammer Museum, Los Angeles CA. His work has also been presented at the 1975 Whitney Biennial and the Venice Biennale in 2007 and 2015. In addition to his artistic practice, Gaines has published several essays on contemporary art, including Theater of Refusal: Black Art and Mainstream Criticism (University of California, Irvine, 1993) and The New Cosmopolitanism (California State University, Fullerton, 2008). In 2019, Gaines received the 60th Edward MacDowell Medal. He was inducted into the National Academy of Design’s 2020 class of National Academicians and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in May 2022. In 2023, he received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.\n\nHe and I spoke about legacy, continuous learning, creating context and systems, paradoxes of perception, feeling versus intellectual exercises in art, the language of art and what is possible, tantric Buddhist art, chance as a method, philosophy of aesthetics, trees, and AI!\n\nNicholas Baume is the Artistic & Executive Director at Public Art Fund in New York City since 2009. A native of Australia, his career began in Sydney with Kaldor Public Art Projects and later the Museum of Contemporary Art. He was Contemporary Curator at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, before moving to Boston to join the Institute of Contemporary Art as Chief Curator.\n\nHe and I discuss being artist centric, the American museum industry, the moment his eyes opened to contemporary art, how art can catalyze feelings you don’t know you have, creating moments of access, sharing art with the world and serving the public, what defines success, what public art needs, authentic experiences, fundamental values, civic scale projects, the importance of diplomacy, and risk taking!\n\nBjorn Geldhof is Director of the PinchukArtCentre. Founded in September 2006 by businessman and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk, the PinchukArtCentre is an international hub for contemporary art committed to developing the Ukrainian art scene while generating critical public discourse as a whole. Since war broke out in Ukraine in 2022 they have held important exhibitions including When Faith Moves Mountains, a major group exhibition with over 45 artists opening 143 days after the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, focused on Ukraine as a country open to the world and celebrating its deep roots and relation to Europe.

Their collateral Venice Biennale project this year, Daring to Dream in a World of Constant Fear, will be held at the Palazzo Contarini Polignac from April 20th until August 1st, 2024. The exhibition weaves a tapestry of stories and dreams gathered from artists affected by war globally.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss sharing risk, how art saves lives, art not as leisure but also essential part of living life, cultivating a next generation of artists, changing the way people think, the urgency of making art, offering the opportunity to speak, think and feel, knowing that today can be your last day, the urgency of having great thoughts, the role of hope, and the opportunity to dare to dream!\n\nDigital content creator Amanda McCreight specializes in digital storytelling, utilizing photography and filmmaking as her medium to challenge conventional norms, guide discourse, and foster meaningful connections.

Together they craft unforgettable events that leave participants not only with memories, but also with a newfound sense of empowerment. McCreight is a self-described lover, dreamer, and existential thinker dedicated to living the full spectrum of life’s color and emotions in art and in business.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss course correcting your life, saying yes, living a life full of color, finding middle ground, creating brands, giving things your all, flow state, balancing consumption and creation, what we deserve, a vision board coming to life, the first yes, speaking things into existence, public pitching ideas, practicing looking, and why art matters!\n\nSince the early 1990’s, Charles Long has explored the possibilities of sculpture through a rich vocabulary of materials, colors, images and shapes. Incorporating references to art history, popular culture, nature and his own experiences, Long’s work embraces modernist convention as a means of connecting inner and outer realities, forming pathways between one’s mental and bodily experiences and the surrounding environment. Through his many bodies of work over the years, the artist has consistently confronted formal parameters associated with sculpture as obstacles to push beyond, seeing modernism’s trajectory as unfinished and full of possibility.\n\nHe and Zuckerman spoke about metaphysical research, why things are happening, the secret of teaching, refinding art on his own terms, psychedelics, Donald D. Hoffman of UC Irvine, “wisdoms of the masters” and access to pure being, what it’s like to die, what he has to offer, wanting everything he makes to be sacred, not finishing anything, and making art that you don’t have to talk about!\n\nAmerican artist Rodney McMillian’s paintings, sculptures, videos, and performances address the African-American experience while examining race, gender, and class in a broader political context. Aspects of his work negotiates between the body of a political nature and the politic of a bodily nature. McMillian modifies familiar and found objects into new – he offers an alternative reality that reveals how past ideas relate to the present. He is now a professor of sculpture at the School of Arts and Architecture at UCLA. McMillian’s work can be found in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, UCLA Hammer Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, The Orange County Museum of Art, among others.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss the role of chance in his paintings, intimacy and residue, what landscape can mean, issues of class and taste, retitling, existing within uncomfortable contexts, “hitting it on the one,” napping, the physicality of making art, the present moment, working with a voice coach, and the thrill of accomplishing hard things!\n\nArt historian and curator Stephanie Stebich is the Margaret and Terry Stent Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. She was named director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in January 2017. Stebich serves on the Smithsonian’s Capital Board as well as the Smithsonian-London Strategic Advisory Board.

Under her leadership, the museum underwent a major renovation that doubled its exhibition space, and secured major collection gifts, including the Haub Family Collection of Western American Art, 300 masterworks from the 1790s to the present by Charles Bird King, Thomas Moran, Frederick Remington, Georgia O’Keeffe and others. She was assistant director of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts from 2001 to 2004 and assistant director at the Cleveland Museum of Art from 1995 to 2001.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss feeling at home in museums, taking risks, making a museum free, house favorites, why museums buy certain things, finding the optimal location for an artwork, having a broad definition of art to include craft, mentorship, how to get a job, speaking up while active listening, America as a hopeful experiment, artists as makers of hope!\n\nCliff Einstein is the founding partner of Dailey Advertising with a noted history of creating positions for some of the world’s major brands.

Cliff and his late wife, Mandy, have been listed in Art and Antiques “100 Collectors of America,” and they have been featured in a wide range of international publications as noted collectors and patrons of contemporary art.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss his collection of 100 knives, the difference between commercial and fine art, his rules for collecting including meeting the art before you meet the artist, what roles he and Mandy each play in forming their collection, asking people what they like, not to be missed sites to shop for art, what work he bought back after selling it, being philanthropic and what people want back for what they give, his relationship with MoCA and an analysis of the current Los Angeles museum environment, and buying things you don’t instantly like!\n\nMindy Shapero creates lively, meticulous sculptural and canvas works comprised of materials as various as studio scraps, spray paint, gold, copper, and silver leaf. Her works on canvas are formed by stencils sourced from discarded sculptural bits, and portions of those stencils eventually find their way back into the artist‘s sculptural work. In this process, Shapero transmutes negatives from past sculptural pieces into positive shapes that form the bedrock of her cosmic abstractions. Shapero’s repeating motifs—irregular rectangles and ovals that resemble “scars” or ruptures in the surface— are highlighted through the artist’s application of delicate gold leaf, an adornment dating back more than 8,000 years in the canon of art history. She is interested in the combination of old and new techniques. Shapero’s techniques harken back to the artist’s personal history rooted in the DIY aesthetics of punk counterculture.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss her approach to narrative, spirituality, alchemy and transformation, surprising herself, the responsibility of being climate aware, repurposing, being a hoarder, titling as poetry, duality, color as everything, how hard it is to talk about art, the process of making, rules, and making what you want to see!\n\nSotheby's Principal Auctioneer Oliver Barker joined Sotheby’s in 1994 moving to the Contemporary Art department in 2001, rising to Chairman, Sotheby’s Europe, Senior International Specialist in 2016.

Biennials include the Whitney Biennial, Berlin Biennial, and the Lyon Biennial. Solo museum shows include the Whitney Museum at Philip Morris, The Aspen Art Museum, The Brooklyn Art Museum, and the Orange County Art Museum. Tomaselli is known for his intricate, engulfing images of earthly and cosmic realms made by suspending collage and painted imagery as well as an unorthodox array of real-world materials in thick layers of clear, epoxy resin. These works on wood panels mix snippets of botanical, ornithological and anatomical illustrations cut from books and magazines, prescription pills, medicinal herbs and psychoactive plants with the artist’s own designs. Tomaselli sees his mixture of psychedelic imagery and substances as windows into hallucinatory universes: “It is my ultimate aim to seduce and transport the viewer into the space of these pictures while simultaneously revealing the mechanics of that seduction.”\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss a shared love of nature, what art can do, what drugs and birding have in common, the shelf life of art, altering perception and dislocated, settling for oblivion, nocturnal experiences, community, a sample choir, and AI!\n\nTim Griffin is the Executive Director of the Industry. He joined the organization in June 2023 and continues the organization’s commitment to reimagining art’s relationship with its publics.

Lewis creates drawings using graphite, pencil and paper, mediums the artist uses to trace and develop abstract narratives and reflections on the notion of the gestural. By pushing the boundaries of drawing and the possibilities of abstraction, he expands the use of the “material” of language. He currently has a solo exhibition at the Orange County Museum of Art/OCMA.\n\nHe and Zuckerman discuss labor and work, changing the way you think about making art, saying yes, listening to music on repeat, “keep going,” things that exist outside of art, motivational language, caring enough, nicknames, and the precision of human nature!\n\nAmerican curator Lauren Haynes is Director of Curatorial Affairs and Programs at the Queens Museum.

Notable projects include the Paper Dome in Japan, which provided temporary housing after an earthquake, the Cardboard Cathedral in New Zealand, Centre Pompidou-Metz in France, the Japan Pavilion Expo 2000 in Germany, and the Aspen Art Museum. Ban’s architectural practice showcases a harmonious blend of functionality, aesthetics, and environmental consciousness.\n\nBan and Zuckerman discuss humanitarian architecture, using wood, escaping from the influences of our teachers, inside and outside, experience sequencing, looking for problems to solve by design, form finding, not being about style, and humbleness!\n\nSumayya Vally is the founder and principal of Counterspace, a Johannesburg-based architecture and research studio. Counterspace is committed to developing a design language that acknowledges and resonates with the African continent.

Books crowding a coffee table, the remains of a dinner party, and terrains lush with Southern California succulents make frequent appearances in her work; these meticulously arranged interiors and vibrantly rendered exteriors amount to an overarching portrait of the self that identifies objects and locations as signifiers for human characteristics.\n\nShe and Zuckerman spoke about the importance of questions, her use of photographs, how we know and show ourselves, running, active versus passive practice, in between spaces, choice, what she thinks about, and how things come together!\n\nThis episode is a rare, live conversation between Zuckerman and artist Mark Manders recorded as part of an exhibition opening walk through in Los Angeles!\n\nFor more than three decades, Mark Manders has developed an endless self-portrait in the form of sculpture, still life, and architectural plans. Described by the artist as his ongoing “self-portrait as a building,” Manders’ works present mysterious and evocative tableaux that allow viewers to construct their own narrative conclusions and meanings. Initially inspired by an interest in writing and literature, Manders’ first conception of the self-portrait was more literal.\n\nHe and Zuckerman spoke about magic, choosing a single word to describe your life, simultaneity, ways of understanding self and space, truth, freezing time, thinking machines, waiting, and how we understand God!\n\nDerrick Adams is a multi-disciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY.

As a college student, he opened his first gallery in 1972 in Lenox, Massachusetts. In 1978 Deitch received his MBA from Harvard Business School, where he authored his thesis on Andy Warhol as a business artist and sought to find synergy between aesthetics and economics. Such interest led him to Citibank, where he developed the art consultation division, the first professionally organized art advisory service attached to an international financial institution. Deitch has also contributed significantly to art criticism, becoming a regular columnist of Flash Art in 1980 and having his work published in Artforum, Garage, Interview magazine, and Paper magazine. In 1996, Deitch opened the Deitch Projects gallery in Soho, with shows including works from Vanessa Beecroft, Nari Ward, and Mariko Mori.\n\nDeitch has made a resounding impact on the art scene of Southern California.

No Structure.” matters!\n\nAngel Otero is an artist known for employing highly innovative techniques that challenge the parameters of his materials, revealing the intrinsic qualities of paint. His works are rooted in abstract image making and engage with ideas of memory through addressing art history, as well as his own lived experience. Otero is best known for the Oil Skin works he began in 2010, an ongoing series that demonstrates the inherently transformative nature of the artist’s practice as well as his dedication to expanding the visual field of abstract expressionism. The artist’s early childhood memories are brought to the forefront in his most recent series of paintings which see a return to figuration combined with his hallmark style of abstraction. Otero paints and collages dreamlike scenes upon his vibrant structured canvases, depicting objects and spaces that are loosely based on personal memories associated with the domestic sphere. Probing the boundaries of figuration and abstraction, Otero’s most recent works continue to expand the possibilities of painting and materiality.\n\nHe and Zuckerman spoke about the ocean and inspiration, asking questions, personal and intimate subject matter, magical realism, giving space to space, humor as a tool, the energy surrounding his work, trust, the authentic conversation!\n\nWith Episode 106 we have changed a few things up!

Among the earliest practitioners working in video, among the first women to adapt the medium, and the first to focus on TV specifically.\n\nOver the course of her nearly 50-year career, she has created a prescient body of work that in many ways prefigures our current digital realities, where anyone on social media can now “talk back” to media in ways similar to what Birnbaum has done throughout her artistic practice. Her early works from the late 1970s took on American popular culture—Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman being among her most famous—finding homes in exhibitions at nontraditional venues such as hair salons and nightclubs in the East Village.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss joy, awakening to nature, Monet, how art saves lives, being a “video maker,” winning, and spiritual practice.\n\nDan Wood and Amale Andraos, co-founders of WORKac and principals of the firm.

In this position, she recently worked to launch the CIFO-Ars Electronica Awards (in partnership with Ars Electronica) to advance the work of Latin American artists working with new media and technology, an underfunded area of production.\n\nShe and Zuckerman discuss spirituality, humanity, crying in front of works of art, the importance of silence, her legacy, museum decision making, how personal decision making is!!\n\nDr. Salah M.

Taking feathers as her primary medium, MccGwire goes through labour-intensive processes of collecting, sorting and cleaning her materials to create muscular, writhing forms reminiscent of Classical sculpture and creatures from mythology. Through her practice, MccGwire celebrates feathers, which are commonly shed or discarded, as the medium through which she articulates enigmatic anatomies that explore physical and introspective space.\n\nShe and I discuss swimming in the river, unexpected and long term collaborations, the notion of place, tracing the practice of time, being lost, looking again at what you think you know, meditative processes, what she listens to in the studio, flow, flux, patterning and energy, the power of art, and having a weird life!\n\nRoyal Salute, the master of exceptionally aged Scotch whisky, has unveiled a new platform, The Art of Wonder in partnership with celebrated British sculptor, Kate MccGwire. The Art of Wonder will invite some of the most provocative artists of today to take inspiration from the craft of whisky blending to create a lasting tribute to the transformative power of creativity. For its inaugural release, Royal Salute has partnered with British sculptor, Kate MccGwire, who has created three beautifully sculpted and sensuous pieces; Paragon, Plethora, and Protean, under a body of work named Forces of Nature. Paragon is one of 21 bespoke sculptures, that sits with a remarkable 53 Year Old blended Scotch whisky, one of the highest ages ever released by Royal Salute. Plethora, which features sustainably sourced pheasant feathers flowing through the curves of copper repurposed from silent whisky stills, will be unveiled for the first time in Shanghai, China, in November 2022. Protean, the largest installation of the three, continues the theme of Plethora and will be revealed at Frieze, London on the 12th of October 2022.\n\nFor more information, visit royalsalute.com or follow @royalsalute on social media.\n\n@kate_mccgwire\n\nSandra Jackson-Dumont is the Director and CEO of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.
