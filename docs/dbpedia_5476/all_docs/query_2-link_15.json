        "text": "Unwinding in what seems like his garden under grey skies, the controversial media personality shared that his surname is actually Nkosi, not Leope as the industry has come to know him as.\n\nIn a video titled 5 reasons why u should move to South Africa that he published on his YouTube channel, the media personality whose real name is Sbusiso Leope, nonchalantly shared that his biological father’s surname is Nkosi.\n\nNkosi, not Leope\n\n“I’m originally Swati as well, according to my biological father uNkosi, can you believe that. May his soul rest in peace and may Ntate Leope rest in peace, who brought me up…whom I regard as my father,” said the broadcaster from Tembisa.\n\nDJ Sbu goes on to pay homage to Mr Leope, the man who raised him together with his mother, in the video.\n\nHe explains that Leope came into his mother’s life after he was conceived and raised him.\n\n“He basically brought me up after getting married to my moms. When he met my moms, my moms had already had me and he was like ‘no, this is gonna be my boy and I’m gonna bring him up’ and I’ll forever be grateful for the life Ntate Leope gave me,” says Sbu in the video.\n\nWatch DJ Sbu explaining his real surname:\n\nIn the video, the DJ goes on to explain to his audience how financially beneficial it is for people, especially citizens from other African countries, to move to Mzansi.\n\n“Africans are incredible people; your money can go a long way here. Our Ethiopian brothers and sisters love South Africa, our Pakistani brothers and sisters love South Africa because it’s the most amazing, welcoming, warm country,” he says.\n\nALSO READ: ‘I’m not jealous of Prime energy drink,’ insists DJ Sbu\n\nTurning down Umar Johnson\n\nOn Sunday, DJ Sbu published a video where he explains why he wouldn’t be speaking at an upcoming event by US activist, Dr Umar Johnson.\n\nThe outspoken American is expected to be in the country for the Africa Month Celebrations in Soweto.\n\n“We are very excited about having the brother to come and have a chat, and come and liberate some young minds and share his message with our community. I’m a big fan of his work and I’m a big fan of his message,” Sbu starts off the video.\n\nThe former co-owner of TS Records said he didn’t want to do the video, but saw it important to share it for the benefit of upcoming artists and creators who could find themselves in a similar situation.\n\n“I didn’t want to do this video, but I think if I don’t do this video I wouldn’t be doing justice to the upcoming young musicians, DJs, public speakers… who are coming after us who are young,” he shared.\n\n“Obviously as a speaker and somebody who continuously shares his messages on public platforms, I was very honoured and excited,” says Sbu about the invite.\n\n“But when I get to find out that the invite comes with no fee. When we inquire about the fee, the response is that ‘we don’t have a budget for you’ but we will pay you by offering you an interview with Dr Umar. I took that as an insult and I felt disrespected,” said Sbu.\n\nWatch DJ Sbu’s explanation on why he declined Dr Umar Johnson invite:"
