        "text": "Can Themba (born 1924, Pretoria, Transvaal, S.Af.—died 1969, Manzini, Swaziland) was a South African journalist and short-story writer associated with a brilliant group of young South African writers in the 1950s that included Moses Motsisi, Arthur Maimane, Ezekiel Mphahlele, and Lewis Nkosi.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Fort Hare, S.Af., Themba worked as a reporter and later editor on the magazine Drum and the weekly Golden City Post in Johannesburg. His stories won several prizes, including the 1953 Drum Award. His journalistic viewpoint conditioned all his writing. His short stories are anecdotes and vignettes depicting the harsh and depressing conditions of African life in the Johannesburg townships. They have a lively and perceptive wit, but their jaunty tone cannot conceal the self-lacerating cynicism that was required in order to survive under the existing social conditions. Some critics saw his apparent flippancy as evidence of a lack of commitment. Mphahlele even accused him of writing “poor Hollywood imitations.” Nevertheless, Themba’s work has a lively force that illuminates the milieu in which he lived."
