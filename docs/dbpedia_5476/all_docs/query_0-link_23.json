        "text": "Flying Home: Fiction, Critical Perspectives and Homage\n\nISBN 9783905758887\n\nEdited by Astrid Starck-Adler, Dag Henrichsen\n\nPublisher: Basler Afrika Bibliographien, 2021\n\nThis rich volume is dedicated to the astounding South African writer and literary critic Lewis Nkosi (1936–2010). In this book, Nkosi’s celebrated one-act play “The Black Psychiatrist” is published together with its unpublished sequel “Flying Home,” a play on the satirically fictionalized inauguration of Mandela as South African president. Critical appraisals, tributes and recollections by scholars and friends reflect on the beat of his writing and life.\n\nAn ideal volume for those encountering Lewis Nkosi for the first time as well as for those already devoted to his work. Edited by Astrid Starck, a literary scholar, and Dag Henrichsen, a historian."
