        "text": "\"We'll be all right. Something'll happen, someone will come. Something's gonna change.\"\n\nThis article is still under construction. You can help The Enemy Wiki by adding or refining information.\n\nJack is a minor character in the Enemy series, appearing and dying in The Dead. He was the best friend of Ed Carter, and was one of the main protagonists of the novel before his death.\n\nAppearance\n\nJack's most distinguishable feature is his large, dark red birthmark which disfigures one side of his face, which he feels slightly insecure about, especially when meeting Brooke, Courtney and Aleisha. It is not mentioned once in the entire book which side the birthmark is on. Jack describes the birthmark as \"wine-coloured\", while Ed calls it strawberry-coloured, and looking \"like a splash of blood.\" It gives him a permanently angry look. Many people, for example Brooke and her friends, mistake it for a scar.\n\nPersonality\n\nJack is shown to be very caring about his friends and patient, as he waits for Frederique to catch her cat, Dior, and is the last one on the bus. He strongly believes in luck, chance and coincidence, as he explains to Ed about how the people who survive are \"just luckier\". When he loses his temper, he regrets it greatly after, and apologises, although people do not always think he is sincere. ack is self-conscious, and also has a serious inferiority complex, caused by being best friends with the most popular boy in Rowhurst, Ed Carter, and his large birthmark. He can be extremely stubborn and is very brave, risking his life and killing many sickos, as the bus crew call them.\n\nHistory\n\nJack lived in Clapham with his father, mother, and two sisters. Because his father attended Rowhurst when he was a boy, Jack also attended the school.\n\nTwo weeks after the outbreak began, all of the students at Rowhurst become trapped within the school as more and more teachers began to get sick. The boys were aided by the English teacher Mr. Hewitt, who was the last of the teachers to turn.[1]\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe Dead (2010)\n\nJack is first seen in a classroom, holding a cricket bat, trying to kill a teacher called Mr. Hewitt. His friend Ed is crouching under a table, terrified, infuriating Jack. Eventually, Jack persuades Ed to hit Mr. Hewitt, as Jack is tired from not sleeping for two nights. However, Ed's hit is weak, and the boys are about get eaten when Mr. Hewitt's guts spill open. The pair run out, and are ambushed by teachers but are saved by Harry \"'Bam\" Bamford and a team of rugby players. Together they make is safely back to the room a group of students have barricaded against the grown-ups. That night, Jack and the boys decide to leave the next morning, as they are running out of rations and the teachers are always coming back in an endless stream.\n\nThe following morning, they attempt to make their way out of Rowhurst, narrowly avoiding infected teachers. Whilst trying to escape, Jack smashes a plank of wood with a nail in it into the head of Monsieur Morel, the French teacher. As they are all running across the field to get to the school chapel, Jack stops Ed and points out a girl in the window of a flat. They run back and wonder why she doesn't just exit through the doors, but realise that there are teachers blocking it. Ed and Jack pick up a wheelie bin and smash the windows with it. They proceed to help her escape from the building and eventually, the three of them catch up with the others. The girl reveals her name to be Frédérique and she is with her pet cat Dior.\n\nThe students then make their way to the school's chapel, where they find the students who holed up there are currently suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. Jack decides to head to London to go to his house along the Mad Matt and his acolytes. Jack, Matt and the acolytes meet up half an hour later with Ed, half the other students, Greg and the other kids on the bus. Jack and Greg instantly don't like each other and Jack keeps finding ways to make Greg mad. After Greg turns sick, he and Bam help clear a path to the Imperial War Museum. When inside, they meet Jordan Hordern, DogNut and the other museum kids. The next day; Jack, Ed, Bam, Brooke, Aleisha, Courtney, Fredrique, Justin and DogNut go and look for food. They find a filled Tesco truck and decide to drive it back to the museum. While heading back, Jack, Ed and Bam jump off the truck and head towards Jack's house.\n\nThey make their way to the Oval Cricket Grounds where Jack picks up a machine gun from a diseased soldier. They go into the Oval and end up being chased by sickos from inside and outside the stadium. Jack, not knowing how to work his gun, hits two gas tanks and causes an explosion and a massive fire. Bam, who thought he was a sicko, shot Jack after the explosion. The three boys then make it out of the Oval and make their way to a neighbourhood where they get attacked by twenty sickos. The boys defeat the sickos, but just after the attack, a diseased Greg kills Bam with a meat cleaver and fatally wounds Jack. Ed now on his own still manages to get Jack all the way home, Ed takes Jack into his bedroom and finds Jack's old stuffy Floppy Dog. He hands Floppy Dog over to Jack and they both fall asleep in his bed. That night, Jack died in his sleep from blood loss.\n\nAfter waking up, Ed grabbed all the food he can find and an London A-Z. He then put every single flammable object in Jack's house into a pile in Jack's room, and set it on fire to stop any future looting and so his friend could rest in peace.\n\nLegacy\n\nTo be added.\n\nRelationships\n\nTo be added.\n\nKills\n\nBook Victim Fate of Victim The Dead Monsieur Morel Bashed in the face with a wooden plank by Jack.
