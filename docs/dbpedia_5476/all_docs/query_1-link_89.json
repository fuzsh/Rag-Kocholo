LEWIS NKOSI will always be remembered at Harvard University as the Nieman Fellow who could not go home. Mr. Nkosi, who began his career as a journalist in South Africa in the mid-1950's, left Johannesburg for Cambridge, Mass., in 1961 on a one-way permit. He has been barred from returning ever since. A professor of literature at the University of Zambia, Mr. Nkosi is a highly regarded literary critic whose works ''Home and Exile'' (1965) and ''Tasks and Masks'' (1981) are standards. As a playwright and short-story writer, he is also the most subtly experimental of the black South African writers, many of whom are caught in the immediacy of the struggle against apartheid.\n\n''Mating Birds,'' his first novel, confronts boldly and imaginatively the strange interplay of bondage, desire and torture inherent in interracial sexual relationships within the South African prison house of apartheid. His play ''The Rhythm of Violence'' and his short story ''The Prisoner'' explored related themes. The treatment of miscegenation as a political indictment of a racist South Africa is not without its literary dangers and risks, however, and Mr. Nkosi's novel does not entirely escape them.",

Mr. Nkosi, who began his career as a journalist in South Africa in the mid-1950's, left Johannesburg for Cambridge, Mass., in 1961 on a one-way permit. He has been barred from returning ever since. A professor of literature at the University of Zambia, Mr. Nkosi is a highly regarded literary critic whose works ''Home and Exile'' (1965) and ''Tasks and Masks'' (1981) are standards. As a playwright and short-story writer, he is also the most subtly experimental of the black South African writers, many of whom are caught in the immediacy of the struggle against apartheid.\n\n''Mating Birds,'' his first novel, confronts boldly and imaginatively the strange interplay of bondage, desire and torture inherent in interracial sexual relationships within the South African prison house of apartheid. His play ''The Rhythm of Violence'' and his short story ''The Prisoner'' explored related themes. The treatment of miscegenation as a political indictment of a racist South Africa is not without its literary dangers and risks, however, and Mr. Nkosi's novel does not entirely escape them.\n\nBlack and white miscegenation has a long and curious history in literature, ranging in extremes from Shakespeare's representation of self-destructive jealousy in the figure of the noble blackamoor Othello to the pseudonymous American novelist Oliver Bolokitten's bizarre and perverse 1835 novel, ''A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation, in the Year of Our Lord, 19--.'' In Bolokitten's novel, white male and black female ''amalgamation'' is made possible only by the invention of an ''ingenious'' machine that protects ''the husbands from those disagreeable evaporations exhaling from the odoriferous spouse . . . by fanning off the offensive air, and at the same time dispensing, by means of the vials, a delightful perfume.'' Perhaps Bolokitten was an Afrikaner.\n\nWe have come a long way from Bolokitten's racism to civil rights romance films starring Sidney Poitier (''A Patch of Blue,'' ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'') and the cross-racial sexual encounters on prime-time television, from ''Dynasty'' and ''Falcon Crest'' to ''The Jeffersons'' and even ''Kate and Allie.'' Miscegenation in these instances is a metaphor for social harmony and individual possibility.\n\nMore often than not, black authors write of interracial sex as a metaphor for self-destruction or in terms of the penalties exacted for violating a taboo. LeRoi Jones's allegorical play ''The Dutchman'' (1964) is a prime example of this genre. Clay, a middle-class black man, is stabbed to death by Lula, a white prostitute, after he flirts outrageously with her during a subway ride. Even where the sexual taboo is only implied, as in Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' (1940), the results are the same: Bigger Thomas, discovered alone with a drunken white girl in her bedroom, panics, smothers her while trying to stifle her drowsy voice and is sentenced to death. The white woman, in black literature, is bad news.\n\nMr. Nkosi's novel leaves this pattern undisturbed. Indeed, ''Mating Birds'' recalls in several ways both ''The Dutchman'' and ''Native Son,'' as well as Camus's ''Stranger,'' ''Othello'' and Hegel's well-known essay ''Of Lordship and Bondage,'' with a dash of Freud thrown in for flavor. It also brings to mind the persona of Eldridge Cleaver's ''Soul on Ice,'' obsessed with white women. These echoes seem intentional; indeed, this novel often reads as if Bigger Thomas had raped Mary Dalton before he killed her, then written a prison memoir from his cell on death row, discussing the social forces that made him do it and using Camus, Cleaver and Hegel as sources.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
