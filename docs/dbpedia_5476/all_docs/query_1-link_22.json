He lived in South African under apartheid until he was 22 years old. Although his works were banned in South Africa under the Suppression of Communism Act he became the first black South African journalist to win a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University. When he applied for permission to go to the USA he was granted a one-way exit permit to leave South Africa, thus being barred from returning. He accepted the scholarship and left the country in 1961, beginning a 30-year exile. He subsequently lived in Central Africa, Britain, Poland, France and Switzerland. He returned to South Africa in 2001.\n\nAstrid Starck-Adler was Professor Emerita of German and Yiddish Literature at both the Department of German and Jewish Studies, University of Basel, Switzerland, and the Université de Haute in Alsace, France.\n\nDag Henrichen is a Namibian historian at the Basler Afrika Bibliographien in Switzerland."
