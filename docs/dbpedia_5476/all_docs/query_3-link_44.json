Bhabha's statement prompts one to reflect on the multi-faceted marginalised situation faced by the exiled subject.\n\nIt can be argued that Lewis Nkosi, a black exiled South African writer, has remained a largely under- researched writer, particularly in South Africa. His works have not been as widely researched possibly as those of his contemporaries, despite his local and international profile and reputation as an astute scholar and writer, for various reasons which this thesis will explore. His writings and extensive commentaries on African and world literature certainly merit research, particularly in respect of his construction of place and identity. He has been influential in South African letters and frequently cited - however, his years outside the country have led to his neglect within South Africa. This thesis hopes to go some way towards recovering Lewis Nkosi as writer and scholar, particularly in terms of his construction of identity, both within South Africa and as exile.\n\nThis thesis will examine representative texts by this writer, using perspectives of theorists such as Fanon (1986), Bhabha (1994), Said (1983) and Quayson (2002) among other writers who particularly discuss notions of space and place from a post colonial perspective. Reference to Nkosi's own history as well as his non-fictional writing will be seen as relevant in defining what 'home' and 'exile' have meant to Nkosi and how a construction of 'place' enhances the sense of identity. The question to be considered is: how, through his writing - both non-fiction and fiction - does Nkosi construct identity through place, how, in other words, has he pushed back boundaries as an exile writer? Here the impact that place has on our understanding of who we are will be explored.\n\nThis thesis will investigate then the development, perception and experience of place and identity in the works of this writer. Nkosi's somewhat nomadic lifestyle in exile makes him an interesting case: the exposure to American and European culture he enjoyed as a writer in exile has not been\n\n(7)\n\nanalysed as they developed first in his early journalism days of Ilanga lase Natal and Drum, and subsequently in his primary works of critical essays and later fiction. Nkosi's act of writing is also the place where identity and memory meet, and this study will refer to early literary essays contained in his literary works Home and Exile (1965), The Transplanted Heart (1975) and Tasks and Masks (1981). A reading of these works together with his many earlier articles and reviews as well as his latest novels and dramas, will show the ways in which this writer self-consciously participates in the construction of place and identity, how he explores, through his writing, his sense of place and his identity as a South African exile, and how his perceptions may have changed during his long career as writer. As Nkosi affirms: \"all of those are strands of memory about place and it automatically gets into your writing, because I think, it is both the terrain of consciousness and the orientation to reality\" (Lombardozzi 2003:331).\n\nThis dissertation will focus then, on the construction of home, identity and exile in Nkosi's discourse, written over nearly five decades of South Africa's turbulent history, a period during which all these terms were contested sites. Theories of place and identity are inevitably made more complex by the condition of exile, as place and identity are immutably concatenated, so that what is said about place must also include the construction of identity. In this regard theorists on exile such as Grant (1979), Gurr (1981), Seidel (1986), Robinson (1994) and Whitehouse (2000) will be examined, and theorists such as Cartey (1969), Fanon (1986), Owomoyela (1996) and Walter (2003) on the issue of identity will be considered.\n\nThe thesis will therefore position Nkosi in terms of his generation of exile writers, and how this has impacted on his construction of identity, and will to this end, explore interconnected issues surrounding home, identity and exile.\n\n(8)\n\ni\n\nIntroduction\n\nlam an African...\n\nI am the grandchild of the warrior men and women who entered Sekukuneland, patriots that Cetswayo and Mphepu took to battle, the soldiers Moshoeshoe and Ngungunyane taught never to dishonour the cause of freedom ... I am the child of Nongqawuse... and being part of all these people, and in the knowledge that none dares contest that assertion\n\nI shall claim that I am an African Today\n\nIt feels good to be an African, (part of the inaugural speech given by President Thabo Mbeki 1999)\n\nSouth Africa's colonial history has been the subject of much ongoing debate and analysis by many scholars and critics alike. In this country the colonial reality was a nexus for monopolised power which, particularly for the black African, all too often resulted in hollow promises and broken dreams. The 60s and 70s were periods of deep racial antagonism, a time marked with intense anger and frustration, the struggle against the menace of apartheid dominating almost every aspect of black (and white) existence. Almost certainly there was no more compelling cause of racial antagonism between black and white than the manner in which largely unjust laws were inflicted on the black communities, and in the manner in which black identity and culture was trampled on by the white hegemony. The narrow interests of apartheid prevailed over social, political and demographical dynamics, with scant regard given to the common history, language and culture of the black South African citizen, resulting in the exile of many South Africans across the colour spectrum.\n\nIt was essentially these tensions and conflicts between black and white which contributed much raw material for the emergence of a powerful body of African literature, notably by exiled writers who sought through their writing, to mobilise against the harsh indignities of colonial oppression beginning to manifest through treason trials, banning and gagging orders and enforced removals.\n\nThese writers, despite attempts at their repression, actively and purposefully used literature to represent the political revolution, albeit in fictional terms. As far as black voices were concerned, much had already gone underground in an attempt to evade and survive apartheid's determined onslaught on black creativity, as writing was the only vehicle through which the African intelligentsia could attempt to make sense of their past, survive the present and so draw a map for\n\n(9)\n\nthe literary and pohtical journey ahead. Their birthright to identify themselves and be accepted as South Africans having been denied them, they adopted an identity which was in essence dialogic;\n\nprotest literature and protest actions became the focal point of resistence against the repression of apartheid. In South African literature, themes of exile and displacement began to replicate the South African realities.\n\nLewis Nkosi, like many of his contemporaries, was ahenated from his country of birth at an early age by the apartheid rule, and his often cynical voice may perhaps be attributed to his experiences of apartheid and its concomitant extreme social and cultural deprivation. His exile in many ways can be regarded as the catalyst for redefining himself and the purpose of his art, and thus his early writing functioned as a sounding board to examine the complexities of black lives in South Africa.\n\nHis writing fiercely opposed the ideology of division and distrust, to this end introducing many different frames of reference to African literature as art form. Nkosi was resolute in his quest to promote and encourage African literature and raise renewed awareness for all things African throughout his peripatetic writing career:\n\nThe brutal emptiness from whence issue our works of art is only partially filled by novels written in other countries, by plays created out of other people's lives, and by love songs fashioned out in Europe and America. We live on a substitute culture borrowed from other lands. (Nkosi 1983:126)\n\nFinding his own voice in writing liberated Nkosi from the fetters of his marginalised history, providing him with an understanding of his world as process and transformation.\n\nAgainst this background the sounding elements of this thesis, these being identity, home and exile, are explored in the main through the considerable varied oeuvre of this exiled writer, a South African writer native to KwaZulu-Natal, a black writer who has remained unafraid and unparochial throughout, and who, in many extraordinary ways, has remained atypical of his generation of exile writers, both in South Africa and abroad. The perception of place, identity and exile as manifested in his writings, viewed from both a postcolonial perspective, and the ambiguous ways in which this writer expresses and explores the loss of his country and his pride and longing of his South African identity as supported by his writing, are relevant to this study.\n\nNkosi's literary peregrinations across Africa and abroad are informed throughout by the landscapes of his imagination and memory, encapsulating the sum total of his experiences rooted primarily in a racially and politically divided South Africa, and secondly in the countries of his exile. Nkosi\n\n(10)\n\niii\n\ndeparted dramatically from South Africa as a young journalist and aspiring writer to emerge marked but undaunted as a mature and erudite writer. Nkosi continues to define his experiences\n\nof exile, place and identity through his writing. In particular his fiction is clearly underpinned and shaped by experiences of displacement and loss.\n\nNkosi's critical reviews and literary contributions reflect not only a personal engagement with division and loss, but engage with the complexities common to all troubled societies living a life under segregation. His polemics seek to expose the politics of literature through argument and debate and in doing so, his writing creates new ways of seeing. His often acerbic, dissonant yet principled voice has enriched the nous of black literature, both locally and internationally, with his sharp creativity and skilled craftsmanship with words:\n\nIn all his critical writing, judicious and far sighted as it mainly is, Nkosi remains a unique and candid personality - never adopting the grey cloak of academic objectivity. He is always open, if often controversial and sometimes pugnacious ... he speaks with the authority of both great knowledge of and full commitment to his subject - he involves his reader, demanding (always) a thoughtful response, whether one agrees or disagrees with the point/s he articulates.\n\n(Gagiano in Stiebel and Gunner 2005:5)\n\nHis voice reaches into the future and attempts throughout to guide other African writers in a time of transition and transformation, through the relevance of his thoughts and his inspired advice on black writing. His range as writer and critic is broad, perhaps sometimes even disparate, but ultimately forms a cohesive vision centring on intellectual emancipation. Nkosi's experiences as an exiled writer speak for all marginalised Africans and in his writing he encourages black writers to reconnect with their roots through an understanding of their literature: \"What we clearly need in South Africa is a vocabulary which bears witness to our variousness as a people, but which may also do more, securing us as an individuahty, a sense of repose in our completeness as a nation\"\n\n(Nkosi 1983:127).\n\nExile in many ways enabled Nkosi to realise his potential as a writer, a creative energy which perhaps would have been lost to the literary world had he remained here to become just another apartheid casualty in South Africa. There are other South African exiled writers, irrespective of race, such as Breyten Breytenbach, Es'kia Mphahlele and Perseus Adams, who speak for the exiled writer when they attest to their exile experiences as not being altogether a punishment, but rather, experienced it as a spiritual boon. Adams, much like Nkosi, reflects in retrospect that:\n\n(11)\n\nthe experience [of exile] was giving me a deeper insight into the suffering of black and brown people in South Africa... it also added to my understanding, my appreciation of what other exiles were going through ... besides, loneliness and isolation were not new to me. In South Africa - where your skin is your uniform -1 often felt more of an exile, more of an outsider, than I do here. (Adams 1984: 265)\n\nCope, in a discussion on writers and literature, however, warns against exile being \"overestimated as a crucial factor. Writers, like anyone else, take with them, wherever they go or stay put, their own impedimenta of talents, gifts, faults and defects\" (Cope 1984:270). Hence, although the imposition of exile is not without negative implications, and although environmental and social influences are often the impelling forces which motivate writing, exile per se need not altogether indicate or imply negativity in the psyche of the writer. Indeed, a condition of loss and deprivation can conversely liberate the creative spirit which in turn often contributes to profound perceptions which might never otherwise have come to the fore. Nkosi's exile is testimony to this, as his experiences, local and abroad, have ultimately manifested as a creative literary testimony of the universal human condition, particularly evinced through his novels and plays. Despite having Hved his life in a highly politicised space, his writing has never had as its primary intention political sloganeering. Rather, he has carefully nurtured language and writing into an artistic social expression, believing that\n\n\"language must be inhabited, it must be enlarged by usage\"(Nkosi 1983:126).\n\nFor no other reason than being a black person, Nkosi was denied a cultural space during his formative years in the broader South African community. 'Home' to Nkosi was the townships, which he asserts, were created particularly for people like himself; townships were places created not for those who did not have to live there, but for those who were displacedihere. Space as home- place, particularly for Nkosi is conceptualised in the imagination, and exists alongside time and culture, necessitating a historical process and a historical subject to give it shape. Despite being a perceptual product of an abstract notion, to Nkosi place and space is always more than just the material or the tangible. During a recent discussion Nkosi explained that he perceived the notion 'place' as defining a cultural area, created initially by a community through oral traditions and songs about that particular space or environment, so that place does not exist until then. For example, Sophiatown, according to Nkosi, only came into existence as imaginative place \"when the inhabitants began to write and compose about this place\" (Lombardozzi in conversation with Lewis Nkosi 2004). Hence place and space are cardinal to Nkosi's fiction as the setting dictates the narrative and provides the characters with a place and a history. Underpinning the geography of place in Nkosi's fiction are also the symbolic exploratory journeys of exile and a search for identity\n\n(12)\n\nV\n\nand belonging, concerns irrevocably linked to place and uppermost in the consciousness of the displaced exile.\n\nAlthough sharing a parallel background with some of his exiled contemporaries, Nkosi has steadfastly remained the 'outsider' and is unlike his generation of writers in many respects. Like most African people living in South Africa during the apartheid years, Nkosi was forced into a separatist racial divide filled with the mediocrities and squalor of slum life. He was astute in recognising the encroaching and restrictive apartheid system as a serious impediment to conscious recognition and acceptance. Thus armed with little else other than ambition and clinging stubbornly to the belief of the possibilities of an alternative and improved lifestyle, he embraced his life of exile much like the intrepid adventurers of the English classics he so avidly read as a young boy, more broadly discussed in Chapter Two.\n\nIn the act of taking refuge in the realms of the printed word and intellectual pursuits, Nkosi's exile enabled him, to a certain extent, to escape the many violations of human freedom he had become accustomed to under apartheid. Literature provided Nkosi with an on-going education in the English language, the fluent acquisition thereof which was to provide him with a celebrated academic and literary career. Writing also enabled Nkosi more easily to assimilate various influences; his 'home' in letters furnished him with a secure and privileged space within which he was afforded the freedom to create a broad range of literary disciplines, ranging from critical essays to partly biographical fiction. His writing is never insular nor parochial, even if undertaken from an international stage. Nkosi is a writer who has, throughout his writing career, constantly urged other writers to strive to define and respond to societal challenges through literature in support of a continent critically engaged in reclaiming its African identity:\n\nRather than censor our thoughts as writers, we should consider creating undaunted, believing that die future generations are going to be the true judges ... because literature records, replays and inspires an on-going process. As an act of language that renews and revitalises, it is a vehicle of thought and feeling that should increase by reliving experiences; literature is forever stirring us up. It is its own revolution. (Mphahlele 1999:133)\n\nStill writing today, Nkosi exercises, \"potentially what Bakhtin calls an 'exotopy', a vision from the outside through which he or she can see what those on the inside (at home) cannot\" (Weiss 1992:12). Exile has provided Nkosi with both significant creative opportunities and an individual clarity of voice, and as the ensuing chapters of this thesis will show, he has certainly progressed\n\n(13)\n\nimmensely since the days of being, according to Casey Motsisi, the \"angriest Angry Young Man, who, refused a passport, but being a great lover of knowledge, decided to leave us to struggle on for good\" (Motsisi 1963:14).\n\nDrawing on the above generally summarised points, the thesis will proceed with Chapter One which has as its central concerns the condition of exile and the various theories which underpin the construction of home and identity in the writing of Nkosi. Chapter One will also look at the way exile has problematised Nkosi's sense of home and emplacement, as it is important to recognise that a particular sense of place may also negatively affect the filiation and affiliation process. The character and differences of both authentic and fictionalised place and space, significant as they are linked to personal feelings and experience, will be discussed in terms of Nkosi's sense of belonging and his construction of identity. Issues of identity and place are complex, therefore this chapter will draw on a range of theoretical debates, creating a theoretical framework which will serve to support the examination of the various issues in the subsequent chapters. Identity in this chapter will be considered as primarily the conceptualisation of the self, a complex notion at best since the self, a unique Oestalt greatly influenced by societal expectations, can be defined in many different ways.\n\nTheorists who discuss the notions of exile, place and identity, for example Lapping (1969), Noyes (1981), Robinson (1994), Urry (1995) and Morley (1995) and writers who contribute to this research are relevant. The applicability of postcolonial theory in terms of the exploration of issues surrounding colonisation, exile and identity is also relevant to this research.\n\nChapter Two situates Nkosi in terms of South African politics and also sets out the multitude of biographical details of this writer, positioning Nkosi and his writing in a particular historical context from which to consider the construction of place and identity in his writing. This detailed biographical sketch serves as a useful historical reference and provides an extensive background to the contents of the thesis as a whole. A time line is also provided tracing his trajectory across the globe since his exile, from South Africa to the USA, London, Zambia, Warsaw, USA and returning to his current 'home', Basel in Switzerland.\n\nChapter Three investigates Nkosi's non-fiction writing as an academic and critic. This chapter provides a discursive debate on his collection of essays, literary criticism and other non-fiction writing, as well as his role and position, viewed from a postcolonial perspective. This chapter considers how Nkosi has situated himself in terms of other South African black writers and how this impacts on his construction of identity. His non-fiction writing, an admixture of political and aesthetic persuasion, is the product of a sustained research on literary discourse and his work is\n\n(14)\n\nvii\n\ncharacterised by attempts to deconstruct the myths of black writing and to achieve an African world view which is holistic.\n\nChapter Four focuses on Nkosi's novels and short stories in terms of his fictionalised landscapes, the use of symbolism and the influences of modernist writers in his construction of home and identity. This chapter will consider how Nkosi in particular, relates to South Africa - his construction of place will be illustrated through an analysis of his fictional writings. One cannot hope to understand Nkosi without a consideration of his novels, as memories of home play a cardinal role in the novels of this writer. His characters not only reflect his own history, but also the institutions of the Zulu people as a nation. Significantly, and despite being a long-term expatriate, the focus of his novels remains on historical apartheid themes. They are exclusively set in a South African milieu, although they were all written abroad. Despite bis globalised exile - having been exposed to a diversity of other countries, literatures, cultures and languages - his novels strongly suggest that he has to a great degree retained his South African social and cultural characteristics, despite his desire to be cosmopolitan in his early years, finding catharsis in aggressive intellectual and literary pursuits and confrontations.\n\nChapter Five addresses aspects of his plays and his small poetic oeuvre, and what these reveal of the writer's sense of place and identity. It is interesting to note that Nkosi's plays The Black Psychiatrist and \"Flying Home \", incongruously and perversely, are set in London, whilst most of his other works have all had their contents rooted in a South African context. The inclusion of his poetry portrays a dimension of Nkosi not previously widely known. These poems were recently published collectively in Still Beating the Drum (2005), a book of critical perspectives on Nkosi.\n\nChapter Six concludes this thesis with a discussion of Nkosi's current work and the future direction he is likely to take now that the political dispensation in South Africa has changed the face of this country. Given the fact that he has received little recognition in South African as a native son and writer, perhaps this thesis will also to some extent serve to illustrate the relevance and importance of Nkosi as a South African writer. Nkosi is arguably one of the most versatile black South African writers whose opus encompasses several literary genres including the novel as fictionalised autobiography, the short story, the essay, drama, academic literary criticism, film and radio texts, journal articles and poetry. Always writing from double borders created by the spaces between continents and straddling two worlds, that of the dispossessed exile and the lettered world of academia, Nkosi has nevertheless shown a deep concern for South African literature and South African writers, whom he firmly believes \"must continue to be the unsilenced voice ... a great deal\n\n(15)\n\nof my function, both as living embodiment of my culture and as creative artist abroad, must be to preserve for the world the memory of those I left behind in South Africa\" (Nkosi 1983:95).\n\nLewis Nkosi, as a writer and as an individual, remains enigmatic at best, but what will become unmistakably clear through this thesis is that:\n\nhis is a voice that has been critical and criticised; it has not always been an easy one to listen to, but the fact that is has endured and continues to speak gives the literary critic ample scope for a timely consideration of what he has had to say to us collectively. (Stiebel and Gunner 2005:Preface)\n\n(16)\n\nChapter 1\n\nTheorising exile, home and identity\n\nYou can't know somebody... until you've followed him home.\n\n(Kingsolver 2004:231)\n\nThis chapter will serve to introduce the primary concerns of this thesis, these being the development of identity within the artificially imposed, and often provocative, definitions of exile, spatial discourse and identity, and the effects of these sounding elements on the writings of Lewis Nkosi.\n\nThese issues will be positioned within a particular historical system of governance in South Africa, that of apartheid, and viewed against a discourse of postcolonial theory. A brief exegesis of postcolonial theory is provided as a frame of reference and centrally to illustrate its relevancy in terms of the concerns of this thesis. Issues of exile and identity are firmly rooted in the key concepts of colonial discourse, these being displacement and marginalisation, abject markers of authority historically challenged by the subaltern voice.\n\nPostcolonial theory rests on four disparate European traditions of thought, namely Marxist theories, feminism, post-structuralist tninking and psychoanalysis, describing a state of being, defined by \"its place in the passage of epochal history, and a critical orientation towards the reading of the past, not least of its textual traces\" (Goldberg 2002:5). This theory and its many discursive frames grew out of literary studies as a discourse committed to a critique favouring a post-structuralist and cultural perspective. Postcolonial theory bases its argument primarily on literary works which have as concerns the binary relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed, and for this reason is central to the discussion of exile, place and identity. As Walder correctly points out, the label 'postcolonial' is at best obfuscating, however, it is useful to this thesis, as these theories, functioning as indicators of historical and cultural change, create a deeper awareness of these changes. Viewing issues of exile, identity and home through the lens of postcolonial thinking are important to this thesis, as these theories, by their very nature, will assist in raising important questions on issues of exile and identity. Implicit in these theories is the assumption that \"what we are talking about has to do with large-scale historical phenomena, phenomena involving shifting power relationships between different parts of the world as well as between people within particular territories\" (Walder\n\n1998:3).\n\nExile is not new to South African literature. Issues of exile and home have shaped much of the content of the literary works by many of these writers, including Lewis Nkosi, Bessie Head, Es'kia\n\n(17)\n\nMphahlele, Arthur Nortje and Breyten Breytenbach amongst others. In this respect postcolonial theory, which has historically through various foci regarded exile as a mode of transition, is well suited to the analysis of the experiences and representation of the exile in transit. Postcolonial theory as a discourse predicated on difference, views the writer in exile as being disconnected from his roots, and hence draws heavily on the processes of displacement and dispossession. These various perspectives have particular relevance to this study on Lewis Nkosi, a South African exile for most of his life, a life lived in a black skin inscribed with the well-known words of Fanon, \"o my body, make of me always a man who questions\" (Fanon 1986:232).\n\nAlthough the scope of this study cannot hope to provide a full investigation into all complexities of exile, spatial discourse and identity, it will however address the key perspectives relevant to these concepts through a brief discussion of postcolonial theorists and especially thereafter their applicability to Lewis Nkosi and his writing. These issues are set against the wider debate within postcolonial theory with marginality as the basis of identity and place politics. Postcolonial thinking in particular will be a useful hybrid discourse to examine the ways in which Lewis Nkosi self- consciously participates in the construction of place and identity and how these constructions are evident in his academic essays and works of fiction, all written from a position of exile. For the erstwhile colonised exile, the search for identity and the construction of a 'home' amounts to the same thing - typically, home is \"set in the past, in the memories of childhood and home, which is the only basis for a sense of identity which the exile can maintain\" (Gurr 1981:11). This observation is strongly supported by Nkosi's most recent novel, Mandela's Ego (2006), which is set in the past memories of Nkosi's rural childhood. As will be discussed in Chapter Two, Nkosi was born into a class defined by political marginalisation and chronic poverty; he grew up in a country where the ruling voice was white and racist; and as a young man he could enjoy the privileges of assimilation only by virtue of his position as a journalist. He was forced into exile in 1960 when he accepted the Nieman Fellowship to study at Harvard, and left South Africa the same year, having forced the Government to provide him with an exit permit by signing the required undertaking never to return.\n\nExile provided Nkosi with a mask behind which he could undertake the rebuilding of a new life, with very little in the way of positive signposts or markers as to what 'home' should be, only that, at the heart of home lies almost \"the mystical need to belong, and only you know the way\" (Gready 1994:510); thus for Nkosi die concept of 'home' as discussed in Gready, becomes an ambivalent and confused space or home-place: home is most importantly a function of place. \"There is no place like home: there is no home like place. Home is fixed in time ... and a time set in place, and yet it dissolves and evolves, acquires the accretions of other times and of other places\" (510).\n\n(18)\n\n3\n\nHence it is not surprising that Nkosi sought to remake his 'home' through writing and language, a space and place in which he was free to construct 'home' to be anything he wanted it to be.\n\nSimilarly, and possibly for the same reason, Miriam Makeba chose the concert stage as her home- place, because \"this is the one place where I am most at home and where there is no exile\" (Makeba 1988:230). Exile may wear many masks, and it is sometimes difficult to find an appropriate mask for Nkosi, as he has never indicated that he embraced exile as an identity even if he at times assumes the position of the self-alienated artist, the exile by choice, the traveller, the internal emigre, the victim of enforced expulsion, and the expatriate. Perhaps Christopher Hope's qualification of a so- called exile identity may remove the need for any mask:\n\nof course questions arise when you come to settle in that 'elsewhere' and yet continue to look homeward in your writing ... exile is a status so brutally forced upon many who do not want it that it seems wrong to use it, and voluntary exile is a contradiction in terms ... well then, retaining as I do that early inbred passion for classification of my native land, I search until I find a name that fits: I am an escapee. I have gone over the wall, and mine is a view from the hills. (Hope 1984:285)\n\nWhatever else exile may have provided or have meant to Nkosi, one certainty is that exile provided him with a strategic retreat; being initially ambivalent about his departure, exile conversely legitimised his decision to sever his ties with South Africa. It also conferred upon him the ability, much like a chameleon, to adapt by developing a multicultural identity by which to protect himself from other South Africans and the expected racial slurs against a black skin:\n\nThe notion of exile was not constructed in Johannesburg or Cape Town... it was done here. London was die place ... in the early 60s ... there were those South Africans who had been involved in the liberation politics and had come here because they had nowhere else to go ... they also came here because England was a place they got jobs ... there were those who had no politics but who had come here to improve their own personal situation... these groups meet here and it is they who meet and form a kind of little exile community who define themselves as exiles and who theorise out the conditions of exile. (Israel 1999:142)\n\nIsrael points out that not all exiles were automatically welcomed into the exile community abroad as national heroes - there were many hostilities against South African exiles by other exiled groups and dissidents: \"I mean it was terrible ... it's a very incestuous thing this South African exile thing ... the word had come out amongst some people that we were deserters, we were traitors ... there were some people that did not actually talk to us ...\" (Israel 1999:149). Returned exiles who would talk to me about their exile in the terms of this thesis concur wholly with many of the issues raised\n\n(19)\n\nby Israel and other writers on the fragmentary nature of the condition of exile. Both Parker (1993) and Israel (1999) credit Nkosi with playing an important role in 'popularising', if you will, the notion of exile in 1965, as he had created an epistemology on displacement that distinguished between the bipolar opposites, 'home' and 'exile', particularly in his essays on exile in Home and Exile (1983). In these early pieces Nkosi expressed his onerous position as an exile abroad, and was passionately concerned about expressing bis solidarity with the oppressed in addressing the problems of South African writing through his writing. Further aspects of Nkosi's life will more fully be discussed later in this chapter, in the biographical sketch provided in Chapter Two and his non-fictional writing in Chapter Three.\n\nNothing is perhaps more disparate in intellectual life today than the concept of exile and its related nuances, and much has been written on the subject of exile, a primordial theme with its roots entrenched in biblical history as far back as the fourth century BC. Much of the early influential literature was composed under conditions of incarceration and involuntary exile; the Bible itself has as its origins varying themes of exile. In early Greek and Roman history exile was reserved for influential members of public importance; lesser mortals, in particular writers, were simply deprived of their pensions. In its many different forms, exile, a punishment largely imposed by society through geographical displacement and cultural marginalisation, has been a recurrent human experience, with many differing and contested definitions. As many of these experiences have been expressed in and through writing, it is then pertinent to examine the ways in which exile has been articulated and transformed in the writings of exiled writers. There is a plethora of different kinds of literary exile scattered across the pages of world history, from Plato to Dante, Neruda to Beckett and many others, including African, postcolonial and South African writers, giving rise to a body of writing which tends to support the position, that in spite of any personal or political trauma, these writers have, to a greater or lesser degree, gained imaginative sustenance from exile.\n\nThe twentieth century had more so than any other period in history, documented an enormous exodus of displaced people. Many people around the globe have fled their homelands often due to factors such as ongoing global disequilibrium, political conflicts and social disintegration, making exile and homelessness today, whether elective or imposed, a common experience. The experience of modern exile involves not only enforced dispossession, but also:\n\n(20)\n\n5\n\na spatial and psychological deracination of place, language, identity, tradition, ethos and world view, and resistance to these forms of (neo)colonial sub- alternisation. This displacement seen as an ongoing process of transnational and transcultural selective adaptation ... and destabilises the notion of clear-cut borders. (Walter 2003:23)\n\nHowever, despite exile as global displacement, every exiled subject, bound to a particular place and time, or a particular memory of place and time, experiences exile as unique and idiosyncratic, exile is never a uniform experience, hence making an equitable definition of exile almost impossible. The experience of exile has innumerable variations, as it is not one but many things. For some, exile is\n\n\"an identity, an honourable status; for others it is a censure, representing disloyalty; it may also be a classification, a bureaucratic means of handling people which may have any number of anticipated and unanticipated consequences\" (Israel 1999:7). What is abundantly clear, particularly in terms of Nkosi's exile, is that exile is a condition of absence that cannot be filled:\n\neither by returning home or to a former identity, manner of perception or ways of thinking... there can be no true return for the colonial in the metropolis ... the colonial is a product of revolution, and this revolution takes place in the mind. For the exile a similar revolution of the mind must take place to unify the self and construct a sense of society and home. This involves a new way of seeing. (Weiss 1992:91)\n\nExile as a multifaceted concept hence requires a radical redefinition, re-interpretation and modification as a term for dislocation, as it has moved away from a strictly political definition to include a wider cultural and economically driven displacement. Exile is not only a division between the self and others, but is also a manner of perception from the margins of another world. As Nkosi also observes, modern exile is not exclusively confined to \"the massive displacement of peoples from their homelands, but can also be located in the specific forms of silencing opposition without expulsion\" (Nkosi 1994e :5). Nkosi is referring here to a form of exile that was imposed through the gagging orders under the Suppression of Communism Act in South Africa, hence exile as a history of spatial displacement is often driven and enforced by political forms of power. Defining the term 'exile' in terms of postcolonial concerns has remained a complex and important intellectual debate for theorists, particularly due to the multiple and variegated evolution of this ambivalent term, as no two writers or intellectuals think of exile in the same way. Perhaps Stephen Slemon's modalities of the terms 'colonial' and 'postcolonialism' in his essay \"The Scramble for Post- Colonialism' (1995) can serve to refine the term 'exile' and the exilic experience in describing exile as:\n\n(21)\n\na name for a condition of nativist longing in post dependence national groupings, as a cultural marker of non-residency for a third world intellectual cadre, as the inevitable underside of a fractured and ambivalent discourse of colonialist power, as an oppositional form of reading practice and ... as the name for a category of literary activity. (Slemon 1994: 158)\n\nGenerally, theories often tend to oversimplify exile and sometimes succeed in portraying die defining characteristics as unproblematised and idealised elements, but the emotional condition of exile underpinned by physical and symbolic violence and despair, can never be adequately- addressed by meories. Postcolonial theories often fail adequately to include the cruel realities which inscribe the concept of exile and the rhetoric of exit, displacement and return - the many expressions of this state of being encapsulated in attenuated labelling: separation, expatriation, banishment, deportation, eviction, disruption, acculturation, integration and estrangement being a few. Suleiman cogently summarises exile as: \" i n its narrow sense a political banishment, exile in its broad sense designates every kind of estrangement, from the physical and the geographical to the spiritual \"\n\n(Suleiman 1998: 3).\n\nThe ultimate purpose Of exile is to prevent airy further vitiation of the dominant regime; the subordinate is disarticulated from all that constitutes home and is hence deemed suitably chastised.\n\nImplicit in this dislocation is also the preclusion of any future re-connection with the familiar.\n\nIronically and conversely, Lewis Nkosi's 'exile' almost did net happen, as the government of the day \"refused to give me a passport ... and I became quite reconciled with the idea that I was not going to leave\" (Lombardozzi 2003:325). Nkosi was in fact refused a passport to leave die country by die government, because \"my sin apparently was only to write against the government, bat I was not a political activist in die sense tiiat I recognised tiiat term\" (Nkosi 1994:5). It was mostiy due to me efforts of his friend, activist lawyer Harold Wolpe, tiiat he succeeded in actually leaving die country, by invoking the Departure From The Union of South Africa Regulatory Act of 1955.\n\nNkosi explains mat:\n\nit would have taken the Government changing the law by introducing a bill in Parliament - you know - for just one person who was not even an activist - except writing against apartheid - so in the end they decided that it was not worth it - give him the papers, but let him fuck off. And what you do is sign this piece of paper saying you agree you are not going to come back ... ever. (Lombardozzi 2003: 325)\n\nHowever, exile as die ultimate condition of loss, despite its disadvantages, curiously also often forges a new self-awareness and a new political consciousness. \"The solidarity wrested from\n\n(22)\n\n7\n\nstrategic separatism often leads to political activism and challenges social attitudes\" (Goldberg 2002:245). This realisation lies at the heart of Nkosi's work, which he uses as a lens retrospectively and almost exclusively focused on his continent of memory, the alienated home culture. The act of writing is for Nkosi a critical process; a cathartic experience in which he is able to confront his South African realities and through his literature, seeks to re-generate the self through reinventing and recreating a sense of a place called 'home.' Nkosi, as exile, discovered through his writing that a place existed which:\n\nis not economically or politically indebted to all the vileness and compromise. That is not obliged to reproduce the system. That is writing. If there is a somewhere that can escape the infernal repetition, it lies in that direction, where it writes itself, where it dreams, where it invents new worlds. (Goldberg 2002:184)\n\nThus Nkosi has not only remained in touch with his former society through his writing, but he has realised that in order to maintain a sharp focus on matters closest to his interest, he also needed to maintain the necessary distance from his homeland and other exiles. This is primarily because of the often neglected aspect of exile mentioned earlier in this chapter, that exile communities in their own right \"can be savagely self-destructive environments, unstable, riven with insecurity, suspicion, guilt, bitter rivalries and impotent anger, thus rendering the concept of home a fragile and precious resource, fought over all the more fiercely for being so\" (Gready 1994:511).\n\nCollapsing a memory of space and time into particular structures Of being, Berrnan suggests that the condition of exile is also a condition of modernity, reaching out across all human categories of place, belief systems and race. Modern man, as suggested by this idea of modernity, is in a perpetual state of transit, and it can be said that writers in exile produce a hybrid form of 'travel' writing.\n\n(Berrnan 1988:94). To this end Steven Clark believes that this form of writing projects a particular world view, and it is \"the ethics of inhabiting that alternative domains\" that are primarily at stake.\n\nIt would seem that postcolonial studies have drawn on this particular hybrid form of documentation and uphold it as a form of \"an exemplary record of cross-cultural encounters\" (Clark 1999:3) between the modern writer and the global community. To this view Urry adds his belief that\n\n\"modern systems generate quite novel forms of experience... rapid forms of mobility have radical effects on how people actually experience the modern world, indeed on the very production of subjectivity\" (Urry 1995:144). Urry also argues that the key aspect of mobility is that it aids the acculturalisation process, in that people are able through their visual consumption of place, a vision loaded with complicated memories and meanings, to evaluate their environment, both in historic and geographic terms, which in turn sharpens their awareness of their social conditions of existence.\n\n(23)\n\nThis awareness is more than evident in Nkosi's novels, where the characters are deeply receptive to their cultural, social and historical rootedness in their environment, and the effect this appropriation exerts on the formation of their social identities.\n\nEdward Said maintains that to be displaced always implies \"being a consciousness set apart from and unequal with its surroundings\" (Said 1989:157). This is an interesting observation also in terms of Nkosi's mobile intellect as a critical process, evident in his writing, in that he maintains a peculiar detachment from his immediate surroundings, mostly assuming the role of the observer rather than the resident, as his fiction is never about his immediate geopolitics, but largely draws upon the archives and memories of the home culture. Memory and recollection are in themselves interactive social acts, and together with the impulse of creating a new identity, may have therapeutic connotations. Nkosi seldom responds to the harsher and more abrasive aspects of his personal experience of exile, electing to eschew these in favour of displacing these sentiments onto some of his fictional characters. See for instance Nkosi's novel Underground People (2002), in which one of the main characters, Anthony Ferguson, gives voice to similar sentiments Nkosi himself has stated during interviews on his return to South Africa. At the same time though, his writing draws on and remains reliant upon imagery instilled through colonial influence, inscribing this ideology onto the formation of his identity through enforced exile. This is possibly explained using Lacan's notion that the displaced subject can never realise the dream of possession, as exile is always a disempowering state of being-in-the-world, most often fraught with poverty, limitations and obstructive pressures. Andrew Gurr offers an extensive polemic on the degrees of exile and the nature of the exiled identity. What is noteworthy about his discourse are not the similarities with other exile literature, but that his discussion clearly shows what an exiled writer such as Nkosi does not have in common with his South African contemporaries. Although Nkosi, when compared to other South African exiles, was not the norm, he does however share many commonalities and attributes with exiles such V.S.Naipaul, James Joyce, Chinua Achebe, Nuruddin Farah and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, who were all similarly displaced from their home environments, and who all have in common a particular identity: that of the writer. These writers all began their exiled lives as young adults, and created a sense of their own identity by making their 'home' in their Uteratore and fiction. Gurr develops this notion further, which is also a notion valid for Nkosi:\n\nthe creative exiles, those born in the Gemeinschaft [close-knit communities] and educated for the Gesellschdft [large individualistic societies] are a distinctive type of modern writer, who tend to write realistic prose fiction ... his concerns tend to be primarily social and only secondarily philosophical and cultural... the sense of elite art... and producing a body of work which essentially belongs, not to the metropolis, but to the country he was exiled from. (Gurr 1981:8)\n\n(24)\n\n9\n\nGurr's conclusion is evidenced in the writing of Nkosi, where the theme of exile not only touches on the personal and the cultural, but also on the process of artistic creation. His writing is hence not intrinsically preoccupied with cross-cultural narratives of encounter or simply about the exile who speaks through the texts detailing relations of domination and marginalisation. Although the leitmotif in his fiction is displacement, and the society he creates imaginatively in his fiction is a re- enactment of the values and conditions that were in place in the original order from which he was exiled, the purpose of his critical essays or fiction is much more than the sum of its colonial import.\n\nClark expands on this more broadly, when he explains that certain writing genres overlap with numerous other discourses of colonialism. He mentions discourses such as bureaucratic instruction and journalistie propaganda, amongst others, but more importantly states that a journey itself will\n\n\"encode inevitable ideological aspects, and is often a self-reflective pilgrimage, resonating with the writer's own culture. Narratives of exile do not preclude the experiences of curiosity and even pleasure, in the new circumstances\" (Clark 1999:3). It is also possible that, even though the exiled writer may construct a journey in order to uncover or rediscover the self, it also can \"suspend or even repudiate\" the authority of home (Clark 1999:5). Nkosi, writing from an exiled position, provides one of the main archives for investigating the colonising processes, as it \"reveals transactions of cultural and political power, a power supposedly always purchased at the expense of those imagined others who constitute the zone called elsewhere\" (Clark 1999:33). Pursuing this argument, Brian Musgrove observes that movement represents a critical moment for the identity of the mobile subject, and their writing always \"supplements the insufficient act of witnessing with epistemological reflection; a process which exposes fundamental morbidities in the ideologies of 'movement' and 'settlement'\" (Clark 1999:31). Said maintains that:\n\nthe double perspective of the exile who sees things both in terms of what has been left behind and what is actual here and now, is preferable to positing an interminable reiteration of the archive... you are always going to be marginal, and diat what you do as an intellectual has to be made up because you cannot follow a prescribed path. If you can experience that fete not as a deprivation ... but as a sort of freedom, a process of discovery in which you do tilings according to your own dictates: that is a unique pleasure. (Said 1994: 46)\n\nWhat has been omitted by Said here, is that the writing of displaced persons inevitably depict situations in which the stability of the self is often challenged. Theirs is an often ambivalent and disorientating world, because they are confronted with having to integrate new experiences set in extreme geographical and cultural differences. Exile creates a double perspective in that the exile is the outsider in the new home culture yet must live intimately with it.1\n\nSee for example Nkosi's arrival in, and experiencing of, New York mHome and Exile (1983:53-79).\n\n(25)\n\nThis line of thought will be further pursued in the next chapter which will look at Nkosi's experience as exile more closely. It is noticeable that most often, although the circumstances and ways in which individuals devolve into exiles may differ widely, the problems of displacement and challenges are often the same.\n\nAlthough there is little intimation of victhnhood in his writings, Nkosi's presentation of exile in his works lends itself to a postcolonial critique. Exile in Nkosi's writing can be read as a refusal of the coloniser, but at the same tune reflecting a sense of melancholy. This sense of nostalgia both stems from the separation from home in the pursuit of personal freedom, and being faced with an unfamiliar culture. Viewed from a postcolonial stance, the site of the exiled subject is a rite of passage; the condition of exile is a discourse configured primarily around distress and a disintegration of value and sense, the writing being a particular configuration of this knowledge and experience. This distress and bewilderment is expressed through the character of Anthony Ferguson in Underground People (2002) on his return to South Africa after a lengthy absence. \"He had the strangest sensation of floating in a pool of darkness, of being stranded like a fish out of water ...\n\nattacked by an uncomfortable feeling of complete displacement ...\"(Nkosi 2002:118). The act of displacement, the act of crossing over, represents a critical moment for the Dasein of the exiled subject, as movement away from the known is underscored by an anxious sense, mat to be in exile, is to be elsewhere and nowhere at the same time. This sentiment is confirmed by Bhabha, who writes that \"the movement across spatial boundaries challenges the stability of the subjective identity - it is always in relation to me place of me Other, that colonial desire is articulated\" (Bhabha 1994:186). What this implies is that the experience of forging a new cultural identity inclusive of the personal, the national, the ideological and the historical, is wholly dependent on the individoal's understanding and interpretation of his/her new cultural context. Bhabha, it would seem, advocates a move away from markers such as race, class and gender as primary conceptual categories, promoting rather the in-between spaces which are produced in the articulation of new strategies of selfhood as an alternative. Exile represents a subject that, according to Phillips:\n\nbelongs to no dialectic; that eludes the logic of identity. It- is a subject for wham the origin (or home) is from the beginning a displacement and thus cannot be fixed ...\n\nneither the identity nor the destination of the postcolonial traveller exists in advance of the diverse narratives of displacement, disorientation and alienation that emerge ... for postcolonialism, the very notion of home is undefinablc, at best an opening to an uncertain future. (Phillips in Clark 1999:68)\n\nThus it would seem that postcolonial theory suggests that the geographical displacement and\n\n(26)\n\n11\n\nexperiences of the exiled subject, in fact the collective conditions of existence for the exile are almost always situated within the context of confrontation and difference. Enigmatically so, Nkosi does not subscribe to the generic profile of Said's or Clark's postcolonial exiled subject, as the 'pleasure of discovery' is not evident in his works, as his fiction is almost exclusively focused on his South African past; nor is his situation one of perpetual confrontation, as despite the freedom to return to his country of birth, he has not articulated the wish to return. His ambivalence remains, which is clearly evinced in his introduction to Home and Exile (1983), when he states that there are no final answers, that his essays \"represent questions proposed to me by exile from my homeland ... and during some not entirely sorrowful wanderings in foreign countries\" (Nkosi 1965: vi).\n\nAlthough Nkosi shares many of the historieal actualities of exile with other displaced persons, he remains a writer who defies easy classification and critical placing. Nkosi's departure from South Africa was centrally motivated by the desire to be \"free from the lunacies of South Africa, ... to acquire private freedom\" (Nkosi 1965: viii). In attaining freedom, he could affirm to himself that he was no longer to be viewed \"first as a native and then as a servanf (Nkosi 2002:250) but finally as a human being with a purpose.\n\nUnlike the generic postcolonial exile writer, Nkosi, despite his isolation and the discontinuity of a South African self in the early stages of his exile, has firmly asserted his new self from the outset, providing his writing, whether factual or fictional, with a strong narrative voice steeped in sometimes acerbic wit, sometimes having an irascible ambience, sometimes reflecting a reserved humour, but finally a voice made possible through the interacting with other presences, languages, education and cultures. There is no obvious sense of Nkosi regarding himself as the 'Other' in his works, despite his stance as detached spectator at times. Rather, he has succeeded through his non- fiction writing in the main, to defy the stereotypical exile figure created by postcolonial thinking, aud has, through eschewing ethnic authenticities, provided himself with a fluid cosmopolitan identity, perhaps not only for himself, but potentially also for other Africans in the world.\n\nFor Nkosi, judging from his prolific writing, exile has been a source of creativity. He has clearly thrived on intermingled cultural and historical influences, a position which empowered him to claim victory over a malignant political system; his exile culminating in some ways in a celebration of the passing of a particular oppressive era in his life. He has transcended the state of exile to become the observer, acknowledging irreconcilable distance from what he can see, but no longer wants to possess. Nkosi's lack of involvement in remapping his immediate surroundings is perhaps explained by Clark's views on exile when he insists that the very fact of isolation paradoxically accentuates the exile's exemplary status as a representative social entity: \"it seems difficult to\n\n(27)\n\nreconcile with the prescribed path of expulsion by an occupying power, and the forthright individualism of this account of exile fails to consider the collectivity of displacement\" (Clark\n\n1999:12).\n\nDespite the many viewpoints subscribed to by the various theorists, the term 'exile' as mentioned earlier remains a problematic concept at best, as these labels tend to define perhaps too simplistically a social condition and a situation fraught with complex psychological implications, particularly because of the inescapable link to personhood and homeland, and the elusiveness of a return. The entities of home, homeland and identity are three major interlocking concepts intimately intertwined with exile which often add complexity to attempts at definition.\n\nThe concept of exile is thus, much like the exiled subject, a dynamic organism thriving on the interstices of the social and the political, and continuously re-interpreted and modified by the exiled subject. The term 'black exile' is avoided in this thesis as it implies an imposed racial and political marker, which is problematic and ambiguous in the sense that it presumes a unified conception of a homeland, of a group of people and shared values, whereas in fact this is not always so:\n\nI seem to recall instances when Africans met one another in Europe - and one thing that has to be said about this mutual discovery, is that it is both an ecstasy if you like, but it is also a partly tremendous irritation, irritation because some of your fellow Africans are not behaving exactly as the people you knew at home. (Nkosi in Stiebel and Gunner 2005:232)\n\nThe term 'exile' in this thesis is viewed in terms of the individual rather than the collective, Nkosi himself being an example of individualism and nonconformity in many respects. Clearly no two displaced people experience exile equally or uniformly as mentioned earlier, giving rise to the numerous and midtifaceted interpretations of this notion. Nkosi has himself offered numerous and often conflicting perspectives on exile. He has variously defined his exile as a \"shocking spectacle\"(Nkosi n.d :3), \" a complex fate,\" \"a strange fate,\" \"a cruel joke,\" a \"hard thing\"and \"not all pain\" (Nkosi 1963: ix; 1976:1, 1983:93) a condition whicli he ultimately acknowledged as a challenging exodus rather than a punishment, leading to new discoveries, relationships and experiences, and not all of these necessarily bad. In 1992 Nkosi attended the Africa Research and Information Bureau (ARIB) Conference in London, where the theme was African writers in exile and notions of the 'Homeland'. During this conference Nkosi argued that exile was indeed a painful reality, a physical as well as a spiritual condition, yet the writer in exile, unlike a refugee from a war or famine, was never given to loneliness [my emphasis]. This position was immediately challenged\n\n(28)\n\n13\n\nby those present, citing the testimonies of other exiles, such as David Diop and Arthur Nortje, and justly so, as Nkosi' s own writing, particularly his essays and fiction, often contradicts this statement.\n\nNkosi further argued that the nature of exile changed with each passing epoch, and that postcoloniality with its air of arrested hope was ultimately a condition of homelessness. It was \"the imminent loss of nation and purpose, which left the exile in permanent wandering and ambivalent anxiety\"( in ALA Bulletin 1992:27). This inherent ambivalence is also challenged by White, who comments that:\n\na common feature of many exiles..is ambivalence. Ambivalence towards the past and the present; as to whether things were better 'then' or 'now'. Ambivalence towards the future, whether to retain a myth of return or to design a new project ... Ambivalence towards the host society; feeling of respect, dislike or uncertainty ... whether to cling to the old or to discard it, whether to compromise... and since these situations change on a variety of temporal scales, so the identities expressed through attitude, behaviour and artifacts also change and may be marked by ambiguity, (in King 1995:4)\n\nWhite thus argues that an imposed state of exile, as in the case of Nkosi, often results in a consciousness torn between a sense of not belonging and a desire to belong to systems of interaction, these being the exile's community and linguistic group; this ambivalence hence \"forms the basis of the exilic consciousness, which can either choose to internalise exile as a rewarding adventure or a melancholy trauma of moral and spiritual abandonment5' (Nkosi 1994:5). Nkosi admits that exile is an ambivalent space; he has: \"a split mind about the notion of exile. I reject it because there is the immediate tendency to self dramatise or to self-pity. It's a very sterile category to be fitted into ... and for writers, artists and academics severance and displacement from home are not always without self-serving moments\" (5). Said, as seen earlier, also refutes the belief held by some that exile is a condition of loss and comments that:\n\nif true exile is a condition of terminal loss, why has it been transformed so easily into a potent, even enriching motif of modern culture ... modern Western culture is in large part the work of exiles, emigres, refugees ... exile has its pleasures, not the least which is the particular sense of achievement one derives from acting as if one were at home wherever one happens to be. (Said 1994:137,148)\n\nThis astute observation is pertinently relevant to Nkosi.\n\nEven though many exiles might regard their leaving as a temporary condition rather than a\n\n(29)\n\npermanent solution, as was the case with many of the black South African exiles who left as a consequence of political persecutions at the time, repatriation is never the natural outcome of displacement. Unlike most exiles, Nkosi's own departure from South Africa is not followed by the inevitable wished for return; he has never 'returned', except on recent brief visits, to his native soil.\n\nThis is a factor which sets displaced individuals apart, as their desire to return often depends on the degree of their cultural and social transformation and their status in the new non - home community.\n\nNkosi freely admits that, with hindsight his own experience of exile: \"in spite of great deprivation, has never been one of relentless, unmitigated suffering,\" as, having survived apartheid, \"I was already an exile before I knew i f (Nkosi 1994:5).\n\nThe above is critical to this discussion in terms of Nkosi's own enforced displacement and dislocation. In his own words, \"exile is not all pain... and in the end brought me face to face with a self whose emergence would have been inconceivable had I stayed in South Africa\" (Nkosi 1965:\n\nviii). In my view, Nkosi's statement transforms the negative nuances of the term 'exile' into a more affirmative notion, a notion which has as one of its many connotations, the archaic Latin root ex (out) and salira, which means 'to leap'. It is perhaps this archaic sense which appeals to Nkosi's subconscious thinking; revealed in his writing is the sense that exile for him meant propelling himself beyond the boundaries set by colonial and postcolonial alterity, literally springing into a new life. His homeland is no longer seen as a negative space but is itself transformed into a platform from which he can launch himself into a life of renewed possibility. His leaving, although initially mtimidating, was perhaps not to begin a sentence of expulsion, but rather to initiate a lifelong Odyssey, a liberation which has taken him beyond the invisible boundaries of possession and belonging, to acquire a new understanding of what constitutes home and exile for himself. As he was later to admit in defence of the vagaries of exile, \"new spaces are also an arena for forging new identities\" (Nkosi in Stiebel and Gunner 2005:242). In order to make sense of his exile, Nkosi chose to view his enforced state of in-betweenness and transition as a place of possibilities, where change and empowerment could be attained. This delineation of his temporal space has empowered him to take possession of a new world of knowing that operates within ideas of memory, where his horizon has not been limited by the spirit of arrival nor the spectre of departure. It is thus possible to leave on a one-way exit permit and prefer not to return home. Perhaps it is possible to return for a visit after a period of absence of thirty years, as Nkosi did, only to find that home is not all that one had hoped for, that home is no longer the structure that memory conceived: \"All those are new things they have put up there which are horrific ... and all the smells, and seeing how parts of Durban, that were out of bounds for people like myself when I was growing up - suddenly seeing how they are being occupied by a new army\" (242).\n\n(30)\n\n15\n\nNkosi has, since leaving South Africa, elected to remain 'homeless.' Although he now holds both a British and a South African passport, he has been a temporary sojourner wherever he has happened to be. He has not expressed a clear desire to return to his country of birth, now this is possible. Perhaps he knows from personal experience that it is possible to return, and yet never fully arrive. In Nkosi's case, he is able to return but chooses not to arrive, preferring rather to dream of, and imagine a glorious return enacted through his characters. However, Nkosi has found this 'glorious' return to be elusive, a truth which he freely admits to and is illustrated vividly in his works of fiction and in interviews: \"I had dreamed of course, of some final return in the future ... 1 had even prefigured and imaginatively staged that final return... but it was an anti-climax ... we had left as South Africans, and we were now returning as foreigners\" (Nkosi n.d: 4). The inherent ambivalence which almost negates any possibility of a return for Nkosi is embodied in his character Anthony Ferguson, for whom \"the drama of departure was yielding at last to the miserable prospect of another drama of arrival\" (Nkosi 2002:24). Thus for Nkosi as exile, home is neither here nor there, but any place, temporary and movable, carried in the memory and by acts of imagination.\n\nNkosi locates himself both synesthetically and synecdochially: township music or the sight of a verdant mountain valley he will acknowledge feed his memories of the past and his narratives of the imagination, yet he denies having any notions of heimatism (Lombardozzi in conversation with Lewis Nkosi 2003). He is able to transit back and forth on brief visits, electing to be the perennial nomad, simultaneously in exile everywhere and yet nowhere, the globalised traveller, his personal diaspora now devoid of alienation and difference, possibly because he may have had a well- developed inner sense of identity, leaving South Africa as a motivated and educated young man, albeit partly apprehensive of the future. This point will be fully explored in Chapter Two.\n\nReturning to one's country of origin is not always a desirable solution, as re-establishment and effective reintegration are often as traumatising as leaving the homeland as an exile. This thought resonates throughout Nkosi's novel Underground People (2002) and is clearly discernable in the inner turmoil of Ferguson's thoughts who is about to return to his homeland after an absence of fifteen years. He thoughts are dissembled into a \"feeling of"
