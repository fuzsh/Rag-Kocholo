        "text": "Description\n\nThis is one of the best books to have come out of South Africa in recent times …This absorbingly fine novel is a leafed score of reflection and sardonic wit as well as a gripping page-turner.\n\nThis much-awaited second novel, following Nkosi’s awardwinning Mating Birds, is a tour de force of crafted writing. Nkosi takes us to mansions and mountain hideouts, where we meet a dazzling variety of characters: the serene Princess Madi, Kristina the small-town temptress and Joe Blane, the sinister Central Committee man. Switching from comedy to sensitive observation to action and back, there are no dull patches in this complex plot. In Underground People ‘the struggle’ is the story.\n\nWith its double-dealing operatives and political shenanigans, Underground People brings elements of a political thriller into a sophisticated human drama – a sparkling new addition to South African writing on the apartheid era."
