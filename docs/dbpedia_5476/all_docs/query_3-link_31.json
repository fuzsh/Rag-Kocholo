        "text": "EXAMINE RHYTHM OF VIOLENCE AS A PLAY OF ITS TIME\n\nAUGUST 2018.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRhythm of of violence is a play written by Lewis Nkosi (1936-2010), born in Embo, KwaZulu-natal, South Africa. He was a South African writer who attempted all genre of literature, from poetry to drama, short stories, essays and journalism.\n\nNkosi’s works were banned under the suppression of communism Act due to the issues that his works touched. He thereafter exiled himself according to the apartheid laws.\n\nRhythm of violence was staged in 1963 in London, was published in 1964 and gained significant praise for its a ability to depict a typical apartheid situation using its characters.\n\nThe preoccupation of this drama is simply apartheid. If one must examine this drama as a play of its time, the segregation in South Africa will be the major theme of the discussion. Apartheid according to Wikipedia l, ‘was the system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It involved the supremacy of the whites, dictation of housing, schooling, and employment by race. There was a prohibition of mixed marriages and those who relocated where at the risk of loosing their citizenship.\n\nApartheid sparked domestic and international oppositions. Such opposition is illustrated by the students club headed by Gama in the play.\n\nThe purpose of this work is to examine the play and relate it to the time setting used by Lewis Nkosi. Obviously, with the traits of apartheid and separation evident in the play, it will be noted that Rhythm of Violence is a tool for exposing the events that took place between 1948 to the early 1990s and how the black South Africans struggled for equality and the end of racism which was even extreme.\n\nAPARTHEID IN THE PLAY\n\nThe title of this book is used metaphorically by Gama in page twenty five to denote the plan of the students to end apartheid by explosion of bombs to kill the perpetrators of racism. To say Rhythm of Violence as a play of its time will simply mean relating the play to the south African apartheid and how it relates the events of that time.\n\nThe play opens in Johannesburg City Hall where Gama is urging the audience to stand up for their rights and refuse to be under the oppression of the whites who feel superior to those born with black skin. Outside the hall is a room where two soldiers are waiting to strike at the blacks if they make any violent vattempt to protest against the oppression. The presence of Jan and Piet mirrors the lack of privacy at the time. The blacks are open to insecurity and murder without intervention by the Government. The whites are waiting for all opportunities to attack them.\n\n‘Black Sam’s! Why don’t they do something so we can handle this once and for all! They’re wearing me down!’ This is the statement made by Piet, one of the soldiers guarding the blacks says. The scene illustrates lack of freedom of speech for the blacks because in.a situation where soldiers are guarding the floors of unarmed blacks who should have a right to privacy, the opinions members would have voiced out will be swallowed for fear of the white man’s gun.\n\nThe black South Africans are insulted their skin colour and even mocked. Tula is called Kaffir by the soldiers and in mockery and disgust, both soldiers try to imagine waking up to see that they have become black.\n\nVIOLENCE IN THE PLAY\n\nThe most dominant theme in this play is that of violence. It is evident from the first scene of the play. The jazz music played as the stage is introduced, suggests violence and in a way, foreshadows the events that will take place in the play. This connotes the real South African environment whose music has the rhythm of violence because the country has an history of violent events.The voice at the beginning of the play speaking to the crowd is powerful, inciting consciousness and readiness of for war in the minds of the audience. Gama tells the people to raise their voices and stop being silent towards the trampling of their rights and freedoms. This scene can be likened to various movements in reality which was geared towards the end of apartheid such as the communists movements, Marxist movements etc. which were to establish economic, personal and group freedom the black race. These movements resulted in clashes between their rivalries and so is it seen in the play where the. Gama-led movement is Stirling up internal and physical crisis.\n\nIt is violence that brings about the name of the play and the ideas governing the students club in the play. The language of of play us violent itself like in used by Gama in Act two; ‘And boom! There’ll be a mighty explosion…’ This gives a highlight to the manner of speech of the South African especially during the oppression.\n\nThe violence in South Africa also leads to death of both loved ones and those who the violence is directed at as fate may have it. A similar case is the Sharpeville massacre that took place in the 1960s where the blacks went for a peaceful protest at the police station, unarmed but the police officers opened fire on them, causing about sixty nine deaths and hundreds of injured people including children. Such event is illustrated by the character- Tula who with the true intention to save Sarie’s father, dies after the bomb meant for the white oppressors also explodes on him unfortunately.\n\nSarie’s father death signifies that there are whites in SouthAfrica who at a point, does not support the apartheid course for its inhumanity. Some of them in the course of disassociating from the movement, get involved in tragic events just like Sarie’s father.\n\nViolence has to be compensated by people who will sacrifice their lives, time and resourcesto gain freedom. Such people are the likes of Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu etc. Gama, Tula Sarie’s father and some other characters in the play play the sacrificial role. Tula and Sarie’s father pays the ultimate price which is to die for their race. Their death brings a denouement to the play and freedom to all.\n\nINTER MARRIAGE/ASSOCIATION\n\nInter marriage and association is a serious issue in South Africa. By thus, we mean that the blacks are not permitted by the apartheid law to associate or marry the whites because they are regarded as inferior beings. As told by Johozi, ‘A Boer girl and a Bantu boy were found in compromising circumstances last nigh. They were both taken into custody….’ It perfectly illustrates the colour bar in South Africa and there is some fear for Tula and Sarie when they begin to fall in love.\n\nThe play shows the longing within the youths to f these races to bridge the Colour bar which is set by the white elderly men.The youths themselves are free and unbiased but the white elders do not want to feel equal with the blacks such that, they make sure the apartheid rule is binding on all, using the armed forces to implement the course.\n\nCONSCIENCE IN THE MIDST OF VIOLENCE\n\nRhythm of Violence illustrates the good consciences of the blacks as against that of the whites. Though the black students are planning a massive attack at the City Hall, their conscience of good and bad, right and wrong does not leave them. Tula is seen as the conscience of the play as he pays a huge sacrifice for listening to his conscience. He is described by Gama as ‘My chubby little brother! Perhaps he’s having a little ‘crisis of conscience’!’ perhaps, because of their culture. The students confess that they are all nervous, even in class, they can only think about the event that will take place at night. ‘What if it won’t explode?’. ‘Will they be hurt? I mean will many people be hurt?’ Kitty asks. Thus explains the innocence and good hearts of the black people, showing that they do not have much of violent tendencies naturally but are only influenced by their societies and segregation by the whites. In reality, the South African blacks are are full of good consciences because they have an option of killing the whites without hesitation in order to gain freedom for their father land but they choose peace rather than war. Though the blacks sometimes venture into inhumane things, the written makes it clear that such actions are not innate in them but only acquired and theyare not even free because they suffer from guilt of conscience.\n\nThis is unlike the whites as depicted in the play. They feel all unequals should remain strictly unequal and to maintain the status quo, force has to be used on the black folks. Killing them is natural and necessary. Jan describes killing a black man to be like ‘shooting wild ducks!’ How insolent and inhumane! A human being should never be compare to a lower animal but the black South Africans at the time of apartheid suffered disregard and other sorts of segregation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe apartheid system in South Africa led to the death of many South Africans especially those who fought against the racial system and even the innocent who did not play any role. Associations like the Liberal Party whose aim was to crumble the racial system were frustrated till the went into extinction. The play illustrates the typical South African apartheid environment, fore shadows the future by way of role playing and even suggests the way apartheid will end through the bomb explosion and sacrificial death of Tula and Sarie who die for both races to salvage the situation."
