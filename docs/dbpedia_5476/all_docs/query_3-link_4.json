        "text": "Lewis Nkosi (1936-2010): An Appreciation\n\nby\n\nNtongela Masilela\n\nLewis Nkosi, who passed away on September 5, 2010 (Sunday) at the Johannesburg Wellness Clinic after a prolonged declining health, will undoubtedly be remembered in many years to come as one of the truly outstanding literary critics Africa has been privileged to have had in the twentieth century. Although he was a novelist of note in his later years (The Mating Birds [1986], Underground People [2002], Mandela’s Ego [2006]) and a respectable playwright in his middle period (The Rhythm of Violence [1964], The Black Psychiatrist [1978] as well as a budding poet in his early [“To Herbert Dhlomo”, Ilanga lase Natal, October 22, 1955; in his whole life he wrote seven poems, the last one written in Lusaka in the early 1980s where he was then living and published at that time in Sechaba, the political and cultural review of the African National Congress], it was through his formidable critical imagination that he dazzled his contemporaries from Christopher Okigbo (1932-1967) to Ngugi wa Thiong’o (1938- ) as well as those generations who followed in his wake represented by Mbulelo Mzamane (1948- ) and Njabulo Ndebele (1948- ). Not to be forgotten is the fact that he was a brilliant essayist who was fascinated by the Germanic essay form represented by Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and György Lukács. This is not to deny that he had a passion for the African American essay as created by master practitioners such as James Baldwin (Notes of a Native Son [1955], Nobody Knows My Name [1961], The Fire Next Time [1963]) and Ralph Ellison (Shadow and Act [1964]).\n\nThis appreciation of European and American intellectual culture mediated within the cultural splay of the New African Movement resulted in his most renowned work of literary criticism and appreciation: Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (1981). All of this makes clear that Lewis Nkosi’s critical and historical imagination was forged by the coordinates that emphasized the future against the past, valorized the outside and devalued the inside process: in other words, he believed that modernity must be created at the expense of tradition rather than as a dialectical structure of the dialogical process. He seemed to have believed that culture is a constant and perpetual reinvention in the present disconnected from the lineages of the past. The consequences of this philosophy of history will be apparent in a moment.\n\nLewis Nkosi’s forte for the essay form was evident in his first collection of essays and newspaper articles assembled in Home and Exile (1965) that were made possible by his long foray into literary journalism in many newspapers and journals in Africa and in Europe: Drum, Ilanga lase Natal, Golden City Post, Transition, The Guardian, Africa Report, Afro-Asian Writings, Sechaba, New Society, Spectator, New Statesman, The Observer, Negro Digest, Black Orpheus, Fighting Talk, Contact, The African Guardian, Southern African Review of Books, London Review of Books, Genèva-Afrique, The New African, Harvard Crimson, and probably other publications in Poland where he lived for extended periods in the 1980s. This forte was inherited from arguably the master of the essay form in the history of the New African Movement, whom the nineteen-year old Lewis Nkosi celebrated in the pages of Ilanga lase Natal and began his column “Life As I See It” in 1955 when the unattributed weekly columns of his master (“Busy Bee” and “X”) cease publication because of terminal illness, yet in subsequent years never mentioned him at all: this was H. I. E. Dhlomo. In his budding years he expressed his admiration for the great intellectual in the elegy “To Herbert Dhlomo”:\n\nH. I. E., H. I. E.,\n\nMe and all my brothers dark,\n\nThose that mumble in the dust,\n\nWithout a hope, without a joy,\n\nStreaked with tears for ravaged Africa\n\nHave, with thy silence, ceased to live.\n\nIn vain we seek the lost dream to regain,\n\nIn vain the vision yet to capture:\n\nThe Destiny of a Thousand, million dark folk\n\nWho seek, who yearn---Alas! A fruitless toil.\n\nH. I. E., H. I. E.,\n\nSpeak to us again;\n\nWhisper thoughts yet to impower us\n\nTo live the Dream, to live the Vision\n\nOf a free Africa over again.\n\nLewis Nkosi’s unrelenting and unwavering commitment to modernity was based on his belief that this was the only way to create and construct the “Dream and Vision of a Free Africa”. This possible lived experience required the perpetual re-invention of the new. This could be taken to have been the philosophical credo of the Drum journalists and photographers of the Sophiatown Renaissance.\n\nLewis Nkosi arguably went the furthest in the belief that the re-invention of the new should be anchorless and disconnected from the past. He reveled in the accelerated temporality of modernity in the direction of the future. This explains his fearlessness of the future and of “the Other”. “The Other” was understood in the multiplicity of its possible permutations: be it Joseph Conrad, or Ernest Hemingway, or African American jazz, or the Jewish woman, or European cultural space: all these were forms of the new or the allowable. Concerning the dialectic or the binary between modernity and tradition: Lewis Nkosi believed at the most in the tradition of the new and sought to banish from South African intellectual and cultural landscape the tradition of the past. Witness the most celebrated or rivaled critical writing ever penned by our premier literary critic that originally appeared in Africa Report magazine (“African Fiction Part I: South Africa: Protest”, October 1962 and “African Fiction: Part II: English-Speaking West Africa”, December 1962) in which he banished a swath of African literature from aesthetic worthiness because its supposed obsequiousness to the tradition of the past rather than valorization of the tradition of the new. With this bifurcation or demarcation, Lewis Nkosi dismissed the literary work of many of his contemporaries within the Sophiatown Renaissance, even dismissing African literature in the African languages by the literary giants of the previous constellations of the New African Movement (S. E. K. Mqhayi, J. J. R. Jolobe, Thomas Mofolo) through confusion with “Vernacular literature” which was belaboring in the 1950s under Apartheid edicts producing pulp literature for Primary School children. But it must be remembered that Lewis Nkosi was writing a few months after the also equally famous or infamous Conference of 1962 by Writers of English Expression that took place in Kampala sponsored by Transition magazine in which African literature in the African languages was delegitimized from articulating the modernist literary experience. Nkosi was an active participant at this Conference where he begun interviewing contemporary African writers for his famous London based “Writers’ Talk Series”.\n\nWith the publication of Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (1981), Lewis Nkosi was universally acclaimed as a premier scholar and literary critic of African literature. This brilliant book was the actualization of his philosophy of literary criticism that he later outlined in his Inaugural Lecture on assuming a Chair in the Department of Literature at the University of Zambia in June 1983:\n\nIn short, I would like to defend a cultural practice, a critical activity, a\n\ndiscursive practice whose object is literature. I want to say, and I am\n\ngoing to say, that to study literature may be dangerous but that it is\n\nworthwhile, that it is important and a productive activity which should\n\nbe encouraged rather than discouraged; that even if we were\n\nparsimonious enough to curtail the study of literature in our academic\n\ninstitutions it is difficult to see how critical discourse on a purely\n\ninformal level could be prevented from taking place outside the\n\nuniversities, in the street or in bars, in whatever attenuated form, since\n\nthe appearance of any work of literature or its performance is an act of\n\nprovocation, an insertion of a material object into the world, which leads\n\nnaturally to its scrutiny, appraisal, assimilation or denunciation by the\n\npublic . . . To ask what value has literature is to ask a related question.\n\nDoes society need writers? On the surface of it, this is a strange question\n\nbecause no one ever asks whether or not we need historians. The reason\n\nwhy this question is never put to historians is presumably because what\n\nhistorians retail is taken to be fact; and this facility is not assumed to be\n\nadmirable for its own sake as an accumulation of knowledge, it is also\n\nwhat gives history the status of an evidence which a society or its\n\nfactions need in moments of conflicts or disputes. Before an international\n\ncourt historical evidence can be produced in self-justification or for the\n\napportionment of guilt. In the arbitration of border disputes no one ever\n\ngoes to a novel or a poem for evidence. Literature, on the other hand, it\n\nis generally supposed, cannot do much more than entertain us and\n\nperhaps stimulate in us an aesthetic pleasure. Nevertheless, modern\n\nscholarship disputes this facile demarcation not only between literature\n\nand history, but between literature as such and other resources. Not only\n\nis literature a valuable source of information upon which the other\n\nhuman sciences can bring to bear their various disciplines and\n\nmethodologies but history, sociology, anthropology and philosophy are\n\nthemselves species of literature; they are particular types of discourse, a\n\nset of discursive practices bearing upon the same reality, sometimes\n\nusing the very tropes and strategies that were supposed to be the\n\ndistinguishing features of literature. The discourses of Foucault, Levi-\n\nStrauss, Lacan, Althusser and Derrida, abolish any space between\n\nliterature and anthropology, between political enquiry and history . . .\n\nLiterature is a broad category, containing within its boundaries many\n\nwriting practices, but even when narrowly conceived to mean only its\n\nimaginative form, literature not only provides us with timely critiques of\n\nsociety, but fleshes out for us in concrete images the ‘lived experiences’\n\nof men and women who are the human subjects in historical process.\n\nWhen I say literature ‘fleshes out’ this lived experience I do not wish to\n\nbe understood as saying that novels or drama simply duplicate\n\nexistence, that they provide knowledge of reality by reflecting it\n\nphotographically. To quote Theodor Adorno, ‘in art knowledge is\n\naesthetically mediated through and through’.\n\n(“In Defence of the Study of Literature” by Lewis Nkosi. Professorial\n\nInaugural Lectures No. 2, University of Zambia, 1997).\n\nThis grappling with the meaning of literature and the discursive practices that seek to illuminate the complexity of meaning, content and form that inhere in the literariness of its object, is comparable to the great essays H. I. E. Dhlomo wrote on literary theory in various scholarly journals in the late 1930s. Both of these instances of the 1930s and 1980s represent some of the high moments of reflection on the philosophy of artistic form within the history of the New African Movement.\n\nThis understanding of the philosophy of form in literature is based on a literary critical practice Lewis Nkosi promulgated two decades earlier in a review of Wole Soyinka’s ‘big novel’ The Interpreters (1966):\n\nIn his first novel, The Interpreters, the Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka\n\nhas given us the nearest approach we have yet had in Africa to a big\n\nnovel. The panoramic sweep of this book, with its multitude of\n\ncharacters, its energy, and its grinding pace, has not been matched by\n\nany other English-speaking African novelist. I include, of course, Chinua\n\nAchebe who is, in many ways, a more controlled and more finished,\n\nthough also more conventional, writer. The Interpreters is by no means a\n\nwholly successful novel. It is, however, a book written by a man\n\nprepared to push his ambition, talent, and language---the instrument of\n\nhis craft---as far as they can stretch to serve his purpose. At the center of\n\na multitude of characters are “the interpreters”---a small circle of young\n\nNigerians who grew up as close friends and fellow boozers. After\n\nleaving the university to go their separate ways, they still meet from\n\ntime to time as intellectuals-in-arms to drink and whore together and to\n\nconceptualize traditional and modern Nigerian. There is no recognize\n\nplot in this sprawling work. Apparently it is planned as a number of set\n\nscenes with dialogue, an adaptation of Soyinka’s dramatic techniques.\n\nReinforcing this format are some atmospheric descriptive passages and\n\nlarge dashes of a Joycean stream-of-consciousness. Soyinka manages,\n\nnevertheless, to let his characters interpret modern Nigeria and also at a\n\ndeeper level, Yoruba tradition . . . The Interpreters has some very obvious\n\nshortcomings which impair the total impact. A sense of form is almost\n\nnon-existent. There are episodes certainly; there are characters; there is\n\nenergy and vitality---but to what end? There seems to have been some\n\nidea in Soyinka’s mind of using a painting of “the group” by one of its\n\nmembers as some kind of central framework pulling the strands of the\n\nbook. If so, it did not come off. An even more serious flaw stems from\n\nwhat, at first sight, might be viewed as his particular strength. I mean, of\n\ncourse, his play with the English language. The vitality in his use of\n\nlanguage reflects Soyinka’s restless intelligence and this is a laudable\n\nquality in a novelist. The problem is that often there is a gap between\n\nthought and language. Either the ideas are not there or there is confusion\n\nabout their precise rendering. At any rate, Soyinka tends to want to\n\nappear more profound than he actually is; too often, he uses verbal\n\npyrotechnics to try to give his lines the necessary depth when profundity\n\nof ideas is lacking. This results in imprecision or more often a ludicrous\n\npomposity . . . Wole Soyinka obviously has some of the qualities of James\n\nJoyce, and may one day even warrant bracketing with the old master. But\n\nthe English critic who put Soyinka as his present stage of development in\n\nthe same category as Joyce is surely premature. This kind of silly\n\nuncritical adulation does Soyinka a disservice. He should be encouraged\n\nto grow . . . Where does African literature go from here? After the initial\n\nexcitement about any African who could put two sentences together,\n\ncritics are going to harden toward African books and treat them like any\n\nwriting from anywhere in the world. Already the Africans themselves\n\nand foreign scholars working intelligently in African universities have\n\nbegun to sort out the aristocracy of creative talent from hack writers\n\ndrawn to writing only by the attractions of instant publication.\n\n(“Where Does African Literature Go From Here?” by Lewis Nkosi, Africa\n\nReport, December 1966.)\n\nWhat is remarkable about this review of African novels published in 1966 is the wide spectrum of authors it encompasses in its analytical sweep: The Second Round by Lenrie Peters, Efuru by Flora Nwapa, No Easy Task by Aubrey Kachwinge, The Voice by Gabriel Okara, Houseboy by Ferdinand Oyono, A Few Nights and Days by Mbella Sonne Dipoko, Toads for Supper by Chukwuemeka Ike, A Man of the People by Chinua Achebe, and The Interpreters by Wole Soyinka. This essay itself could be taken as demarcating that serious literary criticism in postcolonial Africa by Africans themselves had begun with the utmost urgency. Although his name is not mentioned at all, this review in many ways was self-conscious that these books were being published in the context of political instability that Frantz Fanon had so prophetically predicted in his posthumous book The Wretched of the Earth (1961, 1965).\n\nIn ‘postcolonial’ South Africa, the indefatigable mind of our foremost literary critic was equally busy analyzing and reflecting on the political inequalities of cultural production in a “New South Africa”. In anticipation of the historic changes that were to occur 1994, in the Introduction to the 1990 Penguin edition of Bloke Modisane’s autobiography Blame Me On History, which was originally published in 1963, Lewis Nkosi defined the fundamental nature of the problem of cultural politics that a ‘changed’ South Africa will be forced to confront:\n\nA serious examination of South African culture must at some time come\n\nto terms with a fact which may be uncongenial to both black and white\n\nprogressives, given our prior commitment to a nonracial democratic\n\nfuture; and that fact is the near total hegemony within the various\n\ncultural practices of South African society of an unrepresentative white\n\nhegemony, consisting not only of diehard upholders of the apartheid\n\nsystem but also of white liberals and progressives as academics, as\n\ncritics, as anthologists.\n\nNearly two decades after these words were written, their prescient nature still remain incontestable. This can only indicate or prove that Lewis Nkosi was a superlative cultural critic.\n\nSince Lewis Nkosi alignment himself with the tradition of the new in negation of the tradition of the past, he was incapable of providing solutions to this historical conundrum.\n\nWe South Africans owe it to his everlasting memory to resolve this contradiction or antinomy by historically integrating the tradition of the new and the tradition of the past into a new synthetic whole.\n\nHaving said all this, one needs to conclude by noting and acknowledging that although Lewis Nkosi rarely made overt political statements about our situation, especially in his writings, he possessed a complex political imagination as evident in this brilliant portrait of Robert Sobukwe written a few months after leaving South Africa for exile in 1961, in all probability written while he was still holding a one-year Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University:\n\n. . . Who is this man who so nearly paralyzed the country? What is his\n\nclaim to political power and leadership, and what is his future in this\n\nperplexing country where power and influence in the black community\n\nhave never been constant? . . . His moral ire has been provoked, for\n\nexample, by “wasteful living” among upper echelon politicians, who\n\nspend their valuable time “dancing with white women in the\n\nJohannesburg interracial parties instead of getting down to the job of\n\nfreeing Africa from white domination”. [Lewis Nkosi is quoting directly\n\nfrom an interview conducted with Robert Sobukwe for a political\n\nportrait which was originally intended for the Golden City Post in\n\nJohannesburg, a weekly sister newspaper of Drum magazine; but in the\n\nevent appeared in a London monthly] . . . Although the Defiance\n\nCampaign made a tremendous impact on the white population and\n\nindirectly caused the formation of Alan Paton’s Liberal Party, the\n\ncampaign was crushed by the government and therefore failed in its\n\nmain objective. After the collapse of the Defiance Campaign, a number\n\nof white dissidents formed the Liberal Party and others farther to the left\n\nfounded the Congress of Democrats. Some members of the COD were\n\nrefugees from the Communist Party, which had recently been\n\nsuppressed by government legislation. The ANC and the Indian\n\nNational Congress thereafter joined hands with the Congress of\n\nDemocrats and the South African Coloured Peoples’ Organization\n\n(mixed-bloods) in what is now popularly known as the Congress\n\nAlliance. It was at this time, too, that the extreme nationalistic wing of\n\nthe ANC began to chafe against the party leadership. Stories began to\n\nfilter to the press that Sobukwe was waging a minor war within the\n\nCongress movement. It was not clear in the beginning what the issues\n\nwere, but by the latter 1950’s, just before Sobukwe’s ultimate break with\n\nthe movement, some of these main issues had emerged clearly enough\n\nto become a matter of public debate. By this time, Robert Sobukwe was\n\nno longer teaching in the sleepy village of Standerton. He had joined the\n\nfaculty of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, and was\n\ntherefore near the center of the storm. One day in 1958, after the\n\nnewspapers had for weeks been printing stories of Sobukwe’s\n\nmaneuvers inside the ANC, I was entrusted, as a chief political reporter\n\nof my newspaper, with the task of tackling him for a series of interviews\n\non his political activities. Specifically, I was to find out the nature of his\n\nconflict with the official leadership of the ANC and his intentions if\n\nthese differences persisted . . . Why does Sobukwe object so\n\nuncompromisingly to the Marxian analysis of the South African\n\nsituation? First, he is wary of any organization that seems to be speaking\n\nin a foreign voice. He is seeking to activate the African masses as a\n\n“corporate group,” sharing an identity of a certain history of\n\ndisenfranchisement, against the privileged white minority. He sees the\n\nstruggle, therefore, as inevitably between black and white in South\n\nAfrica . . . Although the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC}---which\n\nSobukwe formed in 1958 after he finally left the ANC altogether---would\n\nnot admit whites to its membership, he contends that the organization is\n\nnot racialistic. “We stand for equal rights for all individuals. But the\n\nwhites have to accept allegiance to Africa first; once a truly non-racial\n\ndemocracy exists in South Africa, all individuals, whatever their color or\n\nrace, will be accepted as Africans. Naturally, we cannot put the cart\n\nbefore the horse. We have to realize that at the moment the struggle is\n\nbetween a white minority and the oppressed black majority.” It is\n\ndifficult to make an impartial evaluation of Sobukwe. He is not the\n\nracialist some ANC leaders have charged that he is. However, the tactics\n\nhe is using for strategic reasons encourage chauvinism and, ultimately\n\nperhaps, genuine racialism. It seems to me that this strategy is a very\n\ndangerous one . . . The paradox of the South African situation is that a\n\nman like Albert Luthuli of the ANC would make the best Prime\n\nMinister---but he is not revolutionary enough to lead the oppressed to\n\nfreedom. On the other hand, Sobukwe has the militancy to lead a\n\nrevolution---but he is too rigid to create the necessary organizational\n\ninstrument. The white men and women whom Sobukwe so deeply\n\ndistrusts are some of those who have fought most bravely and often at\n\ngreat personal risks against the Verwoed regime. While Luthuli can,\n\nwith his great flexibility, command the sympathy of even the most\n\nconservative elements among the white populace without giving ground\n\non essentials, Sobukwe alienates even those liberals from whom he has\n\nleast to fear. Yet, with all these faults, he still remains an imposing figure\n\nin South African politics.\n\n(“Robert Sobukwe: An Assessment”, Africa Report, April 1962.)\n\nGiven this dazzling assessment of the political personality of Robert Sobukwe, written at a very turbulent moment in our political history, one can only speculate that his imagination, like that of H. I. E. Dhlomo and also of other outstanding New African intellectuals, was endlessly fascinated by ideas and inimical to ideologies of any kind.\n\nIn following on this intellectual tradition, Lewis Nkosi has bestowed on us who come after him an extraordinary legacy of continuity through transformation and inventiveness.\n\nClaremont [Los Angeles], California, September 7th and 8th, 2010."
