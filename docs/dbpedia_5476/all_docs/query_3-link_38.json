        "text": "Lewis Nkosi’s novel, Mating birds (1986) offers a significant intervention in a history as dispersed and fragmented as South Africa’s, by focusing on those specific and critical episodes of South Africa’s past. This much-colonised country has had an extended history of perennial violence under colonialism and apartheid Some fiction by Black writers on this phenomenon may be seen to be reactive, what Njabulo Ndebele (South African writer) terms ‘Protest Literature’-and seeks to show black people as victims (Ndebele 1994). Nkosi’s novels, Mating birds (1986) in particular reverse this order through the narratives of different characters, illustrating that black people were not the passive victims of apartheid but played an active role towards its opposition and eradication. This is achieved through complex portrayal of the first-person narrative technique and interstices of memory and recall. This article explores how identity as a porous and fluid, and fragmented and fractured concep...\n\nSouth African white minority rulers implemented racial discrimination on the basis of colour also known as apartheid. Lewis Nkosi was a South African Black who fought against apartheid through writings. He was a critic, essayist, and novelist. His first novel Mating Birds is the story of an educated Black youth’s narration of his life. Ndi Sibiya, the narrator is awaiting death for the alleged rape of a white girl with whom he claims to have a muted love affair across the segregated beach. The narration is an attack on apartheid, the political system and judiciary. Nkosi uses existentialist and postmodernist techniques to present the story. This paper attempts to examine Mating Birds as an invective against apartheid.\n\nThe present paper proposes an examination of instances from Lewis Nkosi's novel Mating Birds (1983), in order to show how the text exposes racism under apartheid through the balanced use of language and silences. Firstly, there is an exploration of issues concerning the relationship between society and apartheid from a historical perspective – this is crucial to understand how space becomes relevant in the configuration of the narrative. Secondly, the analysis focuses on two questions: a) how the English language created a hybrid protagonist whose lack of belonging is the ultimate consequence of apartheid; and, b) how meaningful silence is for the interpretation of the novel. In the interaction that takes place among the uses of language and silence, social space and apartheid policies the author revives features of the South African oral tradition in a narrative that combines future, present and past in \" an ever-unfolding now \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41). Resumen El presente trabajo examina instancias de la novela de Lewis Nkosi Mating Birds (1983), para mostrar cómo ésta expone el tema del racismo durante el período de apartheid a través del uso del lenguaje y los silencios. Primeramente, se exploran cuestiones relativas a la relación existente entre sociedad y apartheid desde una perspectiva histórica – esto es crucial para comprender cómo el espacio adquiere relevancia en la configuración de la narrativa. Luego, el análisis apunta a responder dos preguntas: a) cómo la lengua inglesa permitió la creación de un protagonista híbrido cuya falta de pertenencia es la consecuencia final del apartheid; y, b) qué significativo resulta el silencio para interpretar la novela. En la interacción que tiene lugar entre los usos del lenguaje y del silencio, el espacio social y las políticas del apartheid, el autor revive las características de la tradición oral sudafricana en una narrativa que combina futuro, presente y pasado en \" un ahora permanente \" (Edwards, 2008, p. 41).\n\nLewis Nkosi’s reputation is largely based on his acute and unflattering analysis of South African cultural production rather than on the short stories and plays that he published in the nineteen sixties. Indeed, hardly any critical commentary on the South African literary scene remains untouched by his 1965 seminal essay, ‘Fiction by Black South Africans’. In fact, such has been its impact on the South African literary debate that Lewis Nkosi has had to consistently defend and constantly elaborate on it in his subsequent essays.\n\nMandela&#39;s Ego (2006), Nkosi says, developed from a fantastical ideal, which is, of course, why it is a novel, in a certain sense of the word anyway. It can be seen against what Lewis Nkosi has said about writing by black South Africans in English, namely, that ... its [writing by black South Africans in English] formal insufficiencies, its disappointing breadline asceticism and prim disapproval of irony, and its well-known predilection for what Lukacs called &#39;petty realism, the trivially detailed painting of local colour&#39; ... can be seen to be a result, in part, of a claustrophobia related to ... internal colonialism from which, it is hoped, a post-apartheid condition will set it free (1998:77).Whereas this line of inquiry into black South African writing in English has become all too familiar, albeit its credentials remain contested, what is a more urgent question today is whether the hope of the freedom to experiment (with irony and fantastical tales, for instance) pos...\n\nAbstract This article examines the outbursts of Penny Sparrow and Vanessa Hartley on social media, both of whom directed theirs at the Black beachgoers of South Africa in late December 2015 and the early days of January 2016. The article recognises the events of #KingGeorgeMustFall at the University of KwaZulu- Natal and later #RhodesMustFall, which began in March 2015 as one of the backdrops of this discussion on physical space as politicised space and assert here the crucial components of flora and fauna such as the sea, sand, and the beach within a larger discussion on decolonisation. Discussions on decolonisation in South Africa have to include a critique of beaches as sites of enjoyment, which considering its colonial and apartheid history has since South Africa’s transition towards a democracy2 brought about an annual outpour of racist outbursts on social media, more particularly in the past decade, that foregrounded its racism by attacking Black bodies. In unpacking the content of Sparrow’s first posting, mainly, and her subsequent published apologies during interviews with journalists, the article moves towards a discussion of the Hegelian master and slave dialectic with a focus on desire, enjoyment and pleasure. It follows on with Lacanian jouissance, which is merged through the use of a South African language of desire drawn from the Kaaps vernacular (see footnote 1), with a Fanonian, Derridean and Bikoesque lens in addressing Black bodies on South African beaches as subjects who are agents and carriers of pleasure, surplus pleasure and orgasmic pleasure."
