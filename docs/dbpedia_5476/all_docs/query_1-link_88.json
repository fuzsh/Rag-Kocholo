        "text": "Critics and avid readers of South African literature will welcome this wide-ranging collection of works by and on Lewis Nkosi, the eminent playwright, novelist, poet, and literary critic. Erudite, well-researched essays plumb the depths of the diverse achievements of this complex writer, whom Casey Motsisi once deemed \"that angriest Angry Young Man.\" Those not already aware of Nkosi's contribution to literature, who may know him only as a writer cursorily discussed by Wole Soyinka in 1976 in terms of a \"salvationist ethic,\" will read in this volume about the nuanced perspectives of a postcolonial author who is both a \"migrant intellectual\" and a committed South African thinker. [End Page 129]\n\nFirst encountered in Africa during his brief work with the legendary journal Drum in the late fifties, Nkosi remains today a prolific writer of articles and reviews for publications such as Contact, New African, Transition, the Guardian, and The London Review of Books. He is most recognized, however, for his fiction, having burst on the literary scene with the play TheRhythm of Violence in 1964, and having drawn extensive critical attention with his 1983 novel, Mating Birds. Nkosi's oeuvre is indeed impressive, from his contributions to literature to his projects in radio, television, and film, and he has had a distinguished career as a professor of literature in the United States and England.\n\nPart 3 of Still Beating the Drum, \"A Retrospective Selection,\" includes some of Nkosi's own essays representing a cross-section of his views on literature and culture. His essay \"Négritude: New and Old Perspectives\" is a good place for readers of Nkosi's criticism to start, as the essay reflects the complexity of African history and of postcolonial perspectives on African literature. Nkosi's view of the Francophone literary and cultural movement (analogous in some ways to the Anglophone \"African Personality\" perspective of Kwame Nkrumah) reflects his position as migrant intellectual and engagé African writer. Granting the movement's history an essential place in the study of African literature at the outset, the essay traces négritude's intellectual influences, concluding with the genealogical metaphor of the \"Négritude family tree,\" which includes \"apart from the living African heritage, Freudianism, Marxism, surrealism, and Romanticism\" (290). He looks closely at the commentaries of Abiola Irele and Jean-Paul Sartre, whose seminal \"Orphée noir\" (1948) Nkosi believes to be still among the most subtle commentaries written on négritude.\n\nNkosi dismisses the idea that négritude thought has outlived its role, asserting its importance to black literature on a global scale, its significance as a set of cultural, philosophical, and literary concerns that remain debated today, and its relevance to intellectual history and to anyone committed to Africa and the diaspora. Léopold Senghor, Aimé Césaire, Alioune Diop, and Léon-Gontran Damas remain the most famous names. The intellectual branch of twentieth-century pan-Africanism since the twenties and thirties, when the movement coalesced in Parisian Francophone African and Caribbean intellectual circles, négritude was harshly criticized as a form of reverse racism by Nkosi's countryman Ezekiel Mphahlele in The African Image (1962). Denounced by writers such as Frantz Fanon, Rémy Medou Mvomo, and Wole Soyinka, the movement suffered a resounding blow at literary conferences in Dakar and Freetown in 1963 when it was dismissed by many other great writers, among them Tchicaya U Tam'si and Ousmane Sembène, who proclaimed it outmoded and superfluous.."
