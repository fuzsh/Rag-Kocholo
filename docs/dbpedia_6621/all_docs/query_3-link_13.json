        "text": "Jannike Wachowiak reflects on the results of the European Parliament elections and their implications for the EU. She highlights the hollowing out of the centrist coalition, creating challenges for the European People’s Party – it’s largest group – as to whether to work with parties to its right on certain issues.\n\nIn the lead up to the European Parliament elections there was a lot of talk about a possible far-right surge. But despite some high-profile wins in the elections – the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) came second in Germany and Marine Le Pen’s Rassemblement National (RN) topped the polls in France – the far-right underperformed in other places like the Nordics, Romania, and Portugal. Having won around a quarter of seats far-right parties may not dominate the EP, however, their stronger presence will test the internal cohesion of the centrist majority on certain policy issues like the implementation of the Green Deal.\n\nFar-right parties increased their vote share in the 2019 EP elections. This time round, many, but not all, did better still. With the French Rassemblement National, the Austrian Freedom Party, and the Dutch Party for Freedom making gains, the far-right Identity and Democracy group (ID), to which these parties belong, expanded from 49 to 58 members of parliament (MEPs). The modest increase is partly due to the collapse of Salvini’s Lega party in Italy and the sharp drop in support for Portugal’s far-right party, Chega. And crucially, the AfD’s expulsion from ID meant the loss of fifteen MEPs.\n\nThe other group to the right of von der Leyen are the European Conservative and Reformists (ECR). Led by Georgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, the group gained some four MEPs, though the Sweden Democrats and the Fins Party lost votes compared to 2019.\n\nThis may not be the final size and composition of the far-right. With an unusually high number of unaligned MEPs, of which over forty belong to the far-right spectrum, the next weeks will likely see new (and old) alliances being forged. The AfD, having ejected its scandal plagued lead candidate Maximilian Krah, could rejoin ID. And Meloni could invite the Hungarian Fidesz MEPs to strengthen her ranks. Should this happen some smaller ECR members, like the Sweden Democrats, could defect to the centre-right over Fidesz’s pro-Russian stance.\n\nNo matter the final shape of the far-right, what matters for the EP’s legislative function is the centrist majority. There was palpable relief at the HQ of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), which not only remains the biggest political group in the EP but returned an increased number of lawmakers.\n\nTogether with the centre-left, which largely held its share of the vote, and the liberal group, which suffered heavy losses, centrist parties won some 400 out of 720 seats. This gives them some leeway, but it is remarkable the extent to which the centre has been squeezed over the last ten years. EPP and S&D alone held some 470 MEPs in the 2009-14 legislative cycle. In the following term (2014-19), this shrunk to 412. And since the 2019 elections, the two groups have been reliant on the liberals for an overall majority.\n\nWith the hollowing out of the centre, the cohesion of these groups becomes more important. The first test will be the election of the Commission President. If European leaders nominate Ursula von der Leyen, she needs the votes of at least 361 MEPs to be re-elected. Despite a centrist majority of around 400, it is likely to be a close call. There are some dissenters in her own ranks, with the French Les Républicains not supporting her bid for a second term. Further attrition is likely. The ballot is secret, and in 2019, von der Leyen only scraped through by nine votes.\n\nBut without the support of the ‘grand coalition’, she faces a dilemma. If she looks to Meloni’s group for votes, she may lose the centre-left. Giacomo Filibeck, secretary general of the Party of European Socialists, has made clear ‘if it’s with ECR, it’s without us’. If she looks to the greens, she may frustrate those in her own political family who want her to focus on competitiveness over green issues. Yet, the uncertainty around who would be put forward if von der Leyen were rejected, and the lack of credible alternatives, is likely to lead to her election.\n\nIn the longer-term, the cohesion of the ‘grand coalition’ may be tested on other issues, particularly the implementation of the EU’s Green Deal. How the centre-right, as the strongest group, positions itself will be crucial.\n\nThe EPP’s manifesto criticises the Greens and the Socialists for treating the deal as a ‘new ideology’, and calls for ‘more technology – not bans’ to move away from fossil fuels. On the day of the election results, EPP leader Manfred Weber reiterated his demand to reverse EU-wide plans to phase out the combustion engine by 2035. The German Liberals have made this a condition for von der Leyen’s re-election.\n\nWhilst the watering down of the green agenda is unlikely to sit well with the (much diminished) Greens and parts of the Socialists, there may be some common ground with Meloni’s group. The ECR wants to ‘review the more problematic objectives of the Green Deal’, and sees the combustion engine as ‘commercially viable for years to come’.\n\nThe EPP as the largest group will have to walk a tightrope between holding together an increasingly narrow centrist coalition, and potentially working with parties to its right on a case-by-case basis. This could lead to gridlock on certain issues if the EPP were to vote with the ECR and ID groups to block some proposals (as it already attempted on the Nature Restoration Law in the previous legislative cycle).\n\nWith a higher degree of fragmentation, the tone in the plenary sessions is also set to become more unpleasant. Many far-right politicians will use it as a platform to score points domestically. So, whilst the impact of the elections may be constrained to certain policy issues rather than the overall direction of the EU, things will certainly not get any easier."
