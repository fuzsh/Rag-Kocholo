Yes. There is a closed list of reasons to exclude a bidder, for example, if it is known that a company has court judgements or open court cases against it which make it unsuitable or if it is financially insolvent, has not fulfilled its tax and social security obligations, or if a conflict of interest cannot be avoided by other, less drastic measures. (Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, §§ 78, 141(1) and 302 Federal Procurement Act in the field of Defence and Security of 2012 (BVergGVS), as amended in 2019, § 57) Are some bids automatically excluded? e.g., lowest/highest price; unusually low price, etc. Yes. Bids that have an implausible composition of the total price (eg speculative pricing), determined by an in-depth examination of the offer, can be automatically excluded. Bids which enclose prices not economically explainable and comprehensible, or those which are considered unreasonably low because the bidder received state aid can be exluded, but only after the price has been queried with the bidder. For the latter situation, if, at the request of the contracting authority, the bidder is unable to demonstrate within a reasonable period that the aid in question was compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Art. 107 TFEU, the bid can be excluded.

No. The number of evaluators is not specified. However, for the modality \"Competitions\" (\"Wettbewerbes\") it is specified that a jury, consisting of independent evaluators, will make a decision.

Yes. It is stated that the contracting authority must take suitable measures to effectively prevent, detect and remedy conflicts of interest that arise during the implementation of procurement procedures in order to avoid distortions of competition and ensure equal treatment of all entrepreneurs. The definition given of conflict of interest is that it exists in any case if employees of a contracting authority or an awarding body who are involved in the implementation of the award procedure or who can influence the outcome of the procedure have a direct or indirect financial, economic or other personal interest that could affect their impartiality and independence in the procurement process.

No. For general procurement, as well as utilities and defence procurement, evaluators must only be independent from bidders. In the modality \"Competitions\" (\"Wettbewerbes\") it is specified that a jury, consisting of evaluators independent of the participants in the competition, will make a decision. However, the contracting authority is involved in jury selection.

No. For general procurement in the upper threshold (i.e. EU thresholds), the award notice must mention criteria used, but not the scoring results. For utilities procurement in the upper threshold, the award notice should not even mention criteria used. In both types, the award notice should include the value/price of the successful bid OR the highest and lowest bids taken into account in the award.

All tenders (including defence and security) can be cancelled for objective reasons.

(Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, § 327 Federal Procurement Act in the field of Defence and Security of 2012 (BVergGVS), as amended in 2019, § 135) Is there a procurement regulatory body dedicated to public procurement? Yes. Bundesbeschaffung GmbH or Federal Procurement Agency http://www.bbg.gv.at (Bundesgesetz über die Errichtung einer Bundesbeschaffung Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung - BBGmbH-Gesetz) Does the law specify procurement advisors' profession (i.e. degree to be obtained, official list of members of the professional association) and its role in the tendering process (e.g. right to draft tender documentations, conduct market research identifying bidders)? No. Procurement advisors' profession is not specified. Within the scope of disputes, the adjudicating body, i.e. the Senate, consists of one member as chairman and two expert lay judges as assessors. Expert lay judges must have at least five years of relevant professional experience or special knowledge of the procurement process in legal, economic or technical terms. For the modality \"Competitions\" (\"Wettbewerbes\") it is specified that a jury, consisting of independent evaluators, will make a decision but no qualifications are mentioned. (Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, §§ 328, 329(1) and 165) Is disclosure of final, beneficial owners required for placing a bid? No. The Federal Procurement Act does not mention beneficial ownership and the Beneficial Owners Register Act (WiEReG) enacted in 2017 does not mention procurement procedures. ( )\n\nComplaints\n\nIs there a fee for arbitration procedure? Yes. If a bidder wants to: apply for review of a decision by the contracting authority they consider illegal up to the award of the contract; apply for an injunction or preliminary measure to prevent imminent damage to their interests; or argue that the Procurement Act has been violated during the awarding of the contract, a flat rate fee, linked to the consumer price index and paid once, applies. Fee rates are set according to the ratio of the procedural effort caused by the application to the benefit to be achieved for the applicant, and graded according to objective criteria such as the object of the contract, the type of procedure carried out, whether it is a request for a review of the tender or other separately contestable decisions or whether it is an award procedure in the upper or lower threshold area. No fees are due, however, if one of the provisions of the Fees Act 1957 (Gebührengesetz 1957, BGBl. Nr. 267/1957) applies and the law foresees the possibility of applying for legal aid. (Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, §§ 340 and 335 ) Is there a ban on contract signature until arbitration court decision (first instance court)? No. The request for a review has no suspensive effect for the relevant award procedure. (Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, § 342(3)) What is the maximum number of days until arbitration court decision from filing a complaint in the case of awarded contracts? General. 42 days (6 weeks) for a decision on an application for the annulment of decisions and 10 days for a decision on injunctions. (Federal Procurement Act of 2018 (BVergG), as amended in 2019, §§ 348 and 352(2)) Is there a requirement to publicly release arbitration court decisions ? No. The law does not require publication of decisions but in practice they are published on the website of the Bundesverwaltungsgericht: https://www.bverwg.de/ ( )"
