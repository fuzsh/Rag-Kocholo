        "text": "How the election works\n\nThis is the 10th election for the EU parliament, in which all 720 seats will be contested and 361 seats are needed for a majority. No single political group is likely to achieve this target.\n\nEach country is allocated a number of MEPs based on the principle of degressive proportionality, meaning MEPs from larger countries represent more people than MEPs from smaller countries. The minimum number of MEPs from any country is six, while the maximum number is 96.\n\nThe number of seats in the EU parliament has increased compared to the outgoing parliament, meaning that some of the seat change numbers need to be treated with care. France, Spain and the Netherlands each have two more seats. Poland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Ireland, Slovenia and Latvia each have one more seat.\n\nWithin each country, the number of MEPs elected from each political party is proportional to the number of votes it received.\n\nWhile seats are allocated by parties within each nation, most MEPs then join a series of transnational political groups – there are now seven, from the rightwing ID group to the Left group – based on shared ideals. Each group requires a minimum of 23 MEPs from at least a quarter of EU countries.\n\nA month after the elections, the far-right ID group was dissolved and the new Patriots for Europe group was formed, with France’s National Rally, Hungary’s Fidesz and Italy’s Lega being its largest parties.\n\nAbout these results\n\nSource: European parliament. Change figures are based on the outgoing parliament as of Friday 7 June 2024. Countries are grouped in regions according to the United Nations geoscheme.\n\nResults will be tagged with one of three notes, to indicate how final the seat projections are for each country:\n\nEstimate, when when voting is finished and there is an estimate of a country’s results based on polling institutes;\n\nProjection, for when there is an estimate of the full EU parliament composition;\n\nProvisional, for when a country’s official election authority has published its first voting results but the final result is not known, and when the full EU parliament’s composition depends on such provisional national figures;\n\nFinal, for when a country’s official election authority has published full results;\n\nConstitutive, for when the full EU parliament’s composition is officially confirmed.\n\nAlthough the seat allocations per party per country will be final once the count is concluded in each member state, the seats per parliamentary grouping at country and EU levels will be provisional until all parties have decided which, if any, parliamentary grouping they will join, which may take days or weeks."
