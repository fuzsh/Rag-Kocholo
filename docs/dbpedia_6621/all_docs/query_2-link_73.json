        "text": "Voters delivered gains for right-wing parties, some with nationalist and anti-immigrant policy agendas, projections for the European Parliament elections show. But the political center held, with mainstream conservatives, socialists and liberals controlling a comfortable majority in the 720-seat assembly.\n\nStill, far-right parties surged in France and in Germany. In France, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called for snap elections after his Renaissance party got battered by the National Rally party of Marine Le Pen, which is part of the Identity and Democracy group. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats finished behind Alternative for Germany, an ultranationalist party that is not currently affiliated with a larger group.\n\nIn the European Parliament, the European People’s Party, a center-right group, performed better than in the last elections and will continue to be the largest party in Parliament. Renew, a liberal group, and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats both marked losses compared to the last elections.\n\nRead more about the major political party groups\n\nThe vote was important in setting the political tone in the E.U. for the next five years, and could determine how major issues such as migration are handled. The European Parliament approves E.U. laws, international treaties and plays an important role in scrutinizing spending.\n\nMainstream conservative and the social democratic parties appear as though they will together still hold a majority of seats, just like five years ago in the last election.\n\nElection results are announced country by country, and voting is organized according to national rules."
