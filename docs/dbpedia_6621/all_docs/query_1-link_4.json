        "text": "Most political parties in the European parliament make alliances with each other, forming larger groups with those who share their broad ideology. This year’s elections are expected to shake up the parliament’s political landscape as a surge in support for hard-right parties is predicted to strengthen nationalist and far-right groups.\n\nAt the same time, parties new to the European parliament will be looking for groups to join, and some of those getting re-elected are looking for fresh alliances as well.\n\nOne such party is Hungary’s ruling far-right Fidesz party, which quit the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) in 2021 when it faced possible suspension or expulsion. Now, it has its eyes on the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.\n\nOn the liberal side, Renew Europe is expected to decide after the election whether to expel the Dutch VVD party over its decision to enter government with the far right.\n\nHere’s a quick guide to the groups in the European parliament.\n\nThe European People’s party (EPP)\n\nThis is the biggest political family, representing the centre right. It includes heavyweights such as Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Poland’s Civic Platform. It has the most seats in parliament and is set to retain its position as the biggest group in the next one.\n\nThe Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D)\n\nThis group, commonly referred to as the Socialists and Democrats, is the second largest. It includes parties such as Spain’s Socialist party and Germany’s Social Democratic party.\n\nRenew Europe\n\nThis grouping brings together centrist and liberal parties, including Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance. It is expected to lose seats in the elections.\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists (ECR)\n\nThis is the grouping that pundits, journalists and politicians have been chatting about the most over the past weeks. There is a debate about whether the centre right will open up to more cooperation with at least some of the ECR’s members. It includes parties such as Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy and Poland’s conservative Law and Justice – but also groupings such as Spain’s far-right Vox and the French far-right party Reconquest, founded by Éric Zemmour.\n\nIdentity and Democracy (ID)\n\nThe ID group consists of a range of far-right parties, including France’s National Rally, Austria’s Freedom party and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang. In May, Alternative for Germany (AfD) was expelled from the group after a spate of scandals.\n\nGreens\n\nThe Greens group, with members such as the German Greens, is expected to lose seats in these elections.\n\nThe Left\n\nThis group includes members such as La France Insoumise and Ireland’s Sinn Féin."
