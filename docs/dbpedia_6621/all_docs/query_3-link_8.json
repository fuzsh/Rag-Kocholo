        "text": "The far right has made gains in Austria and Germany, the first national election estimates released by the European Parliament show.\n\nIn Austria, the far-right Freedom Party (part of the Identity and Democracy group, ID) would have six seats, according to the estimates. If those numbers are confirmed, the Freedom Party will have doubled its number of seats and leapfrogged the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) — which are both predicted to get 5 MEPs.\n\nIn Germany, the conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union finished first in Sunday’s election in the country, according to early estimates. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is projected to finished second, ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD).\n\nData was made available by the Parliament for Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Cyprus, YouTuber Fidias Panayiotou, standing as an independent, appears to have earned a seat, with estimates putting him in third place behind the center-right DISY and far-left AKEL, and ahead of the social-democrats in DIKO.\n\nThe far-right ELAM received 10.4 percent of votes, according to the first estimates, making it the fifth-largest political force.\n\nThe Parliament’s early estimates have the ID group getting seven seats in the Netherlands, which is in line with exit polls following the Dutch election on Thursday. All seven of those seats would belong to Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party.\n\nWilders’ party was beaten into second place by a Labor-Green alliance, but in the EU Parliament the MEPs for that alliance would be split between political groups.\n\nIn Greece, initial exit polls show the ruling conservative New Democracy party leading by a significant margin, but significantly weakened compared to previous support.\n\nNew Democracy is projected to receive between 28 percent and 32 percent. This is down from the 40.5 percent it got last June in national elections, and also misses the target it set for itself, which was the support it got in the last European election (33.1 percent)."
