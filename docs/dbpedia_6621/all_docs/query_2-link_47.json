        "text": "Swiss People’s Party, conservative Swiss political party. The Swiss People’s Party (SVP) was founded in 1971 by the merger of the Farmers, Artisans, and Citizens’ Party—generally known as the Agrarian Party—with the Democratic Party. It has pursued conservative social and economic policies, including lower taxes and reduced spending, as well as the protection of Swiss agriculture and industry. The party has also opposed Swiss membership in international bodies such as the United Nations (which Switzerland joined in 2002) and the European Union. Although its support was originally concentrated in rural Switzerland, it now enjoys considerable success in urban areas. It has also been strong historically with German-speaking Swiss citizens.\n\nFrom 1959 to 2003 the Agrarian Party and its successor, the SVP, retained one seat on the Federal Council, Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch. In 1959 the Agrarian Party, along with the Christian Democratic People’s Party, the Radical Democratic Party (the antecedent of FDP. The Liberals), and the Social Democratic Party, established a so-called magic formula for representation on the Federal Council that gave the Agrarian Party, and the SVP as its successor, one seat on the Council while each of the other three parties retained two. Adopting a more populist agenda in the 1990s, particularly on immigration and social welfare, the party made substantial gains, and in the 1999 elections it won the largest vote share and the second greatest number of seats in the lower house of the parliament."
