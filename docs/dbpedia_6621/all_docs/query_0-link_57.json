        "text": "The Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) consists of 306 members of the national Parliaments and 306 substitutes. They are divided into 5 political fractions:\n\nSocialists, Democrats and Greens Group (SOC)\n\nGroup of the European People's Party (EPP/CD)\n\nAlliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE)\n\nEuropean Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance (EC/DA)\n\nGroup of the Unified European Left (UEL)\n\nMembers not belonging to a Political Group\n\nThe Austrian Delegation consists of 6 members and 6 substitutes who are all members of the Austrian Nationalrat or Austrian Bundesrat.\n\nThe PACE holds four regular plenary sessions per year and periodically meets in commissions. It develops resolutions, recommendations, opinions and guidelines for Governments, Parliaments or political parties. The assembly also monitors elections and crisis-regions in Europe. Since January 2022 Tiny Kox (Netherlands) is President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\n\nThe work of the Parliamentary Assembly has been conducted primarily by videoconference since March 2020. In June 2022, it will again be possible to perceive all aspects of parliamentary life in Strasbourg. The Austrian parliamentary delegation to the June session was correspondingly high-ranking.\n\nLikewise, contacts between MEPs and the Permanent Representation can now once again be maintained directly.\n\nCities and municipalities that strive to achieve European standards in their administration can apply for the Diploma of Europe, the Plaque of Honor and the Europe Prize. Several Austrian provincial capitals have received the award in the last 74 years, most recently St. Pölten in 2001: List of award winners.\n\nApplications with online form possible until January 15, 2023."
