        "text": "Europe\n\nEU election results\n\nVoters in the 27 countries of the European Union delivered a clear shift to the right in the European Parliament election, with gains for the centre-right and nationalists and a crushing defeat for French President Emmanuel Macron's party..\n\nThe parliament has for the past five years been governed by a three-group majority of the centre-right European People's Party, centre-left Socialists and Democrats and liberals or Renew Europe.\n\nTogether they have steered EU policy, which has included the Green Deal and the EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and divided between them top jobs at EU institutions.\n\nThe groups appear on course for a renewed majority, albeit smaller than before, with each party group set to have one of the top jobs.\n\nThe following are projected results of the new EU parliament:\n\nParliament group\n\nProjected seats\n\nEuropean Peopleâs Party EPP\n\n189\n\nProgressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats S&D\n\n136\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists ECR\n\n83\n\nRenew Europe Renew\n\n74\n\nIdentity and Democracy ID\n\n58\n\nGreens / European Free Alliance Greens\n\n51\n\nNot yet declared members* Undeclared\n\n45\n\nNon-attached members NA\n\n45\n\nThe Left Left\n\n39\n\nThe latest seat projection by the European Parliament showed the centre-right European Peopleâs Party reinforcing is status as the biggest group of lawmakers and hard-right groups also adding seats. By contrast, the Greens, lost notably in Germany, and the liberal Renew Europe also shrunk as Marine Le Penâs Rassemblement National trounced Macronâs Renaissance party, prompting him to call a snap parliamentary election. It was also a bad result for German Chancellor Olaf Scholzâs social democrats.\n\nParliament groups\n\nMost members of the European Parliament (MEPs) sit in groups based on their political affiliations. They need to have at least 23 MEPs from seven EU countries. Groups receive a share of EU funding of more than 40 million euros based on their size and their representatives get to speak first in parliamentary debates. The outgoing parliament had seven groups. There is likely to be some shake-up before the parliament sits again on July 16, particularly among hard-right groups.\n\nResults by country\n\nSort by\n\nAustria\n\nTotal seats
