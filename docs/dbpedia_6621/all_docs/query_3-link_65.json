        "text": "Nationalism has always been a feature across Europe's political spectrum but there has been a recent boom in voter support for right-wing and populist parties.\n\nIt is visible from Germany, where the AfD has become the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag, to Spain, where Vox has become the third largest force in parliament.\n\nIn part, voters are frustrated with the political establishment, but they also have concerns about globalisation, immigration, a dilution of national identity and the European Union.\n\nIn the European Parliament, nine far-right parties have formed a new bloc, called Identity and Democracy (ID).\n\nSo where in Europe's political landscape do right-wing nationalists hold sway?\n\nIn 2017 the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the federal parliament for the first time with 12.6% of the vote, becoming Germany's biggest opposition party.\n\nFrom its beginnings as an anti-euro party, it has pushed for strict anti-immigration policies, embraced hostility towards Islam and broken decades-old anti-Nazi taboos. It enjoyed a surge in popularity as Germany allowed in over a million undocumented migrants.\n\nDespite attempts by Chancellor Angela Merkel to toughen her stance on immigration, the party has added to its electoral success and now has representatives in every state parliament.\n\nIn October 2019 the AfD came ahead of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) in the eastern state of Thuringia - a shock to the political establishment.\n\nThe AfD is also Eurosceptic and Nigel Farage, leader of the UK's Brexit Party, took part in its 2017 election campaign.\n\nThe Brexit Party was the clear winner in the UK's European elections in May, despite its lack of seats in the UK Parliament. The party insists that the UK must leave the EU unconditionally: it argues that this was mandated by the Leave vote in the UK's 2016 referendum.\n\nVox styles itself as defending the unity of the Spanish state, with a promise to deport illegal immigrants and repeal laws against gender violence.\n\nIt has made major gains by calling for a suspension of autonomy for the north-eastern Catalonia region, after separatists failed in their push for independence in October 2017.\n\nMany believed that Spaniards would never endorse a far-right party due to its history under dictator Francisco Franco, who died in 1975. Just a single seat had been won by a far-right candidate since then - in 1979.\n\nThe Freedom Party (FPÃ) became the only far-right party in power in Western Europe when it joined a coalition as junior partner with conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in 2017. His People's Party, along with the centre-left Social Democrats, have long dominated Austrian politics.\n\nAs in Germany, the migrant crisis that unfolded in 2015 was also seen as key to the FPÃ's success, and an issue they long campaigned on.\n\nDuring its time in power the Freedom Party became caught up in a series of race rows. Then, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache and parliament group head Johann Gudenus were caught up in a scandal over a video \"sting\" filmed in Ibiza in 2017.\n\nMr Strache resigned and the fallout led to the far-right party quitting the government and support for the FPÃ fell sharply to 16% in September elections.\n\nDespite the efforts of leader Marine Le Pen to make the far right palatable to France's mainstream, she was comprehensively defeated by Emmanuel Macron for the presidency in May 2017.\n\nHer National Front (FN) failed to break through in parliamentary elections the following month, and the party was then renamed the National Rally (Rassemblement National).\n\nMs Le Pen's party is opposed to the euro and blames the EU for mass immigration, and she has found a common voice with other nationalist and far-right parties in Europe.\n\nThe anti-immigration Sweden Democrats (SD) made significant gains in the 2018 general election, winning about 18% of the vote.\n\nThe party has its roots in neo-Nazism, but it rebranded itself in recent years and first entered parliament in 2010. It opposes multiculturalism and wants strict immigration controls.\n\nAs with many of the countries featured here, though, the picture is complex. Sweden has welcomed more asylum seekers per capita than any other European country and has one of the most positive attitudes towards migrants, external.\n\nThe far-right Finns Party were narrowly beaten into second place in the April 2019 general election, coming within 0.2% of the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\nIts success was built on two policies: opposition to immigration and a rejection of ambitious policies aimed at combating climate change.\n\nIt was an extraordinary recovery for a party that had also done well in the previous vote in 2015 but had since faded in popularity because of party splits.\n\nEstonia's far-right Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) won its first seats in parliament in the 2015 election.\n\nFour years later, EKRE has more than doubled its share of the vote to nearly 18%, making it the third-largest party. It used that power to negotiate a place in government, as it joined fellow runners-up the Centre and Pro Patria parties to stop liberal leader Kaja Kallas from becoming Estonia's first woman prime minister.\n\nEKRE campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, and is also critical of same-sex marriage. Its leader, Martin Helme, once said that only white people should be allowed to move to Estonia.\n\nMr Orban has long presented himself as the defender of Hungary and Europe against Muslim migrants, once warning of the threat of \"a Europe with a mixed population and no sense of identity\".\n\nIn March 2019 Europe's mainstream centre-right grouping, the EPP, suspended Fidesz because of its anti-EU stance.\n\nHungary has two nationalist parties - with Jobbik attempting to escape its far-right past and appeal to centrist voters - and gaining 19% of the vote in 2018.\n\nAlthough it fell a long way short of a majority, the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) was the largest party in this year's general election.\n\nThe party is led by former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, a supporter of Hungary's Viktor Orban. He has said he wants Slovenia to \"become a country that will put the wellbeing and security of Slovenians first\".\n\nAn anti-immigration, nationalist party called Greek Solution got 3.7% in Greece's 2019 national election, giving it 10 seats in the 300-seat parliament.\n\nThe neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party no longer has any seats in the parliament.\n\nVoter frustration with Greece's continuing economic malaise and the migrant crisis has not translated into a big surge for the far right."
