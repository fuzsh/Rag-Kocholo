        "text": "Could real life be intruding on the soft-focus, perfume-scented world of romantic fiction? Harlequin Mills & Boon Ltd, the world's largest romance publisher, is trading fairy-tale endings for friends, tears and red wine - at least sometimes.\n\nInspired by the success of \"chick lit\" - stories of fallible, single professional women in the mould of Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary - the company is launching a new line of books designed to depict women's real lives.\n\nRed Dress Ink, an imprint \"dedicated to the trials and tribulations of twentysomething females\", was launched in North America last northern autumn, with the first title appearing in Britain in April.\n\n\"The original inspiration came from seeing the success of things like Bridget Jones's Diary, Sex and the City, and Friends,\" said the company's senior product manager, Gemma Clutterbuck.\n\n\"Young women today want to see their own lives, in all the messy detail, reflected in fiction today,\" she added.\n\nPublished in 1996, Bridget Jones's Diary has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, been turned into a film and spawned a slew of bright, breezy paperbacks with titles like Single White E-Mail, and Tom, Dick and Debbie Harry.\n\nHarlequin Mills & Boon - formed when Canadian romance giant Harlequin bought its older British cousin Mills & Boon in 1971 - says it sells 175 million books a year in 26 languages.\n\nIts romance titles are grouped into series including Modern Romance (\"glamorous and sophisticated\"), Tender Romance (\"warm and emotionally fulfilling\") and Sensual (\"sexy, sassy and seductive\"), as well as medical-themed and historical romances.\n\nAll are designed to appeal to fortysomething women who want to be swept away by tales of romance with handsome, rich, mysterious men.\n\nRed Dress Ink titles, aimed at readers aged 18 to 34, feature swearing, drinking and even commitment-free sex. Harlequin says the new books will be \"gossipy, compulsive, edgy and ironic; and they're not always about ending up with Mr Right\".\n\n\"It's a completely different feel - very witty and bold,\" Clutterbuck said in an interview.\n\nSome, however, question whether \"chick lit\" is much different from traditional romance fiction. Bridget Jones may be a Chardonnay-guzzling urbanite, but she still hopes to find true love with hunky Mark Darcy.\n\nThe first Red Dress Ink title published in Britain, Milkrun, by Canadian writer Sarah Mlynowski, is billed as the story of twentysomething heroine Jackie's quest \"to find Mr Right\".\n\nAnd some female authors have been less than impressed with the genre.\n\nLast year, Booker Prize-nominated novelist Beryl Bainbridge dismissed chick lit as \"froth\".\n\nRespected colleague Doris Lessing agreed.\n\n\"It would be better, perhaps, if they wrote books about their lives as they really saw them and not these helpless girls, drunken, worrying about their weight and so on,\" Lessing said.\n\nClutterbuck says the Red Dress Ink titles are different.\n\n\"There is real depth to them,\" she said. \"They're not light and fluffy.\""
