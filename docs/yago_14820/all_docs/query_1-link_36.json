They are curious about their world – and how it works. New to everything, they wonder daily about everything - about the lives of famous people – about how they became famous and what were they like before – to why is the sky blue – and how can I make a million dollars? And more importantly, how can they achieve – or at least, survive – to live a rewarding and self-fulfilling life.\n\nFor true, not every teen wants to be famous. But most teens want to understand their world – and of course, themselves. They want to understand how their body works, how their parents think, and how the world evolves – often at the hands of people who change the way in which we live – seemingly effortlessly, miraculously, and often, hidden from plain view.\n\nI mean – do you remember when cordless phones were not a reality? When flying into space was considered science fiction? Or when heating things up meant turning on the oven – and praying you did not burn yourself?\n\nYes, long before cell phones, space shuttles, and microwaves – human beings spent years coming up with inventions that changed our lives dramatically. And often, we forget how difficult and tenuous this journey towards human progress was – and remains. Yet, through it all, there is always the ever-present curiosity of wonder. Of how things work and who invented what – and why?\n\nHere are four keen nonfiction books – especially tailored to adolescent readers – that should grace every classroom bookshelf – as they are genuine discussion starters for any classroom lesson on learning about the stuff in life that we are often curious about – but sometimes know little about – and why it is important to know...\n\nI know that this sounds like simple stuff – but as teachers know, sometimes explaining the most ‘simple things’ can lead adolescents on ‘unexpected journeys’ to learn the truth – and maybe, inspire a budding scientist, inventor, or perhaps, future Nobel Prize winner. And what better way to whet their appetite – than with a fun graphic novel.\n\nCash is Queen: A Girl’s Guide to Securing, Spending and Stashing Cash\n\n​by Davinia Tomlinson ​and illustrated by Andrea Oerter (Frances Lincoln Children’s Books, 2023)\n\nFor every teen – no matter your sex or sexual identity – Cash is Queen explains in simple languages and pictures – what everyone needs to know and understand – about how to earn, save and manage money. What I like about this important and necessary read – is that the author discusses topic that is rarely shared aloud – money and the making of money – and it is delivered with a crisp and undeniable appeal to today’s young people.\n\nQuestions I Am Asked About the Holocaust: Young Readers Edition\n\nby Hedi Fried. Translated by Alice E. Olsson, illustrated by Laila Ekboir (Scribble, 2023)\n\n​Where to Start: A Survival Guide to Anxiety, Depression and Other Mental Health Challenges\n\nby Mental Health America. Illustrated by Gemma Correll (Rocky Pond Books, 2023)\n\nColorfully and cartoonishly illustrated, this is a most comforting and highly useful resource of anyone – especially adolescents – who are struggling emotionally, psychologically, and mentally, - with issues that seem insurmountable and incurable. Addressing the needs of all who are living in emotional despair – this easy-to-read self-help resource is the perfect discussion starter for all teens who are on the cusp of self-discovery and self-awareness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are four contemporary non-fiction reads for young people. Told simply, carefully, and engagingly, these good books will do much to satisfy the needs of all – who hunger for information and desire to know more about the world in which they live and the human condition in which they inhabit. Too often, non-fiction is considered the parlance of social studies classrooms – or special electives, like health education - or programs honoring historical events, such as D-Day or Dr. Martin Luther King’s holiday.\n\nWhy not make the study of non-fiction an everyday occurrence – and introduce to young people the choices, discoveries, and understandings – of everyday events – as a part of their everyday lives – in and outside the classroom door? After all, the more they read, the more they will know.\n\nWeekend Pick for July 21, 2023\n\nLooking for something to read?\n\n​Check out our weekly suggestions!\n\nAre your students looking for book recommendations?\n\nSend them to browse through the picks for this or past years.\n\nFor the picks from 2022 click here\n\nFor the picks from 2021 click here\n\nFor the picks from 2020 click here.\n\nFor older picks click from 2019 click here.\n\nFor the even older picks click here.\n\nThis week, we welcome our kind and devoted friend Dr. Jeffrey Kaplan to contribute to Weekend Picks.

Thank you, Dr. Kaplan!\n\nBooks about Divorce for Middle School Readers\n\nDo you remember when divorce was taboo?\n\nI do.\n\nIn the 70s, when Ronald Reagan ran for President (1981 – 1989), the central question was not his politics – it was his divorce.\n\nPresident Reagan had been married once before – to movie star Jane Wyman in the 1940s (1940 – 1949) and the burning issue on the American public’s mind was – can a divorced American become President of the United States?\n\nThe issue seems quaint now – considering what we know about the personal lives of past and current presidents – but at the time, the notion of a divorced politician was jarring – to say the least. Men and women – especially, those in elected office – were to be the epitome of American goodness – and anything in one’s background to blemish that image – was considered suspect – if not downright, immoral.\n\nAnd as a kid, I never knew anyone in my neighborhood whose parents were divorced – and the discussion was never broached by friends and neighbors who would gossip frequently about what was going on in the house next door.\n\nTimes have changed, though.\n\nAnd thank goodness for that.\n\nWe are more open and honest about our feelings – with ourselves and with each other – and how, society readily accepts the notion of divorce – and divorced parents – and other parental arrangements – such as single parenting, domestic partnerships, and interracial marriages.\n\nStill, divorce is never easy. For couples, divorce is a painful reminder that life is not perfect – and sometimes, separation is the only answer. And for children and adolescents, seeing parents separate – and living in separate households – can be quite traumatic.\n\nThis weekend picks involve 5 middle grade books about the lives of adolescents whose parents go their separate ways. All are seen through the eyes of teens who are torn between love and grief – love for their parents, and grief that they must live, - like their newly emancipated parents, -separate lives. And all are asking readers to confront an uncomfortable world – a world not filled with the strife of poverty, disease, and war, - but a more personal struggle – of personal anger, resentment, grievance – and eventual recognition – that love – like human beings – comes in many shapes and sizes. And having divorced parents is one.\n\nStepping Stonesby Lucy Knisley (Random House, 2020)\n\nMiddle schooler Jen’s parents are divorced and now Jen’s mom is living with her boyfriend, Walter, on a farm in upstate New York. Trouble is – besides that her parents are separated and living miles apart – is that Jen is a city girl – and could not feel more uncomfortable and out-of-place than living among mud and animals.\n\nOlder children and middle schoolers – who particularly like fantasy – talking animals, especially, - will find this fanciful tale engaging and thought-provoking – amid adventurous twists and turns – this story offers a dose of real-world coping skills for younger (and older) audiences.\n\nBlended by Sharon Draper (Atheneum/Caitlyn Dloughy Books, 2018)\n\nIn a more realistic vein, Isabella, 11-year-old daughter of a white mother and a Black father, is feeling pigeon-holed and stereotyped by her neighbor’s assumptions about her. Is she white? Is she Black? Is she both? Does it really matter?\n\n​ Things get worse, though, when her parents suddenly – almost, unexpectedly - divorce and like most kids, Isabella finds herself shuffled between two homes. Not knowing whether she is coming or going, she grows more and more frustrated as she feels like a ping pong ball between two warring parents.\n\nConclusion\n\nNo book can make life better – but for young people, who often think that they are the only person in the world who is going through ‘what they are going’ – a good book can often be just the tonic to soothe an aching heart – or at the very least, make them realize that they are not alone.\n\nTo be sure, there are many problems in the world – and teachers and students are often the first to confront these issues daily in their classes – making it imperative that teachers (and parents) have access to resources that young people can easily read and digest. For such reading, lives are changed.\n\nAs is often said, “The hand that rocks the cradle, rules the world.” A good book can do the same.\n\nThank you, Dr. Kaplan, for such a rich collection of middle-grade novels!\n\n​Enjoy reading, friends!\n\n​\n\nUntil next week,\n\n​Leilya"
