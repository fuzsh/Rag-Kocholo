For 70 years the current Girl Scouts Camp Four Echoes lodge, located on Lake Coeur d’ Alene, has been serving girls, ages 5 to 17. The lodge was originally built by the Spokane Lions Club in 1940 and has had multiple additions in order to continue serving the increasing volume of girls enrolled in Girl Scout camp activities. In addition, the gift supports Girl Scout programs in science, technology, engineering and math to provide young women a lens to see what careers might be available to them in the future. Awesome! Have you ever been to Lake Coeur d’ Alene? It looks beautiful.\n\nLast week, Daily Hampshire Gazette ran an excellent run-down of five Hampshire County Girl Scouts who recently earned the Girl Scout Gold Award. From fostering animal shelter kittens, establishing health center recycling programs to building a therapeutic riding trail - these projects put sustainable systems in place to improve their communities.\n\nDefinitely read the entire article! Are there Girl Scout Gold Award stories you would like to share?\n\nHello!\n\nSummer is winding down and so am I. In order to stay sane, I am going to be away from the office for a couple of weeks. There will still be postings on the Blog - but not at the current frequency. I hope everyone has had a wonderful time this Summer!\n\nCheers, Joshua\n\nIn Oklahoma, The Moore American reports that when the next governor of Oklahoma takes the oath of office in January, she will be bringing with her the words from another oath - The Girl Scout Promise and Law. Both candidates for Oklahoma’s governor this year are Girl Scouts, and both said the leadership skills they learned to get them to this important moment in the state’s history can be traced directly to the experiences they had as a Girl Scout. Cathy Stackpole, CEO for Girl Scouts of Western Oklahoma states:\n\n“The fact that we have two distinguished women running for the top leadership position in our state who also were Girl Scouts is a testament to the power of the leadership experience of Girl Scouts.”\n\nLt. Gov. Jari Askins, Democrat, and Congresswoman Mary Fallin, Republican, are proud of their own Girl Scout experiences and both remain active in the organization today. Fallin is a member of Troop Capitol Hill, an honorary Girl Scout Troop comprised of women serving in Congress. Askins is a member of the local Juliette Low Leadership Society, which supports Girl Scouts of Western Oklahoma and is an adult member of the local council.\n\nLeadership in action - definitely a fantastic example. Check out the entire article here. How many women in governance do you think were Girl Scouts?\n\nTake a look at the new 30 second PSA titled Park Girls - illustrating a life without Girl Scouting vs. a life with Girl Scouting. For more Girl Scout Videos, go here!\n\nToday, the President of the Girl Scout Council of the Nation’s Capital, Diane Tipton, announced the appointment of Lidia Soto-Harmon as the organization’s CEO. Soto-Harmon will lead the organization, which serves 90,000 members, in the Greater Washington Region - covering the District of Columbia and 25 counties in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nOf greatest importance to Soto-Harmon is the development of a strong membership, inclusive of all girls and reflective of the racial and socio-economic diversity in her region. She states:\n\n“Girl Scouting makes a tremendous difference in the lives of girls and adults...\n\nBy being a part of Girl Scouts, countless generations of young women develop the\n\nleadership skills and the spirit of service that will help them bring positive\n\nchange to our world. I am honored to take on this new role and to continue\n\nserving this organization that I love.”\n\nIt's not all talk either - Soto-Harmon has done some pretty amazing things. For the past six years, she served as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) for the Council. She has been charged with growing membership, engaging and developing adult volunteers, creating innovative girl programs, reaching out to girls in underserved communities and ensuring the inclusion of girls with physical and cognitive disabilities. During her tenure as COO she developed an annual conference that reached young Latinas with a message of leadership called Encuentro de Chicas Latinasde las Girl Scouts. She also developed a leadership conference for high school girls who are residents of the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County through a partnership with Howard University called Your Turn to Lead.\n\nPrior to joining Girl Scouts, Soto-Harmon spent 25 years in leadership positions in the corporate, nonprofit and government sectors. As Senior Vice President of First Book, she helped increase access to new books for children from low-income households across the country. At the US Department of State, she served as Deputy Director of the President’s Inter agency Council on Women, traveling across the world to develop policies aimed at benefiting women and children. The accomplishment list on Soto-Harmon goes on and on. Needless to say, we are thrilled to have her on board - Congrats to her and to The Girl Scout Council of Nation's Capital!\n\nIn Nebraska, The Columbus Telegram has a fascinating look into the Girl Scout Gold Award Project of Baily Bond. Bond, 15, is working with Horticulturist Harlan Hamernik to cultivate artemisia annua, a plant that cures malaria. Bond has taken on the task of coordinating nearly 30 volunteers who range in age from 12-18 in the effort to help Hamernik germinate, propagate, cultivate and harvest the nearly 45,000 artemisia annua plants. Moreso, she is working in the hopes that UNICEF will come on board to assist with the shipping and distribution of the first harvest of the malaria plant. Bond will continue the project this summer and she hopes into next summer when she will receive credit for the project to be applied toward her Gold Award. Very impressive indeed.\n\nDefinitely check out the entire article. Are there any Girl Scout Gold Award Projects you would like to share?\n\nOn Wednesday, September 1, at 2:00 p.m. EST, join us for a webcast of the 2011 R.E.A.L. Girl Fashion Show Launch Party!

Watson was presented with the National Girl Scout Bronze Cross Life Saving Award.\n\nBack in January, a fire stated in her grandma’s bedroom and Amelia helped rescue her from the house and called 911. Once outside, she wrapped her grandma in a blanket to prevent shock. Amelia says she’s honored to receive the Girl Scout award. Kudos to everyone involved!\n\nToday, The Miami Herald has a traveler's guide to Savannah, GA - the birthplace of Juliette Gordon Low. The article pinpoints many sights to see in Savannah, including both The Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace and The Girl Scout Museum. The Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace was saved from destruction by the Girl Scouts, who raised $60,000 in three years through their Dimes for Daisy initiative. The house, owned by the Girl Scouts of the USA, was the first National Historic Landmark in the city and is staffed by grown-up Girl Scouts. Built in 1821, the house has been elegantly restored to reflect the 1880s and furnished with many original Gordon family pieces, including artwork by Juliette Gordon Low.\n\nI spent a large amount of my childhood in Savannah and have always thought it to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Have you ever been to The Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace?\n\nAs many people ramp up for the beginning of the school year - Girl Scouts are out and about:\n\nGeorgia's Athens Banner-Herald has a fantastic story about a group of Girl Scouts that just returned from England, where they toured London and celebrated the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts' 100-year anniversary at a week long camp in Yorkshire.\n\nIn Virginia, The Suffolk News-Herald has an article about Girl Scouts collecting items for foster children.\n\nIn Kansas, The Salina Journal reports that Girl Scouts are teaming up with the Rolling Hills Zoo.\n\nThe Chicago Reader has a rewiew of Troop 1500: and Girl Scouts Beyond Bars.\n\nNorthern California's Times-Standard has an article about a Girl Scout Cadette's Silver Award project promoting fitness awareness.\n\nIn Oklahoma, both The Tulsa-World and The Alva Review-Courier have stories on the changes going on in Girl Scouting.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEarlier this month, Kentucky's WHAS News 11 reported on nine members of Girl Scout Troop 97 who have been together as Girl Scouts since they were young girls. They’ve now grown into young women, but they haven’t outgrown being a Girl Scout. Check it out!\n\nThe Long Island Herald has a fantastic and extensive article about Valley Stream Girl Scout Troop 2053, who recently spent a week working for Habitat for Humanity in Salem, N.J. After years together as a troop, the girls decided that they wanted to do something meaningful as a group before they went their separate ways, and with everyone entering either college, or senior year of high school, this would be their last chance. They decided that after years of cookie sales, they wanted to do something with their money that would introduce them to a new experience while helping those in need at the same time.\n\nThe article relates that Habitat for Humanity was the obvious choice as it offered a great life experience as well as important lessons in home improvement, and gave the girls an opportunity to see their work materialized in the form of a house for a single mother of two young children. Definitely read the entire article!\n\nAlso, when I was reading this article and looking through the pictures, I was reminded of our new Brand Campaign - specifically the ad about building homes. Cool stuff indeed.\n\nWhat did You do Today?\n\nPlease excuse the Robert Frost\n\nreference - I had to. Regardless, it does relate to a story in Minnesota's Woodbury Bulletin about a couple of Girl Scouts who recently earned their Girl Scout Gold Awards by building a natural play area at a local nature center. More than a year ago, Laura Chandler and Sarah Mittelstadt began discussing what type of project they wanted to do for their Gold Award when their troop was approached by the Friends of Maplewood Nature with the idea of building something on the nature center property. Barbara Kroll, director of Friends of Maplewood Nature, said the center wanted something constructed on the nature center property because they wanted to attract more people to the area. Chandler and Mittelstadt said they’re excited with how the project has turned out and hope some kids will come out to play. Read the entire article to learn more about their process. Kudos to all involved!\n\nDo you have any Girl Scout Gold Award stories you would like to share?\n\nEarlier this month, Daisy Rock Girl Guitars - the original girl guitar company - presented a girl guitar day to Girl Scouts during the week long Musicpalooza camp held at the Museum of Making Music in Carlsbad, CA.\n\nThe girl guitar day began in the Daisy Rock Girl Guitar museum exhibit with Daisy Rock Founder and President, Tish Ciravolo, showing the Girl Scouts her signature Daisy electric guitar that was inducted in 2006 as a landmark, culture-changing music product innovation. The campers learned about what makes the guitar a “girl guitar” - the “Slim & Narrow” neck that fits girls hands and is easier to play, the lightweight design that makes the guitar easier for girls to hold and play, and colorful inspiring designs. Campers then gathered around tables to draw their very own girl guitars. Sounds totally awesome to me!\n\nMore awesome is the evidence illustrating the positive effects children can gain from participating in music oriented programs. In an analysis of U.S. Department of Education data on more than 25,000 secondary school students, researchers found that students who report consistent high levels of involvement in instrumental music over the middle and high school years show \"significantly higher levels of mathematics proficiency by grade 12.\" This observation holds regardless of students' socio-economic status, and differences in those who are involved with instrumental music vs. those who are not is more significant over time.

The article points out the money needed to fund such extracurricular activities is increasingly scarce, denying the next generation of students the same opportunities she enjoyed.\n\nFulfilling a project that’s been two years in the making, Williams has brought together three local nonprofit agencies to teach music to kids from lower-income families in Thousand Oaks.

Leader Kathy Riehs started this group in the spring of 2008 because of her daughter Emma's autism.\n\nMembers of Troop 200 are expected to follow Girl Scouts guidelines for earning patches, providing community services and attending events together as a group. With 13 members - the troop is looking to expand. According to the article, Western DuPage Recreation Association is the organization to contact for more information. Kudos to everyone involved!\n\nAs briefly mentioned before, California's Modesto Bee recently took a fantastic look at the Hispanic-Latina Initiative rolled out by The Girl Scouts Heart of Central California. It highlights the benefits of girls getting to see their Spanish-speaking moms in leadership positions, so they can better visualize themselves heading everything from Girl Scout troops to companies in the future. There is also a cool slide show including pictures of Girl Scouts making eggshell mosaics of things that pertain to various aspects of their Hispanic culture.

In Hispanic cultures, the quinceañera coming-of-age ceremony marks the transition from girl to womanhood.

The six-week program is designed for girls ages 14 to 16, with activities like community service, and lessons in goal-setting, etiquette, personal hygiene, health and nutrition, and cultural traditions. The Fiesta de Quiceañera, in its third year, also symbolizes graduation from the program. Held at a ballroom this year, the reception featured music, Mexican food, cake, flower arrangements and professional photography. The girls wore traditional princess dresses, tiaras and pink tennis shoes. They later slipped into high heels with the help of their parents, a typical component of quince ceremonies.

The group of about 20 was initially separated into four smaller groups and each table of girls was responsible for drawing the shell of a girl.

The Changing Face of Fashion was directed and shot by lifestyle and beauty photographer Cathrine Westergaard. As a part of a new initiative at Girl Scouts to address the image of girls in the media, The Changing Face of Fashion is supported by Beauty Redefined: Girls and Body Image Survey (2010), a study conducted by The Girl Scout Research Institute.\n\nSo far the video has been picked up and broadcast at Seventeen, Tonic, Mom Logic, StyleList, The Cotillion, Strollerderby, Daily Venus Diva and many more. While many people understandably struggle with the term 'plus size', others appreciate the exposure girls will get to sizes larger than zero. One very interesting and telling article from iVillage points out an actual Girl Scout's comments from another Blog:\n\n“You want a story? Come look at my troop. We're a group of girls from ages\n\n11 to 18, and we can do anything. We have faced everything together. Divorces,\n\ncancer, a girl in a three-week coma, breakups and all the bumps and scrapes of\n\nteenage life. In high school, we have 18 girls in our troop. That's more\n\nimpressive when you consider there are 350 girls in my high school, and we're\n\nnot the only troop. We have girls going off to Ivy League schools and girls\n\ngoing to community college, girls of every weight, color, religion. Girls who\n\nhave rebuilt playgrounds, raised spina bifida awareness, rebuilt hiking trails,\n\ncreated award winning websites, and collected hundreds of thousands of coats for\n\nchildren with HIV. We are mighty. We go bellydancing, bowling, white water\n\nrafting, spelunking, and rock climbing. We learn from Ren Faire actors,\n\noccupational therapists, police women, pharmacists, and more. We support\n\nsoldiers in overseas hospitals with care packages and homemade quilts, cards and\n\nDVDs. We CHANGE THE WORLD. Us, ourselves. Don't look a gift horse in the\n\nmouth...a positive message for girls is a positive message, no matter who it\n\ncomes from, and we need more of that.”\n\nI certainly could not have made a better case than that!\n\nA busy summer for many Girl Scouts - Let's investigate:\n\nNebraska's York News Times has an awesome story about a group of Girl Scouts who saved money and traveled 4,300 miles across 16 different states, from Nebraska to Savannah, Georgia, Washington DC and Niagara Falls, NY.\n\nOhio's Bucyrus Telegraph Forum ran an op-ed explaining how much more there is to Girl Scouting than selling cookies.\n\nHuman Resource Executive reports that leaders at the Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council decided that a change in work environment was the right move for their workforce. It created organizational trust, resulted in more meaningful performance evaluations and increased worker initiative.\n\nThe Denville Neighborhood News, NJ, reports that Operation Cookie is still alive and well this summer - supplying cookies to US Troops abroad.\n\nIn California, The Santa Clarita Valley Signal reports that two Girl Scouts recently earned the prestigious Girl Scout Silver Award by making the front of the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center more attractive.\n\nEnjoy!"
