Based on actual events, the \"Weird!\" series presents three girls who act as the target, the passive bystander, and the bully in three separate titles. \"Weird!\" (Book 1) presents Luisa, who is ridiculed for being herself, for speaking Spanish, for having unusual taste (wearing polka dot boots), for laughing, for volunteering in math class, etc. The effect of this ridicule and verbal abuse on Luisa at first is to shut down her personality, as she seeks to maintain a lower profile to escape her bully. However, Luisa makes an astounding discovery: \"The more I act like I don't care what she says, the more I really don't care. And the more she thinks I don't care, the more she leaves me alone!\" This realization impels Luisa to take back her life and her vibrant personality, as she decides \"I guess I'll just be me from now on!\" \"Weird!\" is attractively illustrated and colorfully presented, with helpful notes at the end for each of the three main characters to remember in their struggles. There are also Confidence Club ideas and activities that will help children turn problems into opportunities for growth. An additional note to teachers, parents, and caring adults stresses important reflections and suggestions for ways to support children dealing with bullying. One note about cyber bullying especially warns adults of this added real though often hidden threatening behavior. \"Weird!\" (Book 1) is an excellent tool for teaching school age children good mental health techniques to survive and grow beyond bullying.

Wise children will listen and watch and learn its teachings well. Once a tiger was locked in a bamboo cage. When he saw a Brahman, or holy man, walking by, he appealed to his sense of compassion and asked him to let him out, promising he would be grateful. Of course, when the Brahman is persuaded to let the tiger out (against his better judgment), the tiger immediately threatens to eat him, denying the truthful significance of his promise of gratitude. Nevertheless, perhaps the tiger's lingering guilt intervenes, for the Brahman is allowed to seek out three other beings to determine if he ( the tiger) is being unfair. The Brahman then encounters a pipal tree, a buffalo, and a road, telling each his story of releasing the tiger who then threatens to eat him. Due to similar bitter experiences, each of these three beings advises the Brahman to meet his fate stoically and accept it. Disappointed and fearful, the Brahman happens upon a jackal. The jackal pretends to be a bit \"slow,\" asking to be taken to the tiger so he can understand the situation. Here comes the true trickster element of this morality tale, for when the jackal confronts the tiger, he actually confounds him and tricks him into getting back into the cage, all by pretending to be too slow to understand the story. Perhaps the moral is a warning against gullibility, but perhaps it also contains a seed of delight in the art and skills of the Trickster, who succeeds in achieving a desired outcome solely through skilled use of his wits. \"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal is an ancient Indian wisdom tale whose message is just as valuable today as it was hundreds of years ago. The story's imaginative, textured illustrations using fabric and color and collage enhance the exotic appeal of the fable.

'No, Auntie!
