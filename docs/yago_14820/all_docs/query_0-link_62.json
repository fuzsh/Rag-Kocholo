        "text": "The Struggles of Writer Wannabes by Paola M. and Amy C. (6th grade)\n\n(Kellee’s note: These girls are already writers, not wannabes, but they titled their piece, so I didn’t want to change it.)\n\nSo, you want to be a writer? Truth is, it’s not as easy as it seems. Take it from two author wannabes. We could come up with the greatest ideas, but as soon as we pick up the pencil or or place our hands on the keyboard we realize we have nothing to write! And this is only one example of the struggles authors go through every day.\n\nComing Up with Story Ideas\n\nEveryone comes up with ideas differently. You could be riding your bike when an idea about talking dogs talking over the wold hits you. But honestly the real problem isn’t how you come up with your ideas, it’s actually coming up with them.\n\nIf we’re being completely honest here, a big problem that writers like us have is coping with the planning stages of writing our stories. Now, I know you must be confused. What does planning have to do with coming up with ideas? Answer: Absolutely everything! Planning is basically thinking about the basic elements of your story (like theme and characters). What makes it especially difficult to deal with is the fact that you need to have everything ready to write. Which means you need to be able to explain your ideas off the bat if someone asks for your synopsis (that’s a fancy word for summary).\n\nAnother problem we have while coming up with our ideas is second-guessing ourselves. We keep questioning what we’ve written because we get nervous about what other people might think of our story or we start thinking about whether or not this is relevant to the story. Problems like these, fellow writers, is what causes writer’s block.\n\nWriter’s Block\n\nAh, writer’s block. Don’t take it personally but nobody likes you. Currently, we’re dealing with this mess which makes writing (very) hard. You’d think writing about writer’s block while having writer’s block (wow that’s a tongue twister) would make things easier for us. Sadly, that’s not the case.\n\nWriter’s block is pretty self explanatory. It’s when a writer can’t come up with new ideas or doesn’t know what to write next in his or her story. The problem about writer’s block is that no matter how hard you try you CANNOT come up with anything. You have to do something else to occupy your mind and get the creative juices flowing. The good thing is that while you’re doing chores (or anything else, for that matter) you can get some pretty amazing ideas. But sometimes doing something else can just be distracting.\n\nDistractions\n\nWe can’t wait for the live action Mulan movie (that has no songs whatsoever) to come out!!! Oops! Wrong blog post… As you can see from our totally off topic starter sentence, we’ll be talking about some distractions that get writers off their game.\n\nOne thing that distracts aspiring authors from writing is the Internet. People can get so distracted with videos, social media, Netflix, games, and researching stuff for their books they forget about the most important thing: WRITING!!! This happens most often when you write on the computer. You can be searching something up real quick and come across an article that is interesting enough to keep you off task.\n\nProcrastination plays a HUGE part here. Procrastination is the act of avoiding something. So basically when writers procrastinate they try to delay or avoid writing. Procrastination is a pretty big problem because we get absolutely no work done. And if you ever want to publish something… well let’s just say you can’t show an unfinished story to a publisher.\n\nThis is probably a very weird one but too much noise, or even no noise at all, can distract writers. If there’s too much noise some writers won’t be able to concentrate. But if there’s no noise at all it can make some writers weary and unable to focus on their writing. Distractions can also cause another problem: A hiccup in time management.\n\nNot Having Enough Time to Write\n\nAs we have previously mentioned, distractions can cause many problems. Like time management problems. Sometimes writers just can’t find enough time to sit down and actually write.\n\nFor us the biggest problem is having so much school work to finish. For others it might be actually having to go to work. Whatever the reason, may it be homework, your job, having to run errands or see family members, it’s hard to set apart some time to do what you love, which is (hopefully) writing. The worst part? If you have no time to write, then you probably have no time to edit.\n\nRevising and Editing\n\nEditing and revising are such a pain! And it gets even worse when you have no time to write. The problem is that it’s necessary. You need to edit and revise some parts of your story to get the best results for your book. Sometimes you need to cut out whole chapters or just fix a word to improve your story.\n\nEditing and revising is a multi-step process. You need to know what you need to change and then you have to have the time and patience to actually edit and revise your story. We usually dedicate a couple hours to a day of editing and revising, so that we can get most of that work off our to-do lists. But as we have said countless times before: People do things differently. And getting over these writing struggles is yet another example of that.\n\nIn Conclusion…\n\nFrom not being able to cook up some new ideas to not being able to write about those ideas, we have talked about some of the most painful struggles that we, as writers, go through every day. All of these things are hard to overcome and sometimes we might want to give up (Please don’t). In the end, though, this is all part of the story-making process and we kind of have to learn to deal with it.\n\nThank you to my wonderful students, Paola and Amy, for sharing your hilarious and thought-provoking reflections on being a kid writer!\n\nIt’s Monday! What Are You Reading? From Picture Books to YA!\n\nIt’s Monday! What are you Reading? is a meme started by Sheila at Book Journeys and now hosted by Kathryn at The Book Date. It is a great way to recap what you read and/or reviewed the previous week and to plan out your reading and reviews for the upcoming week. It’s also a great chance to see what others are reading right now…you just might discover the next “must-read” book!\n\nKellee and Jen, of Teach Mentor Texts, decided to give It’s Monday! What Are You Reading? a kidlit focus. If you read and review books in children’s literature – picture books, chapter books, middle grade novels, young adult novels, anything in the world of kidlit – join us! We love this meme and think you will, too.\n\nWe encourage everyone who participates to support the blogging community by visiting at least three of the other book bloggers that link up and leave comments for them.\n\nMonday: Special Announcement: 2018 Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award Finalists\n\nTuesday: Student Voices: Book Wishes by Ten of Kellee’s 2017-18 Middle School Students\n\nWednesday: The Day You Begin by Jacqueline Woodson\n\nThursday: Our Solar System by Arthur John L’Hommedieu\n\nFriday: Daring Dreamers Club #1: Milla Takes Charge by Erin Soderberg\n\n**Click on any picture/link to view the post**\n\nKellee\n\nBack to work part time this last week, but it was super fun: A SUMMER BOOK CLUB! For 4 days, a group of 20 students I spent time reading, talking about, and celebrating The Epic Fail of Arturo Zamora by Pablo Cartaya and Martí’s Song of Freedom by Emma Otheguy including having a party and virtually visiting with Pablo Cartaya:\n\nI also did find some reading time:\n\nEavesdropping on Elephants is Patricia Newman’s upcoming title, and it is so good, so I’ll definitely be reviewing it for you!\n\nPipsqueaks, Slowpokes, and Stinkers is just as good as you’d expect a Melissa Stewart book to be. I loved the focus on the underdog animals.\n\nIn the car, Trent and I found some new audiobooks on Hoopla to read to us while we drive to school: Pete the Cat and the Bad Banana and Babysitting Mode by Sarah Hernandez.\n\nI can’t stop reading Laurie Halse Anderson’s Vet Volunteers series. I love them! Great stories, fascinating characters, and wonderful animal lessons.\n\nWhat Girls are Made of by Elana K. Arnold is a book that I am so glad exists. It has so much that needs to be talked about that isn’t. It reminds me of Forever for modern day. And the Author’s Note at the end of the book is one of my favorite things ever written.\n\nI have been binging on (mostly middle grade) graphic novels this week, and they are all must gets! I posted them above in order of age appropriateness. Peter and Ernesto is an early reader graphic novel where Hey, Kiddo is young adult. The Cardboard Kingdom and Mr. Wolf’s Class are for primary and up while The Cobalt Prince and Raid of No Return are for late elementary and up. But they are all must reads and must gets if you teach the ages listed above.\n\nRicki\n\nThe family and I are spending some end-of-the-summer time together this weekend, so I decided to take a weekend break from the blog. I hope you all are enjoying some summer fun!\n\nKellee\n\nStill reading The Son of Neptune. It is a big book and with rotating other books through while reading it, it is taking a while.\n\nI started listening to Dumplin’ this week. Too soon to have an opinion.\n\nTrent, Jim, and I are reading Lucy by Randy Cecil, and I am loving this family reading time!\n\nLater Today: Special Announcement: 2018 Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award WINNER!\n\nTuesday: Student Voices: The Struggles of Writer Wannabes by Two of Kellee’s 2017-18 Middle School Students\n\nWednesday: The Kid’s Awesome Activity Book by Mike Lowery\n\nThursday: Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed\n\nFriday: Maximillian Villainous by Margaret Chiu Greanias\n\nLink up below and go check out what everyone else is reading.

Brava Erin SD for kicking off a new series for the younger MG set! Positive messages for kids! —Goodreads Praise\n\n“Young readers will be able to relate to the story, there is a positive message, and the characters provide a model of friendship, showing how friends work together and support on another. Loved meeting these girls!” —Goodreads Praise\n\nReview: I know that at first this book may seem like a book that only Disney or Princess lovers would like, but it is so much more than that! So please do not judge this book by that idea! Instead you will find a story about girls who find a deep friendship within each other after being placed in a group at school together. With the guidance of an amazing educator, they look deep within themselves and join as a group while still celebrating their individuality.\n\nNow, as someone who DOES love Disney and Disney princesses, I loved the angle that this book took! After the first assignment by their group teacher, the girls are asked to write about a princess who they connect with. Milla and her friends are using the strengths of the princesses as inspiration to build their own strengths. For example, Milla feels like her life is very sheltered, and she loves to write, so she finds inspiration in Belle. Ruby, who is athletic and prides herself in her strength, first struggles to connect with a princess but then she realizes that Mulan is a person that is very much who she would like to be. And each girl does her own reflection (written in her own words in a journal format).\n\nThis first book focuses on Milla, but we get to know all the girls through the inclusion of the journals and from Milla’s point of view. I assume that future books will also be in different points of view to allow readers to get to know more in depth each of the characters. I look forward to future books to see where Piper, Milla, Mariana, Ruby, Zahra and Ms. Bancroft go next!\n\nTeachers’ Tools for Navigation: I love Ms. Bancroft! And I think that how she had the girls introduce themselves and her first assignment that she gave the Daring Dreamers Club would be wonderful activities in a classroom:\n\n“I’d love for each of you to introduce yourself and share one of your big dreams.”\n\n“I want each of you to think of a princess you connect with or feel inspired by and explain why. Dig deep and really think about your answer.”\n\nSince each of the girls’ answers are shared in the book, they would be a great thing to share as well.\n\nIn addition, this book is going to be LOVED by realistic fiction fans! I cannot wait to share it with my students.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhich of the five main characters do you connect with the most?\n\nIf you had to choose a princess you connect with, who would you choose?\n\nDo you think Milla went about getting her moms to trust her correctly?\n\nHow does Ms. Bancroft inspire the girls? How is she different than the last music teacher?\n\nWhat is one of your big dreams?\n\nFlagged Passages: “Milla loved reading and writing just about anything, but there was nothing she enjoyed more than creating adventures for herself. In Milla’s stories, she was always a brave hero without fears or worries of any kind. One of the things Milla most loved about writing was that she was totally in charge and got to make all the decisions about what would happen on her adventures. The only limitation was her imagination, and her imagination was vast.” (p. 6)\n\nRead This If You Love: Baby-Sitters Club by Ann M. Martin, Harbor Me by Jacqueline Woodson, Be Prepared by Vera Brosgol, Whatever After by Sarah Mlynowski\n\nRecommended For:\n\nDisney’s Dream Big, Princess–Be a Champion Campaign:\n\n**Thank you to Sydney at Penguin Random House for providing a copy for review!**\n\nThe Day You Begin\n\nAuthor: Jacqueline Woodson\n\nIllustrator: Rafael López\n\nPublication Date: August 28th, 2018 by Nancy Paulsen Books\n\nSummary: National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson and two-time Pura Belpre Illustrator Award winner Rafael López have teamed up to create a poignant, yet heartening book about finding courage to connect, even when you feel scared and alone.\n\nThere will be times when you walk into a room\n\nand no one there is quite like you.\n\nThere are many reasons to feel different. Maybe it’s how you look or talk, or where you’re from; maybe it’s what you eat, or something just as random. It’s not easy to take those first steps into a place where nobody really knows you yet, but somehow you do it.\n\nJacqueline Woodson’s lyrical text and Rafael López’s dazzling art reminds us that we all feel like outsiders sometimes-and how brave it is that we go forth anyway. And that sometimes, when we reach out and begin to share our stories, others will be happy to meet us halfway.\n\nKellee’s Review: A beautiful book about the power of differences while also acknowledging the challenges that feeling as if you don’t fit in cause. I loved that the story was not exactly narrative but instead of a snapshot into multiple kids’ lives to help show different examples of differences. We are all unique and that is what makes this book and our world beautiful!\n\nWoodson’s lyrical language with Lopez’s collage and colorful illustration makes this book a piece of art that is going to bridge gaps, help students think about others, give readers a mirror and a window, and build empathy in all that read it.\n\nRicki’s Review: A great many kids and adults will find solace in the text. The writing and illustrations are stunning. Every once in a while, a book comes around like this one. It is simply magical. I don’t often purchase bound copies of my F&Gs, but I knew I needed to pre-order this one after I read it. It is a great book for teachers to read on the first day. The emotional impact is powerful. Everyone has felt excluded at some time or another, and this book digs deeply into that emotion and pushes readers to analyze that feeling and push through it to find strength and resolve. I am having a difficult time conveying the power of this book. I promise you will love it.\n\nTeachers’ Tools for Navigation: Building classroom community around kindness and empathy is essential in building a safe, trusting environment for our students, and this text will be a perfect addition to any text set you have that focuses on these topics. In addition to these social-emotional impacts, the text allows for talks of theme, mood, and author’s intent.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat is one way that you feel very different than most people around you? How could people support you? How could you support others who feel different?\n\nWhat examples of people’s differences did Woodson highlight in the story?\n\nWhat was the mood for the first large portion of the text?\n\nWhat is the theme of the book?\n\nWhy do you think the author felt compelled to write this book?\n\nWhy are differences important in our community? Nation? Classroom?\n\nFlagged Passages:\n\nRead This If You Love: Each Kindness by Jacqueline Woodson, I Walk With Vanessa by Kerascoët, Normal Norman by Tara Lazar, Adrian Simcox Does Not Have a Horse by Marcy Campbell, What Can a Citizen Do? by Dave Eggers, Pink is for Boys by Rob Pearlman, Come with Me by Holly McGhee, We’re All Wonders by R.J.
