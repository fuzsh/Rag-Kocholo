Lisa Bisogno, Tamra Day, and Jarilyn Haney presented “Special Education and Related Topics” for Chouteau-Mazie Public Schools.\n\nProfessor of Education Karen Carey and former NSU Honors student Ms. Lauren York worked together through a six-credit hour arranged research course as advisor and mentee. In Summer 2022 their research was submitted and accepted for publication to a scholarly journal, the Academic Exchange Quarterly. Their work is being published in the Winter 2022/2023 edition. The title of their publication is “Gifted Education through the Lens of Legislation”.\n\nThe purpose of this action research study was to evaluate enrichment and gifted education programs in an Oklahoma public school district in comparison to Oklahoma State Department of Education guidelines. The research question which led the study was “Is the current gifted education legislation in Oklahoma effective in compelling Oklahoma public schools to provide the necessary level of academic enrichment for identified gifted and talented students?” The results of the survey demonstrated the perceived necessity of prioritizing pre-college gifted education programs in elementary, middle, and high schools.\n\nResearch on the topic led to three major themes. First, administrators are not confident in the programs they provide for gifted education. Second, administrators have a strong concern over energy and time spent to create meaningful learning experiences. Third, Oklahoma legislators need to offer direction for public schools through stronger gifted legislation, and funding should be greater and allocated exclusively to schools who have data indicating they are complying with more rigorous gifted education laws.\n\nBy creating and sustaining gifted programs supported by strong legislation, increased funding, and highly trained teachers, Oklahoma can better serve gifted students who may eventually serve society through their future careers. The benefits of this study outweighed the risks and the researchers presented data indicating that schools fall short in providing educational resources for gifted students. Another theme insinuated inconsistency exists in offering adequate services through funding to all groups of students.\n\nMs. Jameie Combs hosted a cookout with students and members of the Deaf community, held a monthly coffee chat with a record attendance of 41, hosted an ASL informational fair, and participated in the first language exchange with Sign Language students from the Catholic University of Malawi.\n\nMs. Jameie Combs was recently appointed to the Oklahoma Baptist Deaf Ministry Task Force.

We are continuing our spotlight series in which we highlight current practices being done in several NSU programs to inspire our readers. For November, we are discussing the BBA Business Administration Plan.\n\nAt NSU, we are committed to preparing students to be career-ready. In doing so, we have designed our programs to bridge the gap between institutional outcomes and the employer skill set. To guide this practice, career services recommends the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE, competency list that encourages a career-ready mindset. These competencies were developed with employers to create a list of transferable skills actively being sought out in employee candidates. In the Assessment office, we help to provide support for these competencies using our institutional learning outcomes, the Degrees of Excellence.\n\nNovember Program Highlight: BBA Business Administration Plan - Dr. Lisa Czlonka\n\nOur team met with Dr. Czlonka and her team during a Leadership conference. During this meeting, Dr. Czlonka discussed new exciting ventures the BBA Business Administration Plan and other Programs at CBT are moving towards in hopes of better preparing graduates for career opportunities.\n\nNovember Institutional Outcome Highlight: Outcome # 2: Integrative Knowledge\n\nProduce, independently or collaboratively, an investigative, creative or practical work that draws on specific theories, evidence, tools and methods from diverse perspectives.\n\nNovember Competency Highlight: NACE LEADERSHIP\n\nRecognize and capitalize on personal and team strengths to achieve organizational goals.\n\nHow Business Administration is supporting these Outcomes and Competency\n\nDuring the leadership meeting, Dr. Czlonka stated that the DOE Integrative Knowledge is measured by a variety of assessments. Students complete a team project and a peer evaluation as the primary summative assessment. Several formative assessments are embedded in class assignments that apply several evaluative tools to assess various factors influencing successful teamwork and leadership development, including tools to identify team approaches to managing diverse perspectives. As for the BBA Business Administration Plan, the main focus for students is to improve their leadership skills, accomplishing the NACE competency for Leadership. The NACE Leadership outcome aligns to the outcomes and assignments embedded in the Management and Team Skills course, located within the BBA Business Administration Plan Program. CBT is planning on making these courses required within this program.\n\nAnother additional task that measures student progress toward the DOE Integrative Knowledge outcome and the NACE competency is the inclusion of a new simulation exercise. When asked how the simulation will operate, Dr. Dilene Crockett had this to say:\n\nAll College of Business students run a simulated international company as their capstone to the common business core courses. They must make decisions for every area of a business including marketing, management, accounting, finance, operations, human resources, etc. Students are able to apply all of the concepts and skills they have collected through their course of study in the College. Since the simulation is played in business schools around the globe, faculty can pull assessment data against referent groups such as schools across the globe, North American, Oklahoma, or against all NSU students who have done the simulation over the last 15 years. Results are also available across business disciplines and by major.\n\nThe NSU Assessment Team sends a large thank you to Dr. Czlonka for allowing us the time to spotlight her program.\n\nWhat else is going on in the world of Assessment\n\nThe Assessment Team is currently working on compiling the Student Learning Assessment Reports for the OSRHE accreditation process. We want to thank everyone involved within this reporting process. Your patience and understanding has helped to make this process as smooth as possible!\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.\n\nThe NSU Assessment team is here to connect staff to best practices in assessment, aligning curriculum to match both course and institutional outcomes - whether it be syllabus, BB course prep or linking your assessments to measure within Anthology.

To guide this practice, career services recommends the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE, competency list that encourages a career-ready mindset. These competencies were developed with employers to create a list of transferable skills actively being sought out in employee candidates. In the Assessment office, we help to provide support for these competencies using our institutional learning outcomes, the Degrees of Excellence.\n\nOctober Program Highlight: B.A.Ed. English Education - Dr. Lara Searcy\n\nOur team met with Dr. Searcy to discuss current practices within the English Education program. Dr. Searcy is currently endeavoring to update the English Education program in response to national accreditation standards updates and in reaction to current student needs. The purpose of this re-work is to involve students in their higher education and to ensure the program is exceeding the standards set by their accreditation, the National Council for Teachers of English, or NCTE.\n\nOctober Institutional Outcome Highlight: DOE Citizenship\n\n5.1 Analyze the advantages and challenges of a culturally diverse society\n\nOctober Competency Highlight: NACE Equity & Inclusion\n\nDemonstrate the awareness, attitude, knowledge, and skills required to equitably engage and include people from different local and global cultures. Engage in anti-racist practices that actively challenge the systems, structures, and policies of racism.\n\nHow English Education is supporting this Outcome and Competency\n\nNCTE recently updated their outcomes and expectations to include more anti-racist language. The NSU English Education program has worked tirelessly to ensure equity and inclusion in its coursework so that students are able to “demonstrate knowledge of learners and learning that fosters inclusive learning environments”. The best example of this new focus is the inclusion of a new required course “Social Justice Literacies.” Starting as just a topic within the Teaching English in Secondary Schools course, Dr. Searcy noticed the desire for more discussion on this topic from her students and created a one-hour course for students within the program, Critical Issues in English Education. Again, this begat an even stronger desire for more information, so “Social Justice Literacies” was then created and offered as a three-hour elective. After positive feedback from students, this course is now required for all in the English Education program-- though it is interdisciplinary. When asked how the course focuses on assessment, Dr. Searcy had this to say:\n\nThe Assessment starts with a personal narrative where teacher candidates explore and then write about their own journeys toward social justice consciousness. An “orientation” is a person’s beliefs or attitudes toward a subject. Once a person’s social justice consciousness is heightened, it is likely that their social justice orientation (SJO) will increase as well. Attaining a heightened SJO involves three components: a) embracing personal history; b) sympathizing with other people’s histories; and c) a desire to end oppression of the marginalized (Sanford, 2019, p. 3). Starting with self-reflection with one’s personal history is a necessary beginning for anti-racist/anti-bias work because we know how “our own identities and experiences frame our practices and impact our teaching of ELA” (NCTE, 2021, Standard 5). From our personal history, we are then able to “apply and demonstrate knowledge of learners and learning to foster inclusive learning environments that support [...] antiracist/antibias teaching” by creating Anti-Racist Book Clubs and then “ plan, implement, and assess [...] antiracist/antibias instruction” through the creation of content unit plans that are focused on diverse text selection that relates to the diversity of the students in their field experience setting (NCTE 2021). (Assessment Report Focus).\n\nFurthermore, in response to student feedback, Dr. Searcy and an Honor student within this program endeavored to create a safe space for students to discuss topics, so they established “NSU Read Club.” The Honor student saw a need for LGBTQIA+ inclusivity and, as part of an action project for the English Education program, established a book club that is open to all NSU students. For more information, please visit their website (link below).\n\nThe NSU Assessment Team sends a large thank you to Dr. Searcy for allowing us the time to spotlight her program.\n\nWhat else is going on in the world of Assessment\n\nThanks to you all, we have been able to keep on schedule in our accreditation process. As many of you are aware, the Student Learning Assessment Reports were due September 15th. Our office is currently compiling these reports to submit to OSRHE and to HLC for our annual report.

The partnership also opens the door to career advice, internships, and employment opportunities for our students.\n\nYou mention all students. Is the NSA interested in disciplines such as art, history, and music?\n\nAbsolutely. The NSA sorts through tons of information on a daily basis. Without experts in different disciplines, it is impossible to understand the information. For example, vital information may be hidden in a simple piece of art, music, or photo of an athlete. Someone with that type of knowledge is critical in identifying the hidden information. Similarly, a history major understands cultural, historical, and religious patterns that might be critical in interpreting future actions that might be taken by a hostile group of individuals.\n\nWhere might I obtain more information regarding the internship and employment opportunities?\n\nThe USAJOBS National Security Agency webpage lists current internship and employment opportunities.\n\nAs of today, NSA was seeking individuals to fill positions such as a Budget Analyst, Business Financial Manager, NSA Police Officer, Compliance Officer, Psychologist, Contracting Specialist, Business Consultant, Cryptographic Expert, Network Exploitation Target Analyst, Audit Specialist, and an Applied Social Scientist. However, check the above listed website as job listings change.\n\nWhat are some of the free resources provided by the NSA to our students?\n\nA good place to start is the NSA Press Room. I enjoyed the 9/8/22 article on Robotics and the 9/28/22 article on the National Cryptologic Museum Grand Opening.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Advisories and Guidance webpage provides good articles on China, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Securing the Software Supply Chain, Cyber Tools, and Ransomware.\n\nContact Dr. Mike Wilds at wilds@nsuok.edu for more more information.\n\nCollege of Business & Technology\n\nCollege of Education\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts\n\nGregg Wadley College of Science & Health Professions\n\nAssessment Corner\n\nCenter for Tribal Studies\n\nCollege of Extended Learning\n\nLibraries\n\nOffice of International Programs\n\nResearch & Sponsored Programs\n\nAcademic Spotlight\n\nNSU, Premier Logistics awarded Oklahoma Impact Partnership Grant\n\nNSU PRESS RELEASE\n\nTAHLEQUAH, Okla. — Northeastern State University has received an Oklahoma Impact Partnership Grant from the Oklahoma Office of Workforce Development to promote high demand careers in the supply chain industry.\n\nNSU and corporate partner Premier Logistics were among six 2022 Impact Partnership Grant recipients announced this year. Overall, the pair was awarded $164,500. Premier Logistics has a consortium of supply chain logistics companies, community partners and education partners who help to make a significant and lasting contribution to the workforce in this industry.\n\n“These grants give business/industry and higher education an opportunity to work together to promote high demand careers that are hard to fill positions in the workforce,” NSU Dean of the College of Business & Technology Dr. Janet Buzzard said. “NSU's College of Business & Technology offers 22 online certificates in these areas that a working employee can take to upskill into these skilled positions.”\n\nBuzzard added the certificates were designed as a way to meet workforce gaps created by new technologies and retirements.\n\nThis is the second grant NSU and Premier Logistics have received to help grow workforce opportunities in the supply chain industry. The previous grant awarded was for $100,000.\n\nBuzzard said one highlight from last year’s grant was organizing the Supply Chain Conference at the NSU-Broken Arrow campus. The conference, delayed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brought together experts from the industry and government at the NSU-Broken Arrow campus in May to explore challenges facing the supply chain sector. This included exploring ways to reestablish and protect business’ supply chains, recruiting, retaining and developing a dynamic workforce and discussing innovations and opportunities in the sector.\n\nAs part of the partnership, several scholarships were awarded last year to high school, career tech and university students to pursue careers in supply chain. There were also presentations to high schoolers regarding careers in supply chains and industry tours to provide further insight into the supply chain sector.\n\nBuzzard said this year’s grant will allow NSU and their corporate partner to further build upon those efforts.\n\n“The purpose of Impact Partnership Grants is to connect business and industry with workforce services through local collaboration and leadership. The application process was a road map for success and the five awardees are on their way to making a lasting difference for Oklahoma’s workforce. Special thanks to the Governor’s Council for making these grants possible,” Executive Director of the Oklahoma Office of Workforce Development Don Morris said in a press release announcing this year’s recipients.\n\nTo learn more about this workforce partnership visit https://www.supplychainconferenceok.com/.\n\n###\n\nPsychology and Counseling\n\nDr. Bea Keller-Dupree, from the Department of Psychology & Counseling, was interviewed by TulsaKids Magazine to learn how parents can support goal-setting for children of all-ages.

We are continuing our spotlight series in which we highlight current practices being done in several NSU programs to inspire our readers. For September, we are discussing the BSN Nursing program.\n\nAt NSU, we are committed to preparing students to be career-ready. In doing so, we have designed our programs to bridge the gap between institutional outcomes and the employer skill set. To guide this practice, career services recommends the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE, competency list that encourages a career-ready mindset. These competencies were developed with employers to create a list of transferable skills actively being sought out in employee candidates. In the Assessment office, we help to provide support for these competencies using our institutional learning outcomes, the Degrees of Excellence.\n\nSeptember Program Highlight: SHP BSN Nursing - Dr. April Nelson\n\nOur team met with Dr. Nelson to discuss current practices within the Nursing program. Dr. Nelson is currently re-working the Nursing program to better support the students within the workforce. The goal of this re-work is to create connections between the student’s previous experiences and current practices within the Nursing workforce and workplace.\n\nSeptember Institutional Outcome Highlight: DOE 1.5 Communication fluency\n\nConstruct coherent written and oral arguments for general and specific audiences;\n\nConstruct coherent written and oral narratives for general and specific audiences;\n\nCollaborate with others to advance an argument or design an approach to resolving a social, personal or ethical dilemma.\n\nSeptember Competency Highlight: NACE Communication\n\nClearly and effectively exchange information, ideas, facts, and perspectives with persons inside and outside of an organization.\n\nHow Nursing is supporting these Outcomes and Competency\n\nDuring the meeting, Dr. Nelson was gracious enough to provide an in-depth look as to what the program is currently doing to support communication. As mentioned previously, the Nursing program is currently being re-worked to better support the newly improved outcomes that were freshly developed during the Summer of 2022. In doing so, Dr. Nelson has taken great care to ensure that updated terms and diverse language were introduced and incorporated into the pedagogy of several courses to ensure inclusion and student support. By utilizing current terms, the Nursing program can better prepare their students for the workplace and create scenarios that they may encounter during their internships and practicums.\n\nAnother exciting aspect of the Nursing program is the research initiative championed throughout a student’s time at NSU. The goal of this opportunity is for students to research underrepresented or vulnerable populations within their area of study and propose how to create inclusion. This can be accomplished either through field reporting, volunteer opportunities, or other initiatives created by the student. Dr. Nelson provided an excellent example of a recent research initiative where several students collaborated on creating inclusion for those who identify within the LGBTQIA + community and presented this research to the Nursing community. Not only did this support the outcomes within the Nursing program and the outcomes discussed within this article, it also created an authentic assessment opportunity for the students to actively participate and practice learned concepts from within the classroom. This research initiative has met great success within the program and those involved are eager for this semester’s students to get involved.\n\nThe NSU Assessment Team sends a large thank you to Dr. Nelson for allowing us the time to spotlight her program.\n\nWhat else is going on in the world of Assessment\n\nIt’s that time of year, everyone! The Student Learning Assessment Reports are due September 15, 2022. Please ensure that your report is turned in on time. We will continue the practice of submitting the report through Anthology Portfolio (formerly Chalk & Wire).\n\nInformation to Note:\n\nPrograms are expected to report the alignment of their program outcomes to the Degrees of Excellence Institutional Learning Outcomes. The Graduate Council is piloting an advanced set of institutional outcomes, written at the competency level expected of graduate-level students. If you are completing a report form for a graduate-level degree program, please refer to the Graduate Degrees of Excellence outcomes.\n\nWe are using the assessment report to gather evidence on program immersive/experiential learning opportunities. If you have a required experience, such as a required field experience, practicum, capstone, research experience, or another immersive/experiential requirement, please report this in the program learning outcome assessment section.\n\nThis year we are incorporating the Co-curricular assessment report into the same report form so that you only need to complete one form. If your program offers a voluntary immersive/experiential learning opportunity, this is a co-curricular program, such as Model United Nations, IDEA (robotics), VITA, voluntary internship programs or courses, or other formal co-curricular experiences, please report this in the co-curricular learning outcomes assessment section.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out. You can also schedule an appointment with one of the Graduate Assistants, see below, and they can help to walk you thr"
