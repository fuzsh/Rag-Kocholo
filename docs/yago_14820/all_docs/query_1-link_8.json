        "text": "Once upon a time, Abby and her little brother, Jonah, were ordinary kids. The next minute? The mirror in their basement slurped them up and magically transported them into the fairy tale of Snow White.\n\nYes, really!\n\nWhen Abby and Jonah stop Snow from eating the poison apple, they think they're heroes. But wait! If Snow doesn't die, she won't meet her prince and get her happy ending. Oops.\n\nNow it's up to Abby and Jonah-- with some help from Snow and the seven dwarfs--to outwit the witch and save the famous fairy tale in time.\n\nBut what if Snow's REAL happy ending is something else entirely?\n\nBestselling author Sarah Mlynowski and award-winning illustrator Anu Chouhan join forces to bring us this vibrant, action-packed, enchanting graphic novel adventure that will appeal to fans of fairy tales, Raina Telgemeier, The Land of Stories, and all magical, empowering adventures. (From Graphix)\n\nFairest of All is for ages 8 to 12.\n\nSarah Mlynowski is a writer from Montreal, living in Los Angeles. She has written numerous books including the Whatever After series and the Magic in Manhattan series.\n\nAnu Chouhan is a Punjabi-Canadian illustrator and video game artist. Chouhan illustrated the graphic novel adaptation of the book Aru Shah and the End of Time and is working on her first picture book. She lives in Vancouver."
