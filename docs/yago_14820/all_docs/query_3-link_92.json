        "text": "Books containing stories by Nicola Kraus\n\nNicola Kraus recommends\n\nCity People (2023)\n\nElizabeth Topp\n\n\"In this haunting novel, Topp delicately peels back the gilt layers of privilege to expose the true cost of living amid Manhattan's 1 percent, where the things that matter - ease, self-esteem, and love - are always tantalizingly out of reach... promised in the next purchase, the next investment, but never delivered. Topp dares to ask, If your child's admission to an elite school could be an entree into this world, would you take it? Should you?\"\n\nThe Lifestyle (2022)\n\nTaylor Hahn\n\n\"This hilarious, wildly sexy book was impossible to put down. Hahn has created a memorable heroine, a strong woman trying to navigate life on her terms - until she finally realizes the key to getting what she really wants is letting go.\"\n\nBoth Are True (2021)\n\nReyna Marder Gentin\n\n\"In this moving novel, Gentin examines what it means to start over at a time in life when most people seem to have it 'figured out.' As Jackie and Lou try to move on without each other, they are forced to reexamine all their choices-with surprising consequences.\"\n\nCompetitive Grieving (2021)\n\nNora Zelevansky\n\n\"Is it strange to find a book about loss such a joyous affirmation of what makes life worth the struggle? With her irrepressible wit and warmth, Zelevansky perfectly captures the vortex that follows a shocking loss, while also reminding us that even on the hardest days there is always the possibility of finding redemption, forgiveness, and even love.\"\n\nThe Subway Girls (2018)\n\nSusie Orman Schnall\n\n\"A charming, inspiring tale, crossing two generations of ambitious young women, striving against the odds to make their mark, find happiness--and figure out, decades apart, if it's ever possible to do both.\"\n\n#Hockeystrong (2017)\n\nErika Robuck\n\n\"This hilarious spot-on satire takes you inside where so many of us parents get hijacked into spending our time and money-the sidelines.\"\n\nThis Was Not the Plan (2016)\n\nCristina Alger\n\n\"With compassion and humor Cristina Alger delves into the lure of the 1%, while deftly exposing the cost that life exactsÂ—a cost beyond price.\"\n\nMore recommendations\n\nVisitors also looked at these authors"
