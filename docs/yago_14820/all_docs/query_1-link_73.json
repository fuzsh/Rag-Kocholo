But she gets more than she bargained for when a magpie guides her to a magical room containing books that she can not only read, but also live in. Silva finds herself in the worlds of the characters, who turn out to be real people. People she knows. Thereâ€™s a catch, though: she soon discovers that the magpie has lured her to these books for selfish and dark reasons.\n\nKate Blair is a native of Hayling Island, United Kingdom, and is now a Canadian citizen living in Toronto, Ontario. She is the author of such bestselling, acclaimed books as Transferral and Tangled Planet and has received numerous award nominations for her work. For more information, visit www.kateblair.com."
