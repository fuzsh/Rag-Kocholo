        "text": "A Green Velvet Secret:\n\nA Green Velvet Secret by Vicki Grant (2023) is a Canadian middle grade book about the bond between Yardley (YaYa) and her grandmother (Gidge). Unfortunately Gidge has terminal cancer and soon Yardley and her parents are on their own, with just letters written by Gidge to serve as guidance and support.\n\nTypically a middle grade novel, unless it's one that's set during a holiday trip or involves nomadic people, features some time at school. Or at least, interactions with school children. Sometimes it can seem that a book is set too much at school.\n\nHere, though, Yardley seems to live in a vacuum. Beyond a brief description of her home, the thrift store where she ends up working, the hospital, the graveyard, and the Pit of Despair, there's nothing else to her world. There isn't even a good sense of how these settings connect together except vaguely by bus and scooter.\n\nThe people in Yardley's life are few and far between too. There are her parents who get a brief description early on and then are just sort of in the wings. There's of course Gidge who is the driving force of the novel, alive and even dead. There is the adult and the teenaged boy who also work at the thrift shop. And finally there's the woman who is given the titular green velvet dress. That's it.\n\nThe other people in Yardley's life seem to be as disjointed and disconnected from any greater reality as the places she visits. Save for a brief bit of characterization near the end, not much is said or learned about any of the living people.\n\nBut the thing that ultimately didn't work for me is Yardley's naivetÃ©. She goes through the vast majority of the book believing in reincarnation, in the form often used in isekai stories in anime/manga where a dead person is transported to another world fully formed and very much alive, albeit often in a different body. Though there is nothing to the book to support Yardley's conviction, she repeatedly sees her dead grandmother in others she meets.\n\nMy initial review on finishing the book sums up my feelings. \"Yardley, aka YaYa is so stubbornly naive all the way through. She out-pollyannas Pollyanna.\"\n\nTwo stars"
