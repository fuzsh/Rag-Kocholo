        "text": "I usually like magic realism, spiritual, or fantasy books but after reading Sabrina Greenlee’s memoir “Grant Me Vision,” I shall no longer be overlooking memoirs because sometimes real-life stories could be more impactful than fiction.\n\nI felt that this memoir was unputdownable! Greenlee’s story is one of the saddest I’ve ever known. Throughout her life, she puts up with the most unimaginable suffering and yet chooses a life of faith and healing. She is sexually abused as a child, suffers domestic violence, loss of loved ones, and finally, an acid attack leaves her blind and broken with four kids.\n\nBut it’s also one of the most inspirational stories because after losing sight she gains sublime vision and manages to turn her life around. She also emerges as a strong mother and raises star athletes, including NFL sensation DeAndre Hopkins (the book includes his foreword).\n\nWhen I received the review copy, the only part I noticed on the cover was an elegant lady. I had no idea that Sabrina Greenlee was blind, a survivor, and had undergone so much pain! After reading the blurb, I looked at her picture closely. I was curious about how the lady emerged as a nationally recognized inspirational speaker, life coach, and community activist. The memoir did not disappoint, and every word made perfect sense.\n\nThe book has the power to touch people’s lives and inspire them to “assert their power and find faith to have strength even when the future seems hopeless.” The memoir is not only relatable to those who are entangled in a loop of abusive relationships, messy choices, violence, and illegal jobs but also to those seeking inward support, faith, and vision.\n\nMy Review\n\nI loved the stark honesty, gripping narration, and depiction of the author’s life in the 70s in a black neighborhood in America. I also loved the message in the book – “And so I ask myself every day: Would I trade my vision if I could have my sight.” I can already see that this real-life story has the full potential of becoming a Hollywood film. Max stars!\n\n(Thank you to the publisher @HarperCollins for the review copy. This is not a paid advertisement and opinions expressed are my own)\n\nMost fairy tale lovers know the origin of the term “Fairest of All.” And seeing it as the title of the latest “Whatever After” graphic novel series (Publisher: Graphix, Scholastic) I was intrigued.\n\nWhat was Snow White doing in this graphic book with two kids Abby and Jonah?\n\nIt certainly felt like a fairy tale with a twist, or popularly known as a “fractured fairy-tale.” I skimmed through the pages of this first “graphic novel,” based on the New York Times bestselling Whatever After” novels, and was quite impressed.\n\nThe Blurb\n\nOnce upon a time, Abby and her little brother, Jonah, were ordinary kids. The next minute? The mirror in their basement slurped them up and magically transported them into the fairy tale of Snow White.\n\nYes, really!\n\nWhen Abby and Jonah stop Snow from eating the poison apple, they think they’re heroes. But wait! If Snow doesn’t die, she won’t meet her prince and get her happy ending. Oops.\n\nNow it’s up to Abby and Jonah– with some help from Snow and the seven dwarfs–to outwit the witch and save the famous fairy tale in time.\n\nBut what if Snow’s REAL happy ending is something else entirely?\n\nFamily Review\n\nAfter reading it, I felt the bestselling author Sarah Mlynowski has created quite a wonderful story with its myriad twists and turns. Illustrator and animator Anu Chouhan does a great job adapting the novel with her action-packed, vibrant and fun graphics.\n\nMy kids loved the story, pictures and the cool fairy-talish packaging of the book.\n\nI am more used to reading fairy tales with beautiful pictures of Cinderellas and Rapunzels, the castles and witches. But this book didn’t disappoint.\n\nYou can check out Snow White’s picture, isn’t she cute and relatable to the current gen?\n\nAnd the evil step mother looks the part too. Although, the two characters who accidentally enter the fairy tale and disrupt it are not scared of her.\n\nThe book’s target audience is kids from the age 8 to 12 but I think it will appeal to fairy tales lovers of all ages. Go for it if you love fairy tales or looking for an engrossing fun read!\n\nThank you @Graphixbooks and @Scholastic for the review copy. Great going @sarahmlynowski @anumationart, @anumation\n\nLike many other immigrants, I am naturally curious to know more about others who came before me from India to the US, especially to Minnesota. Today, my search led me to an extraordinary individual, Dr. Vaman Ramachandra Kokatnur (1887-1951), a University of Minnesota alumnus and a brilliant chemical engineer, who had more than 30 patents to his credit.\n\nWhat was extraordinary about him were his efforts to revive the glory of India in the field of chemistry. This was the time when India was under British rule.\n\nIn the 1920s, Kokatnur shared many pertinent and astonishing scientific findings with the Western world, which made them sit up and acknowledge the scientific advancement of ancient India.\n\nHis works related to astonishing knowledge from India, include, “The Hieroglyphics Findings of the Origin of Chemistry,” “Were Priestley and Cavendish the First Discoverers of Oxygen and Hydrogen Respectively?”, “Chemical Warfare in Ancient India”, “The Scientific Basis of the Ancient Hindu Conception of Cosmogony”, “The Egyptians and Their Possible Relation to Sanskrit Devnagari Characters”, and “Practice of Pharmacy in Ancient India”.\n\nUnfortunately, except for “Chemical Warfare in Ancient India,” I have not been able to access other papers.\n\nMy sole intention in putting together this blog is to provide references to Kokatnur’s revelations, in the hope that someone somewhere digs further and builds on them because the world is definitely missing out on some hidden, invaluable knowledge. We cannot write off Kokatnur’s works as the zealous findings of a man romanticizing his roots; rather, he was a man of science and based his works on solid evidence.\n\nHe was respected across the world, and his biography published in “Encyclopedia of American Biography: New Series” speaks for itself.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Kokatnur was born in Kokatnur, Athani, and after a BSc from Bombay University (1912) he moved to the US, graduating MS from the University of Minnesota in 1914. He received a Shevlin fellowship during this period.\n\nHe became an American citizen in 1921 and lived in New York. He was also a member of a major scientific group in America and was on the Advisory Board of the Watumull Foundation.\n\nIn the 74th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Detroit, Michigan from September 5-10, 1927, Dr. Kokatnur read two important papers which had evidence to prove that Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley were not the first men to discover hydrogen and oxygen, but that these gases had been known to the Indian sages, and then he read a second paper to show that chemistry was of Aryan and not Semitic origin.\n\n“The Minnesota Alumni Weekly: July, 1927 – October 15, 1927. Vol. 27 No. 1 – No. 4”, wrote at length about its alumnus Vaman R Kokatnur and his findings. Here is an excerpt:\n\n“While working on his study of hieroglyphics, he came across a Sanskrit book which contained four pages of an old but well-known manuscript which was written in 1350 and contains the collected writings of Agastya. These few pages were discovered by Vase in the library of an Indian prince, in 1924, in Ujjain, India.\n\nAgastya is a sage whose name has been mentioned in Indian writings as far back as 2000 B.C. Consequently, this manuscript, which is known as “Agastya-Samhita” if authentic, is extremely old as far as source material is concerned, belonging to post-Vedic and pre-epic times.\n\nBeing a chemist, Dr. Kokatnur naturally seized this manuscript with avidity for the sage Agastya is credited with being the discoverer of hydrogen and oxygen, the dry electric battery, electro-plating, kites, hot-air blimps and propelled balloons. In fact, he is named variously after his discoveries, in contrast with the present practice naming the discoveries after one’s name. Thus he is called “pot-born” (dry electric battery); “cathode-anode” (electricity); “conquerer of kites and blimps”, and so forth. It is as if we should call Henry Ford, “Flivver”, and Mr Edison “incandescent lamps”, “movie” or “Dictaphone”.\n\nChemists at the convention gasped when Dr. Kokatnur read to them the following translation of the method of making a dry electric battery which was written centuries before the Christian era:\n\nA well-cleaned copper plate should be placed in an earthen-ware vessel. It should then be covered first by moist sawdust. Mercury amalgamated zinc plate should then be placed on the top of the saw-dust. By their contact a light known by the twin-names Mitra-Varuna (cathode-anode or electricity) is produced. The water is split up by this into gases, Vital and Up-faced. The joining together of hundred such vessels is very active or effective.”\n\nFrom his knowledge of Chemistry, Dr. Kokatnur recognized that this was the method used in making a dry battery, but did not know what part the mercury amalgamated zinc plate had in the reaction until he consulted a battery maker who explained that it prevented polarization.”\n\nThis is the shloka from Agastya Samhita talking of process – (संस्थाप्य मृण्मये पात्रे ताम्रपत्रं सुसंस्कृतम्‌। छादयेच्छिखिग्रीवेन चार्दाभि: काष्ठापांसुभि:॥ दस्तालोष्टो निधात्वय: पारदाच्छादितस्तत:। संयोगाज्जायते तेजो मित्रावरुणसंज्ञितम्‌॥ source: Aabhas24)\n\nThe Science News, Washington, reported, “The word chemistry and the names of such chemical materials as toilet articles, perfumes, dyes, textile fibers, precious stones and metals have been traced back to an Aryan source by Dr. W. R. Kokatnur, consulting chemist of New York City.\n\nHe cited hieroglyphic records as well as archeological and ethnological evidence to support his conclusions concerning the origin of chemical terms.”\n\nIn a reprint of an article from the Journal of Chemical Education, Vol. 25, page 286, May 1948 titled “Chemical Warfare in Ancient India”, Kokatnur examined the ancient Indian literature and claimed that the ancients must have had amazing knowledge based on his interpretation of various arms mentioned in translations of the Ramayan and Mahabharat. (Read it here)\n\nThe Minnesota Weekly had mentioned that his work was to be published in the science history journal Isis. But according to Wikipedia, “possibly due to the doubtful provenance of sources and the rather vague interpretations, his work was not published.“\n\nConsidering that Kokatnur had established himself as a prominent inventor, it was a pity that his works did not get the credibility, they deserved.\n\nI tried to include links to the paper presented by Kokatnur during the 74th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Detroit, but could not find it online.\n\nHere are a few newspaper clippings to demonstrate that Kokatnur had established himself as a prominent inventor. His works prove that ancient India was far ahead of its time and that its scriptures and texts are not just literary or spiritual in nature but a gift for the scientific advancement of the entire human race.\n\nReferences – http://www.manchesterhistory.org/News/Manchester%20Evening%20Hearld_1939-09-16.pdf\n\nCourtesy: Google\n\nWho can forget the magnetism of Jay Gatsby as he woos Daisy in the 1920s – the post-World War I years, when people were drawn to excesses? Overflowing champagnes, Rolls Royces, alluring beauties, wealth accumulated through fraudulent means, indulgences, and people living in an illusional make-belief world of opulence and extravagance. After a century later, are we back to the age of excesses, albeit in a virtual society?\n\nJust as high-class tea party invites and grand dinner party invitations were alluring for New York party-goers dying to catch a glimpse of Gatsby’s extravagant life in his mansion. Similarly, alerts and notifications from our devices compel us to enter the glamorous virtual world when we should be talking to our children or paying attention to something in the real world.\n\nGatsby projected a fake persona to dominate the party scene and win over Daisy. Similarly. Aren’t we all a little superficial online, in our carefully crafted personas? And don’t we all get smitten or insecure when others appear to look or do better than us. Social media and networking apps feed on insecurity and competitiveness, to pull us into a rat race where self-worth increases or decreases with every like or comment. Must we need this kind of pat-on-the-back every time?\n\nGatsby seemingly had many top-class ‘connections’ but none of them turned out to be his real friends. Are the people in our network real ‘friends’ or just connections? Do we know them at a deeper level? Should those ‘connections’ take precedence over our children, family, and close friends?\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, the narrator Nick Carraway (incidentally from Minnesota) observes the ever-changing social lives of people around him. It is similar to what we see as the status updates of our acquaintances. People absent from the party scenes were considered ‘common’ then! And now, we feel that the absentees from Facebook or Instagram must be leading such a ‘non-happening’ life. Online presence has become a must for everyone.\n\nAgreed, we need our devices in the digital world – for our jobs, shopping, and to connect. We might miss important news and updates if we go to the other extreme of digital Samyasa. But shouldn’t we be calling the shots? How will our compulsive habit of reaching for the phone every few minutes end? How do we take the balanced approach when the virtual societal construct targets the human psyche and makes us play along (‘The Social Dilemma’ on Netflix was an eye-opener).\n\nThe virtual world is overshadowing our real-life and making it look so barren and stark? Where would our endless rush for virtual dopamine take us? Our attention span is decreasing and we are overwhelming our senses. But how are we going to stop? I often tell myself – ” I am simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of digital life.”\n\nI believe the age of excesses won’t last long. It never did in the past. The great depression of 1929 brought the opulence of the 20s to a crashing end. Maybe ours will too. But would there be substantial damage done by then? Will humans become more superficial, insecure, extremist, and preoccupied? Will our kids know the difference between virtual and real?\n\nThere is a reason why author F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby feels so relevant in today’s world where we have reached a new level of comfort and convenience. It presents human follies and the hopelessness of societal constructs. Gatsby knew he led a flashy and hollow life, but he created it for his love – Daisy. We know it too, but unlike Gatsby, we don’t know why are we nosediving into the hollowness of virtual reality?\n\nHow do we get disengaged and disentangled? – This, my dear reader, is a million-dollar question!\n\nHere is a very imaginative bedtime folk story to spark your kids’ imagination!\n\nOnce upon a time, the Sky was very close to the Earth. You see, they were married! They were so close that humans could actually touch the clouds in the Sky.\n\nSince there was little space between the Earth and the Sky, humans were smaller in size. They were so little, that they used rats to plow the field instead of oxen. And they kept ants as pets.\n\nSometimes life would become inconvenient for men and women. If they jumped, their heads bumped into the clouds, causing rain. They could not even lift their hands while dancing. The trees could not grow big because there was no room to grow. And the Sun was too close, causing extreme hot weather.\n\nAlthough, some kids loved having the Sky so close at night. You see, they could check out the stars closely! But on moonlit nights, it was difficult to sleep since the Moon glowed so much that all of them had to cover their eyes.\n\nOne day, a very old, grumpy granny was sweeping her courtyard with a broom. Accidentally her hand hit against the Sky. This made her lose her temper. Angrily, she gave the Sky a very hard push.\n\nThe Sky was already scared of the granny’s temper. And it went up like a rocket, and reached where it is today to be safe.\n\nThe Earth began to weep since her husband had gone far from her. But the Sky said they could always meet when the rain would fall! They would also be together, somewhere in the horizon. He was not ready to come down because of the angry granny.\n\nSo, the Sky stayed up and the Earth down. Also, this was convenient, since there was more room for everyone to grow taller. The grumpy granny lived longer than two hundred years and came to be known as – The angry granny who pushed away the sky.\n\n-Inspired by a folk story of Muria Tribe from Madhya Pradesh, India\n\nGraphics – @storiesbyshivangi\n\nUnder a leafless apple tree, sat a little girl named Shrivi. She wore loose, worn-out clothes and torn footwear that barely had soles on them. Her small bare hands looked frost-bitten and she tucked them often under her armpits. Her face looked red and her eyes had a vacant stare as she took in her snow-filled surrounding.\n\nHer stomach growled and she realized she had not eaten since the past two days except a half leftover chapati. For the thousandth time, she wished her father returned from the town where he had gone to sell carpets. He had promised to return within a month with money, food, and clothes. But he didn’t, and they were starving. Her mother was sick, they had no food and perhaps, her father was in trouble.\n\nA tear trickled down her cheek as she remembered her resolve to pick twigs and buy food early that morning. They needed food and oil in their lamp as it was frightening to stay in the dark every night. But unfortunately, it was afternoon and she hadn’t found twigs because of a sudden snowstorm.\n\nThe world looked dark and hopeless.\n\nA gentle tap on the shoulders aroused her from reverie. A tall middle-aged man in a flowing brown beard stood there holding the reins of a handsome brown stallion. What did he want?\n\n“Hello,” he said gently. “Will you please help me?” he asked. Shrivi looked at him with strange eyes. How could she help someone when she herself needed help?\n\n“My horse needs water and rest. Where is your home? Can I stay there for a while? I have a long journey to go and I will leave as soon as the biggest and brightest star in the sky will be visible,” he said politely.\n\nShrivi reluctantly got up and asked him to follow her. While walking, Shrivi felt bad. She didn’t want the guest to see her poverty and her poor, sick mother but it would be rude to deny help. She was also ashamed that she had no food to offer to the stranger according to the village tradition. In there village, any traveler looking for help, was welcomed as God himself.\n\n“Tell me, little girl, what are you grateful for?” asked the stranger, all of a sudden, while walking towards her hut.\n\n“How can I be grateful; when I have nothing?” said the girl.\n\n“Well, it’s a game I play with children – The Gratitude Game. Come on, make an effort, just find any reason… even a bad reason to be grateful would be wonderful,” he said.\n\nShrivi thought for a moment and said, “Well, I am grateful for my legs as I can walk…”\n\n“That’s great, isn’t it?” he said.\n\nThe stranger coaxed her on and little by little, she found many other reasons to be grateful for on her way back home – her eyes, arms, her mother, the tree by her hut, her pet hare, mother Earth, the sky…\n\nLo and behold… she didn’t know how, but by the time she reached her hut, it felt like Summertime. Everything looked magical. The tree and the ground by her house were filled with berries while the sun shone brightly.\n\nFilling her mouth with berries and offering some to the stranger, she laughed and asked – “What miracle did you do?”\n\n“I didn’t do anything. You did it!” said the strange stranger.\n\nShe picked up berries for her mother too and invited the guest inside the hut.\n\nWhen they entered the dilapidated hut, Shrivi’s frail sick mother was startled. “Mother, I have brought a special guest. You know he is a miracle man. He and his horse need rest till the evening. He is on his way to meet the holy ‘King of Kings’, being led by the biggest star in the sky.”\n\nShrivi’s mother hid her anxious emotions and mustered energies to get up and welcome the guest. He looked so grand, dignified, and resplendent while she felt ashamed of her poverty and the humble hut. What would she offer him? She was relieved to see that Shrivi had picked up plenty of berries.\n\nBut the guest looked perfectly at home as he rested on the mat which she spread on the floor. Crushing the berries, she made juice for herself and their guest while Shrivi went outside to give water to his horse.\n\n“Thank you for helping me out. In return for your hospitality, I would like to give you something,” said the stranger after a while.\n\n“You are welcome, Sir. But we do not take gifts from our guests. Thank you for the offering.” the lady said politely.\n\n“Well, it’s not riches or money. But just a lesson. Will you accept it?” The lady nodded reluctantly.\n\n“Well, first tell me one thing – What are you grateful for?” he asked.\n\n“There is nothing to be grateful for,” the lady said, shocked almost angry. She felt it was impolite to ask a poor woman to be grateful when she was suffering so much.\n\n“Believe me, any small thing to be grateful about would work to begin your lesson.” the guest insisted.\n\nThe lady thought and thought. But only her trouble, sorrow, and poverty came into her mind. What could she be grateful for when everything looked so dark. Everyone in the whole world was better off than them. What had happened to her husband? Why was God so cruel to them? And then the image of a little girl came into her mind and her perception shifted. “I am grateful for Shrivi,” she whispered.\n\nThe wise man coaxed on and the lady found several other little things to be grateful about – the hut, her neighbors, the berries… While talking about those little things, she smiled. This caused a ripple effect in the universe – her universe. She realized, she was feeling quite good and her fever was gone. She felt energetic enough to begin work on an old carpet.\n\n“What miracle did you do?” she asked. “I didn’t do anything. You did it,” he smiled.\n\nWhen the biggest star was visible in the sky that evening, the magical guest took leave to continue his journey towards the ‘holy infant’. “Thank you for helping me. I bless you both with the gift of the highest and noblest of all emotions – the feeling of gratitude. That emotion is the very fountain of fulfillment and joy,” the wise man said before leaving.\n\nThere was something about that wise man’s lesson that changed the lives of Shrivi and her mother. Every day, they began to follow that simple method of gratitude and things began to look good. Her mother found work with a decent income, and some sheep, within a few days their living conditions became better.\n\nAnd on one glorious night, when a luminous baby was born on a different side of the Earth, someone came knocking at their hut.\n\nAt last, Shrivi’s father had returned with riches, food, and clothes. It was a joyous reunion for the family. That night, as they shared their respective experiences and adventures, one particular story stood out – Shrivi’s story of the magical guest, who was following the biggest star in the sky.\n\n(I hope you liked this gift.
