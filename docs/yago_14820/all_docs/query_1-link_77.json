        "text": "William Shatner, born on March 22, 1931 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, is an iconic figure in the entertainment industry. His journey into stardom began when he enrolled at McGill University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. However, it was his intense passion for acting that led him to abandon his business pursuits and instead join the Canadian National Repertory Theatre in Ottawa. Shatner's breakthrough came with his role as Captain James T. Kirk in the revolutionary science fiction television series Star Trek (1966-1969). The show catapulted Shatner into global fame, and his portrayal of the fearless leader of the Starship Enterprise has since become a symbol of the genre. Following the conclusion of the original series, Shatner reprised his role in seven Star Trek feature films and various spin-offs, further cementing his legacy in the Star Trek universe. Beyond Star Trek, Shatner has showcased his versatility across various mediums. He starred in the successful television series T.J. Hooker and won two Emmy Awards for his role in Boston Legal. He also ventured into literature, authoring numerous Star Trek novels, while his memoirs provide an insightful look into his illustrious career and personal life. Shatner's contribution to the entertainment industry stretches over six decades, a testament to his enduring appeal and talent. His career is marked by his ability to reinvent himself, continually captivating audiences with his charm, wit, and distinctive style.\n\nRufus McGarrigle Wainwright (born July 22, 1973) is an American-Canadian singer, songwriter, and composer. He has recorded seven albums of original music and numerous tracks on compilations and film soundtracks. He has also written a classical opera and set Shakespeare sonnets to music for a theater piece by Robert Wilson. Wainwright's self-titled debut album was released through DreamWorks Records in May 1998. His second album, Poses, was released in June 2001. Wainwright's third and fourth studio albums, Want One (2003) and Want Two (2004), were repackaged as the double album Want in 2005. In 2007, Wainwright released his fifth studio album Release the Stars and his first live album Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall. His second live album Milwaukee at Last!!! was released in 2009, followed by the studio albums All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu (2010) and Out of the Game (2012). The double album Prima Donna (2015), was a recording of his opera of the same name. His ninth studio album Take All My Loves: 9 Shakespeare Sonnets (2016), featured nine adaptions of Shakespeare's sonnets. Wainwright is the son of musicians Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, and the older brother of singer Martha Wainwright.\n\nCharles Richard Drew (June 3, 1904 â€“ April 1, 1950) was an American surgeon and medical researcher. He researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II. This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces. As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned his position with the American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950."
