        "text": "March 13, 2019\n\nDragons!!!\n\nNory and her Upside-Down Magic class are going on a three day class trip to Dragon Haven, where injured dragons are taken care of. Unfortunately Pepper can‚Äôt attend because her fiercing magic would scare all of the dragons but the rest of Nory‚Äôs class are ready for this adventure, including their teacher, Ms. Starr, and the school nurse, Nurse Riley (whose first name we find out in this book - Felix!).\n\nI enjoyed getting to know Andres better in this book. In the first three books of the series he‚Äôs primarily only been the boy on a leash who floats at the top of the UDM classroom because his upside down flying magic doesn‚Äôt allow him to do anything but stay airborne. It was lovely to see him interacting with other flyers and given the opportunity to let loose for a while and learn more about his ability.\n\nMs. Starr is still my favourite character. I wish I had been able to see her magic in action with the dragons. She‚Äôs such a sweetheart; so lovely and supportive and I want a teacher just like her.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre letting yourself shine,‚Äù she told him, ‚Äúand it makes me happy.‚Äù\n\nAlthough she does make some mistakes in this book she quickly owns up to them and apologises.\n\nI loved getting a glimpse of the different types of dragons being cared for at Dragon Haven and it was fun seeing Nory identify what type of dragon she becomes when she‚Äôs a dritten (part dragon, part kitten). I hope Nory returns to Dragon Haven in a future book to visit Roarie. I definitely didn‚Äôt like it when Nory took the baby dragon when it hatched after she‚Äôd been specifically told that it would imprint on the first face it saw and how bad that would be if it didn‚Äôt imprint on another dragon. The fact that she didn‚Äôt have any consequences for doing this and making all of the staff worry about this missing baby dragon overnight really disappointed me. While it was nice for the story that when she gave up the baby dragon for another dragon to care for the fact that the baby essentially didn‚Äôt even give her a second glance as it left negated the whole concept of imprinting for me.\n\nOf all of the wonderful dragons described in this book my favourites were the luminous dragonettes. I need an entire rainbow of luminous dragonettes! They‚Äôre the smallest species of dragon and they light up like fireflies!\n\nWhile there was bacon in this book the food I craved the most while reading was Nory‚Äôs waffle sandwich with hot fudge, whipped cream and hot caramel sauce. ü§§\n\nI love that while each of the books in this series focuses on Nory as the main character there‚Äôs also a spotlight put on at least one of her UDM classmates. I‚Äôm really looking forward to learning more about Willa, who has the ability to make it rain indoors, in the next book.\n\nSeptember 27, 2019\n\nI loved this book I can't wait to read the next one.\n\nAugust 15, 2020\n\nThis book might be my favorite in the series so far (I feel like I kinda say that with every book though but maybe they just keep getting better and better :) ). I loved Andres as a co-POV-character and I really hope we somehow get more from him. I really liked all the different dragons in this story and how they are kinda treated like any other rare species in the world, I do hope we get to come back to the sanctuary sometime or even just hear more about dragons (or some other magical creatures throughout the story) throughout the story since its such a fun little magical element.\n\nI really liked how both Nory and Andres's stories went in this book, and how everyone from both schools sort of reacted to each other (and that for a change there was no bullying in this book). I'm so excited to get to the next books (although as always I'm generally just saving these audiobooks for rainy days because they are excellent pick me ups\n\nAugust 16, 2020\n\n4.5üåü\n\nThis series is just really, really wonderful! I felt that Dragon Overnight went a little bit deeper emotionally than the previous installments, and I particularly loved the expansion of the world as well as all of the different character dynamics.\n\nNovember 4, 2018\n\nSuper cute! I loved seeing them outside of UDM & interacting with Sage.\n\nJanuary 19, 2019\n\nThis might be the best book in the Upside Down Magic series, but they all blur together a bit so I can't say this definitively. I remember that Ms. Starr's upside down-ness was revealed a book or two back, but I can't, for the life of me, remember what it was. I can't remember what Marigold's upside down trait is, or what was the name of the girl who only shows up at the beginning of this book because she's a reverse Fuzzy is, but that's okay. These books are quite enjoyable, but if I met a group of real children once every six months, I'd be hard pressed to remember all their names and food allergies too. But Andres always sticks out. The other UDM kids have quirky fun magic, like ice powers and drittening, but Andres is always one leash fail away from a slow, terrible death. He's always left out, as well. The other kids all run around having fun together, and Andres is floating above everyone asking them to repeat what they just said. Dragon Overnight starts out that way. One of the kids is having a meltdown on the bus, Ms. Starr omits a headcount, and Andres is left floating outside for thankfully less than the whole trip to dragon camp, but long enough that his position in life is made clear to him. Meanwhile, Nory is Nory. She's excited about dragon camp, and she gets involved in a game of kittenball but uses her extra fluxing powers to tilt the game. How is that legal? She's playing with kids from the other school that's having an educational, elementary school camp experience that weekend, the kids from Sage Academy, the school where Nory's useless dad is headmaster. Meanwhile, Andres is forgotten on the ceiling of the Great Hall, which turns out to be worthwhile because he can have a well-deserved pity party, not hang out with his friends who ditched him, and take advantage of his floating powers all at the same time. Andres is swooshing and bouncing around the ceiling when a group of Sage Academy Flyers walk in and see Andres as a Flyer par excellence and not a wonky kid on a leash. These are Andres' new camp friends, and he deserves them. I mean this sincerely. Then everyone does various nature center/dragon camp activities and mingles and has a time that is fun, educational, and modestly cathartic. Basically like a real elementary school class trip, except when my fifth grade class went to the Courage Center, our time was too well managed to let us experience and overcome any personal crises, and that's a good thing. In the end, Nory has a good talk with her dad, who's still useless, and Andres learns to work his flying skills so that he's pretty much a superhero now.\n\nSide note: I always enjoy how all the adults in this universe have a diversity of real jobs, instead of like in the Potter 'verse where everyone is either a wannabe tyrant or a civil servant.\n\nFebruary 27, 2020\n\nÿß€åŸÜ ⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ™Ÿàÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß Ÿà Ÿæÿß€åŸÜ ŸÖ€å ÿ®ÿ±ÿØ\n\nÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ⁄©Ÿá ÿßÿ™ŸÅÿßŸÇ ÿÆŸàÿ¥ ÿ¢€åŸÜÿØ€å ŸÖ€å ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿßÿØ ÿ¢ŸÜŸÇÿØÿ± ⁄©Ÿá ÿ¨ÿ∞ÿßÿ® ÿ®ŸàÿØ ŸÖ€å ÿÆŸàÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖ ÿßÿ≤ ÿÆŸàÿ¥ÿ≠ÿßŸÑ€å ŸÅÿ±€åÿßÿØ ÿ®ÿ≤ŸÜŸÖ\n\n€åÿß ÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ⁄©Ÿá ÿßÿ™ŸÅÿßŸÇ ÿ®ÿØ€å ŸÖ€å ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿßÿØ ŸÖ€å ÿÆŸàÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÖ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿØŸÅÿπŸá ÿßÿ≤ ŸÜÿßÿ±ÿßÿ≠ÿ™€å ŸÅÿ±€åÿßÿØ ÿ®ÿ≤ŸÜŸÖ\n\n€å⁄© ÿ≠ŸÇ€åŸÇÿ™ ÿ¨ÿßŸÑÿ®\n\nÿ™Ÿà€å Ÿáÿ± €å⁄© ÿßÿ≤ ÿ¨ŸÑÿØ Ÿáÿß €å⁄©€å ÿØÿ± ŸÖ€åÿßŸÜ ÿØÿ± ÿ®ÿßÿ±Ÿá €å ŸÜÿ±€å Ÿà €å⁄©€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ ÿ¢ŸÖŸàÿ≤ÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ Ÿà ÿµÿ≠ÿ®ÿ™ ŸÖ€å ⁄©ŸÜÿØ\n\nÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ\n\nÿ™Ÿà€å ŸÇÿ≥ŸÖÿ™ ÿßŸàŸÑ ŸÜÿ±€å Ÿà ÿßŸÑ€åŸàÿ™\n\nÿØŸàŸÖ ŸÜÿ±€å Ÿà ÿ®⁄©ÿ≥\n\nÿ≥ŸàŸÖ ŸÜÿ±€å Ÿà ŸæŸæÿ±\n\n⁄ÜŸáÿßÿ±ŸÖ ŸÜÿ±€å Ÿà ÿ¢ŸÜÿØÿ±ÿ≥\n\n⁄©ÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ≥ÿ®⁄©€å ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ Ÿà ÿß⁄Øÿ± ŸàŸÇÿ™ ÿ®⁄Øÿ∞ÿßÿ±€åÿØ ŸÖ€å ÿ™ŸàÿßŸÜ€åÿØ ÿØÿ± €å⁄© ÿ™ÿß ÿØŸà ÿ≥ÿßÿπÿ™ ÿ®ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ€åÿØ\n\nÿ≠ÿ™ŸÖÿß Ÿæ€åÿ¥ŸÜŸáÿßÿØ ŸÖ€å ⁄©ŸÜŸÖ ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüëçüèª\n\nAugust 20, 2018\n\nI probably say this everytime I read a new book in the series, but this is the best one so far. The UDM (upside down magic) kids have magic that doesn't work the same way as other children's magic does. Nory's class ends up on an overnight field trip at Dragon Haven with the grade five students from Sage Academy. Nory's father is there also.\n\nWhat I liked was how the students from this school appreciated the talents and skills of the UDM children. I also loved that Nory and her father seemed to come to a new kind of understanding.\n\nOctober 19, 2018\n\nI'm constantly impressed by this series. It tackles difficult topics without being preachy, cheesy or condescending. This one addressed coming to the understanding that a child and parent may not every be able to fully understand each other but can love each other anyway. Plus the storytelling is always good, fun to read aloud, and the ending made my daughter cry. This is a great series for young readers of this generation!\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nThis one was not nearly as good as the last one. Nothing happened and it was sort of boring. Also, predictable\n\nApril 19, 2019\n\nAndres, the boy whose Upside Down Magic of flying means he's always floating, makes some new friends when the magic academy students visit a dragon rescue.\n\nThis book is cute, just like the rest of the series. I'm way above the age range of the key audience (way, way above), but they're still enjoyable as an adult read. The kids react realistically and the magic is fun. And dragons! I listened to this as an audio book which I seldom do because I struggle with them. I think I've found the trick - listening to kids' books in this format might work for me. I'll definitely be reading (or listening to) the next book in the series.\n\nJanuary 22, 2023\n\nThis is a very good book. It has the characters from the previous books in the series and some new people. The UDM class from Dunwiddle goes on a field trip to Dragon Haven. A place where injured dragons go. The kids have a bunch of fun adventures and some issues along the way. Nori reunites with her father.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 25, 2020\n\nLots of good friend and family issues and lessons in here. And dragons!! Lots of dragons! Recommended for grades 2 & up. Best to read the series in order.\n\nMay 15, 2020\n\nMy third grade students liked this one. Good for that age.\n\nMarch 30, 2018\n\nThis is a fun read, and I think kids will enjoy it for the silliness and dragons. I appreciate that it showed that kids can be different and not torment each other over it. And that while you may be envious of one set of kids, they might be looking at you the same way. Like Nory's realization that the Sage students were embarrassed to be \"boring\" for not wearing pajamas to breakfast.\n\nI haven't read the other books in the series, so take what I say with a grain of salt...But I don't quite understand why there are 5 traditional paths of magic, and your magic is \"upside down\" if it doesn't conform exactly to one of those. Like...someone who can ice things shouldn't be an \"upside down\" Flare, he should be an Icer or something. Or there should be a different name for the entire category of being able to affect the elements. Anyone who can change shape should be a Flux, if you can fly, you're a Flyer. Normally you have broad categories, then a narrower sub-sect, but this is the opposite.\n\nI find it weird that Nory fluxes into animals she's never seen (like the Blurper). If Andres can fly, why on earth can he only fly UP? That's more like floating.\n\nThe adults in the book are amazingly irresponsible. There's Nory's dad, who sucks (I don't find it believable that he was fine when her mom was alive, then turned into this cold fish). But Nory's teachers...! They leave the floating kid outside the bus (Ms. Starr didn't notice that she couldn't move anywhere with the leash out the door?), they leave the backpack of bricks, the nurse ties Andres to a chair so he can check out an exhibit, then FORGETS about him...really, Andres gets the worst of everything. But also no one can hear anyone else if they are distracted or moving, since not only did no one respond to his shouts, but Nory couldn't get anyone's attention when the Blurper was hatching. Which..why did it matter if a Blurper imprinted on a human? It was apparently able to transfer it's attachment to another dragon immediately. It was pretty annoying that Nory even swiped the baby to begin with, knowing she could be damaging it irreparably just because she thought it was cute.\n\nApril 10, 2018\n\nI loved Dragon Haven, and I am SO not a dragon book person, but this installment of the Upside-Down Magic series was my favorite in awhile!\n\nAnd the whole element of Nory trying to impress her father for the first time, so darn sweet. This one was for the heart-strings for sure.\n\nJuly 11, 2021\n\nThis series continues to be so fun to read aloud! All three of my kids (9, 8, and 6...and sometimes even the 4 year old) ask for another chapter every night!\n\nI love the character development of Nory and how each book has been focus on a specific student in the UDM class as well: book 1: Elliott , book 2: Bax, book 3: Pepper and this book 4: Andres!\n\nI once again got a lump in my throat near the end when it was all coming together. I really like seeing the relationship between Nory and her father grow in this one.\n\nPlus DRAGONS! I think we all would love a branch off series that is JUST about Dragon Haven üêâüíú\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\nAdorable. I want to go to this school and then üêâ camp. I love how welcoming it is and seriously, baby dragons? üòç\n\nApril 4, 2018\n\nThe 10 year old is smitten with this series.\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nWe love listening to this series as a family. We have kids ranging in age from almost 13 all the way down to 5 and they all like these books. They were all so excited that there was a new Upside down magic book out. My husband and I also enjoy listening to these books. As a parent with a child with special needs, I love that the books are about embracing your differences and learning to love and accept who you are and that everyone has value even when you are different from other people. The books are fun, the characters are engaging, it is well written, and in this case the audio books are well read.\n\nJanuary 15, 2020\n\nThis review is written by Clio (age 6) and may contain spoilers. (Audiobook)\n\nThis is about Nory and Andres They go on this field trip with their school to a wild dragon center. They observe dragons there. These are dragons that were orphaned or found hurt. Then Nori discovers that her father and her school that she was previously at were there. They didn't want to see each other, but they did, when he came into the room she had a great idea. She said, everybody is bummed about not seeing the dragon, but you can still make them see it, you can make the walls invisible so you can see them.\n\nMarch 28, 2018\n\nA fun-filled series that resounds with everyone who approaches life from a different perspective.\n\nI aspire to be a senior-citizen dritten. Eagerly awaiting the next installment.\n\nFebruary 8, 2024\n\nKiddo and I loved this one as well. This series is just perfection overall. We loved the school camping trip setting for the story. The dragons were super cool as well. Nory and her dad get to clear the air between them a bit, which was nice. They still have their differences, but they seem to understand and accept one another more now. Roarie was super cute. It was nice hearing from Andres' perspective too, and really nice how the kids all made friends with Sage Academy students and they admired their upside-down magic and found it cool rather than looking down on them for it.\n\nDecember 7, 2019\n\nThis book is/was awesome! (Not to mention this is my third time reading it. üòä) I loved this book and I hope you will to. ;)\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nI absolutely loved everything about this book! I love how the Author describes everything the characters do, think, and say. I also love how the Author describes how they all feel. This is a very good book series for all of those who have not read it yet! One of my favorite parts of this book in particular, was how Andres feels being above everyone else, and how he felt when he met the Sage Academy Flyers. Another thing I enjoyed reading, was how Nory‚Äôs emotion was described on the bus to Dragon Heaven, which escalated when she stole Roarie. This is a great book series for those who love magic, fantasy, etc, etc.\n\nIn this book Nory, Elliott, Sebastian, Willa, Marigold, Bax, Mrs. Starr, Nurse Riley (name revealed in book- Felix), and Andres all take a field-trip to Dragon Haven. Andres, who has only ever had a perspective from above since he turned 10, meets the Sage Academy Flyers, who admire his ability to fly so high up. The day Andres met them, he had felt more important and wanted, which was enjoyable to experience from him.\n\nI really enjoyed his perspective on everything, and getting to know him better.\n\nNory also had a similar experience, except for the fact that she had enjoyed going from the start, other than being upset that Pepper, her Feircing friend couldn‚Äôt attend the trip because of her ability to terrify animals into hiding.\n\nThe experience Nory has with Roarie was one of my favorite things about the book. As Nory, Elliott, and the rest of their friends (except Andres, who was going out flying with his new flying friends), to see an egg incubator. Even though the person leading them through told them to get away from any hatching eggs, Nory stays as one slowly pops open. According to Nory: She had never been filled with so much love. She kept the small dragonet (whelp) inside of her hoodie, in which she stuffed hotdogs and other foods.\n\nWhile all of the campers were surrounding the campfire, (or, as they were puting it out) Elliott uses his freezing magic to extinguish the flames.\n\nThis is where my favorite quote of the book takes place: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre letting yourself shine,‚Äù she said to him. ‚ÄúAnd it makes me happy.‚Äù\n\nI won‚Äôt spoil anything else from here! If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, go ahead! Again, I love this series, and I can only hope that you do too! The only recommendations I have for other future books are that Nory meets Roarie again, Andres has another book to share his life story, and that Elliott and Nory can break through to the Sparkies at some point. (If any of these things do happen in other books I haven‚Äôt read yet, please make sure not to spoil too much!)\n\nNovember 5, 2018\n\nSo far in the series, this would have to be my least favourite book. Of course, I'm reading it through adult eyes when it's clearly meant for a younger audience, but I just found the underlying morals of the story were so bad.\n\nThis may be a little spoiler-ish, so stop reading here if you haven't read it and don't want my opinion of some storylines. Since you're still reading, my main problem is Nory - the main character - who we are supposed to love and respect because she stands up for herself and is proud to be different has now decided to purposely break rules, lie, sneak, and put a live creature at risk. The worst part? The adults just brush it off when they all find out, like \"oh, okay, well don't do that again and thanks for getting caught (because she did NOT come forward on her own account)\". That's horrible! What a dumb message for kids. While reading this aloud to my daughter, I felt like I had to keep stopping and explaining why what she was doing was wrong - just to make sure my daughter doesn't try something equally stupid.\n\nThen there's the matter of the dad. Nory understands that her dad is, basically, a dink. He's a horrible father and now he's showing himself to be a strict and boring headmaster/teacher. When the other kids all joke about him, Nory stands up for him. Now, I get the whole \"he's my dad\", but she was SO defensive - I want to think that that is a good quality to have, but how many times will she have to defend him. I much would have preferred to see something along the lines of her NOT saying anything, her dad realizing she didn't even defend him, and maybe growing up himself a little bit as a result.\n\nAnyways, long story short: quite disappointed in this book. Hopefully the next one gets better, or I may have to convince my daughter that we need better reading material.\n\nNovember 21, 2018\n\n{My thoughts} ‚Äì Nory and her class from Dunwiddle Magic School get to go on a trip to the Dragon Haven. She and her classmates are extremely excited about this trip because they get to go overnight and see and interact with real dragons. This is a really really big deal for her class. Only one of her classmates isn‚Äôt able to go because her magic might cause more harm then good.\n\nWhen Nory and her classmates get there they learn that they are one of two student groups that are going to be attending this retreat. Nory gets a bit anxious because she‚Äôs afraid the other group of students won‚Äôt like her and her class because their magic isn‚Äôt cookie cutter. Nory ends up going for a walk with her friend Elliot and they see a Kittenball game going on. She ends up joining the game and learns that one of the other girls is a kitten that can breathe fire. She quickly learns that girl has two talents and that she canÔøΩÔøΩt always control it, like Nory and her classmates.\n\nWhen they go back for lunch Nory learns that the other group of students there is from Sage Academy. That is the school where her father is the headmaster. She ends up being thrust at her father by her new friend and they have an awkward conversation, but he does admit that she‚Äôs his daughter at least. The rest of the book is her working out her differences with her magic and her father for the most part.\n\nIt also revolves around Andre‚Äôs story and how he finally starts to better understand his magic. This is a huge thing, because up until that point he had no control over how high he‚Äôd float up in the air, because he had no idea how to get back down!\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to learn more about both of these situations, I highly recommend reading the book. It was fantastic and a wonderful addition to the series!"
