A siren.\n\nThe police were outside my house. Ready to arrest me for underage partying, excessive flirting, and an overcrowded hot tub.\n\nBut wait.\n\nMy brain turned on. No, not the cops. Just my phone—my dad’s ringtone.\n\nWhich was even worse.\n\nI rummaged around the futon. No phone. Instead I felt a leg. A guy’s leg. A guy’s leg flung over my ankle. A guy’s leg that did not belong to my boyfriend.\n\nOh God. Oh God. What did I do?\n\nWEEEooooWEEEooooWEEEoooo!\n\nUpstairs. The siren ring was coming from upstairs, the main level of Vi’s house.\n\nMaybe I should just go back to sleep . . . No! Phone ringing. In bed with not my boyfriend. I managed to get myself out of the futon without disturbing him and—um, where were my pants? Why was I in bed with a guy who was not my boyfriend without any pants?\n\nAt least I had underwear on. And a long-sleeved shirt. I looked around for some pants. The sole item of clothing within grabbing distance was Vi’s red dress that I wore last night for the party.\n\nThat dress was trouble.\n\nI ran up the stairs bare-legged. At the top, I almost passed out.\n\nIt looked like a war zone. Empty plastic cups littered the wooden floor. Half-eaten tortilla chips were planted in the shag area rug like pins on a bulletin board. A large blob—punch? Beer? Something I’d be better off not identifying?—had stained the bottom half of the pale blue curtain. A white lace bra hung from the four-foot cactus.\n\nBrett was in surfer shorts, face-planted on the couch. He was using the purple linen tablecloth as a blanket. Zachary was asleep in one of the dining room chairs, wearing an aluminum foil tiara on his lolled-back head. The patio door was open—and a puddle of rain had flooded the carpet.\n\nWEEEooooWEEEooooWEEEoooo! Phone was louder. Closer. But where? The kitchen counter? The kitchen counter! Nestled between a saucer of cigarette butts and an empty bottle of schnapps! I dove toward it. Hello?\n\nHappy birthday, Princess, my dad said. Did I wake you?\n\nWake me? I asked, my heart thumping. Of course not. It’s already—I spotted the microwave clock across the room—nine thirty-two.\n\nGood, because Penny and I are on our way to see you!\n\nTerror seized me. What does that mean?\n\nMy dad laughed. We decided to surprise you on your birthday. It was actually Penny’s idea.\n\nWait. For real?\n\nOf course for real! Surprise!\n\nMy head was spinning, and I felt like vomiting and it wasn’t just because of the many, many, definitely too many glasses of spiked punch I had consumed last night. My father could not see this place. No, no, no.\n\nOh God. I’d violated 110 percent of my dad’s rules. The evidence was all around, mocking me.\n\nThis wasn’t happening. It couldn’t happen. I would lose everything. If, after last night, I had anything left to lose. I took a step and a tortilla chip attacked my bare foot. Owww.\n\nMother friggin’ crap.\n\nThat’s great, Dad, I forced myself to say. So . . . where are you exactly? Did your plane just land?\n\nPlease let them still be at the airport. It would take them at least an hour to drive here from LaGuardia. I could make this house look presentable in an hour. I would find some pants. Then I would toss the bottles and cups and cigarette butts and vacuum the tortilla chips and maybe the bra, maybe even Brett and Zachary—\n\nNope, we just drove through Greenwich. We should be in Westport in twenty minutes.\n\nTwenty minutes?!\n\nThere was groaning from the couch. Brett flipped onto his back and said, It’s eff-ing freezing in here.\n\nApril, there’s not a boy over, is there? my dad asked.\n\nI sliced my hand through the air to tell Brett to shut the hell up.\n\nWhat? No! Of course not! Vi’s mom is listening to NPR.\n\nWe just passed the Rock Ridge Country Club. Looks like we’re making better time than I thought. We’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Can’t wait to see you, Princess.\n\nYou too, I choked out, and hung up. I closed my eyes. Then opened them.\n\nTwo half-naked boys in the great room. One in a tiara.\n\nMore half-naked boys in the bedrooms.\n\nEmpty liquor bottles and trashed cups.\n\nAnd Vi’s mom nowhere in sight.\n\nI was a dead princess.\n\nnumber one:\n\nlied to our parents\n\nTHREE MONTHS EARLIER\n\nHow would you like to finish high school in Cleveland? my dad asked me out of nowhere during Christmas break of junior year.\n\nFine. Maybe it wasn’t completely out of nowhere.\n\nTHREE MONTHS, ONE MINUTE, THIRTY SECONDS EARLIER\n\nApril, can you sit down? We need to talk to you about an important issue.\n\nThis should have tipped me off that something disconcerting was about to take place. But at the time, I was too busy multitasking to pick up on the signals. It was Thursday night, nine fifty-five, and Marissa had just dropped me off before my ridiculous ten o’clock (even during Christmas holidays) curfew. I was standing in front of the fridge debating between grapes or an apple for my evening snack and contemplating if tomorrow night was finally the right time to have sex with Noah.\n\nI was leaning toward the apple. Even though what I really wanted was chocolate fudge cake. But since Penny didn’t eat junk food, especially chocolate junk food, the likelihood of finding chocolate fudge cake in our fridge was about as high as finding a unicorn in our backyard.\n\nAs for the other thing . . . the one that made me want to jump on my bed and hide under the covers . . . it was time. I loved Noah. He loved me. We had waited long enough. We had planned on doing it over the break, but my brother, Matthew, had been here until this morning. Tonight, Noah had a party he had to go to with his parents and on Saturday he was leaving for Palm Beach.\n\nTomorrow was the only time. Plus, my dad and Penny had a dinner party in Hartford, an hour away, so that would leave me an empty house from about six to midnight. Sex would not take six hours. Would it?\n\nI guessed it would take thirty minutes, tops. Or an hour. Or three minutes.\n\nI was ready. Wasn’t I? I’d told Noah I was ready. I had convinced myself I was ready. Ready to have sex with Noah. Noah who had dimples when he smiled. Noah who’d been my boyfriend for over two years.\n\nI grabbed the apple, rinsed it, then took a large bite.\n\nBut was it a bad idea to do it the night before he left for a week in Palm Beach? What if I freaked out the next day and he was at the bottom of the country?\n\nYou’re dripping, my stepmom said, eyes darting back and forth between the offending fruit and the white-tiled floor. Pretty please, use a plate and sit down? Penny was obsessed with cleanliness. The way most people carried around a cell phone, Penny carried around hand-sanitizing wipes.\n\nI took a plate and a seat at the table, across from them. So what’s up?\n\nAnd a place mat, she added.\n\nThen came my father’s contribution: How would you like to finish high school in Cleveland?\n\nThe question did not sound like English. It made zero sense to me. I wasn’t going to Cleveland. I’d never been to Cleveland. Why would I be going to school there? Huh?\n\nMy dad and Penny stole quick glances at each other and then refocused on me. I’m starting a new job, he said.\n\nThe kitchen was suddenly a hundred degrees. But you already have a job, I explained slowly. He worked for a hedge fund right here in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nThis is a better job, he said. A very lucrative job. Very.\n\nBut—why do you need two jobs? In retrospect, I was being dense. But they were throwing massive information bombs at me. Cleveland! New job! Place mat!\n\n\"I don’t need two jobs, he said slowly. That’s why I’m quitting Torsto and taking the job at KLJ in Cleveland.\"\n\nMy brain was refusing to process this information. You’re moving to Cleveland?\n\n\"We’re moving to Cleveland,\" he said, sweeping his right hand to include all three of us. My dad, Penny. And me.\n\nI choked on a piece of apple.\n\nWhat? Me? In Cleveland? No. No, no, no. Not happening. I gripped the arms of my chair. I was not moving. They would not, could not, make me let go of this chair.\n\nWe’re all moving to Cleveland, Penny piped in. On January third.\n\nNine days. They wanted me to move in nine days? Wait. But. \"You asked me if I would like to finish high school in Cleveland. My answer is no. I would not.\"\n\nThey looked at each other again. April, Penny said. My folks have already found some terrific schools for you to . . .\n\nAs she rattled on, panic grabbed hold of my throat and tightened its grip. I wasn’t going to Cleveland. I wasn’t leaving my life. I wasn’t leaving Marissa. Or Vi. I wasn’t leaving Noah. I wasn’t leaving Westport smack in the middle of junior year. Not happening. No way. No thanks, I managed, my voice squeaky and weird.\n\nPenny giggled nervously and then added, We found a very nice house in . . .\n\nI took another bite of my apple and willed myself not to hear her. Lalalala.\n\nIf I didn’t leave Westport to move to Paris with Mom and Matthew, I wasn’t leaving to move to Cleveland with them. And why Cleveland? Penny’s parents were there so we had to be there too? Was it all about her? My head started to spin.\n\n. . . wonderful because you’re right in time for the new semester—\n\nI. Am. Not. Moving, I said with as much force as I could muster.\n\nThey stared at me again, obviously unsure how to react. Penny reached over and played with the tip of my place mat.\n\nI couldn’t leave. I couldn’t, I couldn’t. I tried to blink away the black spots that were suddenly dancing before my eyes. There had to be a way out. An escape. I’ll stay here, I said quickly. I can stay here, can’t I? Yes. That was it. They could go. I would stay. Ta-da! Problem solved.\n\nYou absolutely cannot stay here by yourself, Penny said.\n\nI could, I could, I could. Please?\n\nMy dad leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table and his chin in the palm of his hand. We’re going to rent out the house until the market gets better and then we’re planning on selling it.\n\nDon’t rent it! Or rent it to me! I’ll stay! Not that I had any money. But it was all I could think of.\n\nYou are not staying here without us, my stepmom told me. That’s ridiculous. And it’s not safe.\n\nWait a sec. I caught my breath, anger pushing out the panic. I narrowed my eyes at my betrayer of a father. This is why you two were in Cleveland last month?\n\nHe nodded, a bit sheepishly.\n\nI thought you were visiting Penny’s parents. Why didn’t you tell me you were interviewing? I had been oblivious, enjoying the weekend with Marissa’s family. Lalala clueless me.\n\nAnother look with Penny. We didn’t want to worry you.\n\nYeah, why would I want some time to get used to the idea? Much better to spring it on me like a knife-wielding jack-in-the-box. But now it’s all set?\n\nYes, he said. I gave my notice yesterday.\n\nSo Penny, Penny’s parents, and my dad’s company knew before I did. Way to make a daughter feel important. Did Matthew know too? Did Mom know?\n\nIt’s a beautiful city, April, Penny said, rubbing her hands together like she was washing them. I loved living there. And it’s very culturally interesting. Did you know the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is there?\n\nThe panic set in again. I can’t move, I said, struggling for air. I just can’t.\n\nIs this about Noah? she asked.\n\nNo, it’s not about Noah. Of course it was about Noah. Noah, who had filled my room with fifty helium balloons on my sixteenth birthday. Noah who helped me lug all my suitcases and badly taped boxes from my mom’s to my dad’s. Noah who had the softest hands I’d ever held. Noah who called me his cutie.\n\nBut it was not just about Noah. It was about Marissa and Vi and my whole life. I couldn’t leave everything—everyone—behind. My dad and I were close, but now he had Penny, and Penny and I . . . we didn’t have much of a relationship. She tried to connect, I tried to connect, my father tried to connect us, but it was like we had walkie-talkies that were on different frequencies. Moving to Ohio with them would be lonely. Too lonely.\n\nYou’ll meet lots of new boys, Penny said.\n\nIt’s not about Noah, I repeated, louder, over the sound of my pounding head. What was I going to do? I could not move to Cleveland in ten days. I needed a plan. Fast. They were four seconds away from packing me up and tossing me halfway across the country. I have friends here. I have . . . What else did I have? Soccer. School. I was grasping at straws, but I needed to get through to them. I had only recently started to feel settled again. I couldn’t just move. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.\n\nYou’ll make new friends. And soccer season is over, Penny said, reaching to pat me and then apparently deciding not to. You can play on a new team next year in Cleveland. And you can still keep in touch with everyone back here.\n\nI didn’t want to keep in touch. I knew all about keeping in touch and I hated it. And now I’d have to do it with Noah and all my friends. Were Cleveland and Connecticut even in the same time zone? Where was Cleveland exactly?\n\nThe black spots returned to the corners of my eyes. If I moved to Cleveland, I’d wake up every morning wishing I was still in Westport. I’d wake up every morning in the big black hole. I couldn’t let that happen. There had to be another way. Someone I could stay with here. Marissa? I sat up straighter. Yes! Maybe. No. In theory, her family would be happy to have me, but they really didn’t have the space. Marissa already shared a room with her sister. I couldn’t exactly sleep in her trundle bed for the rest of the year.\n\nNoah? Ha. Sure, I loved him, and I got along with his parents and siblings, but I wasn’t ready to share a bathroom with any of them.\n\nAnd that left . . . Vi.\n\nWait. That was it. I can live with Vi! Yes, yes, yes!\n\nYou want to live with your friend Violet? my dad asked.\n\nYes! I exclaimed. My ribs expanded as hope poured in. I can move in with Vi.\n\n\"You can’t live with a friend,\" Penny said, emphasizing the word friend like I had said family of anacondas.\n\nNot just a friend, I rushed to explain. A friend and her mom. This could work. It could really work. Vi had a funky house on Mississauga Island, right on Long Island Sound. From her living room windows you could see right onto the water.\n\nI don’t think it’s appropriate for you to move in with another family, my dad said. And I doubt Vi’s mother would agree to it.\n\nWell, I didn’t think it was appropriate—or fair—for them to yank me out of school in the middle of my junior year. Vi’s mom will be completely cool with it. Last year they volunteered to host an exchange student but it didn’t work out. Suzanne’s really laid back.\n\nDad’s eyebrows went up.\n\nNot too laid-back, I added quickly. Plus, the basement is already set up like a bedroom. Has its own bathroom and everything. I could at least ask, couldn’t I? And then we could talk about it some more? We could at least consider it?\n\nPenny wrinkled her nose. You want to move into a basement? Basements are cold and drafty.\n\nI don’t mind. A basement in Westport was better than any room in Cleveland.\n\nI don’t know, Penny said, shaking her head.\n\nIt’s not up to you, I wanted to say but didn’t. I pointedly looked at my dad, and did my best to appear reasonable and mature. Speaking slowly, I said, There’s no point in me moving all the way to Cleveland now. I have six months left of the year. Let me finish it here. At Hillsdale. I love Hillsdale. I’ll be fine at Vi’s. She’d love to have me.\n\nA furrow formed in Dad’s brow.\n\nPlease?\n\nBut what about next year? Isn’t Vi a senior? my dad asked.\n\nLet’s deal with this year first. If I have to move next year, I’ll move next year. There was no way I was moving next year either. But who knew what the situation would be by then? Once upon a time I lived with my mother, father, and brother at 32 Oakbrook Road, but that had changed too. Who knows? Maybe you’ll hate Cleveland and want to come back. Or maybe Vi will still be here next year. Yeah, right. Vi had big plans and they involved colleges far, far away from Westport. Can’t we try Vi’s for this semester? Please? By the final please I had tears in my eyes and a quivering lip.\n\nNo one spoke.\n\nI wasn’t sure what I expected. I kind of doubted they were actually going to let me move in with a friend. I wouldn’t have let me move in with a friend. When the pause continued, I thought I was done for.\n\nI guess we can talk to Violet’s mother, my dad said at last.\n\nI jumped out of my chair and threw my arms around him.\n\nTINY COMPLICATION\n\nI left two messages on Vi’s cell on Thursday night but she didn’t call me back. She was probably busy with some sort of party. We’re Jewish, so to me it was the Day Dad Told Me He Was Moving, but to the majority of the world it was Christmas. I hadn’t told her the details, only that I needed to talk to her.\n\nShe called me back Friday morning at eleven.\n\nEverything okay? she asked. I just called in for my messages. My mother borrowed my cell yesterday and can’t remember where she left it.\n\nI filled her in, then held my breath. What if after all this Vi didn’t want me there?\n\nOf course you can live with me! Of course my mom won’t mind! I absolutely cannot let you move to Cleveland! Hells no!\n\nWhoosh—I exhaled with relief.\n\nWe’re going to be housemates! she squealed.\n\nI would have used the word roommates myself, but Vi was a housemates type of girl. Housemate sounded sophisticated. Roommate was for kids. Vi was also the type of girl who hated being called a girl. She was a woman, thank you very much. She drank wine, wore her hair in a short black bob, worked out every morning, edited the school paper, and read the New York Times daily. Girl would not do. Vi rocked.\n\nVi and I went to the same preschool. Back then the classes were mixed, three- and four-year-olds together. Vi and I bonded. Our moms bonded. Eventually Suzanne and my mom lost touch, but Vi and I stayed friends over the years even though we weren’t in the same grade, even though we didn’t run in the same crowds. Sometimes we overlapped—like the night of The Incident. But usually we stayed to our own social circles. We always stayed friends though.\n\nWe’re going to have a blast, she continued.\n\nWe would have a blast. Living with Vi and Suzanne would not be like living with my dad and Penny.\n\nLet’s take a second to compare, shall we?\n\nEvery bed in our house was required to have hospital corners. I was told to please use a pillow if I was going to lean against my linen headboard. Vi and her mom, on the other hand, both had water beds. I’d never seen Suzanne’s water bed made. Vi’s house smelled like cinnamon incense. Mine smelled like hand wipes with a splash of Lysol. Due to The Incident, my curfew was ten P.M. Suzanne did not believe in curfews. Anyway, they’d be tough to enforce since her shows usually went until eleven and she herself was never home before one at the earliest.\n\nOne more Suzanne/my dad comparison: Suzanne was spontaneous. She had last-minute potluck dinners and marathon movie nights. My dad and Penny scheduled sex. Every Tuesday and Saturday at eleven. I tried to be asleep. It wasn’t like it was on the calendar, but I could hear the Barry Manilow playing like clockwork. Can you imagine . . . scheduling sex? Could anything be less romantic?\n\nOkay, so Noah and I were trying to schedule sex—tonight?!—but clearly, that was for a different reason. We couldn’t spontaneously get a place to ourselves.\n\nThis is perfect, Vi continued. \"You have no idea how perfect. My mother was just offered the lead role in the traveling production of Mary Poppins.\"\n\nI laughed. Your mother is playing Mary Poppins?\n\nYes. I see the irony.\n\nFor how long?\n\nIt’s a six-month contract. The show starts in Chicago for six weeks and then moves around the country. She’ll be relieved if I have someone to hang out with.\n\nHoly crap. The two of us . . . in your house? The two of us. In her beach house. With no parents.\n\nHells yeah! Isn’t that perfect?\n\nYour mom is fine with leaving you alone?\n\n\"Darling. Finding work is tough these days, and my mom’s not getting any younger or any thinner. She’s twice the size she used to be. If she’s offered Traveling Mary Poppins, she’s taking Traveling Mary Poppins.\"\n\nSuzanne"
