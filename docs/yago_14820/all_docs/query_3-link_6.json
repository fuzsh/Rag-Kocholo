She was a sociopath. But even though the disorder had been identified a century earlier, sociopathy had been neglected by mental health professionals for decades. She was told there was no treatment, no hope for a normal life. She found herself haunted by sociopaths in pop culture, madmen and evil villains who are considered monsters. Her future looked grim.\n\nBut when Patric reconnects with an old flame, she gets a glimpse of a future beyond her diagnosis. If she’s capable of love, it must mean that she isn’t a monster. With the help of her sweetheart (and some curious characters she meets along the way) she embarks on a mission to prove that the millions of Americans who share her diagnosis aren’t all monsters either. This is the inspiring story of her journey to change her fate and how she managed to build a life full of love and hope.\n\nPatric Gagne is a writer, therapist, and advocate for people suffering from sociopathic, psychopathic, and anti-social personality disorders. She earned a PhD in clinical psychology with a dissertation that examined the relationship between sociopathy and anxiety. This research became the groundwork for her continued studies on sociopathic disorder, as well as the foundation for her memoir. Today she is working to expand the definition of sociopathy to include its status as a spectrum disorder. She did her undergraduate work at UCLA and earned her masters and doctorate at California Graduate Institute, Los Angeles.\n\nBetsy Beers is a groundbreaking producer and the longtime producing partner of Shonda Rhimes.

Now a bestselling author, Helen pours everything into her career. Grant has done everything in his power to move on from the past, including building a life across the country. And while the panic attacks have never quite gone away, he’s well liked around town as a screenwriter.\n\nWhen secrets come to light, they must reckon with the fact that theirs was never meant to be any kind of love story. And yet… the key to making peace with their past—and themselves—might just lie in holding on to each other in the present.\n\nCandice Lim is the co-host of ICYMI, Slate’s podcast about internet culture. She comes to Slate from NPR, where she was an assistant producer and occasional panelist on Pop Culture Happy Hour. She graduated from Boston University and hails from Orange County, California.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Vroman’s\n\nDate: Tuesday the 9th\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress:695 E.

Morton became nationally famous as a composer and bandleader in the 1920s, but got his start twenty years earlier, entertaining customers in the city’s famous bordellos and singing rough blues in Gulf Coast honky-tonks. He recorded an oral history of that time in 1938, but the most distinctive songs were hidden away for over fifty years, because the language and themes were as wild and raunchy as anything in gangsta rap.\n\nRevelatory and fascinating, these songs and stories provide an alternate view of Black culture at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Book Soup\n\nDate: Wednesday the 10th\n\nTime: 7 pm – 8:30 pm\n\nAddress: 8818 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\nWebsite: https://www.booksoup.com/event/elijah-wald\n\nFariha Róisín & Survival Takes a Wild Imagination at North Figueroa Bookshop – In-Person Event\n\nFariha Róisín will discuss and read poems from her collection, Survival Takes a Wild Imagination.\n\nIn the powerful follow up to her critically acclaimed debut collection, poet and activist Fariha Róisín is writing, praying, clawing, and scratching her way out of the grips of generational trauma on the search for the freedom her mother never received and the kindness she couldn’t give.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: North Figueroa Bookshop\n\nDate: Wednesday the 10th\n\nTime: 7 pm – 9 pm\n\nAddress: 6040 N.

He begins with a simple mystery of motion. When we drive at highway speeds with the windows down, the wind beats against our faces. Yet our planet hurtles through the cosmos at 150 miles per second, and we feel nothing of it. How can our voyage be so tranquil when, as Einstein discovered, matter warps space, and space deflects matter?\n\nThe answer Strassler reveals, is that empty space is a sea, albeit a paradoxically strange one. Much like water and air, it ripples in various ways, and we ourselves, made from its ripples, can move through space as effortlessly as waves crossing an ocean.\n\nAccessible and profound, this book is the ultimate guide to our place in the universe.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: Vroman’s\n\nDate: Wednesday the 10th\n\nTime: 7 pm\n\nAddress: 695 E.

Moving between hotel lobbies and all-night clubs, these poems chronicle life spent in spaces that are stalked by transaction and reward. Written with Māori moteatea, purakau, and karakia (chants, legends, and prayers) in mind, her work explores the way the past comes back, even when she tries to turn her back on it. “I was forced to remember that,/wherever I go,/even if I go nowhere at all,/I am still a descendent of mountains.”\n\nHarryette Mullins’ latest chapbook Open Leaves / poems from earth (Black Sunflowers Poetry Press) unwraps in lush haiku and poetic prose savoring the abundance of a flourishing landscape, with concern for the fragility of the land on which life depends. Harryette’s verdant and troubling poetry is paired with Tiffanie Delune’s sensuous, pulsating artwork.\n\nBook signing & reception with light refreshments will follow after the readings.\n\nNOTE: See site for further details, tickets, and information.\n\nWhere: Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center\n\nDate: Wednesday the 10th\n\nTime: 8 pm – 10 pm (Doors at 7:30 pm)\n\nAddress: 681 Venice Blvd. Venice, CA\n\nWebsite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-of-poetry-tayi-tibble-harryette-mullen-tickets-862579587767?aff=oddtdtcreator\n\nPoetry Reading & Open Mic by Two Idiots Peddling Poetry with Ben Trigg and Featured Guest Steven Hendrix at The Ugly Mug – In-Person Event\n\nHost Ben Trigg and Two Idiots Peddling Poetry at the Ugly Mug on Wednesday Nights offers a Reading & Open Mic with featured guest Steven Hendrix.\n\nSteven Hendrix received his M.A. in Comparative Literature from CSULB.

De Anda, Daryl Gussinat Page Against the Machine – In-Person Event\n\nTrenches Full of Poets is a monthly reading series created, curated, and hosted by Los Angeles-based poets and editors, Nikolai Garcia and Mauricio Andres Moreno with the goal of supporting published SoCal authors and the local independent bookstores that carry their works.\n\nTonight’s features include:\n\nJesse Tovar is the founding editor of Mobile Data Mag on Substack and Systemic Dreaming on Threads.

In 2006, he became integrally involved in 𝘙𝘢𝘻𝘰𝘳𝘤𝘢𝘬𝘦 fanzine where he is currently the managing editor. His writing revolves around the honest, bittersweet, and ultimately triumphant aspects of counterculture and its flavorful inhabitants. The heartbreaks, the implosions, and the defiant victories.

Welcome to the Morningside.\n\nAfter being expelled from their ancestral home in a not-so-distant-future, Silvia and her mother finally settle at The Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in a place called Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family’s past, and because the once-vibrant city she lives in is now half-underwater. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she fully understand why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an opening: a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia’s lonely and impoverished reality.\n\nNOTE: See site for RSVP, tickets, guidelines, and details.\n\nWhere: pages: a bookstore at Slay Italian Kitchen\n\nDate: Friday the 12th\n\nTime: 9:30 am\n\nAddress: 1001 Manhattan Ave., Manhattan Beach, CA 90266\n\nWebsite: https://www.pagesabookstore.com/event/special-luncheon-obreht-conversation-seth-fishman\n\nCurrent Events Nonfiction Book Club: Beaverland at Studio City Branch Library, LAPL – In-Person Event\n\nBook Club participants will discuss Beaverland: how one weird rodent made America by Leila Philip.\n\nRSVP:\n\nPlease email studio@lapl.org for participation details.\n\nNOTE: See site for details.\n\nWhere: Studio City Branch Library, LAPL\n\nDate: Friday the 12th\n\nTime: 12 pm\n\nAddress: 12511 Moorpark St., Studio City, CA 91604\n\nWebsite: https://lapl.org/whats-on/events/current-events-nonfiction-book-club-1\n\nYour Author Series: Charlotte Cheng & ROAR-CHOO! via Central Library, LAPL – In-Person Event\n\nYour Author Series presents Charlotte Cheng to read and discuss her children’s book ROAR-CHOO!\n\nEveryone knows that dragons are fierce, capable of taking on the world!
