        "text": "A Q&A in Which We (Other Authors) Ask Sarah Mlynowski a Bunch of Questions and She Answers Them\n\n(part two)\n\nSarah, I heard a rumour you are no longer in high school. But every time I read one of your young adult novels, I’m amazed by how perfectly right those years feel. So what’s your secret to always delivering such a vividly realized high school experience?\n\n—ADELE GRIFFIN\n\nAdele is the author of a number of YA novels, including Tighter and Loud Awake and Lost. She is thinking that nobody will notice if she finishes Courtney’s brownies.\n\nSarah: Thanks, Adele! I feel the same way about your books. I try to talk to a lot of teens, read a lot of teen books and magazines, and watch a lot of teen television shows and movies. That’s to stay current about what fifteen-year- olds are thinking. And not, um, at all because I think Josh Hutcherson is adorable (Team Peeta! Woo!). But most of my research comes from my own high school diaries, pictures, and memories. Times may change, but emotions stay constant. Angst is angst. I’m guessing finding out your high school boyfriend cheated on you with an eighth grader named Kimmy would pretty much feel as miserable today as it did back then. Yes. Her name really was Kimmy.\n\nYou are both a prolific and diverse writer and the mother of a pre-schooler and a toddler. How do you do it? No, seriously, how? Is there magic involved? A special “flu” shot?\n\n—GAYLE FORMAN\n\nGayle is the author of If I Stay and Where She Went, and Just One Day and Just One Year. She is also the mother of two young children and often doesn’t quite know how she does it or if she does.\n\nSarah: Unlike the character Courtney, I don’t take Adderall. But I do drink a lot of coffee. Regular coffee, mocha Frappuccinos, caramel Macchiatos, espressos… also brownies, as I’ve already mentioned. Oh, have you tried chocolate-covered coffee beans? You will never sleep again.\n\nHmm, I am also wondering why there is no character named Lauren, and I can only assume it is because for a writer to suspend her disbelief and create her world, she has to be able to separate herself from the real world. Perhaps I am so awesome that you couldn’t possibly create a fake Lauren to replace the real me? But you asked for questions, not comments, so here is my question (and excuse me if I mumble; my mouth is full of one of Courtney’s scrumptious brownies): Girls with magical powers show up in a lot of your novels, including this one. Also, you often write about strong, awesome friendships. If you, in real life, had to choose between having a magical power or an enduring friendship, which would you choose?\n\n—LAUREN MYRACLE\n\nLauren is the author of TTYL and Shine. She is thinking about how much she adores Sarah, and how she hopes Sarah adores her back. And her front. Well. You know.\n\nSarah: Mwah! And yes, you are so awesome. But I will still make sure that my next book has a Lauren! She will be the best character who ever was! She will be in kick-ass shape, plus have a zillion tattoos, plus have written multiple New York Times bestsellers. (Three traits conveniently shared by both you and Lauren Oliver.) But just so you feel extra loved, fictional Lauren will also adore pink glitter, rhino- dogs, and emoticons. Now as for your question, if I had to choose between magical powers and an enduring friend- ship I would choose…a magical power. I was totally supposed to say enduring friendship, eh? But c’mon! Flying! Mind reading! Spider-Man hands! Witchcraft! But don’t be mad! I’ll totally share my spell book with you.\n\nThe Magic in Manhattan series is set in New York City and so is Don’t Even Think About It. What interests you most about New York, and do you see yourself saying anything about the city in these books?\n\n—E. LOCKHART\n\nE. wrote How to Be Bad with Sarah and Lauren. She too is a fan of rhino-dogs. Also drittens. Alone she wrote The Boyfriend List, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks, and We Were Liars. She is thinking about getting a flu shot now.\n\nSarah: The thing about living in New York City is that I would not be at all surprised to discover that magic does in fact exist here. The person in front of you at Starbucks is telepathic? All right. A practicing witch lives in the apartment below you? Of course. The streets in this city literally sparkle. Anything can happen here.\n\nYou grew up in Canada and now live in and write about the US. What do you think are the biggest differences and similarities between US and Canadian teens?\n\n—ALLY CARTER\n\nAlly is the author of the Gallagher Girls and Heist Society series. She wishes her hair were as pretty as Sarah’s.\n\nSarah: Oh, please. I wish I were a blonde like you. As for the difference between Canadian and American teens—I’d say that Canadians watch less TV. This is not because they don’t like TV, but because their channels aren’t as good. Americans definitely watch more Degrassi. They’re obsessed with it. Maybe Canadian teens don’t watch as much TV because they are too busy on Facebook. Seriously, Canadian teens are on Facebook all the time. I think they get automatically signed up at birth. It’s like Medicare. Canadians teens also say things like “eh?” and “keener.” And they eat poutine (French fries, gravy, and cheese curds), Cherry Blossoms (yummy chocolate treats), and ketchup chips (self-explanatory). American and Canadian teens aren’t that different, though. Both hang out at the mall. Both find their parents annoying. Both love books by Ally Carter.\n\nDo you have a playlist for Don’t Even Think About It?\n\n—JULIA DE VILLERS\n\nJulia is the author of many books, including the Trading Faces series co-authored with her twin sister, about identical twins who have “twin ESP.” Julia is daydreaming about Degrassi’s Joey Jeremiah and his fedora.\n\nSarah: If by playlist you mean what songs did I listen to while writing, I didn’t. I prefer to write alongside other people, and I assume they’d find my desire to listen to “Call Me Maybe” on repeat a hundred times in a row annoying. (Did you know Carly Rae Jepsen is Canadian? Go Canucks!) Working with others makes me feel like part of a community. Also, when I spend too much time by myself I start to talk to the television.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\n—JENNIFER E. SMITH\n\nJennifer is the author of several books, including The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight and This Is What Happy Looks Like. She is thinking about where to travel next and hoping maybe Sarah will offer to show her around Canada…\n\nSarah: There is nothing that would make me happier than showing you all my favourite Canadian haunts. Oooooh, can we do a book signing together in Montreal? Or maybe New York? Pretty please, with a Cherry Blossom on top? As for what’s next for me: Think Twice, the sequel to Don’t Even Think About It. More secrets! More scandals! More ESP! And now that I’m finished answering the fabulous questions from these amazingly talented and incredibly generous authors, I’m going to get back to it. Well, first I’m going to see if there are any brownies left, but then I’m going to write.\n\nFor Part One check out Queen of Contemporary- HERE\n\nSarah was born in Montreal, Canada. After graduating with an honors degree in English literature from McGill University, she moved to Toronto to work for Harlequin Enterprises. While she never met Fabio, she used her romance publishing experiences to fuel her first novel MILKRUN.\n\nSince then Sarah has written four additional novels for adults: FISHBOWL, AS SEEN ON TV, MONKEY BUSINESS and ME VS. ME, and the teen novels BRAS & BROOMSTICKS, FROGS & FRENCH KISSES, SPELLS & SLEEPING BAGS and PARTIES & POTIONS—all in the ‘Magic in Manhattan’ series, as well as GIMME A CALL and TEN THINGS WE DID (AND PROBABLY SHOULDN’T HAVE). She is also the author of FAIREST OF ALL and IF THE SHOE FITS (JAN 2013), the first two books in the Whatever After series for ages 8-12.\n\nSarah’s books have been translated into twenty-one languages and optioned by Hollywood. She now lives in New York City with her husband and daughter.\n\n@SarahMlynowski\n\nwww.sarahm.com\n\nThis is the story of how we became freaks. It’s how a group of I’s became a we.\n\nWhen Class 10B got their flu shots, they expected some side effects. Maybe a sore arm. Maybe a headache. They definitely didn’t expect to get telepathy. But suddenly they could hear what everyone was thinking. Their friends. Their teachers. Their parents. Now they all know that Tess has a crush on her best friend, Teddy. That Mackenzie cheated on Cooper. That Nurse Carmichael used to be a stripper. Some of them will thrive. Some of them will break. None of them will ever be the same.\n\nA smart and funny story about friendship, first love and surviving high school from the bestselling author of Ten Things We Shouldn’t Have Done.\n\nThanks to Books with Bite you can win a copy of Don’t Even Think About It AND Ten Things We Shouldn’t Have Done,\n\nenter HERE\n\nGiveaway is for UK & IRE only.\n\nCloses 10 May 2014.\n\nEdit: Winner is Tracy K Nixon"
