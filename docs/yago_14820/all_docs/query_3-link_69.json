        "text": "Welcome to “Creating CTAs that Work, Part 2!” In Part 1, we discussed building rapport with your audience. . You’ve captured their attention, so how do you generate leads. Email marketing is the common lead generator across all small business types. Step 1: Create a FREE resource. This could be a guide or tip sheet of some sort that your followers aren’t able to access unless they provide their email address. Create the resource and the web page redirect that asks your audience for their email address. Though requiring a bit of up-front work, it pays off! Step 2: Peak interest! Generate an engaging CTA encouraging people to take those extra steps. Explain why doing so is of value to them, then detail how they can receive the resource from you. Example: Comment ‘YES’ to receive your free guide to maximizing accessibility features on your website! DM me to gain access to your free guide to customer service hacks! Pro Tip: If you ask your audience to go to the link in your bio on Instagram, it won’t be pushed by the algorithm. Instead: try asking your followers to comment or DM you if they would like the resource. Now that you’ve got people signing up for your emails and accessing your amazing work, they're on the fast track to buying from you or hiring you in the future! Found this post helpful?
