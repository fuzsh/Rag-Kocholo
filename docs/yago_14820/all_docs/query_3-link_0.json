        "text": "Kevin Red and his parents left China in 2007, bound for a new life in the U.S. He was 20 years old, and wasn’t sure how he was going to support himself, but his driving notion was that he wanted to make enough money to help his parents retire early. He heard there were more opportunities to make money in the U.S. than in China, and he wanted his piece of the American Dream. He started working in restaurants, and by 2010 he managed to open his first restaurant—Café Jr Sushi Restaurant—on W. Broadway, just below Chambers. In this interview, he discusses finding his footing in his new country and how grateful he is to be here. Everything in his life is falling into place, with one notable exception: He’s still single. And ladies, he’s looking!\n\nWhen did you come to the U.S.?\n\nI came in April 2007 from Fujian, China.\n\nWhat barriers did you face when you moved here from China? Language?\n\nYes. My native language is Mandarin and I didn’t speak any English at all. I still barely speak it, but I’m starting to find it easier to understand people. [We used a translator.]\n\nWhat did you expect life in the U.S. to be like?\n\nMy image of it was as a place where I could make more money than I could in China and help my parents retire earlier. It seemed like a place of great opportunity. I also thought of it as a place where I could settle down, marry, and own a business.\n\nAnd has it been?\n\nDefinitely. I have my own restaurant and I’m certainly more responsible now. I didn’t think this way in China. I’m not married though, so if you know anyone….\n\nWhy did you open your first restaurant in Tribeca?\n\nSome friends introduced me to the area. I realized there were lots of offices and good foot traffic, so it seemed like a perfect location for a restaurant. With my parents’ help, I opened up in this spot at W. Broadway and Chambers. It was a sandwich shop before so it was easy enough to convert it into a restaurant.\n\nWhat do you miss about China?\n\nMy grandparents. But my grandfather passed away last year, and my grandmother just moved here to live with my uncle, so I’ll be seeing more of her.\n\nHave you ever felt like it was a mistake to move here?\n\nSometimes in the beginning, when working at a restaurant seemed so overwhelming. I didn’t know anything about the restaurant industry when I moved—I had never even sliced vegetables. Everyone tried to bully me, but the salary—and knowing I could never make that kind of money in China—kept me going back. And now I’m thankful for the Americans who taught me the restaurant business because it helped me open a restaurant of my own.\n\nHow is life in China different from life in the U.S.?\n\nIn China, you only meet Chinese people, but in the U.S. you can meet people from all over the world. I like learning from people of multiple nationalities and cultures. Also, in China you need connections to get things done—it’s more about who you know. In the U.S., it’s more fair. You don’t need connections to open a business.\n\nWhat’s similar?\n\nWork. We wake up early, work, and generally have a monotonous life that’s all about work.\n\nWhat do people in China think about the U.S.?\n\nThe majority of people like the U.S. and would jump at the chance to move here. It’s seen as an opportunity. But it’s difficult to come here since it’s so expensive to get a passport and visa. And the plane trip is expensive, too. Rich people don’t want to come here as much though, because they already have enough in China.\n\nAre you happy that you moved here?\n\nYes. America gave me the chance to learn the restaurant business and open my own restaurant. That wouldn’t have happened if I had stayed in China. I’m very happy that I moved here.\n\nAbout the author: Anojja Shah (left) is a Tribeca mom who spends her days running after a feisty 3-year-old.
