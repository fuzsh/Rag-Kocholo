        "text": "Canadian Books reviewed in 2017:\n\nSince 2009, I've been a participant in the Canadian books challenge. That was the year my niece was born. She and her brother are Canadian (and their parents are now naturalized citizens). I figured one thing I could do to be a good, albiet, distant aunt, was to learn about her country through their books. I do run a book blog, after all.\n\nNow besides the four of them, my in-laws are also in the process of moving to Canada to live their full time. That won't happen this year, but it probably will by 2019. With now half of my immediate family living up there, Canadian books have become a way of life for my reading (along with following the news and social media happenings too).\n\nThis summer I realized these books were so much a part of my daily reading, that I could easily commit to reviewing a Canadian book once a week. So that's what I started to do, starting in August. I have reviews planned through the first week of March.\n\nDecember\n\nFrom Ant to Eagle by Alex Lyttle\n\nBoundless by Jillian Tamaki\n\nMacy McMillan and the Rainbow Goddess by Shari Green\n\nNovember\n\nWe Are the Engineers by Angela Melick\n\nThe Lotterys Plus One by Emma Donoghue\n\nBlack Hammer Volume 1: Secret Origins by Jeff Lemire\n\nMrs. Saint and the Defectives by Julie Lawson Timmer\n\nOctober\n\nAll Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai\n\nSaints and Misfits by S.K.
