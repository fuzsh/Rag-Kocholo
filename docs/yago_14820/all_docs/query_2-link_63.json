With the current challenge that ends on June 30th, I had my best year, managing to keep to my goal of reviewing 52 (or one Canadian book a week). The actual goal is read and review 13 (one for each province).\n\nLast year's theme was the great Canadian Road Trip, which was perfect for my Road Narrative Project. While I didn't read every single book recommended on the blog, I did manage to find and read a number of them, expanding my understanding of how Canadian road narratives are similar yet different from those written and published in the States.\n\nThis year's theme is roadside attractions of Canada. So last year the goal was to get from point A to point B. Now I guess we're supposed to stop along the way and take in the sights.\n\nBooks read during the 11th Canadian Books Challenge\n\nAn asterisk indicates the Canadian person involved or covered in the book if the author isn't Canadian.\n\nAdventure on Whalebone Island by M.A. Wilson\n\nAll Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai\n\nBlack Hammer Volume 1: Secret Origins by Jeff Lemire\n\nBlack Hammer Volume 2: The Event by Jeff Lemire\n\nBloom: A Story of Fashion Designer Elsa Schiaparelli by Kyo Maclear and Julie Morstad\n\nBoundless by Jillian Tamaki\n\nCanada and the Canadian Question by Goldwin Smith\n\nCadillac Couches by Sophie B.
