        "text": "About the Book\n\n“A delightful tongue in cheek twist on fairy tales and the magic school genre. Mixing the modern with the magical, author Alex London skewers popular fairy-tale tropes with a sharp wit and a loving, lighthearted touch, telling an empowering story where princesses learn to be their own fairy godmothers.” —Soman Chainani, author of The School for Good and Evil\n\n“A slick, sly, and clever love letter to fairy tales. The Princess Protection Program is a celebration of changing the narrative to fit the person you are and not the person people want you to be. It's the fairy tale we need.”—Roshani Chokshi, New York Times bestselling author of Aru Shah and the End of Time\n\n“A clever and laugh-out-loud tale of friendship, magic, and princesses—and a prince—who learn to rewrite their own stories. Absolutely charming.” —Sarah Mlynowski, New York Times bestselling author of the Whatever After and Best Wishes series\n\n“A fast-paced, fun, and whimsical read about defining your own destiny.” —Claribel A. Ortega, New York Times bestselling author of the Witchlings series\n\nWhere can a princess hide if her Ever After isn’t all that Happy? Bestselling author Alex London turns classic fairy tales on their heads in this fast-paced, funny fantasy about embracing change and taking control of your own story. For fans of the School for Good and Evil and the Chronicles of Never After series.\n\nEvery fairy tale ends with its characters living happily ever after, right? A valiant prince quests long and hard to reach the castle where the sleeping princess lies. And with a kiss, he awakens her.\n\nBut what if the princess does not think a kiss from a stranger is a very pleasant way to wake up? Yuck!\n\nWhen Rosamund flees her prince, a Door of Opportunity opens, and she steps through it to the Home Educational Academy (the HEA for short). Rosamund has found the Princess Protection Program, where fugitive fairy-tale princesses escape unwanted affections, untimely ends, and all the other perils of their stories.\n\nBut the longer Rosamund lives in the real world, the more questions she has. Does anyone ever graduate from the HEA? Why doesn’t anyone seem to remember the former students? Is the kindly fairy headmistress all she appears to be? Is anyone? And the most important question of all: Can Rosamund change her story?\n\nAcclaimed and bestselling author Alex London weaves together several beloved fairy tales in this fast-paced, funny, and slyly subversive adventure about finding your place in the world.\n\nCritical Praise\n\n“The Princess Protection Program is a delightful tongue in cheek twist on fairy tales and the magic school genre. Mixing the modern with the magical, author Alex London skewers popular fairy-tale tropes with a sharp wit and a loving, lighthearted touch, telling an empowering story where princesses learn to be their own fairy godmothers. An action-packed fantasy romp that young readers won’t want to put down.” — Soman Chainani, author of The School for Good and Evil\n\n“A slick, sly, and clever love letter to fairytales. London's characters are achingly real and full of hope and yearning in their pursuit of an ending on their own terms. The Princess Protection Program is a celebration of changing the narrative to fit the person you are and not the person people want you to be. It's the fairytale we need.” — Roshani Chokshi, New York Times–bestselling author of Aru Shah and the End of Time\n\n“A clever and laugh-out-loud tale of friendship, magic, and princesses—and a prince—who learn to rewrite their own stories. Absolutely charming.” — Sarah Mlynowski, New York Times–bestselling author of the Whatever After and Best Wishes series\n\n\"A unique and exciting take on fairy tales, The Princess Protection Program is a fast-paced, fun, and whimsical read about defining your own destiny.\" — Claribel A. Ortega, New York Times–bestselling author of the Witchlings series\n\n“A lighthearted modern take on the adventures of fairy-tale princesses.” — Kirkus Reviews\n\n“For Rosamund, a kiss from a prince wasn't all it was cracked up to be, and she flees . . . to the modern world. Here, she discovers she isn't the only fairy tale leading character who wanted out. . . . Rosamund and her new friends . . . take control of their own stories once they uncover the truth about the princess protection program. . . . A fresh twist on several classic Western fairy tales.” — Booklist\n\n“ London’s lively take emphasizes not just individual agency but the effects our choices have on the people around us. . . . A quick, enjoyable read with a gentle intro to some of the ways a princess (or prince) might not fit into their prescribed, often normative Happily Ever After.” — Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books\n\n“Fairy tale–based messages of empowerment come through loud and clear in this fun yet thought-provoking adventure. . . . The narrative’s emphasis on the power of embracing change and standing together against adversity provides a solid foundation for an engaging, lighthearted adventure.” — Publishers Weekly\n\n-\n\nProduct Details"
