        "text": "SEPTEMBER 8, 2001 PAGE E2 7 STL Citizen's Weekly writer Shelley Page becomes a regular contributor to Style Weekly today. In her debut column, she immerses herself in Red Dress Ink, Harlequin's foray into the \"platform-boot-wearing, butt-kicking, sexually voracious\" world of chick lit. Her column will appear every second week. 1 1 y-sX jss Tf 'rTPl CZI really cheap and wears a calculator watch to dinner to help divvy up the bill when it arrives. And most significantly, there is no ride off into the sunset .\n\nInstead, the heroine might just run off with a gal pal. The name Red Dress Ink was chosen because red signifies boldness, and a red dress suggests femininity and someone who stands out in a crowd. \"These books are Ally McBeal meets Sex and the City\" says Red Dress Ink editor Margaret O'Neill Marbury. Instead of the traditional romance formula, the stories are supposed to be about the young woman's search for happiness and meaning and all the road blocks to finding a man. You always suspect when something is described as something meets something meets something else, that you're getting a bit of a dog's breakfast repackaged by clever marketing people .\n\nHas anyone considered that when Ally meets Sex and the City we'll just end up with a bunch of over-sexed anorexics? Harlequin is planning on nothing short of world domination. They calculate that in North America alone, 22 per cent of women fall between the ages of 21 and 34, and half of these women are unmarried. That makes 16 million singletons just waiting to read books that capture the reality of their lives. Red Dress Ink debuts in November with See Jane Date, by Melissa Senate. It's about the zany love life of a 28-year- old assistant editor, followed by Milkrun in December by Sarah Mlynowski, which is about the zany love life of a 24-year-old copy editor .\n\nIf these books reflect reality, then the vast majority of twentysome-things must work as editors and read Cosmo and draw up lists with man-hunting tips to get through the week. To be fair, it's not all about frivolous dating dilemmas and career ladders. The February offering, Dating without Novocaine, by Lisa Cach, explores the thirtysome-thing horror of the biological clock. But already, some are suggesting Harlequin has miscalculated. The average age of romance readers is around 45 years of age, and these women devour 10 to 40 books a month .\n\nOne romance bookstore owner in California said she'd sent out the first book, See Jane Date, to her regular preview readers and \"no one thought it was funny or daring.\" Toni Bruner told the Orange County Register that no one even bothered to finish the book. Another romance book seller said even young women want to fantasize about bedding a cowboy. Obviously, the only way to judge is to ing like this because they think they are going to get published?\" she sighed. Poor old gals. It's only going to get worse or better, depending on your perspective .\n\nThe world's largest purveyor of romance novels, Toronto's Harlequin Enterprises, is getting into the chick-lit business. They're adding a new imprint to their stable of romance novels. Called Red Dress Ink, it's not romantic fantasy, but reality, a marriage between contemporary chick lit and the 41 million readers of romance fiction. The books will be labelled \"fiction,\" not romance; they'll be physically larger than the trade-size romance; they'll cost a more pricey $12.95. And they'll be different than romance .\n\nWhere once bodices were ripped and women ravished, now \"good-luck\" thongs are donned and heroines encounter men with only four minutes of staying power. There is no horse-back riding gazil-lionaire, and certainly no Fabio, the longhaired cover model for every ravishing romance hero. Instead there is tor Man, who's a neighbour of one of your relatives; Soldier of Fortune Guy, who says \"That's not a knife now, this is a knife,\" on a daily basis; and Family Guy, who lives at home because he claims to love his family, but is actually t's hard not to feel sorry for the old dames of modern English lit. You know, the ones who can't tell a thong from a catapult. They've got their knickers in knots because Bridget Jones and her diary have spawned a generation of platform-boot-wearing, butt-kicking, sexually voracious offspring who are gobbling up all the publishing dollars with their chick-lit \"froth,\" as Dame Beryl Bainbridge calls it .\n\nOn a radio talk show the other week in England, several real women writers of serious literature complained about the abundance of books featuring man-hungry singletons with empty lives and singular obsessions to get married, or at least, bedded down for the night Bainbridge, whose According taQueeney is apparently a lead contender for this year's Booker Prize, said: \"As people spend so little time reading it is a pity they perhaps can't read something a bit deeper, a bit more profound, something with a bit of bite to it.\" Bainbridge's book, incidentally, is set in the era of Dr. Samuel Johnson and is proudly thong Doris Lessing, the 8i-year-old feminist author of 40 books, asked why women write such \"instantly forgettable\" books. \"It's a pity that so many young women are writing like that. I wonder if they are just writ read, so for the past few days, I've been lost in a land where the protagonists calorie count, refer to Ally, Bridget and Sex and the City frequently, and make check lists similar to the ones found in magazines exactly like Cosmo. Of the two debut offerings sent out by Harlequin, See Jane Date is supposed to appeal to me more because the heroine, at 28, is at least approaching my mature 3osomething age .\n\nIt's about Jane Gregg, who has a hunky boyfriend who lives on the Upper West Side in New York and is crazy for her. Actually, she's made him up, and now that she has to bring him to a cousin's wedding, she either has to tell the truth, or find a guy. She starts hunting for the guy. In the meantime, she also has career stagnancy to worry about. Author Melissa Senate has described her book as a \"coming-of-age novel\" despite the heroine's advanced age .\n\nShe says that women come of age later now than when Judy Blume was writing her classic teenage coming of age books. While the book was amusing, I was drawn more to Milkrun, perhaps because of the gigantic wink and nod it makes to the romance book industry it's trying to revitalize. Try to keep the following scenario straight. The book is about a copy editor who works for a large publisher of romance novels called Cupid. She's constantly being asked if she knows Fabio .\n\nWell, author Mlynowski also works for a romance publishing company, in this case Harlequin. She's not a copy editor, but works in the marketing department. She's acutely aware of the differences between real life and romance. Mmm. In Milkrun, Jackie Norris is \"recently jilted and the proud owner of some fabulous post-breakup, retail-therapy boots.\" Having abandoned her half-completed MA, she had followed her boyfriend to Boston and taken a job as a copy editor at a romance publisher .\n\n\"Ironically,\" the marketing bumpff on the book says, \"that's when her love life falls part.\" Jeremy leaves for Thailand and e-mails home that he has met some- 1 one new. One day after break-up she finds herself at Orgasm, the local hot spot, where she meets a bad kisser, a stripe-wearing poet, and Tim, the four-minute man. In the book, as opposed to Mlynows-ki's life, she is constantly pointing out the differences between real life and romance. In one scene, she's contemplating sleeping with a smooth-talking poet: But how can this develop into the soul-mate relationship it's supposed to if I sleep with him right away? A real heroine would never sleep with a guy on the first date. The sexual tension would have to build to at least the ninth chapter, where it would cumulate into a \"ball of If in a moment of passion she does cave in and sleeps with him right off, she usually gets pregnant, and refuses to see him .\n\nThe next time she sees him is two years later when she accidentally runs into him at the video store. And of course, she's with her little darling boy, Adam, who has the same mysterious smile as his father. And of course, she's never forgotten Adam's father. There is one funny scene where she is finally bedding the four-minute man. In romance novel terms she describes the entire four play, only for the whole passionate clutch to collapse when reality rears its ugly head .\n\nWhen I first began reading the books, I had a feeling that I was just reading poor imitations of Bridget Jones' Diary, which, despite Bainbridge and Lessing's knocks against the book, was an excellent, laugh-out-loud creation. These Harlequins all go over the same territory as Bridget, but couldn't possibly be as funny and as poignant, and they weren't. Both, however, eventually won me over, and I ended up hoping each protagonist found some measure of happiness despite the chaos of their lives. If the romance reader devours 10 to 40 books a month, it's hard to imagine that a twentysomething would consume as many of these \"fun and flirty\" books. Remember the backlash against Ally McBeal because she couldn't get her life together? Having to repeatedly read about silly girls who follow Cosmo lists to get along in the world before bedding the four-minute man would get awfully frustrating .\n\nHarlequin knows this and will only release one a month, and each will be targeted to a slightly different age group. Laura Morris, the project manager for Red Dress Ink, doesn't expect the traditional romance readers to snap up the books, which will be marketed in an entirely different way. See Jane Date is getting a full-page ad in the New York Times. Milkrun will be promoted in campus newspapers across the U.S., and perhaps some universities in Canada. Morris says that most of the women who work at Harlequin are in the publishers target demographic and \"they really loved it .\n\nThey thought it was hilarious.\" Obviously not everyone will. Not everyone thinks Bainbridge and Lessing's books are barn-burners either. Their complaints about all the young women writing chick lit smack of crankiness and cattiness. To be sure, the young women will age and turn from thong lit to motherhood and menopause. Can Polyester Pants Ink be far behind?
