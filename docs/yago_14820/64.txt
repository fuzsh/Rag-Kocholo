Once upon a time, Abby and her little brother, Jonah, were ordinary kids. The next minute? The mirror in their basement slurped them up and magically transported them into the fairy tale of Snow White.

Yes, really!

When Abby and Jonah stop Snow from eating the poison apple, they think they're heroes. But wait! If Snow doesn't die, she won't meet her prince and get her happy ending. Oops.

Now it's up to Abby and Jonah-- with some help from Snow and the seven dwarfs--to outwit the witch and save the famous fairy tale in time.

But what if Snow's REAL happy ending is something else entirely?
