Ten Things We Did (And Probably Shouldn’t Have)

By Sarah Mlynowski

Harperteen

368 pp; $18.99Reviewed by Helen Chevreau, age 19 Upon first glance at this decidedly teen-aimed novel, it is easy to simply skim over and give it scant attention. There are so many novels aimed at teenaged girls these days that are almost identical in content and writing style. However, this is not the case for Ten Things We Did

. From the very first page I found myself engaged with the main character, April, and her dysfunctional family dynamic.

April lives with her dad and stepmother in Connecticut and is a junior in high school there. After her parents’ divorce, April’s mother and younger brother moved across the globe to Paris, so when her father springs it on her at the last second that they must move to Ohio, April is devastated. However, she quickly devises a devious lie: She ends up getting permission to move in with her best friend Vi in Vi’s parent-less house while her mother is absent for six months as the star of a travelling play.

Needless to say, two teenaged girls, no parental supervision, and a crazy allowance from April’s father, all conspire to land the girls in one crazy situation after another. From buying a used hot tub to throwing the party of the year, the 10 things April and Vi do will leave readers satisfied and wanting more.
