        "text": "Sep 17, 2017 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Eastern Wei dynasty Dongwei æ±é­ (534-550) ruled over one of the successor states of the Northern Wei empire åé­ (386-534). It belongs to the so-called Northern Dynasties åæ (386~581) and was founded by Yuan Shanjian å åè¦, who was a son of Prince Wenxuan æå®£ç of Qinghe æ¸ æ²³, a member of the ruling family of the Northern Wei, and the only ruler of the dynasty. The Eastern Wei empire covered the modern provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and Hebei. The capital was Ye é´ (near modern Anyang å®é½, Henan).\n\nIn the late 520s the powerful potentate Erzhu Rong ç¾æ±æ¦® dominated the central government of the Northern Wei empire. In 530 Emperor Xiaozhuang åé­å­èå¸ (r. 528-529) had assassinated Erzhu Rong during a court audience. His nephew Erzhu Zhao ç¾æ±å  rose in rebellion, conquered the capital Luoyang æ´é½ (modern Luoyang, Henan) and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang. Erzhu Zhao installed Yuan Gong å æ­ as the new emperor (posthumous title Emperor Jiemin åé­ç¯éå¸, r. 530-531). A former retainer of Erzhu Rong, Gao Huan é«æ­¡, began to wage a war against the Erzhu clan, with the support of the other aristocratic families of the TaÉ£baÄ. In 532 he killed Emperor Jiemin and enthroned Yuan Xiu å è© (Emperor Xiaowu åé­å­æ­¦å¸, r. 532-534). Gao Huan was from then on the factual regent of the Northern Wei court. In 534, refusing to further being the puppet of Gao Huan, Emperor Xiaowu fled to Chang'an é·å® (modern Xi'an è¥¿å®, Shaanxi) in the west and asked the local potentate Yuwen Tai å®ææ³° for his protection. Gao Huan simply enthroned Yuan Shanjian å åè¦ (Emperor Xiaojing æ±é­å­éå¸, r. 534-550) as the new emperor, an act that led to a schism of the dynasty. Yuan Shanjian ruled over the eastern half of the empire. His reign is by historians therefore called that of the \"Eastern Wei\". In the west, Yuwen Tai enthroned Prince Yuan Baoju å å¯¶ç¬ as emperor of the Western Wei dynasty è¥¿é­ (535-556).\n\nGao Huan had moved the capital from Luoyang to Ye, while he himself resided in Jinyang æé½ (modern Taiyuan å¤ªå, Shanxi). He had made himself highest commander of the Six Garrisons (liuzhen å ­é®) and was the factual regent of the Eastern Wei empire, while Emperor Xiaojing was mere his puppet. Yet Gao Huan could not have won this powerful position was it not for the support of the TaÉ£baÄ aristocracy. In turn for this support, Gao Huan bestowed large favours to the nobility and had them live the live of their own culture. The Chinese gentry on their side was given the freedom to extract as much funds from their lands as possible. Gao Huan's government was thus nourished by a high grade of corruption in the upper level. The economy of the eastern realm was, in comparison with the Western Wei empire, relatively advanced. The Eastern Wei empire disposed of a large amout of arable land, a large population, and a prospering economy. Only this circumstance made such a government like that of Gao Huan possible.\n\nGao Huan several times tried to conquer the west. In 537 his army fought with that of Western Wei at the Tongguan Pass æ½¼é, but general Dou Tai ç«æ³° was defeated and committed suicide. In the same year the battle of Shayuan æ²è, the battle of Heqiao æ²³æ© in 538, and the battle of Mangshan éå±± in 543 brought no decision. In 546 Gao Huan personally led an army to besiege the city of Yubi çå£ (modern Jishan ç¨·å±±, Shanxi). During the siege Gao Huan became sick and died in the following year, back in his residence. His sons Gao Cheng é«æ¾ and Gao Yang é«æ´ took over regency for Emperor Xiaojing. In 550 Gao Yang deposed the emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty, the Northern Qi åé½ (550-577).\n\nThere is no official dynastic history for the Eastern Wei dynasty. Its history is included in the official dynastic history of the Northern Wei, the Weishu é­æ¸ that was compiled by Wei Shou é­æ¶.\n\nTable 1.
