        "text": "Citation preview\n\nChina’s Northern Wei Dynasty, 386–535\n\nThe Northern Wei was a dynasty which originated outside China and ruled northern China when the south of China was ruled by a series of dynasties which originated inside China. Both during the time that the Northern Wei dynasty was in power and over many centuries subsequently, the legitimacy of the Northern Wei dynasty has been questioned. This book outlines the history of the Northern Wei dynasty, including its origins and the history of its southern rivals; considers the practices adopted by both the Northern Wei dynasty and its rivals to establish legitimacy; and examines the debates which preoccupied Chinese scholars subsequently. The book casts light on traditional ideas about legitimate rule in China, ideas which have enduring relevance as tradition continues to be very significant in contemporary China. Puning Liu is the associate professor of the history department, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.\n\nAsian States and Empires Edited by Peter Lorge, Vanderbilt University\n\nThe importance of Asia will continue to grow in the twenty-first century, but remarkably little is available in English on the history of the polities that constitute this critical area. Most current work on Asia is hindered by the extremely limited state of knowledge of the Asian past in general, and the history of Asian states and empires in particular. Asian States and Empires is a book series that will provide detailed accounts of the history of states and empires across Asia from earliest times until the present. It aims to explain and describe the formation, maintenance and collapse of Asian states and empires, and the means by which this was accomplished, making available the history of more than half the world’s population at a level of detail comparable to the history of Western polities. In so doing, it will demonstrate that Asian peoples and civilizations had their own histories apart from the West, and provide the basis for understanding contemporary Asia in terms of its actual histories, rather than broad generalizations informed by Western categories of knowledge.\n\nFor a full list of available titles please visit: https://www.routledge.com/ Asian-States-and-Empires/book-series/SE900\n\nChina’s Northern Wei Dynasty, 386–535 The Struggle for Legitimacy\n\nPuning Liu\n\nFirst published 2021 by Routledge 2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 4RN and by Routledge 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017 Routledge is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business © 2021 Puning Liu The right of Puning Liu to be identified as author of this work has been asserted by him in accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

To “talk” and “debate” with various politicians and historians about China’s history is a challenging task. Luckily, a great number of people provided their invaluable supports, which directly contributed to this book. It is hard to adequately express my gratitude to my supervisors, including Dr. Paul van Els, who guided me into the groves of the academe and continuously offered me kind encouragement. I owe a debt of gratitude to my other supervisors, Prof. Franke Pieke and Prof. Hilde De Weerdt, both of whom meticulously read this manuscript. Pieke’s comments on the aim and structure of my research greatly helped me improve this work; De Weerdt is a paragon of erudition who taught me to practice rigorous scholarship. I also thank Prof. Ding-Xiang Warner, who gave me crucial feedback on the thoughts of the Sui scholar Wang Tong. The committee members of my PhD defense, Prof. B. J. ter Haar, Prof. A. T. Gerritsen, Prof. C. Schwermannand, and Dr. F. Lin, all provided generous and insightful suggestions to me, many of which are embedded in this book. The study of the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy did not end after I got my PhD. I owe a great debt to those anonymous reviewers of Archiv Orienatalni and Asian History, who gave me invaluable feedback on my study on the dynasty’s legitimization and the Song scholars’ views of it. I am also grateful to the anonymous academic adviser from Routledge for his/her kind and worthy suggestions on an earlier version of this book, which ranged from the meaning of “Tuoba” to the inner Asian traditions of the Northern Wei dynasty. It is a really joyful moment when you receive so many great suggestions from such kind and knowledgeable advisers. I would also like to thank the editor Peter Sowden, who contributed a lot to this book. In addition, my colleges at the History Department of Jinan University gave me their warm encouragement. Also, the publishing of this book is supported by the Project of “The Compiling of the History of Chinese Political Philosophy”, which is funded by Renmin University, China (Project number\n\nx Acknowledgments is 18XLNG04). Finally, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my lovely parents, sister, and my wife. This book would have been impossible without their great support. In the end, I thank you, my reader. It is a great joy to see that you share with me an interest in the issue of the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy. I hope you will find as much happiness in reading this book as I experienced in writing it.

A great number of written sources, some dating back more than 3,000 years, reveal how dynasties throughout Chinese history strove to legitimize their rule and how pre-modern Chinese philosophers, historians, and politicians discussed both general principles and specific cases of legitimacy. There is a wealth of sources available to us that reveal the diverse views on legitimacy in the Chinese tradition.2 As any political power requires legitimacy to maintain its rule, this naturally applies to periods during which the geopolitical area we now know as China was governed by Han Chinese ruling houses.3 The aforementioned issue became pressing when the land was divided among several ruling houses, such as the period of the Three Kingdoms 三國 (220–280), and when China was governed by non-Han Chinese ruling houses, referred to as “Barbarians” by traditional Han Chinese people, such as the Yüan dynasty 元 (1272–1368).4 The issue became even more pressing when China was divided, and at least one of its ruling houses was non-Han Chinese. This was the case during the so-called Period of Disunion (220–589), when the northern half of the realm was governed by several non-Han Chinese ruling houses, mainly the Northern Wei 北魏 (386–535) and its several offspring, and the southern half of the realm was governed by several Han Chinese ruling houses, namely the Liu Song 劉宋 (420–479), the Southern Qi 南齊 (479–502), the Liang 梁 (502–587), and the Chen 陳 (557–589), which are collectively referred to as the Southern Dynasties 南朝 (420–589). The various ruling houses of this period, Han Chinese and non-Han Chinese alike, introduced diverse ways in which to legitimize their rule and delegitimize the rule of the other regimes. After the Period of Disunion, this “contest for legitimacy” between the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties became a topic of heated debate among a great number of Chinese scholars, who proffered diverse views on the legitimacy of specific dynasties, leading to a variety of theories on political legitimacy.\n\n2 Introduction The two factors outlined above – the fierce quest for legitimacy at the time and the heated discussions afterward – make this period eminently suitable for a study of the Northern Wei’s legitimacy as well as traditional Chinese views on political legitimacy. Moreover, as one of the first relatively successful, non-Han Chinese dynasties, the Northern Wei maintained a lengthy and strong reign, which enabled it to compete with the Han Chinese dynasties for the legitimate status. This dynasty thus initiated a significant situation in China’s history, that is, different non-Han Chinese dynasties striving to legitimatize rulership over China. A similar scenario happened various times in China’s history, non-Han Chinese dynasties, such as the Liao, Yüan, and Qing dynasties, declared themselves the rulers of the Central Realm (zhongguo 中國, one analogy of China in the ancient Chinese context). Hence, the major focus of this book is an important yet hitherto unexplored issue: The Northern Wei’s legitimacy, in the context of the non-Han Chinese dynasties’ impact on China’s history as well as the complex evolution of traditional Chinese views on legitimacy. Before looking more closely at the Northern Wei’s legitimization practices, we offer a glimpse of two crucial notions in this book: “legitimacy” and its traditional Chinese approximation, zhengtong, 正統.\n\nTheories of legitimacy The term “legitimacy,” according to the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “entered political discourse via controversies over the rightful succession to the restored French throne after the Napoleonic period (1799–1815).”5 This is quite similar to the term zhengtong, the most popular traditional Chinese approximation of legitimacy. As Hok-lam Chan points out, “the Chinese approximation of the Western concept of legitimacy, in the sense of the ruler’s mandate and the recognition of his right to govern, is known as zhengtong”; this Chinese term, which was introduced by the historian Ban Gu 班固 (32–92) during the Eastern Han dynasty 東漢 (25–220), denoted “correct affiliation or proper bloodline in reference to the genealogical transmission of the imperial family of Liu Bang, or Gaozu, the founder of the Former Han dynasty.”6 Apparently, both “legitimacy” and “zhengtong” originate from discussions about succession to the throne, in both France and China. The two terms were later imbued with fundamental political notions to denote people’s recognition and acceptance of the validity of the authority of political power. Long before the actual term “legitimacy” entered into the political field, Western thinkers were pondering the underlying idea of political legitimacy, although they used different terminology. The ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle suggested that rightful rule should accord with justice.7 Aristotle, for instance, argued that “governments which have a regard to the common interest are constituted in accordance with strict principles of justice.”8 Medieval Christian scholars introduced the idea of a divinely ordained “legitimacy.” For instance, Thomas Aquinas argued that monarchs\n\nIntroduction 3 derive authority directly from the will of God since they act as God’s vicegerents in the secular world. He suggested that the monarch should be subject to God by the command of both nature and heaven.9 During the Enlightenment, the social contract theory became prevalent in the discussion of legitimacy. Philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau reinterpreted legitimacy by introducing this theory, which, as present-day scholar Ian Hurd notes, “treats legitimacy as a contract that transfers authority between the individual and the institution.”10 Modern thinker Max Weber studied legitimacy in empirical ways. He indicated that legitimacy was a belief, saying, “The basis of every authority, and correspondingly of every kind of willingness to obey, is a belief, a belief by virtue of which persons exercising authority are lent prestige.”11 He further postulated three pure types of legitimate authority for all regimes: The traditional (i.e. legitimacy derives from societal tradition and it is possessed by inheritance, as in traditional Chinese monarchy), the charismatic (i.e. legitimacy derives from the charisma of the leader, as in Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy), and the rational-legal (i.e. legitimacy is possessed by abiding by legal procedures, as in most democratic states today).12 Following Weber’s perspective, Easton pointed out three sources of legitimacy: “from underlying ideological principles, from attachment to the structure and norms of the regime as such, or from devotion to the actual authorities themselves because of their personal qualities.”13 Lipset introduced the notion of “effectiveness” to explain the maintenance of legitimacy, saying that “prolonged effectiveness over a number of generations may give legitimacy to a political system,” while “a breakdown of effectiveness, repeatedly or for a long period, will endanger even a legitimate system’s stability.”14 Contrary to Weber, the influential modern philosopher John Rawls rejuvenated the emphasis on justice in understanding legitimacy. He indicated that the latter should rely directly on the abidance of justice, arguing that justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory, however elegant and economical, must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise, laws and institutions, no matter how efficient and well-arranged, must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.15 Many scholars also highlight the significance of democracy when discussing legitimacy. Allen Buchanan notes that “where democratic authorization of the exercise of political power is possible, only a democratic government can be legitimate.”16 Schumpeter links democracy with elections, saying that the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions which realizes the common good by making the people itself decide issues through the election of individuals who are to assemble in order to carry out its will.17\n\n4 Introduction Democracy is one of the most influential ideas in discussions about legitimacy in the present day, which underpins and ensures a representative democracy, a widely acknowledged political system that has prevailed worldwide in the modern period. For a general view of the theory of legitimacy, one should start with Habermas, who identifies two groups of scholars: “empiricists” and “normativists.”18 The former group studies legitimacy using primarily empirical methods, focusing on the constitutions, functions, and typology of legitimacy. The latter group tends to base legitimacy on various normative values, such as justice and democracy. In other words, there exist two major approaches to understanding legitimacy in Western traditions. The first comprises an empirical study of legitimacy (e.g. Weber not only describes legitimacy as a belief but also postulates three pure types of legitimate authority). The second approach views it from a normative perspective (e.g. scholars such as Aristotle and Rawls argue that just rule ensures a legitimate state, whereas others, such as Aquinas and Buchanan, establish religious devotion or democracy as the crucial value of political legitimacy). Interestingly, we see parallels between approaches adopted by Western scholars and those adopted by pre-modern Chinese scholars in the study of zhengtong, which will be described in the following.\n\nTheories of zhengtong Zhengtong 正統, as mentioned, first appeared in the Eastern Han dynasty. However, it was only from the Song dynasty 宋朝 (960–1276) onward that this term became prevalent and was used by scholars in discussing issues related to political legitimacy. By contrast, other terms, such as zhengrun 正閏 or zhengshuo 正朔, which have a similar meaning, gradually lost their popularity.19 Zhengtong’s meaning differs significantly from that of legitimacy. Hok-lam Chan points out that zheng 正 means “rightful, rectified, or legitimate,” while tong 統 could be understood as “succession or unification” in Chinese etymology.20 In practical use, zhengtong often served as an adjective that described a monarch or his dynasty as the rightful ruler of the Central Realm (the most popular analogy of China in the traditional Chinese context), which is quite similar to the use of legitimacy.21 In other cases, zhengtong referred to the rightful (zheng) succession (tong) of the throne or dynasty, or the proper (zheng) rulership (tong) of a regime.22 In addition to the two aforementioned meanings, it could also mean “proper rule” or the orthodox (zheng) tradition (tong) of an ideology. Long before the term zhengtong appeared, ancient Chinese politicians and philosophers had pondered issues related to political legitimacy. In the ancient period, the idea of divinely ordained authority prevailed. Various surviving records indicate that the rulers of the Shang dynasty 商朝 (approximately 1550–1045 BCE) ascribed their rightful rule to the divinely ordained authority of their deified ancestors and a supreme deity called\n\nIntroduction 5 23\n\n“Lord on High” (shangdi 上帝). This is somewhat similar to the medieval European idea that rightful authority derived from the will of God. The ensuing Zhou dynasty 周朝 (1045–256 BCE) expanded upon the idea of divinely ordained authority by introducing the doctrine of the “Mandate of Heaven” (tianming 天命). According to Book of Documents 尚書, a part of classical Confucian canon, Heaven – the cosmological realm wherein the natural laws of the secular world are created – granted the mandate to the king of the Zhou dynasty due to his righteous and virtuous rule, and thereby authorized him to overthrow the previous dynasty and govern the secular world.24 In the Warring States Period (453–221 BCE), Chinese philosophers introduced two kinds of fresh ideas to discuss how to determine the rightful rulership. Confucius 孔子 (551–479 BCE) indicated that the rightfulness of a ruler relied on his properly practicing both “benevolence” (ren 仁) and “rites” (li 禮), which highlighted the significance of moral behavior.25 His follower Mencius 孟子 (372–289 BCE) added that if a ruler imposed despotic policies on his people, he could lose his right to rule, which was therefore condemned to come to a premature end.26 Another ancient Chinese thinker, Zou Yan 鄒衍 (305–240 BCE), approached legitimacy in an empirical manner.27 In writings ascribed to him, he developed the doctrine of “Five Elemental phases” (wude 五德). This was based on the idea of “Five Phases” (wuxing 五行), in which five basic “phases” were identified from which everything in the universe was created: Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire, and Water.28 Introducing this idea into the political field, Zou Yan’s “Five Elemental phases” is premised on the idea that each dynasty that possesses the Mandate of Heaven inherits one of the five “elemental phases” and that each dynasty’s phase is determined by the phase of the dynasty it overcame, leading to the following succession: Earth → Wood → Metal → Fire → Water.29 To examine how this proceeds in practice: the Qin dynasty 秦朝 (221–206 BCE) declared the acquisition of the “water” phase after it had replaced the Zhou dynasty, which was marked by the “fire” phase.30 The adoption of an elemental phase de facto served as one of the dominant ways in which to legitimize dynasties in Chinese history, until this practice faded, from the Song dynasty onward.31 Thinkers during the Han dynasty 漢朝 (202 BCE–220 CE) mainly adopted these two perspectives, with some different developments. The influential scholar Dong Zhongshu 董仲舒 (179–104 BCE), for instance, introduced cosmological factors to develop Confucian ideas on legitimacy. Having established a monarch’s moral behavior as the crucial determinant of his legitimacy, Dong Zhongshu highlighted the reciprocal relationship between Heaven and the monarch, assuming that Heaven manifested its support for or objection to the monarch’s rule through auspicious portents (such as the appearance of a legendary dragon or phoenix) or ominous portents (such as floods or famine).32 Another Han dynasty scholar, Liu Xin 劉歆 (50 BCE–23 CE), reinterpreted Zou Yan’s Five Elemental phases doctrine and argued\n\n6 Introduction that the five elemental phases followed a sequence in which one phase generated its successor, in contrast to Zou Yan, who argued that the one phase overcame the other. Liu Xin then argued that the permutations of elemental phases were as follows: Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water. Following this idea, the Western Han dynasty 西漢 (202 BCE–9 CE) proclaimed Fire to be its elemental phase due to its having been directly generated by the Wood phase of the Zhou dynasty (thereby presenting the intermediary Qin dynasty as extrinsic to the permutation of phases and hence an illegitimate “leap dynasty”).33 Although it first appeared during the Eastern Han dynasty, it is only from the Song dynasty 宋朝 (960–1276) onward that the term zhengtong prevailed. Scholars had invented several innovative ways in which to understand that term. On the one hand, the famous historian Ouyang Xiu 歐陽修 (1007–1072) provided a new semantic interpretation of the term as two separate words: zheng, in his view, denoted the upright position, whereas tong referred to the unification of the Central Realm. Ouyang Xiu concluded that a dynasty could be described as zhengtong only when it commanded a just position and unified the realm.34 On the other hand, various Neo-Confucian thinkers introduced the “Heavenly Principle” (tianli天理), which Bol interprets as “the endowment of the totality of li in the person to which he could turn for moral guidance,”35 to discussions about zhengtong. The great Neo-Confucian thinker Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130– 1200), for instance, suggested that obedience of the Heavenly Principle was of considerable significance to zhengtong.36 Since Zhu Xi’s thought became the official ideology after the Song dynasty, his idea of zhengtong prevailed. From the 19th century onward, China encountered increasing challenges from the West, causing previous definitions of zhengtong to gradually lose their validity. The famous scholar Liang Qichao 梁啟超 (1873–1929) not only branded the term zhengtong ridiculous but also introduced Western views to China, arguing that only democracy and constitutionalism could justify a ruling regime.37 Following his ideas, modern Chinese scholars adopted a new concept, “in accordance with the law” (hefaxing 合法性), as a literal translation of legitimacy, with this neologism replacing the term zhengtong. In short, two major approaches were adopted in Chinese tradition to understand what we now call legitimacy. The first and most obvious was to focus on various manifestations of legitimate rule, which could be different elemental phases (as Zou Yan and Liu Xin argued), various auspicious portents (as Dong Zhongshu stressed), subscription to Confucian political principles (as Zhu Xi described), or the occupation of the Central Realm (as Ouyang Xiu pointed out). The second approach centered on the origin of legitimate rule. In terms of the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, the origin of zhengtong was a divine Mandate, and Confucians also derived it from rulers’ moral behavior or “Heavenly Principle.”\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nStudies on legitimacy in China’s history Because of its great significance, present-day scholars have widely explored two main kinds of issues concerning legitimacy in Chinese history: Traditional Chinese views on legitimacy and legitimacy disputes in China’s history. Among the general overviews of legitimacy in the Chinese tradition, the most notable one is Zhongguo shixue shang zhi zhengtong lun 中國史學上 之正統論 (Discourse on Legitimacy in Chinese Historiography) by Rao Zongyi 饒宗頤, published in 1996. The most crucial contribution of this book is its extensive collection of relevant primary sources. It places a specific focus on Chinese historiography and provides us a brief introduction to views about legitimacy found in Chinese history. Its conclusion highlights the great significance of the elemental phase theory and Ouyang Xiu’s views on zhengtong in understanding traditional Chinese views on legitimacy.38 Other scholars wrote similar general monographs on the evolution of views on legitimacy in the Chinese tradition or wrote scholarly articles to investigate the origin or general features of traditional Chinese views.39 For English readers, one of the most famous general studies can be found in the writings of Hok-lam Chan.40 The legitimacy dispute concerning Chinese dynasties has also attracted scholars’ attention. In Chinese history, there are several periods in which the issue of political legitimacy was exceptionally pressing. During these periods, in which the geopolitical area now known as China had various coexisting dynasties, such as those that existed during the Three Kingdoms and Song dynasty periods, dynasties competed with one another to be the supreme ruler of the Central Realm. The theme of this book, the Northern Wei’s legitimacy, also belongs to this category. In other cases, dynasties were short-lived, like the Qin and Sui dynasties, or ruled by non-Han Chinese monarchs, like the Yüan and Qing dynasties, respectively, and hence failed to fully achieve legitimacy. Numerous scholars, past and present, proffer distinct opinions concerning these three kinds of legitimacy disputes, which have a close relationship with the topic of this book. In this section, a brief literature review of research on these legitimacy disputes will be provided, starting with the most notable periods in Chinese history, then touching upon those less studied. 1\n\nThe first influential legitimacy dispute in China’s history took place during the period of the Three Kingdoms. After the Eastern Han dynasty collapsed, three kingdoms gradually came to stand out.41 The “legitimacy competition” occurred primarily between the Cao Wei 曹魏 (220– 265) and the Shu Han 蜀漢 (221–263) dynasties. The mighty Cao Wei occupied most of northern China, while the Shu Han dynasty declared continuity with the allegedly zhengtong Han dynasty.42 Pre-modern scholars’ opinions concerning this legitimacy dispute can be divided into\n\n8 Introduction two categories: Chen Shou 陳壽 (233–297) and Ouyang Xiu, for instance, supported the Cao Wei regime since this dynasty, in their view, possessed either the rightful elemental phase or great power and extensive territory.43 Xi Zaochi 習鑿齒 (?–383) and Zhu Xi, however, argued for the Shu Han’s legitimacy since that dynasty, in their view, was the continuation of the legitimate Han dynasty by the same royal bloodline.44 Current studies on the Three Kingdoms’ legitimacy dispute are fragmented. Most focus on specific legitimization practices. For instance, Qin Yongzhou 秦永洲 points out that cosmological propitious portents and the elemental phase doctrine were introduced by the rulers of the Three Kingdoms to underpin their legitimacy.45 David Knechtges and Howard Goodman conducted detailed studies to uncover how the Cao Wei dynasty introduced “abdication” (shanrang 禪讓) to establish its legitimate status.46 A few others have focused on scholarly discussions of the Three Kingdoms’ legitimacy dispute. Simon Shen, for instance, explains why scholars in history increasingly support the Shu Han dynasty’s legitimate status.47 Anne McLaren’s research shows that scholars in the Song and Yüan dynasties introduced their debates on the Three Kingdoms’ legitimacy dispute to promote their conception of zhengtong.48 2\n\nAnother heated topic in Chinese history was whether the Song dynasty was the legitimate ruler of the Central Realm. In its time, the Song dynasty competed with the Khitan Liao dynasty 遼朝 (907–1125) and the subsequent Jurchen Jin dynasty 金朝 (1115–1234) for the status of the legitimate ruler of the Central Realm.49 Three primary views concerning the Song’s legitimacy can be found among pre-modern Chinese scholars. Zheng Sixiao 鄭思肖 (1241–1318) and Fang Xiaoru 方孝孺 (1357–1402), for instance, supported the Song dynasty’s legitimacy because of its adherence to Chinese culture.50 Lü Zhengan 呂貞幹 (early 13th century) and Zhao Bingwen 趙秉文 (1159–1232), by contrast, ascribed zhengtong to the Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties due to their possession of the rightful elemental phase and their adoption of Chinese culture.51 A final view is represented by the Yüan scholar Xiu Duan 修端 (1279–1340), who considered all three dynasties zhengtong because of their lengthy existences.52\n\nPresent-day scholars also show an interest in the “legitimacy competition” among the Song, Liao, and Jin. Jing-shen Tao and Morris Rossabi investigated the “legitimacy competition” between the Northern Song 北宋 (960–1126) and the Liao dynasties, highlighting the fact that the two dynasties finally agreed on their equal status, at least to some extent.53 Hok-lam Chan provides one of the most influential monographs relevant to the Jin dynasty’s legitimacy in Western academia, focusing on the debate among Jin scholars on the selection of a rightful elemental phase in order to better\n\nIntroduction 9 54\n\nsupport their dynasty’s legitimacy. Liu Pujiang 劉浦江 authored a series of influential Chinese papers in which he not only investigated the legitimation methods used by the Liao and Jin dynasties but also examined how scholars in history discussed the legitimacy of those two dynasties.55 Chen Fangming 陳芳明 and Richard Davis offer a useful introduction regarding the Song scholars’ views on zhengtong.56 3\n\nIt should be noted that, in addition to legitimacy disputes among co-existing dynasties in history, scholarly questions have been posed regarding the legitimacy of two types of dynasties. Some dynasties were short-lived, such as the Qin and Sui dynasties, while others were ruled by non-Han Chinese, such as the Yüan and Qing 清朝 (1644–1911) dynasties. Although all of them “unified” the Central Realm (in that they controlled most of the area now known as China), and their supreme rule was not challenged, scholars in later periods were divided about these dynasties’ legitimate statuses.\n\nAs for pre-modern scholars, opponents of the Qin and Sui dynasties’ legitimate statuses, such as Zhu Xi and Fang Xiaoru, accused these two dynasties of having ephemeral and immoral rule, whereas supporters, such as Li Yanshou 李延壽 (?–628) and Ouyang Xiu, highlighted the Qin and Sui dynasties’ unification of the Central Realm.57 Opponents of the Yüan and Qing’s legitimacy, such as Fang Xiaoru and Wang Fuzhi 王夫之 (1619–1692), considered non-Han Chinese or “Barbarian” dynasties, as they called them, illegitimate, whereas supporters, such as Xiu Duan and Li Ciming 李慈銘 (1830–1895), applauded the Yüan and Qing dynasties for their unification of the Central Realm and adoption of Chinese cultural conventions.58 As for today’s scholars, most of them concentrate on the various legitimization practices which the aforementioned dynasties employed. For example, Li Yan 李琰 and Ming-chiu Lai show that the Qin dynasty used ancestor worship or state sacrifices to support their political legitimacy.59 Herbert Franke and Crossley separately point out that the rulers of the Yüan and Qing dynasties adopted various kinds of legitimacy practices from Chinese or nonHan Chinese culture.60 Other scholars focus on traditional Chinese thinkers’ views of these short-lived or non-Han Chinese dynasties. Liu Pujiang specifically describes how the Ming scholars viewed the Yüan’s legitimacy.61 Wei Chongwu 魏崇武, Jiang Mei 江湄, and Yang Nianqun 楊念群 conducted studies on views regarding zhengtong in the Yüan and Qing periods.62\n\nResearch on the Northern Wei’s legitimacy At the outset, it must be noted that scholars are only just beginning to recognize the complexity of these practices. Wang Chaohai 王朝海, for instance, wrote a monograph on the various legitimacy practices of the Northern Wei.63 Unfortunately, his book provides few general descriptions of the\n\n10 Introduction legitimization practices undertaken by the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties or views on legitimacy by scholars from the Period of Disunion and beyond. Other modern studies on the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute, as mentioned below, could be divided into two types: Those on legitimacy practices and those on pre-modern discussions about legitimacy. Some scholars have focused on the diverse legitimation practices employed by the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties. Kang Le’s 康樂 book describes various Chinese customs that the Northern Wei adopted to enhance its legitimacy status.64 Qin Yongzhou revealed that both the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties used Chinese cultural practices to demonstrate their legitimacy.65 Luo Xin 羅新 investigated how the Northern Wei and earlier non-Han Chinese dynasties in the Sixteen Kingdom period (4th century CE) used elemental phases to legitimize their rule.66 He Dezhang 何德章 argues that the dynastic name of “Wei” greatly supported the Northern Wei’s legitimacy in its early period.67 Lance Eccles reveals how one of the Southern Dynasties, the Liang dynasty, resorted to the practice of “abdication” to establish its legitimacy.68 Scholars such as Zhou Yiliang 周一良 and Tian Yuqing 田餘慶 also point out that the Tuoba 拓跋 rulers (the ruling ethnic group of the Northern Wei) recognized the importance of the state-sponsored historiography in supporting their legitimacy.69 Buddhism and Daoism played a significant role in supporting the Northern Wei’s legitimacy. Gu Zhengmei suggests that the Northern Wei rulers expected to become representatives of the Buddha by sponsoring Buddhism, which clearly supported their legitimacy.70 Under the sponsorship of the Tuoba rulers, the famous Yungang and Longmen Grottoes were excavated. McNair’s studies prove that the different statues of the Buddha in these grottoes were intended to represent Tuoba rulers.71 By investigating the visual representation of donors in Buddhist artworks, Wong indicates that the Northern Wei’s rulers strengthened their authority by sponsoring Buddhism.72 As Seidel and Mather point out, the Daoist leader Kou Qianzhi 寇謙之 (365–448) not only described Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei 太武帝 (r. 423–452) as the Daoist god “True Lord of Great Peace” (Taiping zhengjun太平真君) but also convinced his emperor to receive Daoist talismans and registers.73 With the help of Daoism, the Northern Wei, as Mather described, “claimed its ultimate authority from a supernatural power.”74 Several scholars have focused on traditional views about the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. Ma Xiaoneng 馬小能 suggests that historians in the Northern and Southern Dynasties period introduced the factor of Chinese ethnicity largely in order to discuss legitimacy.75 Liu Pujiang reveals the fact that discussions about the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute greatly affected Tang historians’ views on legitimacy.76 It is clear that present-day scholars have made a lot of progress in studying the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute, elucidating various legitimacy practices and traditional views. However, their studies have still failed to establish a solid basis for investigating it.\n\nIntroduction 11 First, current studies actually provide us with a fragmented image of the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. Academics pay a great deal of attention to a limited number of legitimation methods used by the Northern Wei, such as the adoption of the elemental phase and Chinese cultural practices. In fact, both the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties made use of many other legitimization practices, which deserve to be studied as a group. This is what this book will do. Second, current studies provide only a partial image of traditional opinions on the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. Few studies focus on opinions during the Song dynasty and afterward, which are more diverse than those in the previous period. A complete study of traditional views on the legitimacy of the Northern Wei could reveal shifting opinions about them and their legitimacy in history. That is a focus of this book. Third, existent studies do not offer an examination of pre-modern Chinese scholars’ discussions about the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute in order to explore traditional Chinese views on legitimacy. The topic of whether the Northern Wei was the legitimate ruler of the Central Realm indeed attracted the attention of scholars, from the Period of Disunion to the Qing period. Their diverse ideas, as this book revealed, not only provide us with clues regarding the basic doctrines and the practical criteria underpinning traditional Chinese views on legitimacy but also vividly demonstrate the evolution and disintegration of these views.\n\nContributions of this book As pointed out in the last section, existing studies not only fail to provide a comprehensive study of the legitimacy practices and traditional views on the legitimacy of the Northern Wei but also fail to explore traditional Chinese views on legitimacy. Therefore, this book aims to improve our understanding of legitimacy in Chinese history by focusing on the Northern Wei’s legitimacy dispute. It should be noted that the dispute is far too complex to be covered in its entirety within this book. In order to provide a relatively comprehensive and in-depth study, this book prefers to focus on a few significant aspects of the topic, many of which have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The book will analyze legitimation practices, pre-modern views on the Northern Wei’s legitimacy, and traditional Chinese views on legitimacy. These three contributions will be explained as follows: 1\n\nTo provide an in-depth study of the legitimation practices employed by the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties, this book comprises an investigation into a set of legitimation practices enacted by the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties. Due to space limitations, certain other issues pertinent to the Northern Wei’s legitimacy have not been investigated in this book.\n\n12 Introduction As Chapter 2 will discuss, the Northern Wei dynasty made use of seven primary legitimation practices.77 First, in its early period, the rulers of the Northern Wei dynasty changed their name from Dai 代 to Wei 魏, indicating their aspiration to borrow legitimacy from the earlier Cao Wei dynasty (220–265).78 Next, in its middle period, the Northern Wei dynasty adopted the corresponding dynastic phase from the Western Jin 西晉 (265–316), the phase of Water, to designate itself as the Western Jin’s successor. Third, during the same period, the Tuoba dynasty supported its legitimacy by transferring its capital from Pingcheng 平城 (present-day Datong 大同) to Luoyang 洛陽, a historical city that was the alleged center of All Under Heaven, the whole world known to Chinese people in history, and the capital of various previous dynasties. Fourth, the Northern Wei dynasty also recorded various auspicious portents, such as the appearances of a dragon or sweet dew, and presented these as a testimony to their legitimacy.79 Fifth, the Tuoba rulers of this dynasty adopted various Chinese cultural resources, such as Chinese surnames, language, clothes, and customs, to make their rule acceptable to the Chinese.80 Sixth, the Northern Wei sponsored historiography to strengthen their authority, which could be discerned from the Weishu. Finally, the Northern Wei dynasty strove to establish its supremacy in the field of diplomacy, forcing its vassals and opponents to accept its legitimate status. Chapter 3 will study five major ways in which the Southern Dynasties demonstrated their legitimacy. The first was to apply the tradition of “abdication” (shanrang 禪讓), whereby the last monarch of the old dynasty was forced to give up his throne “voluntarily” and transfer it to the founder of the new dynasty as a justification for their establishment by usurpation. Next, the Southern Dynasties strove to prove that their capital, Jiankang 建康 (present-day Nanjing 南京), was the rightful capital of the legitimate monarch according to an ancient prophecy.81 Moreover, these dynasties established numerous “immigrant commanderies” (qiaojun 僑郡), which borrowed the names of the original commanderies in the Northern Wei dynasty in order to symbolize their dominance over the entire Central Realm. Fourth, the Southern dynasties attempted to use the state-sponsored historiography to decorate their ruler as legitimate. Finally, in order to manifest their legitimate status in the diplomatic field, the Southern Dynasties competed with the Northern Wei dynasty in asking the surrounding states to accept their supreme status. 2\n\nThis book also strives to provide a detailed study of the intellectual history of the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. Moving in chronological order, Chapters 3–5 will examine three stages of the intellectual history of the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute.\n\nChapter 4 will study scholars during the Sui and Tang dynasties, such as Wang Tong 王通 (584–617) and Li Yanshou, who argued from historical and\n\nIntroduction 13 geographical perspectives when discussing the rightful rule. They considered both the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties to be legitimate. Another scholar, Huangfu Shi 皇甫湜 (777–835), supported the Southern Dynasties’ legitimacy because of their adherence to Confucian culture. Chapter 5 will focus on two different kinds of thinkers during the Song dynasty. Two scholars of the Northern Song dynasty, Zhang Fangping 張方平 (1007–1091) and Chen Shidao 陳師道 (1053–1102), supported the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimate status by developing Wang Tong’s ideas, while Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang 司馬光 (1019–1086), and Zheng Sixiao all rejected the legitimate states of both the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties. Chapter 6 will concentrate on scholars after the Song dynasty. The Yüan scholar Yang Weizheng and the Ming scholar Fang Xiaoru cherished Neo-Confucianism and denied legitimacy of both the Northern Wei and the Southern dynasties. Scholars of the late Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty, Wang Fuzhi and Liang Qichao, were highly critical of previous discussions on legitimacy and argued that no dynasty in history, including the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties, possessed legitimate status. Altogether, this solid selection of scholars gives us a comprehensive and representative overview of how traditional Chinese scholars solved the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. 3\n\nThis book is not intended to end with the discussion of the Northern Wei’s legitimacy issue. Rather, Chapter 7 will add to the issue to further our understanding of traditional Chinese views on legitimacy by explicating two fundamental doctrines and five practical criteria of legitimacy in the traditional Chinese context.\n\nThe first fundamental doctrine is the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, which appeared in an early period, as previously discussed. Allan describes this doctrine, saying that “heaven’s command determined the ruler. Heaven normally transferred its mandate hereditarily, but if a king violated the principles of heaven, he lost his moral imperative, and the right to rule was bestowed on another.”82 Manifestly, this doctrine explains the origin, possession, and transfer of legitimacy. It establishes the mandate from Heaven as its origin. The possession of legitimacy rested upon a monarch’s cultivation of his virtue and whether he secured the well-being of his people. The Mandate was transferred to another when Heaven removed the mandate from the monarch as a result of his failing to carry out his responsibilities and rule his people despotically or fatuously. Throughout Chinese history, the Mandate of Heaven was viewed as the most significant source of legitimacy. In most cases, this doctrine underpinned three distinct criteria in discussing legitimacy: The cosmological criterion, the moral criterion, and the historical criterion. The second fundamental doctrine is the doctrine of “All Under Heaven.”83 In general terms, this doctrine argues the difference between the Central\n\n14 Introduction Realm (zhongguo 中國 or zhongzhou 中州 and zhongyuan 中原, the place of the North China Plain originally) and Siy i四夷 (four “Barbarian” areas around the Central Realm where all non-Han Chinese settled).84 The Central Realm is the alleged center of the world as well as the cradle of Han Chinese and Chinese culture with the optimum conditions – the most fertile and humid place. The four “Barbarian” areas refer to the frontier area beyond the Central Realm and are supposedly dominated by the “Barbarian” people, with their inferior culture. This type of worldview sometimes leads to a dichotomy between “Barbarian” and “Han Chinese.” Although the people of the Central Realm historically called themselves Xiaren 夏人, Huaren 華人, Hanren 漢人, Zhongguoren 中國人, and so on, throughout this book, “Han Chinese” will broadly refer to dwellers of the Central Realm who shared the culture, languages, family ties, and other relationships with other members of the same Chinese cultural world. (Chinese people, in this book, refers to the dwellers of the geographical area that we call China today.) “Barbarian,” which is derived from the Greek barbarous, is used by modern scholarship as well as this book to translate a series of traditional Chinese terms, such as Yi 夷, Di 狄, Rong 戎, Hu 胡, and Fan 藩, which the early and medieval Chinese used to refer to peoples who lived in the “Barbarian” area.85 The dichotomy or polarity between so-called “Barbarians” and “Han Chinese” is quite prevalent. The “Barbarians” are seen as inferior, and the Han Chinese are seen as superior due to their different places of origin and the adoption of Chinese culture or Confucian codes. This dichotomy thus supports the assumption that a culturally Han Chinese ruler is the eligible recipient of the Mandate of Heaven.86 This doctrine was frequently referred to by dynasties and scholars in relation to legitimacy. This doctrine underpinned two criteria in discussing legitimacy: ethnical criterion and geographical criterion. These two doctrines support five practical criteria of legitimacy which I discovered in traditional discussions about the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute: Cosmological, moral, historical, ethnic, and geographical. These five criteria will be adopted in this book. The cosmological criterion relates to a wide range of cosmological factors, such as the auspicious portents which were seen as indicative of a dynasty’s legitimate status. The doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven supports the idea that Heaven is the origin of legitimacy, and thus cosmological phenomena are interpreted as signals from Heaven, supporting or negating a dynasty’s legitimacy. In terms of the moral criterion, legitimate status is determined on the basis of a monarch’s morality. Supported by the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, the moral criterion relates to the centrality of a monarch’s ethical principles in determining whether his rule is legitimate. In terms of the historical criterion, a rightful dynasty is defined by its historical link to the previous – purportedly legitimate – dynasty. The doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven argues that the transfer of a mandate, and therefore legitimacy, should pass between consecutive dynasties. In terms of the geographical criterion, the\n\nIntroduction 15 occupation of the Central Realm determines whether a dynasty is legitimate. This criterion is closely related to the doctrine of All Under Heaven, in terms of which legitimate rule can be found only in the Central Realm. The ethnic criterion means that a dynasty comprising Han Chinese rulers who adhere to Chinese culture could be described as legitimate. This is validated by the All Under Heaven doctrine, which implies the superior status of the Central Realm, Han Chinese people, Chinese culture, Chinese moral principles, and so on.\n\nOutline This book is divided into seven chapters. The first three focus on the various legitimation practices adopted by the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties. The fourth through sixth chapters provide a description of pre-modern Chinese scholars’ discussions regarding the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute. The last chapter explores traditional Chinese views on legitimacy. The following paragraphs will give a brief introduction to these chapters. Chapter 1 provides the historical background of the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties. It will answer the following questions. How did the Tuoba people establish the Northern Wei dynasty? What constituted the rise and fall of the Eastern Jin dynasty and the ensuing Southern Dynasties? Chapters 2 and 3 comprises a study of the “contest for legitimacy” between the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties. Why and how did the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties strive to be the rightful rulers of the Central Realm? How did they attempt to legitimize their rule? Were their efforts successful? Chapter 4 comprises an examination of the views of three scholars of the Sui and Tang periods who participated in a discussion about the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy. Why did Wang Tong argue for a transfer of legitimacy between the Southern Dynasties and the Northern Wei dynasty? Why did Li Yanshou treat both the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties as equally legitimate? How does one understand Huangfu Shi’s criticism of the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy? In Chapter 5, the focus is on two groups of scholars in the Song dynasty. Why and how did Zhang Fangping and Chen Shidao support the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy? How did Ouyang Xiu use his understanding of zhengtong to reject the legitimate status of both sides? How did Zheng Sixiao deny the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy by stressing that being Han Chinese is the prerequisite of legitimacy? Chapter 6 discusses two groups of scholars in the Ming and Qing period. How did Yang Weichen and Fang Xiaoru introduce Neo-Confucianism to discuss the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute? What are the reasons for which the late Ming literatus Wang Fuzhi and the Qing thinker Liang Qichao argued that no dynasty in Chinese history, including the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties, could possess zhengtong?\n\n16 Introduction The final chapter is intended to examine traditional Chinese views of legitimacy. Which kinds of doctrines and criteria underpinned the diverse views on the legitimacy of the Northern Wei dynasty that were proclaimed by monarchs and held by scholars during China’s history? Can one understand their views about legitimacy per se by reviewing their ideas on the Northern Wei legitimacy dispute? How do these views evolve and disintegrate throughout the course of history? What is the current influence of these views?\n\nNotes 1 S. M. Lipset, Political Man: The Social Basis of Modern Politics (New York: Doubleday, 1960), 77. 2 Although the word “legitimacy” was not used by early Chinese thinkers and historians, and therefore might appear to be used anachronistically in the context of early Chinese history, it will be used in this book to denote the general sense of their arguments in order to promote ease of understanding. This also applies to its closest Chinese approximation, “zhengtong,” which will be explained below. 3 Throughout this book, China refers to a particular set of territories governed by present China’s government. In history, these territories were ruled by one united state or various states in the disunion periods. Also, in this book, Han Chinese people broadly refers to constant dwellers of the heartland of China in history. More specific discussions will be provided below. For more on the term Han Chinese in a traditional Chinese context, see Yuri Pines, “Beasts or Humans: Pre-imperial Origins of Sino-Barbarian Dichotomy,” in Mongols, Turks and Others: Eurasian Nomads and the Sedentary World, eds. R. Amitai and M. Biran (Leiden: Brill, 2005), 59–102. 4 Pre-modern Han Chinese people tended to describe most non-Han Chinese people as barbarous and uncivilized. Therefore, scholarship nowadays uses the term “Barbarian” to refer to non-Han Chinese people in a traditional Chinese context, even though it completely disagrees with pre-modern Han Chinese scholars’ prejudices with respect to other people. For more detailed studies on “Barbarians” in a traditional Chinese context, see Yang Shaoyun, “Reinventing the Barbarian: Rhetorical and Philosophical Uses of the Yi-Di in Mid-Imperial China, 600–1300” (PhD diss., University of California, Berkeley, 2014), xiii–xviii. 5 David Beeham, “Legitimacy,” in Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed.

Oppenheim, “The Language of Political Inquiry: Problems of Clarification,” in Handbook of Political Science, Vol. 1, eds. F. I. Greenstein and N. W. Polsby (Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1975), 283–336. Habermas criticizes both groups, arguing that the former neglects the embedded normative values of legitimacy, and the latter immerses itself in a transcendent area with little concern for the empirical aspect of legitimacy. He concludes that any discussion about legitimacy should address both aspects. Ibid., 204. Lei Ge 雷戈, “Zhengshuo, Zhengtong yu Zhengrun 正朔, 正統與正閏,” Shixue yuekan 史學月刊 6 (2004): 23–31.

The other two dynasties, the Shu Han and the Eastern Wu東吳 (229–280) dynasties, were established in 221 and 229, and occupied the southwestern and southeastern parts of China, respectively. It should be noted that these dynasties called themselves “Wei,” “Han,” and “Wu,” respectively. To distinguish them from other Chinese states with similar names, people in a later period added a relevant adjective before the original names of these dynasties. 42 Before declaring its legitimate status in 263, the Sun Wu dynasty demonstrated its subjection to the Cao Wei dynasty, indicating that this dynasty nominally agreed with the Cao Wei’s supreme status.

Shaoyun, “Reinventing the Barbarian,” xiii.\n\n1 History of the Northern Wei and the Southern dynasties\n\nThe period of the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties was a dynamic time in Chinese history (Figure 1.1). As Lewis points out, it was characterized by five major historical themes: The extension of knowledge of China and the outside world, the emergence of the cultural and literary elite, the appearance of a military institution based on hereditary military households, the division between government and society, and the rise of Daoism and Buddhism.1 The focus of this chapter, however, is on the political history of the Northern Wei and Southern Dynasties, which will serve as the historical background to the Northern Wei dynasty’s legitimacy dispute. It begins with a description of how the Tuoba people, the ruling ethnic group of the Northern Wei dynasty, gradually established their state in northern China. Next, their growth and their fall are described. The political history of contemporaneous dynasties in southern China is subsequently investigated.\n\n1. The Tuoba Tribe and the Northern Wei The founders of the Northern Wei dynasty were the Tuoba,2 a northern clan of the larger Xianbei ethnic group 鮮卑族, which originated from the Xianbei Hill 鮮卑山.3 Although this group is not quite as famous as other non-Han Chinese ethnic people in China’s history, such as the Xiongnu, Mongolian, and Manchu, the Tuoba people built the first relatively successful non-Han Chinese dynasty in history, the Northern Wei, which gave birth to two great Chinese empires: The Sui and Tang dynasties. The first mention of the Tuoba people in Chinese dynastic records dates to the year 275, when the Western Jin dynasty noted that a small frontier nomad group named “Tuoba” had deferentially paid their tributes.4 Little over a century later, in 386, the Tuoba had managed to establish their own dynasty, the Northern Wei, and, another half a century later, in 439, they completely controlled northern China.5 They firmly ruled the north for nearly a century but failed to conquer southern China and finally split into two courts after a series of revolts in 534.6 How did the Tuoba tribe establish their rule in northern China and successfully exist for more than two centuries? This part will provide a general answer to that question.\n\nThe Northern Wei and Southern dynasties 23\n\nEastern Sixteen\n\nWestern Jin 265-316\n\nNorther\n\nkingdoms\n\nWei\n\n304-439\n\n386-534\n\nNorth\n\nNorther\n\nWei\n\nQi\n\n534-550\n\n550-557\n\nWestern\n\nNorther\n\nWei\n\nZhou\n\n535-557\n\n557-581\n\nSui 581-618\n\nSouth Eastern\n\nLiu\n\nSouthern\n\nJin\n\nSong\n\nQi\n\n317-420\n\n420-479\n\n317-420\n\nLiang\n\nChen\n\n502-557\n\n557-589\n\nFigure 1.1 Dynasties in the Period of Disunion.\n\n1.1. Origin and early history of the Tuoba tribe The Tuoba were a northern clan of the larger Xianbei ethnic group, which were the dominant people of the Eurasian steppe from the 1st to the 3rd century.7 There exist two views concerning the origin of the Tuoba. The Tuoba people themselves offer an account of their origin that can only be considered legendary. At the beginning of the Weishu, it is written that they are the direct descendants of the Yellow Emperor 黃帝, the legendary ancestor of the Chinese people.8 Although any genealogical link to the mythical heroes has to be legendary, the Tuoba’s purported origin in the Xianbei Hill, located in the northeast of China and the alleged birthplace of most Xianbei people, could be based in fact.9 On the other hand, some ancient historians describe the Tuoba tribe as a hybrid Xiongnu clan from the northwestern steppes. Xiao Zixian, for instance, says that Li Ling 李陵 (?–74 BCE), a great general of the Western Han dynasty, surrendered to the Xiongnu people after a tragic military failure. Thereafter, he settled down in the Xiongnu area and married a Xiongnu woman named “Tuoba.” People referred to their offspring as Tuoba people.10 At the end of the 20th century, scholars found tangible evidence concerning the origin of the Tuoba tribe. Mi Wenpin, a Tuoba specialist, led a search for this proof. In 1980, he led several archaeological expeditions to investigate an ancient cave, Gaxian 嘎仙洞, in the deep forest of the north Greater Khingan Range 大興安嶺.11 According to the Weishu, the early Tuoba people left their original land and migrated south to a lakeside.12 Mi, like many other scholars, suspect that this lake could refer to Hulun Lake 呼倫湖. If this kind of conjecture was true, the Gaxian cave has some relationship to the early Tuoba people since this cave is located only a few hundred miles from Hulun Lake.After several fruitless expeditions, Mi finally found his evidence. On the afternoon of July 29, 1980, the bright sunlight revealed\n\n24 The Northern Wei and Southern dynasties a few vague carved Chinese characters under a moss-covered wall in the cave. With great excitement, scholars quickly removed these thick mosses and discerned 19 lines of caving sentences, written in an antiquated style (Figure 1.2).13 What did these sentences mean? When and why had they appeared in this wilderness? The book Weishu provides us some clues. It states that the early Tuoba people built an ancestral temple in a stone cave near the Xianbei Hill. And, in 443, it is recorded, the Wuluo hou 烏洛侯 people, a small tribe living in the Greater Khingan Range, paid tribute to the Northern Wei and reported that they had found this stone cave in their place. Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei 太武帝(r. 423–452) was quite pleased and sent his confidant, Li Chang 李敞 (mid-5th century), to visit the place. Li indeed went to the cave, verified the message, and conducted the ceremony of ancestral worshipful there. His ceremonial address is recorded in the Weishu.14 As time went by, few scholars noticed this small anecdote. But, during the 1980s expedition, scholars surprisingly found Li Chang’s address carved in Gaxian cave. Both records (in Gaxian cave and in the Weishu) are identical. This discovery, combined with other relevant archaeological findings, proves that the area surrounding the Gaxian cave is the earliest known habitat of the Tuoba people, and it suggests that they indeed originated from far northeast China.15 If the far northeast of China is indeed the birthplace of the Tuoba people, a power vacuum on the steppes could explain why they migrated almost 2,000 kilometers south and finally settled on the northern frontier of the Western Jin dynasty’s territory in the mid-3rd century (Map 1.1).16 According to the historical records, the Xianbei people originally settled near the northern frontier of the Qin dynasty. They were defeated by the Xiongnu people, the first dominant ethnic group in the steppe, and moved to the Greater Khingan Range area in the 1st century BCE.17 One century later, increasing attacks by Eastern Han dynasty forces,\n\nFigure 1.2 Ceremonial Address in Gaxian Cave.\n\nThe Northern Wei and Southern dynasties 25\n\nMap 1.1 Migration of the Tuoba people\n\ncombined with years of natural disasters, forced the Xiongnu empire to flee to what is now Inner Asia, leaving a power vacuum on the steppe. The Xianbei people seized this opportunity and occupied the former Xiongnu lands.18 According to the Weishu, Tuoba Tuiyin 拓跋推寅, the chieftain of the Tuoba people, led the migration towards the south, and they settled around Lake Hulun.19 Two centuries later, another power vacuum on the steppes triggered the second migration of the Tuoba. From the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, China had experienced endless revolts and consequently virtually exhausted its agrarian and military population. To increase its supply of farmers and soldiers, the Eastern Han and subsequent dynasties turned to the “barbarian” frontier groups, which had become compliant. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, large numbers of nomadic people migrated into China to serve as serfs or mercenaries.20 A power vacuum emerged again in the border area, and the Tuoba, along with other steppe peoples, were attracted to move even further south, to the northern border area of the Chinese dynasties’ territory.21 In the late 2nd century CE, the Tuoba people launched their second wave of migration. They traveled southeast and finally arrived at the southern slope of Yin Mountain 陰山, the former heartland of the Xiongnu people.22\n\n26 The Northern Wei and Southern dynasties The Tuoba people lived in the Yin Mountain area for the next three centuries.23 During this period, under several strong chieftains, they evolved from a nomadic tribe into a sedentary state. Tuoba Liwei 拓跋力微 (r. 220–277) was the first chieftain after the second migration. In 258 CE, he successfully formed a tribal confederacy to rule the Yin Mountain area.24 That is why the Western Jin dynasty originally referred to the Tuoba tribe as “a Xianbei tribe led by Liwei” 鮮卑力微.25 In less than two decades, the confederacy collapsed, and Liwei died soon afterward.26 Three decades after his death, in 307, another powerful Tuoba leader, Tuoba Yilu 拓跋猗盧 (r. 307–316), was enthroned. After serving the Western Jin dynasty as a mercenary in battles against non-Han Chinese usurpers, in 310, the Western Jin dynasty granted Yilu the title of “Chanyu” 單於27 and enfeoffed him with the land of Dai 代, a rich agrarian area in northern China, effectively making him Duke of Dai 代公. In 315, Yilu received the title of King of Dai 代王, which entitled him to establish the Kingdom of Dai (315–376).28 However, only one year later, in the midst of disputes concerning his successor, Yilu was killed by his son.29 In 338, another famous Tuoba ruler, Tuoba Shiyijian 拓跋什翼犍 (r. 338– 376), became the king of Dai. Shiyijian seems to have been a formidable strategist. On the one hand, he strengthened Dai’s power by looting other steppe tribes. On the other hand, he gradually abandoned Tuoba’s former steppe politics and built a Chinese-style state with bureaucratic and legal institutions.30 He also built the capital of Dai in Shengle 盛樂 and provided his people with nearly half a century of relative peace. This came to an end in 376, when the Former Qin dynasty 前秦 (351–394), which then ruled over the northern part of China, attacked and conquered Dai. Shiyijian was reportedly killed while attempting to escape (Map 1.2).31 1.2. Rise and fall of the Northern Wei dynasty After defeating the Kingdom of Dai in 376, the Former Qin dynasty divided Dai territory into two parts, which were granted to the Tiefu 鐵弗 tribe and the Dugu 獨孤 tribe.32 Two men from the Tuoba tribe who could potentially create trouble were put under supervision. Tuoba Kuduo 拓拔窟咄 (?–386), the oldest surviving prince of Tuoba Shiyijian, was imprisoned in Chang’an 長安, the capital city of the Former Qin dynasty,33 while the grandson (or son) of Tuoba Shiyijian,34 Tuoba Gui 拓跋珪 (371–409), was guarded by the Dugu tribe.35 In 383, the Former Qin dynasty collapsed almost overnight after suffering a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Eastern Jin dynasty 東晉 (317–420).36 In the ensuing decades, northern China witnessed various states emerging and warring against each other, which was a positive development for the Tuoba people. On February 20, 386, Tuoba Gui declared the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Dai and ascended the throne.37 This is seen as the birth of the\n\nThe Northern Wei and Southern dynasties 27\n\nMap 1.2 Map of state of Former Qin\n\nNorthern Wei dynasty, given that Tuoba Gui, in the next decade, renamed his state, changing it from Dai to Wei. As Klein states, “succession among the early Tuoba was ‘fraternal’, i.e. passed from elder to younger brother.”38 Therefore, in the Tuoba people’s eyes, Tuoba Gui was not a rightful king because the title should have gone to his uncle, Tuoba Kuduo.39 Some Tuoba people even planned a coup to kill Tuoba Gui. As a result, he fled to his mother’s tribe, the Helan 賀蘭.40 Fortunately for him, the Later Yan dynasty 後燕 (384–407), the contemporaneous Xianbei rulers of the northern Yellow River basin (the area on the lower reaches of the Yellow River), offered Tuoba Gui help.41 In the winter of 386, the Later Yan dynasty defeated Tuoba Kuduo and secured Tuoba Gui’s throne.42 Over the following years, Tuoba Gui solidified his rule through a series of military victories. He defeated most of the steppe powers and established his hegemony over the steppes.43 In 391, he challenged the Later Yan’s power by supporting the enemies of that dynasty.44 The Later Yan suffered a bitter defeat at the hands of Tuoba Gui in 395.45 In the following year, Murong Chui 慕容垂 (r. 386–396), the ruler of the Later Yan, led his remaining troops on a revenge mission, but after only a few successes, he grew too sick to continue this campaign and died during the retreat.46 With its military\n\n28 The Northern Wei and Southern dynasties power all but exhausted, the Later Yan could be conquered by Tuoba Gui. To display his ambition, Tuoba Gui chose “Glorious Beginning” (Huangshi 皇始) as the name of his reign in August of 396. In September of that year, he led his troops to the south and occupied the northern central realm, the Later Yan’s territory.47 In early 398, after years of war, he returned to the new capital Pingcheng to build his dynasty, which he named Wei 魏.48 On January 24, 399, Tuoba Gui declared himself “Son of Heaven” (tianzi 天子), a title reserved for the highest rulers in the Chinese tradition.49 In the early 5th century, the Northern Wei focused on consolidating their control over the northern half of what is now China, with no discernible intention to unite the southern half. Chinese administrative methods were gradually adopted, with the result that this fledgling empire was transformed from a nomadic state into a Chinese-style empire.50 The first two Northern Wei dynasty’s emperors did not live long. Tuoba Gui was murdered by one of his sons at the age of 38.51 The next emperor, Tuoba Si 拓跋嗣 (r. 409–423), died of disease at 31 after years of battles against the steppe powers and the Liu Song dynasty 劉宋 (420–479). The third emperor, Tuoba Tao 拓跋燾 (r. 423–452), lived much longer than his forbears. He set about conquering the rest of China in five steps. The first was to regain dominance of the steppes, which he achieved in 429 by defeating the Kingdom of Rouran 柔然 (330–555).52 The second was to unite northwest China by conquering the Kingdom of Xia 夏 (407–431), which he achieved in 430.53 The third step was to conquer the northeast of China, which he achieved in 436 when the Northern Wei defeated the Northern Yan 北燕 (407–436) dynasty.54 The fourth step was to unite the far northwest of China, and the Northern Wei dynasty indeed annexed the Northern Liang 北涼 (401–439) in 439.55 The last step was to conquer southern China and defeat the ruling house of that area, the Liu Song dynasty.56 Tuoba Tao launched an extensive military campaign against the Liu Song dynasty in 450, but his armies were firmly blocked at the Yangzi River. Tuoba Tao reportedly grew increasingly mentally unstable, apparently due to his frustration, and was killed by a eunuch in 452.57 The Northern Wei’s rulers after Tuoba Tao focused on developing their dynasty’s power by introducing various Chinese policies and customs. The famous pioneers of this strategy were Empress Dowager Wenming 文明太后 (442–490) and her grandson Tuoba Hong 拓拔宏, better known as Emperor Xiaowen 孝文帝 (r. 471–499).58 Through their efforts, various Chinese-style political institutions (such as the equal field system, Chinese-style bureaucracy, and legal and financial systems) were introduced, and the civil administration was gradually filled by Chinese officials.59 In 494, this movement reached a peak when Emperor Xiaowen transferred most of the aristocrats, officials, and residents in Pingcheng to the new capital, Luoyang, a city “filled with the resonance of Chinese dynastic power.”60 In the new capital, in the years 494 to 496, Emperor Xiaowen ordered the Tuoba aristocrats to adopt Chinese surnames, speak Chinese, wear Chinese clothes, intermarry with Chinese nobility, and follow Chinese customs and rites.61\n\nThe Northern Wei and Southern dynasties 29 However, an escalating social schism eventually destroyed the Northern Wei dynasty. To defend against steppe invasions, in its early period, it deployed a large number of Tuoba troops in six Garrisons along the frontiers.62 In the late 5th century, the transfer of the capital to Luoyang and the diminishing importance of the border Garrisons caused the Tuoba Garrisons to lose their honored socioeconomic status and privileges, which led to them staging a military uprising in 524.63 The Northern Wei then became embroiled in a full civil war. In the end, Gao Huan 高歡 (496–547) and Yuwen Tai 宇文泰 (507–556), two border generals, wrestled for power, and in 534, they separated the Northern Wei into two courts: The Eastern Wei 東魏 (534–550) and the Western Wei 西魏 (535–557).64 Soon afterward, the former was succeeded by the Northern Qi 北齊 (550–577) dynasty, while the latter was replaced by the Northern Zhou北周 (557–581). The epoch of the Northern Wei dynasty had ended.\n\n2. The Eastern Jin and the Southern dynasties In the three centuries following the collapse of the Western Jin dynasty in 317, the south of China was governed by the Eastern Jin (318–420) and a series of ruling houses collectively referred to as the “Southern Dynasties” 南朝: Song (420–479), Qi 齊 (479–502), Liang 梁 (502–557), and Chen 陳 (557– 588). On the one hand, these Chinese-ruled dynasties sheltered masses of Chinese refugees from the north and warded off waves of attacks by northern “barbarian” powers. Most of them had also competed with the Northern Wei dynasty to become the rightful ruler of the central realm. On the other hand, the Southern Dynasties experienced unceasing internal struggles between powerful cliques and imperial kinsmen, rendering any stable development within their territory impossible. After nearly three centuries, in 589, the south of China was conquered by a successor of the Northern Wei, the Sui dynasty. The histories of the Eastern Jin and the Southern Dynasties are outlined in this section. 2.1. History of the Eastern Jin dynasty In 317, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed after years of uprisings of the northern “barbarians.” In the following year, Sima Rui 司馬睿 (276–323), the King of Langye 琅琊王, ascended the throne of the Jin dynasty in Jianye 建鄴 and initiated the Eastern Jin period.65 The history of the Eastern Jin dynasty can be described as a continuous alternation of dominant noble families. This is because the Eastern Jin emperors had limited power, owing to their dependence on the support of a few noble families who possessed political and military affluence. These families strove to increase their power and usurp the throne thereafter, making the politics of the region increasingly unstable.66 The Wang family of Langye 琅琊王氏 was the first influential noble family. They provided decisive support\n\n30 The Northern Wei and Southern dynasties in establishing the Eastern Jin dynasty and dominated its politics thereafter.67 In 322, Wang Dun 王敦 (266–324), the military leader of the Wang family, as well as the governor of the Jingzhou area 荊州, rebelled and controlled the court for the following two years. However, he died of illness in 324, on the eve of his long-prepared usurpation.68 Thereafter, the Yu family of Yingchuan 潁川庾氏 dominated the court for a short period until the Huan family of Qiaoguo 譙國桓氏 came to the fore.69 Huan Wen 桓溫 (312–373), the leader of the Huan family, undertook three successful military expeditions against western and northern “barbarian” states. These allowed the Eastern Jin dynasty to reoccupy most of the land south of the Yellow River, temporarily, from 356 to 365, and Huan Wen was given the power to dominate the court.70 He died on the eve of his long-prepared usurpation in 373.71 The mounting threats from noble families compelled the Xie family of Chenjun 陳郡謝氏, the subsequent dominant noble family of the Eastern Jin, to form a new national army in 37772: Namely the famous Northern Garrison Army 北府軍, which was stationed near the capital and distinguished itself in the battle against the Former Qin dynasty in 383.73 However, this army soon slid into disarray as various noble families fought each other for control. Huan Xuan 桓玄 (369–404), the new leader of the Huan family and the governor of the Jingzhou area, rebelled in 402. He soon controlled the court since the Northern Garrison Army surrendered to him in order to preserve its power. Huan Xuan forced the emperor to yield the throne and founded the Chu 楚 dynasty (403–405) in 403. However, less than two years later in 405, Liu Yu 劉裕 (363–422), a general of the Northern Garrison Army, defeated Huan Xuan and restored the throne to the Eastern Jin dynasty.74 After putting the Eastern Jin emperor back on the throne, it seems that Liu Yu was intent on founding his own dynasty. According to historiographical sources, he believed that military achievement would increase his authority, enabling him to seize the throne for himself.75 From 405, Liu Yu launched several military campaigns against various northern states and conquered the Southern Yan 南燕 (398–410) and the Later Qin 後秦 (384–417) dynasties, in 410 and 417, respectively. These victories enabled the Eastern Jin dynasty to reoccupy most of China south of the Yellow River, or “four sevenths of All Under Heaven” 七分天下而有其四, as the Liu Song scholar Pei Ziye 裴子野 (469–530) put it.76 Thereafter, Liu Yu left the front line and returned to Jianye to carry out his usurpation. His troops soon collapsed in infighting, leaving most of the newly acquired territories to be reoccupied by the northern states, such as the Xia and the Northern Wei. In 420, Liu Yu finally forced his emperor to abdicate and crowned himself the emperor of Song state 宋, marking the beginning of the Southern Dynasties.77 2.2. History of the Southern dynasties History of the Southern Dynasties was marked by fierce infighting within the royal family. This is because the princes, rather than the noble families\n\nThe Northern Wei and Southern dynasties 31 of the Eastern Jin dynasty, firmly dominated political power throughout the period of the Southern Dynasties.78 Lewis also says that “the southern dynasties maintained their authority by distributing troops throughout the key regions of the empire and placing each regional command under a member of the imperial family.”79 Therefore, the Southern Dynasties fell into disorder due to internal succession crises and were finally replaced by others.80 Emperors Wu 宋武帝 (r. 420–422) and Wen 宋文帝 (r. 424–453) of the Liu Song dynasty are famous for their diligent politics.81 Their reigns can be seen as the most powerful and prosperous periods in the Southern Dynasties era. Emperor Wen undertook several military campaigns against the Northern Wei dynasty, but all of them failed.82 In 450, the Northern Wei dynasty raided the Liu Song dynasty but achieved only a Pyrrhic victory. The great losses suffered by both sides in this battle heralded in a long strategic stalemate.83 Nevertheless, the Liu Song dynasty soon slid into instability. Emperors Xiaowu 宋孝武帝 (r. 453–464) and Ming 宋明帝 (r. 465–472) both ascended to the throne via usurpation and began their reigns by killing the descendants of the former emperors.84 The political situation became increasingly volatile, until Xiao Daocheng 蕭道成 (427–482), a relative of the imperial clan, gradually gained power, crowned himself emperor in 479, and founded the Southern Qi dynasty in 479 (Map 1.3).85\n\nMap 1.3 Map of the early Liu Song dynasty and the Northern Wei\n\n32 The Northern Wei and Southern dynasties As with the Liu Song dynasty, although the first two monarchs of the Southern Qi dynasty, Emperors Gao 齊高帝 (r. 479–482) and Wu 齊武帝 (r. 482–493), allegedly ruled their states diligently, most of their successors were reported to be cruel and prone to usurpation.86 This was the case until Xiao Yan 蕭衍 (464–549), a distant cousin of the imperial clan, came to the fore.87 He rebelled and usurped the throne in 502. His dynasty is known as the Liang dynasty.88 Xiao Yan, or Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty 梁武帝 (r. 502–549), was famous for his support of the arts, literature, and Buddhism.89 His reign lasted nearly half a century, from 502 to 549, and is considered one of the most peaceful and prosperous periods of the Southern Dynasties era. Emperor Wu was said to have become fatuous in his old age. From 427 to 547, the Liang government was forced no less than four times to provide extravagant donations to a Buddhist temple in order to “redeem” their emperor since he had declared himself a monk and abdicated the throne.90 The final stroke came in 548, when Hou Jin 侯景 (503–552), a brutal fugitive general of the Eastern Wei, rebelled. Hou Jin besieged the capital city of Jiankang for nearly a year, causing Emperor Wu to starve to death, and finally captured the city and destroyed it.91 In 549, Hou Jin finally dominated the Liang court, quickly establishing his short-lived dynasty of Han 漢, which lasted only from 551 to 552.92 Next, Xiao Yi 蕭繹 (508–555), the prince of Liang, as well as the governor of the Jingzhou area, came to the fore. He defeated Hou Jin in 552 and ascended the throne in Jiangling 江陵 (the capital of the Jingzhou area).93 In 554, the Western Wei dynasty raided Jiangling and killed Xiao Yi. The Liang general, Chen Baxian 陳霸先 (503–559), restored the Liang dynasty in Jiankang, usurped the throne, and founded the last southern dynasty: Chen.94 The Chen dynasty dominated only the Lower Yangtze Plain, a much smaller area than the other southern dynasties.95 This dynasty was even feebler in terms of military power than the preceding dynasties had been and was finally conquered by the Sui dynasty in 589. The Period of Disunion thus ended.96\n\nNotes 1 Mark Edward Lewis, China between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), 2–4. 2 For the overall bibliography of Chinese study concerning the Tuoba people and the Northern Wei dynasty, see four papers from Ren Aijun 任愛君 and Li Yuexin 李月新, “Jin bainianlai (1900–2008) wuhuan xianbeishi yanjiu suoying 近 百年來 (1900–2008) 烏桓鮮卑史研究索引,” Chifeng xueyuan xuebao赤峰學院學 報 11 (2009): 4–7; 30.12 (2009): 231–237; 31.1 (2010): 216–221; 31.2 (2010): 215–220.
