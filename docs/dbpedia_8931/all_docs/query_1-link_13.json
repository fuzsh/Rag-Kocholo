        "text": "Sep 17, 2017 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Western Wei dynasty Xiwei è¥¿é­ (535-556) ruled over one of the successor states of the Northern Wei empire åé­ (386-534). It belongs to the so-called Northern Dynasties åæ (386~581) and was founded by Yuan Baoju å å¯¶ç¬, son of Prince Yuan Yu å æ of Jingzhao äº¬å ç and grandson of Emperor Xiaowen åé­å­æå¸ (r. 471-499) of the Northern Wei dynasty. The Western Wei empire covered the region of the modern provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, the western part of Henan, as well a the northern part of Hubei. The capital was Chang'an é·å® (modern Xi'an è¥¿å®, Shaanxi).\n\nIn 543 Emperor Xiaowu åé­å­æ­¦å¸ (Yuan Xiu å è©, r. 532-534) fled to the west and submitted himself to the protetion of the powerful warlord Yuwen Tai å®ææ³°, in order to escape the power of the potentate Gao Huan é«æ­¡ who dominated the court at the capital Luoyang æ´é½ (modern Luoyang, Henan). Yet instead of supporting the Emperor Xiaowu, Yuwen Tai killed him and installed Prince Yuan Baoju as emperor of the Wei dynasty (posthumous title Emperor Wen è¥¿é­æå¸, r. 535-551). Gao Huan had meanwhile enthroned another prince, Yuan Shanjian å åè¦ (Emperor Xiaojing æ±é­å­éå¸, r. 534-550), so that the Wei empire was from then on divided into an eastern and a western part, known to historians as the Western and Eastern Wei æ±é­ (534-550) empires. In the west, Yuwen Tai was the factual regent. He proclaimed a series of 24 new rules (Xinzhi æ°å¶), later added by a further set of 36 laws, the so-called Zhongxing yongshi ä¸­èæ°¸å¼ \"The everlasting patterns of the Zhongxing reign\". The main objective of these administrative laws was to prevent corruption or embezzlement, to reduce the number of state offices, the introduction of neighbourhood heads (zhengzhang æ­£é·) responsible for the administration of the local communities, the establishment of agrarian colonies (tuntian å±¯ç°) to promote agriculture, a regular assessment of forthcoming taxes (jizhang è¨å¸³), and the regular use of household registers (huji æ¶ç±). In 641 Su Chuo èç¶½ recommended six measures for the enhancement of the administration of the capital region. Yuwen Tai took over these suggestions and had proclaimed them as the Liutiao zhaoshu å ­æ¢è©æ¸ \"Edict of the six rules\". These rules were to be studies by all persons who wanted to become officials concerned with civilian administration. The six rules were, first, a pure heart (qingxin æ¸ å¿, no corruption), second, honest behaviour with an educational effect (dunjiaohua æ¦æå), third, the effectful use of all arable land (jindili ç¡å°å©), fourth, promotion of competence (zhuo xianxiang æ¢è³¢è¯), fifth, feeling pity in lawsuits (xu yusong å¹çè¨), and sixth, equalizing taxes and corvÃ©e service (jun fuyi åè³¦å½¹). In 551 the system of the eight military \"pillars of state\" (zhuguo æ±å) as given up and the garrison militia (fubing åºå µ) were directly subjected to the control of the central government instead of to generals controlling the regions of the empire. The equal-field system (juntianzhi åç°å¶) invented by the Northern Wei, was continued, yet documents found in Dunhuang æ¦ç  (Xiwei Datong shisannian jizhang è¥¿é­å¤§çµ±åä¸å¹´è¨å¸³) show the available land never sufficed to distribute an appropriate amount of land to the whole population. All able-bodies men had to deliver military service to the government for two months a year, which is quite a hard burder for a peasant population.\n\nNonetheless, the population experienced some relatively peaceful decades under the rule of the Western Wei dynasty. The reform in government were so effective that the Western Wei armies were able to withstand the attacks of the Eastern Wei empire. Emperor Wen was followed by his son Yuan Qin å æ¬½ (known as the Deposed Emperor è¥¿é­å»¢å¸, r. 551-553). During his reign, Western Wei armies under general Yuchi Hui å°é²è¿¥ conquered the territory of modern Sichuan and the city of Jiangling at the banks of the Yangtze River, tracts of land that were until then part of the territory of the Liang empire æ¢ (502-557) in the south. Yuwen Tai soon replaced Yuan Qin by his brother Yuan Kuo å å» (Emperor Gong è¥¿é­æ­å¸, r. 553-556). In the same year as Yuwen Tai died, his son Yuwen Jue å®æè¦º proclaimed himself emperor and founded the Northern Zhou dynasty åå¨ (557-581).\n\nTable 1.
