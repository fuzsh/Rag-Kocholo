        "text": "Located in Henan Province, Luoyang sits on the Yellow River and is surrounded by mountains and plains. It is the cradle of Chinese civilisation, having been the capital city of 13 dynasties from the Xia Dynasty onwards. Chinese culture and religion have a close relationship with the Luoyang, as many Chinese legends such as Nvwa Patching the Sky, are said to have happened here. This is where Taoism originated and also where the governments first Buddhist temple was set up. Many innovations used the world over, such as the seismograph, armillary sphere, paper making, printing and the compass all originated here. Home to the Longmen Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and close to the famous Shaolin Temple, it is one of central China's most popular destinations."
