        "text": "Almost lost in the graveyard of monuments that is the Beijing Art Museum of Stone Carvings is an interesting stele that was first erected during the height of chief eunuch Wei Zhongxian’s career in the reign of the youthful Tianqi emperor. The tablet is a commemoration of a commemoration. It describes the dedication of a shengci (a shrine to a living person) named the Puhui Shengci, in honor of Wei Zhongxian, to commemorate, in turn, his sponsoring the restoration of a complex of horse and camel stables and grazing land to the east of Beijing. According to the tablet, Wei was “promulgating loyalty to the state” when he gave his support to the stable project, which was designed to bring the state several benefits. First, the state would earn rent from tenants who used the facility, although no rent would be charged for the first two years, to encourage herdsmen to move in and establish a livelihood. Second, the state would be able to buy or requisition the animals raised there. Third, the complex was supposed to have an intrinsic military value, as its dikes and ponds were easy to defend and constituted a barrier blocking an eastern advance on the capital. “Thus,” reads the tablet, “was barren land transformed into a marshalling area, not only benefiting the people but also increasing the protection of the northeast.” The Tianqi emperor, in authorizing the project, cautioned only that notices be posted nearby the facility, warning against encroachment by local strongmen and promising capital reprisals for those who ignored the warning.1"
