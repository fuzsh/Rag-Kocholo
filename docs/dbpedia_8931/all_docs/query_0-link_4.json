        "text": "This great cosmopolis, however, dramatically fell into ruins only fifty years after its establishment due to wars, rebellions, and political struggles.\n\nBased on the recent archeological work and historical documents of sixth-century Luoyang, the Digital Luoyang project reconstructs the entire urban landscape of this disappeared city through 3D modeling. In collaboration with pioneering architectural historians and archeologists, the CAMLab team conducted in-depth research on the urban and architectural forms of Luoyang’s major monuments, such as monasteries, pagodas, imperial palaces, ritual architecture, and city gates. Grounded on years of academic efforts, Digital Luoyang created digitalluoyang.com — a virtual world that allows the visitors to traverse a digitally-reconstructed Luoyang by exploring the monuments of this cosmopolitan capital. Also embedded in this virtual experience are educational games and documentary videos, which encourage further explorations of Luoyang’s architectural and urban history."
