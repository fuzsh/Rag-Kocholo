        "text": "Luoyang is a prefecture-level city in Henan province of Central China. The character âLuoâ originated from the cityâs location near the Luo River and âYangâ means north of the river. Luoyang had several names over the centuries, including Luoyi, Luozhou, Dongdu, Xijing and Jingluo. In 25 AD, Luoyang was declared the capital of the Eastern Han Dynasty. For several centuries, it was the political and cultural center of China. The White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple founded in China, is located in Luoyang. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Luoyang was the âWestern Capitalâ and the birthplace of Zhao Kuangyin, the founder of the Song Dynasty. Situated on the central plain of China, Luoyang is one of the cradles of Chinese civilization and housed rich cultural and historic relics.\n\nWe Recommend:"
