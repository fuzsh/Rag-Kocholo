        "text": "Section 7 – The Kingdom of Juli (the ‘Eastern Division’ of the Kushan Empire)\n\n7.1. Juli 車離 [Chü-li]. The character 車 is correctly transcribed as chē, but is pronounced jū in modern Mandarin, I have transcribed the name of this kingdom as Juli. Ju (or che) means a ‘chariot’ or a ‘vehicle.’\n\nThe Hou Hanshu gives Dongli 東離 [Tung-li] for the name of this kingdom. Ju車, in the Weilue therefore, may well be an error for the easily confused character, dong 東 = ‘east’.\n\nThe character li 離 can mean: ‘distant’ or ‘division.’ It seems unlikely that Dongli was intended as a transcription of some foreign name. It translates literally as the ‘Eastern Section’ or ‘Eastern Division;’ from: dong = ‘east’ + li = ‘division.’ Dongli 東離 [Tung-li], therefore = the ‘Eastern Division,’ or ‘The Far East’ (of the Kushan Empire).\n\nI have rendered Juli (= Dongli) as the ‘Eastern Division’ (of the Kushan Empire), as it clearly refers (in both texts) to the Kushans’ newly conquered territories in eastern India.\n\nIn the excellent article by F. W. Thomas: “Sandanes, Nahapāna, Caṣṭana and Kaniṣka : Tung-li P’an-ch’i and Chinese Turkestan,” New Indian Antiquary VII. 1944, pp. 81-100, Thomas also concludes (ibid. pp. 90-92) that the name Dongli was probably not a transcription of a local name but, rather, should be translated as ‘Eastern Division.’ He notes that the second Chinese character in the name, li:\n\n“ancient lyie < lyia (KARLGREN no. 533 [Analytical Dictionary – in his later Grammata Serica, no. 23f – *lia] meaning ‘oriole’, ‘leave,’ ‘quit,’ ‘separated,’ ‘pass through,’ etc., is frequently used in rendering Sanskrit expressions denoting ‘separation,’ ‘lack,’ etc., especially compounds with vi- (including vibhāga, ‘division’), it seems possible that Tung-li is not a transaction, but a translation, meaning ‘Eastern Division,’ in Sanskrit prācya (or pūrva)- vibhāga or prāg-deśa, an expression which by reason of its intelligibility would be specially likely to be rendered by a translation. [Thomas notes here that: “In later times the Chinese uses the expression ‘Tung T‘ien-chu’, ‘Eastern India.’]. Now prāg (or pūrva) -deśa is a regular term for the eastern half of Hindustan, and its popular use, so as to cover the whole country from Magadha in the east to the borders of the Panjāb, appears from the fact that Alexander’s Indian campaign, if continued further east, would have brought him into collision with the Prasioi, the Prācya people, sc. the Magadha empire.” Thomas (1944), p. 91.\n\nConversely, some writers believe Juli 車離 is an attempt to transcribe Kosala, and that Dongli is a mistake for Juli 東離. For example:\n\n“Again the name Kosala may be compared with Ch’ê-li, the main name which the Wei-liao gives for the country. Now, the first character of the latter [sic] ch’ê 車 has two pronunciations, tsai and kio, and using the latter we find that the whole name, pronounced Kiao-lei, could well be a contraction of Kosala. If this is so it would suggest that the Hou-han-shu name Tung-li is also a corruption.” Shiratori (1956b), p. 40.\n\nHowever, I find the argument that ju 車 (K. 74a *ki̯o / ki̯wo; EMC kɨə̆) could be used to transcribe the Kos of Kosala unconvincing.\n\nEitel (1888), p. 68, in discussing “Prācya or the eastern country,” places it to the east of Madhyadeśa (in which Śāketa and the kingdom of Kosala were located). Its western borders did change and, according to some ancient authors, stretched at times almost as far west as Prayāga, which is south of Śāketa. Other ancient authorities place it further east, in the catchment area of the Brahmaputra River.\n\n7.2. This phrase, 車離國一名禮惟特, 一名沛隸王 Juliguo yi ming li wei te, yi ming pei li wang, Chavannes translates as: “Le royaume de Kiu-li est aussi appelé Li-wei-t’o 禮惟特, ou encore P’ei-li-wang 沛隸王;...”. Chavannes (1905): 551.\n\nThe reconstructed transcription of Liwete [Li-wei-t’o] is:\n\nli 禮 K. 597d: *liər / liei; EMC lεj\n\nwei 惟 K. 575n *di̯wer / i̯wi; GR 12144: sgi̯wər / i̯wi; EMC jwi\n\nte 特 K. 961hi * d’ək / d’ək; EMC dək\n\n“According to the account in the Life it was from Kanauj that Yuan-chuang [Xuanzang] went 600 li south-east to Ayudha [阿踰陀 – Ayutuo. W-G: A-yü-t’o]. The capital of this country, which was about a mile [1.6 km] to the south of the river, has been identified with the Ayodhyā of other writers, the old capital of Oudh. On account of difficulties of direction and distance Cunningham proposes a different site for Yuan-chuang’s Ayudha. But it seems better to adhere to Ayodhyā, and to regard Yuan-chuang’s Ganges here as a mistake for a large affluent of the great river. The city was on the south bank of the river, and about 120 miles [193 km] east-south-east from Kanauj. Its name is found written in full A-yü-t’ê-ye (阿喩駃也)[Ayujueye. W-G: A-yü-chüeh-yeh], Ayudhya (Ayodhyā), and the city is said to have been the seat of government of a line of kings more or less mythical. We know also that to the Hindus Ayodhyā was the old capital of Rāma and the Solar race. It is possible that an old or dialectic form of the name was Ayuddha, and the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit word, which suits either form, means invincible or irresistible. Moreover we find that Yuan-chuang makes his Ayudha the temporary residence of Asanga and Vasubandhu, and other authorities represent Ayodhyā as a place of sojourn for these two illustrious brothers. Then the Ayudha of Yuan-chuang is apparently the Sha-ki or Saket, that is Ayodhyā, of Fa-hsien ; this was ten yojanas south-east from the Holi village which was three yojanas south from Kanouj. Alberuni makes Ayodhyā to have been about 150 miles [241 km] south-east from Kanauj, being 25 farsakhs down the Ganges from Bāri, which was 20 farsakhs east from Kanauj. It is the Sākētā or Oudh of the Brihat-sanhitā which merely places it in the “Middle country”.” Watters (1904-05), I, pp. 354-355.\n\n7.3. Peiliwang 沛隸王 [P’ei-li-wang]. This term or phrase is not clear. It could indicate that an alternative name for the kingdom is Peiliwang, as implied by the Chinese sentence construction; or it could mean that the king’s name is Peili (= Pala or Bala)?\n\nPāla in Sanskrit is not necessarily a name, it can also mean, ‘governor,’ ‘guard,’ ‘protector,’ ‘king,’ ‘prince,’ – which raises new possibilities. See Monier-Williams, p. 627.\n\nPei 沛 – K. 501f *p’wâd / p’uâi; EMC phajh\n\nli 隸 – K. 1241m – liei; EMC lεjh\n\nwang 王 – K. 739a *gi̯wang / ji̯wang; EMC wuaŋh\n\n7.4. Tianzhu 天竺 [T’ien-chü] = North(west)ern India. See note 5.15.\n\n7.5. Shaji or Shaqi 沙奇 [Sha-chi or Sha-chih] = Sāketa.\n\nSha 沙 – K. 16a *sa / ṣa; EMC: ʂaɨ / ʂɛː\n\nqi, ji 奇 – K. 1s *g’ia / g’jie̯; EMC: giə̆ / gi, and kiə / ki\n\nzhi 祗 – K. 590p *t̑̑i̯ǝr / tśi; EMC: tɕi\n\nda 大 – K. 317a *d’âd / d’âi, and t’ âd / tâi, and *d’ âr / d’ â; EMC: da’ / dài, and – dah / dajh\n\nThe Chinese form of this name Shaqi 沙奇 is identical in both the accounts of the Hou Hanshu and the Weilue. Fa Xian’s account of c. 405 CE, gives Shazhi 沙祗 [Sha-chih] for the city and, possibly, Shazhida 沙祗大 [Sha-chih-ta] for the name of the kingdom.\n\nThis latter reading would make a fuller and more accurate transcription for Sāketa but, unfortunately, it is impossible to tell whether the last four characters in the sentence, 沙祗大國, should be read: “the kingdom of Shazhida” or “the great kingdom of Shazhi.” The Rabatak Inscription writes: [ζ]αγηδ̣ο = [z]agēḍo for Sāketa – see Sims-Williams (1998), p. 81.\n\nThe Hou Hanshu says:\n\n“The town of Shaqi (Sāketa) is the capital of the kingdom of Dongli東離 (‘the Eastern Division’). It is more than 3,000 li (1,248 km) to the southeast of Tianzhu (Northwestern India). It is a large kingdom.\n\nThe climate and products of the country are similar to those of Tianzhu (Northwestern India). There are several tens of towns of the first rank whose leaders give themselves the title of king. The Da Yuezhi (Kushans) attacked and enslaved it.”\n\nBy modern maps it is about 1,250 km from Sāketa to Taxila, the ancient capital of Gandhāra, which lends credibility to the accounts of both the Hou Hanshu and the Weilue.\n\nFrom this it follows that Dongli was composed of a number of small kingdoms with Sāketa as the administrative centre. It would seem fairly safe to assume that this “Eastern Division” included the cities such as Kausambi, Pataliputra and, probably, Champa, that we now know from the Rabatak inscription, were conquered by Kanishka by the first year of his era (127 CE).\n\nSarnath (near modern Varanasi) should be included in this list, as two inscriptions from year 3 of the same era have been found there. See: Sims-Williams and Joe Cribb (1995/96), p. 83; Sims-Williams (1997), p. 2; Falk (2001), pp. 121-136; Kumar (1973), pp. 42, 245.\n\nThe Sūtrālakāra or Kalpanāmaktikā, ascribed to Aśvaghoṣa, but probably by Kumāralāta, and translated by Kumārajīva in the early fifth century CE, mentions a ‘Dong Tianzhu,’ or ‘Eastern India,’ which must surely refer to the same division or region as Dongli. See: Zürcher (1968), p. 385. Also see: Chavannes (1905), p. 551, n. 1; Chavannes (1907), p. 194, n. 5; and Mukherjee (1968), p. 35. Faxian, in his account of c. 405, says:\n\n“. . . they came to the great kingdom of Shâ-che.” Beal (1885), p. 54.\n\nThis passage could equally well have been translated as beginning: “. . . they came to the kingdom of Shazhida. . . . ” It is not clear whether the character 大 da is part of the name Shazhida (which makes for an excellent and more complete transcription of Sāketa), or whether it relates to the following character, 國 guo, making it read: “they came to the great kingdom of Shâ-che,” as Legge has interpreted it in his translation above. Either interpretation is acceptable.\n\nIn either case, it almost certain they refer to the same town. Both names share the same first character, and 祗 – zhi gives a reconstructed pronunciation of K. 590p *t̑i̯ər / tśi; EMC tɕi – which is close enough to the reconstructed qi in the Weilue’s Shaqi (= K. 1s *g’ia / g’jie̯; EMC: giə̆ / gi). The Chinese name Shaqi 沙奇 [Sha-ch’i] has been identified with Śāketa by Thomas (1944), p. 90:\n\n“Returning to Tung-li (Dongli), we may note with some considerations in favour of an identification with the central region of northern India, madhya-deśa, the ‘mid India’ of Chinese writers. It was a great country, extending over ‘several thousand li’ from north to south and from east to west ; it had dozens of great cities, each with a king ; nevertheless it was a unity having a capital city. This cannot fail to recall to mind the fact that from the time of the Nandas and Mauryas the great central part of Hindustan had continued to constitute an imperial state, which in the period of Aśvaghos̲a and Kaniṣka had two capital cities, namely Śāketa/Ayodhyā and Pāṭaliputra. As regards Śāketa, LÉVI has noted (pp. 90-1) that sometimes the Chinese transcriptions of its name, Sha-chi resemble the Chinese form, Sha-ch’i, of the name of the capital of Tung-li ; but, since one of LÉVI’s Sha-chi forms should in fact be Sha-chi’s [sic – should read Sha-ch’i] (KARLGREN, no. 879), there is rather identity than similarity in the two cases ; and, if it is urged that the Chinese ch’ should represent an Indian g rather than a k, that is no difficulty since the Indian name would naturally have been heard in the Prākrit form Sha(sa) geda, which is the one reproduced in Ptolemy’s Σαγδα [Sagda].”\n\nThere has often been confusion between Ayodhyā and Sāketa, which some writers consider the same, and, others, as separate cities. Ayodhyā is considered by Hindus to be the birthplace of the god Rama and is, therefore, a particularly holy place. A dispute between Muslims and Hindus in recent years (in which Hindus insisted that the famous Babari mosque in modern Ayodhyā was built on the site of the original temple marking the birthplace of Rama) finally led to a violent confrontation which resulted in the destruction of the mosque by orthodox Hindus.\n\nThe destruction of the mosque apparently uncovered a large (5 ft by 2.5 ft) slab of sandstone with an inscription in Sanskrit proving the existence of a Hindu temple (a Vaishnava temple – Vishnu being regarded as an incarnation of Rama) “during the closing years of the eleventh century AD and its reconstruction/renovation sometime about the mid-twelfth century AD.” Shastri, Ajay Mitra. (Date unknown), p. 3.\n\nIt also makes clear that, at this time, the “temple city of Ayodhyā [was] situated in the Saketamandala (district, line 17), showing that Ayodhyā and Saketa were closely connected, Saketa being the district of which Ayodhya was a part.” Lal (Date unknown), p. 4.\n\nThe phrase: qi wang zhi Shaqi zheng 其王治沙奇城, in the Weilue, translates as ‘the seat of the king (of this country – i.e. Juli 車離 or Dongli 東離) is the city of Shaqi.’ Shaqi 沙奇 is undoubtedly a transcription of Sāketa, one of the two capital cities of Kośala (the other being Sāvatthī or Śrāvastī).\n\nThe name 沙奇 Shaqi in the Weilue is very close to the Shazhi(da) 沙祗(大) [Shâ-chih(ta)] that Fa Xian [c. 400 CE] uses for the country of Sāketa (Beal rendered it Sha-che). Shiratori (1956b), p. 40, says:\n\n“Fa-hsien’s 法顯 Fo-kuo-chi 佛國記 puts Shê-wêi 舍衞, the then capital of Kosala, at a distance of eight yojana 由延 from a city called Sha-chih-to 沙祗多. This name, evidently transcribed from the Sanscrit name Sāketa, may be confidently connected with Sha-ch’i, the name given in the Wei-liao to the capital of the country.”\n\nI believe that in the accounts of Faxian and Xuanxang we have proof that Sāketa and Ayodyha were either identical or very close to one another. Faxian, speaking of Shazhi (Sāketa), says:\n\n“As you go out of the city by the southern gate, on the east of the road (is the place) where Buddha, after he had chewed his willow branch, stuck it in the ground, when it forthwith grew up seven cubits, (at which height it remained) neither increasing or diminishing. . . . Here also is the place where the four Buddhas walked and sat, and at which a tope was built that is still existing.” Legge (1886), p. 54.\n\nXuan Zang [Hsüan-tsang], speaking of Ayoutuo(ye) [A-yü-t’o-(yeh)] or Ayodhyā says:\n\n“To the north of the city 40 li (but only 4 or 5 li according to Hui-li - see the next quote), by the side of the river Ganges, is a large sanghârâma in which is a stûpa about 200 feet high [46.2 metres or 152 English feet], which was built by Aśôka-râja. . . . By the side is a stûpa to commemorate the place where are traces of the four past Buddhas, who sat and walked here.” Beal (1884), p. 225.\n\nThe account in the biography by Xuanzang’s companion Huili says:\n\n“North-west of the city [Ayodhyā] four or five li, and by the side of the river Ganges, is a great Sanghârâma, in which is a Stûpa about 200 feet high. This was built by Aśôka râja on the spot where Buddha in old days delivered the Law for three months. By the side of this Stûpa is a spot where the four Buddhas of the past age walked for exercise.” Beal, (1884), p. 85.\n\nIt is clear from the above accounts that Shazhida and Ayodhyā are either identical, or so close to each other as to be considered twin cities. Even if we take the maximum distance given of 40 li between them, this is considerably less than 20 km (no matter which of the various suggested measurements we take for the Tang li). If, on the other hand, we take Huili’s account as more accurate, it is a matter of less than 2½ kilometres.\n\nSāketa is included among the six great cities of early Buddhism in the early Buddhist scriptures of Sri Lanka:\n\n“When this had been said, the venerable Ānanda, spoke to the Bhagavā, saying: ‘Let it not be, Lord, that the Bhagavā should pass away in this mean place, this uncivilised township in the midst of the jungle, a mere outpost of the province! There are great cities, Lord, such as Champā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthi, Sāketa, Kosambi and Banares - let the Bhagavā have his final passing away in one of those! For in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmanas and householders who are devotees of the Tathāgata, and they will render due honour to the remains of the Tathāgata.” From the Mahā-Parinibbāna Sutta translated in: Vajira (1961), p. 68.\n\nThe texts of the Hou Hanshu and the Weilue specifically state that Śāketa was under the control of the Da Yuezhi or Kushans. It is known from the Rabatak Inscription that Śāketa was one of the conquests of Kanishka in the first year of Kanishka’s era, see Sims-Williams & Cribb (1995/6), especially pp. 78 and 83; Sims-Williams (1998), p. 83.\n\nThere is now seemingly convincing new evidence that the Kanishka era began in March circa 127 CE – see Falk (2001), especially p. 130. There are also inscriptions dated in year 2 of this era at both Kosam (ancient Kauśāmbī – to the southwest of Sāketa) and at Sarnath, well to the east of Sāketa. See: Kumar (1973), pp. 244-245.\n\nFinally, if Kanishka’s era started as late as 127 CE, the information on Śāketa and Dongli in the Hou Hanshu and the Weilue must necessarily have been collected some time after Ban Yong’s report to the Emperor c. 125 CE. Mac Dowall (2002), pp. 163-164, states that:\n\n“Fussman reminds us that the Rabatak inscription by itself gives no assurance that Kanishka’s grandfather bore the name of Vima Taktu. The restoration was apparently suggested not by anything visible on the stone itself but by comparison with (a) the Brahmi inscription from the devakula at Mat near Mathura in India and (b) the trilingual inscription in Bactrian, Kharoshthi and an unknown language from Dasht-e Navur near Ghazni in Afghanistan.” Also: “Fussman pointed out that the inscription does not derive from Kanishka himself- the first person is never employed: and it does not date from year one of Kanishka–this is the hypothetical restoration of Sims-Williams whereas the stone is completely effaced at this point. But whatever his name was there was a prince between Kujula and Vima Kadphises.” See also Appendix N.\n\nSims-Williams, however, has never dated the Rabatak Inscription to year one of Kanishka’s era, although, as he said in a recent email: “The Rabatak Inscription is largely concerned with events of the first year of Kanishka.”\n\nI am very pleased and grateful to Professor Sims-Williams for his kind permission to reproduce here the revised second edition of the translation of this remarkable inscription as presented in his article, “Further Notes on the Bactrian Inscription of Rabatak, with an Appendix on the names of Kujula Kadphises and Vima Taktu in Chinese.” See Sims-Williams (1998), pp. 81-90. It is quite clear from this translation that the inscription must have been written some time after the events it mentions. The revised translation of the inscription says:\n\n“. . . . of the great salvation, Kanishka the Kushan, the righteous, the just, the autocrat worthy of divine worship, who has obtained the kingship from Nana and from the gods, who has inaugurated the year one as the gods pleased. And he *issued a Greek *edict (and) then he put it into Aryan. In the year one it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the *whole of the realm of the *kṣatriyas, that (as for) them – both *Wasp, and Sāketa, and Kauśāmbī, and Pāṭaliputra, as far as Śri-Campā – whatever rulers and other powers (they might have), he had submitted (them) to (his) will, and he had submitted all India to (his) will. Then King Kanishka gave orders to Shafar the karalrang *at this . . . to make the sanctuary which is called B . . . ab, in the plain of the (royal) house, for these gods, whose *service here the . . . *glorious Umma leads, (namely:) the above-mentioned Nana and the above-mentioned Umma, Aurmuzd, the Gracious one, Sroshard, Narasa, (and) Mihr. And he gave orders to make images of the same, (namely) of these gods who are written herein, and he gave orders to make (them) for these kings: for King Kujula Kadphises (his) great grandfather, and for King Vima Taktu (his) grandfather, and for King Vima Kadphises (his) father, and for himself, King Kanishka. Then, as the king of kings, the scion of the race of the gods . . . had given orders to do, Shafar the karalrang made this sanctuary. [Then . . . ] the karalrang, and Shafar the karalrang, and Nukunzuk the ashtwalg [performed] the (king’s) command. (As for) *these gods who are written here––may they [keep] the king of kings, Kanishka the Kushan, for ever healthy, fortunate, (and) victorious, and [may] the son of the gods *rule all India from the year one to the year *one thousand. . . . the sanctuary was founded in the year one; then in the *third year [it was] completed . . . according to the king’s command, also many *rites were endowed, also many *attendants were endowed, also many . . . . . . the king gave an *endowment to the gods, and for these . . . *which [were given] to the gods . . .”\n\nI should also mention that Professor Sims-Williams is currently working on a third edition of this inscription “based on examination of the inscription itself rather than just photos.” It is to be expected that his examination of the actual inscription may lead to some changes and/or additions, giving us a better understanding of the inscription.\n\n7.6. This conquest of Sāketa apparently occurred just prior to, or during, 127 CE, as outlined in note 7.5.\n\n7.7. “The people, the men and women are all eighteen chi tall”. This would indicate an unbelievable height of 4.158 metres or 13 feet 9 inches. This is clearly a mistake. The character for 10 appears to have been inserted in front of the account in the parallel text of the Hou Hanshu which says “The men and women there are eight chi tall.” This latter gives the far more credible height of 1.85 metres, or just over 6 English feet. See also: Chavannes (1905), p. 551, n. 2.\n\n7.8. This statement shows that Ju- (or Dong-)li was, therefore, fully subservient, and considered part of the Kushan Empire, not just a tributary state. This is probably also implicit in the name ‘Dongli’ which may be read as the “Far East (of the Kushan Empire).”\n\nSection 8 – The Kingdom of Panyue 盤越 [P’an-yüeh] = The kingdom of Pandya at the southern tip of India.\n\n8.1. The kingdom of Panyue 盤越 [P’an-yüeh] = Pandya – is also called Hanyue wang 漢越王.\n\n“Pandian kingdom. – This was Pāndya, the southernmost, and traditionally the earliest, of the three Tamil states. Roughly it coincided with the modern districts of Tinnevelly and Madurā; at the time of the Periplus it extended beyond [sic] the Ghāts and included Travancore. The capital, originally at Korkai ( the Colchi of § 59, which see ) had been removed to Madurā ( 9o 55’ N., 78o 7’ E. ).\n\nHere too, as in the Chēra kingdom, the name is used for the country and as a dynastic title, not as the name of any king.” Schoff (1912), p. 211. Pelliot discussed the name ‘Hanyue wang’, and the name 磐起 ‘Panqi’, which is used in the Hou Hanshu for this kingdom:\n\n“...but there can be no doubt that the form Panqi is due to a copyist’s error, and it is probably quite late, as the name Panyue was used again in the 7th century when the Tang reorganised the western countries using the names from previous histories in a whimsical manner (Cf. Chavannes, Documents sur les Tou-kiue occidentaux, p. 68). And, on the other hand, Panyue, with the same orthography, is also found in the Liang shu (ch. 54, folio 7 a, of the edition of the Tushujicheng Library).\n\nThe alternation of pan for han in the Weilue is interesting. . . . the alternation of pan and han in transcriptions is established through other examples. . . . ” Translated from Pelliot’s review of Chavannes’ translation of the Weilue. Pelliot (1906), p. 371, n. 2.\n\n“Towards the end of the first millennium BC south India moved from pre-history into history, and literary records reflecting contemporary events are available. Ashoka in his inscriptions refers to the peoples of south India as the Cholas, Cheras, Pandyas and Satiyaputras – the crucible of the culture of Tamilakam – called thus from the predominant language of the Dravidian group at the time, Tamil. The use of the suffix putra in some of these names would suggest a system of clans and chiefs. The first three chiefdoms became almost generic to societies based on clans and lineages in the area and acquired the status of kingdoms in a later period. The Cholas and the Pandyas were located in the eastern area, with a Chola concentration in the lower Kaveri. Korkai and Alagankulam are recently excavated sites, thought to have been exchange centres in Pandyan territory. The first is linked to pearl fisheries and the second developed as a port. Karur on the banks of the Kaveri was an important inland centre, as was Kodumanal, with excavated evidence of working semi-precious stones. Gradually, over time, the Cheras were associated with the western coast. The Satiyaputras, with a more limited history, have been identified through being mentioned in a local inscription in Tamil-nadu.” Thapar (2002), p. 229.\n\n“Muchiri or Muziris, located perhaps in the vicinity of Kodangallur/Cranganore (near Kochi) [recently shown to be at Pattanam, north of Paravoor, on an ancient branch of the Periyar River – see the news items in note 12.12 (5)], was linked to the trade in pepper, spices and beryl. A recently discovered Greek papyrus of the second century AD, documents a contract involving an Alexandrian merchant importer and a financier that concerns cargoes, especially of pepper and spices from Muziris, which provides evidence of the large volume of this trade. References to the rich pepper trade with Malabar continue for centuries, up to the time of the Portuguese. Location of coin hoards suggest a link from Muziris via the Palghat Gap – tapping the beryl mines – and along the Kaveri Valley to the east coast.” Thapar (2002), p. 241.\n\n“The earliest Roman coin [found in the Tamil kingdoms of the southern part of the peninsula] is that of Emperor Augustus 31 b.c. to 14 a.d It is towards the end of the reign of Augustus, contact between the Tamils and the Roman empire, is recorded. Even then trade and contact remained along the West coast, keeping the land and its vicinity and through middlemen. No Roman coin seems to have reached the Tamil land, before the Christian era. In all probability they reached the Tamil Kingdoms in the reign of Tiberius, in whose time there was a great increase in trade. The coins of Tiberius in gold and silver found in the South are quite numerous(18). It is only after the establishment of direct trade between the Roman world and the Tamil Kingdoms, as a result of the discovery of the monsoon by Hippalus, Roman artefacts are found in increasing number in the Tamil soil. Though Romans themselves never seemed to have reached the Tamil Kingdom it is the Greeco [sic – should read “Graeco”] Romans from Egypt who represented them. Hence for the identification of the imported pottery found in Roman context in Tamil Nadu, one has to look to Egypt. The identification of the red slipped ware as the African red ware thus confirms that they were brought by the Egyptian Greeco [sic] Romans.” Nagaswamy (1995), pp. 76-77.\n\n“Roman coins have been found in large numbers in and near Coimbatore. They point: (1) active overland trade between the Malabar coast and the eastern coast at Arikamedu via Coimbatore (Palghat) gap thus avoiding the sea voyage around cape Comorin and (2) to a natural concentration of the trade of the three Tamil Kingdoms in Coimbatore District” Nagaswami (1995), p. 79.\n\n“It should be noted that in the extreme south of the Indian peninsula, the Pandyas played a dominant role in sea trade and even had control over the Sri Lankan trade as well as the pearl fishery. The location of a Roman trading center on the Pandyan coast [Alagankulam -at the mouth of the Vaigai river, southeast of Madurai] is quite understandable from the geopolitical point of view. The mention in Tamil texts of the Pandyan king’s special liking for yavana wine also becomes significant in this context. . . .\n\nThe extreme south of Tamil Nadu was the ancient Pandya-nadu comprising the districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli, and Ramanathapuram. The capital was inland at Madurai and the important ports were Korkai, Tondi and Kumari. Excavations at Alagankulam provide important archaeological evidence for trade between the Mediterranean and Pandyan country. We may also note that some “hoards” of Roman coins have been recovered from different parts of the Pandyan country such as Madurai, Kaliyamputhur, and Karivalamavandanallur. The last mentioned is close to the newly discovered site of Alagankulam.” Raman (1991), pp. 129, 130.\n\n“The classical geographers and the Tamil literature of the ‘Śaṅgam’ age have familiarized historians with the outlines and some of the details of Indian trade with the West in and after the first century A.D. At its prime, the trade was extensive. It included as Indian exports pepper, pearls, gem-stones, muslin, tortoise-shell, ivory and silk; and as imports from the West coral, lead, copper, tin, glass, vases, lamps, wine and, at first, coined money.\n\nBy the latter part of the first century A.D. the literary evidence makes it clear that this trade was organized on lines not unlike those of the European ‘factories’ established in India from the sixteenth century onwards. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. A.D. 60-100) speaks of ὲμπόρια νόμιμα, the unqualified ὲμπόρια of Ptolemy (c. A.D. 150), which may fairly be described as treaty-ports. That is to say, permanent lodges of Western traders were settled in them under formal agreement with the appropriate Indian ruler, and were visited at the proper seasons by convoys of deep-sea merchantmen. And just as the agents of the Portuguese, Dutch, French or British establishments in the days of the Companies travelled widely in the interior to circumvent the middlemen, so we may with probability recognize in some of the Roman coin-hoards far from the sea (fig. 48) the penetration of earlier Western traffickers with similar interest.\n\nOn the scale indicated, this organised interchange implies, a knowledge of the periodicity of the monsoons. Without that knowledge, which, according to Pliny, could restrict the crossing of the Indian Ocean to forty days the laborious coastal voyage to India or the still more precarious overland routes must have prevented the development of regular and direct trade with southern or eastern India. The establishment of permanent agencies in those parts must therefore have post-dated the discovery of the so-called ‘Hippalus’ or north-western monsoon ; a discovery of unknown date but appreciably earlier than Pliny and the Periplus, and possibly, though not certainly, earlier than c. A.D. 21, when Strabo speaks of 120 ships sailing for India from Myos Hormos on the Red Sea. On the other hand, there is no hint that the monsoon was familiar to Mediterranean merchants before the time of the Roman principate. The unification of the western world under Augustus (23 A.D. – A.D. 14) and the recorded reception by him of at least two Indian delegations (c. 25 B.C. and 21 B.C.) provide an obvious context, if not for the actual discovery, at least for its diffusion beyond the corporations of Arab sailors and other agents who had previously monopolized the Indian trade thitherto.\n\nFurther than this the literary evidence fails to carry us. Warmington conjectures from it that the direct route to the Malabar coast, i.e. the full use of the monsoon, was introduced ‘soon after 41‘. Archaeology now indicates a rather earlier date. Some considerable time prior to the abandonment of the manufacture of Italian red-glazed pottery (Arretine and related fabrics) – an event which is unlikely to be later than A.D. 50 – a Roman emporium is now known to have been firmly established far up the eastern coast of India, near Pondicherry. We may infer that at least as early as c. A.D. 30, and possibly before the death of Augustus, regular monsoon-trade had been established between the Mediterranean and western India, with a coastwise or overland extension to the Coromandel coast. Whether at this early date the route was carried to its logical conclusion in Malaya and China is at present unknown.” Wheeler, Ghosh and Deva (1946), pp. 18-19.\n\n“Arabian and Indian traders had doubtless been crossing the Indian Ocean for years, and it is hardly conceivable that they had not learned to use the periodic winds, the chief meteorological phenomenon of this sea. Indeed, some believe that voyages westward were made as early as the seventh century B.C., that they had become common by the time of Nabonidas of Chaldea (556-539 B.C.), when Indian and Chinese ships reached Babylonia, and that this trade continued to flourish without interruption down to Ptolemaic times [“..., see Kennedy in J.R.A.S., 1898, 241-87”]. At any rate, Hippalus’ discovery – whether made in the age of Augustus or, as some think, in that of Claudius (perhaps c. A.D. 45) – at once affected eastbound trade from Rome and Greece, and in this respect he may justly be said to have been quite as great a discoverer as if he had really been\n\nthe first that ever burst\n\nInto that silent sea.\n\nMerchants now spoke of a wind called the hippalus, but no geographer mentioned him as a person, or knew that a mariner of that name had discovered a new route to India.\n\nThe chief depot for pearls was Ceylon. For this reason and because the route up the Nerbudda to Barygaza was hard to navigate and the Gulf of Cutch a little to the north was full of shoals, the successors of Hippalus soon learned to cut across the sea from Syagrus, and later even from Guardafui, to Melizigara on the site of the present fishing village of Jaigarh or to Rajapur farther south, between Bombay and Goa. Still later mariners cut across to the coast of Damarike in the land of the Tamil even farther south, the usual route being to Muziris or Nelcynda below modern Calicut. As we have already noted, the voyage to Muziris from Berenice below Myos Hormos took seventy days [Pliny, 6, 103-4]. The voyage to India from Puteoli, the southern port of Italy, took 112 days, which means the round trip took nearly two thirds of a year. Lucian, the second-century satirist, says that within two Olympiads three return trips of 16 months each could be made from the Pillars of Heracles to India with time off for exploring [Hermotimus, 4].” Hyde (1947), pp. 206-207. See note 12.12(6) for the recent discovery of ancient Muziris, just south of the mouth of the Periyar river mouth in Kerala State, southwestern India.\n\nBefore we turn to the Pondicherry site, the literary picture of these trading-cities may be completed in outline by reference to one or two familiar passages in the Tamil literature. This literature is very insecurely dated, but the relevant passages, which are numerous, may be ascribed on general grounds to the early centuries A.D. . . . And Tamil rajas employed bodyguards of western mercenaries, ‘the valiant-eyed Yavannas whose bodies were strong and of terrible aspect’ and who, equipped with ‘murderous swords’, were ‘excellent guardians of the gates of the fort-walls’. In this capacity they are said to have been employed at Madurā [the inland capital of the Pandyan kingdom]. Yavana craftsmen were also sought after in southern India especially for the manufacture of siege engines. In one way and another, the Yavana in partibus [i.e. in inhospitable or hostile surroundings] enjoyed a considerable prestige whether as trader or as settler.” Wheeler, Ghosh and Deva (1946), pp. 19-20.\n\n“Alagankulam(1), a village about 20 km from Ramanathapuram, near Ramesvaram in Ramanathapuram District of Tamil Nadu, is situated on the banks of the river Vaigai. It is virtually at the mouth of the river about two kilometres inland from the sea. Originally the sea was skirting the village during ancient times but now has receded far. Now a tiny village Arrankarai is situated on the coast that overlooks the Sri Lankan coast. It is claimed that the opposite side could be reached in about 25 minutes by country boats from this village.\n\nThe river Vaigai passes through the city of Madurai, the ancient capital of the Pandyas. It is dry for nearly half of the year and empties itself in a big tank near Ramanathapuram town, and beyond that, the river bed has now dried up totally, only traces of the bed passing through Alagankulam and joining the sea are visible, to show that it ever reached the sea some centuries ago.\n\nHowever, there are copious references in the Sangam Tamil literature to this river since it passed through the Pandyan capital Madurai. The Pandyas were called the rulers of the Vaigai Vaigai Koman, just as the Cholas were called the rulers of the Kaveri. The Sangam work Maduraik kanchi(2), calls it a perennial river (line 356). The commentator Naccinarkkiniyar also confirms it.”\n\n1. Nagaswamy, R., Alagankulam on [sic – should read “an”] Indo-Roman Trading Port.\n\n2. Maduraikkanchi in ‘Patthu Pattu’, Dr. U.V. Swaminatha Iyer, (ed) Madras, line 356.\n\nNagaswamy (1995), p. 70 and nn. 1-2.\n\n”With the discovery of Alagankulum, indicating profuse Roman contacts in the later period, the centre of attraction now shifts to the Pandyan Kingdom. situated on the river Vaigai, the river of the Pandyas, it is tempting to identify the site with Saliyur mentioned in the accounts of the classical geographers. “The far-famed Saliyur (Selur, Salur, Delur in Ptolemy) opposite the north end of Ceylon, was a similar mart overcrowded with ships which had crossed the dangerous ocean and from which costly wares were landed”(24)\n\n24. Warmington, op. cit., p. 62.\n\nNagaswamy (1995), pp. 78-79.\n\nThere are also a number of references in early Tamil literature to the “Yavanas” (Romans or Roman subjects) playing an integral part Tamil Nadu life – not only in trade, but as bodyguards and craftsmen. Some of the references specifically mention the Pandyan Kingdom. For details see: Nagaswamy (1995), pp. 96-102.\n\n8.2. Yibu 益部 [I-pu] translates as ‘Yi Circuit’, also known as 益州 ‘Yi Province.’ The sentence in Section 8 of the Weilue: [盤越] 與益部相近, should be read as “[Panyue] is in contact with Yi Circuit.”\n\nThis phrase has regularly been translated by earlier scholars as “it [meaning Panyue] was near [or nearest] Yibu.” The Chinese text uses the word 與 yu here. This certainly can be used to translate the English word ‘near,’ or ‘to be close to,’ but it can also represent, ‘to associate with’, ‘to make contact with’, ‘to frequent’, ‘an allied country.’ I feel certain that, in this context, it should be read ‘in contact with’ or ‘in communication with.’ See note 15.5 for a detailed discussion of a similarly constructed sentence using this same word 與 yu.\n\nChavannes (1905), p. 552 n. 1, suggests that 益部 Yibu (‘Yi Circuit’) should be read as, 益郡 Yiqun: “the commandery of Yi, during the Han period, which had its centre to the east of the secondary prefecture of 普寧 Puning (Prefecture and Province of Yunnan).” However, I see no need for this. The region (basically the region of present-day southern Yunnan) was commonly known as Yi Circuit during the Han Dynasty.\n\n“By and large, during Later Han, it appears that the terms circuit and province were essentially interchangeable. Strictly, however, a circuit was supervised by an Inspector, while the term province implied that the same region was controlled by a Shepherd (mu, also rendered as Governor), an official of senior rank with effective executive powers. During the reign of Emperor Ch’eng, in 8 B.C., the office of Inspector of a circuit had been changed to Shepherd of a province. The title and functions were restored to their former situation in 5 B.C., under the government of Emperor Ai, but shepherds were again established in 1 B.C., and the office continued in force until the end of Former Han.” Holmgren (1980), p. 55.\n\n8.3. Chavannes (1905), p. 552, translated this passage to read: “Jia Si 賈似, who was a man of the country of Shu 蜀 (Western Sichuan), went there.”\n\nI believe, however, that the sentence: Shurengushu zhiyan 蜀人賈似至焉 [Shu-jen-ku-shu chih-yen], should be read “Traders from Shu (Western Sichuan) travel this far.” I believe the third character 賈, is intended here in its form of gu – a ‘trader’ or ‘merchant’ rather than in its other form, jia – which is frequently used as a personal name.\n\nIf traders were coming to India from Western Sichuan (i.e. from well inland, near the border of Assam and Tibet), they presumably travelled there by one of the several overland routes. For detailed discussions of these routes see Pelliot (1904), pp. 131-413.\n\n“Shu 蜀 (Szechwan) A state of high antiquity traditionally thought to stem from the enfeoffment of a cadet line of the descendants of Ti-kao as Marquis of Shu. Used specifically as an area designation for the part of Szechwan centering on Ch’eng-tu and generally for the whole Szechwan basin.” Rogers (1968), p. 331.\n\nIt is quite likely that things were much the same to the end of the 19th century as there were overland trade routes to India at this time from western Sichuan [Szechwan]. There were certainly routes that a loaded porter or ‘coolie’ could negotiate as recounted by Mesny (1896), pp. 122-123:\n\n“A coolie will carry 200 lbs of brick tea destined for Tibet and the West through the province going at a rate of fifteen or twenty miles a day over terrible mountain passes, with which the reports of various travellers, such as the late lamented Mr. E. C. Baber, have made us acquainted.”\n\nMesny (ibid., p. 141), adds:\n\n“The military jurisdiction of this Viceroy [of Sichuan] extends across Tibet to the very confines of Assam, Nepaul, India, Kashmere and Kashgaria. Chinese garrisons having been established in those remote regions for the past century and a half; the troops being periodically relieved by detachments from the Ssŭ-ch’uan forces. The soldiers in those garrisons are allowed to have Tibetan wives.”\n\n“Finally, if one adds the less commonly used, extremely dangerous overland route through the Chinese province of Sichuan southwards to Burma and East India (an early predecessor of the notorious World War II Burma Road), we have three large arteries for east-west trade, of which the Silk road is the most famous.” Baumer (2000), p. 11.\n\nSection 9 – The Central Route. (Refer to Appendix A for details).\n\n9.1. The kingdom of Weili (or Yuli) 尉梨 [Wei-li or Yü-li] = Korla.\n\nWei or yu 尉 – K. 525a,b: *i̯wəd / jwe̯i; EMC ?ujh, or as yu: ?ut\n\nli 梨 – K. 519h,i: *li̯ər / lji; EMC li.\n\nStein (1921), Vol III, pp. 1230 ff., and (1928), Vol. II, pp. 724, 777 ff, locates Weili at Kara-kum (actually marked Weili, some 40 km south of Korla, on modern maps), and Weixu at Korla itself.\n\nThe Hanshu places Weili 100 li (42 km) south of Yanqi, or Karashahr, and Weixu the same distance away, but no direction is given. Kara-kum is twice as far from Karashahr as the Hanshu indicates Weili and Weixu are.\n\nBy modern road, it is about 47 km southwest from Yanqi (Karashahr) to Korla. The small difference of 5 km from the measurement of the Hanshu between Yanqi and Weili can be explained by changes in the route, or the town centres since the Han period.\n\nKorla has long been the largest centre in the region after Karashahr itself, having abundant water and extensive farmlands, and control of the main routes to the south and west of Karashahr. Weili is given a population of 9,600 compared to only 4,900 for Weixu in the Hanshu, which also mentions that it adjoins Shanshan and Qiemo (Charchan) to the south.\n\nThe Hanshu states it is 300 li (125 km) west from Weili (Korla) and 350 li (146 km) east of Kucha to the seat of the Protector General at Wulei. Measured either west from Korla or east from Kucha this brings one to the oasis of Yangisar [or Yanghi-hissār].\n\nBecause Stein was not aware of the true length of the Han li (he thought it to be about 1/5 of a mile, or 322 metres, instead of the true length of about 416 metres), he was unable to properly choose between the three oases of Bugur, Yanghi-hissār, and Chādir, as the site of modern Wulei. See Stein (1928). Vol. II, p. 794. He favoured the Bugur oasis as the probable site because it is the largest oasis between Korla and Kucha (ibid. 796). However, he also gave Yanghi-hissār serious consideration and noted its strategic importance:\n\n“The importance of Yanghi-hissār is increased by the fact that a route leads from it across the high range northward of the Yulduz plateau at the head of the Kara-shahr valley. It was stated to be the first practicable route east of Kuchā to the plateau, and to be much used by Mongols taking supplies from the oasis to their grazing grounds. The pass crossing the watershed was said to retain snow all through the year ; but these hardy Mongol customers, I was told, find it practicable even during the winter months.” (Ibid. 791).\n\n“Wei-li 尉犂, GSR 55b and 519g : *iwcd/*jwei - licr/liei or li̯cr/lji. The 19th and 20th century Han shu commentators locate it around Bugur. Chavannes (1905), p. 552, note 5, and (1906), p. 234, note 2 locates Wei-li – and Wei-hsü . . . [see note 9.2] – in the vicinity of Lake Bagrash or Bostang nor. He criticizes Wylie for following the Hsi-yü t’ung-wen chih 西域同文志 of 1766, and consequently locating Wei-li at Kalgan-aman, close to and NE of Korla. Huang Wen-pi (1958), pp. 6-7, suggests that the extensive ruins NE of Korla and South of Ssu-shih li ch’eng 四十里城 (marked on his “additional map 5” at c. 86° 28’ E and 41° 55’ N) might still be the capital of Wei-li, containing a Han settlement. Shimazaki (1969), p. 44, still places Wei-li at Kalgan-aman.” CICA: 177, n. 585.\n\n“The prosperous town of Korla lies on the Baghrach Kol, a large lake, through which the Kaidu river pursues its course. The water of the lake is of fabulous transparency, and enlivened by endless numbers of large fish, most of them belonging apparently to the barbel family. There are, however, shad as well – ugly creatures as long as a man and with enormous mouths.\n\nHerr Bartus, as an old sailor, could not resist throwing his line in here. . . . He had flung into the water a pound of meat on a gigantic hook and strong line, and an antediluvian monster had swallowed the bait. With great effort he dragged it out of the water, to the intense delight of the entire population, who were watching the visitors’ doings. It weighed about fifty pounds, had a smooth skin – brown spotted with white – and was something like our eel-pout. In spite of my warning – for some of the fish here are dangerous eating – Herr Bartus persisted in having some of it for dinner and found it excellent. . . .\n\nThere are only two districts in the whole country where fish are often eaten, viz. round about Maralbashi, where the River Tarim brings down enormous quantities, which are enjoyed by the Dolans living there ; and, secondly, in the neighbourhood of Lake Lop-nor, where the whole population, apparently differing in many respects from the other Turks, live chiefly on fish, either fresh or dried. It is remarkable that both the Dolans and the dwellers round Lop-nor are looked upon as people of another race by the Turks.\n\nThe lake at Korla is the playground, too, of innumerable flocks of water-birds, and is the breeding-place of swans, whose plumage is in much demand by the Chinese as an edging for valuable robes. Geese and ducks of different kinds frequent the shores and surface of water in great quantities, and we always saw numbers flying in their hook-shaped flocks across the sky. Herons of every kind are also to be found there, but we could never inspect them closely as they always took to timid flight at the approach of men on horseback.” von Le Coq (1928), pp. 109-110.\n\nPut together, I think this evidence confirms the identification of Weili as Korla, and Yangisar [Yanghi-hissār] as the seat of the Protector General during the Former Han.\n\n9.2. The kingdom of Weixu 危須 [Wei-hsü] = Hoxud = Chokkur.\n\nStein (1921), Vol III, pp. 1230 ff.; and (1928), Vol. II, pp. 777 ff) places Weixu 危須 at Korla. However, the Hanshu states that Weixu is 200 li (83 km) farther from the seat of the Protector General at Wulei 烏壘 than Weili (500 li instead of 300), and places it 100 li (42 km) from Yanqi (Karashahr). One must, therefore, assume it is further east than Karashahr, on the route to Turfan.\n\nThis identification is supported by the Shuijingju [Shui-ching chu] which indicates that the Yulduz river used to have a northern branch, flowing into the northwest of Lake Bostang, to the west of Weixu. This old course of the river is now indicated by the network of irrigation channels, to the west of the present town of Hoxud, that service this region, the water being used up before it can flow into the lake.\n\n“Wei-hsü 危須, GSR 29a and 133a : ngwia/ngwie̯ - si̯u/si̯u. The Shui-ching chu 2.30ff., says that the Tun-hung river’s ... eastern tributary flows southeast and then divides into two [although the present-day Yulduz River (= Tun-hung) apparently does not bifurcate]; coming from Yen-ch’i (i.e. Karashahr), it is led West of Wei-hsü and then flows southeast to end in the Tun-hung Marsh. . . . The latter is identified with Bostang Lake or Bagrash Kul and the former with the Hai-tu or Yulduz. Hsü Sung locates Wei-hsü to the Southeast of Bostang Lake; Chavannes (1905), p. 552, note 6, seems to accept this localization, criticizing Wylie for following the Hsi-yü t’ung-wen chih (see note 585 above) and placing Wei-hsü at Chagan-tungi, Northeast of Karashahr.” CICA, p. 177, n. 587.\n\nThese descriptions and the distance, (travelling east from the seat of the Protector General at Wulei) 100 li (42 km) past Yanqi (Karashahr), makes it very probable that Weixu was located somewhere closer to the present town of Hoxud.\n\n9.3. The kingdom of Shanwang 山王國 [in the western Kuruk mountains]. This placename could just as well be translated as “the kingdom of the King of the Mountains.”\n\nChavannes (1905), p. 552, n. 7, points out that this kingdom is undoubtedly the same as the kingdom of Shan 山國 in the Hanshu and the kingdom of Moshan 墨山國 [‘(Black) Ink Mountain’] in the Shuijing. He says that it must have been located between Lake ‘Bagrach’ (‘Bagrax’, ‘Bostang’, or ‘Bosten Hu’) and Lop Nor and that Grenard’s proposal to locate it at Kyzyl sanghyr, 130 km southeast of Korla is “very plausible.”\n\nThe 6th century Shuijing places Weili, which I identified as Korla, 240 li (100 km) to the west of Moshan [ ‘(Black) Ink Mountain’]. See Stein (1928) Vol. II, p. 724.\n\nThe Hanshu places the kingdom of Shan only 160 li (67 km) southeast of Yanqi (Karashahr) so it must be located near the extreme western end of the Kuruk-tāgh, although its exact position remains to be determined.\n\nStein (1921) Vol. I, p. 334, says it “can only roughly be located in the Western Kuruk-tāgh,” although he does consider the possibility that it might have been located at Singer (= Kyzyl sanghyr); but this is much further than 67 km to the southeast of Karashahr. See also: ibid., p. 420; CICA, pp. 85, n. 85, and 182, n. 615.\n\n9.4. The kingdom of Yanqi 焉耆 [Yen-ch’i] = Karashahr.\n\nYanqi 焉耆 [Yen-ch’i] has long been confidently identified with the region of modern Karashahr. The Buddhist Sanskrit name was Agni-. For detailed discussions of the derivation of the name and its likely associations, see Bailey (1985), pp. 1-2; 137-138, and Pulleyblank (1963), pp. 99; 123. During the time of the Moghuls it was called Chálish (Jálish) – see, for example, Elias (1895), pp. 99, 100, 102, 122 of the Introduction.\n\n“The whole of this district round Kara-shahr and Korla is, from a geographical and political point of view, both interesting and important ; for whilst all other parts of Chinese Turkestan can only be reached either by climbing high and difficult passes – the lowest of which has the same elevation as Mont Blanc – or traversing extensive and dangerous waterless deserts of sand-hills, here we find the one and only convenient approach to the land through the valleys of several rivers in the neighbourhood of Ili, where plentiful water abounds in the mountain streams on all sides, and where a rich vegetation makes life possible for wandering tribes. Such Kalmuck tribes still come from the north-west to Tal. They are Torgut nomads who pitch their yurts round about Kara-shahr and live a hard life with their herds. . . .\n\nJust as these Mongols wander about here at the present day, so the nomadic tribes of an earlier period must have used this district as their entrance and exit gate. The Tochari (Yue-chi), on their way from China, undoubtedly at that time passed through this gate to get into the Ili valley. . . . ” von Le Coq (1928), pp. 145-146.\n\nThe Hanshu mentions that Yanqi (Karashahr) “adjoins Wu-sun on the north.” CICA, p. 177, n. 588, p. 178. This was of particular concern to the Chinese as Stein makes plain in the following passage:\n\n“These observations on the present conditions of Kara-shahr will make it clear that, while the territory has been favoured by nature in various ways, its geographical position must at all times have exposed it to a very serious drawback. I mean its close vicinity to, and its easy access from, mountain tracts which, as far back as history takes us, have always had a particular attraction for nomads. It is unnecessary here to explain in detail how the famous grazing uplands of Yulduz have been cherished haunts for all the great nomad nations, from the Wu-sun and Huns downwards, which held sway along the T’ien-shan, that natural spina, as it were, in the cycle of Central-Asian migrations. Situated as Kara-shahr is at the very mouth of the big valley leading down from Yulduz, it must have been like a gate specially inviting those who had their favourite summer camps on those grassy plateaus and necessarily looked to the oases on the south as their richest grounds for raids and exactions. Whenever Chinese power was firmly established from Turfan to Kashgar or beyond, the gate might be kept safely closed. The same is likely to have been possible during periods while internal feuds or conflict with nomad aggressors weakened the tribes in the north. But the danger must always have been close at hand, and from time to time Kara-shahr was bound to suffer from its onset. The oases further west would then be exposed, too, to plunder and heavy exactions of tribute. But the additional risk of prolonged occupation would be reserved for Kara-shahr, which alone could offer grazing grounds adequate for the maintenance of large nomad hosts.” Stein (1921), p. 1180.\n\n“Some distance before the town of Yanqi, soda-whitened marshes, tall grasses and grazing cattle indicate the proximity of the vast Baghrash Lake. Though today Yanqi is only the country seat of the Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, where one of the main industries is the making of reed screens for fencing and roofing, historically it was the very important oasis of Kara-shahr (Black Town), which in AD 11 revolted against Han domination by murdering the Chinese protector-general. The revolt was ruthlessly stamped out by the Han-Dynasty general Ban Chao, who sacked the town, decapitating 5,000 inhabitants and carrying away 15,000 captives and 300,000 head of livestock.” Bonavia (1988), p. 147.\n\n“On MARCH 26 we passed along the northern outskirts of the Korla Oasis, and turned northeast following the courses of the Konche darya. The trail led over a plain of piedmont gravel, gradually rising toward the mountains. . . .\n\nThe road entered a narrow river gorge. Not far from the entrance stood a Chinese outpost and we had to produce our permits to travel to Karashahr. For some reason the Torgut region was carefully watched by the Chinese.\n\nWe camped on the banks of the river not far from a grove of trees. The air was wonderfully cool and refreshing, and we rested from the dusty atmosphere of the desert. In the early morning we broke camp and started for Karashahr, still some twenty miles distant. Not far from our camp, the Konche darya turned its course eastward and our route crossed a low hill and then descended into the basin of the Lake Baghrash. The road lay over a sandy tract covered by tamarisk shrubs. . . .\n\nWe passed by the village of Shorchuck, in the vicinity of which are situated important ruins, explored by German and British expeditions. After five hours’ ride, we reached the Karashahr darya and had to spend a considerable time waiting for rafts to come from the other bank of the river.” Roerich (1931), p. 102.\n\n“Yen-ch’i 焉耆, GSR 200a and 5521 : *ian/*iän or gian/jiän - g’i̯ɛr/g’ji, traditionally identified with Karashahr. Huang Wen-pi (1958), p. 7, suggests that “the old walled town of Ha-la-mu-teng” 哈拉木登, a few li South of the modern settlement of that name and North of the Haidu River might have been the administrative centre of Yen-ch’i; the site is located on Huang’s map nr. 2 at c. 86o 5’ E and 42° 16’ N. – For different ancient misspellings of this name see Chavannes (1905), p. 564, note 2. Wang Ching-ju (1944), p. 91, believes that in Han-times Yen-ch’i was pronounced *ārgi, leading to a later *arśi; it is to be noted that the Αoρσoι mentioned by Strabo are usually identified with the people of Yen-ts’ai. . . . ” CICA: 177, n. 588.\n\n9.5. The kingdom of Gumo 姑墨 [near modern Aksu].\n\nGu 姑 – K. 49g: *ko/kuo; EMC: kɔ\n\nmo 墨 – K.904c: *mək/mək; EMC: mək\n\nAlthough many writers assume that the largest centre of the ancient kingdom of Gumo is identical with modern Aksu, I suggest that, while it may have included the site of Aksu, its seat of power was considerably to the south.\n\nThe main town of the kingdom of Gumo in the Hanshu is called Nancheng 南城 ‘Southern City,’ which, by its very name, suggests it was located near the southern end of the region watered by the Aksu River. CICA, p. 162 and n. 498. The exact site is yet to be located, but Nancheng was likely in the strategic region of modern Wuxuntamu or Aral, approx 40o 26’ N, 80o 51’ E, more than 100 km southeast of modern Aksu, near the junctions of the Khotan and Aksu rivers with the Kashgar River.\n\nFrom here, one had many choices of routes across the desert. One could follow the Kashgar river west to Kashgar, or the branch tributary, the Yarkand River to Yarkand. Alternatively, one could follow the Khotan River due south to Khotan, or the main Tarim River east to Loulan and Lop Nor.\n\nGrenard was the first to say that the earlier identification of Wensu with ancient Aksu was wrong, and showed that Aksu was represented in the Han period by Gumo. Chavannes (1905), p. 553, n. 1, has outlined strong evidence in favour of the latter identification which is backed up by Stein’s observations (1921) Vol. III, pp. 1297-1298.\n\nThe Hanshu says that Gumo was 670 li (279 km) west of Kucha (the modern road is 262 km) and 1,021 li (425 km) from the seat of the Protector General stationed at Wulei 烏壘 = Yengisar (see CWR note 20.10). It adjoined the Wusun to the north, and was 15 days by horseback south to Khotan. CICA, p. 162, and n. 497.\n\nStein (1921), p. 1299, notes that it was a “seven-miles [11.3 km] ride from the ‘New’ to the ‘Old Town’ of Ak-su. . . . ” Given that we still don’t know the exact positions of the Han settlements at either Kucha or Aksu, the distance of 273 km along the road from modern Kucha to ‘Old Aksu’ is remarkably close to the distance of 279 km given in the Hanshu.\n\n“The area is frequently visited by light dust storms generating an eery, creeping ‘fog’ around the base of the sand mounds and the occasional ruins of the Han-Dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) beacon towers.\n\nNeolithic artefacts from 5000 BC have been discovered in the Aksu area. By the first century BC news had reached the Chinese imperial court of the Kingdom of Baluka, one of the 36 kingdoms of the Western Regions. The kingdom, aided by the Xiongnu, held out against the Chinese army under General Ban Chao for a time, only to have him march upon the capital city in AD 78 and execute 700 inhabitants.” Bonavia (1988), p. 160. The Hanshu – see CICA, p. 162 – says that Gumo produced copper, iron and orpiment.\n\n“The 262 kilometre (162 mile) journey from Kucha to Aksu [by bus] takes between five and six hours. The area is frequently visited by light dust storms generating an eery, creeping ‘fog’ around the base of the sand mounds and the occasional ruins of the Han-Dynasty (206 BC–AD 220) beacon towers.” Bonavia (1988), p. 160.\n\n9.6. The kingdom of Wensu 溫宿 [Wen-su] = modern Uqturpan or Wushi 烏什.\n\nwen 溫 – K. 426c *·wən / ·uən; EMC ?wən\n\nsu 宿 – K. 1029a *si̯ôk / si̯uk; EMC suwk\n\nThe Hanshu (CICA, p. 163) places Wensu at an impossible 2,380 li (990 km) from the seat of the Protector General at Wulei (Yengisar), which was only 350 li (146 km) east of Kucha.\n\nHowever, it states that it was 270 li (112 km) west of Aksu (Kumo), 610 li (254 km) south of 赤谷 Chigu, the capital of the Wusun near lake Issik-kol, and 300 li (125 km) east of 尉頭 Weitou.\n\nThese indications place it firmly near modern Uqturpan (= Uch-Turfan) or Wushi 烏什, in the valley of the Toxkan (or Toshigan) River, further up the Aksu River from the Kingdom of Aksu or Gumo.\n\nIt must be emphasized that several earlier writers confused Uqturpan with modern Wensu, which is written with the same characters as ancient Wensu. Modern Wensu is less than 20 kilometres northwest of Aksu whereas, ancient Wensu was about 90 km to the west, on the site of modern Uqturpan or Wushi 烏什. See: Chavannes (1905), p. 553, n. 1; 1906: 224, n. 3); Stein (1921) Vol. III, pp. 1299-1301; Pelliot (1959), p. 492; CICA, p. 162, n. 502.\n\nAncient Wensu controlled access up the Toshigan valley and also the approach to the Bedel Pass, the main route north to Issik-kul. Stein (1921) Vol. III, pp. 1300-1301, remarks:\n\n“The usual dust haze of the spring was hiding the view of the great snowy range of the T’ien-shan northward. It was thus impossible to obtain even a distant glimpse of the Bedel Pass, by which Hsüan Tsang had once gained the Issik-kul region and thence Sogdiana. But even without that imposing background Uch-Turfān presented itself to me as the most picturesque and pleasant of any district headquarters I had visited in Chinese Turkestān. The view of the fertile green valley, set off vividly by the chain of barren grey hills which encircle the town from the south, was particularly striking from the height of the Chinese citadel. . . . This crowns the top of a precipitous rocky spur, which adjoins the west wall of the town and projects beyond it like a huge natural ravelin, rising with its westernmost cliffs to a height of some 250 feet. The citadel and the flanking defences joining it to the town walls are recent, having been built in the place of fortifications destroyed when Uch-Turfān was besieged and taken during the Muhammadan rebellion. But this natural stronghold is bound to have been utilized since early times.\n\n. . . . the ‘kingdom’ and town are referred to [as Wen-su] in the Former Han Annals, the Hou Han shu, and the Wei lio. The former Han Annals ascribe to it a population of 2,200 families, which seems proportionate, and indicate its position quite correctly with reference to the Wu-sun capital which lay 610 li to the north, to Ku-mo, or Ak-su, and to Wei-t’ou 尉頭, 300 li westwards. . . . ”\n\n9.7. The kingdom of Weitou 尉頭 [Wei-t’ou] = modern Karaqi, to the west of Akqi.\n\nWeitou is located in the Han shu (CICA: 163), as being 300 li (125 km) west of Wensu or Uqturpan [Uch-Turfan]. The only place it could possibly be, assuming the distance of 125 km west of Uqturpan is correct, is the small community called Karaqi or Ha-la-ch’i.\n\nThe Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World, Tenth Edition, 1999, places Karaqi at 40o 44’ N; 77o 59’ E, while the U.S. Defence Mapping Agency Aerospace Center ONC, 1:1,000,000 map (Sheet F6, Edition 5, revised 1981) places Ha-la-ch’i at 40o 50’ N; 77o 55’ E.\n\nKaraqi controls a key fork in the routes of the region, the main summer route from Aksu to Kashgar heads southwest from here, while another route leads almost due west towards Ferghana. Its importance undoubtedly derives from its strategic position.\n\nMost previous writers have mostly located it at Safyr Bai or Akqi, but both of these places are far too close to Wensu to explain the statement in the Hanshu that it was 300 li (125 km) to the west of that place.\n\n“[Wei-t’ou] is mentioned by the Later Han Annals as on the road leading from Su-lê or Kāshgar north-eastwards to Wên-su, Ku-mo, and Kuchā, and may be located with much probability about Akche on the upper Tushkan-daryā (map No. 14. A. 2). This place is passed by the much-frequented summer route between Ak-su and Kāshgar, and the adjoining area shows now a good deal of Kirghiz cultivation.” Stein (1921), Vol. III, p. 1301.\n\n“The distance of about 70 miles [113 km*] between Uch-Turfān and Akche agrees well with the 300 li indicated by the Former Han Annals between Wên-su and Wei-t’ou. Safar-bai, which M. Grenard, Mission Dutreuil de Rhins, ii. p. 61, has suggested for the name of the latter place, is too near; see Map No. 14. c. 2. It is worth noting that Akche is the first place with agricultural resources which the traveller by this route reaches after leaving the Kashgār district.” Ibid., p. 1301, n. 26. *Note that with the most careful measurements on Stein’s own maps, I cannot get any distance further than 63 miles or 101 km between Uch-Turfān and Akche.\n\n“Wei-t’ou 尉頭, GSR 525b and 118e : *•i̭wəd / *•ὶjwḙi - d’u/d’ə̭u; [Note: Karlgren’s reconstructions here are incorrectly given in CICA] Wang Hsien-ch’ien identifies it with Wu-shih County, at approx. 41° N, 79° E. Chavannes (1905), p. 554, note 1, refers to Grenard, Mission scientifique en Haute Asie II, p. 61, who localizes Wei-t’ou at Safyr bay, Southwest of Uch Turfan.” CICA, p. 142, n. 374.\n\n9.8. Qiuci 龜玆 [Ch’iu-tz’u] is universally accepted as referring to the Kucha oasis. See note 4.16.\n\n9.9. Zhenzhong 楨中 [Chen-chung] = Arach (near Maralbashi). Not much is known of this place during Han times – there is no mention of it in the Hanshu, and no major entry in the Hou Hanshu. It appears to have been close to Kashgar.\n\nThe first brief reference to this “kingdom” seems to be in the biography of Ban Chao, under the name of Sunzhong 損中 [Sun-chung]. Zhong 忠 [Chung], a king of Kashgar who had been unseated and replaced by Ban Chao with the help of Kangju and the Kushans, returned and established himself here in 86 or 87 CE. He tried to make an alliance with Kucha, but Ban Chao tricked him to a meeting, and had him beheaded. Chavannes (1906), pp. 230-231.\n\nThe next reference to Zhenzhong 禎中 [Chen-chung] (note the slightly different initial character) dates to 169 CE in the Cefuyuangui [Ts’e fu yüan kuei] (chap. 973, p. 8b):\n\n“The Prefect of Liangzhou, Meng Tuo, ordered the Congshi Ren She to take five hundred soldiers from Dunhuang (Shazhou) and, with the Wuji Marshall (Wu-chi Szu-ma) Cao Kuan and the Chief Administrator of the Western Regions (Xiyu Zhangshi) Zheng Yan who was at the head of more than thirty thousand men from Yanqi (Karashahr), Qiuci (Kucha) and the Anterior and Posterior tribes of Jushi (Turfan and Jimasa) to go to attack Sule (Kashgar). They attacked the town of Zhenzhong for more than ten days without being able to subdue it. Then they withdrew.” Translated from Chavannes (1905), p. 554, n. 2.\n\nZhenzhong 禎中 (or Sunzhong 損中) was obviously a very well-fortified site to withstand such a substantial siege. We have scant information except that, as it was attacked by troops from Karashahr, Kucha, Turfan and Jimasa, who were en route to conquer Kashgar, it was probably some distance to the east of Kashgar, guarding the main route via Aqsu. That it was mainly a defensive position, rather than a thriving oasis town, is probably the reason it is not included in Han itineraries.\n\nThe most likely place is Arach (39o 58’ N; 78o 40’ E) on the “Old road to Tumshuk,” where Stein found remains of a ruined fort and watchtowers controlling the only viable pass though the Achal-tāgh range. This would have controlled the main routes from the northeast to both Kashgar and Yarkand:\n\n“Having thus traced the ancient road from Ak-su as far as the Lāl-tāgh site, there still remains for us to consider the line of its probable continuation to the south-west. Such a line had necessarily to cross the chain of hills represented by the Bēl-tāgh and its southern extension, the Achal-tāgh or Ōkur-mazār-tāgh ; and the map shows that only two passages were available for it. One is represented by the gap in the Bēl-tāgh above described ; the other leads through the defile that separates the southern end of the Bēl-tāgh from the northern offshoot of the Achal-tāgh formed by the low rocky spur of Arach. I had visited this defile on my first rapid reconnaissance from Marāl-bāshi in May, 1908. I ascertained on that occasion that the high road from Tumshuk to Marāl-bāshi had in quite modern times, until after the Chinese reconquest of the Tārīm basin in 1877, passed through it, the present line past the Ōkur-mazār being then impracticable owing to great undrained marshes in the area now occupied by the lands of Chār-bāgh. I had been able to trace there the remains of old watch-towers and of other fortifications meant to guard the defile, and their presence left no doubt that an important road must have passed there in ancient times.\n\nI had not time then to examine the desert ground to the east of the defile, and this was an additional reason for now returning to Marāl-bāshi by this passage, appropriately known as Achal, ‘the opening’. I found no reason to regret the decision. We passed numerous lines of dead Toghraks with shallow dry channels between them for the first two miles from the Lāl-tāgh site, clearly showing by their direction that running water must have reached this part from the south, i.e. from the area west of Tumshuk still liable to inundations from the Kāshgar-dārya. Then, after crossing a belt of tamarisk-cones, we emerged upon a bare clay steppe undergoing wind-erosion, and here for more than a mile came across frequent patches of ground covered with ancient potsherds and other ‘Tati’ remains. In the midst of them we crossed the unmistakable embankment of an old canal about 12 feet across at its top and owing to erosion of the surrounding land raised some 5 feet above the present ground level.” Stein (1928), pp. 77-78 and map MARAL-BĀSHI, Serial No. 8. See also: Stein (1921), III, pp. 1311-1312, and map 15.\n\n“At the small town of Sanchakou, 214 kilometres (133 miles) southwest of Aksu, is a turnoff for Bachu, called Maralbashi [also known as Tumschuk] in the records of the 19th- and 20th-century European explorers. Sir Aurel Stein traced the walls of a fort and the structures of an extensive city, both long abandoned. A direct desert route along the Yarkand River linked it with Yarkand (Shache), a journey accomplished by Stein in five days.” Bonavia (1988), pp. 162-163.\n\n“In view of the old remains traced at and near the gap of Achal, it is, I think, safe to assume that the ancient route passed on from Lāl-tāgh to this defile, as did the modern route via Tumshuk until some forty years ago. But beyond it, topographical facts, combined with such archaeological indications as I have discussed above in connexion with my journey from Kāshgar, point to a bifurcation. On the one hand it is on general grounds highly probable that there was a south-western continuation of the ancient route to the present Marāl-bāshi ; for though the present town is of avowedly modern origin, and probably the surrounding oasis also, yet a look at the map shows that the branch of the road which forms the easiest and most direct connexion between Ak-su and Yarkand must always have passed the site in question. Whether there existed any large settlement during ancient times corresponding to the present Marāl-bāshi is doubtful, seeing that the detailed accounts of the ‘Western kingdoms’ contained in the Han and T’ang Annals make no mention of a special territory or tract at this place.” Stein (1928), p. 80.\n\n“The distance from Faizabad [the last settlement of the Kashgar Oasis] to Maral-bashi was covered in four stages. The road ran through a sandy country covered by jungle, said to abound in game. In the past this must have been a huge forest area, but nowadays the jungle is retreating to the north and the sands are rapidly encroaching on the forest. The road was made difficult by numerous dry tree stumps and roots completely buried under the sand. . . .\n\nOn March 3, we entered the large and important Oasis of Maral-bashi, connected by two important routes with Kashgar and Yarkend. The oasis itself is not large but it is well irrigated and has an abundant supply of subsoil water and several lakes. The Yarkend darya approaches it from the south. To the northwest and north rise low, rocky ridges – southern offshoots of the outward T’ien Shan. . . .\n\nOur next stop was Ak-tumshuk or simply Tumshuk. On leaving the cultivation zone of Maral-bashi and Char-bagh Bazaar, a small hamlet some fifteen miles northeast of Maral-bashi, we emerged on a vast sandy plain covered by shrubs. The stage was a very long one, about thirty miles, and we reached the village of Tumshuk at about eleven o’clock at night. Not far from the village stands a Chinese inscription dating back to the time of the reconquest of the New Dominion in 1877. North and southeast of Tumshuk lie important ruins. The ancient sites were excavated by the eminent French sinologist, Professor Paul Pelliot, during his expedition in 1906-8.\n\nFrom Tumshuk it took us four long stages to reach Aksu. . . .” Roerich (1931), pp. 95-96.\n\n9.10. The kingdom of Suoju 莎車 [So-chü] = Yarkand.\n\nSuo 莎 – K. 16f: *swâ / suâ; EMC: swa.\n\nOR Sha – K. 16f: *sa / ṣa; EMC: ʂaɨ / ʂɛː\n\nju 車 – K. 74a: + *ḳi̯o / ki̯wo; EMC: kɨǝ̆\n\nOR che – *ẗ’i̯å / ẗś’ia; EMC: tɕhia\n\nThere has never been any question that the Suoju (or Suoche) 莎車 [So-chü or So-ch’e] of the Han period is to be identified with modern Yarkand or Suoche (also written Shache). Pelliot (1963), pp. 876-885, discusses the identification of Yarkand in detail and, as he notes in an earlier work:\n\n“All scholars, both Chinese and European, agree that the kingdom of So-chü of Han times must be identified with Yarkand.” Pelliot (1959), p. 879.\n\n“For this city Ptolemaios’s text has four variants σοÃτα, σοÃγα, σότα, σάγα. Here the fourth is nearest to the Saka word. The modern, half-Turk name is Yār-kand. The Turkish yăr is ‘cleft’ and ‘rock’ as in yar tuzï ‘rock salt’. The Turkish has kept the meaning of the original name and added the word kand ‘city’. Here yar is from yarmaq ‘to split’.” Bailey (1958), p. 73.\n\n“Yarkend impressed us as being a much more active and thriving place than Khotan. It is the chief entrpôt of Indian and Afghan trade and its roofed bazaars and chaikhaneh or restaurants were thronged by different nationalities. Yarkend is the largest oasis in the country. It is well watered by irrigation channels and has an extensive cultivation of rice, which is exported to Khotan and Kashgar. Besides rice, the oasis produces corn, wheat, barley, cotton, flax, hemp, sesamum, and tobacco. According to recent official estimates, the population of the oasis is over 200,000. The Mohammedan town or Kone-shahr is surrounded by a brick wall with several towers. The Han-ch’eng or Chinese section lies to the northwest of the native quarter. The Afghan Government maintains a consul at Yarkend who, although not recognized by the Chinese as such, supervises the Afghan colony and its interests in the oasis. The most costly products of Afghan export are opium and Badakhshani horses. The trade is clandestine and the offenders are usually punished. For the past few years the export of Badakhshani horses has been prohibited by the Amir, and Afghan traders, travelling to Chinese Turkestan or elsewhere, have to sign a document that they will return to the country with their horses. Notwithstanding these strict measures, Badakhshani horses are constantly seen on the Yarkend market, the horse trade being carried on through Kirghiz traders.\n\nMost of the Yarkand trade is conducted with India and the Indian colony is the largest foreign colony in the oasis. . . .” Roerich (1931), pp. 86-87.\n\nAlso see: Stein (1907), p. 88; CICA, p. 139, n. 361; Bailey (1985), p. 73; Bailey (1958), p. 133; Daffinà (1982), pp. 325-326.\n\n9.11. The kingdom of Jieshi 竭石 [Chieh-shih]. Possibly one of the smaller towns in the Kashgar oasis. Stein (1907), p. 15, believed it may have represented an early attempt to render the name Kāshkār in the Kashgar oasis, and in Chitral (also known as Kāshkār), where we find an identical, or very similar, name:\n\n“The open and fertile part of the main valley, containing the large villages which bear collectively the name of Chitrāl and form the political centre of the Kāshkār or Chitrāl State, answers remarkably well to the description given in the T’ang Annals of the mild climate and rich produce of Chieh (Chieh-shih). And in view of the topographical arguments already adduced for its identification, we need not hesitate to suggest also that it was the local name Kāshkār, or an earlier form of it, which the Chinese endeavoured to reproduce by Chieh-shih or Chieh-shuai. The application of the term Kāshkār to the territory of Chitrāl is well attested from Muhammadan sources, and its use is still current throughout those regions. Chieh-shih, as an attempt to represent Kāshkār by Chinese sounds, would have a parallel in the name Ch’ia-sha which Hsüan-tsang gives to the present city and oasis of Kāshgar, in Chinese Turkestān.” Stein (1907), p. 15.\n\n“Chavannes (1906), p. 554, note 3, believed that the place name Chieh-shih 竭石, GSR 313r and 795a : g’i̯at/g’i̯ät - d̑‘ǎi̯k/z’i̯äk in the Wei-lüeh should be compared to the T’ang names 佉沙 ki̯wo-ṣa and 迦帥, Karlgren (1923), no. 342 and GSR 559a : ka-ṣi, both indicating Kashgar; the Wei-lüeh term would then provide the necessary authority to identify Kashgar with Ptolemy’s κασια χώρα. Pulleyblank (1963), p. 219. . . reconstructing an “Old Chinese” pronunciation *sa̲ĥ-gleats, believes this to be an early form of transcribing Soghd, to be identified with Kesh.” CICA: 130, n. 320.\n\n9.12. The kingdom of 渠沙 Qusha [Ch’ü-sha]. Literally ‘Big Sands’ or ‘Spacious Sands’.\n\n“Qusha 渠沙 appears identical to Qusuo 渠莎 [also pronounced Qusha] that the Pei shi (chap. XCVII, p. 3 b) mentions as occupying the ancient town of Suoju莎車 (Yarkand). Qusha or Qusuo was therefore not a principality distinct from Yarkand.” Translated from Chavannes (1905), p. 554, n. 4.\n\n“But a much earlier source [than the Weishu or the Peishi], the Wei-lio, which was written in the second quarter of the 3rd cent., mentions in succession “the kingdom of So-chü (Yārkänd), the kingdom of 碣石 Chieh-shih (*G’i̯ät-źi̯äk; perhaps read 竭石Chieh-shih, *G’i̯ät-źi̯äk, and cf. CHAVANNES, Doc. sur les Tou-kiue, 69), the kingdom of 渠沙 Ch’ü-sha (*G’i̯wo-a), the kingdom of 西夜 Hsi-yeh, ...” (cf. CHAVANNES, in TP, 1905, 554). The Hou-Han shu (118, 4 a) has a notice on “the kingdom of Hsi-yeh, also called 漂沙 P’iao-sha” (*Pi̯äu-a; CHAVANNES, misled by a misprint in the T’u-shu-chi-ch’êng Shanghai edition, gives 虜沙 Lu-sha in TP, 1907, 174; but all the ancient editions have P’iao-sha, adopted in DE GROOT Chin. Urkunden, II, 79). The Hou-Han shu owes much to the Wei lio, and I hold it for certain that its P’iao-sha is merely a copyist’s error for the Ch’ü-sha of the Wei lio. It is no less clear that the Ch’ü-sha of the Wei lio and the Ch’ü-so of the Pei shih also represent one and the same name. In all likelihood, Ch’ü-sha, indirectly supported by P’iao-sha of the Hou-Han shu, is the correct form, and sha was altered to so in the Pei shih under the influence of the following So-chü. But even the identification of Ch’ü-sha = Ch’ü-so with So-chü = Yarkand is unreliable, since both the Wei lio and the Hou-Han shu (this with the corrupt form P’iao-sha) agree in mentioning Ch’ü-sha quite apart from So-chü (Yarkand). The wrong identifications of ancient names in this chapter of the Pei shih are numerous.” Pelliot (1963), p. 880.\n\nMy own suggestion is that Qusha referred to a settlement on the main route between Yarkand and Khotan, possibly in the region of modern Kizil Bazaar, two stages towards Khotan from Yarkand, and a notoriously sandy region. Aurel Stein (1912), pp. 138-139 reports finds of ancient Uighur manuscripts and the remains of ancient dwellings and a part of a leather slipper in this region, although he was unable to provide chronological evidence for the finds.\n\n“Next day we were in Kizil Bazaar – a half-ruined village with a vast desert plain called Karakum or “Black Sands.” The next stage to Yangi-hissar lay across a desert country intersected by hamlets with small patches of cultivation.” Roerich (1931), PP. 87-88.\n\n9.13. The kingdom of Xiye 西夜 [Hsi-yeh] = Karghalik.\n\nChavannes (1903), p. 397, n. 4, (1905), p. 554, n. 5, and (1907), p. n. 3, identified this kingdom with modern Yularik, south of Yarkand. However, the directions given in the Hanshu and the population figures given in the Hou Hanshu make it almost certain that it refers to modern Karghalik, as Aurel Stein first pointed out:\n\n“. . . we are necessarily led to identify Hsi-yeh as Karghalik ; for only on the assumption that this great oasis is meant can we account for the striking difference in population which the notice of the Later Han Annals indicates by stating the number of households as 2,500 at Hsi-yeh and only 350 at Tzu-ho. The proportion is about the same as a modern census would be likely to reveal between the oasis of Karghalik proper and the Beg-ship comprising Kök-yar, Yül-arik and Ushak-bashi. The identification of Hsi-yeh with Karghalik is in striking agreement with the statement in the Ch’ien Han shu that Hsi-yeh joined P’i-shan on the east and So-ch’ê on the north ; for Guma and Yarkand are the neighbours on these sides exactly as here represented.” Stein (1921a), pp. 86-87.\n\nMy only qualification to Stein’s analysis is that he locates Zihe [Tzu-ho] too close to Kharghalik, partly due to his under-estimation of the Han li (at about 322 metres instead of the true 415.8 metres).\n\nBut, even using his figures, the text would place Zihe 322 km from Kashgar – a figure impossible to reconcile with him situating Zihe not far south of Karghalik, around Kokyar (which is only about 50 km south of Karghalik), and the tiny oasis of Yularik, about 10 km further east. Kokyar lies on the winter route (zamistani) between Yarkand and the Karakoram Pass. See: von Le Coq (1928), p. 153.\n\nThe text states that Zihe was in a gorge, some 1,000 li, (about 416 km from Kashgar) – which makes it almost exactly at modern Shahidulla (or Xaidulla = Pinyin: Saitula). Shahidulla is a strategically important centre on the way to the Sanju and Karakoram Passes on the main route south to Ladakh. This shortcut to India via Ladakh was in regular use until the Chinese closed the borders soon after the Communist victory in 1949.\n\nThe main obstacle on the route was the high and dangerous Karakoram Pass (5,575 m or 18,291 ft). Caravans would often rest and graze their animals in the fertile valley near Shahidulla until conditions were favourable to cross the less rigorous Sanju Pass, also called the “Suget Pass’ (5,364 m or 17,598 ft), and then the notorious Karakoram.\n\nShahidulla controlled the route to the north of the Sanju Pass from where one could head northwest to Pishan and Yarkand or northeast towards Khotan. Although the Suget is a difficult pass, it is possible to take laden yaks across it:\n\n“On the 5th of November, after passing through the gorge of the Karakash River, at the foot of the walls of the fortlet of Shaidullah, built by the Kashmiraians and long since abandoned by them, we came at Toghrusu, into the midst of the gay tumult of a Kirghiz wedding. . . .\n\nOn the 7th, we left the Karakash Daria, the valley of which is impracticable in the downward direction, and began to ascend the gorge of one of its affluents which runs down from the Sanju Pass. Imagine an exceedingly narrow gorge, whimsically tortuous, deeply confined within tall peaked rocks, bare and strangely hewn and slashed and the whole gorge obstructed by flint rubbish. On reaching the end of this gorge, we found ourselves as though at the bottom of a well. With the assistance of some Kirghiz oxen, we scaled one of the walls of the well and thus reached the summit of the Sanju Pass, which is at a height of 16,800 feet. From there, according as one turns to the north or the south, the view offers a striking contrast. In the south is a monstrous chaos of gigantic snow mountains and dazzling glaciers, which the rays of the sun sometimes cause to look like great blue lakes slumbering amid a polar whiteness ; in the north, a few brown hills, beyond which stretches something like a vast ocean wrapped in a shroud of grey mist : this is the Kashgarian plain and its atmosphere laden with dust.\n\nThe ascent of the pass was not easy, but the descent was worse. The slope is so steep that, in a league of horizontal projection, one descends 1,880 metres and, for a distance of 800 metres, the slope, at 45 degrees, is covered with a thick layer of ice. The yaks are really wonderful animals which, descending a mountain like this, carry over two hundred pounds on their backs without stumbling. Our horses, although carrying no burden, did three-fourths of the road in some other way than on their feet : one of them slipped so badly that it was hurled to the bottom of the valley and broke its spine. . . .\n\nFrom the foot of the pass, one follows a deep, grassy valley, here and there meeting the round tents of Kirghiz herdsmen. Little by little, the mountains grow lower, the valley wider, the grass disappears, the sand shows itself and one sees, between two dusky hills, the trees of the oasis of Sanju. Here there are some thousand houses, scattered on every side, and a considerable amount of ground under cultivation ; and it is easy for the traveller to procure all that he wants provided that his wants are modest.” Grenard (1904), pp. 28-30.\n\nNotes on Sanju Pass adapted from Merzliakova (2003):\n\n“The Pass leads to Shahidula. The uplift starts in the valley of Chibra.” “The uplift is not steep, but the terrain is rocky without any vegetation, covered with snow in some places. It is practicable for laden animals. The way down the Pass is steep into the deep and narrow valley. . . . The ancient Lekh [sic] trade route lead over the Pass toward Kargalyk between India and China through Karakorum, Chuchu-Dawan, Sasser. . . .”\n\nShahidulla also controlled access to a lesser-known route which headed west, eventually passing by a settlement called Mazar and then through the Shimshal Valley and over the Shimshal Pass into the upper Hunza Valley or into Wakhan. This provided an alternative to the route through Tashkurghan to northern Hunza or Wakhan, and would have been shorter and more convenient for travellers coming from the east or south.\n\nNotes on the Shimshal Pass adapted from Merzliakova (2003):\n\n“Height: 4735 m [or 15,535 ft]. [From another source]: 4420 m [or 14,501 ft]. “The route is not very difficult, it is practicable for ponies, but goes along the precipice in 800 m over the river. . . . The Pass is not under permanent snow. In winter the route to the Pass goes along the river Khunza, but in summer there is no road at all, because it is flooded. According to Younghusband the Pass is used in summer. [At present]:\"There is an overgrazed high pasture around the Pass. The women of Shimshal graze here about 1000 yaks and 3000 sheeps and goats in July and August. . . . . There is a collection of shepherds huts in one mile from summit. There are also two small lakes.”\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century this route was closed as it became the base for a band of notorious robbers who preyed on the caravans travelling between India and the Tarim Basin via the Karakoram Pass. See the chapter on “The Raiders’ Stronghold,” in Younghusband (1924), pp. 127-141.\n\nAnother piece of supporting evidence that Zihe was in the region of modern Shahidulla – the Hanshu remarks that “the soil of Tzu-ho produces jade-stone.” CICA, p. 101.\n\nIn 1868, Robert Shaw, a British trader based in India, set out on a journey from Ladakh to Yarkand. On his way, not far from Shahidulla, on the upper courses of the Karakash river, he passed a group of stone huts:\n\n“We found out afterwards that this valley had formerly been frequented by the Chinese, who obtained jade from hence. This industry is now extinct, as the Mussulmans of Toorkistân have no taste for ornaments of this stone. A line in the Chinese ‘Thousand Character Classic,’ enumerating various productions, says, “Jade comes from the Kuen-lun Mountains” (which are those in question). I am indebted to Mr. Aston, of the India Museum, for this quotation.” Shaw (1871), p. 98, n. 1.\n\n“To the west of Khotan was the small kingdom of Cu-gon-pan or Karghalik,3 which was important as the usual starting-point for intercourse with the western Himalaya, India, and the Pamir countries, via Sarikkol or Tashkurghan, and later by the Karakoram passes. The high mountain valleys south of the main watershed which led to these passes were, no doubt, dependent upon Cu-gon-pan rather than Khotan, so long as it existed as a separate entity ; but it is to be suspected that this kingdom was in general overshadowed by Khotan, though clearly it would derive support from its relations to its northern neighbours Yarkand and Kashgar.”\n\n3 [Chavannes, Documents], pp. 124-5; Stein, Ancient Khotan, pp. 91-3.\n\nThomas (1935-1963) Part I, p. 150.\n\n9.14. The kingdom of Yinai 依耐 [I-nai]. I have been unable to locate this tiny community with any confidence. Undoubtedly it was close to Tashkurgan as Chavannes (1905), p. 555, n. 1, notes.\n\n“ ..., and it [Yinai] is distant by 10150 li [4,597 km] from Ch’ang-an. There are 125 households, 670 individuals with 350 persons able to bear arms. To the north-east it is a distance of 2730 li [1,136 km] to the seat of the protector general. It is a distance of 540 li [225 km] to So-chü [Yarkand] and 540 li [225 km] to Wu-lei; to the north it is a distance of 650 li [270 km] to Shu-lo [Kashgar]. To the south it adjoins Tzu-ho and the way of life of the two places is similar. There are few cereals and the state hopes to obtain [the produce of] cultivated fields from Shu-lo [Kashgar] or So-chü [Yarkand].” CICA, p. 102.\n\n“I-nai 依耐, GSR 550f and 982h : *i̯ər/*jc̯i nəg/nậi. – I-nai is supposed to have been situated in the same area as P’u-li, see note 180.” CICA, p. 102, n. 182.\n\n“The exact location of P’u-li and I-nai, the other small territories which Chu-chü-po or Karghalik had absorbed in T’ang times, cannot be determined at present. But the mention made in the Chien Han shu of their position north of Tzŭ-ho, and of their dependence on So-ch’ê or Yarkand for agricultural produce, suggests that they may represent the isolated hill settlements found in those little accessible valleys like Asghan-sal, Öch-b’ldir, Tong, which are drained by the middle course of the Zarafshān, or Yārkand, River. . . . ” Stein (1921), Vol. 1, p. 87.\n\n9.15. The kingdom of 滿犁 Manli [Man-li] = Tashkurghan. Chavannes made the point that this place is identical with the 蒲犂 Puli of the Hanshu:\n\n“In place of Manli 滿犂 (the second character being written 犁 in the edition of the Sanguozhi said to be by Bao Rentang), the Qian Hanshu (chap. XCVI, a, p. 4 b) gives the reading 蒲犂 Puli; in place of 億若 Yiruo, the Hou Hanshu (chap. CXVIII, p. 4 a) gives the reading 得若 Deruo. – The three kingdoms of Yinai, Puli and Deruo should be in the region of Tashkurgan; cf. BEFEO, III, p. 397, n. 4.” Translated from Chavannes (1905), p. 555, n. 1.\n\n“The Tashkurghan kingdom of Sarikkol adjoined Cu-gon-pan [Karghalik] on its own eastern side, while more northwards it was connected by direct routes with Kashgar : its rulers were more in relation with the latter. On the west the Sarikkol kingdom extended up to the Wakhan Pamir, where its neighbour may be designated by the general term Tokharestan.4”\n\n4 [Chavannes, Documents], p. 155.\n\nThomas (1935-1963) Part I, p. 150 and n. 4.\n\n“P’u-li 蒲犂, GSR 102n and 519g : b’wo / b’uo - liər / liei. – Wang Hsien-ch’ien refers to the Shui-ching chu 2.12a which says that the Southern River, after having flowed eastward through P’u-li, descends northward to the country of P’i-shan; he then quotes the Shui-ching t’u-shuo ... which says : “The waters that flow separately between Yengihishar and Yarkand from here on flow eastward to unite with the Yarkand at Yarkand.” CICA, p. 101, n. 180.\n\n“The seat of the king’s government is at the valley of P’u-li, and it is distant by 9550 li [3,973 km] from Ch’ang-an. There are 650 households, 5000 individuals with 200 persons able to bear arms. To the northeast it is a distance of 540 li [225 km] to So-chü [Yarkand] and to the north of 550 li [229 km] to Shu-lo [Kashgar]. To the south it adjoins Hsi-yeh and Tzu-ho, and to the west it is a distance of 540 li [225 km] to Wu-lei. [There are the following officials] : a noble and a commandant. The state hopes to obtain [the produce of] cultivated fields from So-chü [Yarkand]. Its race and way of life are similar to those of Tzu-ho.” CICA, pp. 101-102.\n\nThe identification of Manli/Puli with modern Tashkurghan appears certain. The directions in the Hanshu provide accurate directions and distances from both Suoju or Yarkand – 540 li or 225 km to the east – and Shule or Kashgar – 550 li or 229 km north. These distances are very accurate when checked on modern maps. There is no other settlement on these routes or in this region that it could be.\n\nThe dependence on food supplies from Yarkand (referred to in the Hanshu) and the size of the population (about 5,000) have not changed since the time of the Former Han, thus providing additional confirmation of its identification. See CICA, pp. 101-102. There is only one piece of evidence that does not fit. In the Hanshu’s description of Suoju [Yarkand], it is said that Puli is 740 li (308 km) to the southwest (CICA, p. 140). This must be a simple copyist’s error for the 540 li listed in the section on Puli (CICA. p. 101 – see above).\n\nHeading south from Tashkurgan the traveller in ancient times had two main choices. The first route (and the only one practicable for laden pack animals, led over the Neza Tash Pass and southwest through the Ak Tash (‘White Stone’) Valley along the Aksu or Oksu (‘White Water’) River – which here flows to the northeast – until one entered the Wakhan Valley proper. The second route, through Hunza and Gilgit was not passable for beasts of burden.\n\n“Our first day’s journey [from Tashkurgan] was to the foot of the Neza Tash pass, sixteen miles [26 km] in a south-westerly direction up the Shindan stream, which flows through the defile of the same name and falls into the Sirikol river. The defile at several places is extremely narrow, and shut in by precipitous rocks and bold steep hills which rise high above it. The fallen stones and stream boulders make the road particularly bad for many miles. Willows and thorn bushes grow plentifully at the head of the defile, and the hills there lose their bold character, and become rounded and sloping. Our camp was in snow, but large patches of grass free from it were found in the vicinity sufficient for our horses, which ate it greedily, preferring it greatly to the chopped straw we carried for mixing with their grain. This grass was similar to what we found in many parts of the Pamirs, and in the Aktash valley, rich and sweet to the smell, resembling English meadow hay, and relished immensely by our animals. Judging from what we saw of it in the end of winter, it is easy to believe in its fattening properties in summer, as related by Marco Polo and other travellers, and also told us by the Wakhis. Neza Tash, meaning spear-stone, is named from a spear-like pointed rock near the place.\n\nOn the second day we crossed the Neza Tash pass (14,920 feet)[4,548 m], leading over a high range running about north-west, and encamped at the mouth of the ravine leading down from it to the Aktash valley, travelling a distance of seventeen miles [27 km] in a general westerly direction. Snow fell in the night time, and our journey for this and the following three days, covering a total distance of seventy-eight miles [126 km], was made mainly through snow. We found plenty of grass in scattered patches and brushwood fuel at this day’s camping place. We were here joined by a party of Sirikolis with yaks and ponies carrying supplies sent by Hussan Shah to accompany us to Wakhan.” Gordon (1876), pp. 123-124.\n\nNotes on the Neza Tash Pass adapted from Merzalikova (2003):\n\n“Height: 4328 m [14,199 ft]. The Pass leads down Karasu stream to valley Aksu in “Sarez Pamir.” “On the west side it is very easy to ascent. Descent more difficult steep and stony.” From there one travelled past the Little Pamir Lake roughly 80 km to Langar:\n\n“…twenty-five miles [40 km] from the lake. A deserted village and traces of cultivation were observed here, and numerous yaks and cattle were seen grazing on the opposite side of the valley. A stream of considerable size also joins at Langar, flowing from the south-east, and a road goes by it to Kunjut, over the Kura pass.” Gordon (1876), p. 129.\n\nWhen one reached Sarhad (literally, ‘frontier’), approximately another 40 km west from Langar, one could cross south over the relatively easy Baroghil Pass (3,798 m; 12,460 ft) towards Mastuj which leads to either the Chitral Valley. From here there was relatively easy access to both the region around modern Jalalabad in Afghanistan, with somewhat more difficulty, through Swat to the region of ancient Gandhāra near Peshawar.\n\nIf, on the other hand, one headed due west from Sarhad through the Wakhan Valley, one travelled through Badakshān to Bactra (Balkh) and beyond.\n\nThe quickest route into northern India, usually open all year, was extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot. From Tashkurgan one travelled just over 70 km south to the junction of the Minteke River. Heading west up this valley one reached the Kilik and Mintaka Passes which both led into upper Hunza from which one could travel over the infamous “hanging passages” to Gilgit and on, either to Kashmir, or to the Gandhāran plains.\n\n9.16. The kingdom of Yire (or Yiruo) 億若 [I-je or -jo] = Mazar, also known as Tágh Nák and Tokanak.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the same small kingdom, Dere (or Deruo) 德若 [Te-je or –jo] that is mentioned in the Hou Hanshu (note the very similar first characters) – see Chavannes (1905), p. 555, n. 1.\n\n億 yi; K. 957e: *i̯ək; EMC ?ik\n\n德 de; K. 919k: *tək; EMC tək\n\n若 re or ruo.; K. 777a: *ńi̯ak; EMC: ɲia’, also ɲɨak (commonly used to transcribe the Sanskrit sounds of: j, ya, and jña.)\n\nThe reconstructed Chinese pronunciations above show a remarkably close resemblance to the name Tágh Nák used twelve centuries later in the Tarikh-i-Rashidi, which was completed in 1547 CE.\n\n“The Kingdom of Dere controls more than 100 households, 670 individuals, and 350 men able to bear arms. On the east, it is 3,530 li (1,468 km) to the residence of the Chief Scribe [at Lukchun]. It is 12,150 li (5,052 km) from Luoyang. It borders on Zihe (Shahidulla), and their customs are the same.” Hou Hanshu Chap. 118 (TWR, Section 7).\n\nFor some years I had suspected that the site of the tiny ‘kingdom’ of Dere mentioned in the text of the Hou Hanshu after Zihe (which I had confidently identified as Shahidulla – see note 7.13) was in the region of the hamlet marked Mazar [Ma-cha] on modern maps (approx. 77o 0’E, 36o 26’N – about 90 km west of Shahidulla).\n\nThe reasons for my identification of Dere with Mazar includes the fact that Mazar, like Shahidu"
