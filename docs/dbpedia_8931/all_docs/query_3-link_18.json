        "text": "LUOYANG, Henan Province, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- It takes four hours for a high-speed train to travel from the modern capital of Beijing to Luoyang, capital of China's first dynasty, the Xia (2070-1600 B.C.), in central China's Henan Province.\n\nBut it would take Luoyang almost six and a half years to produce what Beijing achieved last year in terms of GDP.\n\nIn historical documents and fiction, Luoyang is depicted as a mighty political center just like Beijing. By the middle of the 10th century, Luoyang was already a bustling metropolis, and had already spent half of its then-3,000-year history as the capital of 13 dynasties.\n\nToday, the city resembles many of the country's other 600 cities. Visitors may hardly notice any trace of its past glory at first glance.\n\nOne reason is that its oldest architecture, which was made of wood, was destroyed by wars.\n\nBUILDING CONFIDENCE\n\nDespite being home to six UNESCO World Heritage sites, Luoyang is not as well known as western equivalents.\n\nIt is among several cities in China that had expanded away from instead of building on top of its ancients ruins in early 1950s.\n\nThe modern city landscape gives few clues of its historic past, except a designated field of 47 square kilometers, 10 times the size of Vatican City, in the downtown area.\n\nCultural relics have been detected underground. The city government has an ambitious plan to restore architecture of the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\n\"City planning and construction are intertwined with cultural relic protection,\" says Li Ya, Party secretary of Luoyang, \"If we can handle them well, it will be a win-win situation. But if we mess it up, the relics will either constrain development or they will be damaged.\"\n\n\"President Xi Jinping told us to have pride in our culture,\" he says, \"And people need something tangible to reach consensus on.\"\n\nLuoyang is the home to the Chinese civilization origin. Archaeologists identify the Erlitou ruins discovered in Luoyang in 1959 as one of the capital cities during the Xia Dynasty.\n\nThe local government is investing billions trying to restore the grandeur of what is believed to have been world's most populous city at the end of the 7th century.\n\nIt hints, according to some experts, that China will not only continue to be an economic powerhouse, but also strive to pick up its lost glory as a major civilization. China is promoting its cultural values and making its voice heard worldwide.\n\nAWAKING\n\nLuoyang was at its peak during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), when China's sole empress, Wu Zetian, moved the capital there from Chang'an (today's Xi'an), during her reign from 690 to 705.\n\nFollowing the rises and fall of dynasties, Luoyang gradually lost its luster as the center of China, and even of the world.\n\nThe city is underrated compared to other ancient capitals of China such as Xi'an which is known worldwide for its Terracotta Warriors.\n\nFallen but not forgotten, Luoyang was chosen as one of new China's heavy industry bases in the 1950s when the Communist Party of China (CPC) rebuilt the country after years of war.\n\nBeing the cradle of industries such as heavy mining machinery, tractors, bearings, nonferrous metal, and high-speed diesel engines, Luoyang has absorbed so many migrants that it became one of the most populated Chinese cities 60 years ago.\n\nToday, Luoyang has more than 7 million people, about the population of Bulgaria. Its GDP in 2016 was valued at 379.5 billion yuan (about 57.5 billion U.S. dollars), ranking second in Henan Province, and 51st among all cities in China.\n\nChina's aggregate economic output last year exceeded 74 trillion yuan (about 11.2 trillion U.S. dollars), representing a growth rate of 6.7 percent, among the fastest in the world.\n\nThe economic miracle sustained for almost 40 years since the country adopted the reform and opening up strategy in 1978. Luoyang is a beneficiary of the process.\n\nTo inject more vigor into its economy and maintain sustainable growth, China introduced supply-side structural reform at the end of 2015, which is expected to receive an endorsement at the 19th CPC National Congress scheduled to open on Oct.18.\n\n\"As an old industrial base, Luoyang has no chance other than undertaking the reform to revive,\" says Li.\n\nHe summarizes the city's development strategy as \"9+2\". Basically it aims to build systems of modern innovation, modern industries, modern market, modern urbanization, modern infrastructure, cultural inheritance and creation, eco-environment, openness, and public services.\n\nThe strategy echoes the five development concepts of innovation, coordination, green development, opening up and inclusiveness, proposed by the CPC in 2015. The \"big five\" is supposed to be a theme topic at the upcoming Party congress to produce future growth.\n\nHenan Province expects much from Luoyang, hoping it becoming one of the engines that drive the province's economy.\n\nAlmost all the provincial leaders - Party secretaries and governors - are deputies to the CPC congress, the most important meeting to decide China's next five year or even longer plans. The country's future development rests on the growth of hundreds of cities like Luoyang and thousands of counties.\n\n\"If we can make good use of the policies to be adopted at the congress, the effect would be as major as that of the 1950s,\" says Li.
