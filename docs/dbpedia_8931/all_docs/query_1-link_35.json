The Tuoba Xianbei people originated from an area in northeastern Inner Mongolia based on archaeological evidence from a sacred cave site discovered in 1980. They established the Northern Wei Dynasty in 386 CE which came to rule northern China. The Northern Wei rulers adopted Chinese culture and Buddhism, moving their capital to Luoyang in 494 CE. However, this alienated some Xianbei people and led to a civil war in 524 CE which divided the empire into Eastern and Western Wei dynasties.",
