        "text": "Luoyang was so magnificent, that at it’s height in the 6th century, this was the largest known city in the world. During the Han, Wei, and Tang dynasties, this storied city represented the political and cultural heart of the Middle Kingdom, and it was here that the legendary Silk Roads expanding west and linking China to the outside world began. Remarkably, the very gate that marked the outside of the city can still be seen today, though merely a forgotten relic in a nation filled with more treasures than one can imagine. Overshadowed by its much more famous neighbor Xi’an, Luoyang retains an undiscovered charm that it’s counterpart is getting harder to find.\n\nWhile exploring Luoyang today, one can’t help with imagine the caravans stocked with coveted Chinese silk and other fine goods departing the grand city gates of Luoyang, embarking on the long journeys that opened contacts across the Eurasian continent. But the roads were two-way exchanges - new ideas flowed in as well. The arrival of Buddhism from India in the 1st century AD led to the establishment of the White Horse Temple, among the oldest Buddhist monasteries in China. Not far away, the stunning carved Longmen Grottoes containing tens of thousands of Buddhist statues and images emerged as an unmatched artistic legacy along the Silk Road, perhaps rivaled only by that of the Mogao Caves.\n\nWhat Goods were Traded Here?\n\nSILK - Luoyang was a major producer of silk during the Han and Tang dynasties.\n\nPORCELAIN - Renowned and high quality kilns were produced in kilns in Luoyang.\n\nHow to Get Here\n\nWe took a high speed train just an hour or two east from Xi'an. Luoyang stands at a junction of major cities, and thus numerous train connections.\n\nOur Treasure\n\nThere exists the remains of the southern gate of the ancient city of Luoyang where the Silk Road actually started for centuries. It was quite surreal seeing the exact spot, even though it is just an afterthought today.\n\nExplore More\n\n➨ Go to the White Horse Temple"
