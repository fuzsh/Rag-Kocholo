While this metaphor remains constant throughout all the images, the specific a­ rchitectural context of the arch motif in each image has the capacity to set forth iterations unique to the individual elements present. The religious, secular, public, private, and academic sites found in these ­images provide contextual layers for reflection, but, for many viewers, it may be the juxtaposition of elements in the compositions that provide the most informative platforms for creating meaning in relation to the ­topics explored in these writings. The interaction between lintels and arches may prompt the viewer to consider the extent to which the relationship between these differing methods of spanning structural fenestrations was a purposeful synectic contrast or an intended synthetic confluence. Similarly, the interaction between intersecting arches that result in ambiguous shapes caused by low illumination levels raises observational questions relating to the role of alignment in perception as well as reconstructive questions concerning the amount of data required to articulate with accuracy the features of existing forms with reduced visual input. The root metaphor of the arch is thus offered not as an illustration of content but as a prompt for active consideration of the directions in which educationalization is currently being explored. Indeed, it is the active engagement with individually identified visual elements that is the intended focus of each image as well as the overall heuristic goal of the choices made in selecting the photographs. The wide range of juxtapositions resulting in apparent contrasts and others that result in ambiguity are focused on providing flexible visual cues for the reader to reflect on the topics explored by the authors of the chapters in this volume.\n\nx Artist’s Statement\n\nThe image entitled arched inclinations above is a photograph taken at the Episcopal Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine in New York City.

The symposium was funded by a Connection Grant from the Social Sciences and H ­ umanities Research Council of Canada1 and received extensive financial support from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, the Faculty of H ­ istory, G ­ eography, and Political Science at that university, and the Universidad de Deusto (Spain). The symposium involved the Theory and History of Education International Research Group (THEIRG), l­ocated within the Faculty of Education at Queen’s University in Kington, Ontario, and the History of Education Group of the Faculty of History at the Pontificia Católica in Santiago. Senior and ­ junior historians, educational theorists, and curricular theorists exchanged ideas and provided input on the ­papers presented. While discussions on educationalization have taken place in European educational circles in the past two decades and, to some extent, in the United States, this symposium brought a new ­dimension to the subject by including in the conversation ­Catholicism, rights to education, historical studies grounded in Canada and Chile, Indigenous issues, and the concept of educationalization in relation to our digital age. The term “educationalization” – ­initially pedagogisierun ­(pedagogization) – ­has been in use in Europe for some time, as Depaepe and S ­ meyers (2008), Depaepe et al. (2008), Depaepe (2012), and Tröhler (2016) have indicated. “Pedagogization” was replaced with “educationalization” to capture the trend in modernizing societies of transferring social ­responsibilities onto schools – ­with the function of schools thus evolving from the need to enforce moral behaviour, to solving social inequalities and to building a citizenry and improving productivity\n\n4 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\n(Depaepe and Smeyers 2008, 379; Depaepe 2012). In other words, “educationalization” has been used as a general concept for identifying the orientation of putting schooling in the service of solving social problems of various kinds that were not originally perceived as necessarily educational. Some authors have established a relationship between the process of educationalization and the process of the institutionalization of “childhood” and the growth of expertise in this field. “Educationalization” as a historiological conceptual tool has been further developed to encompass discussions of the expansion of schooling within the modern state and in processes of modernization. The process of educationalization has been deemed an essential characteristic of Western modernity (particularly late modernity). The term has also been utilized for making sense of the modern world and the modern self, as defined in educational terms (see chapter 1 by Tröhler in this volume), to pinpoint cultural or mental patterns as well as the educationalization of behaviour per se. In this respect, and combined with the position that education is connected to the process of modernization itself, it is possible to advance the notion of the “educationalization of the world,” as Tröhler does in this volume. By and large, “educationalization” carries a negative connotation. It has been argued that the trend to educationalize social problems has moved attention away from underlying structures of injustices (Labaree 2008). In this way, Labaree contends, the process of educationalization both provides stability and legitimates a social structure of inequality. The use of “educationalization” within the discipline of history developed out of the initiative taken by distinguished historians of education to construe specific historiological tools emerging from their field. As a scholar of history and a member of a faculty of education, I understand the historicity of education as a complex subject and I acknowledge the utility of developing concepts that will help to build explanations as well as uncover trends in longue durée analysis. However, I concur with Martin Schiralli, who writes that “the study of education is a congeries of coherent applications of the social and behavioural sciences, curriculum-based subject matters, philosophy and common sense.”2 I also think, as does Schiralli, that “what counts as a coherent set of such applications over time will vary significantly with changes in the fabric of social life, the economy, and the prevailing modes of meaning and communication.” These variations will resonate also in any historical analysis of education, which further increases the complexity of the field of study. Therefore, I am in agreement with Depaepe’s and other authors’ preferred focus of working out specific concepts that allow for some level of abstraction without denying the unique and intertwined\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nhistorical reality of educational phenomena. “Educationalization” is a promising concept, although I have reservations about the way it has been applied and how its meaning has been construed. On another note, if we are to apply the concept to a specific analysis – ­and by this I mean if we are to speak of the educationalization of social problems – ­I would prefer to construe that process as an extension of various pedagogical knowledges through schooling to cover all dimensions of life, in particular, the needs that would fit with a particular religious, social, political, and/or economic, or even cultural, project. A case in point is that current uses of technology, as William Pinar writes in chapter 11, “Educationalization as Technologization,” could be construed as creating a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) state of mind and thus as acquiring a central place in processes of educationalization. I would also problematize the use of “educationalization” as a heuristic concept, and the construction of its historical meaning. Education has an inherent socializing component. I agree with Bridges (2008) that education cannot be freed from the educationalization of social issues. The historical shape that the pattern of educationalization took over time – i­f we want to use the explanatory power of the concept – ­deserves explanations that go into analysis of the contexts of structures and discourses in a longue durée frame, considering conjonctures, intersections of gender, sexuality, class, domination, and so on. In all this, there should be an implicit understanding that there is content, direction, and purpose, and, furthermore, that there is a link between conceptions of education and the intentionality behind the process of educationalization. If we were to approach education as schooling or as educational interventions guided by institutions or organizations, it would become important, following Basil Bernstein (1990), to pay attention to “the relation among discourses, social relations, division of labour, and transmission systems which create the relation between ideology and consciousness [and to how] [s]ymbolic control translates power relations into discourse and discourse into power relations” (134). However, it is here where I encounter the limits of educationalization as a concept construed with strong negative connotations. Power relations can, of course, be interrupted, and educational intervention can certainly be pursued as a counter-discursive and even political practice. The case of the Movement of Grassroots Education (Movimiento de E ­ ducacion de Base), sponsored by Catholic bishops in Brazil in the early 1960s in the midst of the educational projects of the US Alliance for Progress, is a good example of such an interruption. Thus, although it is useful\n\n6 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\nto examine the intentionality behind policies and practices that we are conceptualizing as “educationalization,” we need to be cautious about its all-embracing character. In this volume, Ana Jofre discusses the creation of digital tools for critical evidence-based thinking (chapter 12), and Josh Cole explores a historical case in Canada of “education that is not educationalization” (chapter 4). I also agree with Bridges’s (2008) view that the educationalization of social problems in a broad sense can be seen as a characteristic of a normally functioning government, and that there are cases when state intervention may be seen as appropriate. Bridges makes a powerful point when he writes that “the strong complaint (that it is always inappropriate to look for educational solutions to economic and social problems) seems difficult to maintain without emptying education of rationale and content” (470). The author refers here to the capacity of educational programs and institutions to contribute to social, economic, and political change. In more or less open societies, the state needs to negotiate claims, even insofar as transformative language may be diluted, produce eclectic recommendations, and re-address human rights–related wrongdoing, often through educational policies and curricula. To cite a recent example, Indigenous peoples in Ontario, Canada, have been bringing to the official school curricula their dramatic experience in residential schools and their cultural values in order to generate awareness in new generations. In the schools they run, there are serious efforts made to work out alternative educational aims, even as they work with the official curricula. The Ministry of Education has responded to recommendations and reports, in particular those from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to foster greater understanding of the historical and contemporary experience of Indigenous people in Canada. Education through schooling, in other words, has become the means through which to generate awareness of one of the most painful issues in Canada’s history of colonization and to further Indigenous people’s goals. Overall, educational policies – ­­and this is important when analysing educationalization, particularly in contemporary times – a­re indeed constrained by transnational capital and by responses to supranational organizations and non-governmental organizations, domestic pressures and demands (for example, the government’s need to maintain political legitimacy), and the system’s own internal needs and self-interests (Burbules and Torres 2000). As hinted at above, I deem it imperative that the examination of conceptions of education – a­ nd not just references to the learning of something – ­be integrated into the conversation under view. Mentioning environmental education as part of the processes of educationalization\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nis not the same as referring to learning driving skills. Concepts such as training and indoctrination seem to be conflated with the concept of education within the notion of “educationalization.” A grounded analysis would be expected to unpack those concepts. There is also the danger of conflating education with schooling or with a particular understanding of education. Attention to conceptions of education and clarification of those concepts will not only highlight the potential oppressive side of, or the ­nuances sustaining, the intentionality to generate a self-governing citizenry, for example, but also help us understand other dimensions of educational practices. These dimensions may include critical reflective practices implemented by specific groups of teachers, counter-discursive practices as in the case of the Indigenous peoples in Canada, or openly political practices such as the popular education movement in Latin America in the 1970s. To rephrase my point here, while it is important to recognize that subjects are conditioned by social, cultural, linguistic, ­political, and ideological forces, there is danger in embracing the idea of an individual or collective self as exhausted by those external forces. Such a subject becomes dehistoricized. From a pedagogical perspective, when using “educationalization,” it would be best to avoid the possibility of bestowing upon educational/pedagogical interventions tremendous power (and even displaying a nihilist shade) without hope and space for the exercise of agency. We also ought not to renounce the seeking of practical critiques and “transgressions,” nor should we leave aside an ethically defensible conception of education and educational aims. Where do we place in our analysis educational aims such as awareness of the interconnectedness of life and of shared human dignity? What about “the level of the individual person endeavoring to cultivate (‘culturate’) her or his life as meaningfully and seriously as circumstances permit” (Hansen 2010, 43)? It can be argued that most definitions of “educationalization” as an analytical tool exclude these considerations. Another concern I have regarding “educationalization” takes me back some time ago, when I wrote, with an idealistic bent: “Education, it has been said again and again, has a concern with the good life, notions of justice, relationships between self and others, and between ­humans and the natural world; it should be desirable and transformative. Educational theories of necessity became, in the latter part of the twentieth century, sensitive to claims of social and political movements and started to engage with notions of diversity, and de-centered power” (Bruno-Jofré 2012, 1). Education has a normative character; it has to do with dispositions and habits of mind, and it is commonplace\n\n8 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\nto say that, particularly in formal education, it is linked to social and economic policies of one sort or another. So, despite the passage of time, and a re-assessment of some views I held at the time of my writing the above, I don’t want to neglect the idealist component of education and its potential to engender desired social transformation and/ or personal or social improvement in line with the pedagogical tenets of Paulo Freire. In this as well I find echoes in Bridges. He writes: “We cannot really conceive of education without reference to some selection of the human qualities we want to cultivate and of the kind of social world we expect or perhaps want our pupils to occupy – a­ nd that selection requires an inescapable responsibility to invoke some normative conception of the human qualities and the social world we see as desirable” (2008, 466). An example of educationalization that is often used is the educationalization of our behaviour toward nature. Courses for future teachers normally include environmental education. I agree with this inclusion. The cosmology sustaining our conception of education has changed, and we have strongly questioned Western dominant cosmology and placed humans in a different relationship with God (Christian theologians were active in developing eco-spirituality), the earth, and the universe. Concerning the expansion of educational content and new curricula, as in the example indicated above, it would be prudent to utilize Bernstein’s (1990) conception of “recontextualization.” So, to follow Bernstein’s lead, the inclusion in state schooling of pedagogized forms of knowledge, identities, and social structures from other societal fields would represent a case of the social transformation of categories of knowledge. It would be key when discussing the understanding of current patterns of educationalization and their evolution to also consider the understandings of education and “excellence” within a dominant knowledge-based economy as an integral part of neoliberal globalization and of the changing nature of the relationship between capitalism and Western modernity (Dale 2014, 34; Bruno-Jofré and Hills 2011). In faculties of education, the observable crucial issue is the replacement of a language of education and educational aims with a language of learning, leaving aside the considerations that, as Biesta (2013; 2014) writes, students learn something and from someone, and that what they learn is for particular reasons. Biesta (2014) makes clear that learning is a process – ­individualistic and individualizing – ­while education is interested in content and purpose and in relationships. Portelli (2012) poses a question to educators regarding their future work: How can we critically – ­even subversively – ­approach neoliberal\n\nIntroduction 9\n\npractices in educational institutions and question the myth that the achievement gap can be reduced by improving test scores? How important is it to read the world as Freire asked us to? I would add: What kind of polity would we like to embrace? In some places in the world, European universals such as citizenship and understandings of Western freedom that are moved through processes of educationalization are denaturalized concepts. How people are enacting values is also part of this picture. For example: How are educators combating discursive forms of racism in the curriculum? In 2015, Joyce E. King, in her presidential address to the American Educational Research Association, called for the dismantling of “epistemological nihilation” (embodied not only in physical and psychic violence against black people, but in curriculum “that does violence to Black students’ spirit and thirst for knowledge”) (King 2017, 211). She argued for solidarity and a moral instance to combat discursive forms of racism in praxis, policy, and research, and claimed “group belonging” to be a human right. She called for epistemological emancipation. Fleshing out the specificity of educationalization in relation to the schooling of African-American students and agency may provide an understanding of the characteristics of that particular pattern of educationalization in a broader context, and of the counter-discourse that has emerged. Keeping the foregoing qualifications in mind, educationalization can be a powerful explanatory tool; the concept gains heuristic strength when used in relation to other concepts, and as long as agency is not left outside of the picture. Educationalization has explanatory and heuristic power within the context under analysis and within the historicity of the case, which involves local conditions including forms of political action in time and place – ­conditions not only crowded and disjointed, but also animated by dynamic and contesting socio-political forces. In such a context, the concept would have to take a “vernacular” character. This collection makes a contribution to the historiographical debate on educationalization, by grounding its use in actual historical research and including curricular and philosophical reflection. In these contributions, the concept is re-signified, in that its heuristic power is expanded or problematized. The reader will find the chapters are organized in five parts: Part I offers contesting views of processes of educationalization at its intersection with Christianity and discusses historical causation in relation to the historical trend in modernity conceptualized as educationalization; Part II concentrates on Catholicism, spirituality, and educationalization; Part III is devoted to educationalization and the right to education/schooling; Part IV examines educationalization and\n\n10 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\ndemocratic spaces in the digital era; and Part V deals with educationalization as a tool of colonization and its counter-dimension in Indigenous educational agendas. The collection closes with a concluding analysis. Part I, “Contesting Views of Processes of Educationalization at the Intersection with Christianity,” opens with Daniel Tröhler’s chapter entitled “The Dignity of Protestant Souls: Protestant Trajectories in the Educationalization of the World.” Tröhler, a historian of education, tries to explain how a particular mental pattern or reflex labelled “educationalization” became a dominant and fundamental way to understand the world and the self and a way to educationalize behaviours toward, for example, the environment. The contentious point in his argument is the historical causal link he establishes with Protestantism, more precisely in terms of Zwinglianism reaching this point after following the trajectories of Calvinism and Zwinglianism (Swiss Protestantism) and German Lutheranism. Apart from the transformations that he places around 1700, he identifies “Protestant psychology (avant la letter), or the Protestant conception of the soul, as the crucial principle allowing the educationalization of the challenges or problems that were detected with regard to these transformations.” Tröhler then discusses the two paradigmatic educational ideologies that would culminate with the vision of Bildung on one side and the virtuous citizen on the other. He places particular emphasis on the idea of the soul (and its disposition to perfectability) as the exclusive place of salvation without institutional mediation – u ­ nlike the Catholic Church. By the end of the nineteenth century, school and curricula were major means of making citizens, even if they were not citizens, as in democratic republics. Catholic countries, in Tröhler’s view, were behind educational expansion, and when Catholicism contributed to educationalization, it did so by using ideas and strategies that came from Protestantism. The chapter that follows, “Multiple Early Modernities and Educationalization: Reframing the Confessional Debate on Education, Politics, and Religion in Early Modern Europe,” was written by Carlos Martínez Valle. Martínez, a political scientist with a background in early European modernity, invites the reader to think beyond the parameters set by Tröhler and introduces a theological political discussion that challenges Tröhler’s thesis. Martínez examines the theology of John Calvin and Martin Luther – t­heir rejection of free will and millenarianism and anti-modernist positioning – ­as contested within Protestantism. He analyses the theories and ideas of John Milton, comparing them with those of the Jesuits Molina and Suárez – ­they, like Milton, were advocates of free will and charity/probabilism – a­ nd of a sensual epistemology. Martínez aims at pointing in his argument to the\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nintra-confessional differences and inter-confessional similarities that, in his words, “turn ‘Protestantism’ and ‘Catholicism’ into terms of little use for historical analysis because they lead to overgeneralizations.” His analysis calls our attention to an important point – ­that the ­concept of “educationalization” could be used to analyse the requirements and objectives of society, and of the educational subsystem, which has “increasingly become functionally differentiated and self-referential.” Furthermore, he points out that education has been a socially dependent subsystem even more than in early modernity, a time when both Catholics and Protestants adopted literacy methods to increase school attendance and secure religious indoctrination (confessionalization). Martínez focuses on Tröhler’s thesis on the Protestant origins of educationalization and modern education. Various points made by Martínez are of relevance here, such as the difficulty of establishing a causal relation between orthodox Protestant psychagogies and schooling/literacy, since the latter was determined more by socio-economic and political than religious factors. In fact, it was enlightened absolutism that ­created schools in the process of state building. Certainly, schooling predated the Reformation and was rooted in humanism and scholasticism. Martínez’s analysis of the Jesuits Molina and Suárez and the comparison with Milton leads him to conclude that, for example, there was nothing new or even Protestant in Zwingli’s defence of t­yrannicide, a point that Tröhler considers central for a form of republicanism and citizenship that led to educationalization. In fact, the Jesuits educated political cadres with the goal of education being the ability to lead an active and virtuous life. Readers can make up their own mind. Daniel Tröhler’s chapter opens an interesting debate, although one can ponder the historical significance of the question of the origins of educationalization as coming from a particular branch of Protestantism, given the ubiquity of the uses of education, internal differences, uniqueness of Catholic social education, and the fluidity of educational ideas in term of theories and methods across confessions from the time of early modernity. Historian Rosa Bruno-Jofré’s chapter, “Catholicism and Educationalization,” provides a long-term analysis, starting from early modernity, of Catholic involvement with education and forms of schooling. She builds on her extensive research on all things Catholic and the history of Catholic congregations from a social history, secular perspective. Complex intentionalities intersected confessionalization with the social teaching of the church and the concern with social illnesses generated by poverty, and with the political and theological dimension of a Catholic ordered society. Protestants and Catholics alike were involved\n\n12 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\nin educational practices, and they generated pedagogies from early modernity. The point here is that, from very early on, Catholics, in their encounters with modernity and in response to Protestantism, played a significant role in schooling through their teaching congregations, as conveyed in Part III of this book; Catholics did not take their approach to education/educationalization from Protestantism, although it can be argued that there were mutual influences. Catholic interaction with the state, along with processes of social and functional differentiation, took various forms, from the church’s carving its space in the educational system through its own schools to its being in open conflict with the state, in particular with liberal republican ones. The social teachings of the church led to various practices countering the described dominance of educationalization, in particular in the twentieth century. (One such practice is analysed in detail in the context of adult education in Nova Scotia, Canada, by Josh Cole in this volume.) Bruno-Jofré makes the point that educational processes – ­forms of educationalization or proto-educationalization (using the concept to refer to the use of education/schooling to deal with challenges encountered by the church as well as societal problems) – w ­ ere mediated not only by the official doctrine of the church, but also by contextual, theological, and social configurations and, often, by the enactment of intentionalities and individual agency rooted in the tradition of free will. The ­author reviews historical turning points to unsettle notions of “sameness” and uniformity in the church, a multifarious institution, accentuating its internal differences, the uniqueness of the congregations, dissensions with the magisterium, censorship from the magisterium, and even the consolidation of dissenting visions. Bruno-Jofré works out her points – ­which separate her interpretation from Tröhler’s – b ­y discussing historical moments in the intersection of the church and its plurality of cultural formations with modernity, having education/ schooling as a point of reference. The chapter goes from early modernity – t­he sixteenth to eighteenth centuries – t­hrough the long nineteenth century, which O’Malley places from the French Revolution to 1958, when Pius XII died. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the long 1960s – a­ period designated by Marwick as the time between 1958 and 1974 – y ­ ears of paradigmatic shift within the church and of dramatic changes in education, including an epistemic break in educational theory as a result of grassroots experiences and the systematization of the ideas of Catholic philosopher of education Paulo Freire. Part I closes with a chapter by historian and Canadianist Josh Cole, entitled “Antigonish, or an ‘Education That Is Not Educationalization,’” that expands the parameters of the concept and moves the discussion\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nto a form of education that was counter-educationalization, protagonized by the Catholic Antigonish movement in the 1920s and 1930s, in eastern Nova Scotia, Canada. This movement, which was grounded in andragogy (adult education), was infused by rural ideologies and Catholic principles, utilized the mass media of the time, and broke the separation between school and society and between the teacher and the student. The leaders placed their faith front and centre, with all forms of cultural life tying faith to cooperative economics and utopian andragogy. This grassroots project was a Nova Scotian interpretation of the social teaching of the church, even as the magisterium was as doctrinal as it could be at the time. Thus, this critique of modern capitalism in the form of an enactment of a civic project had its unique bent. And, as Cole writes, “democracy was the beginning and the end point of Antigonish ... and its drive for ‘an education that is not ­educationalization,’” within the context of a “counterpublic sphere” (a concept he borrows from Nancy Fraser) aiming at “intelligent political action.” The Antigonish movement was a response to the consequences of liberal-democratic capitalism, and to modernity, in a particular part of Canada. The details of the Antigonish project, which, incidentally, had a long-lasting influence on the missionary work of various congregations, remind us of the educational theories of another Catholic, Paulo Freire. Cole’s chapter offers a historical example that illustrates the need to use the historiographical concept of educationalization in articulation with other concepts and theories. It also points to the variations and spaces inside the Catholic Church. Part II, “Catholicism, Spirituality, and Educationalization,” is developed by members of the group who have been conducting research on the history of Catholic education for many years. It opens with historian Elizabeth M. Smyth’s “Educationalization of the Modern World: The Case of the Loretto Sisters in British North America,” a chapter that challenges Tröhler’s notion of educationalization of the modern world and, in particular, the links he established with Protestantism as a source of the process. Smyth skilfully narrates, through the use of multiple archival sources, the insertion of women’s teaching congregations in the building of the state and its educational system in Canada, and its intersection with confessionalizing agendas, whether Catholic or Protestant. The congregations adopted the official curricula in their schools and pursued teaching certifications, engaging with modernity in a variety of ways, as the church itself did in spite of its anti-modernist discourse. The alignment of the curriculum with external agencies, writes Smyth, gave the sisters’ students access to teacher education as well as music and business certification, and provided them with the\n\n14 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\ncredentials to enter professions, within the gender limitations of the time. Two congregations in Toronto, St Joseph and Loretto, established women’s colleges affiliated with the University of Toronto through St Michael’s College. This chapter introduces questions about the ­ ­applicability of the concept of educationalization and the need to expand its heuristic capacity if we want to capture complex articulations of the trend ­described by the concept. Historian Heidi MacDonald contributed “New Educational Approaches of Women Religious in the Global South, 1968–1980.” The chapter refers to the work of the Sisters of Charity–Halifax in Peru and the Dominican Republic between 1968 and 1980. This congregation was devoted to elementary and secondary school teaching, and particularly to the education of the poor as inspired by St Vincent de Paul and Elizabeth Seton. From early modernity, the Catholic Church had seen schooling as a way to pursue confessionalization as well as to deal with social, economic, and political problems. In that sense, we can use the concept of educationalization beyond its relation to late modernity and even contemporary processes. MacDonald narrates that, in 1849, the archbishop of Halifax invited the Sisters of Charity–New York to provide Catholic students with an education that would allow them to have roles in politics, the professions, and business. Catholics held minority status in the United States and were the targets of anti-Catholic feelings. A century later, when Vatican II (1962–5) moved social justice to the forefront, the sisters turned their efforts to the southern hemisphere, specifically Peru and the Dominican Republic, and, in particular, to adult education. As with other congregations nourished by liberation theology and inspired by the approach to community work of the Coady Institute, the sisters’ educational intervention can be construed as a counter-discourse and practice. The sisters used educational intervention to challenge the educationalization process (in its negative connotation), which pursued a particular economic and political agenda, in most cases with American support or alongside agendas that were not rooted in participatory democratic practices. Joseph Stafford, a former history teacher with a thirty-year career in a Catholic school who completed his PhD with a thesis on the history of secondary Catholic religious education in Ontario and the impact of Vatican II, contributed a chapter entitled “The Educationalization Process and the Roman Catholic Church in North America during the Long Nineteenth Century.” This chapter examines how the Catholic Church articulated an educationalization process in North America aimed at securing a place for the Catholic faith in the new order, beginning in the nineteenth century when the Holy See adopted neo-scholasticism – a­\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nform of strict neo-Thomism – t­ o counter the “errors” of modernity. This process was linked to confessionalization, which did not share the intentionality of the larger educationalization process linked to the state. Yet it often converged with the state, although, at other moments, it competed for spaces in the overall system. Stafford identifies two stages: one, the imposition of neo-scholasticism; the other, the social work of Catholic Action. The educationalization process, he argues, was facilitated by the classicist culture dominant in North American Catholic circles. This was a culture aimed at integral wholeness, something to which every Catholic should aspire under the leadership of the church, rather than individually working out their own set of values. The result was the “Catholic mind,” a particular mindset, even a collective world view, moulded by neo-scholasticism, while theologians in Europe pluralized neo-Thomism and embarked on what is known as “nouvelle theologie.” This state of affairs lasted until Vatican II. However, the official implementation of policies did not imply that Catholic students embraced the vision of the magisterium, or even that they understood neo-scholasticism/neo-Thomism. In the long 1960s, the certainty that many Catholics had about their religion disintegrated and was replaced largely by an empiricist culture; at the same time, a search started for a process of educationalization suitable to contemporary Catholic life. The history of congregations and their teaching would eventually help in providing a more nuanced picture of what happened in schools. Jon Igelmo Zaldívar, in his chapter “Educationalization in the Spanish Second Republic and the Expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain,” explores educationalization, having as reference David Labaree’s (2008) understanding of educationalization as aiming to stabilize and legitimize a social structure of inequality that could lead to conflict, thus making everything into a school subject. Igelmo uses rich archival sources to narrate the place the Jesuits had in the Spanish educational setting with their colleges and schools, and their expulsion from Spain in 1932, during the Second Republic. Jesuit faculties of theology and Jesuit schools were then occupied to serve republican educational goals and inculcate republican principles. Igelmo finds a discursive continuity in this dramatic process of change, in which republican leaders – ­many of them with ties to the Institucion Libre de Enseñanza – ­tried to replace the Society of Jesus in its leading historical role of educationalizing Spanish society from a Catholic perspective. In light of Bourdieu’s theory of habitus, capital, and field, Igelmo establishes a continuity in the process of change. This continuity, he argues, is grounded in the disposition toward education being understood as a habitus, and is conveyed in the understanding of the uses of educationalization to cope with social and\n\n16 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\npolitical problems or to transform society. The research Igelmo is further undertaking will help to historize the change he examines in this chapter and will allow for future discussions of points of contact and differences in the understanding of education and educational aims within substantively different political and philosophical foundations. Part II closes with a chapter by Patricia Quiroga Uceda, entitled “Waldorf Education and the Educationalization of Spirituality in the Plural Context in Late Twentieth-Century Spain.” Quiroga Uceda ­argues that the reception of Waldorf education in Spain during the last decade of Francoism, and the subsequent creation of educational centres during the democratic transition, was part of an educationalized spirituality. Waldorf schools, created by Rudolf Steiner in 1913, were grounded on anthroposophy, an esoteric spirituality that synthetized various religious creeds, including Christianity. The Waldorf schools arrived in Spain, a country where the Catholic Church had a dominant role in education and where other religious and spiritual conceptions had little presence, during a time of religious crisis and increasing pluralism. The author uses Charles Taylor’s paradigm of secularization and Peter Berger’s paradigm of pluralism to argue that Waldorf education in Spain fit with the spiritual and educational aspirations of a minority group of Spaniards at the end of the Franco regime and in the transition to a pluralistic society. This esoteric pedagogical model, in Quiroga Uceda’s view, was a manner of educationalizing spirituality. It appealed to a population weary of Catholicism with an ethos that aimed at improving society and engaged children and families in an alternative pedagogy. There are currently thirty Waldorf schools in Spain. Part III, “Educationalization and the Right to Education/Schooling,” moves to institutional issues and policies and to the educatee as political subject. Argentinian educationalist Felicitas Acosta addresses the issues of rights to education within the framework of scholarization and the expansion of schooling in “Educationalization, Schooling, and the Right to Education.” She uses Latin America as a point of reference in relation to the expansion of schooling within the framework of the right to education and makes the point that the framework of rights is related to educationalization. She places her argument in line with Tröhler’s thesis on educationalization and sees the deployment of mass schooling as a means to address social problems and consolidate capitalism and the nation state. On the origins of the process, the Enlightenment idea of the social contract can be placed at the centre, since the social contract, in Acosta’s view, positioned the state in the role of educator. The individual future (male) citizen became the new educational actor and object. In her view, from the perspective of the\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nexpansion of schooling, education and schooling became equivalent while an intensive process of educationalization was taking place. She discusses the configuration and various landmarks of the expansion of the educational system in Latin America, which occurred within a process of homogenization that aimed at national integration, although regional disparities were exhibited. Next, she examines developmentalist economic policies in the 1950s that generated expansion and then looks at the further expansion in the late 1980s. From this examination, she concludes that, when the right to education is understood as the right to schooling, it implies a broad scale “but it also implies that any educational supply is constructed on the basis of or in tension with the forms of schooling.” Policies should be re-examined from this perspective. Part IV, “Educationalization and Democratic Spaces in the Digital Era,” deals with the impact of new information and communication technologies and social media. The chapter of curricular educationalist theorist William Pinar, entitled “Educationalization as Technologization,” conceives “technologization” as a form of educationalization. Technology is expressed, he writes, as instrumental rationality, in the form of computers or other devices, reflecting a conviction that the salvation of humanity resides in the control of nature – ­even human nature. He uses as reference Tröhler’s notion of the educationalization of the world, which is not limited to solving social problems but is connected to the process of modernization itself. Ideas of freedom, science, and modernization have converged in technologization, and in “the ‘creative destruction’ of culture it encourages, including shifts in subjectivity, politics, and schooling.” Pinar juxtaposes George Grant’s critique of technology with trends today, including the quantification of educational outcomes, the technologizing of teaching, and the moving of curriculum online. A main point Pinar makes is that “curriculum is no longer an ongoing ethical question – w ­ hat knowledge is of most worth? – ­but whatever software designers deem saleable, ‘learning activities’ now redesigned as ‘consumer goods.’” He goes back to Grant for how to respond, and uncovers Grant’s idea that only in attuning ourselves to “deprival” can we “live critically” in the “dynamo” and provide a passage to the past “becoming historical.” Ana Jofre, a physicist, artist, and professor of creative arts and technology, takes a different stand in her contribution entitled “Countering Patterns of Educationalization: Creating Digital Tools for Critical Evidence-Based Thinking.” In her view, digital communications should play a central role in educational processes. She converges in her interest with Josh Cole, who wrote about education that was not educationalization, with respect to schools with no walls and blurring the\n\n18 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\ndistinction between school and society. There are, however, questions regarding how people are dealing with digital information. Relying on Habermas’s notion of the public sphere and the idea that not learning is unnatural, Jofre explores how to use digital technology in the public sphere, with a foundational interest in education for citizenship, and presents original projects within her own art and design practice that intersect with public humanities and public pedagogy. Jofres’s tools are aimed at supporting and stimulating critical evidence-based thinking, with a focus on data. Part V, “Educationalization as a Tool of Colonization and Its CounterDimension in Indigenous Educational Agendas: Limits and Possibilities,” concentrates on various dimensions of educationalization as a pattern of educational intervention serving the ends of colonization while also acquiring unexpected significations. The issue goes back to the link to religion.3 Bonita Uzoruo, a teacher of Aboriginal ancestry and a graduate student in the Master of Education in World Indigenous Studies in Education program at Queen’s University, contributed “Educationalization in Canada: The Use of Native Teacher Education as a Tool of Decoloniality.” Uzoruo first discusses the Canadian government’s use of education in the form of segregated industrial and residential schools run by religious of various Christian denominations, both Catholic and Protestant, as a tool for assimilation and cultural annihilation, and later as a project of integration with non-Natives, starting in the 1960s. She marks the difference between the characteristics of the work of Catholic missionaries in Chile, examined by Serrano and Ponce de León in this volume, and the way missionaries conducted their work in Canada in conjunction with the federal government. She then delves into the socio-political conditions of the 1960s and early 1970s that provided the contextual framework for how the First Nations regained control of their children’s education and articulated a vision for an education oriented toward Indigenous values. Uzoruo then moves to the central piece in this decolonizing view of education, Native teacher education programs, and pays attention to a specific program, the Brandon University Northern Teacher Education Program, in the province of Manitoba. Her reflections centre, with an optimistic tone, on Native teacher education programs as educational tools of decoloniality, leading to a recovery of Aboriginal culture, language, and identity. In the end, the programs aim at overcoming social conditions and try to solve the consequences of (mis)education through (re)education. Philosopher Chris Beeman contributed “Indigeneity and Educationalization.” He refers to David Labaree’s analysis of contemporary\n\nIntroduction 19\n\neducationalization as a formalist process, in which public schools are a vehicle for societal aspirations to be expressed, with the non-stated expectation that education will not solve problems. Beeman examines the work of pioneers in educationalization, such as Marc Depaepe and Paul Smeyers, and applies Labaree’s analysis to First Nation, Metis, and Inuit youth. He illuminates how the endeavour to educate these youth is understood as a convenient separation of a “problem” into a sphere in which it is unable to be solved, while keeping the appearance of an attempt to do so. Educationalization is thus seen as an aspect of colonization that can be applied to all students (not just Aboriginal students) who are part of a school that curtails their interaction with the more-than-human world – w ­ ith mother earth. The point that Beeman also makes is that schooling has moved to serve the neoliberal interests of the state, which accentuate individual freedom and interest over public good. He argues that we need to understand residential schools as places in which culture was unlearned and where everything was different from the Indigenous children’s lived experience: the children had to relinquish their identity and learn a new identity of “being a student.” Beeman, who uses stories in his teaching, examines the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from the perspective of educationalization, with particular references to the clauses regarding education and negotiations with the state, and notes that the structures around education are being manipulated by the state. His argument takes an even less hopeful turn when he points out that, from the perspective of educationalization – ­in line with Labaree’s concept – ­the new approach may actually succeed in implicating Indigenous parents and culture in a more subtle form of colonization. Further, Beeman is concerned that goals like the closing of achievement gaps “might be an exact fit for the loss of an ontologically interconnected way of being with the world” as they could weaken even further the little that remains of the ontos of Indigeneity. This reflection is based on his observation that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report does not convey an understanding of how different the ontos of Indigeneity is from that of “homo mobilis.” Beeman introduces the reader to a discussion of Indigeneity, Autochthony, and ontological incommensurability, and also brings in the voices of Elders. He leaves the reader with questions that will motivate new ways of thinking on Indigeneity. Part V closes with “Capuchin Missions in Mapuche Territory: The Education of an Original People in Chile from 1880 to 1930,” written by Chilean historians Sol Serrano and Macarena Ponce de León. The chapter examines the missionary work of the Capuchin order of brothers from Bavaria, who constructed, in the authors’ words, a narrative\n\n20 Rosa Bruno-Jofré\n\ncentred in the understanding that the Mapuche people possessed a genuine culture and essential values that would enable their culture to become a “civilized” one. The Bavarian Capuchins defended the organic character of the Mapuche culture and repudiated any form of racism. The mission consisted of stations that included a large field for vegetable gardens and grazing, a school, a house, and a church. Indigenous schools were installed in these rural areas, some with boarding schools. Mission stations aimed also at defending the Indigenous community and provided health care and material assistance in addition to religion and schooling. However, for political reasons, the local population, the Mapuche people, wanted Spanish, not Mapudungun, spoken in the schools. Consequently, the original conception of the early work of the Capuchin mission took a different direction. Public schools followed, mostly in areas that were close to train stations, but the state left the Andean fringe to missionaries. The mission schools of the Bavarian Capuchins were used by the national state for its own strategy in the Araucanía, at a time when Chileans and immigrants were moving there and taking land, and when the schools had a mixed population. Here is where the authors situate educationalization. Yet the Mapuche people used education to defend their land and culture, in particular during the final stage of occupation, between 1910 and 1930. The Mapuche people perceived the skills provided by the public and missionary schools as important for the preservation of Mapuche culture. The “Chilenization” process had profoundly affected their way of life, but the Mapuche leaders used formal education to empower themselves and resist by defending their interests; this was clearly expressed in legal litigation and in the creation of societies such as the Sociedad Caupolicán Defensora de la Araucanía (1910), which was organized by primary school teachers, some of whom had attended mission schools, and the Sociedad Mapuche de Protección Mutua de Loncoche (1916), a precursor of the Gran Federación Araucana (1922), which sought territorial autonomy. This detailed chapter, grounded in many years of research in national and regional archives, provides a historical case that shows the complex facets of processes of educationalization and the need to expand the use of the concept, in line with other concepts that help in delving into reception, resistance, and agency, and in capturing the dynamics of educational interaction. The book closes with a concluding chapter by Josh Cole and Ian McKay that anticipates new critical directions for scholarship in education. This collection represents an attempt to deepen the discussion on educationalization, its construction as a concept, and its use; to explore educationalization in relation to Catholicism (a topic of research among\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nmany members of the Theory and History of Education International Research Group); to read the right to education in light of the concept of educationalization; to discuss “technologization” as a form of educationalization, and, as an alternative, the creation of digital tools for critical evidence-based thinking; and to look at the process of educationalization in reference to Indigenous experiences of education in Canada and Chile, including ontological questions regarding the basic stances of human beings toward the world around them, themselves, and each other. This book acknowledges the pioneering work on educationalization as an explanatory and heuristic concept, as reflected in the seminars of the research group Philosophy and History of the Discipline of Education: Evaluation and Evolution of the Criteria for Educational Research (established in 1999 by the Research Foundation, Flanders, Belgium), subsequent publications, and a special issue of Educational Theory.4 The following chapters, which are, by and large, based on original research conducted over a long period of time, open up questions, grounded in meaning coming from the specificity of historical situations, about the uses of educationalization as a heuristic concept, and they invite further theorization. Is it historically sensible to extend the application of “educationalization” to early modernity, and in particular to Catholic schooling efforts after the Protestant reformations? Is “educationalization” a concept that allows for an understanding of counter-discursive or counter-hegemonic uses of education, or that explains the reception and appropriation of schooling by, for example, the Mapuche people in Chile? How do we capture the nuances of (educational) systems that are highly differentiated and self-referential, but also of counter-practices as well as the agency of subjects? As well, in light of the digitalization of our lives, the concept of educationalization of the world will need other conceptual tools. These probing questions investigated in this volume invite further exploration. NOTES 1 Connection Grant of the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, file no 611-2016-0247.

The United States, as leader of the Western bloc in the Cold War, reacted with a double strategy. First, it founded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 to enhance aerospace. Second, in the same year, it passed its first national education law, the National Defense Education Act, expressing the view that “education is our first line of defense” (Rickover 1959, 15). This educational response to the Soviet lead in astronautics, understood as a military threat, may be somewhat surprising at first glance, but it points in fact to a particular cultural or mental pattern or reflex that today is discussed under the catchword “educationalization.” This observed pattern or reflex refers to the cultural phenomenon that we today very likely assign all different kinds of perceived social, economic, or military problems almost immediately to education, often without realizing why and how we are educationalizing these perceived problems. Yet, as anthropologist Margaret Mead is said to have once noted, “If a fish were to become an anthropologist, the last thing it would discover would be water” (quoted in Spindler 1982, 24). The general thesis of this chapter is about the water of this fish-anthropologist, about a particular culture that applies this educationalization of all kinds of perceived problems. The focus is neither on education (theories, institutions, practices) as such nor on the mere observation that (and how) the perceived social, economic, or military problems are almost immediately assigned to education. Rather, the thesis is an attempt to explain how this particular cultural or mental pattern or reflex labelled “educationalization” became possible in the course of history and how it developed from rather modest beginnings\n\n28 Daniel Tröhler\n\ninto a currently dominant way to understand the world and the self. The thesis thus deals with a historically grown (but also particular) way of making sense of the (modern) world and the (modern) self, which, strikingly, are often defined in educational ways – a­ fact that has led to the rise of the modern educational sciences with their theories and modern educational institutions with particular practices. In another context, I described this particular style of making sense of the world and the self linguistically as langue, as distinct from parole (Tröhler 2011; 2013a [Spanish translation]). In what follows, I will substantiate and also differentiate this general thesis about our educationalized world as a particular pattern, or even as our fundamental pattern, of making sense of the world, as a particular langue, but beforehand I would like to give a few more illustrative examples of the educational(ized) culture in which we are embedded. For instance, when American marine biologist Rachel Carson published Silent Spring (1962) some five years after Sputnik, warning of the devastating effects of indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture, this triggered a movement called Environmental education.2 It educationalized our behaviour toward nature, and this educationalization was expressed in many initiatives and activities, such as the erection of educational hiking trails teaching walkers about nature. Or, when, a few years later, the national crises during and after the Vietnam War, the oil crises in the 1970s, and the near collapse of the automobile industry in the early 1980s led in the United States to the perception of “a nation at risk” – ­an idea reflected in the title of a report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education (1983) – t­he conclusion was that there was an official need for a thorough reform of the American school – a­ n “imperative for educational reform,” as the subtitle of the same report put it. Similarly, in the Western World in gernal and in the United States in particular, rising teenage pregnancy rates in the 1960s led to an educationalization of sex through the introduction of sex education in schools, which gained new urgency with the linking of HIV/ AIDS to sexual behaviour in the 1980s. And when immigrant adolescents in the suburbs of Paris and Lyon protested violently in 2005, their behaviour was not seen primarily as a reaction to their poor living conditions or poor life chances but as an expression of the wrong education, as France’s prime minister Dominique de Villepin stated in 2005.3 These examples are all from the last six decades, and they are all from the West. However, it would be wrong to conclude that they are restricted to the last sixty years in the West, even though – a­ nd here is the substantiation of the thesis – ­educationalization of the world can in fact be interpreted as a Western, and more precisely as a Protestant, way to\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 29\n\ninterpret and to interact with the world and its (perceived) challenges and problems.4 Thereby – ­and here is the differentiation of the thesis – ­distinct Protestant trajectories in the educationalization of the world can be identified, and these distinct trajectories derive from competing dominant Protestant religions, most of all between the two Swiss Protestantisms on the one side – ­Calvinism and Zwinglianism (together often labelled as Reformed Protestantism) – a­ nd German Lutheranism (evangelical Protestantism) on the other. And here it seems that it is not so much the differences in theology in the narrower sense that played a crucial role between the Swiss and Luther5 but more the political dimensions of these two Protestantisms.6 In the balance of this chapter, in five steps I will present some evidence for the substantiated and differentiated thesis about the Protestant roots of our educationalized (Western) world and the cultural construction of the modern self and its distinct trajectories. First, I will identify specific transformations around 1700 that were almost predestined to trigger educational reactions in the Protestant regions. Second, I identify Protestant psychology (avant la lettre), or the Protestant conception of the soul, as the crucial principle allowing the educationalization of the challenges or problems that were detected with regard to these transformations. In a third step, I focus on the two different Protestantisms (reformed and evangelical), in particular with regard to their respective political theologies in order to (in step 4) identify the two paradigmatic educational ideologies that were becoming dominant towards 1800, culminating in the vision of Bildung on one side and the virtuous citizen on the other. Finally, I present my conclusions, also with regard to the fact that (of course) educationalization of the world is not restricted to Protestantism – ­not any more. Transformations around 1700 as Fundamental Challenges in Interpreting the World It is not unlikely that all historical periods could be honoured by being deemed crucial for development, all depending on what Jürgen Habermas called Erkenntnisinteresse (Habermas 1965). Erkenntnisinteresse can be translated as “knowledge interests” (or “recognitional interests”) that emerge within particular discourses and that structure history accordingly. In this context, the rise of education as a particular way to think about individuals or people, or even about humankind, and as a more and more institutionalized practice serving to implement these ideas and ideals, is often related to what historiography has honoured as the Age of Enlightenment. It is said that the Enlightenment resulted, among other things, in the\n\n30 Daniel Tröhler\n\ncreation of the modern sciences, in the emergence of modern education in the second half of the eighteenth century, and also in the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789. Interestingly enough, it is often claimed that the Age of Enlightenment ended with the French Revolution, after which the Enlightenment’s offspring, modern education and the republican form of government, seemed to prevail over the course of the next two centuries. In my analysis of the educationalization of the world I wish to draw attention first to a time period before the second half of the eighteenth century, that is, to the fifty to one hundred years before and after 1700, when the conditions seem to have emerged in which the cultural shift toward the educationalization of the world became possible – ­in particular in Protestant circles. It is during this period that important – ­but not educational! – ­­transformations occurred that were seen, at least in particular contexts, as challenges or problems for which education seemed to be more and more the proper answer. The theories expressing this educationalized culture or attitude became popular a good century later, at the end of the eighteenth century, and focused either on the education of the true human, as in the German (or Lutheran) case, expressing the idea of Bildung, or on the education of the virtuous citizen, as in the American or French, or the Swiss (or reformed Calvinist), way.7 The two transformations around 1700 that I want to highlight still affect us today, I believe. The first transformation concerned the way that people imagined history and past development and the future. The second concerned how people viewed the relation between money and politics. These two transformations replaced older perceptions and core notions that went back to the ancient world. The first (history and ­development/future) was initiated in France and the second (money and politics) in England. Together they created changes that were also perceived as challenges or “problems,” which were addressed in many ways, and the educational way advocated in particular contexts seems eventually to have been deemed the most promising, with effects up to today. The transformation in perceptions of history and development was initiated in France at the court of King Louis XIV at Versailles, when the ancients’ way of looking at things came under attack in the famous “quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.” Whereas up to the end of the seventeenth century, time, and thus history, had been seen, in analogy to the seasons, as an eternal cycle of events, around 1700 a linear way of thinking (“progress”) came to prevail that was oriented toward the future and in which outcomes were open. At first, around 1680, this\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 31\n\noptimism applied only to progress in the sciences, but, some decades later, progress was seen also as a social and political program: Humanity would develop progressively toward peace, justice, and bliss, and political conditions that impeded this progress had to be destroyed. This view – ­­legitimized by the theories of modern natural law, to which I return later – ­was the justification for the French Revolution of 1789. The second transformation has to do with the relation of money to politics, which changed toward the end of the seventeenth century, at first in England. The change was symbolized by the foundation of the Bank of England, which allowed rich people to invest in government. Up to that time, an ideal had prevailed in Europe according to which dispassionate reason was supposed to guide politics. At the same time, the commercial economy had been considered something lower or baser, because it was accused of diverting attention and interest away from the common good and of exposing people to the passionate pursuit of profit. In this system of thought, calm and rational governing was seen as good, and passion-driven money making as bad (Raab 1964; Hirschman 1977). But around 1700 and up to the present day, this system of thought became lost, not least because the commercial economy had become a social fact and actually very important for politics. This ideological bias – t­ he preference for dispassionate reason as a condition of good politics and the actual importance of the discredited commerce, connected to passions – h ­ ad to be solved in order to legitimate the systems of political power, which depended more and more on money. Like any other fundamental transformations, these two not only found enthusiastic supporters but also gave rise to existential uncertainty, critique, and debates; that is, these transformations were perceived as problems against the background of particular visions about the ideal social order. Several intellectual reactions can be detected, and the most sustainable among them seems to be the above-mentioned cultural shift toward educationalizing perceived problems in connection with this uncertain future that endangered the moral guidelines in interpreting the world and the self. The pivotal point of this cultural shift was the Protestant interpretation of the human soul and the dignity assigned to it.8 The Dignity of the Protestant Soul and Salvation This chapter is not the place to make a detailed, systematic analysis of Protestantism and Catholicism. The major differences between them with regard to the topic at hand is the fundamental Protestant principle\n\n32 Daniel Tröhler\n\nof Sola scriptura (by scripture alone), stating that God’s message of salvation is mediated through the Bible and is, most importantly, in no need of completion by any institutionalized tradition represented in Catholicism by the Holy Mother Church, the pope, and the ordained personnel of the church – i­ndeed, radically not.9 This principle of “by scripture alone” is complemented by a second, “by faith alone,” which is the idea that the sinfulness of human nature can be cured only by God’s will and not by confession, good works, veneration of relicts and saints, or the Mass. Faith in God is fundamental, and faithful reading of the Bible and praying means that the Holy Spirit will “talk” to the believer’s heart as the noblest part of the soul, with the individual’s soul being the place of salvation. This idea of the soul as the exclusive “place” or “space” of salvation – t­hat is, as the only possible way of saving the individual from sin and its consequences, a way that is in no need of any institutionalized mediation or institutionalized rituals such as confessions or indulgences as practices that are grounded in interactions between a lay person and an ordained dignitary – ­has proven to be an engine in the educationalization of the world.10 Based on this direct connection to God, people can develop the other part of the soul, which is human reason.11 In the course of, foremost, seventeenth-century theology, the pessimistic anthropology of the three founding “fathers” of Reformations was gradually replaced by a more optimistic interpretation that went along with the rising consciousness of progress, borne, if not exclusively, to the greatest extent by Protestant thinkers. Their visions of progress affected the sciences, socially useful knowledge, and the individual’s soul (Tröhler 2017). Hence, the (Protestant interpretation of the) soul became the object of educational desire and intervention, for it was here – ­and only from here – t­ hat salvation could be expected at all. With regard to the progress of the soul, the Lutheran theologian, ­philosopher, and lawyer Samuel von Pufendorf explained in his seminal work on natural law the connection between the human soul, human reason, and human dignity: “Man is of the highest dignity, b ­ ecause he has a soul, which is distinguished by the light of reason, by the ability to judge things and to decide freely, and that is familiar with many arts” (Pufendorf 1672, book II, ch. 1, p. 145).12 In this Protestant way of defining the dignity of humankind, the pivotal point is precisely the individual’s soul, and not institutionally the Holy Mother Church, as it would have been in Catholicism with its hierarchical construction of the world. This idiosyncratic Protestant idea was further developed by later scholars of the natural law theory – f­or example, by the Lutheran\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 33\n\ntheologian, philosopher, and lawyer Christian Wolff. In his fundamental work, Jus naturae methodo scientifica per tractatum (Natural Law, Treated According to the Scientific Method), Wolff confirmed human equality and dignity based on the fact that all “men” were created by (of course, the same) God and thus have a natural disposition of perfectibility – ­distinguishing them from all other beings on earth (Wolff 1746, § 759, p. 592).13 The French ideal behind the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, progression and perfection in the sciences, received here its inward – P ­ rotestant – ­counterpart. According to Wolff, inward perfectibility is an anthropological potential, as we might say today, and in principle independent of the degree to which particular individuals actually realize it in their life. Wolff therefore distinguishes an essential or natural perfectibility (perfectio essentialis) from an accidental state of the actual realization of perfectibility (perfectio accidentalis) that individuals may realize in their particular conditions of life (Wolff, 1739, Pars Prior, Part I, ch. 3, § 579, p. 530). Essential is the natural disposition, accidental the actual realization of this disposition in the life of the individual. Against this background, it becomes evident what – i­ n this Protestant context – e­ ducation could mean in its overall aspiration – ­namely, a contribution to the perfection of the soul, understood as redemption of the duty arising from the dignity of every Christian and as an individual act of salvation, an advancing to the image of God, uninfluenceable by any “external” conditions of change and seductive powers. The Imago Dei concept, therefore, had a strong influence not only on the Protestant idea of natural law (and subsequently on human rights), as elaborated by Pufendorf and Wolff, but also on the idea of individual perfection and morally right behaviour as a crucial part in conducting the right kind of life. Here it is not so much, as in the French context, the sciences, or learning and knowledge, that are deemed to be important but rather the virtue of the soul, the heart, and, connected with it, human reason, together forming the essence of true humanity, the mind (Geist). This almost inherent scepticism toward knowledge (called, disparagingly, Vielwisserei) was not only a shared conviction in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but was also a part of the Protestant discourse of those considered to be “enlightened,” such as the Lutheran theologian and philanthropist Carl Friedrich Bahrdt, who claimed that “masses of knowledge not only help nothing but are harmful” (1782, 627) – ­that is, they seduce the heart to “immorality,” as the son of a Lutheran pastor, Johann Melchior Gottlieb Beseke, feared in his reflection upon self-learning (1786, 364). It is no coincidence that Zwingli had already reminded educators of a passage from the Bible, Matthew 5:8: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God” ([1523] 1995b, 226).\n\n34 Daniel Tröhler\n\nThis principally inward conception of the Protestant soul, its dignity, and disposition to perfectibility, along with the two fundamental transitions discussed in the preceding section, already point to an explanation of why an educationalized culture could emerge during the long eighteenth century.14 However, the existence of two distinct, and quite ­opposite, theories of education around 1900 suggests that the story is a bit more complex. The difficulty arises from the two competing Protestantisms of the sixteenth century, and these two competing theories become even more complex by the fact that the Lutheran natural rights theories – ­written in awkward Latin – h ­ ad been translated into French by two Protestant French-Swiss philosophers and lawyers, Jean B ­ arbeyrac (1674–1744) and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694–1748) (Zurbuchen 1991, 88ff). Based on these translations and, in fact, interpretations, the French discussion became more acquainted especially with the idea of gradual progression toward an expectable state of perfectibility. This idea served Rousseau15 and the French lumières as the basis for the idea of progress as human perfectibility based on science and knowledge, formulated explicitly first by Turgot in the middle of the eighteenth century and then, more systematically, by his “disciple” Condorcet (Tröhler 2017). In the following discussion, however, I will focus only the two Protestant trajectories, ignoring the French development. Evangelical and Reformed Protestantism All the Protestant Reformers of the sixteenth century shared the fundamental principle of Sola scriptura and the idea that the process of salvation occurs in the heart of the faithful reader of the Bible. Yet what this salvation meant with regard to secular life was interpreted differently, and, accordingly, the educational ideologies that eventually emerged in the course of the seventeenth century – s­ haring the idea of perfecting the soul – ­were very different, too. The most famous difference between Luther and Zwingli was the question of the Lord’s Supper (Holy Communion, the Eucharist). Whereas Luther (and later the Lutherans) believed that the Eucharist allows the most profound experience of God’s manifested grace, for it is Christ’s actual Body and actual Blood that is being shared by the faithful during Holy Communion (Luther [1528] 1986, 190ff), Zwingli’s (and later the Zwinglians) differing view was that the Eucharist did not change the substance of the bread and wine but rather that it had symbolic, memorial power, reminding the faithful of the resurrected Christ. According to Zwingli, only faithful commemoration of Christ would make the resurrected Christ present; he talks about the\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 35\n\nVergegenwärtigung, or spiritual presence, not the Real Presence, of Christ in the Lord’s Supper (Zwingli [1523] 1995a, 171). Luther (like Catholics) seems to interpret the Eucharist in a metonymic way, in which Christ and the faithful are somehow unified, whereas Zwingli interprets it in a metaphoric way, in which the faithful, as individuals, are only reminded of communion with Christ, which strengthened their faith. These differences may point to other differences that are more important to this context – n ­ amely, the political dimension, the political counterpart, of these two Protestantisms: Luther’s evangelical and Zwingli’s Reformed Protestantism. Luther’s political theology was fundamentally dualistic and represents what later would be called the two kingdoms doctrine, which makes a sharp distinction between the kingdom of Christ and the secular kingdom. In Christ’s kingdom, which is governed by the spiritual authority of the Word and the Sacraments, there is grace and forgiveness of sins, and there are no differences among humankind. The secular kingdom is governed by the temporal authority of the ruler, the sword, and the law; there is neither grace nor equality. Lutherans view the two kingdoms, both instituted by God, as mutually beneficial. The realm of Christ benefits from the temporal realm, because secular authority enforces peace in the world, and the temporal realm is served by the realm of Christ in its proclaiming of the Gospel through the Word. This evangelical Protestantism holds further that it is of prime importance not to confuse the two kingdoms: God rules the spiritual kingdom through the Gospel. The Gospel is not meant to rule the secular kingdom, which is ruled by its own power, laws, and force. Any attempt to use the Gospel to rule the secular world is therefore an error. Politically, this doctrine – ­particularly since it was accompanied by a state church – ­was tantamount to total deprivation of people’s right of decision making. Freedom, in this tradition, is purely inward freedom, with no counterpart in the social-political realm of life.16 Here the difference between Luther and Zwingli becomes apparent. Influenced by emerging humanism, Zwingli’s political theory was what later was called a form of “civic humanism” (Baron 1955) or (classical) republicanism (Pocock 1975).17 According to this political ideology, citizens are free in principle and, by virtue of their freedom, they can act as law givers – ­and even as voters choosing their superiors. Zwingli questions the idea of hereditary monarchy and of a monarchy that has no consent of the people ([1523] 1995a, 393). Like Luther, Zwingli condemns revolts against those in power but not if – a­ nd this is in contrast to Luther – t­ he whole community wants to remove them, because in this case the “removal conforms to God’s will” (394). According to Zwingli, monarchy and, of course, tyranny are God’s punishments of\n\n36 Daniel Tröhler\n\npeople who do not live according to natural law. If they did so, says Zwingli, “We would be in no need of any superiors, for we would all be brothers ... Then we would all agree that Tyrants are to be removed” (394). (Morally) good people need a form of government but no tyrants. Hence, this form of government is participatory; it is self-government. Zwingli’s classical-republican legitimation of tyrannicide18 was sharply attacked by Luther, who did not hide his low esteem of ­Zwingli’s political idea of self-government and, with it, the justification for tyrannicide (which became famous worldwide with ­Friedrich Schiller’s drama William Tell and was further popularized by the ­opera of the same title by Gioachino Rossini). Luther unconditionally ­defended the right of monarchs, even if they were unjust in ruling over their subjects. Zwingli’s intention to work toward worldly – ­that is, political and social – ­reform led Luther to make the accusation that Zwingli’s republicanism presumed to “scorn everyone, including the princes and potentates.” Luther defended the system of state sovereigns and gave civic humanism or classical republicanism no chances: “It is ... said that the Swiss have in the past killed their lords and in this way won their freedom ... Up to now the Swiss have paid in blood for this dearly and are still paying dearly; how this will end is easy to imagine ... I do not see any type of government to be as enduring as the one in which authorities are esteemed and venerated” (cited in Farner 1931, 18–20). To Luther it was evident that Zwingli would either cause or suffer damage (21). It is foremost these political differences that led to different trajectories in formulating educational theories. While both theories focused equally on the individual’s soul, one centred on fostering an inward free, true human, culminating in the ideal of Bildung, and the other a self-governed virtuous citizen. Bildung and the Education of the Virtuous Citizen Both Protestantisms relied on the principle of Sola scriptura and the idea that the salvation process would occur in the faithful soul of the individual while praying and reading the Bible, and both would agree that challenges in the world should be responded to by education, understood primarily as perfecting the soul. Where they differed was regarding the social and political dimension of the individual and, accordingly, the idea of how education should be theoretically legitimized. Within the somewhat apolitical realm of Lutheranism, the doctrine of human perfectibility became translated, toward the end of the eighteenth century, into the theory of Bildung as total inward perfection of\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 37\n\nhumankind, to which, as Humboldt said, every single individual is called upon to strive. Bildung meant inward perfection, understood as aesthetic harmonization of the soul. The “outer” counterpart was not the state or the idea of the republic but either the cosmopolitan vision of humanity in general (Menschheit) or, in the case of Fichte and others, the German nation and its mission for humankind. The Germans deliberately leveraged the concept of Bildung as a means of distancing themselves from the French idea of civilization – ­an idea the Germans criticized as centralist, courtly, alienated, and morally suspect – ­claiming, in contrast, that “culture” (Kultur) and Bildung were uniquely German and, in truth, superior to French ideas (Horlacher 2016). The curriculum at school therefore focused not so much on the empirical world and the sciences or mathematics but more on the ancient world of the Greeks and Romans, and the “methods” to convert or perfect the souls of the young individuals resided in the school subjects of Latin and Greek and, in higher education, hermeneutics. Hence, antiquity was much more than a mere object of study; it was the embodiment of an ideal. One of the first proponents of this enthusiasm was Johann Joachim Winckelmann, a German art historian and archaeologist who, in Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks ([1755] 1765) emphasized the value of Greek aesthetics for the human mind (Horlacher 2016). ­Wilhelm von Humboldt, one of the founders of the German Bildungstheorie, confirmed that the Greeks were “a model, and its unattainability may encourage” us to follow them ([1807] 1961, 70). This aesthetic harmony was defined as a means for true education of the human ­being: “The true purpose of man – n ­ ot the one that changing inclinations prescribe but the eternally unchanging reason – i­s the highest and harmonious Bildung of his potentials/powers to one whole” (Humboldt [1792] 1960, 64). “Perfection is not limited” (Humboldt [1797] 1960, 512) and represents the “inward spiritual vitality” (513). Bildung, Humboldt says, is to be found only “in oneself” (507, freely translated). Expressed in the school curriculum, this idea sharply separates education (Bildung) from any kind of vocational training (Ausbildung). “All schools” of the state may “only focus on general Bildung of the human character,” and any educational concern connected to the needs of living must be separated from it (Humboldt [1809] 1964, 188). Any kind of useful training has to be postponed to the stage when every human being has been educated first as a human character. General Bildung has to empower, purify, and compose human forces in order to perfect the human mind/ mental disposition (Gemüt) (188). Again, the Greeks seem to be the model that was to be learned by every individual: “In this way, having learned Greek would be just as useful for the carpenter as would carpentry for\n\n38 Daniel Tröhler\n\nthe scholar” (189). Education in the sense of Bildung was designed to compensate for Germany’s self-perceived political and scientific backwardness as compared to France or England (Horlacher 2016) and to bring an idea into play that claimed the highest dignity and expressed Germany’s global mission. Bildung became the epitome of the defiant self-confidence with which German intellectuals reacted to the scientific and political – ­that is, in their eyes, “only” outer – p ­ rogress in France and in England. It held that, in contrast, true progress is inward and is not directly related to knowledge and politics. This idea differed essentially from the Swiss Protestant idea of education as “making” the classical virtuous, patriotic citizen. Already Zwingli had claimed, in the context of his classical republicanism, that education meant educating the soul toward a kind of moral resilience or, more traditionally, steadfast virtue (feste Tugend) ([1523] 1995b, 229). In the course of the economization of social life, this steadfast virtue – o ­ nce indicating the steadfast soldier-citizen defending his hometown on the battlefield – c­ ame to mean resistance to the seductions of commercial life, luxury, and passion for the private good (instead of the common good). Whereas the more radical exponents of this educational theory in the eighteenth century aimed at banning the commercial way of life altogether by fostering republican virtuous socialization – ­as did Rousseau in Letter to d’Alembert (1759) or Considerations on the Government of Poland ([1782] 2005), Mably in Entretiens de Phocion (1763), and the young Pestalozzi – ­it became more and more clear that these virtuous citizens first had to be made if they wanted to conserve their political-ethical ideals in a changing world. Pestalozzi became the icon of this new educationalized ideology, not least because he often used Lutheran language in promoting his republican aspirations (Tröhler 2013b; 2014b). The aim was to meet the challenges of the modernizing world by making the inwardly steadfast citizen patriotic, selfless, and immune to the temptations of political power and commerce. The core educational idea was to accept commercial professions other than only the favoured profession of agriculture, precisely by training the soul to be indifferent to the temptations of power and money. Against that background, there was no reason why a tradesman could not be virtuous, as the German translator of Gabriel Bonnot de Mably, Hans Conrad Vögelin from Zürich, suggested in a footnote to M ­ ably’s republican treaties Entretiens de Phocion (Phocion’s Conversations) ­(Mably 1763) in his translation published in 1764: “Why should they not be industrious and moderate, why should they not be able to have a desire for fame and religion?” And opposing the opinion that agriculture was a considerably more\n\nThe Dignity of Protestant Souls 39\n\nfavourable basis for the republic than the trades, Vögelin asked critically, “What then is especially virtuous about the plow, more so than the hammer of the blacksmith?” Regarding the classical republican criticism of tradesmen, Vögelin concluded his remarks that those of the nobility are good, tradesmen are good, and commerce is also good, as long as it can be “correctly modified” (Vögelin note, in Mably 1764, 111). This idea of modifying, or making virtuous, was interpreted by Vögelin as i­nner strengthening – ­that is, as strengthening the soul. It is evident that the school curriculum associated with this educational ideology was different from the curriculum in the Lutheran context; it served ideas of equality more, placing less emphasis on the aesthetic idealization of antiquity and more on history and useful or practical sciences. The R ­ eformed Protestant inner strength was the alternative equivalent to the Lutheran aesthetic harmony of the soul as an answer to the challenges of the world. Both conceptions were holistic: Bildung as the"
