This is about the process around the salary level,” Mr Carthy told the Irish Examiner.\n\nAmid controversy at the time of his appointment over how the salary was agreed upon, Mr Watt temporarily waived the €81,000 top-up, but there is confusion as to whether that waiver is still in place.\n\nMr Carthy, a member of the Dáil’s public accounts committee, sought to question Mr Watt on this issue when the official appeared as a witness recently, but did not receive a response.\n\nContacted by the Irish Examiner, a spokesman for the Minister for Health said he was not aware whether the added portion of salary is still being waived. “That is a matter for the secretary general,” he said.\n\nThe Irish Examiner sought comment directly from Mr Watt, but none was forthcoming.\n\nPublic Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath said a revised salary of €292,000 was sanctioned for recruitment to the post of the secretary general of the Department of Health, reflecting the challenges and very significant responsibilities attached to this role.\n\nHe confirmed that, under the terms of the latest public pay deal, the rate for the post in the Department of Health with effect from October 1, 2021, is €294,920.\n\n“Section 3.1.3 of ‘Building Momentum: A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022’ provided for a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or €500, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2021,” Mr McGrath said.\n\nThe decision to pay Mr Watt the higher salary in effect created a fourth tier of secretaries general.\n\nHe is the only secretary general to be paid at that higher rate at present, but there are concerns others will seek a similar pay rise.\n\nSince October, the salary rate for secretary general level I and level II is €213,859, and the rate for secretary general level III is €202,604.\n\n“The payscale is not justified, so to suggest he is entitled to a €3,000 pay increase is simply not acceptable. “This was an obscure process with no logical explanation,” said Mr Carthy, adding regarding the waiver, “it is spectacular that information is not available”.\n\nhttps://www.irishexaminer.com/news/politics/arid-40791576.html\n\n===================================\n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT: These are taken from an American website but no harm to have a read after what happened recently in Tullamore: 1. If walking by yourself, get off your cell phone. A lot of people think that being on the phone is safe because the person on the other line can call 999, but that rarely works out. Chatting can distract you; it’s better to be aware of your surroundings. I see people listening to music while walking – they have to be distracted and not aware of where they are.\n\n2. If walking by yourself, hold your cell phone and be ready to make an emergency call. Many phones now have a button on the screen to dial 999 immediately. Go one step further and preset one of the buttons on your phone to call the emergency number.\n\n4. If you return to your car and see that a van is parked right next to the driver’s side, enter through the passenger side. Predators often use vans and will disguise it as a family car, even using “Baby on Board” decals.\n\n5. You return to your car and it has a flat tire. Back away. Return to wherever you came from (restaurant, store, etc) and call for help. Once assistance arrives, approach your car. If someone comes up to you (even if they are a woman) and wants to offer help, politely say, “No thank you.” If a man, he could be a predator. If a woman, she could be the lurer.\n\n6. When leaving the mall late at night, ask a security guard to walk you to your car. Do not go up to just any security guard. Go directly to the kiosk and ask for them to assign an officer to escort you. Predators sometimes dress up like men of the law.\n\n7. When the pharmacist asks you to confirm your home address, whisper it to them. Broadcasting your home address among strangers on the line could compromise your safety.\n\n8. Ditto if you’re checking in to a hotel room. If the person at the front desk says your room number out loud, ask them to give you a new room and write the number on a piece of paper. Or when you check-in, ask upfront that they not say your room number out loud. Your room number should be your business only.\n\n9. Before entering your hotel room, make sure no one is lingering in the hallway.\n\n10. Always immediately lock your hotel room door after you enter.\n\n11. When traveling, do not walk with your map in your hand. It is a dead giveaway that you are a tourist. Therefore, you are an easy target.\n\n12. If you call for room service, and you get a knock on your door, do not immediately open. Ask: “Who is it?” Make the person on the other side of the door tell you who they are before you open it.\n\nAdvertisement – Continue Reading Below\n\n13. When asking for directions and someone offers to show you the way by having you follow them, do not go. Just ask for them to point you in the right direction. Often, predators just want to get you to a place less crowded where your screams can’t be heard.\n\n14. If someone tries to grab you, twist your arm up and down and yell, “Stop!” Do anything you can to draw attention to yourself.\n\n15. Always pour your own drink at a party and bring it with you everywhere…even to the bathroom. This will make it a lot harder for someone to drug you via you drink.\n\n16. Watch the bartender as he or she pours your drink. To be extra safe, drink wine instead of a cocktail. Mixed drinks take longer to make. You could be easily distracted and miss the bartender (who could be working with the predator) or someone else slipping something into your drink.\n\n17. When going out with your girlfriends, decide beforehand that you will stick together. Do not let your friend go off alone with a guy.\n\n18. Don’t put your name on your apartment buzzer. If you’re expecting guests, just let them know which number to push. This way, only people who know you know exactly where you live. If you are 65, you live alone or with a person/s aged over 65 you are entitled to receive a monitored alarm system. But if you have younger people living in the house who are out or if you spend long periods of the day on your own then, because you are spending hours alone you are also entitled to the system provided that you are over 65. The free equipment is provided by Pobal following an application from Community Alert, there will be a monitoring fee to be paid from the second year of installation to the installing company of €72. There may be some confusion over the word free – the equipment which costs in the region of €400 is provided free of charge by Pobal as is the first year of monitoring but after that you will be charged by the installing company for the monitoring.\n\n==========================================\n\nPrayer composed by St. Francis de Sales:\n\nGlorious St. Joseph, Spouse of Mary, grant us thy paternal protection, we beseech thee, by the Heart of Jesus Christ.

I observed early on that musicians became absorbed into the music and seemed to inhabit a world of their own when they played. I was captivated by this as a child, my father Joe played for us as children at home, other family members and musical acquaintances of his would all play together on visits to our home. As children we were their enraptured audience, this experience drew me in – it was like magic happening before me–a feast for my eyes and ears. I learned how to listen, then I learned to play from listening and being around it. This is where I began my journey as a musician. My photography takes the viewer into this intimate space.\n\nTraditional music is rooted in place—it was carried by families like mine who were musicians, singers, dancers and story tellers and in communities like County Clare are a stronghold and a cradle.\n\nThe images here are used as a way of telling a personal story of home of family and community—its a beginning and also an end. A place and its music are in some ways inseparable.\n\nMy book “The Living Note”, with the writer Peter Woods, celebrates this.\n\nI began this work more than 30 years ago as a matter of urgency. This older way of life was still in existence when I began the work, wanting to document it before it disappeared. Many of the people captured here are now dead and gone. A Celtic tiger economy has come and gone and much change has happened in its wake, even so, the music is healthy and alive. The memory of those who carried the tunes, songs and stories all preserved with the music—passed on to the next generation\n\nThis is a view from within.\n\n=================================\n\nBealtaine\n\nThe Job of Songs\n\nBEALTAINE\n\nA collaboration with writer Niall Williams. Niall Williams’ novel, This is Happiness, was one of the great literary successes of 2019. Set in Co Clare during the time of rural electrification, it is a musical, evocative, rhapsodic and deeply moving work. Two of the main characters in the novel go on a quest to find the legendary (real life) fiddle player Junior Crehan. Bealtaine presents an evening of words and music with Niall Williams reading from his novel accompanied by East Clare virtuoso musician, Christy McNamara (accordion & concertina).\n\n================================\n\nStory Tellers of Ireland\n\nTwo Shorten the Road / Giorraíonn beirt bóthar\n\nEamon Kelly\n\nHome Documents Eamon Kelly\n\nHe experienced neighbourhood storytelling from an early age and described his carpenter father’s house as being a Rambling House, the local venue for the art of the storyteller in recent centuries. For those who thrilled to his radio and TV storytelling Eamon was the epitome of the seanchaí. There is an inaccuracy here. The term seanchaí described the communal bearer of multi-faceted traditional lore (seanchas). Eamon himself pointed out that he wasn’t a seanchaí – but ‘played the part’ of a seanchaí. Indeed, to be more accurate, he was more of a scéalaí (storyteller) – one of the several functions of the seanchaí. Given the nature of late 20th century Irish society it is questionable if the term seanchaí can now be applied to more than a few. (Some individuals like Paddy Lowry and Paddy Heany in the Slieve Bloom area may well approach that status.) It would certainly be inaccurate to give the term to most modern professional storytellers, given the fact that the traditional seanchaí was defined by the local audience to whom he (and it was usually a ‘he’) imparted his lore.\n\nIt is ironic that the technology that did most to displace the traditional seanchaí – radio and television – was the same technology which bestowed the mantle of national popularity upon Eamon as a storyteller.\n\nBy the mid 1950’s the Rural Electrification project (begun in 1946) was changing the economic, social and cultural face of Ireland and around this time Radio Éireann began to devise entertainment programmes that approximated, on air, the ‘rambling house’, or ‘ceidhlí house’ format. The hugely popular Take The Floor, which was presented by Din Joe, and famously featured, for the first time, ‘dancing on the radio’ (not as daft as it sounds) began to feature Eamon in storyteller spots. He also guested on Ceidhlí House Tonight, which featured Séan Ó Riada and his groundbreaking musical group Ceoltóirí Chualann. This led to Miceál Ó hAodha giving Eamon his own programme, The Rambling House. While still a member of the Radio Repertory Company, he began to moonlight with some of the Ceidhlí House cast and present a version of the show in venues throughout the country. This new milieu, no doubt, occasioned a different kind of timing in response to the live reactions. Then, with the advent of the national television station, Eamon was featured telling tales for younger viewers.\n\nHe had been pointed to traditional tales by Sean Ó Súillabháin of the Department of Folklore, in University College Dublin. He regularly visited the Gougane Barra region in West Cork to pick up tales and his fast developing repertoire was swelled by stories posted to him by his listeners. He notes that the source of one of his signature stories, The Looking Glass, was a traditional Chinese tale.\n\nThomás Mac Anna of the Abbey devised with Eamon a full-scale stage entertainment in Irish, featuring dramatised stories, music, mime, song, and dance under the title Scéal Scéalaí.\n\nEamon went on to bring his storytelling persona to the stage in a series of seven one-man shows – In My Father’s Time, The Story Goes, A Rogue of Low Degree, Bless Me Father, Your Humble Servant, The Rub Of A Relic and English That For Me (several of which he played in London and the U.S.) He christened this form of entertainment “theatre of the hearthstone.”(1) The move from a fireside seat to the stage called for a more active style of telling, one which he achieved with a mastery of ease that did not over-theatricalise the conversational integrity of his tales. Stories from these shows were published by Mercier Press and most of them are included in Ireland’s Master Storyteller: The Collected Stories of Eamon Kelly (1998). (2)\n\nThere was an essentially retrospective air of the revival to these presentations. As he said:\n\nSetting those stories in the past is a convention, as far as I’m concerned. And it also helps me to colour in all the things, because I’m drawing from the experiences of my own childhood.\n\nIt might be noted that Eamon’s early embodiment of the seanchaí had him playing the character as an old man, while the vocal texture of his telling changed over the years to more resemble his own natural voice. In a further irony, it is still common to find at rural folk festivals a young boy recycling Eamon’s repertoire, dressed for the part in a suit, waistcoat and (junior-sized) iconic hat.\n\nAn immaculate literary craft went into the assembling of his material (in this he resembled the great Armagh storyteller John Campbell.) Indeed the fine tuning of these stories reminds one of his background in carpentry and woodworking. One is reminded of the view expressed by the German thinker Walter Benjamin in his seminal essay, The Storyteller (Der Erzahler) (1936) when he says:\n\nA great storyteller will always be rooted in the people, primarily in a milieu of craftsmen.\n\nAn essential function and impulse of the Tradition Bearer is to impart knowledge of the various crafts of the tradesman or farmer – a precise instruction on the traditional working technique. A story of Eamon’s like The Cat and the Splinter is less focused on the amusing anecdote it finishes with, but more essentially on the ‘how to’ of making a primitive light source from a bog deal splinter, a candle or a rush light. (The stories of John Campbell also often took a delight in the traditional crafts and passing on ‘how to do the job properly’.)\n\nTwo theatrical productions to which Eamon was central drew much on the storytelling style – Stone Mad and The Tailor and Ansty (both of which, incidentally, bring together the ideas of a manual craft and storytelling). Miceál Ó hAodha, commenting on his artistry, said:\n\nHe is one of that rare and disappearing breed of men who, to paraphrase F.R. Higgins, could rib a ship or turn the secret joinery of song and story.\n\nAn essential ingredient of Eamon’s art was a delight in the twists and turns of his native Kerry dialect. As he himself said of the Tailor Buckley:\n\nHe brought much of the rhythm and music of the Irish language to English.\n\nHis fellow Kerryman, the playwright John B. Keane, memorably described Eamon in full flight:\n\nHe can take a word or phrase and swing it in front of you like a hypnotist’s pendulum so that he captivates you … It’s a magician’s art.\n\nBut perhaps central to Eamon’s style was his always teasing sense of humour. Reflecting on the peasant audience for storytelling in the past, he said:\n\nThey were people who really had it very hard to live and they were dispossessed in many ways. And what saved them was the sense of humour, the sense of the ridiculous.\n\nA typical example of his humour can be found in his version of the children’s Fianna tale, The Giant From Scotland, in which hesays:\n\nThere was great trouble in the world that time too. Wars and rumours of wars, and giants came from Greece to fight the Fianna but if they did they were quiet men going home.\n\nOther publications of his include two collections of tales for children: The Bridge of Feathers and The Enchanted Cake; his two-part autobiography (again invoking the craftsman-like nature of his trade): The Apprentice and The Journeyman.\n\nHis last public performance was at the Courtmacsherry Storytelling Festival in September 2001. He passed away six weeks later on October the 24th and is buried in Fingal cemetery.\n\nIn 2004 the Storytellers of Ireland Irish Storytelling Handbook was dedicated to Eamon and the late Alice Kane.\n\nLet’s finish with examples of a few of the traditional closing ‘tags’ or codas that Eamon delighted in.\n\nSo put a sod on the fire, give an apple to the child and pour a drink for the storyteller.\n\nOr this one, which he favoured (and had adapted from a tag collected by Seamus Delargy in 1935 from a Galway teller, Éamonn á Búrc):\n\nThey went the lower road, I came the high road, they crossed over the stepping stones and I came by the bridge, they were drowned and I was saved and all I ever got for my storytelling was shoes of brown paper and stockings of thick milk. I only know what I heard, I only heard what was said and a lot of what was said was made up to pass the night away!\n\n(1) Folklore was central to the style of ‘peasant plays’ which became the signature contribution of the Abbey to world theatre. The first Irish language play ever presented in a proper theatre was Casadh an tSúgáin (The Twisting of the Rope), a one-act comedy by Douglas Hyde. Hyde was a founder of the Gaelic League in 1893 and a committed and notable collector of folklore. (He later went on to be the first president of the independent state) Casadh an tSúgain was based on a theme from folklore where a poetic stranger enters a community with dramatic consequences. It was presented as part of a double bill in 1901 with Diarmuid and Grania by W.B.Yeats and George Moore for the Irish Literary Theatre, a fore-runner of the Abbey. Reviewing Hyde’s play for a Paris magazine, L’Européen, J. M. Synge immediately glimpsed the significance of the work. It was to trigger his own creation of a folk theatre and he was to use variants of the same theme in two of his later masterpieces, The Shadow of the Glen (1903) and The Playboy of the Western World (1907).\n\n(2) Amongst his papers held in the National Library of Ireland are124 stories, compiled by Éilís Ní Dhuibhne, many of them classified using the Arne-Thompson international folktale classification.\n\nhttp://www.storytellersofireland.org/documents/eamon-kelly/\n\n====================================\n\nThe agriculture on cleared forested land is dominated by pastoral beef production where around 4.76-6.99kg of protein per hectare per year is produced. But, if this system was replaced with planting trees hosting the milk cap fungus, the same parcel of land could produce 7.31kg of protein every year. The mushrooms can be consumed fresh, processed or the protein content can be extracted to produce other food items.\n\nThis would lead to more food production, with all the benefits forests bring and without the environmental burdens of intensive farming such as fertiliser, water use or the growing of additional feed.\n\nhttps://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-a-humble-mushroom-could-save-forests-and-fight-climate-change?utm_source=pocket-newtab-global-en-GB\n\n==============================================\n\nby durrushistory\n\n1907, Evidence of Councillor Ned Roycroft, Mount Gabriel Schull to The Royal Commission On Congestion in Ireland.

I figured I could make it through a couple of weeks, maybe even a couple of months (!), of quarantine-life if I stayed busy with projects. I kept up with a daily planner, hosted elaborate virtual parties, experimented in the kitchen, spent time praying daily, and trained for a half-marathon. I was going to “pass” the lockdown life with flying colors!\n\nThe half-marathon I had signed up for was pivoted into a “virtual” race, which meant I could map out my own 13.1-mile course that started and ended at my house. On the day of the race, I encountered the usual jitters I get as I doubted my abilities to complete the long run. I had assembled a playlist that I was particularly excited about, and it was a perfect spring morning, so I persisted through my anxieties and started my run.\n\nIt was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, my playlist was inspiring, and friends and family cheered me on along the way. Then, about 12 miles in — the point when I always rely on music to carry me through — my playlist abruptly ended.\n\nAfter a brief moment of panic, I felt inspired to repeat a song I’d recently discovered, “Brand New,” by Ben Rector. When the song had played earlier in my run, I’d been surprised to find myself getting choked up. I had pushed past the emotions the first time, but now I was curious why it had felt so significant.\n\nAs I focused on finishing the race, I suddenly found myself transported to what I can only describe as a prayerful, euphoric, “mountaintop” experience. I struggle now to find the words to describe it, but I knew in my bones that God was sharing his unconditional love with me directly through that song. Some might chalk up what I was feeling to a “runner’s high,” but I have experienced that exercise-driven adrenaline rush before, and I can tell you this was significantly different.\n\n================\n\nAPOSTOLIC JOURNEY TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n(SEPTEMBER 16-19, 2010)\n\nMASS WITH THE BEATIFICATION\n\nOF VENERABLE CARDINAL JOHN HENRY NEWMAN\n\nHOMILY OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI\n\nCofton Park of Rednal – Birmingham\n\nSunday, 19 September 2010\n\n(Video)\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nThis day that has brought us together here in Birmingham is a most auspicious one. In the first place, it is the Lord’s day, Sunday, the day when our Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and changed the course of human history for ever, offering new life and hope to all who live in darkness and in the shadow of death. That is why Christians all over the world come together on this day to give praise and thanks to God for the great marvels he has worked for us. This particular Sunday also marks a significant moment in the life of the British nation, as it is the day chosen to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the Battle of Britain. For me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the Nazi regime in Germany, it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion, and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives, courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology. My thoughts go in particular to nearby Coventry, which suffered such heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in November 1940. Seventy years later, we recall with shame and horror the dreadful toll of death and destruction that war brings in its wake, and we renew our resolve to work for peace and reconciliation wherever the threat of conflict looms. Yet there is another, more joyful reason why this is an auspicious day for Great Britain, for the Midlands, for Birmingham. It is the day that sees Cardinal John Henry Newman formally raised to the altars and declared Blessed.\n\nI thank Archbishop Bernard Longley for his gracious welcome at the start of Mass this morning. I pay tribute to all who have worked so hard over many years to promote the cause of Cardinal Newman, including the Fathers of the Birmingham Oratory and the members of the Spiritual Family Das Werk. And I greet everyone here from Great Britain, Ireland, and further afield; I thank you for your presence at this celebration, in which we give glory and praise to God for the heroic virtue of a saintly Englishman.\n\nEngland has a long tradition of martyr saints, whose courageous witness has sustained and inspired the Catholic community here for centuries. Yet it is right and fitting that we should recognize today the holiness of a confessor, a son of this nation who, while not called to shed his blood for the Lord, nevertheless bore eloquent witness to him in the course of a long life devoted to the priestly ministry, and especially to preaching, teaching, and writing. He is worthy to take his place in a long line of saints and scholars from these islands, Saint Bede, Saint Hilda, Saint Aelred, Blessed Duns Scotus, to name but a few. In Blessed John Henry, that tradition of gentle scholarship, deep human wisdom and profound love for the Lord has borne rich fruit, as a sign of the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit deep within the heart of God’s people, bringing forth abundant gifts of holiness.\n\nCardinal Newman’s motto, Cor ad cor loquitur, or “Heart speaks unto heart”, gives us an insight into his understanding of the Christian life as a call to holiness, experienced as the profound desire of the human heart to enter into intimate communion with the Heart of God. He reminds us that faithfulness to prayer gradually transforms us into the divine likeness. As he wrote in one of his many fine sermons, “a habit of prayer, the practice of turning to God and the unseen world in every season, in every place, in every emergency – prayer, I say, has what may be called a natural effect in spiritualizing and elevating the soul. A man is no longer what he was before; gradually … he has imbibed a new set of ideas, and become imbued with fresh principles” (Parochial and Plain Sermons, iv, 230-231). Today’s Gospel tells us that no one can be the servant of two masters (cf. Lk 16:13), and Blessed John Henry’s teaching on prayer explains how the faithful Christian is definitively taken into the service of the one true Master, who alone has a claim to our unconditional devotion (cf. Mt 23:10). Newman helps us to understand what this means for our daily lives: he tells us that our divine Master has assigned a specific task to each one of us, a “definite service”, committed uniquely to every single person: “I have my mission”, he wrote, “I am a link in a chain, a bond of connexion between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good, I shall do his work; I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place … if I do but keep his commandments and serve him in my calling” (Meditations and Devotions, 301-2).\n\nThe definite service to which Blessed John Henry was called involved applying his keen intellect and his prolific pen to many of the most pressing “subjects of the day”. His insights into the relationship between faith and reason, into the vital place of revealed religion in civilized society, and into the need for a broadly-based and wide-ranging approach to education were not only of profound importance for Victorian England, but continue today to inspire and enlighten many all over the world. I would like to pay particular tribute to his vision for education, which has done so much to shape the ethos that is the driving force behind Catholic schools and colleges today. Firmly opposed to any reductive or utilitarian approach, he sought to achieve an educational environment in which intellectual training, moral discipline and religious commitment would come together. The project to found a Catholic University in Ireland provided him with an opportunity to develop his ideas on the subject, and the collection of discourses that he published as The Idea of a University holds up an ideal from which all those engaged in academic formation can continue to learn. And indeed, what better goal could teachers of religion set themselves than Blessed John Henry’s famous appeal for an intelligent, well-instructed laity: “I want a laity, not arrogant, not rash in speech, not disputatious, but men who know their religion, who enter into it, who know just where they stand, who know what they hold and what they do not, who know their creed so well that they can give an account of it, who know so much of history that they can defend it” (The Present Position of Catholics in England, ix, 390). On this day when the author of those words is raised to the altars, I pray that, through his intercession and example, all who are engaged in the task of teaching and catechesis will be inspired to greater effort by the vision he so clearly sets before us.\n\nWhile it is John Henry Newman’s intellectual legacy that has understandably received most attention in the vast literature devoted to his life and work, I prefer on this occasion to conclude with a brief reflection on his life as a priest, a pastor of souls. The warmth and humanity underlying his appreciation of the pastoral ministry is beautifully expressed in another of his famous sermons: “Had Angels been your priests, my brethren, they could not have condoled with you, sympathized with you, have had compassion on you, felt tenderly for you, and made allowances for you, as we can; they could not have been your patterns and guides, and have led you on from your old selves into a new life, as they can who come from the midst of you” (“Men, not Angels: the Priests of the Gospel”, Discourses to Mixed Congregations, 3). He lived out that profoundly human vision of priestly ministry in his devoted care for the people of Birmingham during the years that he spent at the Oratory he founded, visiting the sick and the poor, comforting the bereaved, caring for those in prison. No wonder that on his death so many thousands of people lined the local streets as his body was taken to its place of burial not half a mile from here. One hundred and twenty years later, great crowds have assembled once again to rejoice in the Church’s solemn recognition of the outstanding holiness of this much-loved father of souls. What better way to express the joy of this moment than by turning to our heavenly Father in heartfelt thanksgiving, praying in the words that Blessed John Henry Newman placed on the lips of the choirs of angels in heaven:\n\nPraise to the Holiest in the height\n\nAnd in the depth be praise;\n\nIn all his words most wonderful,\n\nMost sure in all his ways!\n\n(The Dream of Gerontius).\n\n© Copyright 2010 – Libreria Editrice Vaticana\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100919_beatif-newman.html\n\n============================================================\n\nThe Presbytery, Abbeydorney. (066 7135146)\n\nabbeydorney@dioceseofkerry.ie\n\n13th February 2022, 6th Sunday in Ordinary Time.\n\nDear Parishioner,\n\nHave you ever heard of ‘Little Nellie of Holy God’? That is\n\nthe popular name for a Cork girl, called Ellen Organ, who was born in 1903\n\nand died in 1908. She was the youngest of four children born to William\n\nOrgan and his wife, Mary Ahern. Mary died of TB in 1907, when the family\n\nresided in the military fort in Spike Island, where William was soldiering.\n\nFollowing the mother’s death, the children were taken into care. Nellie\n\nwas placed in the orphanage, run by the Good Shepherd Sisters, in Sunday’s\n\nWell in Cork. The child was delicate and suffered physical impairment, due\n\nto a fall in infancy. As result, most of her days with the Sisters were spent\n\nin the infirmary. Yet, Nellie, not yet four years old, was a happy cheerful,\n\nuncomplaining little girl.\n\nThe Sisters soon observed that Nellie had an exceptional spiritual and\n\nprayerful attitude of mind. She loved the chapel, “the home of Holy God”.\n\nThe statues, the tabernacle and the stations of the Cross intrigued her. The\n\nstory of the Passion of Christ drew a tearful response – “poor Holy God, poor\n\nHoly God” – and, after her carer went to Holy Communion, Nellie asked her\n\nfor a kiss on the lips, as a sort of spiritual communion because she loved\n\nJesus in the “lock-up”. Having visited her in Sunday’s Well, the bishop of\n\nCork attested to her holiness and had her confirmed. Nellie would not\n\nqualify for Holy Communion for another six years but, having waived all\n\nthe technicalities, the bishop ensured that the saintly little invalid would\n\nhave Holy Communion. The story of Little Nellie of Holy God so impressed\n\nPope Pius X that it influenced his decision on the appropriate age for First\n\nHoly Communion, and he might have canonised her but for death overtaking\n\nhimself.

Denis O’Mahony\n\n————————–\n\nA Church Of Service What Is Needed Is A Church Of Service Rather Than\n\nJust A Church Of Services By Peter McVerry\n\nThe only thing we can say with certainty about the Church of the future is\n\nthat it will be totally different from the Church we are familiar with today.\n\nContext: The Church does not exist for itself. It exists only to continue the\n\nmission of Jesus. How we see the Church of tomorrow depends on how we\n\nunderstand its mission. We could define that mission in this way: it is to\n\nreveal to the world the God that Jesus revealed, namely the God of com-\n\npassion. Jesus healed the sick, ate with sinners, and was a friend and com-\n\npanion to the poor. We, the community called Church, can only reveal the\n\nGod of compassion by being the compassion of God to others, particularly,\n\nlike Jesus, to the poor, the vulnerable and the marginalised. Alternatively,\n\nwe could define its mission in the prayer that Jesus himself gave us, “Thy\n\nkingdom come ….on earth, as it is in heaven.” In heaven, God’s will is always\n\ndone, and so it should be on earth.\n\nThese two ways of defining the mission of the church are actually identical.\n\nChurch As People Of God: Those who wish to become members of the\n\nChurch, then, must commit themselves to a service of the poor and needy,\n\nthereby building the Kingdom of God on earth and revealing the God of com-\n\npassion to the world. Hence, I would abolish infant baptism and only baptise\n\nthose who are able, and willing, to make such a commitment. Infant baptism\n\ncomes from an outdated theology that says infants who die without baptism\n\nwill not go to heaven. The Church of the future, then, would be much\n\nsmaller and with an unwavering concern for those on the margins of soci-\n\nety, and so it would probably be a persecuted Church. For example, it\n\nwould support the right of Travellers to housing, often incurring the opposi-\n\ntion of some in the settled community. As at the time of Jesus, the God\n\nwhose passion is compassion was not acceptable to some religious leaders,\n\nwho believed that God’s passion is the observance of the law. Today, this\n\nsame conflict continues between Pope Francis’ vision of a Church of com-\n\npassion to those on the margins and some bishops who believe that Pope\n\nFrancis is leading the Church astray by not strongly condemning those who\n\nbreak the law. The Church, today, is seen by many as a provider of services:\n\nMasses, baptisms, first communions, confirmations, weddings, funerals.\n\nThe Church is one big yawn for young people as long as Church involvement,\n\nconcerns itself primarily with Church involvement. It appears to them as a\n\nChurch that is inward-looking, focused on itself. Unless the Church redis-\n\ncovers the centrality of social justice to its mission, it will become increas-\n\ningly irrelevant. It must, therefore, become primarily a Church of service,\n\nand only secondly a Church of services. The Church should be at the fore-\n\nfront of serving the poor, homeless, refugees, Travellers, immigrants, drug\n\nusers, the sick, the elderly, and the lonely. When non-Christians look at the\n\nChurch, they should be amazed at the Church members’ love and care for\n\nthe unwanted and rejected.\n\nChurch As Organisation: In the Church of the future, leadership will be ex-\n\nercised predominantly by laypeople. Unlike at the time of Jesus, gender\n\nequality today is seen as a fundamental justice issue, so women must play\n\nan equal role in leadership. Decisions in the parish will no longer be taken\n\nby a parish priest. The primary role of the priest is to preside at the Eucha-\n\nrist, the centre of Church life. At the Eucharist, we recall how this Church\n\nstarted, namely, through Jesus’ self-sacrifice on the cross for us. We recall\n\nJesus’ words, “This is my Body which will be broken for you; this is my Blood\n\nwhich shall be poured out for you.” and then we hear Jesus’ instruction: “Do\n\nthis (yourselves) in memory of me.” (Reality Jan/Feb 2022)\n\nSeeing your Life through the Lens of the Gospel John Byrne osa\n\n1.We are told that Jesus ‘fixed his eyes on the disciples’ before speaking. It\n\nsuggests that he was about to say something that he really wanted them to\n\ntake in. Surprisingly he then tells them it is no bad thing for us to be poor or\n\nhungry but, perhaps you have recognised the truth in what St. Augustine\n\nsaid: ‘You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless\n\nuntil they rest in you.’\n\n2.‘Blessed are you who weep’ is not an encouragement to be miserable but\n\nan affirmation of the importance of loving relationships in life. We are\n\nblessed to have such people in our lives, but there may also be pain. Is it not\n\ntrue that the blessing of loving and being loved is worth the price you pay?\n\n3.Jesus said that his followers would be open to opposition and ridicule be-\n\ncause of him, – and they are blessed when this happens. Unpleasant it may,\n\nbut have you not been grateful on those occasions when you had the cour-\n\nage to stand by something that you believed in?\n\nPoints to Ponder (Intercom, February 2022)\n\nSome robbers came once to a hermitage and said, ‘We’ve come to take\n\neverything out of your cell’. The hermit said ‘Take whatever you see, my\n\nsons.’ So, they took what they found in the cell, and went away but they\n\nmissed a little bag that was hidden in the corner. The hermit picked it up,\n\nand ran after them, shouting, ‘My sons, you missed this; take it.’ They were\n\namazed at his patience and restored everything, and did penance before\n\nhim. They said to each other, ‘Truly this is a man of God.’\n\n(Sayings of the Desert Fathers)\n\nThe story from the Desert Fathers, set in 4th century Egypt, exemplifies a\n\nperfect fidelity to the words of Jesus. We find it delightful, and it makes us\n\nsmile. We smile because although we find this hermit utterly admirable, it\n\nwould never occur to us to imitate him.\n\nThe purpose of today’s Gospel is not to make us feel\n\nguilty, but to inspire us, and to rekindle our desire for the Kingdom. We,\n\nwho belong to Christ, are reminded today that our deepest desire really is\n\nfor the holiness to which He calls us. We are here now to express and\n\nnourish that desire by coming to Jesus in the Holy Eucharist. Ultimately, the\n\nreward we are promised is Christ Himself; the gift Christ makes of Himself.\n\nGo mbeannaí Dia dhuit, a Ghobnait Naofa\n\nGo mbeannaí Muire dhuit is beannaím féin duit.\n\nIs chughat-sa a thánag ag gearán mo scéil leat\n\nIs a d’iarraidh my leighis ar son Dé ort.\n\nMay God bless you, Holy Saint Gobnait,\n\nAnd may Mary bless you, and I bless you myself.\n\nFor it is to you that I come, to plead my case with you,\n\nTo request my healing, from you on God’s part.\n\nThe beehive is the symbol of St. Gobnait because, when a pagan\n\nchief was attempting a cattle raid, she took up one of the\n\nbeehives of the convent and directed it at the raiders.

Envia promised a lithium-ion technology that would make a leap in energy density and thus slash the cost of electric cars. It even convinced General Motors to sign a deal and invest millions of dollars. At the time, the car giant desperately needed a new battery for the next-generation Chevy Volt that was due in 2016. But after raising nearly $30 million and spending 10 years in operation, Envia fell short on delivering its magical battery and went out of business in 2017.\n\nhttps://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-next-major-innovation-in-batteries-might-be-here\n\nTRIBUTE Sean Adams February 2022\n\nADAMS, Seán (Adams Garage Glin and Tralee), The Avenue, Glin, Co.
