Much depends on the way it is presented, but mnch more depends on the facts themselves. An ac- count of excavations in south-western Peru is not likely to hold our interest for very many bv Bobert Svmpson Jameson, earlv in January, 1837. The early years of the house's history are woven into the story of Mr. and Mrs. Jameson. Mr. Jameson was born at Westmoreland in 1798, his wife Anna Murphy, daughter of an pages, but the story of our own house spells interest from the outset. And when part of the house is over one hundred years old, then its story is indeed history, and human interest history at its best. For our own convenience, we can divide the story into four parts, or periods, based on the names of the occupants. These will be (1) The Jameson Period, from 1837 to 1844, (2) The Widder Period, from 1844 to 1865, (3) The Loretto period, from 1867 to 1930, and (4) The Jesuit Period from 1930 up to the present time. This present article em- braces only the first period. The history of all Canada is the story of forts and wars, the story of forts growing into towns, the story of towns becoming cities. Tor- onto is no exception to this, and Old Fort York, the nucleus from which it grew, is still stand- ing. Less than a mile east of this fort, along the shores of Lake Ontario, was an old military reserve, called Government Common. Five acres of the eastern portion of this reserve were fenced oft' for the first time as private property Irish miniature-portrait painter, was born in Dublin in 1794. The two were engaged in 1820, but it was soon broken oft'. Five years later, after a chance meeting, the engagement was renewed and tli(\\v were married. Mr. Jameson practised law. first in London for the next four years, and then in the West Indies, on the island of Dominica. In the year 1833 he was sent to Canada as attorney-general. When he left for Canada, Mrs. Jameson accepted the position of governess to a family in Germany. In the course of the next three years, Mr. Jameson tried to get his wife to come out to Caiiada to live with him, and Mrs. Jameson in her turn, sought every possible excuse to re- main in Europe. Whether her love for him had cooled, or whether she had never loved him, it Avould be hard to say, but it took a form- al demand from ]\\Ir. Jameson to make her come. She sailed from England early in September, 1836, and arrived in New York in November. No one met her, and she had to make the whole trip to Toronto alone. The reception here was LORETTO RAINBOW 139 as cold as the weather at that time of year and Mr. Jameson's attitnde did not reassnre her. They were to live with Justice IFajrernian, at the corner of Wellinjrton and Siiiicoe Streets, till their own house was finished. In March she was able to write, \"About a week ago, we removed into a new house, our present residence has never been inhabited, and it is not quite finished, it will be very plea- sant, no doubt, when it is not so cold and com- fortless. We are surrounded by a garden of some extent, or rather what will be a garden at some future time; at present it is a bleak waste of snow. The site though now so dreary, must be charming in Summer, for we command at one glance the entrance to the bay, the King's pier (At the foot of Bathurst), the light house, and beyond, the whole expanse of the Lake to the Niagara shore.\" The house to which she refers, is but a very insignificant portion of the Semjinary as it now stands. It includes what is at present the small parlour, and lialf of the large one. It was a small two story house M^ith a pointed roof, and was placed roughly in the middle of the property. She might have told us that the front door faced Brock Street, and that four large windows on the ground floor afforded an excellent view of Lake Ontario to the South, beyond which lay the island Avhich made it difficult to see much of the Niagara shore. It is interesting to note in passing, how these boundaries have changed since the time the Jamesons built this first unit of our Seminary. The portion of Spadina between Queen Street and the Bay was known as Brock Street. In 1010 that part too was changed to Spadina. The present name is based on an Indian word mean- ing \"a sudden elevation of land.\" The refer- ence is to the hill just north of Davenport. On- tario Terrace was so called because the Lake at that time came right up to its banks; it is now known as Front Street. Market Street had been changed to Wellington Place before the house was built, and after 1910 was known as Wellington Street. F'rom the first days in the new house, JMrs. Jameson saw that she was never going to be happy; her husband was cold, aloof and dicta- torial, while she on her part remained quite independent. Mr. Jameson's health was al- ready undermined by drink; indeed, this was the cause of his death at the comparatively early age of 56. Mrs. Jameson loathed Toronto, from the day she first picked her way through the mud to their temporary house. In a letter to friends in England she describes Toronto as, \"A little ill-built town on low land, at the bottom of a frozen bny. with one very ugly church (St. James) without tower or steeple: some government buildings built of staring red brick in the most tasteless and vulgar style imaginable.\" On yet another occasion she called it, — \"A fifth rate provincial town, with all the pretensions of a capital city.\" It is a matter of some conjecture just when she made up her mind to leave; most likely she never intended to stay at all. In the spring of 1837, she started off alone on a tour of the western portion of the province. She visited Hamilton, Niagara, London and Detroit. Prom there she went up Lake Huron to Sault St. Marie, and down through Penetanguishene to Toronto, and reached her home in the middle of August. The only thing that kept her in Toronto, was the arranging for an allowance of three hundred pounds. When this was com- pleted, she sailed from New York in the Aut- umn. Mr. Jameson wrote to her just before she sailed, and said that it was. — \"An arrange- ment which I am compelled to believe is best calculated for your happiness, and which there- fore I cannot but approve.\" She arrived back in London in the spring of 1838, just when society was in a ferment Avith the excitement of a coronation. The rest of her life was spent in writing and travelling in England, and on the continent. One of her twenty-two books was completed shortly after she arrived back in England ; this was \"Winter studies and Summer rambles in Canada.\" It is this book that furnishes much of the informa- tion of her life and travels during the short time she was in Canada. When dealing Avith Toronto, her picture is always tinted in shades of gray, due no doubt to her unhappy life there. Elsewhere her descriptions are very fine nature studies. Among the circle of her friends from now till her death she could nund)er many familiar names. She Avas intimately acquainted with Ottilie von Goethe, daughter-in-law of the great poet ; she Avas a very close friend of Lady By- ron and jNIr. and Mrs. Robert BroAvning; she received frequent visits from W. M. Thacke- ray, II. W. LongfelloAv, Wa.shington Irving. Hawthorne, and Thomas Carlyle. Besides, she was included among numerous members of the court of the Grand Duke Ernest Augustus. ^lean while, back in Canada, Mr. »Iameson had been appointed Vice-Chancellor for the court of Equity, Avhich appointment took place the very day Mrs. Jameson left for Europe. HoAvever he Avas becoming less and less cap- 140 LORETTO RAINBOW able of handling the affairs of siieh an office. It is possible that evidence of his mental de- rangement may have had something to do with the shake-up in the organization of tlie court. He was retained as Vice-Chancellor, but i-etir- ed in 1850, just four years before his death. Shortly before he died he persuaded his Avife to give up her allowance of three hundred pounds to enable him to invest it, so he told her, in property that would be of value to her after his death. When the will was made public, neither Mrs. Jameson, nor her husband's family Avas included. From the available facts this is what must have happened; in 1844 unknown to his wife, Mr. Jameson had given over the property' as far as he could without her consent, to Mr. Frederick Widder. At that time Mr. Widder was Chief Commissioner for the Canada Comp- any, and records in the city Registry office state that he came into possession of the pro- perty July 4th, 1844, on payment of two thous- and pounds. Another entry, dated December 30th. 1846, records the completion of the deal, when Mr. Widder came into full possession of the estate. Thus closed the first chapter of the house's one hundred and seven years of history. These first occupants lived together in the house just four months. Article 2. The Widder Period 1844-1867 This is the second in a series of articles on the history of the Toronto Jesuit Seminary. In the first article,, we outlined the entire treat- ment, dividing the house's hundred-year story into four periods according to ownership. We then dealt intensively with the first or JAME!- SON Period, from January 5th, 1837, to July 4th, 1844. The Jamesons, you may recall, built the house but lived together in it a mere four months. Mrs. Jameson returned to Europe aft- er less than a year's stay in Toronto, while Mr. Jameson lived on alone in the house till 1844. With that year, the WIDDER Period begins. The house had passed into the hands of new owners. Details of the transaction are not de- scribed, and the cold official records simply state that the grant was made Julv 4th, 1844, on payment of £2000. Frederick Widder, born in 1801, at Austin Friars, London, England, was the eldest in a family of eight. His father was Anthony Ig- natius Widder, born about 1770. This middle name Ignatius was possibly a token of respect for the Austrian Bishop Ignatius of Munich. However, the relation between Widder senior and the Bishop was far more than merely nom- inal : the Bishop educated Frederick's father, and teacher and pupil enjoyed a lasting valued friendship. In 1838, Frederick came to Canada as one of the two commissioners of the Canada Company resident in this country. This Canada Comp- am^ Avas incorporated in 1826 as a land comp- any to boost immigration to Upper Canada. The main ott'ices in Toronto were at 202 King Street East, corner of Frederick Street. Mr. Widder was second comjmissioner for the com- pany from 1839 to 1852, and chief commissioner from 1852 to 1865. An interesting little pam- phlet Avritten by him while in office is still on file at the Ontario Archives in Toronto. This \"Catechism for Intending Immigrants\" de scribes the country, points out the opportun- ities for settlement, and gives data on soil con- ditions, climate, and many other details of Tor- onto and vicinity. Between the years 1830 and 1833, Frederick Widder married Elizabeth Moore, born in England in 1809. Through her father, Sir Henry Moore, she was connected with English Royalty, just as Frederick was eonnected Avith Austro-Bavarian Royalty through his. Eliza- beth seems to have been a very remarkable per- son Avho had clearcut and freely expressed views on CA'erything and everybody. ScA^eral children Avere born to the Widders in Toronto ; at least tAvo died in infancy, Avhile tAA^o others — Blanche and Jane — lived in Toronto for some years. True to Widder family tradition, the Toronto home AA'as called \"Lyndhurst,\" a name that Avas associated Avith the estate for some years to come. Shortly after their arrival, the Widders enlarged their home ; so Lyndhurst noAv meant the original Jameson house, plus a AvestAvard extension of the ground floor, and tAvo ncAV stories Avith a tOAver on the southwest corner. The tAvo A'ery ornate pillars in the present large parlour divide the older portion from the ad- dition ; and on each floor above this, the un- even floor IcA'el clearly shoAvs the added portion. A large stained-glass AvindoAV Avas installed beside the main stairway, just north of the main entrance. This Avindow contains the Wid- der crest and the motto \"Nusquam Meta Mihi.\" traditionally rendered as \"Nothing daunts me.\" The crest shoAA^s a Ram rampant on a field of azure, AAdth a star in the three corners of the shield. It is remarkable hoAv this crest answers the description of Austria's ''Golden Fleece :\" \"The Order of the Golden Fleece, Aus- tria's highest decoration, Avas a small gold LORETTO RAINBOW 141 ram (Widder is German for 'ram'), sus- pended from a starry flintstone, emitting flames, topped by a jewel-studded eliain. It was the most exalted and exclusive or- der in the Avorld, and was fovinded in lirnges, in the year 1459.\" The EVENING TELEGRAM, in an 1882 or 1888 number, gives a brief glimpse of life at Lyiidhurst : \"Away back, about 1845, Mr. Frederick Widder, Commissioner of the Canada Com- pany, took up his residence on the north side of Front Street, west of Brock. Mr. and Mrs. Widder were most hospitable people, and their drawing-room was the centre of social attractions from the mid- forties till the early sixties. The older generation yet living will remember the balls, the dinner parties, and other social events that made Lyndhurst most popular. The entrance to the residence was on Wel- lington Place, and the grounds extended south to Front Street. In 1865 (1867). the building Avas sold to Loretto Abbey, on the resignation of INIr. Widder from the Canada Co. Mr. Widder had arranged to leave for England in January of 1865.\" Indeed, many of these social events drew people from as far away as Detroit. One of the most outstanding of these events was the private ball held in honour of Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, when he visited Toronto from September 8th to 12th, 1860. During these twenty years, Toronto grew so much that the house built outside the city limits (Peter Street) was now nestled in the fashionable residential district that was spread- ing westward along the lakeshore. This too was the time when railroads were going through the most rapid development in their entire history. Mr. Widder was keenly inter- ested in this progress ; in fact, he was a direct- or of ''The Cit}^ of Toronto and Lake Huron Railway\" which served much of the land held by the Canada Company. No doubt this inter- est was appreciated, and it seems to have been rewarded : for a station (no longer in use) some .'{0 miles west of Sarnia, on the present C.N.R. ii'.ain line, bore the name \"Widder.\" Many factors must be kept in mind to ap- preciate the position of the Widders in those still rather remote days. Both husband and wife were connected with Royalty, and kingly bougiis iji the family tree meant much more then than today. And apart from, lineage, a rather high social standing was assured any- one Avho held a government position or an im- portant post like the Commissionership of the Canada Com])any. Also there was the grow- ing custom of exchange-visits between the \"Colony\" and the Old Country; and a trip to Europe or a visit from a European notable al- ways spelt prestige. Most of these visitoi*s came to Canada to hunt or fish, while others came just to see this growing Dominion. These visits frequently meant a stay at the Widder home, and fumi.shed an occasion for the Wid- der social functions which attracted guests from miles around. Thus it is not surprising that the house which was to become Loretto Abbey was more than slightly highlighted with glitter and pageantry. Indeed Lyndhurst was a house of fame. After the Royal visit in 1860, the Widders did not stay very long at Lyndhurst ; the very next year they were back in England, to visit their family and friends in London and Sussex. Several of Frederick's letters written in Eng- land are on file in the Province of Ontario Archives at Toronto, because of their connec- tion with the Canada Comspany. We learn from these letters that Mr. Widder and his daughter Jane arrived at Boston on the Europa, October 18th, 1862, and returned to Toronto where they stayed not at Lyndhurst but at a hotel named \"Rosin House.\" Mr. Widder, noAv 61 years of age, was about to withdraw from public life, and return to England for good. His wife was back in Tor- onto in 1863, but not for long. She went to live with her daughter in Montreal, and on Wednesday, November 23rd, 1864, the editor- ial page of the Toronto paper THE GLOBE, announced her death in Montreal. Mr. Widder himself was practically an invalid, and within three months he too died in Montreal while en route to E)igland. He had resigned as Chief Commissioner of the Canada Company, leaving the Honourable William Beverley Robinson in charge. Mr. Widder died on February 1st, 1865; three days earlier, the CANADA GAZEWE carried a proclamation that the house Avas to be sold by public auction at the Sheriff's office, at noon Saturday, May 12th, 1866. As far as we know, a Mr. Gordon was the only prospective buyer. He felt sure he would get the place, and he even went to England to buy furniture, and to contact one of the persons holding a large share of the Lyndhurst mortgage. How- ever, no action was taken, and the GAZETTE for July 21st carried a second notice setting the sale for September 29th, 1866. Again no ae- 142 LORETTO RAINBOW tion was taken, and the official records state that Loretto took possession in September, 1867, following negotiations that had been going on since March 8th, 1867. It is surprising that the house did not sell readily, since in its beautiful garden setting it was one of the finest homes in or around Toronto, and was at that time far from the citj-'s industrial section. However, trains Avere already at the back door: in 1853, the first steam engine was operating from the site of today's Union Station, and in 1857 a line was opened to Guelph. The Great Western Railway station was located Avhere to- day the southern end of the Bathurst Street bridge passes Old Port York. The shoreline directly south of the estate was at an average of 250 feet from Ontario Terrace (Front Street), while the shops and roundhouse would now be under the north end of the Spadina bridge. Those were the surroundings of the historic house at the end of the Widder Period. Article III — The LORETTO Penod; the JESUIT Period This is the third and last in a series of three articles dealing with the his- tory of the Jesuit Seminary in Toronto. There were four general divisions to the work: first, the JAMESON Period, from 1837 to 1844; second, the WIDDER Period, from 1844 to 1865; third, the LORETTO Period, from 1867 to 1930; fourth; the JESUIT Period, from 1930 to 1945. In dealing with the third and fourth periods, it is not our intention to present a history either of Loretto or of the Jesuits. Good ones can easily be found elsewhere. Our main inter- est therefore is with the buildings in these last two periods. The first two periods dealt both with the buildings and with the occupants. This much should be said however, — Loretto is tlie oldest Catholic educational institution in Toronto. The first house was opened on Duke St.. September 24th, 1847. In 1849, it was moved to Simcoe St. at Wellington, three years later to Bathurst St., ten years later to Bond St. Finally, on September \"the 8th, 1867, Archbishop Lynch said the first Mass in the main parlour of the former Widder home, and Lyndhurst became Loretto Abbey. The guiding figure during these early years of Loretto was Mother Teresa Dease. foundress Plan of the Jesuit Seminary, 403 Wellington St. West, Toronto 2B, Ontario. It will be noticed that the oldest unit in the whole, was built parallel to Front St., the rest parallel to Wellington.

She first heard of the coming sale of the Widder home from a friend of the Bathurst St. Convent, and in- quired about it at once. The location was ideal, as everyone knew, the grounds were spacious, and though the house was one of the most fashionable of its time, it was hardh' the ideal convent, either from the point of view of size or design. After the death of Mr. and :Mrs. Widder, tlie property was leased to a Mrs. Gordon, who liv- ed there with her son and daughter. It was purchased bv the nuns at a Chancery sale, February 6th, 1867. The CANADA GAZETTE carried an advertisement of the sale, first on January 27th, 1866, and again oji July 21st, of that same year. During all this time, no direct move was made to purchase the property, other than the lease of Mrs. Gordon. Mr. Gordon LORETTO RAINBOW 143 fully intended to buy the lionse, and at the time of the sale, he was in England bnyin<r furni- ture suitable for a house such as Lyndlnn-st. Had he been in Toronto, he would have bid stift'ly to acquire the property His wife tried her best to prevent any sale, and at first re- fused to allow the nuns to see the house, as she was quite sure her husbaiul intended to buy it. When this delay proved inadequate, she pro- vided another. Under no condition would the sale be made unless the carpets on the main floor, and certain other furnishings were pur- chased too. Mother Dease readily consented to meet this new device, and after much negoti- ation, the purchase was finally completed. Archbishop Lynch wished the Widder stain- ecl-glass window to remain in its place in the front hall, ''A token,\" he said, \"of the Victory of Religion over the Avorld.\" This window, on the east side of the main staii'-well, contain- ed the Widder coat-of-arms. and tlie motto \"Nusquam Meta Mihi;\" the traditional family translation reading: Nothing Daunts ]\\[e. This window still stands within arm's reach of the altar in a chapel sometimes used as the Semi- nary's Avinter chapel, and has far greater sig- nificance in its present surroundings than it ever had before. The details of this window were desci'ibed in the previous article. Within four years, the first addition to the former Widder home was made. This was a temporary Aving, and stood where the present wing number 6 stands (see diagram.) It con- tained a chapel, examination hall, and recre- atio)i hall, and ran north from the old house, towards Wellington St. Part of that addition stands today, part was demolished as will be seen later, to make way for wing numbers 5, 6 and 3. This addition was a three-story build- ing of white brick construction. Its princi)>al function in Ijoretto Abbey was to provide space for music lessons in individual rooms on the first two floors, and sleeping accommoda- tion on the 3rd floor. In the basement under this wing Avas located the laundry. This Aving is used at present for layman retreats held at the Seminary, in connection Avith the Catholic ]\\ren's Retr-eat Association. It Avas renovated some years ago for this Avork, and has accom- modation for 24 men, and a chapel large enough for a feAv more. The second permanent addition to the Ab- bey Avas Aving number 4. The first sod for this Aving Avas turned on July 4th, 1882, and Avithin tAVO Aveeks the Avork had reached the top of the first story. There are many interesting expla- nations given for the use of both red and Avhite brick in the exterior of this building. It Avas begun in red, inside and out. and had reached the first story Avhen His Grace Archbishop Lynch visited, and expressed disapproval of this material for the interior of the chapel. From this point on, the construction is in white brick, at least on the outside. It Avas too late to do anything about the first story, and there is record of the nuns 'tinting' the aa'«11s of the chapel, shortly after it Avas opened. To make the tAA'o colours still more visible on the out- side, red paint Avas applied a fcAv years ago to the red brick portion of the exterior. As has been said, the ground floor of this wing Avas used as a chapel, though in the plans, the chapel Avas to be located on the top floor. On April 27, I88:-). Reverend ¥. Rooney of St. ^Mary's parish erected the stations of the cross, \"Where,\" to quote the Loretto Annals, \"oAving to the unfinished appearance of the red brick walls. Reverend Mother had deferred placing them properly.\" The most extensive additions and alterations to the Abbey began in 1897, and finished Avith the arrangement as it still stands today. At this time, the temporary Aving iiinning north from the old house Avas demolished to make Avay for Aving numbers 5 and 6, both of 5 stories, addition number 7 of 4 stories, and the large chapel to the south-east. The architect for this Avork Avas Mr. Beaumont Jarvis. Avhose name is inscribed on a leaded-glass AvindoAV on the north side of Aving 6 (second floor). The builders Avere Messrs. Wicket Bros., and the carpenter- ing Avas done by John Hannaford. The cha])el commemorates the first 50 years of Loretto in Toronto, 1847-1897. A fcAv Avords about this chapel should prove interesting; the first quo- tation is from a ncAvspaper dated April 27, 1899, and reads in part: The interior of the ncAv chapel is a beauti- ful picture. A roAv of solid pillars reaching to the roof far above on either side of the main aisle gives a classic countenance. The floor of the Sanctuary is fitted Avith high- ly polished straight-backed pews, not croAvded together, but leaving room for the ])rocessional. The interior of the new chapel is furnished in Avhite and gold. Tlie ceiling is curved and set Avith a hundred electric candles. The purity of the decora- tions, the beauty of the Avorkmanship, the excellence of the architecture cannot be livalled by any church in Toronto. The folloAving description is taken from a program of the \"Grand Jubilee Concert\" on the 144 LORBTTO RAINBOW occasion of the opening of the new buildings. It was held on Wednesday, June 14th, 1899 : — The chapel building's exterior is in the style of the Italian Renaissance, and makes a verj- handsome and imposing ap- pearance, the centre dome being one hun- dred feet high. The interior is extremely • rich in architectural features. The archi- tect has designed it somewhat in the form of a miniature cathedral, with nave aisles, and transept ; the intersection and the chancels being crowned with a very strongly designed dome. The style is a severe Roman classic adaptation of both the Corinthian and Ionic orders, the form- er being placed throughout the transepts and chancel, while the Ionic pilasters di- vide and enrich the nave and aisles. The main altar differs from the chapel, being executed in Italian Renaissance. It is 86 feet high, and between the decorated shafts is an arch which contains the splendid oil painting of the Holy Family by Wyly Grier. This is a masterpiece of mural dec- oration. Above this are two bas-relief angels holding scrolls. The following is a translation of the in- scription on the corner-stone of this new chapel : — On the third day of November, 1897, the Most Reverend John Walsh, Archbishop of Toronto, blessed and laid the corner- stone of a chapel that is to be erected on this spot to the honour and glory of God, and the Holy Family. As has been said, this new chapel was only one of four wings erected at this time; these are indicated on the diagram as numbers 5, 6, 7, 8. A few words about 6, 7 and 8 will con- clude the story of the building of the present structure. Wing number 5 contained the ma- jority of the classrooms, wlhile in its basement were located the dining-rooms and two gym- nasia. Wing number 6 serves as a connecting link for three of the eight wings, and as a con- venient way to bring together the uneven floor levels of the various wings. Number 7 was an extension eastward of the old house. Outside, it helped to bring some unity in architecture to the three wings about the front door. The lower hall of this wing provided access to the chapel and concert hall. The grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes on the second floor was used in the reception of candidates into the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Here, they made their first act of consecration. The little chapel retains its name today, and has been referred to as being within arm's reach of the Widder stained-glass window. The third and fourth floors of this wing are divided into small rooms, occupied at present by philosophers. Wing number 8, the chapel and concert hall- remains unchanged, save that the house library for the seminary now occupies the west half of the concert hall. The corner-stone for the new Loretto Abbey Armour Heights was laid on Sunday, May 22, 1927, and school was opened on September 11, 1928. The old Abbey was used for the next year as a novitiate and administration headquarters, and the transfer to the Society of Jesus was completed Friday, June 27th, 1930. The old Loretto Abbev officially became the JESUIT SEMINARY at' 5 p.m., Monday, June 30th, when the last of the nuns presented the first of the Jesuits with the large key to the front door. When Mass was said next day it was said in the 'Jesuit Seminary Chapel.' Hence there has been no interruption in daily Mass at the house since September 7th, 1867, 78 years ago. Today, there is an average of 35 to 40 Masses in the house every day. A word then about the 15 years of the Jesuit Period. Under its first Rector, the late Father W. Dojde, S.J., the philosophy classes began in September of 1930. During the first summer, 1930. some alterations were made in the house, for Seminary use. Of the Original staff, ap- pointed that year, three men are still stationed here. In order of arrival, these are Brother Peter Bela, S.J., Father J. Keating, S.J., and Father T. J. Lally, S.J. In 1943, to the faculty of Philosophy was ad- ded that of Theology. Additional rooms were required, and extra altars were built for the large number of daily Masses. The top floor of \"wing number 4, originally intended for a chapel, — though never used as one, — was made over to provide 8 rooms and 7 altars. The top floor of wing number 5 was made over to pro- vide 6 extra rooms, and several large rooms on the fourth floor were divided to accommodate the 100 men stationed here this year. As far as the exterior is concerned, the building looks much as it did at the turn of the century, after due allowance has been made for the one hundred and eighty seasons that have elapsed. Its onetime beauty has been dull- ed and streaked with soot from the 'yards' south of the house, and it is now flanked on three sides by factories and office buildings. This corner of the Old Military Reserve has LORETTO RAINBOW 145 cliaiij^ed a j^ood ileal since Mi'. .laiiiesoii first fenced off his 15 acres just west of Brock (Si)a- dina). at the corner of Ontario Terrace (Front St.) That was before Confederation, before tiie telephone or teletrrai)h. before railroads.

The lake that used to laj) against the banks of Ontario Terrace has been pushed back by reclaimed land, to make way for the railroads' right-of-way to Toronto's I^nion Station; and few other landmarks remain to show the Mili- tary Reserve of 1(K) yeai-s ago.

Beside it, the glories of Babylon and Greece grow dim, and the rise and fall of the Roman Empire cease to be a marvel. That its influence on the ages to come will be even more lasting than those of Ancient Greece and Rome is beyond question, for in its destinies are mapped the interests of liberty and civilization to the end of time. In 1776 when the American Colonies assum- ed the right of self-government, and formed themselves into a union, they nnmbered but thirteen feeble states, and three million inhab- itants occupying that small and familiar strip of territory lined on one side by the Atlantic Ocean — on the other, by the Alleghany Ridge. In 1800 the Indians were still torturing white men to death on the banks of the Miami River ; and as late as 1822, Ohio represented our \"Far West.\" At the end of the century, 1876, our boundaries were watered by the Atlantic and the great Pacific ; the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean ; our covmtry sweeping in hemis- pheric magnitude from the mountain crests of eternal snows to the region of perpetual bloom, and cradling in her arm.s 40;0O0.00O free, intelli- gent and powerful citizens. The mere assertion of such facts as these would read like a fairy tale were it not accomp- anied by the history of the trials and triumphs of the noble founders of our Great Republic. Tlie turbid waters of the Revolution had hard- ly subsided Avhen another problem presented itself to every patriot's mind. The existing form of government was no longer adequate to the requirements of the time, and it was evident to all that it must soon be swept away. The question of a substitute, however, was most vexatious, and called forth all the diplomacy and patriotism of our early law-makers. Balmes says: \"The mysterious hand which governs the universe seems to hold an extra- ordinary man in reserve for every great crisis of society,\" and nowhere has this been more fully verified than at this period of the histor.y of the United States. It was the great crisis of the forming of our Constitution that brought forth such men as Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Morris, Patrick Henry, and John Hancock, Benjaiuin Franklin, John and Samuel Adams, and others, who nobly did their part. Not with rustle of silk, or Avaving plumes, or click of spurs v\\-as our Constitution drawn up Great and generous men, by their patriotism, their wisdom and their courage, laid the foun- dation upon which was to be erected the noble edifice of our Great Republic. In the progress of American developments there Avere four great wars that shook the Re- public to its very core. They, above all other events, have moulded and determined the quality and character of our civilization. The War of Independence — that fierce and noble struggle that gave us birth — left its im- press on the men of the time, and no doubt did more to form the character of the American people than any of the three that followed. The war of 38] 2, sometimes styled \"our war of dignity,\" made the nations of the world recognize us as one of themselves; and know that we were no longer a handful of brave patriots fighting for freedom, but a nation contending for her rights. The Mexican War might well be called our first war of acquisition, since it added tAvo more stars to our \"spangled banner.\" In it Almo, Buena Vista, Monterey, and Chapulte- pec, shed their luster on America's arms; and the entrance of Scott into the halls of Monte- zuma, as conqueror of the enemy's chief city, Avas the first instance of a foreign capital en- tered by the army of the United States. Wars have grafted constructions on tlic constitutions of every nation, and so, our Civil War. that deplorable \"AVar of Brothers,\" forc- ibly and forcA'er construed and interpreted our Constitution. It Avas in itself no question of moral right or Avrong that Avas involved in that aAvful problem, it Avas a question of the true spirit and interpretation of the constitutional contract, and the meaning of the Union. The question of moral right and Avrong can enter LORETTO RAINBOW 147 only to test the siiieerit\\- or insincerity of the adversary of the respective views. If both were sincere, then both were patriotic, and one was right and one was wrong. The South fought so gloriously, and so bravely for what she felt were her rights, we can but think that Provi- dence intervened to save a nation's cause, and preserve a great Republic — and glad are we. Americans, that our country, our whole coun- try, took up again its zodiacal pathway on- ward and upward to the summit of its sunlit history. Nor do we regret these struggles, since they have given us a noble heritage of names of undying greatness, immortal heirlooms which but for the crucible of these great events to give them fiery birth would never have existed : A AVashington, a Barry, a Scott, a Johnson, a Grant and a Lee ''But these are not the only ones. Posterity shall know them all Brass and marble shall show them to the re- motest ages. In beholding them shall the friend of freedom feel his heart palpitate with joy Under the bust of one of them has been written 'He wrested thunder from the heavens; and the scepter from tyrants.' Of the last of this eulogy shall all of them partake.\" \"There are gallant hearts whose glory Columbia loves to name, Whose deeds shall live in story And everlasting fame.\" \"In the land they loved they have sunk to rest, And their fame burns bright on each free- man's breast.\" After the Revolution the American people, being cut off from foreign resources, were obliged to depend upon their own industry and ingenuity to furnish articles required in the usual occupations of life. How well their inventive faculties supplied these wants, the cotton gin, the first steamboat and the tele- graph, testify. A popular rhyme in England at the time referred to the invention of the tclegi-aph by Morse as — \"That steed called Lightning (say the Pates) Is used in the United States : 'Twas Franklin's hand that caught the horse ; 'Twas harnessed by Professor ]\\Iorse.\" One of the most important events in our na- tional progress was the finding of gold in Cali- fornia. No modern event has been the cause of so much romance in real life. No branch or sphere of trade, though perfected by long experience, has called into employment so many of its means and instrumentalities of diversified human industry, and commercial intercourse; indeed, nothing within the memory of man, except the achievements of steam and the electric telegraph, approach so nearly to magic as the discovery of gold on the shores of the Pacific, and that, too, -in the soil of a territory which, by conquest and purchase, had but just fallen, like fruit golden-ripe, into the lap of the Great Republic. Gold places were marked in certain portions of California long before the discovery jiLst mentioned, but the change wrought by this dis- covery in 1845 caused California to be admitted as a state two years later, and increased the population from\"80,00() to 600,000 in ten years. The importance of the gold mines in California, whose richness is not yet exhausted, can hardly be overestimated. It is not surprising that clergymen, doctors, lawyers, merchants, me- chanics, farmers, clerks, and traders left their counting rooms, their workshops, their ben- ches, and their pulpits, to seek their fortunes in this Eldorado of the west. \"Westward the course of empire takes its wa.v;\" the celebrated line of Bishop Berkley is too gratifying to national vanit.v not to be of- ten quoted : and if we look on it in the nature of a prediction, the completion of it not being limited to any particidar time, to di.sprove it would be difficidt. Had the good bishop, how- ever, substituted \"freedom\" for \"empire\" it would already be fully justified b,v experience in the United States. In the Old World nation- al pride feeds itself with the record of battles and conquests — battles which proved nothing and settled nothing; conquests which shifted boundaries on the map, and put one head in- stead of another on coins which the people paid to tax gatherers; but wherever the Amer- ic?in may travel in his homeland he finds, churches, schools, and colleges recording the history of his countr.v in terms more eloquent than was ever Avritten the slaughter of a battle, or the glory of a conquest. \"No nation can prosi)er if the education of its people be neglected,\" .said George Washing- ton The readiness with which the American people voluntarily taxed them^elves that the iile.ssings of intellectual culture might be free to all ; the unparalleled munificence of private gifts and befjnests for the founding of edu- cational institutions; the architectural splen- dor of our modern school buildings, which are 148 LORETTO RAINBOW to be found in every city, town, or village, and even dottinia: the hills and valleys of this vast commonweal th, are all evidences that the ad- vice of the P^ither of our countr,y has not been unheeded. In 1800 there were but twenty-five colleges in the United States; during the suc- ceeding seventy-six years, the number increas- ed nearly fifteen times, ranking the United States foremost among the educated countries of the world. But among the phenomena that marked the growth of the First Century there is not one more interesting, more significant, or indeed, more paradoxical than the development of Catholicism. At the time we cast off English rule, Catholics numbered only about one per cent of the population — thirty or forty thous- and in a total of three millions. In 1876 they had increased to nearly two per cent of the population of some forty millions. At the be- ginning of the century we had one Catholic Bishop, at its close, sixty-six Bishops and Arch- bishops, and a Cardinal. New York, founded by Protestant merchants, and grown to be the legitimate pride of Ang'.o-Saxon power, Avas, after Paris and Vienna, the largest Catholic city in the world. Under the shadow of the Constitution, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the Catholic Church has grown and flourished in this great republic, ju:)r have her sons been ungrateful for the pro- tection received. Second only to their religion is their patriotism, as is shown by the statistics which reveal the truth that Catholics have furnished more than their due proportion of soldiers for the defence of this country. A noted \\vriter has said, \"Our country is only the place where Providence has placed us to do the most good we can for humanity;\" and, indeed, it would seem that this was the prin- ciple that actuated our forefathers in the American Church. \"With Catholicism,\" says M. Brunetiere, \"began also toleration and re- ligious liberty in America,\" and he adds, \"It is the (^'atholie Church that has overcome the modern tendency in this country, to inculcate one religion for the poor and another for the millionaire.\" As Catholics, we maj* well be proud of the progress the Church has made during our First Century; although it can not surprise us As silently as the temple of Solomon. rose our Church during the first century in the United States. It remains for the present and future generations to see that it continue like that temple an evidence of the beauty and unity of the worship of God. Could our forefathers in the Old World, who marveled at the success of our War for Inde- pendence, have lived to visit our first Cen- tennial, their surprise would have turned to wonder, Avell-grovnided. America 'svas making her influence felt in the Avorld of Letters. An appreciation of the Fine Arts was becoming evident, while the useful arts flourished throughout the land. Steamboats threaded our rivers, carrying merchandise, and, facilitating commerce. Thousands of miles of railroad linked all parts of this vast country into one great \"netwn)rk of traffic.\" Grandly hopeful, and full of wonderful jiossibilities was our Great Republic at the end of her First Century, with her manufactures and her industries; with her proud young cities, the jewels of her hope ; with her schools and her churches. \"With labor vocal on every hillside, and commerce white on every sea,\" she beckoned the stranger to a habitation and a home.

Mother General also asked for it, as she heard of its arrival. I could almost envy you your many and varied activities We have to let golden opportunities pass and be thankful if we can carry on from clay to day. This is a small world after all. We knew the Rev. Gerald Doyle, mentioned in the \"Chronicle,\" when he was a student in Rome, and we have just had a letter from him ; and I, when I was at Oxford, knew Dom Justin McCann, O.S.S. Is this the same one? He was then head of St. Benet's Hall — and very kind. I hope that '\"The Spirit of Mary Ward\" has already arrived, or will soon do so. I could not send a letter with it, so I just put my signature, to show Avhere it came from. We should be glad to send you other copies if you liked, and if we knew how. I hope the regulations Avill be simpler, now that the war is over. It is extraordinary to look back now, and think that we were enabled to go on teaching English, and even holding certificate examina- tions in the very jaws of the lion, so to speak. Nothing happened to us, though there was a moment when we buried the best altar plate, and suppressed some of the library. This .spring we had the great satisfaction of knowing that Cambridge University had recognized the ex- aminations we had substituted for theirs during the Nazi-Fascist occupation, and would give its own certificate without further test to all the candidates we had accepted. A convent in Brussels carried on, too, in the same way, and their results were recognized. We are to have a great presentation of diplomas as soon as we can arrange. Of course, there are some students we can't trace, and some— R.I.P. Three were carried away to Germany ; God grant they may still be found living. How strange the evening and night when the Allies readied Rome! To- wards midnight we heard the whole city stir- ring— the Italians running to and fro, shout- ing \"Alo !\" in their best English. Next morn- ing, no lessons, of course, but we were in the garden almost all day, receiving the pupils who rushed to congratulate us, and to tell what they had seen — and that they had spoken English, and been really understood! Other than the pupils, the first who came was a man in the Intelligence. We gave him tea which — if he had only known it — was as liquid gold to us; then we sat around like chil- dren listening to a fairy story when he told us his doings. Afterwards the Chaplains, such splendid people, called. There was Father Farrell, S.J., who had been at Anzio, and had had the Blessed Sacrament on his person for three months, because there was nowhere he could put it safely. He stayed a long time in these parts, and made good use of our library. And there was Father Savage, who got ahead of his unit, in Africa, and received the surrend- er of hospitals, etc., all by himself. He preached for the tercentenary of Mother Mary Ward, in January; and Father Dessain, who brought the first real news from Ascot, where his sister is one of Ours (I.B.V.M.) We heard afterwards that his courage was noted even where all were heroes, AVhen Terms began all the world wanted to learn English. The portress nearly went crazy; and, when we had to go from one class-room to another, we sometimes had to push our way through the crowds of would be pupils who had almost \"broken in.\" When it is possible would you please send us The Rainbow, and thank you again for your letter Always affectionately yours in Xt., M.

Pauline, I.B.V.M. which was no joke under the circumstances. LORET TO RAINBOW 151 She was extremely clever and would do little kindnesses to this firm and that one in order to procure us butter, etc. When we were first interned the house was already occupied by missionaries from Manchuria, who were intern- ed in their missionary country on the very day of the declaration of war, Dec. 8th, 1941. They only arrived in Japan the following April, and twice were on the verge of getting away — with their trunks even down at the harbour, but each time they were disappointed. They are the ones who are evacuating tomorrow to Scot- land, or England, or Wales, and several are from the north of Ireland. Some of them have been in Manchuria for over thirty years, but they usually went home on furlough every six years. Four unmarried American missionaries left for America almost two years ago. The fifth person to go with them was a married business woman, a Southerner, but whose hus- band was connected with a large tobacco firm in Mukden, Manchuria. She carried on his business after his death a few years ago. I am sure she will manage to get back to the East before long. In order to make place for us in Eastern Lodge, several men and priests were sent to another camp. Shortly before our ar- rival, this lady was baptised and is now a fer- vent Catholic. Her eldest son who was in Shanghai was able to accompany his mother back to America. Weil, to return to our intern- ed life in Kobe, Ave and the seculars got on very well together. We had practically no place to walk, so now and again were taken to the hills for health's sake. We paraded along the streets two by two, like a lot of school children and re- turned about two hours later. As far as our spirituals were concerned, we heard Mass on Fridays and Sundays Avhen a priest from one of the other camps Avas brought here by a guard (from our camp) who used to fetch him and accompany him back. We were deeply grate- ful for this. I must say that the guards we had in Kobe were very friendly and we formed but one big family. When the five ladies from America left, the Canadian Dominican Father who had been saying Mass for us twice a week was sent back to our camp to take up his quart- ers again. We were all delighted as it meant daily Mass, weekly confessions and various conferences during the week and a m>ost help- ful sermon every Sunday. The seculars were vei-y fond of him. He was gracious and friendly and always ready to put his personal interests aside to join them in their innocent games. We did a great deal of sewing and knitting, and attended interesting lectures almost weekly from some one in the camp, and profited by the musical recitals, etc. Now and again we had various kinds of entertainments. Everything regarding camp life has been highly organized with committees of all kinds. One of our nuns was interned only a fort- night, as she had an Irish Pass|)ort and should- n't have been interned at all. Mother Macfar- lane (Mrs. Young's sister) was allowed to be taken back to Qbayashi about the 17th of De- cember, 1943. She complained of her back and was soon confined to bed with a back attack of sciatica. The Japanese Doctor (who studied in America and, of course, spoke English flu- ently) was most devoted and interested in her case. But the Internment Camp was not the place for her. After a great deal of red tape, permission was finally given to have her re- moved to our Convent. Of course she didn't seem so ill, and the authorities knew how friendly the Doctor was with the foreigners so were rather skeptical. In spite of the best of treatment she received in Obayashi, she grad- ually lost weight and could do nothing to help herself. Her limbs grew weaker day by day and her suffering increased. Finally she pa.ssed away almost a year after her departure from internment life. Her sisters must have receiv- ed all the details from Rev. Mother Sheldon, who almost through a miracle was never in- terned in spite of being a British subject. Mother IMacfarlane died Nov. 21st, 1943. (We had already left Kobe for Nagasaki). Her death proved an immense sorrow to us all. She was so bright and full of fun. The children simply loved her. She was Mistress of Discip- line in the Boarding School ever since her ar- rival in Japan about 12 or 18 years ago. She had a taking way with her pupils while, at the same time, she held firmly to the keeping of the School Rule. When we return to our Con- vent in Obayashi we shall mass her presence, especially around the school part where she devoted herself day and night. She is buried in our beautiful little cemetery just a stone's throw from the playgrounds. Will you please express my deepest .sympathy to the Macfar- lane family. Mother Kate loved her sisters dearly and was sorely affected when she receiv- ed any sad news of their families. Please tell her sisters that she was fully conscious at the end and was happy to go to Our Lord. On July 1st, 1943, we were all sent down here to Nagasaki. The announcement of the re- moval of the Camp to such a distance simplj'' stunned us. It didn't make so much difference to the seculars; as Kobe meant nothing to them, as all their interests are in Manchuria. But it was a blow to us because it meant all our con- 152 LORETTO RAINBOW iieetions with our Convent would be severed. We had almost a week to prepare ajul the auth- orities allowed our nuns who were not interned to come and see us several times. We left Kobe for the station July 1st, about 8.45 p.m., num- bering 40. Sixteen were Sacred Heart Nuns, one a Sister of Naverre (English) and 7 Sisters of the Congregation of the Infant Jesus, who are all French Canadians. The remaining num- ber were seculars. We knew we were destined for Nagasaki but had no idea as to how or where we were to be housed. We waited around the Station until after 5,00 with four guards who came from Nagasaki to escort us to our new Internment Camp. We left the station, not so badly installed, occupjang almost an en- tire car. It was a rather slow train, stopping at small towns all through the night. Passen- gers jioured in, with no place to sit down, but our guards roped off our part of the car, so we were left in peace in our corner. We reached Nagasaki the following afternoon about 6.00 p.m. A bus took half of the party to their new camp. The rest of us stood in an open place outside of the Station, waiting for the bus to return. We had a good laugh over a funny spectacle. This is what happened. Such a crowd of passers-by stopped to look at us that a policeman had to put up a rope to keep the mob back. Finally, after a drive of about a quarter of an hour on the bus, we were invited to get out at the foot of a hill. We climbed and climb- ed up a narrow pathway through a pagan ceme- tery. Finally we reached the top and found a very poor wooden structure which proved to be a Franciscan monastery. Further on was a better eonstructed wooden building formerly a seminary but converted into a camp for men. Many of the latter left the country on the Tai Maru in 1948. The 16 men remaining were sent to Kobe camp, as they wished to have all the men in one place. We arrived here tired and dirty, but fortunately all our luggage and bedding had arrived before us and we con- cluded that the good Polish Franciscan Fathers. Brothers, and their pupils must have carried all that luggage up for us. We were forbidden from the very first day to speak to them. This meant no Mass, no Communion. This building is a two-storied structure. On the first floor are class-rooms. One has been used as a dining- room, another as a common room, and the few remaining were transformed into bedrooms for the married couples. The second floor is one big hall, and at the very end of it is a nice little chapel. We found beds but nothing else in the way of furniture, but plenty of vermin. There was not a sign of a chair. Fortunate'v we had brought our camp stools along with us which have since served even as washstands. The life down here proved very different from Kobe, We have all kept well from so much out- of-door life. There was a Chinese cook when we arrived, partly interned himself. His master, a Belgian, had been interned here, but was sent to Kobe. The cook, (although there was very little to cook) was often absent, either being sent on errands for the guards or in bed witli bronchitis. So one of our Sisters has been do- ing most of the kitchen work. But teams were organized to peel vegetables, wash the dishes, etc. We did all the cleaning, Avashing of clothes, keeping the Avliole place swept, etc. We Avere often to be found on the hills cutting grass. Two of the Protestant ministers devoted themselves to the precious cow, and we were given some of the milk, almost a glass each, everA^^ morning to do us for the day. We kept watering it in order to make it last. Ladies and gentlemen were all anxious to cut as much grass as possible for the precious cow. I Avas charged Avith seven rabbits Avith enormous ap- petites! So you can judge that the life in this camp Avas mostly taken up Avith manual work. We had fcAV night raids during the winter months for Avhich Ave Avere exceedingly grateful as it Avas bitterly cold here during the nights. But for the last fcAv months, day and night, there Avere no alarms. Cities and tOAvns on this island Avere heavily bombed but not the City of Nagasaki until more recently. We have been completely isolated, so had had A'ery little knoAvledge of Avhat Avas happening. We had the daily iicavs in Kobe but once Ave got doAvn here the ncAvspapers Avere not delivered to the subscribers. Our kind Franciscan neighbors. Avhen passing the interned ministers Avhen in the fields, Avould give them a bit of news on the sly. The Protestant missionaries here, and the Franciscans struck up a real friendship. Of -course, the guards here didn't know that one of the brothers spoke English. Some of the Sisters here even did some mending for our good Franciscans and little messages Avent backAvards and forAvards. Thank God nobody Avas found out. We had Holy Mass on Fridays but never on Sundays, as the Japanese priest had to say Mass in his parish. Often Ave Avent several Aveeks Avithout Holy Mass. It Avas difficult to accept this disappointment Avitli three Franciscan priests living just a fcAV steps aAvay. On August the 9th there Avas a \"first Avarn- ing\" but by 9.00 there Avas an \"all clear\" siren. I saAv the Chinese cook go off to the city Avith the A'oung Japanese Avoman AA^ho comes here by LORETTO RAINBOW 153 the day to go cn-iiiKls for tlie guards. Soiuo of us went off grass-cutting a little later in the jiiorning. It was a beautiful day. I should have told you that we are surrounded by hills. This will help you to j)ietui-e nie when the bond) exploded. One guard usually aeeom])anied lis when we Avent grass-cutting to see that we didn't go near the farmers' little fields, but only gleaned on the narrow paths between them. Lately the guards didn't seem to follow us so closely on this point. Yet we were obliged to ask their permission. Having no radio and no newspapers, the disaster which took place in Hiroshima on the 6th never reached us. But we did remark on the nervousness of the guards. They didn't like to see us go any distance from the house; as soon as there Avas a \"first warn- ing\" even those occupied Avith the farmyard had to remain indoors. At 11.00, as I Avas mak- ing my Avay doAvn the hill Avith a huge bag of grass on my back, a heaA'y plane, although in- visible, seemed to be moving very slowly just over my head. It Avas the first time 1 felt rath- er anxious about the approach of planes. I thought it strange that there Avas no siren as they have been so particular on this point. T think the approach of a solitary plane de- ceived the Japanese. I felt certain that it was an enemy plane. I looked up to see if it Avere visible, but quickly decided that it Avould be Aviser to hurry back to the Camp as I saAv none of the others around. I began to run. T had only gone a fcAV steps Avhen there Avas a fearful explosion and e\\'erything Avas of a golden yel- loAv. It seemed as though tlie sun had burst and I AA'as lost in its midst. I thrcAv myself at once into a clump of youn.g bamboo trees. I was lying on the big bag of grass. My face only felt hot. The golden light only lasted a fcAv moments, but as I thought some more planes Avould be coming, I dragged the bag from under me and covered my head and back. As jiothing more happened, I hurried back to the house only to find it had been badly shaken. Some peop'e Avere cut on head and neck and arms, not seriously, and several among those Avho were Avearing glasses got cut around the eyes, but none had their eyes affected. In fact it Avas miraculous I think that none lost their sight, because everybody indoors Avas in a building AvLth numerous sliding doors made almost en- tirely of glass. The rooms on both sides of the corridor not only have doors made almost Avholly of glass but, for the sake of giving more light to the rooms, there are sliding Avin- doAvs on the corridor side, the Avhole length of each room. All these AvindoAvs and doors Avere lying in heaps in the narroAv corridor. WindoAvs and transoms blew into the grounds and the chimney Avas found iji a field some distance away in hundreds of pieces. Fortunately our Sister had gone out of the kitchen. OtherAvise she Avould iiave been killed, as the Avindows and glass doors blew in. It Avas impossible to get up the Avide staircase as it Ava.s a mountain of plaster. We got shovels and made a little path up the stairs. The second floor, as I told you previously, is a big dormitory for the 2:5 religious and 4 unmarried missionary ladies. Some had the lens blown out of their spectacle frames, others had the lens broken, or cracked. Most of the people upstairs got under their beds as they are all near the Avindows. Avhich smashed and crashed to the accompaniment of falling plaster. We had no furniture to be broken, but the bamboo sticks at the four cor- ners of our beds to support our mosquito net- tings did look funny indeed standing out in all directions. The dormitory looked like a dried-iip bamboo grove. We only have a space of about tAvo feet betAveen the beds. It took nearly the Avhole day to shovel out the plaster betAveen the beds. Glass Avas everyAvhere ami all our little private things (mostly \"emi)ty\" tins from the much appreciated Red Cross boxes) Avere mixed up Avith the glass and plast- er. The devotional little chapel Avas badly dam- aged and shaken. Statues Avere .smashed and the Avails and woodAvork are in a terrible state. As the day di'CAv to a close, Ave Avei-e all very sad as the cook and Japanese Avoman had not returned. We learned that the cook had been killed. The Avoman died of injuries three Aveeks later. All the first day and night the mountains Avere on fire for miles and miles. TAvo-thirds of the i)opulation of Nagasaki are dead. We have not seen the city as Ave are hidden from it by a hill. We are just on the outskirts. The city itself is a ma.ss of ruins. They are still burning the dead. No ojie is al- loAved to pasTS througli Avhat Avas once the city. From the second story Ave could see buildings burning at the far end. We Avatched the flames creeping up to the pretty \"Church of the Mar- tyrs.\" Urakami about two miles distant hard- ly exists anymore! This place (Urakami) is the most Catholic part of Japan and possessed the most beautiful Church in the coinitry. Fam- ilies of even 8 or 9 children Avere all burned oj- killed. Priests young and old are dead The hospitals here and elscAvhere on this island having been destroyed, the Avounded are not being properly attended to. Of the 10,000 Catholics of iTrakami, only 1,000 survive. Our Japanese lay-sister in our convent in Obay- ashi Avhose home was in Urakami, has lost her 154 LORETTO RAINBOW rather, mother, two sistei's, hrotlier-in-law and nephew. Our 3 Japanese postulants have h^st all their people. The Nuns interned with us of the Congregation of the Infant Jesus had many ])arish schools and kindergartens in these parts. All their houses but one are destroyed. Of their 14 capable Japanese sisters in Urakami, 12 liave died and the other tAvo will die also. Some were buried with their pupils in the schools. The effects of this bomb on the hu- man frame are interesting the schools of med- icine already. Some patients apparently re- covered then suddenly died from hemorrhages. I must tell you hoAv we heard of peace. We went to bed as usual on Aug. 16th with onr air-raid bundles close at hand, although there had been no sirens on the loth or ] 6th. At one o'clock in the morning (Aug. 17th), the guards rang the bell and sent word upstairs that we Averc to lini-ry to the dining room and not to take the time to finish dressing. No air-raid bundles Avere to be taken. This seemed aAA^fully strange. We scrambled doAA'n in the dark as usual but found the light on in the dining room. A line of officials Avalked in, including our OAAm guards, and ordered everyone to sit down. T personally thought that the Allies had made a landing and that the Japanese Avanted to let us all knoAv. The head man stood up and Avhen all Avas quiet, smiled most grac- iously saying (in Japanese) : \"Congratulations! The Avar is over. We have been defeated and you are the victors.\" There Avas simply an \"Oh !\" and a long draAvn out \"Ah !\" from us all. We Avere stunned. The official put out his hand and said in a .jolly Avay : \"Let us all shake hands and celebrate.\" Cigarettes and matches and wine AA'ere passed in abundance. Everybody behaved Avell and Avould like to have retired, but the official's seemed anxious to have us re- main on. We Avere supposed to be free from that moment, but life Avent on as usual in the Camp. We hadn't had Mass that Aveek as the Japanese priest Avho Avas accustomed to come had too much to do among his oavu suffering people. In fact, Ave haven't seen him since be- fore the disaster. All intercourse Avith our Franciscan neighbours Avas still prohibited un- til Aug. 23rd Avhen Ave Avere alloAved to go down to their little Church for daily Mass. Noav. one of the Franciscans comes here every morning to say Mass, and Ave can go freely to their Church for Benediction toAvards evening. We can speak to any of them at any time. The guards, strange to say. used to send for the brother electrician, or brother carpenter, etc., to mend and repair things in the house all through internment life. Of course, the inter- nees got in many a little Avord w\\\\]\\ them by this means. As they had a radio, they managed by all kinds of ways to give ncAvs to the men interned. We expect now to be told any day to ])ack up and leave for Obayashi. You can imagine hoAv Ave are longing to be back in our Convent. I hope you are all Avell and happy. Much love to I.iOrraine and each member of the family. I am looking forAvard to ucavs of you all. Your affectionate sister, Reggie McKenna, R. S.C.J.

It is our great pleasure to have as our guests, to complement the anniversary's festiv- ities, a group of seventy-five students from Loretto Academy, the institution of learning and culture, standing so beautifully on its majestic site above the Canadian Falls. The girls opened the program with the invocation to the Holy Spirit, \"0 Come, Creator, Spirit, Come,\" Father Paber^'s variation of tlie hvmn, \"Come, Holy Ghost,\" set to music by K. Kur- pinski. We hear them again, as they raise their A'oices in the canticle of praise to God. the \"Te Deum.\" The musical score is distinctly Gre- gorian chant, and was Avritten by the Rev. Dr. J. E. Ronan. It is interesting to note that Father Ronan composed the theme to be used, for the first time, as the closing chorus for the school play, \"St. Thomas More,\" staged in the Academy Auditorium in the Spring of 1943. Although the girls are taught by the'sisters of Loretto, and trained musically by them, they are being directed today hy Miss Ma'rjorie White, a recent graduate. The piano accomp- animent will be played by Miss Mary Lunan. MUSIC: (2min.) ANNOUNCER: For a brief. encore the school chorus has chosen to sing the hymn, \"Praise Ye the Lord.\" The melody is traditional, handed down from those times, centuries ago, when men used their talents for a very high motive, and zealously avoided attaching their signatures to the gems they produced, lest they might gain some personal fame therefrom. MUSIC: .... (30 sees.) ANNOUNCER: The Catholic Program has been sent out over the air from Niagara Falls during almost the entire operating existence of this radio 'station. Thus, while in the course of human events, many come and go, one familiar figure has been seen around the studio frequently and continuously for five long years. I refer, of ocurse, to Father Crowley, who has himself remarked that people around the hotel probably think that he is on the pay roll. He has been pei'sonally responsible for the regular Saturday broadcast since its inception. Al- though he has had to give time and effort to an extra project m addition to his ordinary church duties, it was fortunate for the permanence of the program that the same person arrange it and preserve its continuity. It happens that the Bishop has kept him near enough to care for what we might call \"his baby,\" which he has reared quite close to the age of reason. No doubt he has something to say. and, surely, we expect that, on this anniversary day. So we shall bring him in right here. Father Crowley. FATHER CROWLEY: Thank you, Ken. You know, I have a real, solid advantage in not be- ing paid, because if I were, in the many at- tempts to improve programs I would have long since been fired. It is true that there have been various changes in the staff, and I re- member nearly all of them ; made some good friends through association with them; and even correspond with one who left, and Avent on to greater deeds a long time ago. Which is, indeed, positive proof of the friendly co-opera- LORETTO RAINBOW 157 tioii we have always had from the announcers and members of the office department. My principal feeling, on the occasion of a little milestone like this, is one of gratitude to all who have helped to attain whatever success may have been accomplished. First to be thanked is the station management, without whose grant of time the program would have been imi)ossible. Besides the 15 minutes every Saturday we have been given generous con- sideration for two important projects each year, namely, the Catholic Charities Appeal in the Spi'ing aiul IMission Sunday in October. It is difficult to measure the impetus su])i)lied these activities by the many radio broadcasts in their behalf, and I wish to acknowledge publicly our appreciation for the free time. A special thought of remembrance must be enter- tained for the many priests attached to the several parishes in Niagara Falls, who were our guest speakers for the first two or three years. Preparing their talks robbed them of spare time, and this they did willingly. It was planned at the beginning to feature a dift'er- ent voice and style from week to week. How- ever, most of these men Avere transferred to other cities, or. because of the war, the depart- ure of priests as chaplains increased the burd- ens of those left at home. The upset conditions caused a necessary change of policy, with the result that our listeners have had to bear pati- ently with the monotony of me doing practical- l.v all the talking the last two years. We have not forgotten any of those Reverend helpers, among whom were Father John P. Duggan, who became an arm^^ Chaplain, has risen to the rank of Major, and who Avas awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service in the Mediterran- ean Theatre of Operations; and his co-worker at St. Mary's Church, Father Thomas O'Rourke, beloved by the High School students for liis personal interest in them and his direction of their athletic events. His poetic style made a lasting impresvsion upon me and. I am sure, up- on all who heard him through their loudspeak- ers. His death here brought to an abrupt end a very promising life of work for the Church. I cannot mention every one. but allow me to recall my former partner. Father John Cidbert ; Father Gulnerich. whom so many will remem- ber as the chaplain at St. Mary's Hospital ; Father Kasprzyk, of Holy Trinity; Father W.ysochinski of St. Stanislaus; also my present neighbor along Lake Ontario, Father Di Giov- aimi; and the native son of the Falls. Father Louis Langley, Avho is also overseas as Chaplain. My deepest gratitude to them all for their val- uable assistance in the pioneer days. Music on our programs had not, at least primarily, the purpose of entertainment. Just as the talks brought out information concern- ing the teachings of the Church, the ehoral numbers were intended to make our audience familiar with some of the vast and devotional store of ecclesiastical, litui-gical, compositions, many of which we do not always have an op- portunity of hearing. Groups of singei-s from the local churches and organizations to supply the music were preferred to transcribed pieces, and in spite of many difficulties, we were able to furnish live shows a good deal of the time. Considering the morning pei-iod of the bi-oad- cast, it can be readily seen that it was well nigh impossible to entertain with adult choirs. Pro- duction for the war made it imperative that people Avork steadily, and excluded a Sabbath morning off to make a radio appeai-ance. Selec- tive serA'ice kept picking uj) good male voices being developed by the organists around tlie city. However, the music directors courageous- ly met the obstacles and performed some mir- acles in order to add an artistic touch to our performances. We had to rely almost entirely upon the school children, and the zeal of the Sisters to get them ready. We owe a debt of thanks to them and the oi-ga'iists for having lepresentatives fi'om just about all the paro- chial schools of the cit.v. The children from St. Joseph's, as Avell as the choir there, stepped forward often during the last year and a half, Avhen the going became exti-a tougli. Perhaps the renditions offei'cd Avere not always every- thing to be desired, but those who know how much tedious training and practice are needed to reach perfection in vocal work, and Avho rea- lize hoAv sensitive the microi)hone is to flaws, will be considerate and ai)preciative of the effort. I, for one, am fully cons<'ious of the energy and nervous struggle that Avent into the fcAV minutes of singing presented on our pro- grams, and am heartily grateful for every bit of it. A little over a year before October of 1040, the Avar began; in a like period afterward we were in the fight. In the meantime Ave exper- ienced some sad and feai-ful days; acts of tre- mendous desti'uction and ci-uclty Avere perpe- trated. ]\\rachines of death were iuA'ented and ]>ut into motion, Avhich staggered the imagina- tion, all the Ava.A' from steel dragons breathing dust and spitting fire in the deserts of Africa. to the ultimate atomic bondi sent to split Avar into peace in Japan. When children Avere be- ing evacuated from the cities of England be- cause of the fear of air-bombing, the action seemed to be the decision of alarmists, but sub- 158 LORETTO RAINBOW sequent e^'ents proved that anything could hap- pen. In a world full of startling surprises, one eould easily come to the conclusion that he was not sure of anything — that is, with one re- assuring exception, namely the teachings of ('h)'ist. and tliose according to the interpreta- tion of the organization to which lie gave them, to preserve in their pristine purity and to pass on to men of all generations. History does not tleny oi clialienge the fact that the Catholic (\"hurch Avas the one who received those divine truths from His mouth. She Avas there and was chai'ged with the duty to teach and preach. She is as old as the rock of Peter, and as young as the successor of th"
