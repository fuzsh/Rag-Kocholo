The event’s theme, “Convicted Civility,” resounded throughout the evening’s festivities, particularly in the poignant words of featured speaker Robert Gates, chancellor of the College of William & Mary and former United States secretary of defense (2006-2011). The University also celebrated the impact of the thousands of supporters who generously gave during Give2Pepp, Pepperdine’s first-ever Giving Day."
