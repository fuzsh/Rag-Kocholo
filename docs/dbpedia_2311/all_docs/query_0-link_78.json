After the war he snubbed the rise of Abstract Expressionism in favour of the good life in Italy and New England.\n\nAs America entered the war Perlin joined the United States Office of War Information. Placed in the Graphics Division, he produced bold, block-coloured posters and lithographs to rally the nation’s morale. His Let ‘Em Have It sheets – in which a GI hurls a grenade while the public are called on to buy more war bonds – were to become ubiquitous across the stores and stations of the American home front. Another, from 1943, declared that “Americans Will Always Fight for Liberty” and pictured contemporary American soldiers set against a backdrop of Benjamin Franklin’s Independence troops.\n\nThis patriotic delivery was to be diffused by his experiences embedded in an American commando unit in the Mediterranean. Here he drew and painted works for Time and Fortune magazines.\n\nHis gouaches captured the struggle of Greek civilians – often Resistance fighters – caught behind German lines; blood-soaked operating theatres; and soldiers preparing for action picked out in the inky blue of moonlight. He explained that he would often relive a battle in his mind before committing paint to canvas. He also sketched out caricatures and portraits, including a deep-lined profile of General Douglas MacArthur. He later covered the war in the South Pacific and Asia, where he was on board the “Mighty Mo” (USS Missouri) for the formal Japanese surrender, and remained in the region to record the war’s aftermath.\n\nHis gouaches captured the struggle of Greek civilians – often Resistance fighters – caught behind German lines; blood-soaked operating theatres; and soldiers preparing for action picked out in the inky blue of moonlight. He explained that he would often relive a battle in his mind before committing paint to canvas. He also sketched out caricatures and portraits, including a deep-lined profile of General Douglas MacArthur. He later covered the war in the South Pacific and Asia, where he was on board the “Mighty Mo” (USS Missouri) for the formal Japanese surrender, and remained in the region to record the war’s aftermath.\n\nBernard Perlin was born in Richmond, Virginia, on November 21 1918 into a family of Jewish Russian-émigré tailors. In 1934, after his artistic promise had been spotted at high school, he enrolled at the New York School of Design. He then studied at the National Academy of Design Art School and the Art Students League before receiving a scholarship to develop his work in Poland.\n\nOn his return, Perlin was commissioned by the US Treasury to paint a vivid mural – depicting a late-1930s country scene – on a Post Office wall in the New Jersey village of South Orange (for which he was paid $2,000). It was a community project that would be a precursor to his Social Realist work during, and in the wake of, the war.\n\nAfter his wartime experiences Perlin’s delivery turned towards Magical Realism, an informal school with an artistic lineage that can be traced from Frida Kahlo to Edward Hopper. His aim was to capture an “everyday magic” powered by both realism and surrealism.\n\nPerhaps his most famous painting was executed in this period. Orthodox Boys (1948) pictured two boys in their skull caps pondering a Hebrew text on a platform at Manhattan’s Canal Street subway. Behind them a wall displays a thousand doodles – from lovers’ declarations to notes by Nazi sympathisers. It is a snapshot of a specific time and culture given an almost sinister air.\n\nThe painting, now in the Tate’s collection, was to inform the development of the young British Pop artist, Peter Blake. “It was one of the first Magic Realist pictures I saw,” Blake said in 2001. “The whole school of Magic Realism was a great influence on my painting.”\n\nPerlin’s post-war career would be guided by an ever-shifting focus – both in terms of style and subject. In 1948, shortly after painting Orthodox Boys, he relocated to Italy, staying for six years, painting what he termed simply “beautiful pictures”. Social realism gave way to dreamlike images of Capri’s cliffs and the Spanish Steps in Rome and took on a new palette of deep reds and shocking greens.\n\nReturning to New York, he was confronted by a transformed art scene. Punchy, beer-fuelled Abstract Expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, lorded over the network of galleries and seduced – in all senses of the word – patrons such as Peggy Guggenheim. Perlin was repelled by this resolutely anti-figurative and incestuous hothouse environment. He moved to the haven of Ridgefield, Connecticut, “to escape the artificial, ego-pressured world of artists in New York, competing with each other to make the most money”. The leafy confines of New England forged an increasingly Impressionistic and contemplative approach – a 1968 portrait of Truman Capote depicts the author almost dissolving into the white sun-bleached haze of a drawing room.\n\nIn the 1970s Perlin stopped painting and, with his partner, later husband, Edward Newell, lived quietly, growing flowers in his small conservatory. It was a respite that would last for many years – he only returned to the easel late in life. “Every painting is like a book,” stated Perlin last year. “Every book is about something different, and has something different to say. That’s what painting is like. People always ask me why my paintings are so different they might have been done by several artists. Well, I’ve gone through many different phases of life — it’s been full of changes, so why would I stick to one technique?”\n\nPerlin held teaching posts at the Brooklyn Museum Art School (1946-48) and Wooster School, Danbury, Connecticut (1967-69). His works are held in many of the world’s leading collections, including those of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nEdward Newell survives him.\n\nBernard Perlin, born November 21 1918, died January 14 2014\n\nGuardian:\n\nNow that most of the western press has finally dropped the use of the article when referring to Ukraine, I wonder how many revolutions the Ukrainians will need to have for the Guardian to drop the Russian spelling for Kiev (Letters, 25 February). Granted, there is a fast-moving situation on the ground, but the capital of Ukraine has been Kyiv since Ukrainians (east and west) united in a historic vote (possibly the freest and fairest in their history) to secede from the Soviet Union in 1991, causing its collapse. Keep up.\n\nSusan Bailey\n\nKings Langley, Hertfordshire\n\n• The British government would appear to have been taken by surprise by the events in Ukraine. Was GCHQ too busy looking at sexually explicit webcam images to monitor the activity of the Russians (Revealed: GCHQ intercepted webcam images from millions of Yahoo users, 28 February)?\n\nTony Mason\n\nBristol\n\n• Your summary of new flag options (Which new UK flag did you choose?, G2, 3 March) omitted one salient point in favour of the first choice, which has a black background: that the Cornish flag of St Piran is a white cross on a black background. Cornwall would then receive the recognition it deserves as a separate entity within the UK.\n\nRoger Brake\n\nLittle Trevellion, Cornwall\n\n• When I was a child we went to the loo to do Big Things.

Game ova.\n\nJames Hornsby\n\nNorthampton\n\nFollowing his resignation as chief executive of the RSPCA through ill health (Report, 25 February), I pay respect to Gavin Grant and I wish the RSPCA success in meeting its challenges. In a relentlessly driven commercial arena, one can feel for the leader of an organisation committed by its constitutional objectives to animal welfare in all forms. Buffeting of the Grant-led RSPCA has been unsparing and frequently contradictory: for having or spending too much money, or too little; for vigorously pursuing prosecution of those violating animals, or for soft-pedalling the issue; for over-asserting animal rights, or for neglecting them.\n\nToo often indeed those traducing the society during Grant’s tenure pursue interests inimical to animal welfare, informed by the commercial imperative alone. In 2013 I was commissioned by Gavin Grant’s RSPCA to chair what became the McNair inquiry and report into Freedom Food, the leading animal welfare assurance scheme. This followed criticisms I had made of the scheme. I was permitted to act wholly independently of the RSPCA, to build my panel as I wished (former Defra secretary Caroline Spelman and veterinary academic Professor David Main) and to take evidence and deploy our findings. The report and its recommendations are no devotional exercise yet have been endorsed unanimously by the governance of the RSPCA.\n\nThe RSPCA has a long and distinguished record in alleviating wanton animal suffering. While continuing its work for domestic pets and wildlife, in an age of industrial and sometimes brutal factory farming, and where austerity has depleted regulatory disciplines, the RSPCA must also exert its influence for the wellbeing of those 95% of the nation’s animals in food production. Flaws acknowledged, the RSPCA deserves our support in setting its hand to issues which research shows will affect our own health and that of our planet increasingly over time. As a start it should implement the McNair recommendations without delay. And it should not be chastened by assaults from those far outside the tent of animal welfare.\n\nDuncan McNair\n\nChairman, McNair inquiry and report\n\nShirley Williams raises a critical point about the importance of access for humanitarian organisations working inside Syria (Letters, 3 March). In spite of the huge challenge we face working in a war zone, the World Food Programme successfully delivered food assistance to 3.7 million people inside Syria last month. We would like to reach many more. WFP has just completed the last of 24 humanitarian airlifts from Erbil in Iraq to Qamishli in north-eastern Syria, where we are providing assistance to 60,000 people living in one of these areas that are hard to reach by road. But airlifts are costly and no substitute for regular access by truck convoys.\n\nBaroness Williams raises the possibility of “food drops” as a last-ditch measure to reach those in besieged areas. While it would be rash to rule anything out, air drops are probably impractical. They require a team on the ground to secure a drop zone and people in place to collect and distribute the aid when it falls and ensure it gets to the weak and the vulnerable. Insecurity means that it is almost impossible for this kind of deployment under current circumstances.\n\nWFP is grateful to donors who have already provided funds in 2014. However, at present, our operations in Syria are only 5% funded, and support to refugees in neighbouring countries stands at 7% of what is required for the year. $200m is urgently needed for WFP to continue its assistance until the end of April. We would like to scale up assistance further. Airlifts are an expensive option; sporadic and one-off convoys into besieged areas can provide temporary humanitarian relief. But WFP needs continuous and sustained access to provide life-saving food assistance.\n\nGreg Barrow\n\nDirector, World Food Programme London Office\n\nYou invite readers (Editorial, 28 February) to compare Tory statements in 2006 and the article you published by Iain Duncan Smith and George Osborne. The same exercise could be applied to the Guardian and its response to how best to combat poverty. You now write that money by itself is not enough, important as it is. It can put food on the table and lessen stress. But by itself it does not have life-changing qualities. I tried in 2010 in the Foundation Years report I compiled for the prime minister to answer what this other strategy had to be if we are, in the reports’ subtitle, to prevent poor children from becoming poor adults. Life chances of most children are determined early. Gaps in achievement and outcomes are already stark by age three and poorer children arrive at school already far behind their richer peers, less well prepared and less ready for education. These gaps remain, and indeed widen, during the school years. Schools improve the abilities of all children, while failing to reduce class differences. Any anti-poverty strategy worth its name must centre on radically changing life chances before children come into school. Otherwise you will be writing leaders on this very issue to the last day of recorded time.\n\nFrank Field MP\n\nLabour, Birkenhead\n\nThe coalition recently lost a battle to close the thriving and solvent Lewisham hospital when an adjacent hospital was suffering financial problems due to government cuts and disastrous PFI debts. The coalition subsequently rushed through an amendment to the care bill (clause 119) which gives sweeping powers allowing Whitehall bureaucrats to close any English hospitals without full and proper local consultation (Report, 27 February). With this “hospital closure clause” in place, no English hospital will be safe from financially driven closures. Local patients, clinicians and commissioners will have little meaningful say in the closure process. Whatever happened to the mantra used by the coalition to sell the recent NHS reconfiguration to us all – “no decision about me without me”. In effect clause 119 brings about a fast-track hospital closure process. Clause 119 is pernicious and hugely damaging to the future of healthcare in England and we implore politicians to withdraw clause 119 or vote against it as it moves through parliament.\n\nDr David Wrigley GP, Carnforth, Lancashire\n\nDave Prentis General secretary, Unison\n\nPaul Kenny General secretay, GMB\n\nFrances O’Grady General secretary, TUC\n\nLen McCluskey General secretary, Unite\n\nProfessor Cathy Warwick Chief executive, RCM\n\nPhil Gray Chief executive, CSP\n\nDr Kailash Chand Deputy chair, BMA\n\nDr Clive Peedell Leader, National Health Action Party\n\nDr Jacky Davis Co-chair, NHS Consultants Association\n\nChristina McAnea Head of health, Unison\n\nDr Ron Singer President, MPU\n\nProfesor Ray Tallis\n\nProfessor Allyson Pollock\n\nClive Stafford-Smith\n\nDr Louise Irvine\n\nRachael Maskell Head of health, Unite\n\nDr Iona Heath\n\nDr David Nicholl\n\nProf Sue Richards Co-chair, Keep Our NHS Public\n\nJohn Lipetz Co-chair, Keep Our NHS Public\n\n• Notwithstanding the Home Office’s duty to manage Britain’s borders, everyone living here should have access to essential healthcare. This is critical for the sick, to help contain disease and, in the long run, for our economy. The immigration bill being scrutinised in the Lords proposes to substantially extend charging for NHS services, including to pregnant women, children, and trafficked people. Around 90% of pregnant women seen at Doctors of the World’s clinic for excluded migrants in east London have received no antenatal care, despite most having lived here for three years before seeking medical help. Home Office access to patients’ data will further exacerbate the problem, as more sick people will be too afraid to access care for fear their details will go to the UK Border Agency. The NHS constitution is clear that healthcare should be available to all regardless of status or ability to pay. Our health service should not be used as a tool of exclusion or immigration control.\n\nLord Richard Rogers\n\nTrustee, Doctors of the World UK, part of the Médecins du Monde network\n\n• If as Jackie Ashley (Comment, 27 February) indicates, NHS Change Day has empowered staff to speak out, then it will be a positive force in addressing the business management hegemony, introduced in the 1980s. However, it may just reinforce a sort of “Boxer syndrome” (Animal Farm), where staff believe that problems are their fault and they must work harder. The result will not be a better service in the long term, but one where staff, in identifying areas of change, create a rod for management to beat them with. In working better or harder, staff will find that this often results in staff cuts, time and motion studies, and an increase in staff dissatisfaction.\n\nMany of those in senior positions act as administrators and not, as the service desperately needs, leaders. Change is often viewed negatively, or merely cost-related, and as attacks on the status quo. So to suggest that the clinicians at the sharp end of the NHS can create lasting change in a system that doesn’t normally value their views seems to me highly unlikely.\n\nDr Peter Wimpenny\n\nGairloch, Highlands\n\nThe proposal to link hospital and general practice records through the intended care.data system has generated intense discussion (Care.data is in chaos, 1 March). This has so far been confined to concerns over inappropriate commercial exploitation of the data and leakage of confidential information.\n\nWhile these are important aspects, we also have concerns relating to what happens when data are not linked accurately. There is increasing international evidence that the inevitable errors occurring during data linkage can distort types of analyses that care.data aims to support. Data such as NHS number and date of birth, which are used to link records, are never perfect and often it is particular kinds of people, for example ethnic minorities, who fail to get linked and thus fall outside the system. Failing to link records for the same person or wrongly linking different people can produce seriously misleading results, even when only a small minority are wrongly linked. More transparency about the nature and extent of linkage processes and linkage error would help medical researchers assess potential distortions and help service providers to improve data quality.\n\nAs for confidentiality, this is best preserved by proper monitoring of patient records, with strict security controls on access. Proposals to “scramble” patient identifiers before data leave the GP record systems are not the solution, and would actually make matters worse by increasing the numbers of wrongly matched records. In our view, the current debate needs to include a full discussion of all these linkage quality problems.\n\nProfessor Harvey Goldstein University College London & University of Bristol, Professor Ruth Gilbert University College London, Dr Katie Harron University College London, Dr Gareth Hagger-Johnson University College London, Dr Mario Cortina University College London , Dr Nirupa Dattani City University\n\n• There is a simple step which can be taken to address the care.data controversy. The Health and Social Care Information Centre should give a public undertaking that it will provide only analysis of GP patient data to outside bodies. Patient data would never be disclosed to outside bodies. Ideally this should be formalised by statute and applied to all patient data gathered by NHS services. Any analysis requested could be subject to ethics committee review and, when complete, identified on the HSCIC website. These steps, quickly taken and appropriately publicised, might support public acceptance of the creation of a highly valuable national healthcare asset.\n\nMalcolm Rogan\n\nNomansland, Wiltshire\n\n• Your piece on use of patient record data (MPs’ anger at missing data on who has seen patient records, 26 February) quotes Dr Stephanie Bown as saying that GPs “worry that patients’ concerns about care.data could prevent them from speaking openly to their doctor”. Such concerns already do so, whenever an individual is seeking life insurance. The insistence of the insurance industry on an applicant’s agreeing to their GP’s report often leads to reluctance on the part of patients to share symptoms they think might affect their premiums. Similar damaging reluctance to engage in healthcare may precede holidays when travel insurance cover depends on absence of pending hospital appointments.\n\nThe public benefit that will follow successful implementation of the care records system is likely to be enormous and the challenge to confidentiality nugatory. By contrast, there is no identifiable general public benefit in the long-established collusion between the insurance industry and the NHS. It should be banned.\n\nProfessor Robert Boyd\n\nAdlington, Cheshire\n\n• Improving health services, as far as the government is concerned, will also mean cutting costs by delaying treatment, reducing eligibility for expensive drugs or operations, increasing charges, and furthering privatisation. The care.data computer system would enable it to monitor whether doctors and nurses carry out central instructions. Whether it would really be much use for evaluating treatment – given that so many factors influence outcomes, such as lifestyle and whether patients actually take all the drugs they are prescribed – is another question when it comes to justifying the cost of yet another huge computer system. The Office for National Statistics is trusted and has great experience in analysing the census and other large data sets. It would be much preferred to any private firm. Otherwise the money might be better spent by the Medical Research Council.\n\nDr Richard Turner\n\nHarrogate\n\nIndependent:\n\nSteve Richards states (4 March), almost in passing, the fundamental truth of the situation in Ukraine, namely that an elected president has been deposed by a diverse (read “motley”) band. Why is the British Foreign Secretary posing, quite literally, with Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the apparent supporter of the mob rule which has taken hold of western Ukraine and which has provoked this crisis?\n\nOf course the Russians, both in the Crimea and more widely, feel that their vital interests are under threat and have acted to safeguard them. It is to be hoped that they will continue to act with restraint in a highly inflammable and dangerous situation, not of their making.\n\nRoger Blassberg, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n\nThat the West lacks the military resources or the will to launch an offensive against Russia’s invasion of Crimea is beyond doubt. It is also doubtful that Putin has much appetite for a full-blown occupation of Ukraine, on three major counts.\n\nFirst, if he gets Ukraine, he gets back the notorious Chernobyl site whose far-reaching deadly effects are still with us nearly 30 years on. Lurking not far from Kiev, like a sleeping monster, Chernobyl is still there, entombed in concrete, surrounded by miles of radioactive countryside.\n\nRussia would also be lumbered with what little remains of its once mighty Ukrainian-based Soviet military-industrial complex, which dates back to the days of the Tsars. Beyond producing wheat and exporting dodgy ex-Soviet cameras, Ukraine’s economy is less bread-basket than a basket case, hardly a glittering prize for Moscow.\n\nThird, post-Sochi, an impoverished Russia has Gazprom and Europe needs Gazprom.\n\nThat is why, beyond an ego-trip and some post-Soviet posturing, Moscow will say “nyet” to a full re-appropriation of Ukraine and the West will say “no” to a fight for Crimea.\n\nAnthony Rodriguez, Staines, Middlesex\n\nWilliam Hague is a member of the Conservative Friends of Israel and as such he is not an anti-Semite; obvious enough, but then why is he backing the Svoboda Party, which has illegally taken power in Ukraine? A brief look at Svoboda’s political make up will make every Jewish person shudder, with their pro-Nazi views and anti-Semitism, but Mr Hague sees no problem.\n\nAnti-Semitism is not something to condemn and then ignore when it is politically suitable to do so. It should always be condemned and Mr Hague’s membership of Conservative Friends of Israel needs revoking.\n\nDr Kevin Cordes, Derby\n\nSuddenly British politicians have discovered some compassion for east Europeans.\n\nUntil Mr Putin’s intervention in Crimea, Ukrainians, like their neighbours in Romania and Bulgaria, would have been seen as a potential immigration threat by at the very least the Faragist wing of the Tory party.\n\nTsar Vlad the Great offers to take this problem off their hands – and they are all up in arms.\n\nKeith B Watts, Wolverhampton\n\nDispute over the remains of Richard III\n\nNews that scientists at the University of Leicester are subjecting the mortal remains of Richard III to further destructive tests in order to sequence the king’s genome raises serious questions of propriety and ethics.\n\nThe university’s custodianship of the remains is currently subject to a legal challenge and therefore sub judice. Renewed testing amounts to what can only be described as a cavalier disregard of the legal process.\n\nMoreover, there has been no independent verification that these tests are either ethical or necessary. Indeed, the university has, in effect, authorised itself to conduct tests that are far from essential and will add very little to our useful knowledge of England’s last Plantagenet king.\n\nEssential initial testing to confirm the king’s identity was sanctioned by Philippa Langley of the Looking For Richard Project (who instigated and raised the funding for the archaeological search), in her contract with University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS).\n\nHowever, this came with a proviso: Philippa Langley’s contract with ULAS stated that any remains positively identified as Richard III would be transferred to her as custodian to be placed in a prayerful environment to await reburial.\n\nWe feel that the university has exhibited contempt for the judicial review process. We also feel that it has refused to honour a contract with Philippa Langley, freely entered into before the archaeological search began.\n\nThese are not appropriate actions for an academic institution. They raise legitimate concerns as to what future actions the university may take without suitable authorisation.\n\nDr John Ashdown-Hill, Annette Carson, Dr David and Wendy Johnson, Philippa Langley, Looking For Richard Project, Lawford, Essex\n\nIt’s the future that matters in Ulster\n\nClaire Dwyer Hogg (3 March) refers to the “on the run” letters given to Irish republicans, and the police investigations into Bloody Sunday, and asks: “How can justice be served if a terrorist and an employee of the state are given an equal level of accountability?”\n\nBut it is precisely this equality that was claimed by those employing the Armalite and the bomb in their cause of a united Ireland. They claimed, and continue to claim, that they acted as the agents of a future state, their actions sanctioned by a historical imperative that placed them on an equal footing with their British oppressors.\n\nLike so many groups that resort to violence as a means of achieving their ends, they got their feet under the table when it was time to pull the crackers and put on the paper hats. The rest of us just have to live with it, and no amount of commissions or apologies, convictions or “on the run” letters will change what actually happened.\n\nWhether or not any paratrooper is prosecuted over Bloody Sunday, Peter Hain is right to think that the future of us all matters a lot more than any one particular past.\n\nChristopher Dawes, London W11\n\nReduce the demand for prostitution\n\nI’m delighted that the UK Parliament’s all-party group on prostitution and the global sex trade is looking at solutions to prostitution which reduce demand (“Target punters, not prostitutes, say MPs”, 3 March). It’s high time Britain addressed the inequality that takes place when men buy women’s bodies for sex.\n\nThe notion that prostitution is the “oldest profession” leads some to believe we can do little more than regulate it better – that we should follow the example of Holland and decriminalise. But this leads to increased prostitution levels, normalising the inequalities which sustain the sex industry.\n\nRather than blanket legalisation we need the more nuanced approach already practised in Sweden. Recent changes in France and Ireland, as well as my report on the subject, which was accepted by the European Parliament last week, suggest the wind is blowing in this direction. Britain must be ambitious enough to follow suit.\n\nMary Honeyball, MEP, (Lab, London), London W9\n\nGive us more light in spring\n\nIf the Coalition is serious about green issues it can make an immediate saving of UK energy consumption by bringing forward the move to British Summer Time (BST) by four weeks.\n\nThe annual move to GMT in late October is approximately five weeks after the autumn equinox, while the reversion to BST is more than a week after the spring equinox. Even if successive governments have resisted shifting to Central European Time because of concerns about Scottish crofters, they have the opportunity to demonstrate their green credentials by changing the clocks in late February to provide an extra hour of daylight for an additional month in spring.\n\nDavid Bracey, Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire\n\nSpokesperson won’t speak\n\nA GCHQ spokeswoman responded to the latest creepy revelation about their work, that they hoovered up webcam images of millions of people: “We’re not commenting on anything.”\n\nGiven that the public debt is now over £1.2trn, would it be unreasonable to suggest that sacking such a spokesperson and saving whatever we pay her might provide modest fiscal relief?\n\nStuart Bonar, Plymouth\n\nSelling off London\n\nFor decades villages have been devastated as wealthy people have purchased holiday homes, pricing locals out of the market and destroying the community spirit, culture and language (especially in Wales). It is ironic that the same is now happening in “lights out London” (report, 3 March) as mega-rich foreigners buy up property not as dwellings but for investment.\n\nMike Stroud, Swansea\n\nTimes:\n\nSir, Sir Christopher Meyer urges us (Mar 3) to see the Ukrainian crisis through Moscow’s prism and says we should not make a drama out of “Crimea’s crisis”. Unfortunately, thanks to most of the UK media, we have had little chance to do anything else for the past month. This is not Crimea’s crisis, it is Ukraine’s crisis, but unrelentingly we hear interviews with so-called representatives of the Russian minority in Ukraine, who talk of the threat from “fascists”, as supporters of the Ukrainian revolution are termed, and argue that Yanukovych was a legally elected president. The BBC makes little effort to challenge such views.\n\nThe core of the Ukrainian revolution is formed by ordinary citizens. Most are left wing or moderate, not right wing; many are Russian-speakers or ethnic Russians, tired of the authoritarian kleptocracy run by Yanukovych. Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians are just as outraged by such excesses as Ukrainians, yet one would not know from the British media that there were Russian-speakers and ethnic Russians among those shot on the Maidan. We should not simply accept, as Sir Christopher appears to accept, Russia’s view of its history. Ukrainians are Ukrainians because they have resisted for centuries the idea that they form “part of the Russian nation”. Their voice should be heard.\n\nProfessor Robert Frost\n\nAberdeen\n\nSir, Christopher Meyer is right that we don’t have a dog in the Ukraine fight. Our government should cease its posturing about the gravest crisis of the century and talk of costs to Russia.\n\nThe US’s reaction would have been identical to Russia’s had the slightest threat arisen in an area where one of its fleets was based. After all, the US has been doing something not dissimilar in South America for decades.\n\nGeorge Healy\n\nLondon N16\n\nSir, Ukraine’s agony highlights the incompetence of EU “diplomacy” and the way that the premature entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU raised unwise expectations.\n\nIgnoring the corrupt failures of Ukraine’s leaders since the Orange Revolution, the special status of Crimea, the lessons of history and ethnicity, and the mind-sets of the ex-KGB rulers of Russia, not to mention the realpolitik of their holding all the geographic, economic, financial, military and energy supply cards, and to expect Ukraine to move near-seamlessly out of Russian influence and towards “Europe” overnight, displayed a worrying level of ignorance and naivety.\n\nSensible negotiations for gradually increasing ties with the EU should have kept Russian interests in the loop, including obvious points like a renewed pledge that Ukraine would not join Nato, as we promised Gorbachev. But the West’s strident rhetoric seems bent on exceeding even our Syrian own-goals; as long as we all depend on Russian oil and gas, Putin will reign supreme.\n\nJohn Birkett\n\nSt Andrews, Fife\n\nSir, Whatever is decided in the short term, the proper strategic response for the UK to Russia’s actions in Ukraine is to get fracking. A long-term and sustainable energy policy based on UK gas, nuclear and tidal power is long overdue.\n\nAndrew Lodge\n\nSalisbury\n\nThe UK must do its utmost to extirpate sexual violence against women and children as a weapon of war\n\nSir, In war zones sexual violence is as devastating as bullets and bombs.

For far too long these giant clubs have been excluded from England and a share of the richesse because they are Scottish. No other businesses are treated in such a discriminatory way, and it irks many Scots. If Cameron was smart enough, he could ensure that these clubs have a future in the UK and in so doing would increase the justification of their supporters to vote for the union. He might even get a Scottish seat at the next general election for his efforts.\n\nProfessor Richard Goldberg\n\nEdinburgh\n\nThe government must understand that nowadays broadband really is just as vital as all the other utilities\n\nSir, It must be impressed upon the government that broadband really is now a “vital fourth utility” after gas water and electricity (“How a slow internet can shrink your house value”, Mar 3).\n\nWe in Easton, near Wells, have been without broadband connection or landline for over four months. You quoted the property expert Henry Pryor as saying that without broadband, “you’ll struggle with a whole heap of stuff”. He is right. We and eight other households have struggled. Mobile signal is erratic so matters are even worse. Only this morning we were assured by BT that we would be connected. The engineer from BT Openreach had other ideas. There seems to be no communication between one branch of BT and another. This has been the case since last October. Can the country really afford such a shambles?\n\nAnne N. Barnsley-Roberts\n\nEaston, Somerset\n\nCornwall may have its own word for tomorrow but it has to share some of its linguistic treasures with other regions\n\nSir, Fossick, cack and fizzogg are Cornish words (Mar 3)? All three were in common parlance in the 1950s and 1960s in Hartlepool, and at least two of them are still used in these parts. Fizzogg is surely an abbreviation of physiognomy, and that isn’t Cornish either.\n\nArthur Pickering\n\nHartlepool\n\nSir, It is not just Cornwall that has a regionally specific word for mañana. Here in West Berkshire tradesmen make full use of “somewhen” meaning “yes, they will be coming, but in their own good time”.\n\nDavid Shamash\n\nSouth Fawley, W Berks\n\nTelegraph:\n\nSIR – John Bingham was one of our most remarkable Second World War spies. The M15 documents that have just been released (“Spy who turned Hitler’s British supporters into unwitting double agents”, report, February 28) show the scale of his achievement in neutralising the espionage of British fascists, who were more widespread than is supposed.\n\nThis modest hero, who was also the 7th Baron Clanmorris – an Ulster title without property – was not treated as respectfully as he deserved by his protégé, John le Carré, who immortalised him as George Smiley. He was hurt by the portrayal of his secret world in the novels.\n\nThe author, Bingham once said, “was my friend, but I deplore and hate everything he has done and said against the intelligence services”. No one cared more about his country and its institutions than John Bingham, to whom we owe so much.\n\nLord Lexden\n\nLondon SW1\n\nSIR – For poor children, getting ahead in life comes less from “acting posh”, as your report put it, and more from being better educated.\n\nBut there is no doubt that those working-class pupils who do study in the independent sector, thanks to a scholarship or bursary, gain some of the social skills referred to by Peter Brant, the head of policy at the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, as well as benefiting from a well-rounded education.\n\nThe Society of Heads’ Futures Group, which I chair, has been discussing strategies for widening access to our schools, though we are painfully aware that there are political mountains to climb in order to achieve this. Very few independent school heads would not do more for deserving children from working-class backgrounds given the opportunity, though this does not seem to have been high up on the Adonis-Gove agenda.\n\nRoland Martin\n\nHeadmaster, Rendcomb College\n\nCirencester, Gloucestershire\n\nSIR – We are a socially and culturally diverse nation. For Peter Brant to suggest that the working classes don’t know how to hold a knife and fork, and are therefore not likely to succeed in life, is insulting.\n\nEmma Isworth\n\nElmfield, Kent\n\nSIR – One way to ensure social mobility would be for the Government to bring back assisted places in private schools.\n\nKate Graeme-Cook\n\nTarrant Launceston, Dorset\n\nSpring is sprung\n\nSIR – Spring arrived at 7.50am on March 1, when I heard my first skylark of the year singing joyfully high in the sky.\n\nRoger Boyce\n\nDornoch, Sutherland\n\nSIR – Last week I heard the familiar rasping call of the Crested Mountfield and, later from an adjoining garden, the persistent hum of the Lesser Strimmer.\n\nMalcolm Allen\n\nBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR – I know spring has arrived when I can see the star Arcturus, low in the east, for the first time each year.\n\nIf I want to feel as though spring has arrived a bit earlier, I simply look out for Arcturus a bit later in the evening.\n\nGeoffrey White\n\nWellow, Somerset\n\nFreemasons’ charity\n\nSIR – I find the ruling that Freemasonry cannot be classed as a charitable institution to be puzzling.\n\nChurches have charitable status and are classed as “exempt charities” in the Schedule 3 list of the Charities Act. This means that they do not have to register with the Charity Commission to enjoy all the tax benefits associated with this.\n\nIt is estimated that between 25 and 30 per cent of the United Grand Lodge of England’s charitable donations go to causes with no Masonic connections. Having been a churchwarden, I know that “wholly philanthropic” giving to outside causes by the Church of England falls far short of that practised by the Masons. So where is the even-handedness in the judge’s ruling?\n\nFrazer Walker\n\nTern Hill, Shropshire\n\nOn-the-spot justice\n\nSIR – When I was a police officer, some magistrates’ courts were connected by a tunnel to the police station. Any offender detained the afternoon or night before would be taken to court the following morning to be dealt with.\n\nVery often, the magistrate would bind over an offender to ensure good behaviour. This was excellent because the offender knew he was being watched.\n\nMagistrates were on call to turn out on Saturday and Sunday to deal with any arrests overnight. Now, because many police stations have been sold, justice has to be dispensed weeks afterwards, sometimes miles away.\n\nNeville H Walker\n\nAtherstone, Warwickshire\n\nHonest taxes\n\nSIR – Top of my list of renamed taxes would be VAT. Call it sales tax, as they do in America, and show it separately on every receipt, so that consumers know what they are actually paying for. I have just paid an outrageous sum to the Government for the privilege of moving house; maybe we could change stamp duty to “property purchase tax”.\n\nPaula Bates\n\nTunbridge Wells, Kent\n\nAvoiding high parking costs at Wakehurst Place\n\nSIR – Tony Saunders is mistaken in his belief that charging for car parking could backfire at Wakehurst Place in Sussex. At present, the National Trust pays little, if anything, towards the expense of maintaining the garden, so the absence of National Trust visitors would have very little effect.\n\nHowever, with an annual pass, which costs little more than twice the entry fee, a car may be parked there every day for a year. Without the revenue from parking, the garden might have to close.\n\nBernard Breese\n\nLingfield, Surrey\n\nSIR – My husband and I have been members of the National Trust for about 20 years. We were amazed to discover that from next month, Wakehurst Place is going to charge for car parking, making this a “no-go” day out for many people.\n\nThe extra parking charge, an unwelcome added expense for many families, ourselves included, will no doubt affect visitor numbers. People will race round so they only have to pay for one hour’s parking; this means they will not make use of the restaurant, a lucrative side to the business.\n\nIt will be a shame if visitors are not able to appreciate the wonderful array of flowers and plants that grow in profusion because of time constraints.\n\nGill Hill\n\nEast Grinstead, West Sussex\n\nSIR – May I suggest that Mr Saunders changes his loyalty to Polesden Lacey in Surrey, where I am a volunteer steward. There is a large shop, a wonderful restaurant and gardens, as well as a beautiful house.\n\nChristopher Bishop\n\nFetcham, Surrey\n\nSIR – Perhaps we might be in a better position to defend independent Ukraine from a bellicose Russia if the Coalition had not sent several of our aircraft carriers, along with the Harrier jump jets, to the scrapyard. Ark Royal could now be en route to the Black Sea rather than meeting her end in a Turkish scrapyard and being turned into razor blades.\n\nAs it stands, thanks to the cuts, Britain barely has the resources to maintain her existing military commitments, let alone launch a new adventure.\n\nAnthony Rodriguez\n\nStaines-upon-Thames, Middlesex\n\nSIR – David Cameron said: “There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine – a point I made to President Putin when we spoke yesterday”.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBetter education is the key to social mobility\n\n04 Mar 2014\n\nThe wartime spy who never wanted to be Smiley\n\n04 Mar 2014\n\nThis reminds me of Peter Sellers saying he was “totally against the Second World War and wrote a letter saying so”. Sadly for Mr Cameron, Britain’s global influence has been diluted by the emasculation of our Armed Forces, while our international political strength has been transferred enthusiastically to Brussels.\n\nPeter Ferguson\n\nHertford\n\nSIR – Our pompous Foreign Secretary goes to Kiev as though he were Lord Palmerston. We should keep out of this and leave it to the Continentals, especially the Germans, to make fools of themselves by making threats with no means of backing them up.\n\nThe situation is analogous to Turkey’s invasion of Northern Cyprus, and a similar partition is the likely (and perhaps not unreasonable) solution.\n\nDr Peter Greenhalgh\n\nSouthfleet, Kent\n\nSIR – Requiring the Ukrainian people to choose between the EU and Russia rather than link with both has been partly to blame for the current situation.\n\nRussia sending in troops has now raised the adversarial stakes. In the days before the EU, various treaty-linked countries would be mobilising armies and digging trenches. The shortcomings of the EU are always justified on the basis of its preventing wars in Europe. Let’s see.\n\nGodfrey Cromwell\n\nDirector, British East-West Centre\n\nLondon SW1\n\nSIR – Russia’s underlying worry is about Ukraine joining Nato. Russia does not want missiles placed in its backyard, any more than America desired this in Cuba in 1962.\n\nWhy not reassure Russia that Ukraine will not be admitted to Nato, but that she will be left to work out her own destiny, with both Russia and the West standing as guarantors of her neutrality?\n\nAndrew Norman\n\nPoole, Dorset\n\nSIR – Recent developments in Ukraine and the effective Russian invasion of Crimea are a direct consequence of President Barack Obama’s failure to maintain peace through strength and his taking a feeble attitude towards international crises. Russia should not have been allowed even to consider invading a free sovereign state.\n\nIt is lucky that Mr Obama was not the president during the Cold War or we would all be either ruled by Moscow by now or obliterated by nuclear holocaust. Britain must prevent international disaster and lead from the front, forcing Nato to protect Ukraine and maintain peace.\n\nKieran Bailey\n\nBristol\n\nSIR – Is the President Putin now violating the borders of Ukraine the same one who wouldn’t allow aid into Syria because it might violate national boundaries?\n\nAnn Salmon\n\nChiltington, West Sussex\n\nSIR – Did John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, really just criticise Russia for “invading another country on a phony pretext”?\n\nBharat Jashanmal\n\nFairford, Gloucestershire\n\nIrish Times:\n\nSir, – Notwithstanding the goodwill of pro-European enthusiasts (among whom I would number myself), the reality is that the eastward expansion of the EU is accompanied by the onward march of Nato. The US has signed treaties with Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic to install land-based SM-3 missiles as part of its European defence strategy. Is Vladimir Putin being entirely unreasonable to expect similar treaties could follow Ukraine’s move into the western sphere of influence?\n\nWhen any gang of street protesters drive a legitimately elected government from office they necessarily teach their fellow citizens the lesson that authority comes, not from the democratic will of the people, but from force majeure .\n\nThe people of Ukraine now face the prospect of a civil war even more savage than that in Syria, and all those who urged them into this chaotic position must share in the responsibility for the countless deaths and outrages against the innocent to which it may well lead.\n\nInstead of reaching for familiar bogeymen to beat, well-intentioned leaders and commentators should urge the maintenance of civilised norms, the immediate resumption of meaningful negotiations and a genuine rapprochement with the elected president and all those millions of now disenfranchised citizens who voted for him.\n\nThe current provisional government in Kiev has no legal authority and it should not be regarded as the sole voice that speaks for Ukraine. All voices should be heard.\n\nWhen western commentators poke the bear, it is innocent civilians in eastern Europe who will feels the claws on their back.\n\nThere is never a bad time to argue for peace. – Yours, etc,\n\nARTHUR DEENY,\n\nRock Road,\n\nBlackrock,\n\nCo Dublin.\n\nSir, – The big loser from the 1853-1856 Crimean War was uninvolved Austria.\n\nWho will it be this time? – Yours, etc,\n\nDr JOHN DOHERTY,\n\nOperngasse,\n\nVienna.\n\nA chara, – Perhaps Dermot Mac Murchada was the inspiration for Viktor Yanukovych’s supposed invitation for a Russian invasion.\n\nStand by for an interesting 800 years. – Is mise,\n\nSEÁN Ó MATHÚNA,\n\nWestcourt Heights,\n\nBaile an Chollaigh,\n\nCo Chorcaí.\n\nA chara, – I believe the Coalition plan for universal health insurance (UHI) is a confidence trick. I feel that Irish people are slowly realising this too. The reality will be yet another bitter pill for hard-pressed Irish taxpayers.\n\nThe current cohort of privately insured individuals in Ireland has reduced in the last five years by about 40,000 per year to the current level of 44 per cent of the population.\n\nThis is purely because people can no longer afford to pay for their health insurance.\n\nThe other 56 per cent depends upon a dysfunctional and underfunded public system to supply the current “basket” of services.\n\nThe Government would have us believe that by donating €1,600 from our dwindling pay packets we will buy a fit for purpose, safe health system for all. This €1,600 will pay for access to a standard “basket “of services but if any extra services are needed then top-up payments to the basic charge will apply.\n\nSo, we will move from a two-tier system, where 44 per cent pay a large amount to circumvent the HSE-run public system, to a new two-tier system, where 44 per cent pay a similar amount to avail of what essentially is currently supplied by the HSE.\n\nThey will then have to pay even more to escape the inevitable chaos that will ensue.\n\nTherefore with UHI (Irish -style) we will have the same two-tier system, except that the wallet of the tax-paying mortgage holder will be another €1,600 lighter. – Is mise,\n\nDr DÓNAL PUNCH,\n\nSecretary,\n\nNational Association\n\nof General Practitioners ,\n\nMayfield Family Practice,\n\nMayfield, Cork.\n\nSir, – The Government recently introduced the home renovation incentive (HRI) scheme with the twin aims of boosting the struggling construction sector and combating the black economy, by offering home owners a rebate on the VAT element of the costs of renovating. On both counts, this is a very positive proposal which will be welcomed by hard-pressed taxpayers.\n\nHowever, the complicated implementation of the scheme may be its undoing.\n\nIn short, it works like this: I find a building contractor to carry out the works, and he provides me with various certificates to show that he is tax-compliant. When the job is complete and paid for, I provide him with my local property tax property ID. The contractor must go online and enter all the details of the job within 28 days of completion. However, I won’t get an immediate VAT refund, but I will receive an additional income tax credit over the following two years for the value of the VAT element of the costs.\n\nGetting a detailed, written quote from a builder can be difficult, as can a final invoice or receipt, so I can see some problems persuading a contractor to go through this HRI process online. There is, of course, a far simpler way to save on VAT which has been with us for quite some time. Which one would you choose? – Yours, etc,\n\nPAUL WALDRON,\n\nWoodpark,\n\nBallinteer, Dublin 16.\n\nSir, – EF Fanning’s use of the Census 2011 language question (February 26th) illustrates a statistical anomaly with a self-selective question such as how often people speak Gaelic, which tends to favour romantic sentimentalism over scientific accuracy. It is highly likely that most of the 119,000 Polish speakers are actually fluent in that language. I sincerely doubt the same could be said of the 1.77 million people who claim to be able to speak Gaelic. But the 1.77 million includes schoolchildren.\n\nIn fact, only 77,185 people, or 1.7 per cent of the population, claimed to use Gaelic on a daily basis outside of school. It is probable that there are more daily users of Polish than Gaelic. Perhaps the question could be rephrased to ask if you are fluent in Gaelic, or maybe the question should be asked in Gaelic on the English form to see how many people are able to answer it.\n\nSpeaking of the English form, for Census 2011 people were offered the choice of the English or Gaelic form. A total of 1,654,447 English forms were collected, whereas only a measly 7,806 Gaelic forms were collected. Or, to put it another way, only 0.47 per cent of census forms were the Gaelic version!\n\nInstead of lecturing English speakers, criticising Government for lack of services, or demanding more force-feeding, perhaps Gaelgoirí should start with themselves and actually use the Gaelic form for Census 2016. – Yours, etc,\n\nJASON FITZHARRIS,\n\nRivervalley,\n\nSir, – What a pleasure to read the inspiring letter by Diarmuid O’Flynn (February 28th) on the determined and dignified weekly protest by the people of Ballyhea. They continue to highlight how the Irish people were used to prop up an economic system which perpetuates inequality. We were sold a story that reforms would be implemented to mitigate future speculative financial-based bubbles. We were asked to accept that additional tax burdens could not be imposed on the rich as they needed the financial flexibility to invest and create jobs. Since 2008 there have been no reforms of note in the financial markets, inequality has increased, as revealed by the recent Oxfam report, and, as we have seen in the past week with the liquidation of IBRC, the needs of ordinary people are relegated as an inconvenience to expediency. How ironic then that this week the IMF issued a report stating that inequality was detrimental to growth and that wealth redistribution was economically more beneficial. The irony comes from the observation that the IMF was a key early facilitator of the global roll-out of Milton Friedman’s free market model, which has produced a system of repeated bubbles of increasing severity and resulted in massive inequity. The people of Ballyhea should stand proud each Sunday as they continue to remind us of the dysfunctional nature of this system and the impotence of our elected elite in confronting this reality. – Yours, etc,\n\nBARRY WALSH,\n\nLinden Avenue,\n\nBlackrock, Cork.\n\nA chara, – Some countries have wordless national anthems. Spain has La Marcha Real . I can think of one eminently suitable rousing air, which could serve as an anthem acceptable to both traditions on this island.\n\nI refer to Marcaíocht na Bóinne , or to give it its English title, Boyne Water , an air beloved of Orange Order bands, as it originally commemorated the time “when King William came over the Boyne water, on July the first in Oldbridge town”, the self same air to which in 1745 Piaras Mac Gearailt wrote the ever popular Rosc Catha na Mumhan .\n\nNot just rugby, but the whole country should adopt it, and have it replace the much less historical and, if I am allowed to say so, the much less traditional sounding Amhrán na bhFiann . – Is mise,\n\nFr SEÁN Ó COINN,\n\nGort Leitreach,\n\nMaothail,\n\nCo Liatroma.\n\nSir, – The Irish rugby team does not represent the “Republic of Ireland” only; it is an “all-island” entity, its membership drawn from two distinct (and mutually recognised, by the way) political jurisdictions. Logically, then, if anthems are to be played, both A Soldier’s Song and God Save the Queen should feature at Ireland matches.\n\nThis, of course, could give rise to problems from the flat-earthers who still await the “reintegration of the national territory”. The compromise (like all such, to no-one’s complete satisfaction) was the appalling ditty with which we are currently lumbered. But why do we need anthems at all? Playing for Ireland is now a professional activity, lucratively paid and every inch commercially sponsored.\n\nThe games are Roman entertainments, with fireworks, “celebrity” acts, and goodness knows what else. There is little dignity left. Do we actually want the concept and ownership of civic and national pride to be associated with such gladiatorial exhibition matches? – Yours, etc,\n\nIAN d’ALTON,\n\nRathasker Heights,\n\nNaas,\n\nCo Kildare.\n\nSir, – Amhrán na bhFiann has become the national anthem of Ireland? Was there another secret letter from Tony Blair? Surely not? – Yours, etc,\n\nALAN LOWTHER,\n\nAvondale Road,\n\nKilliney,\n\nSir, – Jonathan Hession (February 28th) writes, “So, Fáilte Ireland is planning to erect 4,000 road signs along our 2,500km western coastline, in an attempt to attract tourism”. I seem to recall another wing of the State removing one famous road sign in Ballyvaughan, Co Clare, because it constituted a health and safety issue, despite having been photographed by visitors from all over the word and appearing in Fáilte Ireland tourism brochures. It’s a crazy little country we live in. – Yours, etc,\n\nDONAL CARLIN,\n\nBallyconnell,\n\nCo Cavan.\n\nSir, – The countryside and the urban environment are now cluttered with signs, bollards, galvanised poles and traffic lights. There seems to be no coordination between the councils and the National Roads Authority, and other agencies such as Fáilte Ireland.\n\nIt is not just rural councils that seem to have no sense of the landscape. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has covered every square inch of pavement with poles and signs.\n\nSaving our towns and villages from the galvanised pole needs urgent attention. As so much attention is now been given to our beaches and the blue flags, let’s also give the rural and urban landscapes the attention they deserve. – Yours, etc,\n\nNEIL BURKE-KENNEDY,\n\nRock Road,\n\nBlackrock,\n\nCo Dublin.\n\nSir, – There must have been a pot of money for signage on the Wild Atlantic Way. The Letterkenny to Buncrana section is littered with Wild Atlantic Way signage, some within yards of each other and adding nothing to one’s navigation of the route. In the days of maps, we suffered from a shortage of signage, but certainly not now. – Yours, etc,\n\nANN SHANNON,\n\nTara Court,\n\nLetterkenny,\n\nSir, – The possibility of further post office closures, with devastating effects on rural communities, is a complete indictment of the management of An Post.\n\nAn organisation whose personnel are welcomed at every door, which has a prominent retail presence in every town and village, and which controls a massive national distribution network, has almost unlimited commercial potential. However, it continues to depend upon dwindling mail, State contracts and substantial Government support for its teetering existence.\n\nThe workforce and infrastructure of An Post have the capacity to be self-sufficient.\n\nThat will only be achieved when An Post’s management realises that they should heed their own slogan and “do more”. Much, much more! – Yours, etc,\n\nPETER COOGAN,\n\nTemple Manor,\n\nCelbridge,\n\nCo Kildare.\n\nSir, – Philip O’Reilly (March 1st) is quite wrong in stating that election posters serve no useful purpose. After each election I collect about 20 or so at random (including ties!) and they often come in handy. Indeed, when the recent hurricane blew in the glass in my living-room window, I was immediately able to make it weather-tight with a poster of a prominent TD. My neighbour’s comment on seeing it summed it rather neatly: “It’s the most useful thing the man has ever done.”\n\nPerhaps election posters of sitting TDs should by law remain permanently on posts – just to remind people every day exactly who is responsible for the mess the country is in? – Yours, etc,\n\nBILL BAILEY,\n\nKilcascan,\n\nBallineen, Co Cork.\n\nSir, – I have just finished reading Kathy Sheridan’s article for the fourth time (Weekend, March 1st). I find something new every time I read it. I am impressed and humbled by her stoic yet so honest report on her illness. It should be read by all.\n\nI have never encountered an article which so honestly projected the horror and sheer tedium of this unfair and random illness. I love her work and long may she thrive to provide it. – Yours, etc,\n\nCELINE ROCHE,\n\nHawthorn Place,\n\nClybaun Road,\n\nGalway.\n\nA chara, – In his letter of March 3rd, Brendan Butler must be unaware that the Archbishop of Tuam has circulated feedback received from his archdiocese to the recent church survey in the spring edition of New Dawn , the esteemed Tuam archdiocesan publication. Apologies are in order at least to Dr Neary (and perhaps to other diocesan pastors) in light of the remarks in Mr Butler’s letter indicating that “Archbishop Martin is the only bishop . . . to publish the results”.

The Crimean peninsula is of vital strategic importance to Russia, due to its vital access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\nIt is likely that Russia could have lived with a pro-western government in Kiev developing closer economic ties with the West, but it was the spectre of Ukraine joining NATO thereby sealing off Russian strategic access to the south that was always going to be unacceptable.\n\nA total of 23 EU member states are also full NATO members and the others are members of NATO’s so-called Partnership for Peace, so Russia views the EU as being synonymous with NATO. A peaceful solution to the East/West divide in Ukraine should have been to declare Ukraine a constitutionally neutral state, as Austria and Finland are.\n\nThis would have allowed for economic co-operation with both Russia and the EU without threatening Russian strategic interests. This opportunity has now been lost. Nothing was learnt from the Georgian/Russian war in 2008.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, President Bush said in Kiev that both Ukraine and Georgia should be allowed to join NATO despite objections from Russia. In August 2008, Russia annexed Abkhazia and South Ossetia, provinces of Georgia.\n\nIf the Russian de facto annexation of Crimea leads to violent conflict with Ukraine, Russia may also seek to annex a slice of eastern Ukraine from Kharkiv to the Crimea.\n\nEamon Gilmore described the situation as the most serious European crisis since the end of the Cold War.

Wards were redesigned on an open plan and railings removed. Intensely fond of music and theatre himself, Rollin instituted dance classes, inviting musicians and actors from outside to participate. He set up the hospital’s first outpatient clinic, and organised an active schedule of trips and sporting events for those who would otherwise have been confined. Under his leadership, Horton became the leading hospital in the country for music therapy.\n\nRollin was also a staunch critic of “care in the community”, as set out by Enoch Powell in 1961, frequently pointing out that the community “did not care”. While the then health minister painted a vividly gloomy picture of the era’s mental institutions, understaffed and run according to outdated ideals, Rollin saw a system in need of improvement and expansion, not widespread closure; the alternative facilities struck him as largely unworkable. By the end of the 1960s many of the beds at Horton had been lost, and Rollin left the NHS for a consultant forensic psychiatrist position with the Home Office in 1976.\n\nNot that Rollin regarded the prevailing wisdom of the psychiatric community and its institutions as unassailable. He felt deep regret over many procedures that were accepted practice during his years at Horton, such as the prefrontal leucotomy – the severing of connections between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain, which often caused a chronic lack of inhibition in patients. The first psychoactive drugs, such as chlorpromazine, had alarming side effects; and he regarded the emerging fashion for Freudian psychoanalysis with suspicion, identifying in some of its proponents a “religious reverence” at odds with his own highly theoretical and practical frame of mind.\n\nAbove all, however, he had no patience for the authorities who devoted scant attention and slender resources to the provision of mental health services, while attempts at reorganisation proved fraught. “Doctors and their patients, may I remind them, are not packets of soap-flakes that can be moved from one shelf to the next shelf or from one shop to the next shop with impunity,” he wrote, to the British Medical Journal . “Do I sound disenchanted, disillusioned, or even a trifle paranoid? I am. I bloody well am.”\n\nHenry Rapoport Rollin was born in Glasgow on November 17 1911. His father, a cabinet-maker from Lithuania and trade union leader who spoke four languages, instilled in Henry a lifelong enthusiasm for books and reading. The boy spent his formative years in Leeds and, at the encouragement of his family, studied Medicine at Leeds University, qualifying for clinical work in 1935. It was not a happy experience, and things did not improve with his first position, as a house surgeon for Oldham Royal Infirmary . To escape he enlisted as a ship’s doctor, and in June 1938 sailed to Japan and back on board the MV Memnon.\n\nStill lacking direction after his return, he applied to become an assistant medical officer to the LCC mental health service, where he discovered psychiatry. He wrote his MD thesis on Down’s syndrome, studied psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital and published his first paper in the Journal of Mental Science (precursor to the British Journal of Psychiatry) in 1941.\n\nAfter acquiring his diploma in Psychological Medicine he joined the RAF as a squadron leader, later rising to wing commander. Before long he was recruited to the team headed by Air Commodore RD Gillespie, one of country’s most eminent neuropsychiatrists, and posted to a WAAF depot with the task of eliminating recruits likely to break down under the stress of training. Later he was transferred to RAF medical headquarters in London, where he had the “agonising” job of distinguishing between genuine mental illness and “lack of moral fibre” among the patients.\n\nUpon his discharge from the RAF he was posted briefly to Cane Hill Hospital, Surrey, where he completed his MD, before taking up the deputy superintendent post at Horton. A 1953 Fulbright fellowship to study psychoanalysis in the United States provided him with invaluable insight into the patient-led model of care, but confirmed his scepticism of the psychoanalyst’s prominence in treatment at the time.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the NHS, Rollin was swiftly approached by the Home Office to work as a consultant forensic psychiatrist, a position he held for the next 10 years. He also served on numerous mental health tribunals, becoming only the second member of the Parole Board to hold a psychiatric qualification after its establishment by Roy Jenkins under the 1967 Criminal Justice Act.\n\nIn the same period he was the sessional psychiatrist at Brixton prison, where he became an authority on mentally abnormal offenders, once fending off attack from a former boxing champion whom he had been trying to assess. Though a skilled boxer himself in his youth, Rollin was able to defuse the situation without recourse to violence. His interest in the field resulted in a Gwilym Gibbon research fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, with Professor Nigel Walker.\n\nRollin was elected a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1976 and a Fellow in 1983.\n\nThe author of three books and some 50 editorials in the British Medical Journal, he was also obituaries editor for the British Journal of Psychiatry until the year of his death. Throughout the 1970s he was a regular contributor to the now-defunct World Medicine, then one of the mostly widely read publications of its kind.\n\nRollin was a leading figure in the fundraising necessary to elevate the Royal Medico-Psychological Association to Royal College status and in the purchase of the college’s first home at 17 Belgrave Square. He built up the library there while serving on many committees and as Librarian for 10 years. Another of his roles was to lead study tours to Denmark, France, Italy and Mexico. A foundation Fellow, on his retirement he was elected to Honorary Fellowship, the College’s highest honour.\n\nShortly before his departure from the NHS, Rollin had, by his own account, “a late flowering” when he met Anna-Maria Tihanyi, a medical student who became a prominent consultant anaesthetist. They married in 1973 and had three children.\n\nHe continued to enjoy opera and theatre in London, followed by a salt beef sandwich, into his final year.\n\nHenry Rollin, born November 17 1911, died February 6 2014\n\nGuardian:\n\nAs the one responsible for the statistic that just 11 people have been killed by earthquakes in Britain, I should point out that it is not the case that these died “mainly from falling masonry” (Shelves shaken and cats stirred as south-west hit by earthquake, 21 February). Four did, including two doubtful cases. Two have been killed by falling rock in mines or quarries, two by falling down and three from heart failure. However, we have no figures for the numbers killed by medieval earthquakes, discounting some reports now known to be spurious. The most curious case is that of Mary Saunders, who was so depressed after the Colchester earthquake of 1884 that she drowned herself in the river Stour a few days later.\n\nRoger Musson\n\nEdinburgh\n\n• Great to know that Catherine Samba-Panza, the new interim leader of crisis-ridden Central African Republic, wears red nail varnish (The woman with just one year to address the woes of a failed state, 3 March).

As anyone from north of Newport Pagnell can tell you, beetroot belongs in vinegar, in a jar. All else is madness. Please could the nation’s chefs find a new hobbyhorse to ride and/or eat.\n\nRoot Cartwright\n\nRadlett, Hertfordshire\n\n• My Poo kept falling out of bed (different teddy bear, different spelling). However, the joke began to pall, so as children we were instructed to go to the toilet to do big jobs. Now that could work: the Big Jobs party (Letters, 3 March).\n\nJacky Miles\n\nDiss, Norfolk\n\nI read with increasing queasiness the story of Mark Wood, an employment and support allowance (ESA) claimant with mental health problems, whose death by starvation was largely attributable to the Atos assessment of his being fit for work and the subsequent stopping of his sickness benefits (Vulnerable man starved to death after cut to benefits, 1 March).\n\nYears after the Holocaust, ordinary German citizens were called upon by the younger generation to justify themselves: Surely you knew what was going on? Why didn’t you put a stop to it?\n\nI hope I may crave an indulgence to use your paper to put on public record that I was one of those opposed to this government’s policy of abscission against the vulnerable. I submitted to the Harrington reviews on ESA and its assessment processes. I inveighed against the callous manipulation of public attitudes against claimants by the popular press that has driven many people to turn a blind eye to the real agenda. And it is in vain that I now look towards other political parties to protect the weak, when they so obviously realise that the propaganda battle has been lost.\n\nThe benefits system has failed those that have most needed help for decades, but it has not until now sought to eradicate them entirely.\n\nSimon Wagener\n\nWallasey, Merseyside\n\n• Your article quotes a DWP spokesman stating: “A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment and after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence from the claimant’s GP or medical specialist”. But the DWP does not itself request medical documentation, and it is up to the ESA claimants to produce it. Reasons for claimants not doing this include them assuming the DWP has requested medical records, claimants not realising the importance of such records, and disability such as depression or psychosis resulting in default.\n\nAssessors rely on claimants to say what their medical illnesses are, but claimants sometimes give the wrong diagnoses and often don’t understand the complexity of their illnesses. Although Atos assessors fill in a “medical report form”, Atos nurses and physiotherapists far outnumber medical practitioners. Even when hospital records are obtained, the nurse/physiotherapist may not understand important details eg that an eGFR of 17 means that renal function is severely impaired. Without medical records, the Atos medical practitioner assessors also make decisions having woefully inadequate information. On appeal to first-tier tribunals, a significant proportion of sessions are adjourned to get medical evidence covering several years. A “thorough assessment” it is habitually not.\n\nMorris Bernadt\n\nLondon\n\n• Following the death of Mark Wood, who starved to death after his benefits were withdrawn, it is surely time for a citizen’s arrest campaign targeting Iain Duncan Smith. The death of Mr Wood, who was disabled, follows the call for a woman in a coma to attend job training, and cuts to benefits after letters were sent to a blind man that he could not read. The responsibility for these appalling infringements of basic human rights lies squarely with the minister who designed and implemented the system. Could legal experts please advise on the case for charging him with manslaughter? I would be happy to place a hand on his shoulder.\n\nNicola Grove\n\nHorningsham, Wiltshire\n\n• Our twin 41-year-old sons, who have learning difficulties, epilepsy and other problems, have just been informed that they will have to reapply for their welfare benefits through a process conducted on behalf of the coalition government by the French-owned private company Atos.\n\nDr Giles Youngs, who wrote a letter to the Guardian (19 February) about his recent resignation as a medical assessor for Atos, in which he referred to “unrealistic criteria, set by the DWP, for a claimant being awarded employment and support allowance”, is absolutely right in expressing his concerns that people with disabilities are unlikely to be given even a job interview, never mind a job. Despite the Disability Discrimination Act, discrimination still continues, eg in February 1999 we arranged for one of our sons to meet the North Wales personnel manager of the Benefits Agency, requesting that he give our son work experience in its Wrexham office. At the interview the manager said that although they had given work experience to physically disabled people, they had never done so for a person with a learning disability. We heard no more from him.\n\nWhat confidence, if any, should all disability welfare claimants now have of the work capability assessment in light of Dr Youngs’ revealing and damning indictment of both Atos and the DWP?\n\nKen and Mary Mack\n\n(72-year-old unpaid carers), Wrexham\n\n• We are beginning to see the results of several years of campaigning against unjust welfare reforms that target disabled people. But Atos attempting to pull out of its contract (Report, 22 February) represents only a partial victory. Other private corporations are already lining up to take over. So long as the work capability assessment (WCA) regime continues, so will the misery it causes to disabled people and their families, and to the workers involved in implementing a system they don’t agree with.\n\nThe WCA should be replaced immediately with a rigorous and safe system that does not cause avoidable harm to disabled people or those with chronic health issues or terminal illnesses. The UK government and opposition should follow the Scottish government’s pledge that private for-profit companies are removed entirely from having anything to do with the assessment of disabled people. This area of public policy belongs firmly within the NHS and the public sector.\n\nThe PIP contract must be removed from Atos with immediate effect: targets in its handling of the WCA have affected thousands of disabled people, leading to hastened deaths, waits of up to a year, and leaving people without income or food.\n\nLinda Burnip Co-founder, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nTracey Lazard CEO, Inclusion London\n\nJohn McArdle Co-founder, Black Triangle\n\nMark Serwotka General secretary, PCS Union\n\nFrances O’Grady General secretary, TUC\n\nJohn McDonnell MP\n\nLen McCluskey General secretary, Unite\n\nFrancesca Martinez WOW petition\n\nPat Onions Pat’s Petition\n\nRosemary O’Neill CarerWatch\n\nSean Vernell National secretary, Unite the Resistance\n\nEileen Short Chair, National Anti Bedroom Tax and Benefit Justice Federation\n\nRev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty\n\nClaire Glasman WinVisible (women with visible & invisible disabilities)\n\nAriane Sacco WinVisible\n\nMark Harrison CEO, Equal Lives\n\nKevin Caulfield Chair, Hammersmith and Fulham Coalition Against Cuts\n\nRahel Geffen CEO, Disability Action in Islington\n\nLyla Adwan-Kamara Merton Centre for Independent Living\n\nShaun O’Regan Southwark Benefit Justice Campaign\n\nBarry McDonald Chair, Bromley Experts by Experience\n\nIan Hodson National president, Bakers Food & Allied Workers Union\n\nRonnie Draper General secretary, Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union\n\nMick Carney National president, Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association\n\nManuel Cortes General secretary, Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association\n\nSean McGovern Unite executive councillor\n\nRob Murthwaite Equalities rep, UCU London region\n\nMike Cox Norfolk Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nDr Stephen Carty Medical adviser, Black Triangle Campaign\n\nDebbie Jolly Co-founder, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nAndy Greene Islington Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nEllen Clifford Croydon Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nPaula Peters Bromley Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nConan Doyle London Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nBob Ellard National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nAnita Bellows National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nCiara Doyle National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nRoger Lewis National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cuts\n\nJane Bence WOW petition\n\nRick Burgess WOW petition\n\nSimon Jenkins is mistaken in suggesting that I am soliciting tabloid column inches in relation to the sentence handed to Lewis Gill and is wrong to say that I have announced I will be appealing against the sentence (Politics, not law, has become the master of British justice, 28 February).\n\nI have made no such announcement, and am still considering whether the sentence should be referred to the court of appeal. While my office has received nearly 500 requests for me to consider whether Mr Gill’s sentence is unduly lenient, that has no bearing on my decision. Only one person needs to ask me to consider a sentence and if they do, it will receive the same close scrutiny as if 1,000 people had asked me. If I were to refer the case, it would then be considered by three senior judges, and it would be they who would decide if the sentence was unduly lenient or not.\n\nFacts and the law are the masters in this process: that is the only way to ensure justice is properly served.\n\nDominic Grieve QC MP\n\nAttorney general\n\nWe are extremely concerned by the response of the international community to the popular protests that have erupted against almost two decades of misrule in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Editorial, 17 February). Western media and politicians have argued that now is not the time for the western powers to disengage from Bosnia.\n\nIn fact, it is time to recognise that external rule in Bosnia has failed. The Dayton agreement in 1995 set up an undemocratic “protectorate”, giving the high representative of the western powers neocolonial authority over a political system that has institutionalised ethnic divisions, while neoliberal economic policies have impoverished ordinary Bosnians regardless of ethnicity.\n\nDo the western powers have any answers to this crisis? The high representative, Valentin Inzko, can think only of threatening military intervention. Periodic threats by the US and the EU to revise the Dayton agreement by recentralising Bosnia have only made matters worse, raising the spectre of secession as Serbs and Croats look to Serbia and Croatia for support. And neither Brussels nor Washington will contemplate reversing the neoliberal economic policies that have impoverished so many.\n\nIt is therefore time to terminate the office of the high representative and end outside meddling in Bosnian affairs.\n\nThe popular protests have made clear that there is widespread rejection of ethnic divisions and neoliberal policies imposed from above. Free from external economic, political and military pressure, we are confident that the peoples of Bosnia will come together to establish a society based on social justice and national equality.\n\nSamir Amin Economist, Senegal\n\nCédric Durand Economist, Paris 13 University, France\n\nEmin Eminagić Activist, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nLindsey German Stop the War Coalition (p/c), United Kingdom\n\nGrigoris Gerotziafas Associate professor of hematology-hemostasis, Université Pierre et Maris Curis (Paris VI), militant of Antarsya in France/Greece\n\nAnna Grodzka Member of parliament of the Republic of Poland\n\nCostas Isihos Member of the political secretariat and head of the foreign policy department of Syriza\n\nMariya Ivancheva Independent scholar and member of the editorial board of LeftEast, Bulgaria\n\nStathis Kouvelakis Reader in political theory, King’s College, London, and Syriza central committee, United Kingdom and Greece\n\nZbigniew Marcin Kowalewski Researcher and editor, Poland\n\nAleksandra Lakić Researcher, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nKen Loach Film director, United Kingdom\n\nJames Meadway Economist, United Kingdom\n\nMatija Medenica Solidarnost editor, Serbia\n\nChina Miéville Author, United Kingdom\n\nTijana Morača Independent researcher, Serbia\n\nGoran Musić Historian, Austria\n\nJelena Petrović Red Min(e)d, Slovenia\n\nDragan Plavšić Lawyer and author, United Kingdom\n\nFlorin Poenaru Anthropologist, Romania\n\nSrećko Pulig Aktiv editor, Croatia\n\nMarija Ratković The Culture of Memory, Serbia\n\nJames Robertson Graduate student, history, New York University, United States\n\nCatherine Samary Economist, France\n\nRichard Seymour Author and columnist, United Kingdom\n\nGM Tamás Philosopher, CEU, Budapest, Hungary\n\nMary Taylor CUNY Graduate Center, USA\n\nVladimir Unkovski-Korica Historian, United Kingdom\n\nAna Vilenica Uz)bu))na))) editor, Serbia\n\nAndreja Živković Author, United Kingdom\n\nHaving worked in Ukraine over some years, including one when inflation was 11,000%, when the west and international financial agencies imposed “shock therapy” after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the hypocrisy in the posturing of various outsiders today is chilling. Of course, we should all want non-intervention by Vladimir Putin. But we should recall interventions by those demanding that Russia now desist (Kiev on war footing as Putin’s grip tightens, 3 March).\n\nOne aspect of the unfolding tragedy may be minor in itself but signifies a malaise creeping through democratic discourse. It reflects the commodification of politics, led by the United States.\n\nIn Ukraine’s last presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych was languishing in the polls with 4% support. Then an oligarch put money together and hired the services of the US Republican party’s leading strategists. They descended on Kiev, repackaged the candidate, stopped him from revealing his character, incoherence and ignorance, and obliged him to adopt words they wanted him to use. Within weeks he was leading the polls.\n\nMeanwhile, his principal rival, also with a murky past, hired Barack Obama’s electoral outfit, at vast cost. As it turned out, Bush’s men won the surrogate election.\n\nNobody could pretend they did not know Yanukovych was a twice-convicted gangster. But the Americans and others greeted his election as a triumph of democracy. Sadly, this newspaper endorsed that view in a leader.\n\nDavid Cameron hires an Australian rottweiler to repackage the Tories for the next election. Ed Miliband responds by recruiting an American with a track record on the right. This is not in the same league as in Ukraine, but signifies a rottenness in mainstream politics. We need a countervailing strategy.\n\nProfessor Guy Standing\n\nSOAS, University of London\n\n• John Kerry accuses the Russians of acting “in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped-up pretext”.

It makes the hand-wringing of David Cameron and William Hague all the more nauseating.\n\nMr Putin is defending the Russian majority, settled in Crimea centuries ago by Catherine the Great, who feel threatened by rightwing elements in Ukraine who have passed a law denigrating the use of the Russian language, and threatening their Orthodox religion.\n\nWhich country was it that settled Protestants in Ireland, to form an artificial majority in one specific area, then spent the best part of a century defending that “majority” against the perceived threat of Catholic domination? Black and Tans? RUC? Collusion with the UDF? Boots on the ground? Motes and beams come to mind.\n\nJane Ghosh\n\nBristol\n\n• I think it is a terrific idea to commemorate the first world war by having it again without the horses.\n\nJane Coles\n\nTwickenham, Middlesex\n\nIndependent:\n\nI was born in Kiev, Ukraine and spend 22 years of my life there. As all my family and friends are Russian speakers, Ukrainian always felt rather like a foreign language that I knew well but hardly used in everyday life. But wherever I went, including the Ukrainian-speaking west, I never felt any pressure to switch to Ukrainian.\n\nAround the country there are enough Russian schools, press and books, TV and radio channels available; many Ukrainian web pages come in two languages. Speeches by Russian politicians about discrimination against the Russian population in Ukraine leave me baffled.\n\nUkraine is not divided; it is being divided. The main issue that creates tensions between the regions is a massive information campaign aimed at the Russian-speaking regions.\n\nMany people in the east and south rely on the Russian press. Without access to internet and geographically far from the capital, people don’t find it hard to believe the “news” about nationalists seizing power with the aim of killing or exiling all the Russian-speaking population. I tried to watch Russian news to get an alternative opinion but I lost my patience after a report showing “thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Ukraine for Russia”. It showed a checkpoint near the border with Poland.\n\nThe real news is much more scary and absurd: Russian soldiers surrounding the Ukrainian military base in Crimea; Russian politicians handing new Russian passports to the Ukrainian militants from the special forces accused in fatal injuries of civilians during the demonstrations in February.\n\nThe world needs to act quickly.\n\nJulia Fedorenko, London W1\n\nHere we go again. Russia acts to protect its vital interests – and no one can be in doubt about the importance of Crimea to its security – and the West comes out with threats and bluster. The obvious way out is for the areas of Ukraine which appear to have a majority for closer relations with Russia to break away.\n\nCzechoslovakia broke up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia without any of the dire consequences envisaged by the Western powers in the case of Ukraine. But then, the Czechs are perhaps the only sensible electorate in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn a few months’ time, Scotland is going to decide its future, again without earth-shattering consequences. So the Nato countries should tell Kiev to get on and let their local populations decide their own future. The Ukraine crisis is not worth starting another cold war which could so easily change into a hot war.\n\nLyn Brooks, Ongar, Essex\n\nWithin hours of the Winter Olympics ending, the host nation seemed to be willing to start an international crisis.
