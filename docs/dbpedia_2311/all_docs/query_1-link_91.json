The twenty-nine chapters in this two-volume history provide an authoritative chronological survey of the Irish literary tradition. Spanning fifteen centuries of literary achievement, the two volumes range from the earliest Hiberno-Latin texts to the literature of the late twentieth century. The contributors, drawn from a range of Irish, British and North American universities, are internationally renowned experts in their fields. The Cambridge History of Irish Literature comprises an unprecedented synthesis of research and information, a detailed narrative of one of the world’s richest literary traditions, and innovative and challenging new readings. No critical work of this scale and authority has been attempted for Irish literature before. Featuring a detailed chronology and guides to further reading for each chapter, this magisterial project will remain the key reference book for literature in Ireland for generations to come. This second volume covers the long twentieth century, a period marked by the achievements of Irish writers in all genres, and looks forward to developments in the new millennium. margaret kelleher is Senior Lecturer in the Department of English at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.

Putnam asked Moses Coit Tyler to produce a ‘manual’ of American literature. Tyler was to do much more than that. Convinced that it was now time to write an account of what he called ‘the most confidential and explicit record’ of the American mind, the record preserved in the nation’s literature, he undertook a full-scale history of American literature from 1607 to 1765, a pioneering effort that was to mark the beginning of the serious study of that literature. Tyler himself was in 1881 to join the faculty of Cornell University as the holder of the first professorship in the United States devoted to American history. We believe that now is the time for a similar pioneering effort to create a coherent and authoritative history of Irish literature in the two major languages of the island. The publication in 1991 of the three-volume Field Day Anthology of IrishWriting, the first attempt to formulate a standard if not definitive anthology of Irish literature, has in effect established a canon of Irish literature, a canon since expanded with the appearance in 2002 of the fourth and fifth volumes of the anthology, volumes dedicated to writing by and about women. The existence of such a canon, however contested, only makes more compelling – even urgent – the need for an accessible and reliable historical framework within which the newly canonical texts can be read, and marginalised texts, together with the reasons for their marginalisation, can be explored. Indeed the Field Day Anthology has created the anomalous situation in which Ireland now has a chronologically organised literary canon but no comprehensive literary history in light of which to think about it. Of course that does not mean that there are not sound works of Irish literary history available. Unlike Tyler, we face a situation in which there is an almost baffling profusion of histories, biographies, critical monographs, and so on, dealing with various aspects of the literatures of Ireland. Yet for all this wealth of scholarly material, we have as yet no definitive literary history. To be sure, 1\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nmargaret kelleher and philip o’leary\n\nthere are important and useful surveys like those by Jeffares and Deane for Irish writing in English, and for Irish writing in Irish by Hyde, de Blacam and J. E. Caerwyn Williams (the last translated into Irish and English from the original Welsh). In addition, there are, of course, histories of individual periods, movements, genres, themes, etc. But for the scholar or general reader trying to make sense of the bigger picture, looking for a reliable overview of the Irish literary tradition as it has developed in both Irish and English, there has been next to nothing. Given the enormous scholarly and popular interest in Irish literature at present, now is the time to remedy this deficiency. Ireland’s literary tradition spans more than fifteen hundred years. As we begin the new millennium, we have both a need and an opportunity to make sense of that long tradition by providing an authoritative chronological history that will enable readers to check facts on specific authors and literary works, to trace in meaningful detail stylistic and thematic developments and influences through time, or to explore the often neglected interrelationships between the two literary traditions that have shared the island over the past five hundred years. For as Homi Bhabha has pointed out in The Location of Culture, ‘what is theoretically innovative, and politically crucial, is the need to think beyond narratives of originary and initial subjectivity and to focus on those moments or processes that are produced in the articulation of cultural differences’.1 At the moment, Irish culture is experiencing unprecedented visibility and acclaim on the world stage. Simultaneously, Irish Studies has developed as a respectable academic discipline in many universities, most notably in North America and Great Britain, but also in Australia, continental Europe and, curiously belatedly, in Ireland itself. Yet despite this visibility, not all those engaged with Irish culture share the confidence, even occasional complacency, that is the predictable by-product of such striking accomplishments. In fact, some have experienced a nagging ambivalence, a concern that superficial successes, however impressive, are actually obscuring rather than illuminating an authentic understanding of crucial questions called forth by those very successes. Are Irish writers in English the Anglophone flavourof-the-moment for jaded cosmopolitan readers? Is translation a vital transfusion of cross-cultural energy that will make writing in Irish more visible and ultimately more viable, or is it a lethal injection leading to linguistic redundancy? Do the plays of Martin McDonagh give new voice to the ever-evolving vitality of Irish theatre, or do they cynically parasitise that tradition to propagate a (not all that) new species of stage Irishism? What does the controversy over the Field Day Anthology say about the 2 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nIntroduction\n\npossibility of thinking about Irish writing as a distinct and coherent literary entity? It is, however, difficult, if not impossible, to think clearly and creatively, much less authoritatively, about these and other questions, large and small, without a specifically Irish context in which to read the literary works all too often seen as curious offshoots from a normative English tradition. At present, scholars and general readers alike lack such a context, with even those professionally involved in the study of Irish culture often experiencing an insecurity about finding a proper approach to thinking about Irish literature, about whether and how current developments relate to an ongoing tradition, and indeed about the existence and nature of that tradition itself. Given that those previous histories that do exist have concentrated exclusively on one or the other of Ireland’s two major literary traditions, we see The Cambridge History of Irish Literature as a pioneering as well as a timely project. Far more than simply supplementing existing and forthcoming histories of English literature, it provides the first systematic and comprehensive overview of the Irish literary tradition as it has achieved expression over the centuries in both Irish and English. The adherence to a chronological structure of organisation for the history means that the earlier chapters focus almost exclusively on Irish-language texts and writings in insular Latin and Norman French. Later chapters alternate between the Irish and English language traditions, with literature in English playing a considerably – and appropriately – more prominent, though never exclusive, role from the seventeenth century on. Our approach should, by its very novelty, generate new comparative insights, particularly in areas such as oral tradition, antiquarianism, translation or bilingualism, where the two languages have been, and still are, in direct and fruitful contact. For general readers and even teachers and students, many of whom know only of an Irish literature in English, the relevant chapters provide a thorough and authoritative discussion of both familiar and less well-known texts along with an analysis of historical trends and current developments in the different periods. At the same time, readers of the History will also be introduced, many for the first time, to the diversity of the Irish-language tradition, a tradition many may have only encountered previously at second-hand through the uses and misuses to which it has been subjected by Irish writers of English. The older Irish-language material will thus not only be of interest to those with a special interest in the Gaelic past or to medievalists and scholars of comparative literature seeking access to seminal texts previously denied them. It should also enable those primarily interested in Irish literature in English to see how that literature has been influenced right up to the present by the older native 3 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nmargaret kelleher and philip o’leary\n\ntradition. We do not, then, see this as two discrete histories sharing the same covers, but rather as an integrated narrative addressing the needs of a wide readership from many different backgrounds. On the other hand, we have not tried to construct a unitary or teleological ‘metanarrative’ from the rich and often refractory reality of Irish literature. Rather, our intention is to offer a comprehensive and accessible survey of two thousand years of Irish literature in two principal and several incidental languages. One controversy that the editors have had to face from the title page itself concerns the complex and often contested definitions of what an ‘Irish’ writer is. Our primary criterion for inclusion has been that authors were born on the island of Ireland or lived a significant and formative period of their lives there. Thus we include writings by Spenser, Moryson, Davies, Swift, Sterne, Goldsmith, Trollope and many others as important contributions to the history of Irish literature. In the case of representations of Ireland by English and other commentators (Carlyle, Engels, Gaskell, Asenath Nicholson, etc.), we are interested in the shaping role acquired by such representations, in particular their influence in Ireland and the response they generated from Irish authors. Obviously this definition by its very flexibility generates its own ambiguities. In cases of genuine uncertainty as to whether writers should be considered ‘Irish’ in any meaningful sense, we would prefer to err on the side of generous inclusion rather than to impose any kind of ethnic or ideological litmus test. Indeed, in some ways the very fact that an author’s ‘Irishness’ is an issue worthy of debate is itself proof that he or she belongs in the History! By defining Irishness on an inclusive island-wide basis, we are also asking our contributors to be sensitive to the existence of differing cultural, political and literary traditions on the island. By no means should this be seen as a genuflection to a transient political correctness. Given the rapid changes affecting Ireland today, in particular the still-embryonic growth of a newly multi-cultural society as a result of increasing immigration, this question of creating and living with a more fluid and embracing sense of Irish identity may well be the most important new theme in Irish literature confronting the editors of the successor to these volumes in the future. For now, however, we are attempting to subvert more familiar dichotomies. Thus, for example, we do not intend to marginalise writing from the unionist tradition in Northern Ireland by relegating it to a separate chapter as a regional or provincial offshoot of a putative dominant national tradition. In keeping with the practice adopted in other Cambridge History volumes, we use the term ‘literature’ in an expansive sense, not limited to belles lettres, but also encompassing where appropriate a wide range of other forms of literary 4 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nIntroduction\n\nexpression. We are not seeking to denigrate or subvert the term ‘literature’, finding it instead both a useful and a necessary term. The traditional genres of poetry, prose and drama are, as is proper, at the heart of this project. Yet by adopting a more comprehensive working definition of what constitutes literature, we make room for several forms of literary expression that have been more prominent in Irish literature than in that of other predominantly Anglophone countries. Could any comprehensive history of Irish literature fail to engage with autobiographical writings such as those by Wolfe Tone, Yeats, George Moore or Sean O’Casey in English, or the so-called ‘Blasket autobiographies’ in Irish, a genre memorably parodied by ‘Myles na gCopaleen’ in An B´eal Bocht (The Poor Mouth)? In like manner, any discussion of Irish literature in either of the island’s languages would be poorer for the absence of the many adaptations and reworkings of early Irish heroic tales by authors such as Standish James O’Grady, Lady Gregory, Thomas Kinsella and Seamus Heaney. And of course such adaptations provide a particularly rich illustration of an ongoing cross-fertilisation between the two traditions. Another example of an ongoing Irish cultivation of less traditional genres is the popularity of political writing from Swift and Burke, to the Young Ireland writers of The Nation newspaper in the mid-nineteenth century, to the contemporary social and cultural critics associated with Field Day and the Raven Arts Press. We have asked contributors to address the question of generic ambiguity as a persistent and positive quality of Irish literature in both Irish and English. We hope to show that the Irish tendency to challenge, subvert, redefine and/or merge traditional genres is one of the major forces that gives Irish literature its distinctiveness and vitality, and by no means an indication that Irish writers have either failed to master the canonical genres or devoted an inordinate effort to the cultivation of miniaturist adaptations of major genres from the dominant English tradition. In fact, Irish experimentation with genre goes back to the very origins of Irish literature, to the often anti-climactic heroic tales that represent the oldest vernacular literature north of the Alps and that, despite the example of classical models of the epic, are almost entirely in prose. In this light, one could see Swift’s satires, Wilde’s subversions of the well-made play, Synge’s violent comedies, Yeats’s experiments with the Noh drama, O’Casey’s blendings of high tragedy and farce, and the stylistic experiments of Joyce, Beckett and Flann O’Brien as only a few of the most conspicuous examples in a mainstream Irish tradition of revisioning and revising conventional genres. The part played by literary works in the broader cultural sphere in Ireland, and their relation to the history and politics of their time, is of necessity an essential theme throughout. Chapter titles are used to help place the literary 5 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nmargaret kelleher and philip o’leary\n\ntexts under discussion into a recognisable historical context. A fundamental theme of this History is the role of literature in the formation of Irish identities. (And again it should be noted here that we are not positing any unitary or essentialist definition of what it means to be Irish.) Of particular interest throughout the History is how literature has been shaped by and in turn has helped shape the political and social developments of its time. Literature in Ireland has often provided a forum in which issues suppressed or neglected in the political arena can continue to circulate. On the other hand, literature has also been the subject of state control and censorship under both colonial and native governments. One of the more fruitful contributions of the History is its exploration of these themes through history, showing, for example, how intricately contemporary political issues were woven through the early literature in Irish, how the works of writers as diverse as Swift, Goldsmith, Wilde and Shaw take on different resonances when read in a specifically Irish context, and how Free State censorship blended moral and political objections to suppress dissident voices in the first decades of native rule in the South. By no means do we read the interplay between literature and politics as straightforward and unambiguous. Rather, we hope to explore how this interplay has generated its own traditions in Irish writing – past and present, in Irish and in English, North and South – traditions shaped by diverse, complex and shifting impulses which somehow manage to co-exist, however uneasily and at times all but invisibly. The contents of this history span work from the sixth century to the year 2000, interweaving literature in Irish and English. Using this scheme readers should be empowered, in a way that was never possible while the two linguistic traditions were treated in isolation, to note and trace the existence of parallel or contradictory trends in the literary development of two languages sharing a single small landmass. Needless to say, the complexities and discontinuities of Irish life as expressed in two very different languages under the stress of a colonial hegemony seen very differently by different segments of the population often render any simplistic linear narrative inadequate, if not downright misleading. But these gaps and disjunctions are at the very heart of the Irish experience, and can therefore be far more interesting, challenging and suggestive, not only for specialists in Irish literary studies, but also for an international audience. Among the practical consequences of the acknowledgement of such gaps is that chapters do not always flow together seamlessly, a development we see as inevitable and beneficial. The break between volumes occurs just before the commencement of the Literary Revival (c.1890). Volume I ends with a transitional chapter on the reciprocal relationships between oral and literary traditions in Irish and 6 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnglish. This chapter looks back to the nineteenth century (and earlier) and forward to the twentieth century from this dual-language perspective. The opening chapter in volume II is also organised around a crucial theme, in this case the interplay between literature and politics in Ireland. In like manner, the final two chapters of the entire History are intended to continue this thematic focus and indeed extend it into the future. These chapters, one dealing with literature in Irish, the other with literature in English, provide an assessment of the current state of Irish writing as well as a projection of possible future trends, all in light of current critical and theoretical methodologies that have radically changed the way we think about Irish literature at the turn of the new millennium. The allocation of an entire volume to the period 1890–2000 obviously represents a bias. We are aware of this bias, and see it as almost inescapable. Many readers will doubtless consult the History for an understanding of the place and significance of modern and contemporary authors in an evolving tradition. Deprived of the luxury of a critical consensus formed over time, we may well have attributed an importance to writers of the recent past and the present that future historians will find inappropriate. But thus has it always been. We believe our decision to devote so much space to twentieth-century literature is justified both by the extent and quality of that literature and by what we believe will be significant reader interest in it. Moreover, readers drawn to the History primarily by an interest in the recent past may find especially illuminating and empowering the opportunity to explore the traditions and circumstances that shaped twentieth-century Irish literature in both languages. One of the potentially more enlightening and provocative aspects of the History is its commitment to acknowledging the centrality of canonical figures, while also noting and discussing the contributions of less well-known writers, including those in the process of being retrieved from what now seems inexplicable obscurity and those previously marginalised for reasons having nothing to do with literary merit, but instead based on religion, gender or sexual preference. Indeed a recuperative impulse has been a fundamental motive throughout these two volumes. Moses Coit Tyler’s 1875 history was a pioneering effort, although one whose path can no longer be blindly followed, in large part because he was so sure of where that path would lead – to an ever-clearer, uncontested definition of what it meant to be American. The American tradition in literature will be more accurately explored in the pluralist and multivalent New Cambridge History of American Literature (edited by Sacvan Bercovitch) than it ever could be, even in its own time, by the monochromatic and teleologic approach of Tyler. Of 7 Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nmargaret kelleher and philip o’leary\n\ncourse an emphasis on living tradition always looks to the future as well as the past, though the parameters of that future can only be suggested, never defined, much less guaranteed. Nevertheless, as Linda Hutcheon points out in her essay ‘Rethinking the National Model’, the traditional national model of literary history, one that lays down ‘a familiar bedrock of development’ and ‘historically guarantees a sense of cultural legitimacy’, may have to be created ‘before competing, correcting, or even counterdiscursive narratives can be articulated’.2 In this History we have tried both to lay down that ‘familiar bedrock’ and to suggest where ‘competing, correcting, or even counterdiscursive narratives’ might begin to reshape our understanding of the past. A future Cambridge History of Irish Literature will look very different from this one. We hope, however, that its editors will not find their intellectual forebears an embarrassment. Notes 1.

This was but one indication that creative writers are central to the self-image of Ireland. Another might have been found on the national banknotes still circulating in that year. These featured such figures as W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Douglas Hyde and Jonathan Swift, as well as the nineteenth-century political leaders Daniel O’Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell. The number of artists far exceeded the number of political figures, such as were to be found on the currencies of most other European countries. In the modern Republic of Ireland, culture is often seen as healing, whereas history is viewed as divisive. If the last national currency before the arrival of the Euro in 2002 projected writers as part of the self-description of a people, the design of the very first set of coins for the Free State back in the 1920s had been entrusted to a committee chaired by W. B. Yeats. That same author was, even then, putting the final touches to A Vision, his attempt to write a personal imaginative system which might also function as a Celtic constitution for the emerging nation. Nor was there anything immodest about the ease with which Yeats identified his intellectual project with that of the nation. After all, by then James Joyce had presented his first collection of stories, Dubliners, as ‘a chapter of the moral history of my country’ and had ended A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man with the protagonist’s promise to forge in the smithy of his soul ‘the uncreated conscience of my race’.1 Against that backdrop, it may not have been surprising that the question most often put to Seamus Heaney in interviews during the quarter-century leading up to his Nobel Prize was this: what was his solution to the ‘troubles’ of Northern Ireland? A poet was expected to propound an answer to a problem which had defeated the best intelligence of political science for generations. As far back as 1972 Richard\n\n9\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nRose had called Northern Ireland ‘a problem without a solution’.2 In Ireland, however, artists are expected to see things other mortals don’t see and the social powers accorded to the artist are of ancient lineage.\n\nCatastrophism and art: the sense of an ending The fil´ı or poets stood second only to the chieftain in the power-structure of Gaelic Ireland, carrying rods as symbols of their vatic powers. They composed while lying on pallets in darkened huts and their job was to praise a good prince, rebuke his enemies and memorialise dead heroes in immortal lines. After the collapse of the old order in 1600 and the Flight of the Earls in 1607, all that changed: and so the fil´ı became the first ‘dandies’ of Europe, which is to say courtiers dispossessed of a court. Deprived of their aristocratic audiences, the fil´ı had no choice but to aim a reconfigured lyric at the wider public and to submit to the conditions of the marketplace. In other parts of Europe, the tradition of literary patronage would last for many more decades – in Germany for two whole centuries – but in Ireland it was now destroyed. Much of the writing of the Irish Renaissance between 1890 and 1925 is an attempt to reverse this reel and to restore elements of the old Gaelic order. The use of actors by Yeats, Synge and Augusta Gregory at the Abbey Theatre recalls the employment of the reacaire as a formal reciter of lines by the fil´ı, with the audience replicating the old convivial gatherings in the prince’s hall.3 Even a figure as unlikely as James Joyce seems to have been caught up in this project: his Stephen is described in Ulysses as a ‘youthful bard’ complete with vatic cane, just as Joyce himself wished to re-enter what he called ‘the fair courts of life’ (pressing gullible but monied bluestockings into service as replicants of the old princely patrons).4 All of this revivalism was of course wish-fulfillment. After 1607 it was clear to those who had eyes to see that the old days could never return. The serfs had been freed in 1605 and from that moment on could save money, press cases in court or even buy land. They were no longer obliged to provide free field labour to princes but must now be recompensed for all work done. With pastorage giving way to tillage, there was good money to be made and life became easier for many. Soon the former serfs were outbidding fallen noblemen for tracts of land. A centralised administration was being established in Dublin. As primogeniture took the place of custom, the old rule of poets as interpreters of rightful sovereignty was lost. Under the new laws, there was no place for them. Small wonder that these ruined aristocrats floated their poems on the market in a heavily ironical search for a buyer. Over two centuries before Charles 10\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nBaudelaire lamented a similar loss of aura among French poets, now turning ´ tricks like harlots desperate to please a passing customer, Mathghamhain O hIfearn´ain asks: Ceist! cia do cheinneochaidh d´an? a chiall is ceirteolas suadh: an ngeabhadh, n´o an a´ il le haon, d´an saor do-bh´earadh go buan?5 A question! who will buy a poem whose content is the fit learning of scholars? Will anyone accept or does anyone even want a fine poem that will last forever?\n\nThe fil´ı had been futurologists, as that last line wryly implies. As part of their prophetic function, they proclaimed the honour of their chief for the coming generations. It was through the poet’s vibrant lines that a ruler or warrior left ‘names upon the harp’.6 Now there was a sense that that future was annulled: the ruined fil´ı were among the first poets of the world to abandon the comforts of tradition and to seek an originality that was market-oriented. Much of the art produced by the fil´ı between 1600 and 1660 anticipates those elements of Modernism rehearsed in 1840s Paris. The broken dandies tried to appear unperturbed amidst the collapse of old securities but were now lamenting the death of an entire civilisation, while desperately seeking any new patrons who might suddenly emerge from the chaos. Instead of the old duty of keening this or that personage, they were now lamenting the end of culture itself. Yet their dirges were somewhat paradoxical. The need to address a wider audience had a tonic effect upon their art, infusing it with a new vitality of diction and urgency of rhythm.7 These desperadoes took pleasure in stating the worst but with such eloquence as to throw the diagnosis into question. For many, death was just another career move. The old mortuary traditions were thus given a new set of inflections, becoming in effect one of the most potent of all rhetorical devices in the cultural politics of the next 400 years. That rhetoric would inspire the Fenians of the 1860s, who found Ireland like a corpse on the dissecting table and kissed it back to life. It would explain Patrick Pearse’s use of the grave of O’Donovan Rossa to indicate that the patriot dead would ensure that an unfree land could never be at peace. It would stoke the phoenix-fires of more recent republicans and hunger-strikers in Northern Ireland who said ´ ‘Eireoidh muid ar´ıs’ (We shall rise again). If the search for the means to put an end to things, as Samuel Beckett wittily observed, is what enables discourse to continue, then the Irish have known that better than most. For centuries their 11\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nculture has been surviving near-death experiences in a state of augmented vitality. The ruined bards made their verses grow fat on negation. Perhaps it was in their poetic achievement that the notion of ‘the triumph of failure’, which would animate not just the Easter Rising but the aesthetic of Beckett, was so strangely born.\n\nThe nomad as sign of the modern One of the central figures in the texts of Irish Modernism, the tramp or nomad, also has roots in the fall of the bardic order. Both Yeats and Synge saw in the tramp a version of the decline of the Anglo-Irish gentry: and that equation was all the more telling if the tramp were taken as a version of the ruined bard/turned spailp´ın poet, travelling from place to place with song and story. The tramps of Beckett are men who sound as educated as any bard, and as d´eclass´e, rather in the manner of people whose self-image is exalted even as their fate is humble. ‘You should have been a poet,’ says a sardonic Didi to Gogo in Waiting for Godot, only to evoke the reply, as his partner gestures at his rags: ‘I was. . . . Isn’t that obvious?’8 Synge, in particular, saw in these learned nomads early types of the artistic sons of mercantile families and took to signing his own love letters: ‘your old tramp’.9 The degree of identification by twentieth-century authors with the toppled bards of the early seventeenth is remarkable: in both cases the collapse of an order signalled a major revival in literature, which sought to come to terms with all the turbulence. The narrators of Beckett’s texts (‘A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine’)10 often evoke the compositional practices of the fil´ı on their pallets, even as the wanderers of Yeats’s poetry lament the philistinism of middle-class arrivistes in ‘The Curse of Cromwell’. The lesson of the fil´ı wasn’t lost on these authors: by over-identifying with a single political regime, they ran the risk of falling with it. The more intrepid Irish Modernists could see a further analogy: between the ruined bardic poets and the cakesand-ale aristocrats of Shakespeare. Both groups were displaced in due course by Malvolio-style puritans, seeking revenge on the whole cavalier pack.\n\nMeltdown: literary form and social change Whenever one order falls and another eventually takes its place, there is in art a period of ‘latency’ when forms go into meltdown and all kinds of innovation are attempted. In most parts of Europe, the transition from aristocracy to bourgeoisie happened with relative speed, so that the new forms of literature 12\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nthrown up by the changes (notably the form of the novel) soon stabilised into formula. In Ireland, however, conditions were somewhat different. The native aristocracy was toppled after 1600, two or more centuries before equivalent events elsewhere in Europe, but a truly comprehensive native middle class didn’t emerge until well into the twentieth century. Between these dates, the key works of Irish prose were collections of micro-narratives cast in the appearance of a novel but without its sense of a completely connected plotline. Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels is really four short contes and Castle Rackrent describes many generations in sixty pages. Works as varied as Siabhra Mhic na M´ıochomhairle, Ulysses, At Swim-Two-Birds or Cr´e na Cille are structured around episodes and anecdotes which never quite shape themselves into a novel. If epic is the genre of warrior aristocrats and the novel that of the bourgeoisie, then it is in the troubled transition period between these orders that a radical innovation of forms becomes possible. In most lands that transition was managed smoothly, but in Ireland it took more than three centuries. The radical innovations in Irish begin with the writings of Seathr´un C´eitinn ´ hEodhasa. Two centuries before Wordsworth’s ‘Preface’ to and Eochaidh O the second edition of The Lyrical Ballads, they were compelled to address their lines to the masses rather than the classes. They were able to think like wise men, yet express themselves like the common people. Some (such as C´eitinn) who might have been bards now became priests, adding a millennial element to their narratives. Proclaiming themselves at the end of a whole era, they brought a modern sense of crisis to Irish writing. In their eyes (as in the view of the English planter-poet Edmund Spenser), Ireland was a site of apocalypse. If Spenser saw ‘mutabilitie’ as the mark of all created things, and the deaths of rebels as a version of the Last Judgement, so did a priest like C´eitinn. Both men, after all, were courtiers without a court. For the next three centuries, writers would know only dire stress, forever proclaiming themselves at the end of an era. Yet the promised apocalypse never came on cue. Instead, its terrors were absorbed back into art-works, by intellectuals who would learn how to make destitution sumptuous. The less of Ireland there was to write about, the more copious and gorgeous was the documentation about it.\n\nVirtual worlds With the Gaelic lords either fled or on the run, the fil´ı were reduced through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the condition of journeymen or day-labourers. Yet in another sense they were more important than ever, for 13\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nnow they maintained the consciousness of a proud underground people. Their lyrics were promissory notes or blueprints for a restored Gaelic Ireland which might re-emerge at some future time – and thus the prophetic element of the tradition was maintained. The virtual world of the fairies, who were believed to exist beyond the ‘rational’ social order (perhaps even underground in the ‘unconscious’ of the people) became itself a practical zone of alterity, in which it was possible to ‘think otherwise’. If the colonisers had a secret police who spied on rebels and insurgents, as Angela Bourke has shown, the natives had access to fairies who might spy back on the enemy, being (like the police) everywhere and nowhere at once.11 It would be hard to overestimate the social power of the virtual worlds often created by writers within the colonial scheme. For instance, the courts of poetry set up in Munster in the eighteenth century were not only serious attempts to reconnect with bardic tradition but also subversive parodies of the despised English law. In these courts a self-appointed sheriff often signed a pompous ‘warrant’, in a mocking throwback to the ancient days when file and breitheamh were one. In similar style, the court presided over by fairy-women in Brian Merriman’s poem seems another parody of the hated parliamentary processes which had brought such misery to Ireland. The poem was also, however, a return to the old sovereignty myths, as well as a radical prophecy of a future when women might be fully empowered. Texts like these had a palpable influence on the insurgent leaders of Ireland in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The setting-up of a revolutionary D´ail in 1919, with its own republican courts within the overall British structure, may have been suggested by readings of Merriman’s poem, or of texts like it. Nor did that tradition die away with the attainment of independence in 1922. The novelist John McGahern has suggested that within the censorious land of the 1940s many young people created their own pockets of freedom and experiment. McGahern contended that in the summer months after local dances ‘there wasn’t a hay-rick safe for miles around, but the whole place filled with couples going off like alarm-clocks’.12 It was inevitable that there would be two versions of everything in a colony – official and unofficial – but once again what often seemed like contrary realities turned out upon inspection to be alternative versions of the same thing. Opposites had a habit of turning into doubles. For example, the tradition of the ‘wake’ might have seemed to rationalists a deeply superstitious exercise and an excuse for drunkenness. However, it also functioned as a sort of unofficial autopsy, as Maria Edgeworth noted in Castle Rackrent, giving people time to ensure that the person mourned really was dead.13 Likewise, Edgeworth 14\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nremarked on how fairy raths in which valuables were stored by local people were trusted more than banks, whose role they mimicked. What seemed like foolish superstition to the sceptical outsider often had a perfectly rational explanation. If fireside tales were told of a hand reaching out of rough sea to pull unsuspecting oarsmen to their deaths, this was really a practical warning to sailors about a particularly treacherous tract of seawater along the coast.\n\nUnderground codes: the Gaelic samizdat Words were among the most potent weapons of a disarmed people, who resorted to modes of irony, deceit and wordplay as methods of self-protection. Sir John Davies was perhaps the first to notice that coercion made the Irish grow crafty, for, he said, ‘such as are oppressed are ever put to their shifts’.14 In a contested land, poets said one thing while actually meaning another. They praised the beauty of S´ıle N´ı Ghadhra or C´ait N´ı Dhuibhir or Caitl´ın N´ı Uallach´ain, while secretly celebrating the island imagined as a woman. This was a throw-back to a bardic conceit, according to which the chieftain was married to the land, which was itself female, and so (as we have seen) beautiful or barren depending on the quality of his rule. And that concept was in turn intimately connected with the old sovereignty myths, according to which an ugly crone might meet a young man and offer him the lordship of all Ireland, if only he would sleep with her and thus make her young and beautiful again. A strong echo of that tradition was to be found in the aisling poems of Gaelic Ireland in the eighteenth century, which depicted a passive, wan sp´eirbhean (skywoman), whose weakness would only be brought to an end when her true prince emerged from across the sea to save her. The aisling became increasingly formulaic through the period, being often parodied by poets who recognised that there was little or no chance of a foreign deliverer: but the underlying images remained astonishingly vibrant. They were to be reworked by W. B. Yeats and Augusta Gregory in the play Cathleen ni Houlihan (1902), in which an old woman will once again walk like a ravishing young queen if only the young men are willing to die for her. To Constance Markievicz, the socialist leader of 1916, this play was ‘a kind of gospel’, to the young republican P. S. O’Hegarty ‘a sort of sacrament’, but the constitutional nationalist MP Stephen Gwynn was less enamoured. Though conceding that Maud Gonne’s impersonation of the old woman was deeply moving, he was troubled by the long-term implications. Such plays should not be staged, he averred, unless people were willing to go out of the theatre to shoot and be shot at.15 15\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nThere were many who believed that there was a definite link between the play and the Rebellion of 1916. Even in old age, Yeats fretted about this: Did that play of mine send out Certain men the English shot?16\n\nOne nationalist who did his best to break that link was the Celtic scholar and leader of the Irish Volunteers, Eoin Mac N´eill. Just some weeks before the Easter Rising, he told the men under his command during manoeuvres at Rathfarnham that there really was no such person as Cathleen N´ı Houlihan or a poor old woman. There was merely the physical reality of a land that they might all one day fight for.17 That he should have felt such a deep need to counter the poetic tradition suggests just how tenacious a hold it had on the popular imagination of nationalist males. Perhaps the conceit fed the cult of machismo among young men who might otherwise have felt themselves emasculated by the long pre-1914 peace and by the daily humiliations of life in a down-at-heel colonial backwater. There were other, even deeper codes at work in the Gaelic songs and poems of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but they all had one common element: they showed how public events were swamping private lives, to such an extent that the personal and political meanings of a text were often wholly intertwined. This would become a feature of much poetry in twentieth-century Europe, but it had many precedents in Irish. Poets like Stephen Spender who praised Yeats’s ‘Easter 1916’ as a text which was at once love lyric and political statement thought that this was a new combination in English-language poetry – what Spender called the raising of an ‘occasional’ poem to the status of a political lyric.18 Perhaps it was a new moment in English, but such a combination was of ancient lineage in Irish. As far back as the seventeenth century, the Tipperary rebel and Gaelic ´ ´ Riain was beseeching his lover to shelter him from the aristocrat Eamonn O storm, a storm which turned out on inspection to be the superior fire-power of English guns: ‘C´e h´e sin amuigh A bhfuil faobhar ar a ghuth Ag r´eabadh mo dhorais d´unta?’ ´ ‘Mise Eamonn an chnoic At´a b´aite fuar fliuch ´ sh´ıor-shi´ul sl´eibhte is gleannta.’ O ‘A laogh ghil ’s a chuid\n\n16\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nCad a dh´eanfainnse duit Muna gcuirfinn ort beinn dem gh´una? Mar t´a p´udar go tiubh D´a sh´ıor-sh´eideadh riot, ’s go mbeimis araon m´uchta.’19 ‘Who’s out there in the night. His voice sharp with fright, Beating on my locked door?’ ‘I’m Ned of the Hill, Half drowned and chill With walking the mountain and moor.’ ‘My love and delight How can I ease your plight Only shelter you under my gown? For powder and shot Are forever your lot And together we may both go down.’\n\nIn the figure of this toppled aristocrat may be found yet another precursor of the d´eclass´e wanderers of a later age: ‘Is fada mise amuigh F´e shneachta ’s f´e shioc ’S gan d´anacht agam ar e´ inne; Mo sheisreach gan scur Mo bhranar gan chur Is gan iad agam ar aon chor. N´ıl caraid agam Is danaid liom san Do ghlacfadh m´e moch n´a d´eanach; Is go gcaithfidh m´e dul Thar farraige anonn ´ ann nach bhfuil mo ghaolta.’ Os ‘It’s long I am lost In the snow and the frost And none who will give me a hand; My plough-team is gone, And my sowing’s not done, And I’ve small claim enough to the land. It’s a sorrowful end Without even a friend Who will shelter me late or soon;\n\n17\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nAnd so I must flee To the east over sea, Where none of my kindred is gone.’\n\nThese evicted Gaelic leaders often lamented the felling of the woods by the new English overlords and middlemen: Anois t´a an choill d´a ghearradh Triallfaimid thar chaladh ’s a She´ain U´ı Dhuibhir an Ghleanna, T´a t´u gan g´eim. But now the woods are falling; We must go over the water, And John O’Dwyer of the Valley, You have no game.\n\nThe code is never difficult to crack, for the planters were often puritans and killjoys, seen to be at war with the world of nature itself. If for Edmund Burke, as later for W. B. Yeats, a tree with its branches symbolised the slow, patient evolution of a complex society and its institutions, then those who cut down trees and sold them off at sixpence a time were persons with no understanding of tradition or order. The woods as a whole had both a literal and metaphorical meaning. At a practical level, they were places in which rebels on the run from the crown forces might hide away; but in a more symbolic guise they also represented the unconscious, that place of secrecy where instincts were liberated. Anyone who sought to clear them was simply attempting to roll back and control the instinctual, to make way for the daylight world of reason and commerce. No wonder that the lament for the deforestation of Ireland (famously recycled in the Cyclops episode of Joyce’s Ulysses) was linked with so many other losses, as in the song ‘Cill Cais’: Cad a dh´eanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? T´a deire na gcoillte ar l´ar; N´ıl tr´acht ar Chill Cais n´a a teaghlach Is n´ı chluinfear a cling go br´ath. An a´ it u´ d ina gc´ona´ıodh an deigh-bhean Fuair gradam is meidhir thar mn´a, Bh´ıodh iarla´ı ag tarraingt thar toinn ann Is an tAifreann doimhin d´a r´a.20 What shall we do without timber? The last of the woods is down; Kilcash and the house of its glory\n\n18\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nAnd the bell of the house are gone. The spot where that lady waited Who shamed all women for grace, Had earls come sailing to meet her And Mass was said in the place.\n\n´ Rathaille – lie behind These lines – and others from the Gaelic poet Aog´an O Yeats’s reworking of the theme in ‘The Curse of Cromwell’. There the poet makes a telling comparison between boorish bailiffs who dogged the Gaelic writer in the eighteenth century and the philistine councillors who curbed the artist in the Free State of the 1930s: The lovers and the dancers are all beaten into the clay And the tall men and the swordsmen and the horsemen, where are they? And there’s an old beggar, wandering in his pride, His fathers served their fathers before Christ was crucified.21\n\nOverground codes: Anglo-Irish anxieties On the planter’s side, too, there was much scope for metaphor and innuendo. In a land where there were two contested versions of reality, neither side enjoyed complete dominance. The English planters had control by virtue of military power, but they were nervously aware that the native Irish constituted a four-fifths majority of the population. The external confidence proclaimed in the architecture of the big houses erected by planters could not completely conceal an inner anxiety as to just how long their power might go unchallenged – the Anglo-Irish may indeed have been the first ‘provisionals’. Many of the planters assumed over time the airs of an aristocracy but Gaelic poets were quick to point out that most of them were irretrievably middleclass and no true replacement for the toppled Gaelic princes. This ambiguity about their true social identity added to their inner uncertainty – and thus to their exterior swagger. One consequence was that what sometimes looked like a clash between official and unofficial Ireland was often more accurately a contest for hegemony between ‘unofficial’ and ‘unofficialer’. This anxiety can be deduced in the rhetoric of the Penal Laws enacted against Catholics after 1690. The ferocity of the measures and extremism of their language may have been attempts to compensate for their inoperability in those areas which lacked a secure prison or a working police force. For instance, one enactment compelled Catholics to work on church holidays, but any officer who refused to implement this law could be thrown in jail. ‘The 19\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nlaw acknowledges that it is simply one way of looking at life,’ writes Andrew Carpenter, ‘and seems to accept that the other perspective is de facto to remain in existence.’22 Maidens who married Catholics were to be considered dead (as in effect were all Catholics themselves) – though the great majority clearly continued to breathe after the experience. If these measures were to some degree rhetorical, it may not be surprising that such exercises in radical irony were also performed by creative writers. The most famous case is probably A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift, in which the author suggested that all children under the age of six be provided as roasting-meat from Ireland for English tables. With tongue in cheek, Swift insisted that he could not be accused of having a vested interest in the scheme, since he had no children of eligible age and his wife was now past the age of childbearing. However, Gulliver’s Travels is the paradigmatic text with its tale of a rather unimaginative Englishman caught among tiny Lilliputians and gigantic Brobdingnagians. One source was a folk anecdote heard in the townland of Quilca, County Cavan (and one which has persisted down to our own time in Irish), but Swift gave the narrative a truly Anglo-Irish inflection by foregrounding in it the question of perception. Making great play with Gulliver’s pair of spectacles, he showed how readers identify with the big people in each phase of the story but forced them also to consider what the world must be like for those who feel themselves tiny in the face of overweening power. The ever-shifting perspectives allowed by the story might be applied also to Anglo-Irish relations, with Swift seen as offering an early instance of imperial feedback to the metropolitan centre of London (where the book was first published). A similar obsession with ways of seeing is to be found in the philosophical writings of George Berkeley, the Anglican bishop of Cloyne. His mantra – ‘Esse est percipi, To be is to be perceived’ – is but another way of saying that the forms of perception determine the nature of the thing seen and that such forms are fluid, subjective, ever-changing. Being a spiritually hyphenated people, the Anglo-Irish were doomed to seem forever English in Ireland and Irish in England. That outsider status led to a certain coldness and to a sense of aesthetic distance of authors from subjects, as if they were taking an anthropological view rather than a merely cultural one. Again and again from Swift to Beckett, writers ask exactly what kind of a creature man really is. Such coolness of approach was also conducive to laughter, for, as Horace Walpole said, the world is a comedy to the man who thinks and a tragedy to the man who feels.23 The Anglo-Irish were sharp, edgy thinkers, whose art turned often to mockery, satire and the comedy of manners. 20\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nTo live in a state of hyphenation was to experience perpetual insecurity, but that was a state propitious for the production of a rich literature. Because London was the despatch-point for most publications, the books and texts so issued were almost invariably read as comments on British society. So Gulliver’s Travels was taken as a mordant commentary on high politics in the time of Queen Anne and after, or Goldsmith’s ‘The Deserted Village’ was interpreted as a protest against the changes in small-town England. These analyses unnecessarily limited the possible range of interpretations of major works. It is only in recent decades, with the emergence of a cadre of Irishbased scholars, that analysts have rediscovered Irish bearings in the writing of someone like Richard Brinsley Sheridan, a republican sympathiser with the 1798 rebellion as well as a friend of the English royal family. The tradition of Anglo-Irish comedy, in particular, ran from William Congreve, through George Farquhar, down to Oscar Wilde and Bernard Shaw. Because these artists existed at an angle to English society, their accounts of it had for many the interest of familiar but objective commentators. They were like but not too like their English subjects. So Goldsmith, as a Longford man in London, was in a position to imagine how that city might appear to a Chinese visitor in The Citizen of the World. If the criticisms voiced by the Anglo-Irish authors seemed fair, the writers could be accepted as valid and thoughtful commentators: but if they went too close to the bone for comfort, they could be instantly disregarded, on the grounds that the Irish were merely being whimsical and feckless once again. Much of the tradition of British comedy across the centuries has been an experimental laboratory in which the Anglo-Irish tested certain lines of argument, just as back in Ireland the colonial administrators from the same class tried out new policies on their underlings, which might in due course be introduced in Britain too.\n\nSome write to the future One effect of all of these manoeuvres was to make literature even more socially significant than ever, among the Anglo-Irish as well as the Gaels. A novel by Jane Austen was read by young people in the nineteenth century not only for its vivid plot and sparkling dialogue, but also as a sort of etiquette manual. Close study of it might teach an ambitious young man how to speak to a lady of title or how to walk across a crowded ballroom. Literature, in such applications, was believed to carry the blueprint for a civil society which might be made over in its image. 21\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nSuch a utopian element was, if anything, even more present in writing in the Irish language. The aisling was but one form among the ‘poems of the dispossessed’ which kept the hope of a recovered and vibrant Gaelic system alive. An oppressed people could not identify themselves with most of the great state formations, whether law, army or police: but literature was one social institution through which they might project past values and future aspirations. The act of writing or reading or reciting a Gaelic work meant that, for the duration of its enunciation at least, the artist or receiver was in a world elsewhere, a virtual space, in which all injustices might yet be set to rights. The fil´ı, despite their identification with a toppled aristocracy, became for many persons of humbler origin through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the figures who maintained an underground consciousness. For these people, also, literature was supremely important because it offered a utopian vision based on a visionary understanding of tradition. The pressures of expectation placed in consequence upon all forms of writing in Ireland help to explain their extraordinary involutions of form and style. They may also account for that strange blend of the conservative and the radical which would lead Terry Eagleton to dub Irish Modernism a case of the ‘archaic avant-garde’.24 That blending, however, had occurred well before the twentieth century, for the colonial conditions saw to that. Whether they wished it or not, the Gaelic poets who yearned for a return of the old leaders were by that very volition seen as subversive of the new regime. Hence that strange mixture of nostalgia and radical protest which may be found in texts like C´uirt an Mhe´an O´ıche or Caoineadh Airt U´ı Laoghaire, a conjunction also apparent in ‘The Deserted Village’ by Goldsmith. The upholders of ancient Gaelic value often felt obliged to find new forms – such as ‘Tr´ı Rainn agus Amhr´an’(Three Stanzas and a Song) – in which to address the Irish-speaking masses, so that their old ideas would have the protection of up-to-date metres. This tradition of securing a hearing for aristocratic ideology under the protective cover of a radical form would also link a writer like Swift to a much later example such as W. B. Yeats. But there was a fairly predictable corollary: republicans like Richard Brinsley Sheridan or socialists such as Sean O’Casey would find it equally opportune to use tried dramatic formulae to promote their left-wing social philosophy. In this context, there were some amazing texts in Irish which seemed to have things every way. Merriman’s C´uirt, as we have seen, rigged itself out in an ancient sovereignty myth, but only to promote libertarian modern ideas about the need to fulfil all bodily instincts. What emerged in the end from all these manoeuvres was a sense of the writer, whether in Irish or in English, as a masked rebel, playing off form against 22\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\ncontent for some ulterior purpose, a Tory Radical or a Radical Tory. In this, as in so much else, the two language traditions, in superficial ways so opposed, were often in the deeper structures of thought and feeling much closer than their practitioners seemed to realise.25 Which is to say that the Irish evolved some techniques of literary Modernism decades before its appearance in other parts of the world – and some decades at least before the process of social modernisation began in the 1830s. That decade saw not only the mapping of the countryside by the Ordnance Survey but also the launch of a statewide system of primary schooling (both subjects to be treated with great understanding by Brian Friel in his play Translations). In the 1840s a state postal service was instituted and, like the school system, it was a pilot scheme, well ahead of similar measures in England. Local AngloIrish landlords had proven in many cases delinquent, unlike their counterparts in England, and so the move to centralise power in the state was made sooner in Ireland, leading to a whole set of ‘national’ narratives, often from women writers like Maria Edgeworth or Lady Morgan (Sydney Owenson). Because Ireland was a laboratory, many modern experiments were tried there first – some bad (coercion, cat-and-mouse acts) but others good (some so good that they have yet to be fully implemented in Britain, such as the disestablishment of the Anglican Church as state religion in 1869 or the widespread expropriation of the landlords in the 1880s and after). Yet, for all these innovations, Ireland remained in the nineteenth century, as in the age of Swift, overtaxed and under-capitalised. Here was another case, now in the socio-economic realm, of cultural modernisation existing side by side with material backwardness. It was out of such discrepancies that the art of Irish Modernism at the end of the nineteenth century would emerge. A youth like James Joyce was at once the beneficiary of an impressive system of education and the victim of an economy which had little use for graduates such as he. If you educate a populace to high levels but leave them with few outlets for their talents and qualifications, you are creating the conditions for three things – endemic emigration, cultural efflorescence (as the powerless seize control of discourse, as only the unarmed can) and, eventually, rebellion.\n\nWriting as exile: exile as writing Joyce once had Stephen Dedalus say that the shortest way to Tara, epicentre of Gaelic Ireland, was through Holyhead,26 port of disembarkation for Irish emigrants to Britain. More than a predictable witticism about the difficulty of reviving cultural traditions, this was also a recognition that Irish people 23\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\ndiscover themselves as such only in some foreign country. Given that no people can ever fully define itself from within, exile has indeed been the cradle of nationality. This has interesting implications. Irishness is like Jewishness – whatever people say it is. To be Irish in such a context is simply to be called Irish; and to know what that means, you generally have to ask the English or, failing them, the Americans. Though berated sometimes for their simplemindedness, emigrants in the nineteenth century, such as Oscar Wilde, were aware of the hybrid sources of nationalism: only through contact with the art of another country or countries, said Wilde, could a modern Irish literature be shaped. Some writers went overseas to achieve that distance which allowed them to recast earlier experiences with the same sort of detachment achieved by the Anglo-Irish on the island. Whether the culprit was British rule, censorship by clergy, or the common middle-class distrust of art, they felt (in the words of Frank O’Connor) that ‘an Irish person’s private life begins in Holyhead’.27 Bohemia, a place filled by definition with exiles, rather than Ireland was these artists’ native country. It was the ‘note of banishment’28 which Joyce detected in Shakespeare, whose whole canon he read as a narrative of exile and loss. This was Joyce’s way of converting Shakespeare and his own self into versions of Colmcille: for the story of the saint’s exile and eventual surreptitious return became a paradigm of Irish culture, to be repeated in every generation. Thus the Jail Journal, written by the patriot John Mitchel during his transportation to Tasmania in the 1850s, would become a defining document of modern Irish nationhood. Those who stayed at home were, nonetheless, transformed by this migrant experience too – and for a simple enough reason. Those who left solved two problems. By moving on, they often secured greater comfort for themselves but also made life better for those who stayed, since if they had remained, many would have been a drain on finite resources. If the one in two who left since 1841 had stayed, Ireland would today look more like an underdeveloped country and the United States or Australia seem a lot less prosperous. Wherever emigrants went they took with them something which the stay-at-homes seldom bothered to shoulder: an idea of Ireland. Yet the usual paradox of the exile’s life was to be noted: in England, Australia or North America, those who had emigrated because of a refusal or inability to conform to norms of Irishness at home were, nevertheless, expected to represent precisely that type they had not managed to be. Further simplifications occurred. Aware of the image of the stage Paddy, migrants in England played up to the role, in order to know themselves, assuming an identity in order to prove it on their pulses. 24\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nAs early as 1818, the poet John Keats observed that ‘the Irish are sensible of the character they hold in England and act accordingly to Englishmen’.29 They worked the stereotype, if only because it made an initial relationship possible. Modifications and subtleties could come later. Many found it easier to don the mask of a Paddy than to reshape a complex urban identity of their own. For them once again, Wilde spoke when he quipped: ‘Mask and it shall be given to you’.30\n\nBringing it all back home In such a fashion was a modern culture reshaped out of the hybrid experience of the Irish among nationalities in England, Australia or North America, the double-exposure working, in the words of Benedict Anderson ‘like a whiteon-black photographic negative’.31 The longing for a sod of Sligo earth felt in a London street by the young W. B. Yeats was one manifestation of the phenomenon: and Australian ballads about Ned Kelly were another. All fed the forces of an emergent modern nationalism. By the close of the nineteenth century, a group of activists decided to return and print a photograph of the negative exposure ‘in the dark-room of political struggle’. The centre of gravity in Irish culture was to be shifted from London and New York back to Dublin, as writers would look henceforth for publication in their own land first of all. In the words of Yeats: All day I’d looked in the face What I had hoped ’twould be To write for my own race . . .32\n\nHe believed that the creation of a national literature necessitated the gathering of a national audience. That audience didn’t always welcome the art so offered. When Synge’s ThePlayboyoftheWesternWorld was rejected in 1907, Yeats bleakly observed that whenever a country produces a man of genius, he is never like the country’s idea of itself. He began to suspect that the artist is often an internal exile. For many artists, the act of writing was not only a measure of their estrangement from official versions of Ireland, but also of the removal of that Ireland from its own past. Unlike other emigrants from Europe, the Irish chose to learn English and abandon their native language in their own land. The result was that kind of compulsory Bohemia described in a letter from Friedrich Engels to Karl Marx: ‘the fellows begin to feel like strangers in their own country’.33 Learning English was a desperate bargain made with modernity: it prepared 25\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nchildren for emigration, commercial life or higher education. The famines of the 1840s hit Irish-speaking areas very hard, destroying many Victorian ideas of history as a straight line based on progress and reintroducing the notion of history as an ever-retraced circle – a model which would have huge influence on Yeats in A Vision and on Joyce in Finnegans Wake. By a brutal paradox, English became the language in which the nationalist case was put. If Benedict Anderson is right in saying that print-language creates a nationalism, and not a particular language of itself,34 then English was the ideal medium through which the abstract bonding of people into a unified movement could be achieved. Through newspapers, ballad-sheets, handbills and pamphlets, the very technology which underpinned nationalism was available in the English rather than the Irish language. For a rebel who wished to write a threatening letter to a landlord or defend himself in court, a knowledge of English was essential. Even a fluent Irish speaker such as Daniel O’Connell used English in addressing large crowds for much the same reasons that Arab protestors hold up placards to CNN cameras in English, in the hope that their sentiments would prick the conscience of hesitant liberal well-wishers in the imperial centre. Yet acceptance of English as the major medium of Irish nationalism seemed to undermine the very basis of the separatist claim, leaving the Irish Question to be treated as more economic than political in nature. In part to combat such simplified interpretations, Douglas Hyde and others founded the Gaelic League in 1893.\n\nA masked modernity? It was as if the people had moved too far too fast in cultural terms. To give up a language and learn another would perforce become one of the defining features of modern life for many peoples in the twentieth century, but for hundreds of thousands of Irish this happened in the nineteenth century. To have begun life in a windswept village on the western seaboard and to have ended it in Hammersmith or Hell’s Kitchen was to have experienced the deracination that would be for many millions the central ‘progress’ of the twentieth century. Not necessarily sympathetic to the modern by temperament, the Irish were among the first to be caught in a modern predicament. If at times they evinced a nostalgia for a ‘lost’ Gaelic past, they did so as the natural human response to being hurtled into the future at break-neck speed. Those who suffer from motion-sickness may take some comfort in the rear-view mirror. 26\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\nLiterature and politics\n\nFor such a people modernisation has been not so much an option as a donn´e. The sense of being asked to improvise a set of values in a terrifyingly decontextualised space is the subtext of John Montague’s lines about the loss of Irish in his native Tyrone of the nineteenth century: All around us shards of a lost tradition, The whole countryside a manuscript We had lost the skill to read, A part of our past disinherited But fumbled like a blind man Along the fingertips of instinct.35\n\nA similar crisis underlies the plight of Beckett’s tramps, who must invent on an open stage a set of instant traditions: ‘Yesterday. . . . In my opinion. . . . I was here. . . . yesterday’.36 These tramps also have to imagine the missing details of a landscape, details filled with hints as to how they might behave, when what actually confronts them is a blasted, near-empty setting. Their condition is rather like that of the fil´ı after 1600. This culture is never more modernising in practical purpose than when it appears most nostalgic in its official self-description. The Easter Rebellion of 1916 is the central example, now lamented by fashionable historians as a foolish military misadventure, conducted as an attempt by sentimentalists in open revolt against the modern world to return to a Gaelic order. Nothing could have been more romantic than the symbolic choice of Easter and springtime for a resurrected and revivified land, yet the date also made pragmatic sense too, since Easter Monday was a public holiday, leaving the authorities vulnerable, as police and soldiery spent the day at the horse-races. A similar mingling of the idealistic and the practical may be found in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic by the rebels. It began ‘Irishmen and Irishwomen’, including women in the body politic at a time when they still hadn’t the vote but when suffragism was at its height. Over fifty women fought as volunteer soldiers in the Rising. Another woman, Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, was appointed to the inner cabinet of five ministers, should the provisional government come into administrative being. She would in fact have been the first female government minister anywhere in the world (a full year before Alexandra Kollontai in the Soviet Union). Yet the opening sentence of the Proclamation, in which Ireland was imagined as a woman summoning her children to her flag, was as old as the Gaelic poetic tradition. So the ambivalences persisted. The Rising was home-grown but unthinkable without the help of ‘gallant allies overseas’, not to mention the example of other republics such as France and the United 27\n\nCambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008\n\ndeclan kiberd\n\nStates, nor indeed the ‘dulce et decorum’ rhetoric of World War I. Like much else in the country, it too was an effect of the emigrant experience. The rebel leader Patrick Pearse might summon the Celtic hero Cuchulain to his side, but only to validate his idea of a social-demo"
