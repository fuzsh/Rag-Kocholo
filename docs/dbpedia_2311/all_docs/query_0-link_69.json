        "text": "Dease History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe chronicles of the Dease family reach back into Scottish history to an ancient tribe known as the Picts. The ancestors of the Dease family lived in Angus (in the modern region of Tayside), and claim descent from Gaelic MacDhai, son of David. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Dease family\n\nThe surname Dease was first found in Angus (Gaelic: Aonghas), part of the Tayside region of northeastern Scotland, and present day Council Area of Angus, formerly known as Forfar or Forfarshire, where they were descended from the Gaelic MacDhai, son of David. From the 13th century onward the name was anglicized MacDavid, Davidson, Deasson and Deas. The branches using Deas and Deasson settled in Angus and in Banffshire at the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n\"James Dais is recorded in Dundee, 1611, and Mr. John Daes in Huntliewood, 1638. James Daes was minister of the church of Ersiltoune, 1643. Andrew Daes, stabler, appears in Edinburgh, 1627, and David Daes, tailor there, 1666.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Dease family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Dease research. Another 72 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1611, 1627, 1638, 1677, 1683 and 1804 are included under the topic Early Dease History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nDease Spelling Variations\n\nWhen the first dictionaries were invented in the last few hundred years, spelling gradually became standardized. Before that time, scribes spelled according to sound. Names were often recorded under different spelling variations every time they were written. Dease has been written Deas, Dease, Deasey, Deasy, Dais, Daes, Deasson, Deason, Dasone and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Dease family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Dease Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Dease family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Dease family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 30 words (2 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nDease migration to the United States +\n\nThe crossing to North America did not seem so great in comparison with the hardships many Scots endured at home. It was long, expensive, and cramped, but also rewarding. North America offered land and the chance for settlers to prove themselves in a new place. And many did prove themselves as they fought to forge a new nation in the American War of Independence. The ancestors of those Scots can now experience much of their once-lost heritage through the Clan societies and highland games that have sprung up across North America in the last century. A search of immigration and passenger lists revealed many important, early immigrants to North America bearing the name of Dease:\n\nDease Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nDennis Dease, who settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1855\n\nDennis Dease, who settled in America in 1863\n\nDease Settlers in United States in the 20th Century\n\nWarren Dease, aged 7, who arrived in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1914\n\nRobert Dease, aged 20, who arrived in America, in 1918\n\nThomas Dease, aged 20, who arrived in America, in 1918\n\nAlex Dease, aged 18, who arrived in America, in 1921\n\nAlexander Dease, aged 18, who arrived in America, in 1921\n\nDease migration to Canada +\n\nSome of the first settlers of this family name were:\n\nDease Settlers in Canada in the 18th Century\n\nMr. John Dease U.E.
