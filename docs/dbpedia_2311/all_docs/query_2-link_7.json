Ref.: Z/15. In the Annals of Loreto 1814 – 1860 Mother Teresa Ball has the following entry for August 12 1845: “Right Revd Dr Hughes purchased the best house in Gibraltar for a community from Loretto, Rathfarnham”.\n\n[20] Named after a previous Governor of Gibraltar, General Don.\n\n[21] Annals of Loretto, 1814 – 1860 Written by Mother Teresa Ball: entry for June 22nd, 1851.\n\n6: First Schools\n\n[22]It is interesting to note that in 1930 a large room in the same house was used by the Gibraltar Branch of the British Medical Association.\n\n[23] Mother Christina O’Reilly (who later came to Gibraltar) commenting on the death of Sister Raphael Maguire, the first Sister to die in Bray.\n\n[24] “Our Gibraltar”, D M Ellicott, 1973.\n\n[25] Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Teresa Dease in Canada, 29th November 1851.\n\n[26]Letters of Mother Teresa Ball .\n\n7: Thoughts about Spain\n\n[27] Ibid.\n\n[28] “156 persons were killed at the Siege of Madrid and 18 at the Siege of Saragossa.” Annals of Loretto, entry for July 24th 1856.\n\n29 Cf. Charles Usherwood’s Service Journal, 1852 – 1856. (Kenneth Usherwood, living relative of Charles Usherwood and the Green Howards Regimental Museum, Yorkshire).\n\n[30]Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Eucharia Dease at Loreto Convent, Fermoy, dated “1854”.\n\n[31] When Gardiner was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1848 the Master General of the Ordnance was appalled and referred to him as “a silly vain man”. Hew Strachan: “From Waterloo to Balaclava”, quoted by Tito Benady in Gibraltar Heritage Journal No 6.\n\n[32] Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Alphonsus, 11th August 1860. Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes, grown east of Gibraltar around San Lucar de Barrameda and Manilva, were brought to wine presses in Gibraltar. One was situated in Pitman’s Alley until the late 1800s. Whether Mother Teresa means a poor ‘vintage’ or a poor harvest in general, the result might have meant fewer Spanish boarders from Jerez for the school in Europa which was, of course, the nuns’ main source of income.\n\n8: Mary Ward and Teresa Ball\n\n[33] The Bull of Suppression, “Pastoralis Romani Pontificis” (1630) commands the Christian faithful “to regard and repute them as suppressed, extinct, rooted out, destroyed and abolished”.\n\n[34] Mary Ward’s words quoted in “A Briefe Relation…” manuscript Life of Mary Ward written by her friends and companions Winifred Wigmore and Mary Poyntz.\n\n[35] “Memories of Loreto” Dublin, 1927.\n\n[36] In the Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals Mother Dympna Crowley has once referred to this Mother Stanislaus as “Mother Stanislaus Cousse Murphy”. I have kept the two surnames throughout in order to distinguish her from Mother Stanislaus Murphy Gould who appears very shortly afterwards.\n\n[37] “North-West Rebellions”, Major Charles A. Boulton, 1886.\n\n[38] Bishops Correspondence, Gibraltar Archives.\n\n9: “Noxious Miasma”\n\n[39] “Memories of Loreto” Dublin, 1927.\n\n[40] Central Archives, IBVM, St Stephen’s Green, Dublin, Ref.

See Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Alphonsus, 11th August 1860.\n\n[58] Manuscript of Mother Josephine Reddy, Central Archives, IBVM, Dublin, Ref. Z/15.\n\n[59] Land Registry, Gibraltar.\n\n[60] Ibid.\n\n[61] Extract from a type-written letter from Loreto Gibraltar to Rathfarnham written circa 1910, unsigned.\n\n[62] Land Registry, Gibraltar.\n\n[63] 1878 Census, Gibraltar.\n\n[64] French was always on the Loreto curriculum and later on the basics were taught for a time to some of the Senior Girls at St Mary’s Elementary School.\n\n[65] Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n[66] Catholic Diocese of Gibraltar website, http://www.catholicdiocese.gi/\n\n[67] Annals of the Christian Brothers: Brother Barry, quoted in “The Rock Under a Cloud”, Charles Caruana, 1989.\n\n[68] Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Austin Hearne, 8th September 1858.\n\n[69] Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Austin Hearne, 18th February 1859.\n\n13: Putting Things Right\n\n[70] “The Rock Under a Cloud”, Charles Caruana, 1989.\n\n[71] Sources are rather vague about its location, but it seems St Francis Xavier’s had to move twice (to Church Street and then to Waterport Street) before they finally settled in 1888.\n\n[72] Again, I have kept the two surnames throughout in order to distinguish her from Mother Stanislaus Cousse Murphy who left Gibraltar in 1886.\n\n[73] Annals of the IBVM, Spain.\n\n[74] When the “Bedenham” blew up over sixty years later the ceilings of this building were damaged, and the old cane and plaster showed through. The whole building (now large flats) has been refurbished and so little remains of the original 1882 features.\n\n14: Gavino’s Passage, Cornwall’s Lane\n\n[75] The grotto still exists and continues to be very well looked after since it was first put there by the Loreto Sisters.\n\n[76] One of the nuns from Spain joined the Gibraltar Communities for the purpose.\n\n[77] Research notes for “A Nun, her Friends and her Order”, K Tynan, 1891, Loreto Archives, Dublin.\n\n[78] Research notes for “A Nun, her Friends and her Order”, K Tynan, 1891, Loreto Archives, Dublin.\n\n[79] “Sany sany wosha ’n / De woshan wee / An de wee sany baybee / She cry fo me…” etc.\n\n15: Highwaymen and Convent Girls\n\n[80] Annals of the IBVM, Spain.\n\n16: Disaster in the Bay of Gibraltar\n\n[81] Giuseppe Codali supervised the cooking arrangements for the survivors at a camp set up outside Landport Gate. The Army provided bell tents, blankets, eating utensils, writing materials. A number of business firms and individuals in Gibraltar provided food, beer, coffee, cigars and a cash advance. [Information from the Codali family].\n\n[82] Confusingly the IBVM in England are called the ‘Roman Branch’ because they had their Generalate in Rome. Nowadays Loreto, the ‘Irish Branch’, also has its Generalate in Rome – right opposite that of the ‘Romans’!\n\n[83] Excellent Inspection results are mentioned several times in the Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n17: Boer War 1899 – 1902\n\n[84] “Our Unsung Heroes”, Tito Vallejo, 2001.\n\n[85] Ibid.\n\n[86] Annals of the IBVM, Spain.\n\n[87] “The Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary”, Rev.

They made space in it for several other people, among them two Sisters of Charity, a music teacher, the Bishop’s coach-driver and a cook. Sometimes the vault could not be opened because a recent burial had taken place so the nuns were occasionally offered space in other people’s vaults. The Loreto nuns who died in Gibraltar before 1887 were certainly among that number.\n\n[91] Mother Dympna’s writing in the Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n[92] Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n[93] The Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary”, Rev. Mother M Margarita, IBVM, MA, 1945.\n\n18: To End All Wars\n\n[94] Colonial Hospital – later “St Bernard’s” at the top of Hospital Hill.\n\n[95]Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n[96]Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.

Land Registry, Gibraltar.\n\n19: ‘Points of Manners’\n\n[100] An Essential Handbook of Victorian Etiquette, Professor Thomas E. Hill, 1994.\n\n[101] The cobbles in the principal streets had been removed over a hundred years earlier during the Great Siege in order to allow enemy cannon balls to sink into the soft earth rather than ricochet off them and cause greater damage to buildings. The removal of the cobbles meant that the streets were inclined to be muddy and so were boarded over until, with the advent of the motor car, they were surfaced with Tar Macadam.\n\n[102] See Appendix IV for an article on the history of the production and use of globes.\n\n[103] Land Registry, Gibraltar.\n\n20: Progress And Modernisation\n\n[104] Girls who attended “the Green Convent” in the 1950s (Loreto High at Convent Place, so called because of its green uniform) will remember all the rules about the making of the new uniform. The darts at the front were to be exactly six inches apart, the ‘divided skirts’ for games had to be one inch above the knee, and the hem of the tunic must touch the ground when you kneeled.\n\n[105] The first lines of the film’s theme song are:\n\n“¡María de la O!\n\nQue desgrasiaíta, gitana, tú ere\n\nteniéndolo tó.\n\nTe quiere reí,\n\ny hasta los ojitos los tienes morao\n\nde tanto sufrí.”\n\n21: Trouble in Spain\n\n[106] See “Haciendo de República” by Julio Camba, 1934, for an interesting and amusing article on how the Second Republic got it wrong in separating Church and State.\n\n[107] Annals of the IBVM, Spain.\n\n[108] Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.\n\n[109] Cf “The Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary” by Rev.
