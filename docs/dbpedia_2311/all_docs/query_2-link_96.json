        "text": "The King’s County Chronicle\n\nGeneral Advertiser for the Unions of Parsonstown, Tullamore and Roscrea\n\nVol. 1 – No. 1\n\nParsonstown, Wednesday September 24, 1845\n\nProspectus for the King”s County Chronicle\n\nFirst publication Wednesday, September 24th, 1845\n\nOur Prospectus\n\nThe leading object of this Journal will be to afford that attention to the interests of the King’s County, which its importance demands, whether as regards its central position, its agricultural and mercantile resources, or its rank, wealth and intelligence: in short, to give the county the full advantages of an efficient LOCAL JOURNAL.\n\nThe conductors of the King’s County Chronicle are experienced at the Press; and possessing a perfect knowledge of the local affairs of this portion of the Kingdom with other peculiar facilities, they will be enabled to produce a Journal worthy the distinguished character of the King’s County, and well deserving of extensive support.\n\nThe present is deemed a most favourable opportunity for the success of such an undertaking – when Railway intercourse must speedily bring into operation all those capabilities which conduce to the development of the vast internal resources of the country; and towards the success of which a newspaper is a most useful medium in any locality desirous to share in the general improvement.\n\nThe Agricultural, Commercial and Mercantile intelligence will be given from the best sources of information. The Mark-Lane Market of the previous Monday, and the Dublin Corn Return of Tuesday, will be obtained in time for immediate publication; while the ‘Stock and Share List’ will be quoted up to the latest period.\n\nAs an Advertising medium it will be found very advantageous, a Newspaper being the most suitable and effective medium of publicity; and from the extensive district with which this Journal will be identified, and the respectable classes by which it will be perused, the Chronicle must become a useful and efficient means of public communication.\n\nThe King’s County Chronicle will be published every Wednesday at 3 o’clock, by F. H. Shields, Parsonstown, and forwarded by that day’s mail in time for delivery same evening in the neighbouring towns. Subscription (payable in advance) : One Year : £1 : 1s: 8d ; Half-Year : 11s.

Antrim\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nThe Late Case of Embezzlement in Belfast.\n\nIt will be the recollection of our readers, that several months ago a young man named Briggs, a clerk in the employment of Wm. Garner, Esq., of Belfast, had absconded, carrying with him a considerable sum of money which had been paid into the office during Mr. Garner’s temporary absence; and that, notwithstanding the efforts which were made at the time by the police to discover the place of his retreat, he succeeded in escaping to America. It was afterwards determined that the culprit should be followed, and in case it would be required, the warrant for his arrest was signed by Sir James Graham, which, under the late treaty, authorized the officer of Justice in pursuit to enter the States. The person selected for this important duty was M’Williams, one of the Belfast detective force, and who, if the report at present in town is found to be accurate, has acquitted himself in a most creditable manner.\n\nNot credited to any newspaper\n\nWednesday, October 29th, 1845.

This Railway will proceed northwards by Killaloe, Nenagh, Cloghjordan, Shinrone, Parsonstown, Banagher, Shannon Harbour, Athlone, Ballymahon, Kenagh, Longford, Granard, Arvagh, Cavan and Ballyhaise to Clones, at which point, it will meet the traffic supplied by the Belfast and Ballymena, the Ulster, the Newry and Enniskillen, the Dundalk and Enniskillen, and the Colerain, Londonderry, and Enniskillen Railways ; thus concentrating, in its northern terminus, the intercourse of all the lines in that important portion of the country ; and on the south, being in direct communication with the various existing and projected lines to Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Tralee &c., it will bring the two extremes of the kingdom into immediate connection, effectually opening up the interior of the country, and necessarily tend to develop its almost hidden resources, while the fact of the line crossing the direction of all the channels of communication from East to West of the country without competing with any of them, forms a singular and strikingly advantageous feature in the undertaking.\n\nA preference will be given to the Shareholders in the existing Companies in connection with this line, in the allotment of Shares.\n\nNo application will be attended to that does not contain a reference to a Banker, Solicitor or other person of well known respectability.\n\nDetailed Prospectuses, with a plan, and forms of Applications for Shares, may be obtained on application to the Secretary at the offices of the Company ; to James Bryden, Esq., 19 Moor gate street ; to the Solicitors ; and to the following Share and Stock Brokers:\n\nDublin – Labertouche & Stafford;\n\nLondon – Carden & Whitehead, Threadneedle street\n\nLiverpool – Henry Waterton\n\nBelfast – Theobald Bushel\n\nCork – William Connell\n\nLimerick – Sarah Mahony & Son ; and Mark T.

Although Day was not a native of King’s County, and an utter stranger in Banagher, yet, Mr. Henry Sheane, of that town, having become acquainted with several local matters connected with the prosecution, and being impressed with a conviction of the man’s innocence, very praiseworthily made a representation of all the facts to the Hon Judge Crampton (before whom Day was tried), who favoured Mr. Sheane with a reply, informing him that his jurisdiction on the subject of the trial of Day was at an end, but that he had not failed to forward his representation to the Government; and we are happy to add, that Mr. Sheane’s exertions have not proved unavailing – as, although Day was on board the convict vessel, lying in Kingstown (Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin), his sentence has been commuted to 12 months imprisonment, from the 2nd inst., in the County Gaol of Tullamore, where he arrived on Friday last.\n\nBallinasloe\n\nThe Great Agricultural Meeting and Annual Cattle Show\n\nOf Live Stock, Horses, Sheep, Swine and Implements, Flax, Wool, Butter, Poultry, Seeds, Roots, Grasses, &c. &c.

Carlow\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nSerious Case of Stabbing\n\nA most serious case of the above nature occurred at Carrigslaney, County Carlow, on the 14th instant, which seems to have originated in some previous quarrel. Two men, named Philip Furlong and John Williams, alias Foster had some altercation at the above place, when Furlong asked Foster to fight him. Foster said he would not fight then, but go look for a person to be present, and who would see fair play. Foster then went away, and returned in a short time by himself, having a stick in his hand and a bayonet, which he concealed under his coat. Furlong asked him was he coming back to fight him, when Foster raised the stick, and gave Furlong a blow on the head. Foster then took the bayonet from under his coat, and stabbed Furlong in the breast and lower part of the body. A man named Thomas Dowdle, who came up at this time, ran to the assistance of Furlong, when Foster stabbed him in the head, from the effects of which he now lies dangerously ill, and very little hopes are entertained of his recovery. Informations have been taken before J. J. Lecky, and C. Wolseley Esqrs., and a warrant was issued for the apprehension of Foster, who has absconded.\n\n“Carlow Sentinel”\n\nAttempt to Burn a House\n\nOn the 16th instant, an attempt was made by some persons unknown to burn the house of a man named Robert Jolly, who resides near Clonegall, county Carlow. The thatch was set on fire near the eave, but the family being up at the time, the fire was discovered, and its progress checked before any serious injury was committed. That the outrage was premeditated may be known from the fact that a threatening notice was posted on his house about a month previously; but as yet no clue has been obtained that would lead to the discovery of the parties who committed this outrage.\n\n“Carlow Sentinel”\n\nCo. Clare\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nA young woman named Margaret Meer, who has been employed binding corn near Newmarket, on Thursday last met with a fatal accident in the following manner:- It appears that a number of the men had been engaged in reaping, and that having ceased from their work for the purposes of smoking, a man named Donovan ran away with a coal of fire and another man ran after him to take it from him, when Donovan turned suddenly from him, his hook, which was under his arm, entered the left side of the chest of the deceased, who was behind and quite close to him. It penetrated her heart, when she instantly fell, exclaiming she was killed, and died in a few moments. An inquest was held by Mr. Whitestone, and a verdict of accidental death found – the jury imputing no blame whatever on Donovan.\n\n“Clare Journal”\n\nCo. Cork\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nDeparture of the Squadron\n\nThe unexpected departure of the fleet took place on Thursday. After dinner on board the ships the signal for sailing was made, and in a short time the Albion, Canopus, Queen, Trafalgar, Superb, Rodney, St. Vincent, and Vanguard, had respectively given out their ample canvas to the wind, and were successively bearing out of the harbour’s mouth. Passing into the Atlantic they shaped their course S.E. by S. The Rattler and Stromboli accompanied them. The Crocodile and Tartarus alone remain in this harbour. It is said that several officers were left behind, so sudden was the order to sail. They will join their respective ships at Plymouth.\n\n“Cork Constitution”\n\nCo. Dublin\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nThe Briefless – Dublin\n\nA woman named Dillon complained on Wednesday to the Magistrates at the Head Police Office, Dublin, of a barrister who ‘offered’ her his services to prosecute a person named Haslam, against whom she had a complaint. Informations being granted in this case, the ‘worthy’ barrister slipped out behind his client’s back and pocketed the sum of ten shillings and sixpence by this ‘honorable’ transaction! Mr. Casserly stated that such persons were prowling about the police offices, and were a disgrace to the profession. Mr. Porter, himself a barrister, and one of the bench, stated: “I would sooner see the members of my profession, carrying hods of mortar, or cleaning out ash-pits than have them found acting in so disgraceful and unprofessional a manner. I don’t like to say anything harsh in the absence of the professional person who is here charged upon oath; but I cannot avoid considering the gentlemen of the English Bar, who have utterly acted upon such a hostile part to the Reporters of the Press – a body composed of Gentlemen of talent, and the highest order of genius, and remarkable for their good conduct, will think of the comparison, after they have heard of this case.”\n\nExtraordinary Sale of Cattle.\n\nWe (“Dublin Mercantile Advertiser”) have received a letter from a friend in Yorkshire, which gives the following account of a sale of cattle belonging to the Earl of Carlisle, at Castle Howard, a few days since: – 1 cow, “Sister Mary”, brought 189 guineas; 1 cow, 121 guineas 15s.; 11 pigs, 70 guineas 10s.; 32 cows, 1,611 guineas 15s.; 16 heifer calves 682 guineas 10s.\n\nFrankford\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nFROM OUR FRANKFORD CORRESPONDANT\n\nSERIOUS ASSAULT\n\nIn one of the lanes in this town there resides two families named Coins and Meaghers: the youthful members of both are continuously quarrelling, and causing much annoyance to their more peaceable neighbours. On Monday morning, Coine (sic) saw some of the young Meaghers beating his children, he followed them to their house, using very violent language, when Mrs. Meagher struck him with a broom in the face. Coine then seized a rake, with which he gave the woman a violent blow on the head, which fractured her skull. The matter having been communicated to the police, Head-Constable M’Guinness proceeded to search for Coine, whom he found concealed in a field. Coine, on seeing the constable made off, but was quickly pursued, and after a smart chase, captured. He has been fully committed to abide his trial at the ensuing Assizes. Mrs. Meagher has been removed to the County Infirmary, where she lies in a dangerous state. No hopes are entertained of her recovery.\n\nCo. Galway\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nHerring Fishery – Galway\n\nWe rejoice to state that in the recollection of the oldest inhabitant, there has not been a more plentiful supply of herrings taken in our bay than on Monday night last; and on every evening up to Thursday. The rough weather has interrupted the fishery since then but it is well that even for a few days the labours of those engaged in the trade have been attended with so much success. On Tuesday the herrings which wee of good size and flavour, sold at 12s. 6d. per thousand, but the price has since advanced.\n\n“Galway Mercury”\n\nThe Potato Crops.\n\nConsiderable alarm has been excited by the reports from various quarters, of a failure in the potato crop, this season; and though we rejoice to learn that there is no ground for apprehension in this neighbourhood, still the effect of the rumour has been to raise the price of this most necessary article of food. Potatoes which at this season are generally sold for 2½d to 3d now fetch 5½d per stone.\n\n“Galway Mercury”\n\nWednesday Oct 29th, 1845\n\nMrs. Oliver of Loughrea, unconsciously killed one of her children, by turning it up in a press bed, where the little innocent lay hid by the bedclothes from the eye of its parent\n\nGeneral News\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nRepeal Association – Monday.\n\nThe attendance in the hall was much more numerous, and the proceedings less dull, than on this day week. The death of the late Mr. Davis was principal subject of the speeches, and glowing panegyrics were pronounced by the various orators. Many other more conspicuous members were attired in the uniform of the ’82 Club, and were vociferously applauded on their appearance. The chair was filled by Counsellor O’Hea. Mr. J. O’Connell read letters from his father and W. S. O’Brien, Esq., deeply expressive of their sorrow at the premature demise of Mr. Davis, and of grief for the loss which his cause and his country has sustained. The rent reached £200\n\nThe Potato Crops.\n\nConsiderable alarm has been excited by the reports from various quarters, of a failure in the potato crop, this season; and though we rejoice to learn that there is no ground for apprehension in this neighbourhood, still the effect of the rumour has been to raise the price of this most necessary article of food. Potatoes which at this season are generally sold for 2½d to 3d now fetch 5½d per stone.\n\n“Galway Mercury”\n\nThe greater part of the week has been wet – heavy and incessant rain, occurring at a most unfavourable period, the crops being fit for harvesting all round this neighbourhood.\n\n“Sligo Journal”\n\nAs we heretofore announced, the crops in this county are superb ; the oats are far beyond an average, and what wheat has been cultivated, met with the utmost success – the best test of the quality of oats is to be found in its produce when ground, and we are gratified to learn that in every instance, where tested, it has given the utmost satisfaction. We have spoken to several farmers on the subject of the potato crop and their answers have been invariably, that they have not had better for many years, both as regards quality and quantity. The late rains have impeded the sickle within the last few days, but no material injury has yet taken place. We are happy to notice by the change in the barometer today, accompanied by a favourable alteration in the wind, that the prospect of the weather is cheering. The green crops of every kind present a most delightful and luxuriant appearance; nothing can exceed the prospect of Skirving’s turnips ; and the purple topped Aberdeens are also not inferior.\n\n“Westmeath Guardian”\n\nFROM OUR BANAGHER CORRESPONDANT\n\nI regret to inform you that the potato crops in this neighbourhood have suffered extensively. Few fields, if any have escaped, and the disease is daily spreading – a deplorable prospect, this, for the poor.\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Killaloe, is this day, holding a confirmation at the Cathedral of Clonfert. The visitation of the clergy and the consecration of the new church at Ballinasloe, takes place tomorrow.\n\nLord Dunally passed through this town en route to Garbally, on a visit to the Earl of Clancarty.\n\nOPINIONS OF THE JOURNALS\n\nUnder this heading we shall give the opinions of the leading papers of all shades, upon topics of prominent interest, without, however, holding ourselves in any way identified with the political doctrines thus promulgated.\n\nFrom ‘The Times’\n\nProtestant Organisation in Ireland.\n\nThe lovers of political sport will be delighted to hear that the prospects for next session are as good as ever. Notwithstanding the great exertions and the apparently destructive expenditure of the season gone by, it begins to be evident that the stock of grievances is undiminished, and the amateurs of the game are in their original strength and spirit. Orangemen and Repealers are urging on the extent of their preparations, and the intensity of their resolves. The Orangemen conceive that they have discovered in the example of their adversaries the road to success. As the circumstances of law being impracticable among a people opposed to its operation was the great plea for the “message of peace to Ireland,” the Protestant Party are beginning to calculate how near they can drive to the law, and how much of it they can reduce to a dead letter. The gentlemen of Ulster meet in the town-hall of Enniskillen, with the Earl of Enniskillen in the chair, “for the purpose of taking into consideration how far a union of all those who are ready to make common cause in upholding the religion of the Reformation could be formed in strict subserviency to the laws.” The circumstances of the times, so often pleaded for surrender and peace, and so convenient a topic for free-and-easy politicians, are their case of necessity for action. With very little affectation of delicacy, they give the world to understand that Sir Robert Peel’s political course renders it “absolutely necessary that a closer union should be formed amongst all classes of Her Majesty’s loyal and attached subjects in this country.” If such are the expressions of confidence Sir Robert receives from his old and faithful friends, what must he expect from his foes?\n\nWhile the Orangemen are making this use of Sir Robert’s boasted armistice, their opponents are even more vigorously, perhaps still, more effectually, at work. A public dinner at Castlebar, on the 29th of this month is to cement and declare the intimate union between the Liberator and the hierarchy of Tuam. A brisk agitation is to be commenced, with a special view to neutralise the bribery of Maynooth and the infidelity of the Colleges; and the men of Connaught are furnished with new arguments for that Repeal, which they are told can alone effectually secure their consciences and their creed from corruption:-\n\n“The plan of the common enemy heretofore (says Mr. O’Connell) was to extinguish Catholicity by force and violence, by the sword and by the scaffold, and more particularly by the plunder and iniquitous seizure of Catholic property.\n\n“But Satan now, grown wiser than before,\n\ntempts men by making rich, not making poor.”\n\nThe present plan is of a different kind. Defeated in actual persecution, the enemy seeks to bribe, to corrupt, to influence, to endow with patronage, and to purchase by various means a new dissension amongst the struggling people of Ireland.\n\nI am quite convinced that their foul intentions, aided though they be with British gold, will totally fail. The clergy, whom the people never deserted, will never desert them: and there is one thing certain – that the men of Connaught are not to be bought or bribed, any more than are the faithful Irishmen of other provinces.\n\nThere is indeed, one cause of apprehension, more recent than others – I mean the attempt to carry out infidel education. But we ought to be consoled by reflecting on the history of this scheme in other countries. The attempt to educate the people into irreligion has been openly made and avowedly pursued in Germany, particularly in Prussia, and more recently in France; but even in those countries, supported as it was by the undisguised power of Government, it has failed, and it will fail in Ireland as sure as the sun rises, and leave no trace behind it but the marks of the folly of its invention and the proofs of increased zeal, and even from the xxxxxxx(ink blotched – can’t read) excited in all good men on so iniquitous a project.\n\nFrom the Bristol Times\n\nAttempts are being made in the North of Ireland to re-organise the Orange Institution, on such a plan however, as to avoid an infraction of the law. The proximate cause of such resuscitation (should it take place) will be what we cannot but consider, the injudicious dismissal of Mr. Watson : Sir Robert Peel’s intention towards Ireland is good and a wise one, namely to assuage and remove party asperities; but the removal of Mr. Watson from the Commission of the Peace was just such an incident as to create quite a contrary result. Party spirit in Ireland, if allowed to escape freely, soon loses itself in vapour, but compressed or confined, like the element of steam, it become powerful and repulsive. Had Mr. Watson not been “victimised,” the ebullition would, in all probability, have begun and ended with the meeting at which he presided; opposed, however, it becomes in its condensed form, sufficient to shake a whole province.\n\nCo. Kerry\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nThe Hon. Wm. Browne retires from the representation of this county on the next election.\n\nNot credited to any newspaper\n\nA grand-daughter of the far-famed Kate Kearney may be seen at Killarney lakes this autumn, with the usual offering of goats’ milk and mountain dew to the lake visitors.\n\nNo paper credited.\n\nWednesday Oct 29th, 1845\n\nAction for Libel\n\nAt the Tralee Quarter Sessions on Tuesday, Messrs. J. and J. Eager, proprietors of the ‘Kerry Evening Post’, were found guilty of publishing, on the 12th of July last, an article reflecting on the character of Mr. Rickard O’Connell, Barrister-at-Law, and sentenced to pay a fine of £2 each.\n\nCo. Kildare\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nThe New Profession of Maynooth\n\nAn examination, which will hold a prominent place in the Annals of Maynooth, has terminated and the following are the new Professors: Rev. Mr. Furlong, Professor of Theology ; Rev. Mr. Behan, Professor of Logic and the Rev. Mr. Garghan, Professor of Belles Lettres\n\nPilot.\n\nCo. Limerick\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nLimerick Harbour\n\nThe Tidal Harbour Commissioners visited Limerick, and held an enquiry there on Thursday. Mr. Rea, Collector of Customs, stated that notwithstanding the disadvantages heaped on Limerick, its custom duties had increased in the last 20 years from £58,000 to £170,000 per annum. The shipping in 1825 was 560 tons: in 1845, it was 14,086 tons. At the conclusion of the inquiry, Captain Washington said he had been up the Shannon, and had never seen a nobler or more beautiful river. What struck him as extraordinary was, that it was possible it could have been so long and so grossly neglected. There was great blame attributable somewhere – he could not now say where. He trusted however that the obstructions to the navigation would be speedily removed, and that the desired improvements would be effected, and the vast resources of Limerick developed – for there was not in the British Empire a port which possessed greater qualities.\n\nNot credited to any Newspaper\n\nThe General Mining Company for Ireland – The Railways.\n\nWe are gratified to hear that 7,000 shares have already been subscribed for in this national undertaking. We are pleased to find the nobility and gentry, as well as men of science, giving their countenance and support ; and with such patriotic names as Lord Dunalley, Viscount Massareene and Ferrard, Hon. Mr. Prittie, and others we have sen among the Directors, joined with Dr. Graves, of Merrion Square, and wealthy merchants of Dublin, we augur success.\n\nLead has risen cent. Per cent., and this company have, we understand, the most extensive and valuable lead mines in Ireland, and are in treaty so ass to secure fields of copper and coal. This will give employment to the people and great profit to the proprietors\n\n“Limerick Chronicle”\n\nCo. Longford\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter received in this town on Monday last from Toronto, in Upper Canada, dated August 26th, only three weeks since:- “The Rev. Mr. Davis and Mr. Dease were here last week on a collecting tour for the Longford Roman Catholic Cathedral. I understand they have collected throughout the States, in the last two years, about forty thousand dollars” (which at 4s. 2d each would amount to 8,333 guineas, 6 shillings and 8 pence.)\n\n“Longford Journal”\n\nLusmagh Parish\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nFiring into a dwelling.\n\nOn the night of Tuesday last, about the hour or eleven o’clock, a party of armed men visited the dwelling house of a small farmer, named John Deane, residing at Gloster in the parish of Lusmagh, they fired a shot through the door and another at Deane’s dog. On the following morning, Deane found a notice signed ‘Captain Rock’ at his door, threatening ‘eternal desolation and death’ to his son Michael Deane, if he continued to work for Mr. Lyster, of Derinsallagh Mills, at a lower rate of wage than is usually paid to carriers. Constable Kearney and party at Lusmagh, have been unremitting in their exertions since the occurrence, to discover the perpetrators, but without effect.\n\nParsonstown\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nPARSONSTOWN UNION\n\nAdmitted during the week – 6\n\nRemaining on preceding week – 202\n\nTotal – 208\n\nDischarged – 7\n\nDied – 0\n\nRemaining on Saturday the 18th – 201\n\nSick in hospital – 18\n\nExterns – 23\n\nAverage expense of pauper per week £0 1s. 4 3/8 d\n\nTotal expense of provisions and necessaries £15 7s. 11½d.\n\nIn consequence of the calamitous prospects of the potato crop, the Guardians of the above Union came to the resolution that the paupers should in general use a potato diet, thereby saving the oatmeal for a future period. There is a special meeting summoned for Saturday next, to take into consideration the most judicious means of guarding against the worst consequences. It would be well if the poor could be persuaded respecting the relative saving between potato and oatmeal diet; as in the Work-House here the week’s expense for dinner was £3 9s. 3 ¾ d, while for breakfast it was only £2 8s. 8 ¾ d., for the same number.\n\nPETTY SESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n(FROM OUR REPORTERS)\n\nPARSONSTOWN – Saturday\n\nBefore Thomas Hacket, Esq., and Captain Kelly, R.M.\n\nTwenty two cases were entered for hearing.\n\nDRUNK AND DISORDERLY.\n\nA wretched looking creature named Kennedy – whose tattered garments, dilapidated hat, and soiled shirt, the collar of which bore soil marks of a nozey origin, denoted his attachment to the mountain dew – was placed at the bar, charged with having been found in Cumberland street, in a state of happy forgetfulness. Sub-Constable Casey stated that he found the defendant lying across the pavement, he raised him, but his endeavours to make him resume the perpendicular were utterly fruitless – as he bent his body forward, and then, by his own centre of gravity, would descend to the curb stone. By the aid, however, of a powerful shake or two, he showed some sign of consciousness, and, was removed. The Constable stated that the defendant caused a good deal of annoyance, as he was surrounded by a crowd of pugnacious little boys and girls. The defendant stated that he met with some friends, who treated him to two “croppers” and not having tasted food for some hours previously, total insensibility followed, accompanied by a desire to dispense with the luxury of a bed for the coolness of the pavement. A verdict of guilty was recorded against him, and he was fined two shillings and sixpence; but not having the ‘needful’ he was locked up for 24 hours.\n\nPICKING POCKETS\n\nJohn Fitzpatrick, a young, but frequently convicted pickpocket, in physiognomy an exact facsimile of Thornhill’s popular portrait of Jack Sheppard, was charged with stealing £1 7s 6d, from the pocket of a man named Hugh Larkin. The prosecutor a remarkably stupid old man, deposed that a few hours previously, he was passing along the Main Street, which was very much thronged with people, the prinsoner jostled him, put his hand into the pocket of his pantaloons, and took there-from a one pound note, and three half-crown pieces. He did not catch the hand, but felt it, and kept the prisoner in view till he was arrested. He under-went a very searching cross-examination by Mr. Dowling, solicitor, who appeared for the prisoner. Sub-Constable Nicholson deposed that he arrested the prisoner, and found on his person a pound note and some coppers. Mr. Dowling addressed the Bench, and remarked that the money found by the Constable was not the same that Larkin alleged to have lost. The Bench gave the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, an discharged him. The other cases consisted of petty assaults and common trespass, and did not possess the slightest interest.\n\nPhilipstown\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nFROM OUR PHILIPSTOWN CORRESPONDANT\n\nThe Quarter Sessions for this division of the county, commenced on Monday morning last, before William N. Barron, Esq. Assistant Barrister.\n\nEight persons were registered, all Repealers.\n\nThere were 7 ejectments entered for hearing, six of which were at the suit of Lord Ashtown: Mr. Mitchell, Solicitor, ably defended each case for the tenants. There are one hundred civil bills entered for hearing, and only eight criminal cases to be disposed of, which is very creditable to the people of the district.\n\nThe fair of this town was held on Saturday last, and was rather thinly attended, the supply of sheep and milch cows, was very small, fat pigs and stores, brought remunerating prices, and very much sought after. All passed off peaceably, very few drunken cases were apprehended by the Constabulary.\n\nA large quantity of cattle, corn &c., seized for rent, due on the lands of Killeashin of H. O’Neill and R. Billing, Esqrs., of Dublin, was to be sold by auction, on Friday last, and in consequence of the bailiffs having been attacked some days previously, when making the seizure, a party of the Constabulary were in attendance to preserve the peace, but no sale took place, an amicable arrangement having been entered into.\n\nThursday last, was the usual day for holding the Petty Sessions of this town. Several suitors attended, but were obliged to return home without having their cases adjudicated, in consequence of the non-attendance of Magistrates, which causes much inconvenience to the inhabitants of this town and neighbourhood.\n\nThe Great Hibernian Central Junction Railway\n\nWednesday, October 29th, 1845 (Vol. 1 – No. 6)\n\nThe Great Hibernian Central Junction Railway\n\nRegistered Provisionally\n\nCapital £2,000,000, in 80,000 shares of £25 each –\n\nDeposit £2 12s. 6d., per share.\n\nPower will be taken by the Act to allow four per cent upon the calls.\n\nProvisional Committee\n\n(with power to add to their number)\n\nThe Right Hon.

This Railway will proceed northwards by Killaloe, Nenagh, Cloghjordan, Shinrone, Parsonstown, Banagher, Shannon Harbour, Athlone, Ballymahon, Kenagh, Longford, Granard, Arvagh, Cavan and Ballyhaise to Clones, at which point, it will meet the traffic supplied by the Belfast and Ballymena, the Ulster, the Newry and Enniskillen, the Dundalk and Enniskillen, and the Colerain, Londonderry, and Enniskillen Railways ; thus concentrating, in its northern terminus, the intercourse of all the lines in that important portion of the country ; and on the south, being in direct communication with the various existing and projected lines to Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Tralee &c., it will bring the two extremes of the kingdom into immediate connection, effectually opening up the interior of the country, and necessarily tend to develop its almost hidden resources, while the fact of the line crossing the direction of all the channels of communication from East to West of the country without competing with any of them, forms a singular and strikingly advantageous feature in the undertaking.\n\nA preference will be given to the Shareholders in the existing Companies in connection with this line, in the allotment of Shares.\n\nNo application will be attended to that does not contain a reference to a Banker, Solicitor or other person of well known respectability.\n\nDetailed Prospectuses, with a plan, and forms of Applications for Shares, may be obtained on application to the Secretary at the offices of the Company ; to James Bryden, Esq., 19 Moor gate street ; to the Solicitors ; and to the following Share and Stock Brokers:\n\nDublin – Labertouche & Stafford;\n\nLondon – Carden & Whitehead, Threadneedle street\n\nLiverpool – Henry Waterton\n\nBelfast – Theobald Bushel\n\nCork – William Connell\n\nLimerick – Sarah Mahony & Son ; and Mark T.

Sligo\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nShocking Murder – Sligo\n\nWe are sorry to state that this county has been disgraced by a most diabolical murder, not connected, however with either party, religion or agrarian outrage. A man named M’Hugh, with his wife and her sister, were at Sligo market last Saturday, and after leaving the town, the husband directed the wife to return for some article which he said she had forgot to purchase. She returned to Sligo, and her sister wished to accompany her or to wait for her, but the husband in a most abusive manner told her to go on and they would overtake her. The unfortunate wife never reached her home alive. She was discovered on Monday morning in a potato field in Geevagh, near her residence, her body bruised in several places; and from the marks of a ligature round her neck, Dr. Burrowes is of opinion she died from strangulation. Mr. Meredith Thompson held an inquest on the body, and a verdict of murder was returned against the husband, who has absconded. We understand that the circumstantial evidence against the husband is strong.\n\n“Sligo Journal”\n\nThe Potato Crops.\n\nThe greater part of the week has been wet – heavy and incessant rain, occurring at a most unfavourable period, the crops being fit for harvesting all round this neighbourhood.\n\n“Sligo Journal”\n\nLord Palmerston arrived here on Thursday, to visit his property in this neighbourhood. We understand that he purposes remaining for a few days.\n\n“Sligo Journal”\n\nCo. Tipperary\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nTipperary Mode of Paying Rent\n\nIn our publication of Saturday last an advertisement appeared for the sale of the produce of five fields of wheat, two fields of oats and some hay, distrained by the receiver under the Court of Chancery for rent due on that part of the Derry Castle estates, amounting to upwards of £200, and which was to be sold at auction on yesterday (Friday). Bailiffs to the number of seven were placed over the property, who visited it every day to see that all was right. On Friday morning, however, upon going to the lands, there was not a vestige of the produce to be seen – not a single straw was left behind – the lads having made clean work of it during the previous night, to the great disappointment of the receiver, the auctioneer and the bailiffs.\n\n“Nenagh Guardian”\n\nFrom our Roscrea Correspondant – ( County Tipperary)\n\nDARING ATTACK\n\nA most savage and brutal attempt was made on the life of Doctor Downer, near the Post Office of this town, about the hour of 11 o’clock on Thursday last. He was attacked by three or four fellows, armed with bludgeons, who knocked him down with their murderous weapons, inflicting several extensive wounds and bruises on his head and body, from the effects of which he is confined to bed. The only cause that can be assigned for this very daring attack is, that Doctor Downer, a most efficient officer in the Loan Fund Institution here, took an active part, some short time ago, in detecting a fellow, who attempted to defraud the establishment. His friends will be happy to hear, though very seriously injured, he is likely to recover.\n\nROSCREA POOR LAW UNION – Ex-officio.\n\nGuardians elected on the 11th inst., for the year ending 29th September 1846.\n\nThe Hon. Francis A. Prittie ; Colonel Lloyd ; J. W. Fitzpatrick, Esq. ; John Minchin, Esq. ; Henry White, Esq. ; Thomas Spunner, Esq. ; M. H. Drought, Esq. ; Guy Atkinson, Esq. ; and Maunsell Andrews, Esq.\n\nThere are at present 275 paupers in the Workhouse of this Union, principally composed of women and children.\n\nSuicide\n\nOn Wednesday night last, about 12 o’clock, a young man, by trade a tailor, named Michael Butler, while in a state of temporary insanity, committed self-destruction, by suspending himself by the neck with a rope, from a beam in his own house, in the Gravel Walk, in the west suburbs. An inquest was held by Wm. Ryan, Esq., coroner, when the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the above facts.\n\n“Tipperary Constitution”\n\nWhiteboy Offences.\n\nOn the night of the 15th inst., five armed men entered the dwelling of Michael Behan at Knigh, and threatened him with death if he neglected to make his son quit the employment of a gentleman in the neighbourhood. When leaving the house, they fired three shots.\n\nOn Sunday night last, an armed party of five or six in number, attacked the dwelling of a man named Edward Burke at Curraghaneddy, broke open the door, dragged Burke out of bed, knocked him down, and while down, continued beating him for a considerable time: they then placed him on his knees, and ordered him to pay a girl who had been in his service, they fired several shots outside his door, and then ran away. Two men named Michael and Thomas Burke, from Toomavara, have been committed for this outrage.\n\nSome few nights since, a party of men went to the house of a man named Dan Carroll, at Ballincarra, when one of them asked to be admitted. Carroll was from home, and his wife of course refused to open the door, upon which, the dastardly and murderous gang, discharged the contents of a gun through the window, without however, effecting any personal injury to Mrs. Carroll.\n\nFriday night last, Head Constable Brown, of Toomavara, discovered a blunderbuss concealed in a ditch at Pallas on the land of a person called Hogan ; it was in excellent order, being locked in a wooden case, like a small coffin.\n\n“Nenagh Guardian”\n\nMelancholy Occurrence\n\nAn Awful calamity occurred at a place called the Bogside, near Borrisokane, on Tuesday night last, about ten o’clock. A man named Patrick Farrell and his family, consisting of his wife and four children, retired to rest at about nine o’clock; they were not in bed more than an hour, when the eldest son called to his father and said that there was smoke in the house. The father and son instantly got up, and thought to get out the door, but they were so bewildered that they could not for some time make it out ; by this time, the house was in flames over their heads, the father, mother and two eldest children succeeded in getting out, but, melancholy to relate, the youngest children were burned to ashes – one sevenand the other nine years of age.\n\nIt appears that Farrell was scotching wheat on Tuesday, and placed the scotched sheaves in such a position that they came in contact with the fire. Poor Farrell is almost distracted, having lost all that he possessed in the world, except his life, and that of his wife and two children as above stated.\n\n“Nenagh Guardian”\n\nCo. Waterford\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845\n\nAlderman Delahunty of Waterford declares that the doom of Messrs. Wyse and Barron, as representatives for that city, is sealed, and that they must turn out for two Repealers.\n\nNo paper credited.\n\nThe Right Rev. Dr. Foran of Waterford, and his clergy have withdrawn from the local repeal agitation.\n\nNo paper credited.\n\nCo. Westmeath\n\nWednesday, October 22nd, 1845"
