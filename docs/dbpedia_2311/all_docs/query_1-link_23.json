PUBLISHED AT TORONTO THREE TIMES A YEAR— SUBSCRIPTION $2.06 A YEAR To the King of Ages The new Chapel of Loretto Abbey, where His Eminence James Cardinal McGuigan on December 8, 1953, opened, with Pontifical Mass, the Marian Year for the Archdiocese of Toronto. Editorial 'X'he Loretto Rainbow celebrates with this issue -*■ its sixty-first birthday. When the first issue appeared in 1893 at Loretto-Niagara, the journals of the day spoke encouragingly of it: The Guelph Herald: Thi- Rainbow is the title of a charming publication issued quarterly from Loretto Convent, Niagara Falls. It contains twenty-eight pages of the choicest reading material from the pens of the young lady pupils, as well as contri- butions from the ablest writers of the day. The book is exquisitely gotten up, the paper, style, letter press being faultless. It deserves a successful career. The Empire, Toronto: Published in the interest of students who attend an institution founded by the late Archbishop Lynch within sight and sound of the thundering waters of Niagara, The Rain- bow contains much that is of general as well as local interest. True Witness, Montreal: ... an admirable publica- tion, The Rainbow comes from Loretto Convent, Niagara Falls. It spans with its prismatic literary beauties a grand space in Catholic literature, and it recalls the turbulent and majestic chasm over which stands the Convent of Loretto. Its name, no doubt, was inspired by the lovely arc of colour that spans the American-Canadian border, but it had a deeper significance, too, as the following lines portray: The Rainbow And God said . . . and the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant that was made between God and every living soul. — Genesis IX. The Rainbow is a golden arch That binds old love to new; It glimmers, then bursts out again. With sunlight streaming through. The Rainbow is a covenant Between my school and me. To memories of Loretto days It is the magic key. Long since for covenant God placed His rainbow in the sky, A pledge to men — as ours to us — That love will never die. Beryl Black, Form 11 A, Loretto College School from The Rainbow, July, 1932. In this Marian Year, it points another message. St. Pius X, on the golden anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, speaks joyously of Mary as the hope and comfort of the world. \"We are surely passing through troublesome times . . . yet in the midst of this deluge of evil, the most merciful Virgin is there before us in full view, like a rainbow, as an arbiter, making peace between God and man. Let the storm rage and the sky darken; still we shall not be dismayed.\" Thi: Loretto Rainbow continues, then, as the bond of the love of Loretto's children for one an- other, and a token of their common love of Mary. wwwiww^^ 5'^^sss:: Her immaculate virginity conquering the flesh Her martyrdom at the foot of the Cross vanquishing th Her triumphant faith confounding the devil 9 Our Lady went into a strange country And they crowned her for a queen, For she needed never to be stayed or questioned But only seen; And they were broken down by unbearable beauty As we have been.

Mary^s Honr The proviamatioBi o/ Mary^n 4$ueenHhip in the proelawnaiion of Mnry^n HoMtr 'X'he YiiAR OF Mary draws rapidly to a dose. -'- In one last burst of spleadour the proclamation of her Queenship, while it may close the Marian Year, begins a new phase of our atomic era. The crisis of the present time has its parallel in history, it is true; take the threat to Christianity from Islam, for example; but Islam was a religion, and now the very idea of religion is under attack. The struggle is no longer between Christianity and some inferior form of religion, but between the worshippers of God and the worshippers of the world. Two outlooks on life stand opposed; on a scale of world dimen- sions the future of civilization lies at stake before our eyes. Pitted together for the perdition or the salvation of humanity are the armies of evil, draw- ing their ultimate inspiration from Satan, and the armies of God. Since this conflict far surpasses all our estimates of strength, we must look upon it realistically, but we have every reason to look upon it without fear. Guiding the heavenly host is Mary, Queen of the Universe. He who said \"No\" to God is at grips with her who said \"Yes\": The opening shot was fired at that instant of her Immaculate Conception, when, ex- empt from primal sin, she forced her adversary to lie in wait for her heel. Today, when the tempo of the struggle is accelerated, as God's standard-bearer she carries unspotted the divine title of nobility. Herself terrible as an army in battle-array, through her in- vincible purity, she will bring the armies of God to victory. But if she is menancingly hostile to the enemy, she is maternally tender to her own, as with a sure and gentle hand she leads them to her Divine Son. They have only to enroll in her army by fulfilling her de- mands at Fatima: the daily Rosary, sacrifices for sin- ners, and consecration to her Immaculate Heart. Their very existence may depend upon this acceptance. Moreover, union with her confers upon her soldiers a special kind of courage in the face of the possible. Her own incomparable courage of soul was the first to believe in the impossible — ins. her followers with a splendid daring. With the hungry and thirsty for God, this is not the the practice of routine religion. When war br men stop judging events by conventional st THE MOST REVEREND Francis V. Allen D. D. Titular Bishop of Avensa Auxiliary to the Archbishop of Toronto /^N October 7, in St. Michael's Cathedral Cardinal McGuigan consecrated the Most Reverend Francis V. Allen, D.D., Bishop of Avensa and Auxiliary to the Archbishop of Toronto. The splendid and traditional ceremony was an occasion of felicitation and prayer for Loretto where Bishop Allen's visits in the past years as secretary to His Emminence have made him a familiar and loved figure. The date of Bishop Allen's consecration, the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary in the Marian Year, and his motto \"Ad Jesu Per Madam\" initiate his episcopacy with Marian significance. May the Immaculate Mother continue to procure for him from her Divine Son all the graces in abundance which will enable him to carry on a magnificent apostolate. \"Let us pray for Francis Valentine, Bishop. May the Lord watch over him and grant him length of days, happiness upon the earth, and deliver him not to the will of his enemies.\" His Excellency Giovanni Panico signs the guest-book on the occasion of his blessing the new wing at Loretto College School. With him are Monsignor Brennan and Knight Joseph O'Reilly Tn What Monsignor McDonough calls To- ■*• ronto's \"outstanding week,\" the visit of Canada's new Apostolic Delegate, His Excellency Giovanni Panico, is one of three contributing factors. In fact, His Excellency lent his dignity to the other two, Bishop Allen's consecration and Father Lord's Mar- ian Pageant. On Monday, October 4, His Excellency blessed and formally opened the new addition to Loretto College School. Received at the entrance of the new school by a Guard of Honour of Knights of Columbus, he proceeded to the auditorium through double ranks of students, singing the \"Ecce Sacer- dos\". In the name of Mother General and the entire community of Loretto nuns, Monsignor Brennan warmly welcomed His Excellency, and offered the loyalty and devotion of the nuns to the Holy Father through his distinguished representative. In His Excellency's princely bearing and classic features, his dignity tempered by a gracious friendliness, is all the personal charm we in Canada had come to asso- ciate with His Excellency's predecessor. Most Rev- erend Hildebrand Antoniutti. His twelve years 'fin Australia, where he knew Loretto well serves further to endear him. Australian Loretto, like our own, Distinguished Guests npHE Holy Father sent as his representative to -*- the ten-day National Marian Congress at the Cape His Eminence Cardinal Valeri. The arrival of His Eminence in Canada began for him a busy schedule of liturgical functions, and civic and private receptions during which he won all hearts. His visit to Loretto Abbey was an occasion for great joy. His Eminence Cardinal McGuigan had invited him to meet there the representatives from the thirty women-religious communities in the Arch- diocese. In his simple and touching words he ad- mitted his own gratitude at having been chosen for the signal honour of crowning our Lady for His Holiness. He spoke of the deep impression left with him of faith of the Canadian people, of the wonder- ful work of the religious (His Eminence attended the Congress for Religious in Montreal), and has assured the nuns that he would bring to the Holy Father first- hand assurance of their love and allegiance. He dwelt at length on the great privilege teachers have in giving Mary, the special patroness and model of every virtue, to young girls, future mothers, whose families would in turn be dedicated to her. Every detail of the day, the golden sunshine, the Saturday Mass of our Lady, the exquisite floral ar- rangements, the meeting of friends, and the gracious charity of Cardinal Valeri himself marked this day as a special one in Loretto's annals. he said, had grown from a tiny seed, well watered by the sacrifices of the saintly pioneers. He men- tioned Mary's Mount Ballarat where the nuns' simple kindness to Elizabeth WolflP-Metternich won them a little-dreamed of, but generous Ballarat reward. The day following the Brunswick opening, Hi.s Excellency said Mass at the Abbey, and later was presented with a spiritual bouquet, as well as ad- dresses in both English and Spanish. The Latin- Americans were proud and happy to have His Ex- cellency speak to them personally. With his last twelve years spent in Peru, he spoke familiarly of what is home to them, impressing on them the best possible use of their opportunities for leadership. To the student-bodies of both the Abbey and Brunswick, His Excellency graciously gave that school-girl boon — a holiday. DECEMBER 8, 1953 His Eminence Opened the Marian Year for the Archdiocese of Toronto in all the splendour of a Pontificial Mass at Loretto Abbey. Monday the 7th was filled with preparations for the solemn opening of the chapel and of the Marian year. It was a day of anticipation, such as Christ- mas eve used to be in our childhood years. Prepar- ations were going on in the cafeteria where breakfast would be served to the Alumnae, in the parlour dining-rooms where the Cardinal and the priests would have dinner, in the junior refectory across the hall where the twenty-one seminarians would dine, in the kitchen and the bakeroom, with volun- teers added everywhere to the sisters in charge. Someone said afterwards that the harmony with which all these sections dovetailed their endeavours was remarkable, surely an evidence of Our Lady's gracious presence. We had decided earlier that it would be impossible to invite all our friends and benefactors and all those who had part in the erection of the chapel, and, so since it was a Marian event, we would limit it to our city alumnae. Eight hundred announcements were sent out, but since it was a weekday, not all would be able to attend. In the libraries by afternoon all the vestments were laid out, the Cardinal's in the Bishop's room opposite. The new gold vestments in memory of Rev. Mother Pulcheria, chasuble, dalmatics, copes, tabernacle veil and frontal, had come from France some time ago and were waiting for this first event. Albs and surplices were the special ones made for the cen- tenary, including the gorgeous lace crocheted by M. M. Amanda. In the second library were the capes, etc., for the seminarians. The Cathedral had kindly lent all the extras required for the Pontifical High Mass. In the chapel the sacristans were busily setting up the throne, and extra chairs and benches, besides decorating the altars. The high altar had great gold vases filled with a wealth of calla lillies sent by Elsie Moreno, while the altars of Our Lady and St. Joseph were adorned with great white 'mums sent by our Detroit Alumnae. The altar cloths were those recently made by the artistic fingers of our dear M. M. Benedetta's mother. One went about from place to place to offer help or just to look on with joyful awe. Tomorrow would be one of the great days in our history. And so it was. His Eminence arrived promptly and Msgr. Brennan, too, as Archpriest, and Msgr. Callaghan and Msgr. Kirby as Honorary Deacons. These we had the prvilege of inviting. The others were arranged for by Rev. B. J. Mahoney of St. Augustine's Seminary, who was Master of Ceremonies. Our bus brought him and the Seminarians back and forth. Our music was never more beautiful. Msgr. Ronan had written special harmonies for the proper of the Mass, dedi- cated to the occasion. His cathedral choir duties prevented his being present. All was elaborate cere- mony and yet so intimate and full of peace. The Alumnae to the number of about 150 received Holy Communion. It was thought that one of the priests would give Holy Communion, but the Car- dinal did so himself, and all considered that an extra privilege. It was en famille, as it were. After Mass and investing, His Eminence came out to speak in his simple appealing way of the double reason for this event, and of what the Holy Father would expect of a group like this, already pledged to Our Lady, in this special year of prayer, for the Church and the people in the persecuted countries. After- wards, breakfast in the cafeteria and dinner in the dining-rooms carried the same element of peaceful joy that blossomed into cordiality. Our \"girls\" of all ages were very happy and lingered to say so and to visit. The seminarians had time for a ses- sion in the bowling alley before the bus was due to take them back to St. Augustine's. In the quiet of the rest of the day and of the evening, as one went into the chapel, one was conscious of a special sacredness, as after a great sacrament. Laus Deo semper! from the \"Community Annals.\" 8 Xavan Nuns npHE story of St. Gregory's is the story of the baby ■*■ who grew too large for his cradle. Bishop Gercke solved the problem by \"cutting the baby in half.\" So here in Phoenix we have a new little brother-parish, St. Simon and Jude, just one year old. At the time of severance, the children of the amputated section presented a problem by cling- ing to St. Gregory's School. Everyone faced the problem and helped. Before the end of this first year, Father Smith — pastor of St. Simon and Jude — has built a permanent church and four beauti- ful classrooms. Even in Phoenix, the city of fast constructions, this is considered phenomenal. Yet Father Smith amazed his parish still more by secur- ing Sisters to staff his school. Undaunted by the answers from many American Motherhouses that there were not enough Sisters to supply a new parish with teachers, Father Smith carried his problem back to his native Ireland. He knocked at the convent of the I.B.V.M. in Navan, and was well received. Across the ocean in America, in a rather distant corner, lying hot and parched in the sun, is a city called Phoenix. Poor children there have no Catholic school because there are no Sisters available. In this Marian Year, as a special act of sacrifice, the com- munity of Navan will go to these children. Who will go? Will someone volunteer? Father asks for five. The whole community stands up. Back in Phoenix, Father Smith hurried over to St. Gregory's to share his good news with us. Now things are a bit different in Ireland, and would Mother St. Felix write to the Sisters in Navan? Thus began the correspondence that proved so help- ful to the missionaries. There were many questions to ask — about school, about climate, about clothes. The nuns from Ireland reached Chicago in August. They were the guests of our nuns for about a week. It was a busy time, visiting all the convents and the novitiate at Wheaton. There was shopping to do, too. The plane from Ireland had allowed very limited baggage. And besides. Mother St. Felix had advised them to take advantage of American stores and American prices. That was a pleasant memory — the visit in Chicago — surrounded on all sides with American warmth and hospitality. Then came the trip by train to Arizona. The long train ride is the best way to understand the distance. Forty hours of fast riding brought them at last to Tucson. In Tucson the Bishop welcomed the nuns officially to the Diocese as his special charge. because the Navan I.B.V.M. is diocesan. We had to wait another whole day to see them. Mother Superior had a special party dinner planned for their arrival. How good it was to see those five smiling faces with their very rosy cheeks and Irish blue eyes ! In no time at all, like typical school-teachers, we were comparing notes, telling stories, explaining local conditions, and deploring the age-old prob- lems. Mother Kieran is the superior of the gallant little community. Her companions are Sister Angela, Sister Aithne, Sister Jude, and Sister Carmel. The parishioners are more than pleased with the Sisters. Any fears they might have harbored are all allayed by these friendly, cultured, willing women. With a tradition of teaching behind them, they have already taken their place in the ranks with the other com- unities of the city. The nuns have been very well impressed with our people and our way of life. Outstanding have been their constant remarks on the generosity of the people. Coming on a mission, it is always impressive to find a well-stocked pantry. And it seems nothing at all was forgotten by the good people of the parish in the outfitting of the little house for the nuns. Our lovely, friendly children have made the greatest impression on the nuns. Every time we meet the Sisters they expostulate all over again about \"how good the children are.\" Perhaps they had some preconceived idea in Ireland that American children were diflScult and different. No matter. The children have convinced the Sisters that they are made of the same stuff that heaven requires. And there are enough children enrolled in the four grades to be really convincing — over two hundred. The nuns have remarked about the determination of the children to attend Catholic schools. They were amazed to learn that many of our children work to pay for their books and, if need be, their tuition. Across the ocean, they say, if the parents cannot afford to pay, the children submit to their fate and do without. In one way we have confused our Irish Sisters. It is hard for them to understand, surrounded as they are with manifestations of American generosity — it is hard for them to understand the scarcity of American Sisters. Why in the land of the open hand are so few willing to give their lives to God? It is a confusing thing, even to Americans. Mother Mary Clark, I.B.V.M. IN that \"perpetual hymn of everlasting love,\" as Shelley calls the Paradiso, the \"dolce stil nuovo\" reaches its highest pinnacle. With Dante, human love becomes ethereal, transcendant, identical with divine love. In \"The Divine Comedy,\" love soars up- ward unto love, until it loses itself in the ecstatic vision of II Primo Amore. Never is the strain more divinely sweet than when the great Master sings the praise of Mary, the Mother of God. Here, as everywhere through- out the \"Divine Drama,\" only the Catholic heart, nurtured with Catholic doctrine and tradition, can thrill in perfect accord and sympathy with the great Catholic poet. In Christ's unchanging Church, — to-day, as in the thirteenth century, the hearts of Mary's children turn to her with the same ardent love that burned in the heart df John, when from the lips of the dying Christ, he heard those tender words, \"Behold thy Mother!\" When Virgil is about to conduct Dante through the region of gloom, he explains that he is the emissary of Beatrice, to whom Lucia has been sent by \"a noble lady in Heaven,\" whose prayer has power to alter the decrees of Divine Justice. Mary's name is too sacred to be uttered in Hell. Accordingly, she is not mentioned again, until in Purgatory, the poet hears from Buonconte di Monte- feltro the story of his violent death, which should have plunged him in Hell but for Mary's inter- cession. Fleeing wounded from the field of Camp- *'Now raise thy view Unto the visage most resembling Christ, For in her splendour only shall thou win The power to look on Him,'* aldino, and 1)loodying the plain, sight failed him and speech, but his last word was the name of Mary. That instant she was with him, and the \"little tear\" of repentance had saved his soul. Gardner calls that \"lagrimetta\" of the dying knight, — \"one of the priceless pearls in the treasury of the world's poetry.\" In the Valley of the Princes, sitting on the grass amid the flowers, are seen those who on earth were deadliest enemies. Here are Rudolf of Hapsburg and Ottocar of Bohemia, Philip III. of France, Peter III. of Arragon, and many other royal foes. Now they are side by side, comforting each other as they sing together \"Salve Regina\" to the Mother of Mercy. EMPLAR OF VIRT m Ascending the Mount of Purgation, the path winds around the seven terraces on which are expiated the seven deadly sins. At the entrance to each rocky height, examples of the opposing virtue are either pictured in the rock, or quoted in speech or song, and the first and lovliest example is always taken from the life of Mary. Up the steep, narrow path that ascends the first terrace where Pride is purged away, the souls of the proud move painfully along, bowed down under heavy weights. On the white marble of the moun- tain side are carved beautiful images of humility. \"She was imaged there. By whom the key did open to God's love; And in her act as sensibly imprest That word, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord,' As figure seal'd on wax.\" On the second buttress of the mount is purged the sin of Envy. The sinners, clothed in penitential garb, their eyes sewn up with wire, lean pathetically against the rock. Spirits flying by them cite sweet instances of Charity. \"The voice that first flew by call'd forth aloud, 'They have no wine.' \" On the third cornice, the sin of Anger is expiated in black and blinding smoke. Here are examples of Meekness and Forgiveness. 10 \"At the entrance Stood a dame, whose sweet demeanor did ex- press A mother's love, who said, \"Child! why hast thou Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I Sorrow- ing have sought thee.' \" On the fourth terrace, the slothful, who are ex- piating defective love, rush by at full speed, impelled by eager longing. 'Two spirits at their head Cried, weeping, 'Blessed Mary sought with haste The hilly region.' \" The sin of Avarice is cleansed on the fifth height, where the covetous and prodigal lie prone in the dust. -Here \"midst the wailing\" the poet hears a voice cry out, \"O Blessed Virgin\" . . . \"How poor Thou wast . . . witness that low roof Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.\" On the sixth terrace, the spirits of the gluttonous suffer the torments of hunger and thirst, tantalized by the sight of tempting food and drink. From the trees above them, unseen voices proclaim examples of Temperance. \"From amidst the leaves, A voice was heard: 'Mary took more thought For joy and honour of the nuptial feast. Than for herself, who answers for you.\" On the seventh and last cornice, sensual passion is purged in fire. Here, the spirits are divided into two bands, and go in opposite directions chanting examples of Chastity. With one of these bands, Dante converses, and in answer to their wondering looks, explains that this journey has been vouch- safed him in the flesh, that he may no longer live in blindness. \"There is a Dame on high, who wins for us This grace, by which my mortal through your realm I bear.\" NOROUS PAGEANi When the ascent is completed, the poet find themselves in the Garden of Eden. Here they be- hold a wondrous pageant, which typifies the trium- phant progress of the Church. With dazzling light and music ineffably sweet the procession advances. \"All sang one song: 'Blessed be thou among The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness Blessed forever!' \" Finally in a shower of flowers, Beatrice descends from Heaven and Virgil disappears. Beatrice now acts as his guide, and leads him up through the nine heavens to the spaceless, motionless Empyrean of Divine Love. \"As the glory of Beatrice crowns the Purgatorio,\" so the greater glory of Mary wreathes in light the Paradiso. Here we have an outpouring of Dante's devotion to the Blessed Virgin. From heaven to heaven, all things lovely are referred to her; her praises are sung by all the blessed; she is called by all the sweet names so dear to long generations of Catholic piety, — \"Queen of Glory,\" \"Mystic Rose,\" \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit,\" \"Living Fountain.\" To consider these titles apart from their poetic setting is to detach the rarest gems from a rich mosaic. As they soar higher and higher, Beatrice becomes more dazzlingly beautiful and \"in her eyes such fulness was of joy\" that the poet cannot withdraw his enraptured gaze. \"Why doth my face,\" said Beatrice, \"thus Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn Unto the beautiful garden blossoming Beneath the rays of Christ .'' Here is the Rose Wherein the Word Divine was made incarnate.\" With sweet simplicity, the poet tells that every morn and eve he duly invoked \"the name of that fair flower.\" At its mention he turns his gaze up- ward into the brilliance beyond, and lo, he sees a crescent descending, which circles round the brightest star \"in fashion of a diadem.\" \"Whatever melody sounds sweetest here. And draws the spirit most unto itself, Might seem a rent cloud, when it grates the thunder, Compared unto the sounding of that lyre, Wherewith the goodliest sapphire that inlays The floor of Heaven was crowned.\" m^^-^m^' It is Gabriel who comes to crown Our Lady. As he circles round her, he tells her in his song that he is Angelic Love, that he will hover round her forever and ever, that because of her presence, diviner joy shall \"gild the highest sphere.\" \"Such close was to the circling melody And as it ended, all the other lights Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.\" The eyes of the poet strain upward for a glimpse of Mary's Son, but his mortal sight is yet too feeble to pursue \"the crowned flame.\" He sees the other lights yearn upwards to her, and he hears 'Regina Coeli' so sweetly sung that the delight thereof can never leave him. Beatrice conducts him still higher. When they finally reach the Empyrean his sight is strengthened 11 A cherished moment is caught here on the occasion of Mother Yvonne and Mother Mary Aloysius's trip to Rome for a more intimate view of the saints, and of the Blessed Mother. Beatrice now leaves him and re- sumes her throne of glory. Her place is taken by St. Bernard, who prepares him for a yet higher flight: \"For so, by ray divine Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount; And from Heaven's Queen, whom fervent I adore. All gracious aid befriend us; for that I Am her own faithful Bernard.\" Looking up, he sees the Queen of Heaven seated in state, with thousands of Angels disporting round her, singing and waving pennons. \"At their glee And carol, smiled the Lovely One of Heaven.\" Bernard gazes with exceeding fondness and his love for Mary finds its joy in kindling other hearts: \"When he saw mine eyes Intent on her, that charm' d him.\" Under the guidance of Bernard, Dante con- templates the Sempiternal Rose of Paradise, where the Divine Light is unimpeded, and where saints and angels are absorbed in an ecstasy of love. Here are the saints of the old law on one side, and the saints of the new law on the other. By contem- plating their glory and the ineffable beauty of Mary, the poet is prepared for the crowning glory of the Beatific Vision. Bernard once more directs his gaze to Mary. \"Now raise thy view Unto the visage most resembling Christ, For, in her splendour only shalt thou win The power to look on Him.\" Again Dante looks upon her face, radiant with all the joy of all the blessed. Gabriel, on poised wing before her, sings his eternal \"Ave Maria, Gratia Plena,\" and all the blissful court resounds with that sweet anthem. Bernard now addresses to the Queen of Heaven that beautiful prayer, \"O Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son!\" Herein he tells her that from all eternity she was predestined to be the mother of the Redeemer, — that she has ennobled our human nature, — that she is a torch of love to heaven and earth, and a spring of hope to mortal men. All graces come to us through Mary. \"So mighty art thou. Lady, and so great, That he, who grace desireth, and comes not To thee for aidance, fain would have desire Fly without wings.\" Bernard entreats her to obtain for Dante the grace to contemplate the Divine Essence now, and the further grace to persevere under her protection after his return to earth, that he may rejoice in the Beatific Vision for all eternity. The eyes, which Mary turns upon her suitor give evidence of the love with which she ever looks on pious prayer. In answer to Mary's intercession, Dante beholds the vision that constitutes man's last and perfect beatitude. \"Thenceforward, what I saw. Was not for words to speak, nor memory's self To stand against such outrage on her skill.\" The prayer which Dante puts on the lips of Bernard is a cry of longing from the depths from his heart, and all the love and devotion which angels and saints show to Mary are essentially the poet's own.

Miss Phelan's hero, Asher Mundy, is the boy who ran away. Up Lake Erie he goes with his artist-friend, the Paul Kane of history, to Mackinaw; from Mackinaw to Fort Sault Ste. Marie, on to Fort Garry, and even to Fort Edmonton. His readers share his adventures every exciting mile of the way across the vast West, where discoverers, traders and missionaries are making history. Father Lacombe, whom Asher meets at a critical moment, tells him: \"You will find what you want; but now you do not know what is is you want.\" To the rebellious Asher, who knew exactly what he wanted, the statement was both irritating and puzzling. Its explanation comes with great satisfaction in the last pages. The maps on the covers and the black-and- white sketches by Vernon Mold at each chapter head heighten the story, already made vivid by the graphic quality of Miss Phelan's prose. Miss Phelan was born in Hamilton. When she matriculated from Loretto Convent in Guelph, she was awarded the Knights of Columbus Fellowship, which took her to Loretto College, and to honours in her B.A. in History from University of Toronto. With the Alex- ander MacKenzie Fellowship she acquired her Master's degree. She taught for several years, did post-graduate work in history in the States, and is now a librarian in the Toronto Public Libraries. Her fascinating biography of D'Arcy McGee, THE ARDENT EXILE, has won a number of awards, among them the Governor-General's in 1952. Within the pages of THE RAINBOW, where are recorded with love and pride the achievements of Loretto's children, Josephine's teachers offer her their warmest congratulations. To their love for a very dear pupil is now added joyous pride in her literary star in its ascendancy. The Reverend Joseph Killorin, son of Mrs. James Killorin of Stratford, one of the two first Canadians ordained in India TV/^TH THE Reverend John Prendergast, S.J. in '^ .Canada from Darjeeling, India, we have news of the mission activities there. Father is the pastor of the Immaculate Conception Church, and Head- Master of St. Robert's High School, where both the Rev. Vincent Morgan, S.J. and the Rev. Joseph Killorin, S.J. taught before ordination. These two priests were the first Canadian Jesuits to be ordained in India. The mission grows, however, and two more will be ordained in November. \"Cather Killorin 's mother, in a visit to the Con- -^ vent in Stratford this summer, told of her visit to India at the time of Father's ordination. Both in Calcutta and in Darjeeling she enjoyed the hos- pitality of the Loretto nuns. Loretto House in Cal- cutta, she told us, was once owned by the Governor of Bengal. \"June, 1768\", scratched with a diamond on one of the window-panes, marks the birthday of the son (or grandson) of the first Governor, Van- sittart. Clive is said to have ridden up the main stairs on horse-back to claim a bet. Before the days of Loretto, of course! In Darjeeling (where the tea is the finest in the world), Mrs. Killorin spent almost three months. Father Joe lived at Archbishop's House in Dar- jeeling for two years before his ordination, assist- ing Father Prendergast, where he grew to know the Loretto nuns. They have a high school there run on the Cambridge system. It was with them that Mrs. Killorin stayed, and she spoke with deep gratitude of their goodness to her. 13 United Nations Revision Conference \"There is no limit to the magnificent work which Catholics can achieve for international peace in the United Nations,\" says Jerome d'Souza, S.J., member of Indian's delegation to the U.N. in 1949 and 1951, r\\^ February 12, Loretto Abbey will be host ^-^ to all the Loretto schools wishing to parti- cipate in a Model Revision Conference of the United Nations. Last year's Model Political and Security Committee Meeting sponsored by the Inter- national Relations Club at Loretto Abbey, proved most successful, made so in no small measure by the inspiration which Mr. Robert Keyserlingk, Editor of The Ensign, brought to it as guest speaker. His approval of this method of training alert citizens is the encouragement for this year's meeting. Several considerations prompt the choice of a Revision Conference. In 1955 the United Nations will be ten years old. That year has been set down as the time to take a fresh look at the organization. Under Article 109 of the Charter, the General Assembly must consider calling a General Review Conference, any proposals of which, adopted by two-thirds of such Conference and ratified by two- thirds of the members of the United Nations, in- cluding the permanent members of the Security Council, become effective as amendments to the Charter. The Model Charter Revision will provide a valu- able opportunity for promoting discussion on tech- niques and procedures for strengthening the United Nations through amendment processes. The United Nations has, in spite of its deficiences', achieved considerable success in the maintenance of international peace, though at terrible loss to life and property. The relatively local fighting in Greece, in Indonesia, in Kashmir, in Palestine, was con- tained after direct intervention by the UN authority. The Korean War was brought to a close by pres- sure of the United Nations in arms and in a UN council chamber. Pope Pius XII has spoken with cordial approval of the efforts of those striving for a world government. And with all its defects and shortcomings, the UN is the beginning of world government. Yet the General Assembly's action is limited to recommendations, while the veto power can paralyse the Security Council. And so far there is no effec- tive enforceable disarmament. There are, then, specific areas for amendment, and the Subcommittee on Juridical Institutions of the Catholic Association for International Peace sug- gests these: Note: For a list of suggested reading on United Nations topics, please turn to page 48. 1. There should be throughout the Charter, under- lying the structure and actions of the United Nations, recognition of the basic principle that no state is absolutely or unqualifiedly sovereign, that under the moral law the common good takes precedence over divisive nationalism. 2. Universal, enforceable disarmament with full international control of atomic, biological and chemical weapons — indeed, the elimination of war itself — must be achieved. This entails effective inspection methods and the power to impose prompt and certain sanctions either against offending nations or individuals. 3. There must be some limitation of the veto power now exercised by the Great Powers, at least, liberalization in such questions as the Charter amendment process, admission of new members, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the imposition of sanctions. 4. The General Assembly must be given the power to legislate international law. 5. Compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice should be established, along with the means of enforcing its decisions. For the Model Revision Conference at the Abbey the following specific amendments will be con- sidered for debate: relating (1) to membership — the making of membership universal; (2) to security — the more effective maintenance of it by the Security Council or the Assembly; (3) to the veto — its elimination or restriction, and the conditions thereof; (4) to the voting system of the General Assembly — the substitution of the weighted system for the one-vote-per-nation system; (5) to effective and enforceable international law. The above constitutes a tentative agenda within the equally tentative program of one morning ses- sion, with a \"bloc\" meeting of member-nations, and two further sessions in the afternoon. Some time in November the names of the sixty member-nations will be sent to each school from Loretto Abbey; each school will then select the five countries in order of preference which it wishes to represent in the Model Revision Conference. The member-nations will be assigned to each school on consideration of the earliest post-mark. 14 A MARIAX DISCOVERY \"/^UR Lady Appeared to him with ^^her heart pierced through with three swords; at the same time, he heard an interior voice saying to him that the Blessed Virgin was always submissive to the Will of God, even though her heart was often in deep sorrow. He realized, then, that in adversity he should take her as a model of what God expected of him.\" God expected a great deal of St. Jean de Brebeuf, as Father Rague- neau's account of the Huron missions goes to prove: nine more years of privation, ending in a barbaric mar- tyrdom at the hands of the Iroquois. Truly, adversity was a familiar com- panion of this Jesuit. Just as true, however, is the fact that he remained firm in his decision to imitate Our Lady in her courageous love of God. And in 1649 sealed with his blood the bond. That day of March 16 saw his eternal reward. Within the golden months of this Year of Mary a special event reminds us that compacts with Our Lady touch many lives. That event is the dis- covery of the grave of St. Jean de Brebeuf at Fort Ste. Marie. The monument to Brebeuf and Lalement, which stands on the site of the buildings long destroyed, owes its existence to Ragueneau's account of their burial in the Relations, but until this year, the exact location of the grave was unknown. Researchers knew only that the bodies had been buried at Ste. Marie in 1649, had been exhumed in the same year, the bones removed and the grave resealed; but where the graves were in that maze of buildings remained a mystery. Considering that the normal depth of excavation has been eleven to twelve inches, the prospect of digging down to grave level without some plan of attack was unthinkable. The Fort was not a small place by any means, and few areas could be defi- nitely ruled out. Father Denis Hegarty, S.J., archeologist, fortu- nately did have a plan, or more cor- rectly, a clue, to the whereabouts of the grave. An ancient Indian belief attributed to man two spirits, the life- spirit and the bone-spirit. It was, therefore, the custom to bury leaders in the Council House in order that the bone-spirit might always be with them. Was it not possible that the Fathers who buried Brebeuf might have given this honour to him, a leader among the Indians for so long, and consequently- that his grave. might be found in the Great Council House, the Indian Chapel? The Chapel and the adjacent ceme- tery had been excavated as early as 1950, but no trace of the grave had been found. However, Father Heg- arty resolved to dig to a lower level within the church itself. By mid- July of this year the East End had been explored with no result. Dis- appointment that the grave was not found within the sanctuary was some- ^ / what lessened by the fact that it was fairly common in the 17th Century to bury the dead in other parts of the church. The painstaking search, therefore, went on. Perseverance was rewarded, appropriately enough a few days before the feast of the Assumption. On Friday, August 13, an area of disturbed earth eighty- eight inches by forty-two was found near the door that led out into the cemetery. On the following Monday, at a depth of three feet four inches the first nail was found. Jean de Brebeuf had, indeed, been buried close to his flock, his grave the actual focus point of the roughly triangular cemetery. Time had, of course, destroyed the rough wooden coffin, but at three feet, six inches the black outline of the coffin could clearly be seen in the white sand, although only a few nails and some black fragments, presumably knots, remained intact. Time, however, could not remove the most wonderful content of the grave, the small lead plaque, pictured at the begin- ning of this article. There could be no doubt that this plot of earth had once contained the body of the Jesuit martyr. That it cannot be referred to as his final resting place is due to the desire of his fellow-Jesuits to take the bones of this holy man with them when they were forced to abandon St. Marie. But analysis of soil from a dark discoloured area a third of the way from the bottom of the grave may yet prove to be the lye in which the body had been boiled to remove the flesh. If so, it will be holy ground indeed, and we may feel more strongly that St. Jean de Brebeuf still lies at the Martyrs' Shrine as guardian and guide to the followers of Mary. — ]oaii S caul on.

MISSION IT CAME INTO BEING thus: In 1945, shortly be- fore the end of World War II, the city of Mayence (Mainz) in Germany suffered heavily by bombing. When the Motherhouse of the Rhenish Province of the Institute was hit by incendiary bombs, and water was lacking to extinguish the blaze, the nuns promised that if God preserved their convent, they would open a foreign mission. The Mother General, an eye-witness, tells that suddenly and quite inexplicably the fires stopped. Eight nuns volun- teered for the promised mission. Swiss priests, called the Bethlehem Fathers, had just begun a pagan mission in Southern Rhodesia. The news of their need for Sisters came quickly enough to Mayence. In February, 1951 the first four members left for South Africa. At St. Anthony's, the first mission in Zaka, the nuns have a thriving dispensary and a school. In August, 1952, Mother General of Rome spent five months there. A second group of four nuns arrived shortly before her departure, and the new mission of Serima, 180 miles from St. Anthony's, has begun. The I.B.V.M.'s at St. Anthony's Mission, P.O. Zaka, Southern Rhodesia, S.A., with Reverend Mother General Edelburga there on her visit from Rome Twice a year on Christmas and Holy Saturday the catechumens are received into the church. The last weeks before baptism they live at the mission. The money, sent by the friends of the missionaries, serves for the support of the catechumens at this time. Among the thirty-three received at St. Anthony's on Holy Saturday of this Marian Year three were boys ransomed by the students at Loretto Abbey. And speaking of ransoms: A family in Cologne ransomed Joseph Kiwanuka, in just the same way that many other people ran- som pagan babies. When their own son died, their interest in Joseph became greater, and to their joy, when he showed signs of a priestly vocation, they were able to help him financially with his studies. The years passed quickly enough, and Joseph was ordained. In time, he, with nine others, was consecrated bishop by Pope Pius XI. His rejoicing \"parents\" in Cologne had their wedding rings melted into the gold of his episcopal ring. In 1950, Joseph Kiwanuka, the first native bishop of Uganda, visited Europe. His \"mother\" was dead, but his \"father\" accompanied his bishop-son through Germany. His cup of joy was full that day the Bishop of Limberg entrusted to Bishop Kiwanuya, in a colourful departure ceremony, twenty-five white missionary priests for the diocese of Uganda. Thus will continue forever the history of the alms that ransomed one pagan child. TO LORETTO FRIENDS Passion Sunday, April 4, 1954. My dear little Loretto friends: You have been waiting a very long time for that letter I promised you. The days have slipped into weeks and soon it will be Easter. It will be a thing of the past when this arrives but you may be sure there is room in my heart for each and every one of you, daily, at Holy Mass and often many times a day, in just a wee prayer. Very often I feel too that I am being remembered and prayed for away over there, in the very rooms and grounds I loved so dearly all my life. There are no \"quakes\" or \"typhoons\" to tell about this time — at least, not grave ones. Spring has really come and there are so many lovely blos- soms — I do hope they last until Easter. I still haven't recovered from the \"avalanche\" of beautiful greetings I received from Loretto- Niagara at Christmas time. I believe there were 40 letters in all — so, I know you all by name now. So many of the streets are very familiar to me. I was especially delighted to hear of so many new schools. Sunday, April 25 th — And so this is as far as I got on Passion Sunday. I will try again to finish this now. On April 9th, there was a lovely letter which enclosed a cheque from Grade 9B, and all the love of everyone. How deeply grateful I am, dear girls, for the many little sacrifices you must have made to be able to send such a grand \"Easter Gift\" to far-away Japan. The huge box of Christmas cards, too, was really beautiful and will be put to very good use. We had a very beautiful Easter with all the ceremonies in our tiny Chapel. I am afraid it was almost amusing though on Holy Thursday. There was no one to serve Mass. Spring holidays in Japan do not centre around Easter, but are always from the 25th of March to the 8th of April, and school had just reopened, so our two faithful little altar boys dare not take a holiday again. When Father brought the Blessed Sacrament into the Sis- ters, Chapel where our Repository was prepared, the little out-sister had to slip out to the Sanctuary and carry the censor in for him. On Easter Sunday one little boy made his First Holy Communion. How proud his dear father was — a little farmer from the next village — very, very poor. The father himself was only baptized four years ago. I remember the day his three little boys were baptized — it was October 15th, 1950, my Feast day^ — ^and Father called them \"Peter, James and John.\" So, this was Peter the eldest. It rained very heavily Easter morning. The little farmer waited long after everyone had left — then, towards the end of break- fast the door bell rang — he came to present his darling son, for \"congratulations.\" Of course we would have been disappointed if he hadn't, and so Sister Cook had prepared a pot of hot coffee with what looked like dozens of half slices of bread and peanut butter. That doesn't sound like a Feast day treat, does it, girls? But, to that poor little man and his wee boy it was a never-to-be-forgotten breakfast treat. Of course there was a pretty Rosary and many little pictures for Peter besides, and a tiny box with caramels which our dear Sisters at the Toronto Monastery sent. The father ate very sparingly and asked could he please take the rest home to James and John and baby Mary Theresa and their blind mother — but we expected that too — that was why Sister had prepared so much. The weather has been ideal this past week — if only it could stay. Everyone has been very busy house-cleaning all week because very very suddenly any day now the horrible damp weather will be upon us, then depressing heavy heat and so we must have the cleaning done before that. In Japan we must house-clean twice a year — spring and fall — in the spring to prevent mildew and in the fall to dust away any that may have formed and undoubtedly in many places it is just unavoidable. On Friday, April 30th, one of our little Japanese Sisters will make her First Profession — her name is Sister Immaculata. The Bishop always comes for our ceremonies of Profession but he must attend a meeting of the hierarchy in Tokyo on that day and we are so disappointed that he cannot come. His Excellency speaks English very well and perfect French. I will remember you especially at exam time again and hope you will all return to meet at Mary's feet at Loretto. I will beg her to watch over each one during vacations; stay close to her and make many little sacrifices for the success of this her Year of Triumph. When Japan knows Mary it will be converted — the Japanese have the deepest re- spect for a Mother! Would that they knew this sweetest, loveliest of all Mothers. And please \"don't forget to remember me\" dur- ing holidays; if you have nothing to do, then you could sit down and drop a line to Sr. Mary Teresa. Lovingly and ever gratefully in the Blood Divine and in Mary's Immaculate Heart, Your Missionary Friend and Loretto's, Sr. Mary Teresa, Rel. Ad. P.B. Monastery Precious Blood, 200 Amanuma, Chigasaki-Shi, Kanagawa-Ken, Japan. The above letter was received from Sister Mary Teresa (Susan McQuade), a Niagara alumna. With her in Japan is Sister Mary Emmanuel (Teresa Hickey) of Loretto College School. They are members of the Precious Blood order, whose mission was founded from the Toronto Mother House. 18 Essay Contest for High School Students l^D^ 1.

The following quotations are affixed as merely suggestive: \"... since the time of the Council of Trent the lay element in the apostolate has come to the fore and made steady progress. There is no lack of proof for this fact. But it will be sufficient to recall the work of the Sodality of Our Lady in the further- ance of the apostolate in every domain of public life, and also the increasing part played by women in this same field of action in recent times. In this connection two outstanding figures in Catholic his- tory can be recalled to mind: Mary Ward, that in- comparable woman whom Catholic England gave to the Church to help her in those dark and terrible times of anguish.\" Pius XII to World Congress of Lay Apostolate, Rome, 1950. \"If there are enough women in the world to accept the vocation of woman, and really to fulfill it, it is they who will save it from ruin, and turn to good the social ambitions, the political plannings, the reasoned search for a reasonable world-order, which are the work of man.\" \"Women's influence is silent, secret, self-effacing, patient. But we shall miss the meaning if we think of it as something passive. It is active and creative; it not only sustains activity, but calls it forth. That is indeed the most obvious fact about woman throughout the course of history: it is her fate to bring about either what is best or what is worst in men. . . . We can see the two possible alternatives very clearly, if we look at the contrasting figures of Eve in the story of Genesis and Beatrice in the Comedy of Dante.\" Gerald Vann, O.P. in Eve and the Gryphon \"It is not quite easy to express what goes to con- stitute the ideal woman. . . To understand woman's true role in the world we must go back to the origin of things and see what she is destined for by Almighty God, the Author of Nature. Genesis tells us that God made the woman to be the helpmate of man. If this is the ordination of nature, it is unnatural, and therefore, bad, that she should be a rival. Neither is it according to nature that she be a mere echo of man. She must be a helpmate, and therefore be able to have a sympathetic interest in and an understanding of, his work and the questions and difficulties to which it gives rise — all this without usurping his place. \"... The true woman for her perfection must al- ways combine the spiritual beauty of virginity and maternity. She must have the grace, modesty, and restraint of the virgin, with the dignity, tenderness and devotedness of a mother.\" \"... The great woman who finds a place in the memory of mankind is the one who calls forth worth and goodness in beings round about her, who is the inspiration of brave undertakings, who fosters ideal- ism, who sustains the fainting arms, who conjures away tears or dries them, who creates high moral traditions, who civilizes society and increases the sum of happiness in the world; who, in a word, dominates, not by force, but by wisdom, by good- ness, and by sane vision.\" By Edward Leen in What is Education.? 19 IXTER-LORETTO FIELD DAY HELD AT GL ELPH 'TpHE Annual Loretto Field Day, held on Octo- -*- ber 7, the feast of the Holy Rosary, in Guelph Exhibition Park was attended by the Abbey, Bruns- wick, Notre Dame and Loretto-Guelph. Hamilton, Stratford and the Falls because of their Toronto trip to the Marian Pageant two days later were unable to be present. The lovely crisp autumn day, dedicated to Our Lady with the singing of \"In Thy Name, O Mary\" moved all too quickly through its events. To add to the usual excitement, Brunswick produced from their bus no one less than Marilyn Bell. Sylvia Soligo made a presentation to her from Loretto, Francis Fraser from Notre Dame, and Mayor Wor- ton from the city of Guelph. Marilyn received all these graciously and happily. The end of the day saw the three champions pro- claimed: Barbara Pryor and Anne Craven, tied for the Junior; Mary Kay Guise, the Intermediate, and Mollie Bennett, the Senior. The hospitality and friendliness of Loretto-Guelph play no small part each year in the success of the Field Day, and this year was no exception. This year several new records were made: Baseball Distance Throw: Junior: 86 yd. 2 ft 6 in. by Barbara Pryor (Notre Dame) . Intermediate: 82 yds. by Mary Sullivan (Abbey). Senior: 35 yds. 1 ft. 4 in. by Pat Palmer (Abbey). Running High Jump: Junor: 4 ft. 6 in. by Barbara Pryor (N.D.) Senior: 4 ft. 6 in. by Mollie Bennett (Loretto- Guelph). Shuttle Relay: Senior: 54 sec. by Loretto-Guelph. Running Hop, Step and Jump: Senior: 30 ft. by Iris Kelly (Abbey). Intermediate: 30 ft. 3 in. by Mary Kay Guise (Brunswick). Students from all Loretto schools were happy to meet Marilyn Bell at the Guelph Field Day. Shown with her here are Marie Tessarola and Velma Valeriote. 20 Rainboiv Retrospect SIXTY YEARS AGO Loretto Academy, Niagara Falls: We gratefully acknowledge the honour done to us by the dedication of Mr. Reiger's composition, \"Ave Maria Loretto,\" to the pupils of our Academy; the more highly do we feel flattered as this charm- ing production has been pronounced to be one of the best by this gifted composer. While we duly praise the music, we must not forget to render a tribute to the merits of the poetry to which it is wedded, by the Hon. T. V. Welch, whose beautiful senti- ments of Maris Stella are so fittingly expressed. Both words and melody are bound to become the traditional class song of the future Loretto graduates. The complimentary dedication of this beautiful hymn to us is appreciated not only on this side of the Atlantic but also in the time-honoured cradle of the Irish branch of the Institute, Loretto Abbey, Rathfarnum, Dublin, where our esteemed friend, on the occasion of his recent visit, left some copies. How sweet the thought that the voices of Loretto's children in the Emerald Isle and those privileged to dwell within sound of the mighty cataract Niagara mingle in one great anthem of praise to the \"gracious, holy name\" of their heavenly Queen! FORTY YEARS AGO Loretto Abbey, Toronto: On Friday, January 30, a distinguished audience assembled in the auditorium of Loretto Abbey to hear Mr. Wilfred Ward lecture on \"The Four Great Cardinals.\" As this was the only place in Canada to be visited by the famous biographer on his American tour, great interest in the event was mani- fested by the intellectual public of Toronto, and notwithstanding the rather unpropitious hour (three o'clock) they attended in large numbers. Mr. Ward was introduced by His Grace the Most Reverend Neil McNeil, whose few direct and effective words showed his appreciation of the work done by Mr. Ward, and of the subject to be dis- cussed in the lecture. , Mr. Ward, who has had the rare advantage of being personally acquainted with Wiseman, Man- ning, Newman and Vaughan, is eminently fitted to speak of these four great Churchmen. As a son of W. G. Ward, the distinguished convert of the Tractarian Movement, he has had exceptional oppor- tunities of knowing the trend of Catholic thought in England during a long period. We had before us one who knew Newman, and whose father was Newman's intimate correspondent. The characters of the four great men were charmingly differentiated by their most salient traits. Wiseman, the wonderful genius, with the heart of a boy; Manning, the ascetic, and lover of the poor; Vaughan, a knightly heart, capable of achieving wonders; Newman, the sweetest and most delicately fashioned soul joined to the greatest intellect. The little story of the artist, who on seeing Vaughan's face, told Tennyson that she had seen Sir Launcelot, was delightful, and the anecdote about W. G. Ward's relations with Newman and the charm of the latter's conversation, not a little pathetic. At the close of the lecture, the Arshbishop inter- preted the sentiments of the audience towards the distinguished lecturer, after which a short reception was held before Mr. Ward's departure for Chicago. Incidentally, Mr. Ward's daughter was at school with our nuns at St. Mary's, Cambridge. She evi- dently inherits something of the literary gifts of both her parents, having composed a play which Mr. Ward himself set to music, and which was presented at St. Mary's. Mr. Ward spoke very warmly of the English nuns, particularly Mother Loyola and Mother Salome. Loretto College On being appointed to the responsible post of athletic editor, the present writer, not being richly endowed with imagination begged the girls to be- come athletic. They went out at once and took three skates on the rink. Moreover, they had solemnly promised to play a game of tennis when examinations are over in May. They keep a tennis racquet in the corridor to show their sporting pro- clivities, which is very handy as a weapon against mice and bats. Once last year they were seen looking at the basketball field, and a report was circulated that they intended playing a game some- time, but it appears they were taking the altitude of the posts by observing the shadow. Some of the older girls declare they took part in a game of ball three years ago, but it isn't fair to take the reader back to pre-historic times. As long as Religious Knowledge and Philosophy lectures take place at four o'clock, athletics will be a negative quantity at Loretto College. 21 Loretto Academy, Stratford: \"The play's the thing\" says Hamlet, and so said we all Tuesday evening as we watched the students of Loretto Academy play their parts in the garb of Shakespearean heroes and heroines. The Pageant opened with a great glittering pro- cession. \"Public Opinion\" (Antoinette Kennedy) received the re-incarnated Shakespeare (Dorothy Riddell) and presented to him his characters: \"thus shall it be done to the man whom we delight to honour.\" First to come were Julius Ceasar (G. Gaff- ney), Calpurnia (M. Mclllhargey), Marc Antony (V. Duggan), Brutus (M. Kemp), Cinna the poet (M. Coughlin) and Cassius (A. McCarthy). The next scene presented was Macbeth: Duncan (M. Carbert), Macbeth (V. Carbert), Lady Mac- beth (M. Kearns), Malcolm (T. Longeway), the Witches (J. Dillon, M. Kelleher and M. Dolan). The \"Moonlight Scene\" from the Merchant of Venice was delightfully given by Marie Egan as Lorenzo, M. Holman as Jessica, A. Kennedy as Nerissa, A. McDonald as the Doge of Venice, while Portia's plea for mercy was well delivered by G. Kelley. The dazzling Cleopatra (M. O'Brien), the dainty Desdemona (M. Kennedy), the bewitching Juliet (N. Brisson), the sighing Romeo (M. Ken- nedy), the cynical Hamlet (M. Keyes), the exquisite Ophelia (Annie Malone), the disdainful Beatrice (H. Golden), the dutiful Cordelia (Violet Culliton), the princes in the Tower (M. Moriarty and C. Glavin) acted well their parts. As You Like It, a merry interlude, was the triumph of the evening. It was followed by Richard II and Richard III. The characters were so good that it was hard to decide the prizes. However, \"there's a divinity that shapes our ends,\" and there were three divines. Rev. Fathers Egan, Gleeson and Lowry, to award the prizes, which went to D. Riddell, Vera Carbert, M. Kemp, and B. O'Donnell as the Duke of York. Loretto High School, Engletvood: A Parade! A parade of spirit, motion, colour and music, and behind it all a determination and will as strong as steel . . .S.O.S., Save Our Screen! On Thursday, September 27, Michigan Avenue in Chicago was transformed into a riot of colorful banners proudly displaying the names of over forty parochial high schools and universities, and repre- sentatives from two hundred grammar schools. Seventy thousand young people, each carrying the American flag, were out to convince the people that we mean what we say when we demand \"Reel Decency.\" School after school poured into the start- ing place at Ohio Street, by foot, street-car, \"L,\" bus and car. A whistle . . . silence . . . the parade has be- gun. Left, left, left. Music begins, banners fly, masses of people jam the sidewalk to witness this spirited display. Catholic nurses and boy scouts pre- ceded the schools which followed in alphabetical order. Loretto came in its place. With our Ciscora flag, our school banner and the American flag taking precedence, the students followed, a symphony in navy and white, with trim uniforms and black shoes, blue berets and white gloves. As we pass the reviewing stand, we glimpse States-Attorney, Thomas J.

This was truly a colorful and impressive way of pledging ourselves to the Legion of Decency by which we resolve to observe the Movie Code in which Class A pictures are approved for general patronage. Class B are offensive in parts, and Class C are condemned as wholly offensive. I could write page after page about the project, but I am sure it can all be summed up in the slogans carried by the schools: \"Clean Movies are Keen Movies,\" and \"Save Our Screens.\" Dorothy Shean, Fourth Year. Loretto College : November 20: Fantastic-looking costumes of the l4th century were seen flying around corners in the upper halls. The stage was set for the presen- tation of Chaucer's Prologue to the Canterbury Tales. A h'alf-hour later the would-be l4th century pilgrims entered the dining-room renovated as \"Harry Bailey's Tavern fast by ye Cloistre of Loretto.\" A dinner in true old-fourteenth-century style, even to the roast pigge, was served. After-dinner speeches by the pilgrims eclipsed anything that had been done in like manner prior to this! Wit, humour, laughter found way into the exhilarating speeches. With a fund of quotations, the true view of Chaucer's age was brought out and compared with modern times. Patricia Callen replied to the toast to The Knight; Rita Kohen, as Mine Host, to the Inns in literature; Eleanor Phelan, to the Haberdasher; Catherine Laughlin, to the Merchant; Beatrice Plewes, to the Nun in literature; Sophie Stockwell, to the Shipman; Mar- garet McCue, to the Faire Ladye; Irene Allen, to the Cook in English literature; Lillian McCarthy, to the Ploughman; Pauline Simon, to the Yeoman; Clare Tumpane, to Chaucer; The supper on Bloor Street, promised by Mine Host, to which all con- tributed twopence, was awarded to Lillian McCarthy.

In travelling and observing, the tourist learns to know better those whom he did not know, or even ignored, and on his return he gives them a better name . . . he is a moral ambassador.\" „. v/f ..^ «, . .. ■^Pius XII \"On Tourism\" T WENT TO Europe this summer! Since I was -'■ one of thousands thus privileged, that is hardly headline news. However, not every pleasure-trip becomes a tour, and even better, not every tour, a pilgrimage. But mine did! To be honest with you, when I stepped on the transatlantic steamer that was to take us to Le Havre, I was under the delusion that I was embark- ing on a glorified pleasure-trip. I learned, however, that the experience before me was deeper and broader than that. When I said goodbye to my family at Quebec and went to my stateroom, a dreadful wave of homesickness overtook me, and when the last bit of <Zanadian soil faded into the distance, I thought I had made a great mistake. The Holy Father, with his perfect genius for speaking with astonishing familiarity on every subject, spoke once of the tourist's leaving family, friends, occupation to expose himself to a variety of unforeseen events. The in- explicable impulse, that had prompted me to do so, seemed foolhardy now. Then the excitement of the weeks ahead began to grip me, and that morning, when the twenty of us first saw France drenched in sunlight, we looked at each other, and laughed foolishly, for we realized that we had acquired the common external feature of a tourist, the unmistak- able air of happiness and expectancy. The laying aside of our worries and responsibilities had given us a peace of mind that was to become the priceless staff of our journey. For the first time in our lives per- haps, we twenty were content to rise in the morn- ing filled only with the thoughts of that day, and to fall into bed at night, weary, but grateful, for all the treasured moments of the past twenty-four hours. Ours was the easy way of learning that abandonment to God's Will brought its own reward. But we still had a distance to cover, in miles, and in the wisdom of tourism. Our first stop had been Paris. The weather was glorious, our daily schedules had been planned for maximum enjoy- ment and sight-seeing, our beautiful Grand Hotel faced on the Place de I'Opera, and our meals did credit to the fame of the French cuisine. Despite many people's disappointment in that incomparable city, Paris stole my heart, and it was hard to leave it even for Versailles. With Paris behind, it was not long before we knew what the Holy Father meant when he described a second common feature of tourism: the submitting of oneself, joyfully or sorrowfully, to the greater or lesser discomforts scarcely avoidable even on the best of organized tours. We had the usual insatiable desire to see and do as much as possible, coupled almost at once with the aggravating awareness of our physical limitations. We had more than a nodding acquain- tance with our chief enemy, fatigue. I remember a day spent in the Vatican Museum, that veritable city of artistic treasures, wandering from hall to hall so tired I could hardly distinguish a Raphael from a Michelangelo, simply because I had spent the pre- vious day, pounding the pavements of Rome. I spent one day travelling from Nimes to Nice, so ill from sunstroke that the day's events are only a blur to me. I can recall some people desperately ill from strange cooking. I can name some who were weak from the excessive heat of Italy, and depressed by steady rains of England. The day of the dedi- cation of the Basilica of St. Therese at Lisieux, we were enveloped and squeezed into a crowd that seemed to comprise half the world. And yet I can- not recall anyone complaining. We were thrilled just be be there. One fastidious lady smiled sweetly as the girl in a small cafe served her five courses on one plate. Our reaction to all these trying cir- cumstances convinced us that there must be a special grace for tourists, and extra energy on which he can, and does, draw. Trials such as these, which at home would have made us highly irate, assumed here their truer proportion of near-insignificance. The final feature which all tourists have in com- mon is their contact with different traditions, customs, convictions and prejudices. Here the casual traveller stands distinguished from his fellow tourist who delights in the changes, and soon learns to draw valuable lessons from them. We grew to love our continental breakfasts, and the wine of the other meals. The starched lace bonnets of the Norman women charmed us. We tired of putting on sweaters in 90-degree heat when entering churches in Italy, yet at the same time, we respected the finer sense 23 of modesty of these people. The deafening noise of the horns in Paris traffic amused us. While the tipping in the large cities seemed frequent, it actually was smaller in amount than at home. We were impressed with the common fluency in lan- guages, and the old-world courtesy and graciousness that was extended to us everywhere. We loved the peculiarly Catholic custom of brides' veils left at Our Lady's altars, and the genuflections of all the faithful in the streets outside their churches. In short, we saw the customs of other people at first-hand, and better understood that ours is not the only way of doing things. In recompense for the inconvenience of growing into full-fledged tourist, we garnered a daily store of treasures. To see ancient ruins like the Colosseum, to walk through the palace of Versailles, to examine the Medici chapels in Florence, to stand in St. Mark's Square in Venice, and above all, to see and pray in the unbelievedly magnificent cathedrals of Notre Dame in Paris and Chartres, St. Peter's in Rome, the Cathedrals of Milan, Cologne and West- minster, to see before my very eyes these places that till then had been subjects of study and places on a map was one of the greatest joys of my life. The sight of the still war-torn towns in nor- thern France and Germany, of the countless soldiers' graves along the country roads, and the numberless women dressed in black, looking far older than their years, is a silent reminder of the sufll^erings we cannot begin to appreciate; it is much easier to understand their problems of rehabilitation after seeing so many places where the war hardly seems finished. There was the glow of friendship that welled within each of us for the Belgian who had tears in his eyes when he spoke of his gratitude for Canada's help in the last war. Thus it was as tourists that we learned to see, in strange surroundings, our Creator; the grandeur of the Alps, the peacefulness of the Pyrenees, the bril- liance of the Mediterranean coastline, the majesty of the Black Forest, and the image of Christ in the people themselves gave us a deeper insight into the infinity of God. With this insight, the tourists became pilgrims. It is the pilgrim who sets out to see God in all his travels, and inevitably directs his steps to the heart of Christianity, the Eternal City, to the feet of the Holy Father. To my dying day I shall never forget standing in St. Peter's Square under a blazing noon-day sun, looking in breathless anticipation to- wards a second-story window, kneeling in the Square a moment later to receive the blessing from the Vicar of Christ, and the tears that could not be checked when the window closed again. Those moving moments gave a deeper, truer meaning to our tour; they made it a pilgrimage. So did an evening in Lourdes, when, under a starlit sky, at the end of the traditional candlelight procession, we stood with thousands of all nationalities and tongues, and turning toward the floodlit basilica sang with one voice \"Credo in unum Deum.\" We pilgrims understood then, that we were enacting on a small scale the whole plan and purpose of our life: we are all \"pilgrims towards eternity.\" Arden Spence Caen, Lisieux and Tours. .... today has been as crowded and exciting as all the other days of this wonderful pilgrimage. The telephone in my room in the spanking-new hotel woke, me at 5.30 a.m.! I got up, dressed, and was ju^t going out the door to Mass, when the man came by for the luggage. As my things were strewn all over the room, I had to return to pack, and thus made myself late. The others had gone, and I didn't know to which church. I went to the ruined church, previously pointed out to us as the sole surviving building of an air-raid. But when I found that it was locked, I went seeking another. Fortunately I met Mr. Brown (our tour-guide whom most other people called Charles by now!). He took me to the others in a little convent on a side street with an unprepossessing entrance. I could never have found it alone. The tiny chapel was beautiful with lilies. The prie-dieus were covered with ancient petit-point, designed with crosses and flowers. Father McHenry said Mass, and we re- turned to the hotel for breakfast, and left shortly after for Lisieux. The countryside is very beautiful here, not unlike that of Ontario. The trees are not as tall and majestic on the whole, and they have dark blotches of mistletoe. By the side of the road, and encircling golden wheatfields, grow wild flowers of white, yellow, blue and mauve, splashed with brilliant red poppies. When we arrived at Lisieux, the home of the Little Flower, the whole place was on tiptoe in anticipa- tion of the dedication of the great new basilica in her honour. As the twenty-two of us walked up the hill to its steps where the Mass of Dedication was to be said, I stopped for a moment. The crowd was so large that it would have filled three basilicas, and out here at least, there could be some attempt at accomodating it. A group of men and women from Brittany passed by in their native costumes. The black dresses and shawls of the women contrasted with the fancy white aprons, and high stiffened-lace head-dresses. The men with their old-fashioned suits and funny brimmed hats were dressed as all pilgrims used to be when their garb gave them safe journey across Europe. (Continued on page 48) 24 This universal gatliering of Sodalists paid homage to the Immaculate Virgin, com- memorated the sixtieth anniversary of Pius XII as a Sodalist, and inaugurated a new era in Sodality history \"TT IS A GREAT JOY to greet tonight, on their -■- arrival, the thousands of Sodalists gathered in Rome for the first session of their World Federation. May Mary Immaculate, the feast of whose birthday the Church is celebrating today, be propitious to you all.\" Coming in from his summer home for the occa- sion, the Holy Father, with these words, opened the Sodality World Congress for the 15,000 Sodalists from sixty-two nations. While these Sodalists celebrated in this pilgrim- age the centenary of the Immaculate Conception dogma, the Roman visit was at the request of the Holy Father himself, since he wished the Sodality to form a world federation, for which he approved and recommended the statutes. Its first Congress was to coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of his con- secration in the Sodality. And on that first evening, the delegates knelt before the Holy Father's throne in St. Peter's to present him with gifts and prayers commemorating his enrollment in their ranks. Next day saw the election, for five years, of the members of the Executive Council: the President, Prefect, Secretary, Treasurer and four Consulters. The voting-power lay with the delegation from each country, consisting of two Directors and three 25 Sodalists. If the Sodalities of a country exceeded 3,000 that country might add a Director and Sodalist for every thousand. Both United States and Spain fall into this latter category. This Executive Coun- cil will meet every year, and inform all the feder- ations of its activity. The Canadian delegation, the Rev. Ludger Brien, the Rev. Douglas Daly, S.J., Mr. Lucien Gauvin and Miss Josette Beaubien, both of Montreal, and Mr. John Buckley of Halifax, was accompanied by some thirty observers, among whom were Rev. Gerald Gallagher, S.J. with twenty-five Sodalists from St. Mary's University. Mr. Gauvin, in the later voting, became a Consultor. It is interesting to note that, since the archdiocese of Montreal has the only Sodality federation in Canada, it alone was empowered to send a dele- gation to Rome. It is characteristic of Father Brien that he invited the English-speaking Sodalities to share his privilege. In the new President, Dr. Jose Inigo Lasaga, a professor of psychology at University of Havana, the Sodalists could not have made a more fortunate choice. In his Spanish background, he is a citizen of the old world; by his education at Harvard and Laval, he knows the tempo of the new; well-versed in languages, having a speaking knowledge of four, and a reading knowledge of three, he is the univer- salist, as becomes a Sodalist. The Holy Father's recognition of the need of this broad outlook is evidenced in his appointment of the new Director of the World Federation. His Excellency, Joseph Gawlina, Bishop of the Polish people in exile, and Titular Archbishop of Madytus in \"Turkey, a Sodalist since 1914, is a man of many talents, many languages, of worldwide travels and experiences. The days following the election of the Council were devoted to discussion of the theme proposed for the Congress: a wiser selection of candidates, a closer union with the hierarchy, and a greater mutual cooperation with the other apostolic bodies. These, of course, are the main points laid down in Bis Saccular i of 1948, to which the Holy Father has given a solemn character to underline its importance. However, on this occasion. His Holiness insists again that \"the Sodalities are not mere devotional associations, but schools of perfection and apostolate. They are intended for those who are not satisfied with doing a little more than necessary, but for those who are determined to answer the call of Christ generously. This is why no one may be admitted on a mere tradition, or that they may re- ceive from admission, esteem and dignity. The sole consideration is their desire for a greater perfection of Christian life, radiating both personal and apos- tolic fervour.\" This ideal, which the Holy Father calls both astere and attractive, is not for the good, but for the better. The touchstone of the Sodalist's zeal is found in his union with the hierarchy. The Sodalist accord- ing to the Pope's heart wishes only to serve, and that not independently, but wherever the hierarchy wants him. Only a serious formation, of course, will give him the humility and obedience, devotedness and abnegation necessary for such a disposition. The Holy Father receives an enthusiastic welcome as he enters St. Peter's for the opening of the Sodality Congress 26 The Canadian Delegation at the World Sodality Congress: Mr. John Buckley, Rev. Douglas Daly, S.J., Miss Josette Beaubien, Rev. Roger Brien, and Mr. Lucien Gauvin After evening prayers in St. Mary Major on Friday evening, the thousands of Sodalists marched in a torchlight procession to the Colisseum to offer the outdoor Stations of the Cross for the Church in Silence. A delegate from each of the fourteen Iron Curtain countries represented at the Congress took up his position at each Station. An equally touching demonstration of faith was that of the laying of the floral tribute from each Sodality nation at the foot of the column of the Im- maculate in the Piazza di Spagna. Here at the begin- ning of the Marian Year, Pius XII placed the bouquet of orchids flown from Quadelupe. Here at the con- clusion of their Congress, Sodalists recited an act of homage to their Queen. The Sodalists left Rome comforted and encouraged by the Holy Father's closing words to them, and to all the Sodalist com- panions whom they represented. He wished the Congress to inspire them with the memory of Pente- cost, and the perfect harmony and charity won there by Mary's mighty intercession, an intercession no less mighty now before the apparently insurmount- able obstacles of these critical times. The Reverend Douglas Daly, S.J. Living Monuments 'Stay close to Jesus and His Mother and imitate both to save yourselves.** (Holy Father in his Marian Year Address to Children) A RCHBISHOP Traglia, in his directive last Fall -^ *- on the fitting celebration of the Marian Year, hoped that when these months of Mary had passed, there would remain \"the living monument\" to it in the lives of the faithful. The Day of Mary Activity is the successful attempt on the part of the Catholic Puppet Craft Guild to form young boys and girls into the living monuments of Marian apostles. On the Day of Mary, once a week or more, the children keep track of their good deeds, and make an offering of them to Mary. The group of catechetical teachers in the Guild employs the sound pedagogical method that concrete reality, sensible and especially visible things, capture the attention. The senses play a vital role in our lives. Christ's bestowal of invisible grace through the visible Sacraments is only one of the many ways in which the Church recognizes this. The words chosen by the Holy Father in his Marian Year prayer: \"O crystal fountain of faith, bathe our minds with the eternal truths . . .\", \"captivate our hearts with your heavenly perfume . . .\", all these words clothe for us the abstract. In the same way the imitation of Mary through the Day of Mary comes alive with puppets, and with leaflets, which contain a few deep truths to think over, a short prayer, and a suggested virtue to practice. These leaflets, both beautifully and imaginatively designed, have a detachable part, the virtue slips, on which seniors put check marks of virtue practiced, juniors, pictures of their good deeds, before placing them in the Gift Box to Our Lady. Through their Leadership Courses the Puppet Craft Guild provides a wonderful opportunity for junior promoters of the ages of 13-15 to spread the Day of Mary. They are trained and formed in how they can accomplish many things for small children by puppet-acting, drawing and so on. Dr. Ida Peterfy and Miss Agnes Raday of 831 Bloor Street West had two such courses recently. The Loretto schools of St. Charles, St. Edward's, St. Gabriel's, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, St. Monica's, St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Margaret's are among those participating in these Fall courses. Holy Family, Blessed Sacrament and St. Anthony's began their Days of Mary last Spring. 27 Marilyn and her famous coach Gus Ryder sign the guest-book at Loretto College School. Of Mr. Ryder, well-known for his work with crippled children, Marilyn said: \"For the swim, he was the head, I was the body.\" MARILYN September 9. Dear Diary, I'm almost too excited and too tired to write. From the time I arrived at school this morning until 8.55 tonight, I have thought of no one but Marilyn. Yes, Marilyn Bell. She is in my very room at school. But today while we, her classmates, were at lessons, Marilyn was swimming Lake Ontario. We were kept posted on her progress. But if our minds were not always on lessons, who could blame us.^ If two sides of a triangle ... I wonder how far she is now ... are respectively equal to . . . what if she's given up! With the whole city in a frenzy of excitement, we, who knew her, found the suspense hard to bear. Even the teachers showed signs of — well, let's say, excitement ! Five minutes after school dismissed found us well on our way to the Canadian National Exhibition, where Marilyn was to finish her gruelling swim between three and four o'clock. I ran all the way from the streetcar to the lakeshore because I wanted to be there at the crowning moment when she stepped out of the water. It was lucky I did run, for she arrived only six hours after I did. I slipped my rosary through my fingers an infinite number of times. The prayers of thousands were answered. Blown off course, she touched the breakwater at 8.55 p.m. at Sunnyside instead of at the C.N.E., where we were waiting. We were disappointed that we didn't see her, but the main thing was she made it. As she touched the breakwater, rockets burst into the air and everyone cheered. I guess they were Marilyn Bell, sixteen-year-old, five-foot, one-inch schoolgirl captured the heart of the nation when she became the first person in history to swinn the thirty-two-mile Lake Ontario. To the fortitude of those twenty-one hours she has joined, in the triumphal days since, selflessness, modesty and graciousness. hoping Marilyn could hear them. When drowsy and exhausted Marilyn was pulled from the water she is supposed to have said, \"Is everyone crazy or am I?\" \"That, dear diary, was just how I felt. September 10th. Dear Diary, Tonight is the night after! Tonight I am much better at thinking, and I have thought a lot about Marilyn's feat. Although her rise to fame is sudden, her preparation for it has been long. She has taught me the great lesson of perseverance. She showed it in her magnificent swim, especially at one time when she became very weak. It would have been very easy to climb back in the boat and call it all off. But Marilyn kept going at a time when keep- ing going seemed the hardest thing in the world to do. She could only do this as a result of long practice, strict adherance to training rules and many acts of self-denial. After the battle well fought there is always the reward. Tonight Marilyn was given a reception at the C.N.E. Bandshell, where she received a check for $10,000 and heard \"Marilyn,\" a song composed for her by Dr. Leslie Bell, and sung by his choral group. Afterwards she met Dale Evans and Roy Rogers at the grand- stand. Exhibition Park. During her swim, you know, 28 Diary, he interrupted his show and had the people pray for Marilyn. That was nice, wasn't it? I thought the Cardinal's wire of congratulations was just beautiful. In it he describes Marilyn as the \"Lady of the Lake,\" a phrase immediately adopted by reporters and now familiar to everyone. To- night's paper describes Marilyn as \"Canada's hap- piest schoolgirl.\" Naturally she is, but her class- mates run a close second. September 13th Dear Diary, You should have seen Bay Street! You should have seen Marilyn! You should have seen us! As she drove up, she was plainly surprised to see some thirty-five or more uniformed figures standing in the drizzling rain, smiling broadly at her. Janine Adamcyk, our class president, presented her with a blue and white lei. Blue and white for our school, you know. Marilyn went into city hall and added her name to the guest book, signed by many famous visitors before her. We formed a guard of honour on the steps, and as she came out, we cheered wildly. She walked to her car smiling through stubborn tears. Then seated on the back of a white conver- tible, with her wonderful coach, Gus Ryder, she rode back down Bay Street through a cloud of ticker tape. As I watched her the sharp contrast between - this scene and the everyday scene in the classroom shot through my mind: another Marilyn, the quiet, unassuming girl of the classroom. Apart from her good grades, she always had a special something Marilyn's schoolmates, Janine Adamcyk and Teresa de Cristofaro hug her enthusiastically after presenting her with a lei of blue and white mums which set her apart. She had the will to learn and the enterprise to put forth her best efforts in every- thing she attempted. She took singing lessons and belonged to the school choir. But she did all this simply, in the sheltered atmosphere of her school. Gaily laughing, Marilyn walks between congratulating school friends following the Civic Recep- tion at the City Hall, as Insp. Robert Davie holds the car door open for her. Following her are Mayor Saunders and Gus Ryder THE CASE OF THE COFFEE By MARILYN BELL. XII npHERE were many little incidents in connection ■^ with the Lake Ontario swim that I wasn't even aware of until afterwards. Take the case of the coffee, for example. When Florence Chadwick announced that she was starting her swim in just an hour and a half, the Mona IV changed from a place of rest and relaxation to a scene of hustle and bustle. Two of the reporters and my navigator volunteered to make coffee for those in my open guide boat. To keep the coffee hot, they decided to put it in a large thermos. That presented the problem of gauging the proper amount of water to use. They ended up by measuring it, cup by cup, into the thermos, and allowing two teaspoonsful of sugar for each cup. Once the race had started, everyone in the guide boat was too busy trying to get me to Toronto to bother with the coffee. Later, when it was needed, the three coffee-makers produced the cups and the thermos: thirty-two cups of water, sixty- four tea- spoonfuls of sugar, sufficient cream, but no coffee! It was a case of \"water, water everywhere, and coffee on the sink.\" Here she rode in glaring limelight. Yet I know that our Marilyn is in heart the same. Neither she nor her ideals have changed. Dear Diary, September I4th. I see from the papers — it was really quite ex- citing to see Loretto nuns in the Star — that Marilyn and Gus Ryder paid a surprise visit to the school after the civic reception yesterday. We were all down- town, but she wanted to see her teachers anyway. Mother St. Gertrude sang \"Marilyn\" for her and Marilyn sang, too. The quiet halls must have been fairly bursting with reporters and flash bulbs ! Dear Diary, September 22nd. Guess what? Today Marilyn came back to school. On arriving at school today, I sensed that something was wrong. The halls, usually filled with girls gathered around lockers at that time, were deserted. They were all in our classroom, dear diary! Yes, truly, Marilyn was back! When I think back on the whole week I realize that this is not just a return to school but a return to a way of life away from the spotlight. There were times when we all won- dered if she would be back. Newspaper stories did much to increase our doubts when the headlines proclaimed: \"Hollywood Lures Marilyn, No More School For Lear.\" In one article a reporter said \"a theatre man hung around hoping for a chance to tell a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl how she could pick up $50,000.\" Yet, here she is! At a time when we need a proper example in public life, Marilyn came along. She did not disappoint us. Her speech and her manner has been above reproach. The com- pliments she has received on her charm and natural- ness reflect on her family and on her school. The influence of both has instilled in her a proper sense of values, rare in our present-day world. Marion Nugent, XII The Fonr Plads Meet The Fonr Lads Today the improbable happened! On Friday Mother Yvonne told the \"Four Plads\" to bring their outfits to school today. The reason.^ Even we didn't know. At three o'clock with our plaid jackets and black skirts on, we were ushered into the music- room with the utmost secrecy. Though there were a number of people in the room, we recognized in a flash Toronto's own \"Four Lads.\" They were in the city from New York, and had come to meet Marilyn and present her with two beautiful orchids and a gold St. Christopher medal and chain, their names inscribed on the back of the medal. We discovered later that Marilyn in her thoughtfulness had wished to share this happy moment with the four girls to whom it would mean most. For two years we have entertained at various functions by pantomiming the songs of these same four boys. We never dreamed that one day they would be our audience, and we, their entertainers. We did a few of their records for the nuns, the boys and Marilyn. Then, in turn, the boys sang for us. All too soon they had to leave, but we will long remember our meeting, and the girl who made it possible.

On the way home, he stopped in England, where he is at present on a three-month tour for Sodality work. Mother Ignatius, I.B.V.M. sent the minutes of Father's first conference for teachers held at our St. Mary's Convent, Hampstead, at which Reverend B. Bassett, S.J. introduced Father. The scope of his conference was the training and admis- sion of Sodality candidates, but Mother Ignatius ad- mits that because Father was so vital, it was difficult to cover the agenda in the minutes! \"You cannot work with the mass; you can only help the mass through the small group.\" Hence the necessity of training the Sodalist well and at length, first in per- sonal holiness, then in the \"social holiness\" of the apostolate. Only by a serious effort to perform all the spiritual exercises of Rule Thirty-Four as well as by an attitude of mind, constantly apostolic, can a Sodalist hope to be admitted. Through such mem- bers only can a Sodality raise the tone of its envir- onment, a function implied in its First Rule. Father Sommer's first talk in England was at Stoneyhurst; his last will be at a rally on December 8 at Farm Street, following an evening at 6.30 with a sermon for old-pupil Sodalists. Father Hooney in Weilami Notre Dame Sodality, Welland was host on September 26 to a Sodality Day, organized by Rev. Kenneth Burns, C.S.C. and conducted by Rev. Richard Rooney, SJ. of \"The Queen's Work\".

Upon investigation we find that this statement is true. Furthermore, we find the clique is composed of faithful members who are present at every meet- ing, who accept appointments to committees, who give willingly of their time, energies and efforts, and who sincerely believe the more one puts into one's organizations, the more one will get out of it. There is no question that the enthusiasm, respon- sibility and efforts of these members are of inestim- able value to your class. And we would, therefore, suggest that you join this clique. It is not a difficult matter to do so — in fact, it is easy. Begin by attending meetings regularly; volunteer to do some- thing; take a more lively and active interest in class activities; make helpful, constructive sugges- tions, and accept responsibilities to serve on com- mittees. Show a continual interest in all affairs per- taining to your school. Before you realize it, you will be a member of the clique. You will be sur- prised to know how anxious \"they\" are to have 'you\" on the inside.
