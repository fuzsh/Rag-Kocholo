        "text": "ABSTRACT An accident as old as humanity, shipwreck involves a wide range of metaphors that fuse familiarity and exoticism, allegory and specificity, providence and godless catastrophe. In exploring Cervantes’s approach to this topos, this study identifies how the metaphor conveys an incisive political commentary in Don Quixote, a literary and spiritual reflection in Persiles, and a troubling self-projection in Journey to Parnassus. Unveiling the continuities of Cervantes’s use of this motif provides intriguing insights into the experiential fractures and literary exploits of the author as he embarked on the difficult journeys of his last works and years (1614–1616).\n\nThe Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor is subjected to a new sociological evaluation in light of the theories concerning rites of passage. Included therein are an analysis of its elaborate structure and how it relates to the rite of passage. The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor remains one of the most important literary works of Middle Kingdom Egypt. The tale has been found only on a single manuscript which dates back to the early Twelfth Dynasty. The provenience of the manuscript is unknown, and the original can currently be found at the Hermitage Museum (P. St.-Petersburg1115). The different linguistic, geographical, religious, and stylistic aspects of the tale have been studied by different scholars. The tale has been described as a folk tale, but it also alludes to a more esoteric knowledge which was limited to small literate group of elites. As a folk tale, its repetition and the use of simple structure are its most prominent features. The tale also has a very sophisticated structure with an elaborate pattern of a tale within a tale and shows the esoteric knowledge of the person who composed it. The tale’s relationship to the rite of passage has been less extensively studied; even though the whole journey of the sailor from the moment of departing Egypt until he comes back safely to Egypt alludes to these rites. The aim of this paper is to relate the different stages of the journey of the Shipwrecked Sailor to the rite of passage.\n\nThis thesis focuses on Byzantine sailors in the Middle Byzantine Period (c. 642 CE–1204 CE) in the Eastern Mediterranean by drawing a general picture of the sailors’ daily lives. In so doing, I argue that the experience of being a Byzantine sailor was multifaceted and complex. To gain insight into this variety of experiences, this thesis relies on the interdisciplinary study of textual, archaeological, and ethnographic sources from the Middle Byzantine Period and beyond, based on the longue durée characteristics of seafaring and interacting with maritime landscapes. These experiences are the result of the commonalities of living in the maritime landscape and interacting with this landscape through seafaring. Maritime travel covered various distances (day-long, regional, long-distance) through different types of sailing patterns (cabotage, tramping, and direct), form the framework for travelling in the seascape. To better understand the movement of the sailor, I introduce two concepts: emplacement (sailors belonged to their local maritime communities and cultures) and displacement (sailors journeyed away from this community). On this journey, the sailor stopped at two different types of ports: short-distance ports which served those who moved within micro-regions, and ports connected to long-distance trade which provided certain establishments, such as taverns, inns, and brothels, for the sailors and were central to a sailor’s experience at the port. Some sailors, such as the crew of the eleventh-century Serçe Limanı shipwreck, moved outside the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire, and had to mediate linguistic, political, religious, and economic differences. Moreover, the daily experience on board the ship during journeys was regulated through laws, customs, and practices which governed the sailors’ behaviours, bodies, and souls. By discussing the daily lives of Byzantine sailors, this thesis contributes to the wider scholarship regarding Byzantine society and experiences, and by employing a variety of sources in an interdisciplinary manner, gives voice to a group who otherwise would remain silent.\n\n'The Husband’s Message' is the monologue of a messenger conveying a lord’s love message to his wife. The literal meaning of the poem seems to be, at first glance, quite clear; however, the presence of some runes and an unexpected division into three sections require more attention. The aim of the present article is to investigate these peculiar aspects according to the methodology of Material Philology in particular. The analysis of the context of the Exeter Book and of the graphic cues characterizing the poem enables us to suggest a possible function for the tripartite layout of the text and to clarify the meaning of the runic message at the end. Moreover, the relation between 'The Husband’s Message' and the closest poems in the codex can shed new light on the meaning of the text revealing a possible, further allegorical level of interpretation. This perspective is also supported by textual analysis: various elements appear to be related to biblical symbols and seem to suggest that the sea journey described in 'The Husband’s Message' could be construed allegorically as the process of conversion every Christian should undergo in order to gain eternal salvation."
