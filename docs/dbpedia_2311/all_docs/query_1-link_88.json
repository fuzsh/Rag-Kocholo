        "text": "And speaking of destroyers, here comes the first of three entries concerning British destroyers, starting with the ones built in and around the Great War who had members of their class survive to serve in the Second World War.\n\nYou'll probably notice the considerable leap in places when it comes to pennant numbers in this group. This is because this particular list evolved in two stages. The first stage was to involve all destroyers who actually served or would serve in World War Two; on the main destroyer hull number list, they go from D00 (HMS Valorous of the Valentine-class [Admiralty V-class flotilla leaders], AKA Edana Mack) to D500 (HMS Trincomalee of the Barfleur-class [Battle-class] destroyers, AKA Estelle Hughes). However, since I was also including lists of Great War-era capital ships, I decided to expand the British destroyer list to include ALL destroyers of those classes who had representatives fight in World War Two even if they were lost in World War One or scrapped in the interwar period.\n\nI managed to spread around a lot of these girls to cover from the Bahamas to Canada to Australia and New Zealand, plus India and Pakistan, through Egypt and Lebanon, plus Greece and Cyprus and to Finland as well. Japan is marked here with the one Simoom-class (Admiralty S-class) destroyer which was captured in World War Two; this allowed Singapore to get on this list. Thailand is also here as there is one Rosalind-class (Thornycroft R-class) ship which was transferred to that kingdom post-World War One and may still exist as a training hulk to this day; this allowed me to pass some more over to that kingdom. Ireland is the big winner here due to the replication of names in the various classes to appear in either wartime destroyers or wartime submarines of various lettered classes; their names are normally the Irish Gaelic translation of their original ship name.\n\nYou'll all note the use of actual ship names to identify classes. I'm fully aware that Britain preferred letter codes to identify classes, but I changed it to the accepted international standard of the first ship of the class providing the class name. Of course, their standard Royal Navy class designations are also noted.\n\nYou all know the drill!\n\nKANTAI COLLECTION/AZUR LANE/WARSHIP GIRLS\n\nLIST OF GREAT WAR DESTROYERS (ROYAL NAVY)\n\nNo./Ship

the Republic of Korea, which mixes a good load of Japanese and American types.\n\nAgain, as with other navies using the American-style hull classification codes, Korean native terms are substituted in. Note that the Korean terms Kuch'uk'am and Kuch'uk'ouiham are actually written in han'gŭl as 구축함 and 구축호위함 respectively; an \"h\" in the initial syllable position goes silent when it follows a \"k\" sound at the final syllable position.\n\nAs I've always done, Korean words are rendered in the McCune-Reischauer Romanization system; I never cared at all for the \"revised\" system introduced in the ROK in 2002 since, IMO, it does NOT properly render certain sounds the right way when put to Latin script.\n\nYou all know the drill!\n\nKANTAI COLLECTION/AZUR LANE/WARSHIP GIRLS\n\nLIST OF KOREAN
