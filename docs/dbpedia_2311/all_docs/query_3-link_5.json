        "text": "née Kennedy. Born October 9, 1890 Ingersoll, Ontario. Died September 27, 1944, Oakland California, U.S.A. Her mother volunteered with the Salvation Army and Aimee would gather a congregation of her dolls to give a sermon. As a teen she wrote to the Canadian newspaper, Family Herald and Weekly Star, questioning why taxpayer-funded public schools had courses, such as evolution, which undermined Christianity. In 1907 she met Robert Semple and converted to being a Pentecostal and began a life long crusade against the concept of evolution. They Married April 12, 1908 and soon moved to Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. where joining the Full Gospel Assembly and Aimee soon learned of her ability to preach. She was an evangelist. The couple both contracted malaria in China while on tour and Robert died in Hong Kong shortly after the birth of their daughter. On the ship sailing back to America Aimee held Sunday School classed and held services with almost all passengers attending. Back home she worked once again with the Salvation Army. While in New York City she met Harold Stewart McPherson and they married May 5, 1912 settling in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.A. The couple had one son. She felt she had the calling to preach and in 1915 she took the children her husband. She invited him a few months later to join her in her evangelism. After several successful revival tent tours in 1917 she started her own magazine Bridal Call, boosting Pentecostalism into an ongoing American Religious presence. The following year her faith healings became part of the attraction to crowds attending her events. Moving to Los Angeles where her followers built her family a home. Crowds soared in numbers to over 500,000 people by 1921. By 1921 she was divorced. She opened, in the U.S.A., the Angelus Temple of the Four Square Gospel for 1.25 million dollars! That was a lot of money in 1918! In her day, she was the most publicized revivalist in the world. She was a pioneer in the use of modern media using weekly radio to present her faith leading to form one of the 1st mega churches in North America. In 1926 her reported kidnapping and escape caused a frenzy in the national media. She wrote several books about her teachings and her faith and in 1927 she published In the Service of the King: The Story of My Life. During World War ll the Temple became a visible symbol of home front sacrifice for the war effort. with the building used as an air raid shelter. On September 26, 1944 her son found her in her hotel rook unconscious with pills and a bottle of capsules half empty nearby. The verdict was accidental overdose. Her son Rolf McPerson would lead Foursquare Gospel Church for the next 44 years. In 2012 a Broadway musical was produced called; Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee McPherson is one of numerous plays, many of which were loosely based on her life, which have been written over the years.
