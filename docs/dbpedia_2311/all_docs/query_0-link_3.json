        "text": "Career\n\nShe arrived in Toronto, Canada in 1847 at the invitation of Bishop Michael Power. As superior, she oversaw the work of the sisters in both the publicly funded separate schools and private convent schools. Thirteen establishments opened under her watch, including Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School in Toronto and the first in the United States in Joliet, Illinois.\n\nDease\"s ability to work with separate schools boards allowed the growth of publicly funded Catholic education in the province and the expansion of the order across North America.\n\nDease is buried at the former Loretto convent in Niagara Falls, Ontario."
