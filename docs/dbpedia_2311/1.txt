[31] When Gardiner was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in 1848 the Master General of the Ordnance was appalled and referred to him as “a silly vain man”. Hew Strachan: “From Waterloo to Balaclava”, quoted by Tito Benady in Gibraltar Heritage Journal No 6.

[32] Letters of Mother Teresa Ball – to Mother Alphonsus, 11th August 1860. Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes, grown east of Gibraltar around San Lucar de Barrameda and Manilva, were brought to wine presses in Gibraltar. One was situated in Pitman’s Alley until the late 1800s. Whether Mother Teresa means a poor ‘vintage’ or a poor harvest in general, the result might have meant fewer Spanish boarders from Jerez for the school in Europa which was, of course, the nuns’ main source of income.

13: Putting Things Right

[71] Sources are rather vague about its location, but it seems St Francis Xavier’s had to move twice (to Church Street and then to Waterport Street) before they finally settled in 1888.

[74] When the “Bedenham” blew up over sixty years later the ceilings of this building were damaged, and the old cane and plaster showed through. The whole building (now large flats) has been refurbished and so little remains of the original 1882 features.

14: Gavino’s Passage, Cornwall’s Lane

[75] The grotto still exists and continues to be very well looked after since it was first put there by the Loreto Sisters.

[76] One of the nuns from Spain joined the Gibraltar Communities for the purpose.

[81] Giuseppe Codali supervised the cooking arrangements for the survivors at a camp set up outside Landport Gate. The Army provided bell tents, blankets, eating utensils, writing materials. A number of business firms and individuals in Gibraltar provided food, beer, coffee, cigars and a cash advance. [Information from the Codali family].

[82] Confusingly the IBVM in England are called the ‘Roman Branch’ because they had their Generalate in Rome. Nowadays Loreto, the ‘Irish Branch’, also has its Generalate in Rome – right opposite that of the ‘Romans’!

[83] Excellent Inspection results are mentioned several times in the Loreto (Gibraltar) Annals.

[90] The Loreto nuns have had their own vault since 1887. They made space in it for several other people, among them two Sisters of Charity, a music teacher, the Bishop’s coach-driver and a cook. Sometimes the vault could not be opened because a recent burial had taken place so the nuns were occasionally offered space in other people’s vaults. The Loreto nuns who died in Gibraltar before 1887 were certainly among that number.

[101] The cobbles in the principal streets had been removed over a hundred years earlier during the Great Siege in order to allow enemy cannon balls to sink into the soft earth rather than ricochet off them and cause greater damage to buildings. The removal of the cobbles meant that the streets were inclined to be muddy and so were boarded over until, with the advent of the motor car, they were surfaced with Tar Macadam.

20: Progress And Modernisation

[104] Girls who attended “the Green Convent” in the 1950s (Loreto High at Convent Place, so called because of its green uniform) will remember all the rules about the making of the new uniform. The darts at the front were to be exactly six inches apart, the ‘divided skirts’ for games had to be one inch above the knee, and the hem of the tunic must touch the ground when you kneeled.

[105] The first lines of the film’s theme song are:

“¡María de la O!

Que desgrasiaíta, gitana, tú ere

teniéndolo tó.

Te quiere reí,

y hasta los ojitos los tienes morao

de tanto sufrí.”
