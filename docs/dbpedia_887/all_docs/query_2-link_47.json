        "text": "A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In everyday U.S. usage, however, \"grocery store\" is synonymous with supermarket, and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries.\n\nPlatform may refer to:\n\nA shopping mall is a North American term for a large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department stores. The term \"mall\" originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it, but in the late 1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping centers that were becoming commonplace at the time. In the U.K., such complexes are considered shopping centres, though \"shopping center\" covers many more sizes and types of centers than the North American \"mall\". Other countries may follow U.S. usage and others follow U.K. usage. In Canadian English, and oftentimes in Australia and New Zealand, 'mall' may be used informally but 'shopping centre' or merely 'centre' will feature in the name of the complex. The term 'mall' is less-commonly a part of the name of the complex.\n\nPoza Rica, formally: Poza Rica de Hidalgo is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz.

This has resulted in the decline of oil well exploration and drilling activities, though there are still many oil facilities.\n\nSesame oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from sesame seeds. The oil is one of the earliest-known crop-based oils. Worldwide mass modern production is limited due to the inefficient manual harvesting process required to extract the oil.

Oil made from toasted seeds is used for its distinctive nutty aroma and taste, although it may be unsuitable for frying, which makes it taste burnt and bitter.\n\nOmišalj is a coastal municipality in the north-west of the island of Krk in Croatia.
