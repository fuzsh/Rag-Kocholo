        "text": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Jadranski naftovod d.d's (ZGSE:JNAF) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.6% over the past week. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Jadranski naftovod d.d is:\n\n8.0% = €56m ÷ €699m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every €1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn €0.08 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nJadranski naftovod d.d's Earnings Growth And 8.0% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Jadranski naftovod d.d's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 16%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Accordingly, Jadranski naftovod d.d's low net income growth of 3.5% over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Jadranski naftovod d.d's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to , relative to its industry.\n\nIs Jadranski naftovod d.d Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nDespite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 29% (or a retention ratio of 71% over the past three years, Jadranski naftovod d.d has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nAdditionally, Jadranski naftovod d.d has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Jadranski naftovod d.d can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Wrapping up, we would proceed with caution with this company and one way of doing that would be to look at the risk profile of the business.
