        "text": "NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS) (the “Partnership” or “NS”) and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NYSE: NSH) (“NSH”) today announced a definitive agreement that would result in the merger of NSH with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership through a unit-for-unit exchange. The merger would result in NSH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership and the cancellation of the 2% economic general partner interest in the Partnership, the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership and approximately 10.2 million Partnership common units currently owned by NSH and its subsidiaries.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005429/en/\n\nUnder the terms of the definitive agreement, NSH unitholders would receive 0.55 of a Partnership common unit in exchange for each NSH unit they own at closing, representing a premium of approximately 1.7% based on the closing prices of the Partnership’s common units and of NSH’s units on February 7, 2018. The transaction would result in approximately 23.6 million additional common units being issued by the Partnership. In connection with this transaction, William E. Greehey, the Chairman of the Board of both NSH and the Partnership, who controls approximately 21% of the outstanding NSH units, has executed a support agreement pursuant to which he has agreed to vote the NSH units controlled by him in favor of the merger.\n\n“After much discussion and deliberation, the NS and NSH Boards reached an agreement to simplify in a way that we believe will allow us to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities and to best manage our business over the long term,” said Brad Barron, president and chief executive officer of the Partnership and NSH. “Simplifying our corporate structure and eliminating incentive distribution rights will lower our cost of capital and create a more efficient and transparent structure.”\n\nBoard Chairman Bill Greehey agreed. “While my decision to support the simplification and reset was difficult, I firmly believe it was the right decision,” said Greehey. “As the largest unitholder of NSH, I did not come to this decision lightly. I have always been a buyer of NSH and have never sold a unit. And I will continue to buy NuStar units. I would not recommend a simplification and reset if I did not truly believe that it will significantly improve the company’s long-term health and growth, as well as long-term unitholder value.\n\n“NuStar has a bright future. We have great assets, great management and great employees. We just completed a major acquisition in the Permian, which I feel will transform the company. It is meeting, and in some cases, exceeding our expectations and will continue to be a great platform for growth. The simplification and reset will enhance our ability to fund that growth with cash generated by our operations as well as through our enhanced access to lower cost capital. The economy is strong and oil prices are strengthening, so we should see our earnings increase and our unit value go up, which should set the stage for strong distribution growth going forward,” said Greehey.\n\nBarron noted that the merger is expected to provide many benefits to current Partnership unitholders and, upon exchange of their NSH units for Partnership common units at closing of the merger, current NSH unitholders, including:\n\nlowering the Partnership’s long-term cost of capital through the permanent elimination of the incentive distribution rights, allowing the Partnership to enhance its cash accretion from investments in organic growth projects and acquisitions;\n\nattracting a broader investor base to a single, larger entity;\n\nallowing the Partnership to maintain its competitive position when pursuing growth opportunities by increasing access to the equity markets, while simultaneously decreasing the need to access the equity markets;\n\nsimplifying the Partnership’s structure, which reduces complexity and enhances transparency for investors;\n\nreducing general and administrative costs by approximately $1 million per year primarily from eliminating public company expenses associated with NSH;\n\nmaintaining the Partnership’s financial flexibility as the unit-for-unit exchange finances 100% of the purchase with the Partnership’s equity; and\n\nproviding the Partnership’s unitholders the right to elect all of its directors.\n\nThe merger also provides NSH unitholders with:\n\nliquidity and less volatility by exchanging NSH units for Partnership common units;\n\nan opportunity to benefit from potential price appreciation and increased distributions through ownership of Partnership common units, which should benefit from the lower cost of capital associated with the permanent cancellation of the incentive distribution rights; and\n\na premium of 1.7% through the exchange of 0.55 of a Partnership common unit for each NSH unit based on closing prices for both equity securities on February 7, 2018.\n\nThe completion of the merger is subject to the approval of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding NSH units and other closing conditions, and is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018. The merger agreement may be terminated by either NSH or the Partnership if the merger has not closed on or prior to August 8, 2018 and for other limited circumstances set forth in the merger agreement.\n\nThe terms of the merger agreement were unanimously approved by NSH’s Conflicts Committee and by the Partnership’s Nominating/Governance & Conflicts Committee, each comprised solely of independent directors, and were approved by both NSH’s board of directors and the Partnership’s board of directors (in each case with Mr. Greehey and Mr. Barron recusing themselves).\n\nFinancial advisors for this transaction were Baird for NSH’s Conflicts Committee and Evercore for the Partnership’s Nominating/Governance & Conflicts Committee. Legal advisors for this transaction were Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz for NSH’s Conflicts Committee; Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. for the Partnership’s Nominating/Governance & Conflicts Committee; and Sidley Austin LLP for the Partnership.\n\nDistribution Reset\n\nAdditionally, on February 8, 2018, and in anticipation of the merger, the Partnership announced that management of the Partnership anticipated recommending to the Partnership’s board of directors, and the board of directors expects to adopt, a reset of its quarterly distribution per common unit to $0.60 ($2.40 on an annualized basis), starting with the first-quarter distribution payable in May 2018. After giving effect to the issuance of Partnership common units in connection with the merger, this distribution reset is anticipated to reduce annual distribution outflow by approximately $200 million per year.\n\n“A fundamental shift has occurred in the makeup of the investor base for MLPs, which has tightened MLP equity markets and access to equity to finance important capital projects needed to grow and increase long-term unitholder value,” said Barron. “In addition to the difficulty in the MLP sector, NuStar’s base business was significantly impacted last year from the combination of a series of destructive hurricanes, unexpected turnarounds at our customers’ refineries and a large, unanticipated reliability project on our ammonia line. And recently, with the widely reported economic strife in Venezuela and the mounting financial and operational challenges facing our St. Eustatius terminal anchor tenant, PDVSA, in an abundance of caution, we have adjusted our forecast on their utilization of the terminal this year, which significantly lowered our earnings projections.\n\n“Simultaneously, we have witnessed a paradigm shift in market sentiment away from strong growth fueled by continuous equity issuances to a market sentiment that favors strong distribution coverage and rewards MLPs for low leverage, less dependency on the equity markets, and increased self-funding of capital projects. So given the headwinds in our base business, and the changed market sentiment, we buckled down and put together an actionable plan, just as we did in 2014 when the dramatic plunge in crude prices reverberated throughout the energy industry,” said Barron. “We undertook a thorough, systematic analysis of our best path forward, taking into account the new MLP market priorities and limitations and our current strengths and challenges.\n\n“As we carefully considered all the alternatives, in every scenario, a distribution reset was a necessary part of the overall prescription to position us for the future,” said Barron. “Resetting NuStar Energy’s distribution will improve our coverage ratio immediately, and in the longer term, the reset will also serve to reduce both our leverage and our future needs to access the capital markets.\n\nEarnings Results for Fourth Quarter 2017 for the Partnership In Line with Guidance\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Partnership reported a net loss applicable to common limited partners of $0.3 million, or $0.00 per unit, compared to a $24 million net loss applicable to common limited partners, or $0.31 per unit for the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership reported net income applicable to common limited partners of $57 million, or $0.64 per unit, compared to $99 million, or $1.27 per unit for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nDistributable cash flow (DCF) available to common limited partners was $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $88 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, DCF available to common limited partners was $258 million, compared to $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $144 million, up from $83 million for fourth quarter 2016. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $595 million, up from $517 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is within our guidance of $575 million to $625 million.\n\nAbsent certain fourth quarter 2016 adjustments pertaining to a non-cash write-down on the carrying value of a term loan held by Axeon Specialty Products in conjunction with its sale of the asphalt marketing business that Axeon purchased from the Partnership in 2014, fourth quarter 2016 and year ended December 31, 2016 adjusted EBITDA would have been $141 million and $576 million, respectively. Additionally, fourth quarter 2016 and year ended December 31, 2016 adjusted net income per unit applicable to common limited partners would have been $0.42 and $2.00, respectively.\n\n“Our 4th quarter 2017 and full-year 2017 EBITDA results in our pipeline and storage segments were higher quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year when compared to 2016,” said Barron. “These higher results were largely the result of contributions from our Permian crude system and our December 2016 Martin terminal acquisition.\n\n“In the 4th quarter of 2017 and in January 2018, we received a total of $100 million in insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma that we expect will cover the cost of repairing the property damage to our facilities as well as most of our lost revenue, over our $5 million insurance deductible,” Barron added.\n\nAs previously announced on January 29, 2018, the fourth quarter 2017 Series A preferred unit distribution of $0.53125 per unit, Series B preferred unit distribution of $0.47657 per unit and an initial Series C preferred unit distribution of $0.65625 per unit will be paid on March 15, 2018 to holders of record as of March 1, 2018. In addition, the fourth quarter 2017 common unit distribution of $1.095 per unit will be paid on February 13, 2018 to holders of record as of February 8, 2018.\n\nEarnings Results for Fourth Quarter 2017 for NSH\n\nNSH today announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $7 million, or $0.17 per unit, and net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $87 million, or $2.01 per unit. Distributable cash flow (DCF) available to unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $21 million and $93 million, respectively.\n\nAs previously announced on January 29, 2018, the fourth quarter 2017 distribution of $0.545 per unit will be paid on February 15, 2018 to holders of record as of February 8, 2018.\n\nFinal Comments\n\n“As evidenced by these earnings results, the simplification and reset are needed to allow NuStar to compete with the growing number of our peers who have already made such structural adjustments,” said Barron.\n\n“We are confident that the combination of the simplification and the reset will provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to compete for good projects and position us to increase unitholder value, as we have in the past, and for many years to come,” he concluded.\n\nConference Call Details\n\nA conference call with management is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. CT today, February 8, 2018, to discuss the merger, the anticipated distribution reset and the financial and operational results for the fourth quarter of 2017.

NuStar Energy L.P. utilizes financial measures, such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), distributable cash flow (DCF) and distribution coverage ratio, which are not defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes these financial measures provide useful information to investors and other external users of our financial information because (i) they provide additional information about the operating performance of the partnership’s assets and the cash the business is generating, (ii) investors and other external users of our financial statements benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management and our board of directors when making financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) they highlight the impact of significant transactions.\n\nOur board of directors and management use EBITDA and/or DCF when assessing the following: (i) the performance of our assets, (ii) the viability of potential projects, (iii) our ability to fund distributions, (iv) our ability to fund capital expenditures and (v) our ability to service debt. In addition, our board of directors uses a distribution coverage ratio, which is calculated based on DCF, as one of the factors in its determination of the company-wide bonus and the vesting of performance units awarded to management. DCF is a widely accepted financial indicator used by the master limited partnership (MLP) investment community to compare partnership performance. DCF is used by the MLP investment community, in part, because the value of a partnership unit is partially based on its yield, and its yield is based on the cash distributions a partnership can pay its unitholders.\n\nNone of these financial measures are presented as an alternative to net income. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA, DCF and distribution coverage ratio:\n\nThree Months Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31, 20172016 20172016 Net income (loss) $ 25,182 $ (11,056 ) $ 147,964 $ 150,003 Interest expense, net 45,801 34,976 173,083 138,350 Income tax expense 2,639 2,680 9,937 11,973 Depreciation and amortization expense 70,589 55,997 264,232 216,736 EBITDA 144,211 82,597 595,216 517,062 Interest expense, net (45,801 ) (34,976 ) (173,083 ) (138,350 ) Reliability capital expenditures (27,297 ) (12,321 ) (57,497 ) (38,155 ) Income tax expense (2,639 ) (2,680 ) (9,937 ) (11,973 ) Mark-to-market impact of hedge transactions (a) (138 ) 3,825 (2,790 ) 10,317 Unit-based compensation (b) 26 2,120 5,354 5,619 Preferred unit distributions (13,532 ) (1,925 ) (40,448 ) (1,925 ) Other items (c) 80 63,943 (4,039 ) 73,846 DCF $ 54,910 $ 100,583 $ 312,776 $ 416,441 Less DCF available to general partner 13,238 12,886 54,921 51,284 DCF available to common limited partners $ 41,672 $ 87,697 $ 257,855 $ 365,157 Distributions applicable to common limited partners $ 102,029 $ 86,085 $ 407,681 $ 342,598 Distribution coverage ratio (d) 0.41x 1.02x 0.63x 1.07x\n\n(a) DCF excludes the impact of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses that arise from valuing certain derivative contracts, as well as the associated hedged inventory. The gain or loss associated with these contracts is realized in DCF when the contracts are settled. (b) In connection with the employee transfer from NuStar GP, LLC on March 1, 2016, we assumed obligations related to awards issued under a long-term incentive plan, and we intend to satisfy the vestings of equity-based awards with the issuance of our common units. As such, the expenses related to these awards are considered non-cash and added back to DCF. Certain awards include distribution equivalent rights (DERs). Payments made in connection with DERs are deducted from DCF. (c) Other items primarily consist of adjustments for throughput deficiency payments and construction reimbursements for all periods presented and a $58.7 million non-cash impairment charge on the Axeon term loan in the fourth quarter of 2016. (d) Distribution coverage ratio is calculated by dividing DCF available to common limited partners by distributions applicable to common limited partners.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2016\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2016\n\nEBITDA $ 82,597 $ 517,062 Loss on Axeon Term Loan 58,655 58,655 Adjusted EBITDA $ 141,252 $ 575,717\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of projected net income to projected EBITDA:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Projected net income $ 140,000 - 170,000 Projected interest expense, net 170,000 - 175,000 Projected income tax expense 5,000 - 10,000 Projected depreciation and amortization expense 260,000 - 270,000 Projected EBITDA $ 575,000 - 625,000\n\nNuStar GP Holdings, LLC and Subsidiaries\n\nConsolidated Financial Information\n\n(Unaudited, Thousands of Dollars, Except Unit and Per Unit Data)\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 20172016 20172016 Statement of Income Data: Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. $ 10,304 $ 6,671 $ 51,556 $ 56,096 General and administrative expenses (713 ) (669 ) (3,298 ) (3,046 ) Other income, net 339 266 41,942 3,021 Interest expense, net (453 ) (280 ) (1,587 ) (1,069 ) Income before income tax (expense) benefit 9,477 5,988 88,613 55,002 Income tax (expense) benefit (2,035 ) 11 (1,838 ) 66 Net income $ 7,442 $ 5,999 $ 86,775 $ 55,068 Net income per unit $ 0.17 $ 0.14 $ 2.01 $ 1.28 Weighted average number of common units outstanding 42,961,594 42,936,397 42,954,230 42,932,320 Equity in Earnings of NuStar Energy L.P.: General partner interest $ 14 $ (480 ) $ 1,237 $ 2,091 General partner incentive distribution 10,933 10,907 45,669 43,407 General partner’s interest in earnings and incentive\n\ndistributions of NuStar Energy L.P.\n\n10,947 10,427 46,906 45,498 Limited partner interest in earnings of NuStar\n\nEnergy L.P.\n\n78 (3,035 ) 7,534 13,482 Amortization of step-up in basis related to NuStar Energy\n\nL.P.’s assets and liabilities\n\n(721 ) (721 ) (2,884 ) (2,884 ) Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. $ 10,304 $ 6,671 $ 51,556 $ 56,096 Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities 9,797 6,162 47,793 49,751 Net cash provided by investing activities 13,955 17,273 34,016 40,286 Net cash used in financing activities (23,548 ) (23,588 ) (81,594 ) (89,864 ) Distributable Cash Flow (Note 1): Cash distributions from NuStar Energy L.P. associated with: General partner interest $ 2,305 $ 1,979 $ 9,252 $ 7,877 General partner incentive distribution 10,933 10,907 45,669 43,407 Limited partner interest – common units 11,185 11,185 44,740 44,699 Total cash distributions expected from NuStar Energy L.P. 24,423 24,071 99,661 95,983 Adjustments: General and administrative expenses (713 ) (669 ) (3,298 ) (3,046 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (2,035 ) 11 (1,838 ) 66 Interest expense, net (453 ) (280 ) (1,587 ) (1,069 ) Unit-based compensation $ 183 $ 159 $ (207 ) $ 494 DCF $ 21,405 $ 23,292 $ 92,731 $ 92,428 Total distribution to unitholders $ 23,423 $ 23,408 $ 93,649 $ 93,601\n\nNote 1: NuStar GP Holdings, LLC utilizes distributable cash flow (DCF) as a financial measure, although it is not defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
