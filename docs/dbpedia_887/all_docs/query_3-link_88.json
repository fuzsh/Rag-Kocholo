        "text": "Energy security is essential to the overall stability of any country and economic development. The Energy Community means a strategic project of cooperation between the European Union and the countries of Southeast Europe, and at the same time of the Western Balkans, in the field of energy, promoted at the beginning of this century. It defines the components of a process aimed at stability in the supply and functioning of the energy market. The Energy Union is a compatible plan the European Commission in providing optimal conditions for its members. The paper also discusses the implications of these concepts on the geo-economic position and perspectives of the Western Balkan countries.\n\nThe chapter addresses an important topic within the general debate on regional cooperation in the Western Balkans which could substantially help economic growth and development of these countries in the future â€“ namely regional cooperation in the energy sector. The new EU policy for the Western Balkans launched after mid-1999, embedded in the Stabilization and Association Process, as well as the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe (today the Regional Cooperation Council), have promoted various initiatives of regional cooperation among the Western Balkan countries, including cooperation in the field of energy. The chapter will consider the results achieved so far in regional cooperation among the Western Balkan countries in the energy sector, and illustrate why regional cooperation and integration of energy markets would have a series of beneficial effects.\n\nThe OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work together to address the economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.\n\nBalkan Peninsula is a region with insignificant quantity of energy resources. Its geographical location constitutes a potential energy corridor, by transporting energy raw materials from the wider Caspian Sea to European Union. EU is the world's largest importer of energy raw materials and at the same time it is greatly dependent on hydrocarbon imports. Although most Balkan countries are pro-European, European Union's energy sector remains uncoordinated as the relative interests of its member states are differentiated. In fact, the entire area constitutes an East-West and North-South intersection in which Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia have a particular geographical advantage. A regional complex environment such as Balkans requires alternative choices to meet energy objectives. Every country has to ensure supplier dispersion, energy security, top-level expert advice, appropriate energy infrastructure planning and specialized investment incentives. In order to achieve its energy goals, Greece must increase its energy autonomy and improve its cooperation with the other Balkan countries in all sectors. It ought to have a clear energy policy utilizing given advantages and appropriately associating with the various issues of its environment. Thus it can ultimately be able to exert meaningful influence by intervening directly or indirectly in decisions concerning various implemented projects in this fragile region. Balkan crude oil and gas transport networks, are the key strategic levers in the ongoing energy competition between the West and Russia. These are the reasons which are particularly important for Balkan countries' energy policy."
