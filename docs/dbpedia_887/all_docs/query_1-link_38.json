The park is situated in the mountainous region of Croatia. The park is primarily covered in forest vegetation, with smaller areas under grasslands. The most attractive part of the park – the lakes – cover just under 1% of the total park area.\n\nThe lake system is comprised of 16 named and several smaller unnamed lakes, cascading one into the next. Due to the geological substrate and characteristic hydrogeological conditions, the lake system has been divided into the Upper and Lower lakes.\n\nWith its exceptional natural beauty, this area has always attracted nature lovers, and already on 8 April 1949, it was proclaimed Croatia’s first national park. The process of tufa formation, which results in the building of the tufa, or travertine, barriers and resulted in the creation of the lakes, is the outstanding universal value, for which the Plitvice Lakes were internationally recognised on 26 October 1979 with their inscription onto the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1997, the boundaries of the national park were expanded, and today it covers an area just under 300 km2.\n\nBRONZE SPONSORS\n\nERSTE\n\nWhen you are a student, you need an account for 0 euros!\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you study, whether you work occasionally or more often, it’s important that you open an Erste current account for youngsters for your financial independence.\n\nFor 0 euros in Erste Bank, you get a current account for youngsters, a contactless Visa debit card and online banking George, and you can sign for everything 100% digitally.
