        "text": "It is hoped that we will be able, in due course, to connect this family to one of the pedigrees of Irish families shown in the 'Ancient & Mythical' section of the database. One possibility that has been considered is that the following Ceallachan Cashel (d 952), who is the first mentioned by BIFR1976 (which identifies him as the \"42nd Christian King of Munster, out of which he drove the Danes\") could have been the same person as Kennedy or Cennetig, King of Thomond (d 951), with Donogh McCarthy being Kennedy's son Donncuan. However, that would make Donogh half-brother of the famous King Brian Boru, which would surely have been mentioned in BIFR1976 had it been the case, and would make it difficult for Donogh's eldest son Saorbhreathach's alleged connection to the family shown on McCarthy01 to comply with the ancestry mentioned there."
