        "text": "The Rare Diseases Advisory Group (RDAG) makes recommendations to NHS England and the devolved administrations of NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and NHS Northern Ireland on developing and implementing the strategy for rare diseases and highly specialised services.\n\nHighly specialised services are provided to a smaller number of patients compared to specialised services; usually no more than 500 patients per year. For this reason they are typically best delivered nationally through a very small number of centres of excellence. Examples of highly specialised services include liver transplant services, enzyme replacement therapy and proton beam therapy for specific cancer treatments.\n\nRDAG makes recommendations to the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) about how highly specialised services should be commissioned. This includes recommending which expert centres should be nominated (or should no longer be nominated) to deliver highly specialised services.\n\nA key focus for RDAG’s work is the delivery of NHS England’s commitments as set out in the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases (document is available on our archived website), which was published in November 2013.\n\nRDAG receives recommendations from Clinical Reference Groups (CRGs) set up by NHS England, and in addition, formulates its advice by calling on sources of sound evidence from outside the NHS, such as professional bodies and patient groups.\n\nThe membership of RDAG is broad and includes representatives from Royal Colleges, commissioners, patient and public voice representation and professionals such as a geneticist and an ethicist. There is also representation from the devolved administrations – NHS Scotland, NHS Wales and NHS Northern Ireland.\n\nMembership\n\nChair: Louise Fish\n\nLouise Fish has over 25 years of executive and non-executive board experience of health and social care in the charitable, commercial and public sectors.\n\nLouise was formerly Chief Executive of Genetic Alliance UK, an alliance of over 200 organisations representing people with rare and genetic conditions.
