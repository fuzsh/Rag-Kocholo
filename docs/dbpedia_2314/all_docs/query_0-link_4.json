        "text": "Dease History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe Irish name Dease is an Anglicized version of the Gaelic name Déiseach, which is thought to have originally been a nickname for a member of the vassal community (feudal servants) called the Déis, a word of uncertain origin. There was also a Decies barony in County Waterford, and in some cases, this name likely originated with a native of that barony.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Dease family\n\nThe surname Dease was first found in counties Cork and Mayo (Irish: Maigh Eo) located on the West coast of the Republic of Ireland in the province of Connacht. It is thought that immigrants from Waterford took on this name after they arrived in their new homelands.\n\nThe first recorded instance of the name appears to be a bearer of Dacy, who was a Drogheda juror in Cork as early as 1313. There is a legend in Cork that all the Deasys of the county are ancestors of a child who was rescued from a massacre in the barony of Decies in about 1620. It is claimed that he was then protected by the O'Donovans of the Island, and went on to have seven sons.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Dease family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Dease research.
