        "text": "1941\n\n1 Sep-\n\nThe 8th Division took part in the Carolina Maneuvers. 1942\n\nMar-\n\nThe 8th Division returned to Camp Jackson, SC. late in March to resume training.\n\nSep-\n\nThere was a motor march to the area of the Tennessee Maneuvers. Two more months of war games further hardened the troops of the 8th. Then, after a brief stay in tents at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, the Division set out for its new station, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.\n\nDec-\n\nThere was another period of comparative calm. 1943\n\nMar-\n\nThe 8th moved to Camp Laguna, Arizona, for six months of desert training.\n\nAug-\n\nThe Division returned to Camp Forrest. Preparations were begun immediately for an overseas movement.\n\n27 Nov-\n\nThe 8th arrived at the staging area at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.\n\n5 Dec-\n\nThe 8th Infantry Division sailed from New York Harbor.\n\n15 Dec-\n\nThe Division arrived in Belfast, Northern Ireland for training. Every two weeks the Division sent seventy-five enlisted me and fifteen officers to the British 55th Division and received an equal number of United Kingdom troops for a two-week period. 1944\n\n1 Jul-\n\nA convoy of four troop ships and twelve motor transports carrying the 8th Division steamed out of Belfast Harbor.\n\n4 Jul-\n\nThe Division began debarking at Omaha Beach on the Cherbourg peninsula.\n\n6 Jul-\n\nThe Division assembled in the vicinity of Monteburg.\n\n7 Jul-\n\nThe 8th Infantry Division entered combat.\n\n8 Jul-\n\nThe Division jumped off on its first attack in the Battle of France.\n\n26 Jul-\n\nThe Division crossed the Ay River.\n\n28 Jul-\n\nResuming the advance the 8th Division proceeded rapidly against light resistance until it had taken all objectives.\n\n1 Aug-\n\nThe Division continued to move southward, clearing out small pockets of resistance and securing road nets and vital installations along the route of march.\n\n3 Aug-\n\nThe 8th Division reached St. James.\n\n4 Aug-\n\nThe Division moved to an assembly area near Betten, northeast of Rennes.\n\n8 Aug-\n\nThe Division pushed through Rennes.\n\n9 Aug-\n\nThe 3rd Battalion was cut off from the Regiment. For three days it withstood almost incessant artillery bombardment and repeated attempts by the enemy to annihilate it, suffering many casualties.\n\n13 Aug-\n\nThe 8th Division continued its mission of holding and defending Rennes. During this period, it maintained road blocks, cleared rubble and obstacles from the streets, and engaged in extensive patrolling. Although some prisoners were taken, no contact was made with organized enemy forces.\n\n14 Aug-\n\nThe Regiment occupied Dinard. A task force, composed mainly of the 3rd Battalion, 28th Infantry, moved to the Cap Frehel peninsula, farther east in Brittany, to take over positions held by French Forces of the Interior.\n\n15 Aug-\n\nThe Division, meanwhile, had moved to an assembly area near Dinan.\n\n17 Aug-\n\nThe remaining elements of the Division began movement to an assembly area near Brest. There, for three days, operations were confined to patrolling.\n\n21 Aug-\n\nThe Division closed into its sector and awaited orders to attack Brest.\n\n26 Aug-\n\nLt. Colonel Edmund Fry, commander of the 12th Engineer Combat Battalion was captured by the enemy, only to escape by sea and rejoin his battalion on the Crozon peninsula nineteen days later.\n\n29 Aug-\n\nThe enemy in the sector of the 3rd Battalion, 28th Infantry, called a truce to evacuate wounded. Previously, two companies of the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry, had advanced beyond their adjacent units, been cut off and captured by the Germans. After Brest had capitulated, these two companies were freed by men of their own unit from a German prisoner of war enclosure on the Crozon peninsula, south of the harbor of Brest, and returned to their unit.\n\n31 Aug-\n\nThe 8th prepared for a coordinated Corps attack which was to include also the 2nd Division. A road in the vicinity of the town of Kergroas was the objective.\n\n8 Sep-\n\nWith an improvement in the supply of artillery ammunition, the 121st Infantry attacked and seized the eastern end of the strongly defended Lambzellec ridge. The 121st then advanced toward the town of Lambzellec, and by noon was fighting in the streets. The 13th Infantry advanced abreast to positions from which it supported the attack of the 121st.\n\n10 Sep-\n\nHaving passed through Lambzellec, the 121st was confronted with Fort Bouguen. This was a formidable work of thick walls, twenty to thirty feet in height, surrounded by a dry moat, twenty feet deep. Such an obstacle could not be assaulted by infantry without artillery fire.\n\n11 Sep-\n\nHeavy artillery fire was directed on the wall. This fire failed to make an appreciable breach and the VIII Corps Commander decided to suspend further operations against that portion of the inner defenses, and to contain the enemy within Fort Bouguen, while efforts were renewed farther east. He therefore directed that elements of the 2nd Infantry Division relieve the 8th Division in front of the fort.\n\n12 Sep-\n\nThe 13th and 121st Infantry Regiments withdrew to a temporary assembly area near Plouvien.\n\n14 Sep-\n\nThe Division moved into its attack positions.\n\n15 Sep-\n\nAfter a strong barrage by heavy and light artillery and chemical mortars, the attack began. In the zone of the 28th Infantry, the 3rd Battalion led the attack. By 0930 it was approaching the hamlet of St. Eflez. The 3rd Battalion and the 1st following it were under heavy flanking fire from the south ridge. All officers of Company L became casualties. Tech Sergeant Charles E. Ballance reorganized the company and took command. He was killed by a sniper the next day. In the vicinity of St. Eflez, resistance grew so fierce that it was apparent that the main line of enemy defenses had been reached.\n\n16 Sep-\n\nGerman counterattacks on both ridges were repulsed. At 0700hrs the attack was renewed under cover of a dense fog, which was to furnish an effective mask for each morning of the Crozon action.\n\n19 Sep-\n\nCrozon Peninsula was cleared.\n\n26 Sep-\n\nThe 8th Division began the long move from the Crozon peninsula to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Foot troops and trucked vehicles made the journey by rail.\n\n30 Sep-\n\nMotorized elements drove in convoys, arriving near Ettelbruck, Luxembourg.\n\n7 Oct-\n\nA vehicle bearing Lt. Colonels Frederick J. Bailey, Jr. and John P. Usher of the 28th Infantry, was travelling well in rear of the front lines when it was flagged down by what appeared to be a U.S. Army captain and sergeant, standing beside a halted American First Army jeep. Pulling alongside, and hearing the captain talking wildly in German although he wore an American combat jacket and helmet, the 28th Infantry officers opened fire and killed the two men.\n\n9 Oct-\n\nTraining began with 1,538 officers and enlisted men available. They were armed for the most part with rifles, automatic weapons and several anti-tank guns. Eight companies of approximately 200 men each compro- mised the battalion. Five of these were rifle companies. Training of this unit was continued, for two hours daily, until October 20th.\n\n19 Oct-\n\nA plan was worked out to rotate the troops. One platoon at a time was relieved.\n\n3 Nov-\n\nBoth Vossenack and Schmidt had been taken, and a line of departure for the attack upon Hurtgen secured. So difficult was the terrain, however, that only foot troops could get through to Schmidt. There was no road between the two captured towns over which armor and anti-tank guns could move.\n\n7 Nov-\n\nUnable to get armored units through to the foot troops, the 28th Division was forced to withdraw from Schmidt. At one time, the Germans also recaptured half of Vossenack, but here their counterattack was again driven back.\n\n16 Nov-\n\nThe 13th Infantry and the 8th Reconnaissance Troop began the motor march of the 8th Division to the V Corps front, and by nightfall.\n\n19 Nov-\n\nAll elements of the Division had closed into their positions in the area southeast of Aachen.\n\n20 Nov-\n\nThe Division drove across France to Luxembourg and moved to the Hurtgen Forest.\n\n21 Nov-\n\nThe 121st Infantry opened the drive on Hurtgen. Attacking with three battalions abreast, the Regiment immediately ran into strong resistance. Enemy mortar and artillery tree bursts shattered the forested area and hailed shrapnel down upon infantry units whenever they attempted to advance, anti-personnel minefields further increased the peril of movement through the dense woods.\n\n24 Nov-\n\nThe attack of the 121st Infantry resumed.\n\n25 Nov-\n\nAt a conference of V and VII Corps Commanders it was decided to begin the armored attack on the morning of November 25th. At least three rifle companies were to advance astride the road during the night so the road could be cleared.\n\n26 Nov-\n\nEnemy pockets in the woods in front of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 121st Infantry were taken without opposition. Company F, 121st Infantry, had advanced to a point approximately 300 yards southwest of Hurtgen. Here it was met be dense machine gun fire. Company F held its advanced position during the night, and resumed the attack with the entire regiment the next morning.\n\n27 Nov-\n\nThe 1st Battalion, 13th Infantry, joined the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 121st Infantry in the attack at 0700. Division Artillery, less the 43rd Field Artillery Battalion, again fired prearranged concentrations in support of the infantry units. Company C of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion was also in close support.\n\n28 Nov-\n\nThe Division cleared Hurtgen.\n\n29 Nov-\n\nThe attack on Kleinhau began. The enemy defended stubbornly, holding out in cellars and wooded areas even after armored forces had driven through the town. During the night, the 1st Battalion, 13th Infantry, took over the captured town and the high ground.\n\n30 Nov-\n\nMen of the 13th cleared out remaining enemy pockets.\n\n31 Nov-\n\nElements of the 121st and 28th continued to push southeast. Patrols were sent out by both regiments to determine enemy strength around Brandenburg. Resistance was encountered almost immediately, and orders were issued to hold present positions until plans for a full scale attack were completed.\n\n3 Dec-\n\nThe Division cleared Brandenburg. 1945\n\n23 Feb-\n\nThe Division crossed the Roer river.\n\n25 Feb-\n\nDuren taken.\n\n28 Feb-\n\nErft Canal crossed.\n\n7 Mar-\n\nThe 8th reached the Rhine near Rodenkirchen and maintained positions along the river near Koln.\n\n6 Apr-\n\nThe Division attacked northwest to aid in the destruction of enemy forces in the Ruhr Pocket.\n\n17 Apr-\n\nThe Division completed its mission."
