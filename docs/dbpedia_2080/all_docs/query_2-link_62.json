In some cases the ‘Enemy action or report’ should be read before the ‘Battalion action or report’. Its not ideal but you cannot post Tables!\n\nKey\n\nTime or + which indicates an event at a later time but before the next actual time\n\nBattalion action or report\n\nEnemy action or report - in Italics\n\n_________________\n\n03.00 to 10.00\n\nMen ordered to ‘Stand to’ and wear their Box Respirators, which they did for 3 (4?) hours until the area was reported clear of gas.\n\nGas bombardment lasted to 07.00, a favouring breeze helped to clear it.\n\nDITCH POST and the trenches in the vicinity of the Gavrelle-Arras Road were very heavily knocked about.\n\nBattalion front bombarded for 7 hours after which it lifted to the back areas.\n\nIntense bombardment on Brigade front by all calibres from 8 inch downwards. Large quantities of gas shells falling all along the BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE.\n\nBombardment was especially on DITCH POST, BAILLUL EAST POST, BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE and for 100yds either side of the Gavrelle to POINT DU JOUR Road\n\n03.00\n\nBarrage on NAVAL Line and posts in rear.\n\n05.45 to 07.15\n\nGarrison of GAVRELLE POST withdrew to TOWY POST\n\nBarrage also on front line.\n\nEnemy in WILLIE TRENCH.\n\nEnemy penetrated Gavrelle, both flanks of TOWY POST and entered TOWY ALLEY.\n\n07.20\n\nSOS reported.\n\nBombing parties sent up TOWY ALLEY, THAMES ALLEY and TYNE ALLEY.\n\nBlocks established in TYNE ALLEY and the GAVRELLE BAILLEUL Road\n\n+\n\nLondon Rifle Brigade and Queens Westminster Rifles were driven back to BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE via THAMES ALLEY and TOWY ALLEY.\n\nMen of the Machine Gun Company with 3 machine guns retreated down TOWY ALLEY and set up their guns in the line.\n\nThe garrison of the BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE was thickened up by about 60 London Rifle Brigade and 160 Queens Westminster Rifles from the forward system.\n\nThese reinforcements were very welcome as the line was thinly held particularly on the left.\n\nEnemy bombing parties in TYNE ALLEY\n\n08.45\n\nLewis Gunners and riflemen open fire on them and cause them to seek shelter.\n\nSmall parties of German troops wearing full packs seen in the direction of TYNE ALLEY and MARINE TRENCH\n\n+\n\nLeft company’s Lewis Gunners and riflemen fire on them picking off their leaders. This stopped their advance and later they withdrew\n\nLine of Skirmishers approach\n\n09.45\n\nCpt Whittle (QWR attached) took command of THAMES ALLEY from CASTLEFORD to the main trench, with 2 bombing sections to help.\n\n+\n\nKEILLER POST held out for a considerable time.\n\nCASTLEFORD POST was still intact until after nightfall\n\n+\n\nStopped by Artillery, machine guns, Lewis Guns and rifle fire\n\nEnemy make two attacks on BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE\n\n+\n\nDriven off time and again by Lewis Guns.\n\nEnemy aeroplanes in large patrols (3 to 13) flew low over trenches directing artillery fire and firing at the trench garrisons.\n\nLater in morning\n\n‘A’ Company position in TYNE ALLEY taken over by the London Scottish\n\n11.30\n\n‘A’ company 8th Middlesex sent up to hold the new switch trench adjoining the BAILLEUL-WILLERVAL LINE north of DITCH POST and TOWY ALLEY. They remained their all day\n\n13.50\n\nParties observed withdrawing towards MARINE TRENCH from TYNE ALLEY\n\n14.00 to 18.00\n\nIntensive artillery barrage mainly on BAILLEUL EAST POST and DITCH POST\n\n16.00\n\nThis method of advance was speedily stopped by rifle fire.\n\nGermans advanced across the open but with the exception of 2 or 3 snipers did not fire. Whole sections threw their rifles forward, then rushed forward with their hands up to where their rifles had fallen, picked their rifles up, threw their rifles forward again, and so on.\n\n3 or 4 crept within 40yds of the wire.\n\nGerman troops were in Full Marching Order and appeared to be well trained physically, but their attack seemed to lack leadership and enthusiasm.\n\n16.45\n\nThese having fired about 20 rounds received attention from our own artillery and were forced to withdraw\n\n4 field guns were reported in action near NAVAL TRENCH firing over open sights at DITCH POST\n\n+\n\nNumerous small parties seen moving backwards and forwards throughout the day\n\n+\n\nInformed that 5 enemy divisions had been identified in the attack on the Divisional front.\n\n21.30\n\nOrders received for the Brigade to be relieved by the 7th and 8th Middlesex\n\n168th Brigade. 1/4th London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) Summary\n\nThe actions of the battalion and enemy on the 28th March 1918.\n\nKey\n\nTime or + which indicates an event at a later time but before the next actual time\n\nBattalion action Or report\n\nEnemy action or report in italics\n\n_________________\n\n03.00\n\nForward area was hardly affected by this shelling. No casualties\n\nHeavy shelling with gas and later with HE on BOW TRENCH and OUSE ALLEY.\n\n05.00\n\nBlocks in OUSE ALLEY were lowered and extra rum and small arms ammunition issued to men.\n\n05.40\n\nOUSE ALLEY and the EARL-MARQUIS LINE at first escaped attention, but later came in for a fair share of the shelling.\n\nHeavy bombardment with Trench Mortars and Howitzers on the Front Line Posts.\n\n07.30\n\nSOS wired from OPPY POST and then the other two a few minutes later.\n\nSOS Mortars fired from WOOD POST, BEATTY POST and both Battalion HQs.\n\nOUSE ALLEY was manned by this time.\n\nEnemy advance over the open to the left of OPPY WOOD; seen from Forward Battalion HQ.\n\n07.30 to\n\nOPPY POST Report\n\nTrench mortars caused many casualties before the actual attack.\n\nRifle and Lewis Gun fire caused many casualties; one Lewis Gun being fired from the hip!\n\nThose that escaped came back along BEDFORD ROW and BOYNE TRENCH, they then manned the MARQUIS LINE.\n\nGarrison: 2 Officers, 48 Other Ranks\n\nReturned: 1 Officer, 5 Other Ranks\n\nThe enemy were very close to the post and swamped it almost from the start.\n\n07.30 to 08.30\n\nWOOD POST Report\n\nThe bombardments did not touch the new post but fell well in front of the old post.\n\nThey were met by heavy rifle fire and fire from 2 Lewis Guns.\n\nForced them back with No. 23 Grenades.\n\nThe enemy were checked in the wood and on the left.\n\nStretcher Bearers were working in the WOOD.\n\nAs ammunition and Grenades were getting short he survivors withdrew along BEDFORD ROW and BOYNE TRENCH to the MARQUIS LINE.\n\nGarrison: 2 Officers, 45 Other Ranks\n\nReturned: 1 Officer, 15 Other Ranks\n\nEnemy advance in an extended line (~2 paces) over the open ground on the left of the wood. They came through the wood in groups of 10 men about 50 yards apart. Further groups of 30 men followed 200 yards behind the first line.\n\nAttempted to force the block in the communications trench leading from the old to the new post.\n\nCaptured BEATTY POST and working around WOD POST from NEW CUT.\n\nEnemy worked along NEW CUT and BAKER STREET and captured the Platoon HQ dugout.\n\nSergeant Frank Udall MM and two bars was 80 yards behind the front line post, behind him were two or three Vickers machine guns.\n\n07.30 to 07.45\n\nBEATTY POST Report\n\nPost badly damaged by Trench Mortars.\n\nRapid fire caused many casualties.\n\nSurvivors withdrew via BAKER STREET to the MARQUIS LINE over the open\n\nGarrison: 3 Officers, 84 Other Ranks\n\nReturned: 1 Officer, 6 Other Ranks\n\nEnemy advanced in much the same way as reported by WOOD POST. Some of the leading line fired rifle grenades from their hips.\n\nEnemy worked around the right flank and got into MARINE TRENCH and OUSE ALLEY in great numbers eventually swamping the garrison.\n\n+\n\nNarrative states that WOOD POST held out for about an hour inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Their good work probably saved the MARQUIS-LINE being over-run on the right near the Forward Battalion HQ.\n\n+\n\nAfter the posts had been lost the MARQUIS LINE easily held up the enemy.\n\nMajor FA Philips orders 2/Lieut OC Hudson’s platoon to form a defensive flank. This position inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy which it caught in enfilade as they broke through over EARL to VISCOUNT STREET .\n\n2/Lieut OC Hudson’s platoon in the MARQUIS LINE astride OUSE ALLEY to form a defensive flank.
