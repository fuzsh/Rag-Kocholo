His previous books include The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788–1838.\n\n‘John Connor’s accessible and illuminating reinterpretation of World War I presents that conflict as a fundamentally imperial phenomenon. This was a war fought and ultimately won not only in France, Belgium and Palestine, but in East Africa and New Guinea; in the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as the Dardanelles and the North Sea; and on the farms of the Canadian prairie, the cattle ranches of Argentina and the sheep stations of Australia, as surely as in the munitions works of Britain.

At Bloomsbury Publishing, Jo Godfrey, Sophie Campbell and Carolann Young patiently and painstakingly brought the idea of the book into a reality. I thank the Canberra campus of the University of New South Wales for providing me with a UNSW Canberra Academic Startup Research Grant in 2007, a UNSW Early Career Researcher Grant in 2008, and a Special Studies Program in 2012 which enabled me to conduct the bulk of the United Kingdom archival research. This research trip was abruptly truncated for the happiest of reasons when my eldest daughter Claudia was joined by her little sister Claire, who was born in Canberra four weeks premature on 25 October. I express my gratitude to the expert and helpful staff at a wide range of archives, libraries and museums. In Australia, the UNSW Canberra Library was always my first port of call, and revealed many hidden gems, including a small cache of letters and papers by George McMunn, author of The Armies of India, and the vast photographic collection of the Doug Robertson Maritime and Naval History Collection. To this must be added the other great national institutions in Canberra: the Australian War Memorial, the National Archives of Australia, and the National Library of Australia, including its magnificent collection of private papers and digitised newspapers. I thank the Western Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party for granting me access to their papers held at the J.S. Battye Library of West Australian History in Perth.\n\nxvi\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nIn the United Kingdom, research took me to the British Library, the Cayzer Archives, the Imperial War Museum – where accessing the private papers of Sir Henry Wilson was made easy, thanks to the detailed catalogue of the General’s correspondence compiled by the late Professor Keith Jeffery of Queen’s University, Belfast – the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King’s College London, The National Archives and the National Maritime Museum in London. I also visited the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge and the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre in Chippenham. I must thank Kate Lamb and Gareth Mitchell for all their generous hospitality over many years. In Ottawa, I researched at Library and Archives Canada/Bibliothèque et Archives Canada, and Canadian War Museum/Musée Canadien de la Guerre; in Wellington, Archives New Zealand/Te Rua Mahara o te Ka¯wanatanga, and in Dublin, the National Library of Ireland/Leabharlann Náisiúnta na hÉireann. I thank the following institutions and individuals for generously providing images without charge: Dr Andrew Richardson of the Australian Army History Unit, Greg Swinden of the Sea Power Centre – Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand/Te Puna Ma¯tauranga o Aotearoa. Susan Ross and Dr Tim Cook at the Canadian War Museum/ Musée Canadien de la Guerre helpfully guided me through their image ordering process. Many of the ideas and arguments incorporated in this book originated and were developed in seminar and conference papers at a diverse range of venues. These include ‘Australia, empire and the Great War’ presented at the Menzies Centre for Australian Studies, King’s College London in October 2012, ‘World War I, farmers and elections’ presented at UNSW Canberra in May 2013, ‘The British Empire and the Great War: Colonial Societies/Cultural Responses’ conference at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in February 2014, the ‘Conscription Conflict and the First World War’ workshop, funded by the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, at the University of Melbourne in April 2015, and the ‘Military Education and Empire 1854–1918’ conference at the Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario, in November 2015. In 2016 and 2017, I was fortunate to be the Australian team leader of an Australia–Germany Joint Research Cooperation Scheme/Deutscher\n\nacknowledgements\n\nxvii\n\nAkademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) grant entitled ‘The First World War, 100 Years on: Transnational cultures of remembrance in interdisciplinary comparison’. This project brought together my UNSW Canberra colleague Dr Christina Spittel and doctoral candidate Tom Sear in collaboration with Prof. Oliver Janz, Dr Andrey Zamoisky, Dr Michael Elm, Martin Bayer and Nicolai Burbass of Freie Universität Berlin. Hosting our German colleagues in Canberra, where they encountered the uncritical commemorative culture of the Anzac Day dawn service at the Australian War Memorial, and then having the opportunity to contrast this interpretation with the brutal reality of conflict in the exhibits of the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden was an education in itself. Working with Professor Janz and his colleagues and students broadened my understanding of the Great War and its aftermath and influenced the writing of this book. I must thank the community of scholars with whom I discussed various aspects of the book. These include Dr Robin Archer (London School of Economics), Dr Kate Ariotti (University of Newcastle Australia), Prof. Ian Beckett (University of Kent), Prof. Frank Bongiorno (Australian National University), Prof. Carl Bridge (King’s College London), Prof. Joy Damousi (University of Melbourne), Prof. Brian Farrell (National University of Singapore), Prof. Richard Grayson (Goldsmiths, University of London), Dr Ian Henderson (King’s College London), Dr Spencer Jones (University of Wolverhampton), Prof. Jennifer Keene (Chapman University, California), Dr Jenny Macleod (University of Hull), Assistant Prof. John Mitcham (Duquesne University, Pennsylvania), Dr David Monger (University of Canterbury, New Zealand), Dr William Mulligan (University College, Dublin), Prof. William Philpott (King’s College London), Prof. Jan Rüger (Birkbeck, University of London), Prof. Gary Sheffield (University of Wolverhampton), Dr Richard Smith (Goldsmiths, University of London), Prof. Ian van der Waag (Stellenbosch University) and Dr Peter Yule (University of Melbourne). Before his sudden death on 26 July 2016, I had many insightful discussions with Prof. Jeffrey Grey – the first non-American to become President of the Society for Military History – in the morning tea-room chats in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences which doubled as an unfailing and thought-provoking history seminar.\n\nxviii\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nFinally, I must thank all my colleagues at UNSW Canberra. Prof. Shirley Scott has been a supportive Head of School. I need to acknowledge the constant assistance of Bernadette McDermott, Marg McGee, Shirley Ramsay and Eric Zhang, without whom the School of Humanities and Social Sciences could not function. I thank Ricardo Banos of the UNSW Canberra Creative Media Unit for creating the map of the British Empire in 1914. In particular, I must express my deepest admiration to the indomitable members of the History Discipline: Emeritus Prof. Peter Dennis, Dr Richard Dunley, Dr Elizabeth Greenhalgh, Associate Prof. Eleanor Hancock, Dr Debbie Lackerstein, Dr Tom Richardson, Dr David Stahel, Prof. Peter Stanley and Prof. Craig Stockings, currently at the Australian War Memorial as the Official Historian of Australian Operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor. Over the last three years, the History Discipline has faced the challenge of maintaining the teaching programme as historians who left or retired were not replaced. Through all of this, it remained united and maintained collegiality. My colleagues even enabled me to take internal release from teaching in the second half of 2017 in order to complete the writing of this book, an act of generosity for which I will be eternally grateful. To perhaps steal a phrase from Dr Richard Dunley, our new naval historian, we have endured stormy seas and now look forward to calmer waters.\n\nBRITISH EMPIRE IN 1914\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nCANADA\n\nNEWFOUNDLAND\n\nCyprus Bermuda\n\nMalta\n\nGibraltar\n\nBahamas\n\nWei Hai Wei\n\nEGYPT St Lucia Barbados Tobago Trinidad\n\nJamaica\n\nBR.

More than 8.5 million men would volunteer or be conscripted to fight the Central Powers of Austria–Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany and the Ottoman Empire in bloody campaigns that spanned the globe. Of these, 2.8 million British Empire soldiers would be killed or wounded.1 When the war began in August 1914, recruiting was initially limited to mostly – but not entirely – white soldiers from Britain and Ireland, the self-governing Dominions of New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, Canada and Australia and the ‘martial races’ of the Indian Army. However, following the unprecedented losses of British Empire lives on the Western Front during 1915, Andrew Bonar Law, the United Kingdom Colonial Secretary, called in October of that year for ‘raising troops in large numbers in our Colonies and Protectorates for Imperial service’. Recruiting was broadened to include an increasing number of non-white troops from Africa, the Caribbean, New Zealand Maori, Canadian First Nations and Indigenous Australians. From December 1916, most British Empire troops employed in the East African campaign were black Africans. By the time of the Ottoman surrender in October 1918, four-fifths of the divisions in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force included Indian units.2\n\n2\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nThe soldiers who made the longest journey to take part in the war were 500 Polynesian volunteers from Niue and the Cook Islands in the South Pacific who served with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). However, when they arrived on the Western Front in early 1916, their exposure to the bitter northern European winter weather resulted in over half the Niue contingent being admitted to hospital. By May, they were being repatriated to their tropical home.3 Across the Empire, supporters of the war contended with those opposed to involvement in the conflict, the continuation of the colonial connection, and individuals enduring harsh wartime economic conditions. In April 1916, the withdrawal of troops from Bongo in the West African colony of Gold Coast led to a local revolt that was quashed by a military punitive expedition that killed almost 60 people. At the beginning of August 1917, tram mechanics in Sydney went on strike to oppose the introduction of time cards that would calculate how many hours each employee worked. The tram mechanics’ cause struck a chord with workers across the country and led to what economic historian Peter Yule described as ‘the most serious and prolonged industrial action [. . .] in Australian history’. Seventy-six thousand workers across three of the six Australian states walked out in sympathy. The depressed economy forced other men to take jobs as nonunion strike breakers, one of whom was killed. By the time the strike ended in September, 2.5 million man-days and 1.7 million pounds in workers’ wages had been lost. The New South Wales government, having defeated the workers, installed their time clocks in the Sydney tramway workshops.4 The British Empire was the greatest political entity the world had ever seen, and it would expand even further at the end of the war with the annexation of German colonies and Ottoman Empire territory. The 1911 census calculated that the British Empire had a population of 424,133,076. This exact number offered a comforting façade of scientific accuracy that, like many other aspects of the Empire, did not reflect a more ramshackle reality. The inhabitants of Sarawak in Borneo went uncounted, the population of British Somaliland was an estimate, and the Gold Coast census figure was subsequently admitted to be an undercount.5 The British Empire was a complex collection of political entities that ranged in scale from India, with a population over 250 million inhabitants, which King George V ruled as a separate realm with the title of Emperor\n\nintroduction – the british empire and world war i\n\n3\n\nof India, to the tiny, storm-tossed Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, administered by the Admiralty and inhabited by a scattering of Royal Marines and sailors.6 The monarchy was identified as the central foundation of Empire. George V was crowned on 22 June 1911, following the death the previous year of his father, Edward VII. The mystical aura that surrounded the monarchy at this time was reflected in British journalist Philip Gibbs’ dreamlike vision of the coronation; he wrote of the new monarch: He is the central, lonely figure of the great drama which has been a year in preparation. He is the most powerful King on earth, who in a little while has to receive the symbols of his power, to be anointed in the pretty office of kingship, to be consecrated to the people. His people!\n\nDuring the anointing ceremony, Gibbs imagined the King hearing the whispered advice of previous kings crowned in Westminster Abbey: Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror and Charles I. After the ceremony, he heard ‘the tumult of a nation’s enthusiasm, and in his heart the fire of great love for all the people of whom he is the Chief ’.7 The coronation was celebrated in various ways across the ethnically diverse Empire. In the Straits Settlements, made up of the ports of Malacca, Penang and Singapore in Southeast Asia, the population of 714,069 consisted mostly of Malays, Chinese and Indians. Colonies gener­ally lacked fully democratic institutions. The Straits Settlements’ govern­ment consisted of a governor, Sir Arthur Young, appointed by the Colonial Office, an unelected executive council of senior officials and a legislative council of appointed members with two men nominated by the Singapore and Penang Chambers of Commerce.8 In the week leading up to the coronation, prayers for the King were offered in churches, temples and mosques. The Singapore Straits Times patriotically proclaimed: We speak in many languages, follow many creeds, represent various types of civilisation, and possibly also, a few degrees of barbarity. But we are all loyal to the Flag that waves over us, because we know that\n\n4\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nit represents as near an approach to the perfect theory of equality and justice as any human institution of our time can reach.9\n\nAn anonymous Straits Times journalist described the Singaporean coron­ ation parade: Afterwards came the long, weird procession, formed by the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities [. . .] Those who have never witnessed such a display of native rejoicing must have marvelled greatly at the quaint costumes and mannerisms of the actors in the performance. Here were bold warriors with their sundangs and tombaks; there were flashes of light from grotesque lanterns; elsewhere rumbled along a decorated car carrying little girls and a big silver crown. There, the jumpy Chinese dragon would shamble along, followed by illuminated paper fish resting contentedly on poles held by youngsters who took a pride in their special clan. Further along one would me[e]t an electrically illuminated Singhalese bungalow with live inhabitants pummelling away on drums, or instruments resembling drums [. . .] But everything appeared to harmonise or should have done so in view of the strangeness of it all.\n\nHowever, it was clear that the journalist was oblivious to the significance of the dances and the music he had observed. He concluded: ‘If only one knew what it meant there would be an interesting story to tell.’10 The self-governing Dominions – Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South Africa – sent their prime ministers to London to witness the coronation and attend the Imperial Conference. The Dominions determined their own internal governance, but the United Kingdom government conducted foreign policy on behalf of the entire Empire. This meant that if Britain went to war, the Dominions were at war, though they could – and would – determine the extent of their con­ tribution in time of conflict.11 As part of the conference, Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, briefed the Dominion ministers on foreign policy in a closed meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on 26 May 1911. Grey outlined to his audience the decline in British–German relations. He\n\nintroduction – the british empire and world war i\n\n5\n\nstated that it was now ‘apparent that our relations with Russia and France were better than our relations with Germany’.12 The Foreign Secretary’s comments marked a significant shift in the United Kingdom’s external relations. Britain and France had come close to war over colonial claims in Africa in 1898, but London and Paris had ended their territorial disputes with the signing of the ‘Entente Cordiale’ or ‘friendly agreement’ on 8 April 1904. Berlin objected to the increasing French influence in Morocco and threatened to go to war with France. The most significant outcome of what became known as the First Moroccan Crisis was that the French and British armies began discussing in early 1906 how they might work together in the event of a war with Germany.13 The Second Moroccan Crisis arose at the beginning of July 1911, about a month after the Imperial Conference. Like the first, it was a dispute between Germany and France over control of Morocco. David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer in H.H. Asquith’s Liberal government, publicly stated on 21 July that the United Kingdom would not stand aside in the event of a war between the two continental powers. He asserted: I would make great sacrifices to preserve peace. I conceive that nothing would justify a disturbance of international good will except questions of the greatest national moment. But if a situation were to be forced upon us in which peace could only be preserved by the surrender of the great and beneficent position Britain has won by centuries of heroism and achievement, by allowing Britain to be treated where her interests were vitally affected as if she were of no account in the Cabinet of nations, then I say emphatically that peace at that price would be a humiliation intolerable for a great country like ours to endure.\n\nOnce more war was averted, but in August Brigadier Henry Wilson, the Director of Military Operations, told Home Secretary Winston Churchill: In my opinion a war between ourselves and Germany is as certain as anything human can be. If it does not come today it will tomorrow or the next day, and in all probability it will come at a time which suits Germany and not us.14\n\n6\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nFrom 8 to 12 July, King George and Queen Mary visited Dublin, ‘the second city in the Empire’. Ireland was a divided society with two communities. The first was the Catholic majority that was mostly – but not entirely – demanding Home Rule with the creation of a separate parliament in Dublin. The second was the Protestant minority that was mostly – but not entirely – demanding to remain part of the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists protested and distributed leaflets, but the royal visit was not disrupted. The King visited St Patrick’s College, the Catholic seminary and degree-granting college of the National University of Ireland, at Maynooth, west of Dublin, where he was hosted by Daniel Mannix, the College President and future Archbishop of Melbourne who would become a strident opponent of conscription in Australia. This would be the only time a reigning British monarch visited Ireland while the entire island was completely part of the United Kingdom.15 On 11 November, the King and Queen began their last major task of the coronation year: sailing to India to take part in the Durbar (royal court) in Delhi. They arrived at Bombay on 2 December, and travelled by train to Delhi. Here the royal couple met men and women of the Indian elite. The Durbar took place on a plain near the Jumna (Yamuna) river. At its heart was a dais with a marble platform with two thrones made of solid silver covered in gold. There was an inner circular amphitheatre for princes and dignitaries, and a larger outer amphitheatre that could seat 10,000 people. George wore the Crown of India – the £60,000 cost having been borne by Indian taxpayers – which, having been worn once, was returned to London and placed in the Tower of London.16 The King announced at the Durbar on 12 December that the province of Bengal – controversially partitioned on religious lines in 1903 by the then-Viceroy, Lord Curzon – would be reunited, and that the Indian capital would be moved from Calcutta to Delhi. The Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda, second in rank among Indian rulers, turned his back on the King-Emperor and Queen Empress when departing the pavilion. This apparently deliberate snub caused outrage in Britain and led to demands for the Maharaja’s removal.17 The Indian Army was considered one of Britain’s ‘great strategical assets’, due to its large size and military competence. Following the great mutiny of 1857, recruiting for the Indian Army shifted to take considerably\n\nintroduction – the british empire and world war i\n\n7\n\nfewer men from the Hindu majority and more from non-Hindu ethnic minorities, particularly Punjabi Muslims and Sikhs, in the belief they would be less likely to revolt. A pseudoscience of ‘martial race theory’ was developed to justify this new recruiting practice. George MacMunn argued that, unlike in Europe, where all males can become soldiers, ‘in the East, with certain exceptions, only certain clans and classes can bear arms; the others have not the physical courage necessary for the warrior’. This assertion would be proved false when the Indian Army expanded without declining in military effectiveness during World War I.18 The United Kingdom general election of December 1910 had resulted in Prime Minister Herbert Asquith retaining power with the support of John Redmond’s Irish Parliamentary Party. As part of the parties’ agree­ ment, the government introduced an Irish Home Rule Bill to Parliament in spring 1912. Tragically, Home Rule supporters did not offer concessions that might have eased the concerns of Ulster Unionists. Instead, the Ulster Volunteer Force was created in January 1913 to oppose Home Rule, and Nationalists established the National Volunteers in November. It has been argued that the outbreak of World War I prevented the outbreak of an Irish civil war in 1914. When Asquith gave a speech in Dublin on 26 September, the London Times reported the ‘spectacle of Irishmen of both parties fighting shoulder to shoulder will gladden the whole Empire and smooth the way, we trust, for a better understanding afterwards’. But, as Keith Jeffery points out, the intervention of conflict actually prevented the finding of ‘an accommodation in Ireland’ in 1914, and resulted in extremism and decades of conflict.19 On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria–Hungary, was assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip. Many senior political and military figures in Austria–Hungary feared the rise of nationalist movements that would lead to the break-up of the multiethnic empire. General Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, the army chief, had called for a pre-emptive war with Serbia on several occasions, but had been denied by Franz Ferdinand. Ironically, the Archduke’s death opened the way for the Serbian invasion he had always opposed.20 On 5 July, Count Alexander Hoyos of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry visited Berlin and gained Kaiser Wilhelm’s support for a punitive war on Serbia, once the army returned at the end of the month from\n\n8\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\ntheir annual leave to bring in the harvest. The Kaiser told Ladislaus de Szögyény-Marich, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador to Germany, that if Vienna ‘really recognised the necessity of warlike action against Serbia, then he would regret if we did not make use of the present moment, which was so favourable for us’.21 The ultimatum was presented in Belgrade on 23 July. Although the Serbian government accepted almost all of the demands, Austria–Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July. Gunboats in the Danube began the bombardment of Belgrade the following day. On 31 July, on the order of President Raymond Poincaré, French troops withdrew ten kilometres from the border ‘to show the public, and the English Government, that France will not, under any circumstances, be the aggressor’. Elsewhere, the situation swiftly deteriorated. Tsar Nicholas II ordered the general mobilisation of the Russian Army – the largest military force in Europe. Germany responded on 1 August by declaring war on Russia.22 Berlin’s strategy, known as the Schlieffen or Moltke Plan, put most of the German Army in the west with the aim of advancing through Belgium to quickly defeat France and then transfer the troops to the east to defeat Russia. On the evening of 3 August, the British sent an ultimatum to Germany warning Berlin not to invade Belgium. They did so the following day. When a second ultimatum expired at 11.00 pm on 4 August, the British Empire was at war. That night, the English writer John Galsworthy wrote in his diary: ‘Belgium’s neutrality violated by Germany. We are in . . . The horror of the thing keeps coming over one in waves; and all happiness has gone out of life.’23\n\nImportant Note Regarding the term ‘coloured’: in South Africa in the early twentieth century, ‘coloured’ denoted a multiracial ethnic group, with mixed ancestry, who identified as neither ‘white’ nor ‘black’. This definition was based not only on physical characteristics but also on family history and cultural practices. The term is retained in this book in its historical context.\n\n1\n\n1914: The Emden in the Indian Ocean\n\nT\n\nhe Great War came to India on the balmy tropical night of 22 September 1914, when the German cruiser Emden sailed undetected into the harbour of Madras (modern Chennai). D.S. Bremner, a journalist with the Madras Mail, was travelling to his newspaper office to prepare the next day’s edition when, around 9.30 pm, the Emden suddenly announced its presence by illuminating the night sky with its four searchlights. Bremner told his Indian driver to halt his horse-drawn carriage, jumped out and made for the esplanade. He had not travelled far when the Emden, having located the Burmah Oil Company’s facility north of the city, began firing its starboard broadside of five 4.1-inch (105-millimetre) guns at the six enormous white fuel tanks. Almost immediately, a ‘column of flame sprang into the sky’ as two tanks containing kerosene exploded. Bremner ran to the beach alongside three soldiers of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, two on foot and a third in a rickshaw pulled by an Indian man. Here they saw the German cruiser, made visible by the glow of its searchlights, sailing at full steam in the harbour. The Emden had fired about 130 shells at the fuel tanks when the guns of Fort St George began their tardy reply around 10.00 pm. At this, the Emden extinguished its searchlights, silenced its guns and, shielded by darkness, slipped out of the harbour and escaped unscathed to the open sea.1 When Bremner finally made his way back from the beach towards the Madras Mail office, he came across a man who ‘was explaining the\n\n10\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nsituation’ in Tamil to a gathering crowd. The journalist did not detail how this man was making sense of the unexpected and unprecedented event, but we do know why Karl von Müller, the Emden’s 41-year-old captain, carried out the attack.2 Von Müller reported that he bombarded Madras ‘as a demonstration to arouse interest among the Indian population, to disturb English commerce, to diminish English prestige’. His aim was to destroy British property but spare Indian lives. He decided to target the Burmah Oil Company tanks because the Emden’s gunners could fire at them while minimising injury to civilians in a city of half a million inhabitants. The German raid destroyed two fuel tanks holding 346,000 gallons (some 1.5 million litres) of kerosene worth 180,700 rupees, but killed only five men – a Burmah Oil security guard, three Indian policemen, and a British merchant sailor in the Chupra moored in the harbour – and wounded only 12 people: Indian women and men and British men.3\n\nFig. 1.1 Pre-war postcard of Seiner Majestät Schiff (His Majesty’s Ship) Emden, one of the warships of the German East Asian Squadron based at Tsingtao in northern China. From September to November 1914, Captain Karl von Müller’s cruiser captured 24 merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, shutting down trade with disastrous effects for the Indian economy. Image: Sea Power Centre – Australia.\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n11\n\nThe success of the raid on Madras led the German Foreign Office to propose that the Emden’s next exploit should be to liberate two radical Indian nationalists, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Hemchandra Kanungo Das, imprisoned in an isolated penal colony for violent acts against British authority, and secretly return them to India to lead an armed revolt. However, the difficulties in successfully carrying out such an elaborate scheme meant it was soon abandoned.4 There would be no rebellion in India in 1914, but the Emden’s raid was certainly seen by many Indians as a blow to British prestige. The day following the attack on Madras, thousands of the city’s inhabitants went to the shoreline to observe the flames rising from the burning fuel tanks and spent the day looking out to sea in the hope of seeing the Emden, an indication they did not fear the German warship’s return. In the Province of Bihar and Orissa, just to the west of Bengal, it was pointed out that ‘[t]he little cruiser’s raid [. . .] did not pass unnoticed even among the classes which might not be supposed ordinarily to regard the war as a personal affair’. The Calcutta Statesman warned of ‘quite unnecessary but mischievous panic’ unless the Government of India was ‘able to reassure the public and are aided in their efforts by the leaders of Indian opinion’. In the inland Bengali town of Purulia the Emden’s attack led to a run on the local savings bank. In Rangoon (now Yangon, Myanmar), W.H. Barton, proprietor and publisher of the Times of Burma, believed that the attitude towards the British ‘among the native residents in the quarter where his office was situated’ had declined so much that he deemed it necessary to break censorship regulations – for which he would face court and plead guilty – and ‘published information regarding the dispositions of one of His Majesty’s ships and also with reference to the pursuit of the Emden’ in an attempt to salvage the reputation of the British administration.5 The Emden’s presence in the Bay of Bengal had a disastrous effect on the Indian economy. Within hours of the attack on Madras, British authorities closed the Bay of Bengal to merchant traffic. Indian trade in September 1914 was 44 per cent lower than September 1913; in October, trade would be 61 per cent down on the same month the previous year. Ships clogged the ports. In Colombo in Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), the harbour filled to capacity and 15 merchant ships had to be anchored outside the breakwater. Marwari financiers, who provided short-term loans to Indian importers,\n\n12\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nhad no business. They abandoned the eastern ports of Calcutta and Madras (Kolkata and Chennai) to wait out ‘the slack time’ at their homes in the western princely states of Rajputana.6 The halt to shipping in the Bay of Bengal had a devastating effect on trade of all kinds. Most serious was the effect on jute, India’s highestearning export. Mostly grown in Bengal, 90 per cent of the crop was exported either as raw jute or as fabric – called gunny – for bags and sacks to hold wheat and other commodities. In the 1913/14 financial year there were 64 jute mills, mostly in Calcutta, with over 36,000 looms and employing a daily average of 216,000 workers. Jute exports to the United Kingdom alone were worth £10 million.7 The war began just as the jute harvest commenced in Bengal. Australian wheat farmers needed gunny to arrive in Australia in September for wheat bags to be manufactured in Sydney, Melbourne and other cities in time for the harvest at the end of the year. However, the merchant ships allocated for this cargo had been requisitioned in August by the Government of India to transport Indian soldiers westwards to Europe and other locations. In early September, the Calcutta Capital noted that jute bags were ‘accumulating to an enormous extent’ in the city and warned: If this condition continues much longer it means curtailing pro­ duction, as it will be absurd to manufacture goods which cannot be delivered. The attendant evils, such as short time, which would reduce the consumption of jute, and the possible closure of mills, which would throw labour out of employment and make for discontent and distress.8\n\nWhen the Emden’s raid shut down shipping in the Bay of Bengal in late September, Calcutta jute mill owners did not cut production and lay off workers. Instead, they increased production, keeping their factories working six days a week rather than the usual five. The Calcutta Capital commented on 8 October: ‘[e]ven to the man in the street it seems a suicidal policy for mills here to increase their production when the bulk of it is going into their goods godowns’. No reason for keeping jute manufacture at such high levels was provided. There had been industrial disputes in the jute mills in August, and it may have been that the mill owners feared that sacking large\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n13\n\nnumbers of workers in the atmosphere created by the Emden’s incursion would lead to protests and riots.9 The shipment of jute fabric from India to Australia, having been postponed in August because of the Indian Expeditionary Force convoys, was again delayed in September due to the Emden. Australian buyers invoked the clauses in their contracts to cancel their purchases. Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India, sent a telegram on 14 October to Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, the Australian governor-general, pointing out the ‘present stagnation of trade at Calcutta and shipping crisis caused by raids of Emden’ and pleading to Australian businessmen to keep to their contracts and wait for shipping to be resumed. W. Freeman Nott, Secretary of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, replied that wheat farmers required that the ‘bags shall be to hand at a certain season of the year, and unless they are promptly received, the season itself is lost’. Frederick Winchcombe, his equivalent in Sydney, simply stated ‘it will be impossible’ to meet the viceroy’s request.10 Why was there a German warship off the coast of India in the second month of World War I? It must be remembered that in 1914 Germany had a small colonial empire scattered across Africa, the Pacific Ocean and China (it would lose all these colonies at the end of the war). This empire consisted of Togo and Kamerun (Cameroon) in West Africa, South West Africa (Namibia) and German East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi and mainland Tanzania); German New Guinea (Papua New Guinea), Samoa and Nauru in the South Pacific; the Karolinen (Caroline), Marshall and Marianen (Marianas) Islands in the North Pacific; and the northern China enclave of Kiautchou ( Jiaochow).11 The Emden was based in Tsingtao (Qingdao), the main city in Kiautchou, and home port of the German Navy’s East Asian Squadron. This consisted of the light cruisers Emden, Leipzig and Nürnberg and the large armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August, the Emden was the only German cruiser at Tsingtao. It departed the next day to join the rest of the squadron, which had been undertaking its annual tour of the German Pacific island colonies, and arrived eight days later at Pagan in the Marianen Islands. On 13 August, Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, the squadron commander, held a conference of his captains to decide on a strategy for their wartime\n\n14\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\noperations. German naval planning for a war with the British Empire had envisaged that the East Asian Squadron would conduct a campaign of economic warfare by attacking merchant ships carrying Australian exports to the United Kingdom, such as wool – necessary for making military uniforms – and wheat – vital to sustain a British population reliant on imported food.12 Von Spee decided that his cruisers could not implement this plan. This was because eight months previously, in October 1913, the battlecruiser Australia, flagship of the newly created Royal Australian Navy, with its brand new supporting cruisers and destroyers, had arrived in Sydney. The Australia was newer, faster and had larger guns than the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. As von Spee wrote in a letter to his wife Margareta on 18 August: ‘The English Australian Squadron has as flagship the “Australia”, which alone for the Cruiser Squadron is such a superior opponent that it must be avoided.’ Von Spee was also anxious to distance himself from the Japanese Navy, which had two modern battlecruisers, the Ibuki and Kurama. Japan had a treaty of alliance with Britain, and would declare war on Germany on 23 August. The German admiral therefore decided the entire squadron should sail eastwards across the Pacific Ocean, away from Australia and Japan, and operate off South America, where his ships could be resupplied with coal from neutral Chile. Von Müller disagreed with von Spee’s plan. He conceded that it would be impossible to operate all the German ships off East Asia, Australia or India, but argued that deploying one light cruiser in the Indian Ocean would have economic effects on shipping and political effects in India. The other captains and officers supported the idea, and von Spee directed von Müller to sail the Emden and the collier Markomannia to the Indian Ocean to attack merchant shipping ‘as best you can’. That evening all the German ships departed Pagan. The next morning, Emden and Markomannia left the convoy and headed for the Indian Ocean. The East Asian Cruiser Squadron sailed towards the coast of Chile, where, on 1 November, it fought and defeated some obsolete British cruisers at the Battle of Coronel. Von Spee then sailed around Cape Horn into the South Atlantic where, on 8 December, he and his ships confronted two modern British battlecruisers, the Invincible and the Inflexible, and six smaller warships in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. The Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Leipzig and\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n15\n\nNürnberg were outgunned and outnumbered and all were sunk (the cruiser Dresden, which had joined the squadron from deployment off Mexico, was the only German ship to survive the battle). Von Spee and hundreds of his sailors were killed in the battle.13 As the East Asian Squadron headed towards South America, the Emden and its collier journeyed unnoticed across the Pacific Ocean, and threaded their way through the islands of the neutral Netherlands East Indies (modern Indonesia). On 5 September, the two German ships entered the Indian Ocean north of Sumatra. Von Müller set a course to intersect the major Colombo–Calcutta shipping route in the Bay of Bengal just south of Madras. On 9 September, the German light cruiser began a six-week campaign which would result in the capture of 24 merchant ships with a combined gross tonnage of over 100,000, carrying cargoes worth £2.2 million.14 Why was the Emden able to cause so much physical damage and economic dislocation in India and its adjacent waters? Across the British Empire, people were at a loss to explain the German cruiser’s string of successes. The London Times’ naval correspondent speculated that Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was using the new technology of radio to directly control the movements of the Emden half a world away: The notion of Berlin being able to direct operations at such a distance is almost uncanny. If they do so, no more striking exhibition of the use of wireless in naval war could well be imagined. We may picture Von Tirpitz in his office in Berlin. He receives news of the situation in the Bay of Bengal and realizes the opportunity for a little coup. There is a cruiser a few miles away which has been carefully hidden until some such chance presented itself. He calls her up and gives information and orders. The raider does the rest.15\n\nIt is true that Germany did have a worldwide network of radio stations in 1914, but the secret of the Emden’s success was much simpler. It was based on three factors. First, there were at this time few Royal Navy warships in the Bay of Bengal and eastern Indian Ocean to trouble the German light cruiser: they were mostly in the western Indian Ocean escorting troopships from Bombay (modern Mumbai) towards Europe, Egypt and East Africa.\n\n16\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nSecond, the Indian Ocean’s geography aided the Emden in finding prey: ships sailing towards the Bay of Bengal or Southeast and East Asia had to converge to the west of India at either the Eight Degree or Nine Degree channels, above and below Minikoi (Minicoy) Island, and at Dondra Head, on the southern tip of Ceylon. The Admiralty did warn merchant ship captains to keep away from the normal route where it was possible to do so, but most captains kept their ships on the usual track, or within a few miles of it, in order to save fuel and time. Third, most merchant ships in this period were coal-powered and their funnels belched big black clouds of smoke that were visible at some distance. All von Müller had to do to capture British ships was put a man in the Emden’s crow’s nest, where, in clear weather, he could see for 30 miles (some 50 kilometres), sail in a zigzag pattern to 30 miles each side of the shipping route, and head towards smoke whenever it was seen on the horizon.16 The Emden began its campaign against British shipping in the Indian Ocean on the night of 9 September when it stopped the Greek steamer Pontoporos in the Bay of Bengal. Greece was at this time neutral, but the Pontoporos was carrying 6,600 tons of Bengal coal on a British government contract, so its cargo was a legitimate target for the German warship. Von Müller put an officer and some sailors aboard to supervise the Greek crew and had the ship follow the Emden and Markomannia. On 10 and 11 September, the Emden captured the Indus and then the Lovat. Both ships were sailing in ballast (without passengers or cargo) from Calcutta to Bombay, where they were to join a convoy carrying Indian soldiers and horses to the war. The master of the Indus, H.S. Smaridge, became the first, but not the last, British merchant ship captain who assumed the Emden was a British warship right up to the moment that he realised the sailors boarding his ship were wearing German uniforms. The crews of the Indus and the Lovat were transferred to the Markomannia and both ships were sunk.17 On 12 September, von Müller halted the Kabinga, but on finding its cargo was bound for the neutral United States, he could not sink the ship. Instead, he ordered it to accompany the Emden for the moment. On 13 September the Germans came across the Killin, carrying 6,000 tons of Bengal coal, the Diplomat, carrying 10,000 tons of tea, worth £250,000, and the Trabboch, sailing in ballast. All three ships were sunk.18\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n17\n\nThe Emden also stopped the neutral Italian merchant ship Loredano. Von Müller asked Captain Giacopolo to accept the crews and passengers of the ships he had captured and take them to Calcutta. The Italian captain refused and continued his journey. Von Müller then transferred all his temporary captives to the Kabinga and ordered the captain to sail to Calcutta. When the Loredano approached Calcutta, Captain Giacopolo sighted the City of Rangoon sailing towards him, at the commencement of its voyage, and sent a message by semaphore that there was a German cruiser in the Bay of Bengal. The City of Rangoon had a radio – still a rarity for merchant ships at this time – and broadcast the Italian captain’s information. On receiving this alarming news, the Royal Navy immediately shut down all shipping in the Bay of Bengal.19 Ships that had left port were still in danger from the Emden’s depredations. Just before midnight on 14 September, Arthur Bray, Third Officer on the Clan Matheson, sailing from Madras to Calcutta, heard the sound of two warning shots aimed behind the stern of the ship. A radio message in Morse code ordered the captain, William Harris, to stop the ship. Harris had been informed in Madras that the Bay of Bengal was safe and the Clan Matheson was sailing with full lights.20 A second Morse message told the captain to receive a boat from the warship. As Bray later wrote in a letter to his mother: we never thought for an instant that she was anything but British so we got a ladder & cluster light over side for the boat, which presently came alongside with some 20 men & 3 officers all armed to the teeth. As soon as I saw the sailors caps I knew they were Germans, so I shouted down & told the skipper who was on the lower bridge. All he said was ‘My God’.21\n\nThe Emden’s sailors ordered the Clan Matheson’s crew to collect their personal possessions and depart the ship for the Markomannia. The Clan Matheson was carrying a cargo worth £8,725 including locomotives, cars and a racehorse. A German sailor euthanised the unfortunate creature with a single shot to the head before the ship was sunk in the early hours of 15 September.22\n\n18\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nBray found the Germans did as much as was possible to make him and his shipmates comfortable during their confinement on the Markomannia. Von Müller sailed his flotilla to the vicinity of Rangoon, where the Emden took on coal from the Pontoporos, the Greek ship carrying Bengal coal on a British contract, which had been the Emden’s first prize. Von Müller paid Indian sailors from the Clan Matheson to assist with the dirty and exhausting task of re-coaling at sea. He then ordered the Pontoporos to head for a certain point off Sumatra in the neutral Netherlands East Indies for a future rendezvous. On 17 September, the Emden came across the neutral Norwegian ship Dovre and put the Clan Matheson’s crew aboard it. They reached Rangoon on 19 September.23 Bray was enraged by the Emden’s audacity. He wrote: It is a disgrace that a light cruiser like she is should be allowed to do what she did 20 miles off the Indian coast & right up at the head of the Bay of Bengal & then drop us off 20 miles off the mouth of the Rangoon River & get off scot free.24\n\nOn 22 September British authorities reopened the Calcutta–Colombo route because the Emden had not been sighted for some days. That evening von Müller bombarded Madras, and the Bay of Bengal was once more shut down for shipping.25 The Emden sailed southwards to Ceylon to resume attacks on British shipping in a new location. On 25 September the Emden sank the King Lud, sailing in ballast off Galle, the Tymeric, carrying £60,000 worth of sugar from Java for Britain off Colombo, and on 26 September stopped and retained the Gryfevale, sailing in ballast, where the Bombay and Aden routes to Colombo converged, to hold the two ships’ crews detained the previous day.26 On 27 September, the Emden captured three ships near Minikoi Island, on the route to and from the Suez Canal. Two ships, the Ribera and Foyle, were sailing in ballast and were sunk. The third was carrying what would be the Emden’s most mundane, but most important prize. This was the Buresk, a Burdick & Cook collier chartered by the Admiralty to carry 6,600 tons of South Wales coal for the Royal Navy at Singapore.27 As Colonel Hubert Foster, the Director of Military Science at Sydney University, explained:\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n19\n\n‘Cardiff coal’ [. . .] is superior in steam production and smokelessness to any other. It thus gives warships using it the advantages of greater speed and secrecy of movement, with less work on board, as it is hard, clean, free-burning, and leaves little ash or clinker.28\n\nThe significance for the Emden’s crew was that the Bengal coal from the Pontoporos they had previously been using was 35 per cent less efficient than the South Wales coal they had just acquired.29 Von Müller placed the captured merchant seamen on the Gryfevale, which set a course for Colombo. The Emden, accompanied by the Markomannia and the Buresk, headed south to the Maldive Islands. On 29 September the Emden was coaled at a secluded atoll for the last time from the Markomannia, whose supplies were almost expended. The faithful collier was then sent to join the Pontoporos off Sumatra, with orders to take as much of the Bengal coal as it could from this ship, and then allow the Greek ship and its crew to go free. On 12 October this coaling was taking place when the British light cruiser Yarmouth came across the two ships. The Markomannia was captured and sunk, the 60 German sailors became prisoners of war and the men of the Pontoporos, once more at liberty, sailed for Singapore. After bidding farewell to the Markomannia, von Müller sailed south from the Maldives to the Chagos Archipelago. These islands lay across a straight line drawn between Australia and Aden. The German captain expected to find ships carrying refrigerated Australian meat to Britain, and troopships that, having conveyed Indian Army units, would now be sailing to Australia and New Zealand to embark their expeditionary forces. What von Müller did not realise was that the main Australian shipping route did not go direct to Aden, but via Colombo, and therefore the track he was seeking was further to the north. After several fruitless days, in which he did not see a single ship, von Müller continued southwards to Diego Garcia, the main island of the Chagos Archipelago, a dependency of the British colony of Mauritius.30 On 9 October the Emden and the Buresk arrived at Diego Garcia, described in the Colonial Office List as a coral atoll ‘nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter’. The only regular shipping service to the island was a schooner that came\n\n20\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nevery three months: the last time the ship had visited was in late July. This meant that the 500 islanders did not know that Britain and Germany were at war. Von Müller naturally ensured that the locals remained in ignorance of this fact.31 The life of a sailor on the Emden, or any other Great War warship, consisted of an endless cycle of physical labour in an austere environment. The Emden was coal-powered, so one of the main tasks for the crew during their brief stay in Diego Garcia was to shift 475 tons of the Buresk’s precious South Wales coal to the Emden. The other major job was to scour the ship’s hull of the marine plants and animals that had accumulated over the previous eight weeks. If not removed, these growths would reduce the Emden’s maximum speed by one knot. 32 The German sailors also had to endure shortages of a wide range of items. Fresh water, as Dan van der Vat put it, ‘was treated like gold’. The Emden had salt-water showers on deck for relief from the tropical heat, but sailors longed to wash in fresh water. This meant: Whenever a rain-squall was sighted and circumstances allowed, the officers of the watch would step up speed and steer for it while all those free to do so would strip naked and wash themselves in the rainfall; if the ship ran out of the squall or the rain simply stopped too soon, men would be caught covered in soap.33\n\nWhen the Emden left Tsingtao after receiving news of the British declaration of war, soap was one important item that had been forgotten in the rush to prepare the ship for departure. Fortunately for the sailors, this deficiency was rectified on 10 September when the German cruiser captured the Indus carrying 150 cases of soap.34 Fresh food was another treasured item on ships lacking refrigeration. Many of the vessels the Emden captured had chickens, ducks, geese, cattle, sheep or pigs on board to provide fresh eggs, or to be slaughtered for fresh meat. In 1914 one third of the German population was engaged in agriculture, so enough of the Emden’s crew knew how to tend livestock and keep fowl. While at Diego Garcia, the crew caught fish in the atoll, while the local residents gave the visitors fruit, vegetables, and a live pig.35\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n21\n\nThe next day, the Emden and the Buresk departed from Diego Garcia, the sailors having made the most of their brief opportunity to be on dry land for the first time in two months. The two ships headed north; the Emden took more coal from the Buresk in the Maldive Islands, and returned to the major shipping route near Minikoi Island.36 In the early morning darkness of 16 October the Emden stopped the Clan Grant, sailing from Glasgow and Liverpool to Madras and Calcutta. This was followed through the day by the Ponrabbel, a dredger going to Australia to take up duties in the port of Launceston in northern Tasmania, and the Benmohr, travelling from Leith to Yokohama. The crews were moved to the Buresk and the ships were sunk. Two days later the Emden captured the Blue Funnel Line Troilus on its maiden voyage carrying 1,000 tons of Malayan tin as well as rubber and copper with an insured value of £130,000. Later that day came the St Egbert with a cargo for the neutral United States. On 19 October the Emden captured the Exford, carrying South Wales coal to Hong Kong under Admiralty contract for the Royal Navy, and the Chilkana bound for Calcutta. The nearly 600 captured crew and passengers from the seven ships were transferred to the St Egbert, except for 12 Chinese sailors who accepted a German offer to continue working in the Exford for their existing pay rate. The St Egbert set sail for Cochin in India, von Müller retained the Exford and its Welsh coal, and sank the Troilus and the Chilkana.37 The Emden now sailed to Penang on the west coast of Malaya. Von Müller had learned that warships of the various allied navies were using the port. There were no large guns or forts defending Penang, which made it possible for him to plan an audacious raid. The Emden, which had been painted dark grey and had a dummy fourth funnel made of wood and canvas erected so it would resemble a Royal Navy cruiser, entered the port on 28 October at 5.00 am. The Germans began firing their guns and launched a torpedo at the old Russian light cruiser Zhemchug. The Russian sailors had only a handful of shells on deck and barely fired a shot at the German cruiser. A British merchant seaman, W.M. Meager was in the Nigaristan, one of a row of merchant ships moored near the Zhemchug, when he was awoken by the gunfire and raced up on deck. He wrote: ‘For the next 15 minutes we saw an actual Hell on Earth, in which were embodied the extremes of many emotions – desperate bravery, exaltation, hate, despair\n\n22\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nand terror. Of mercy there was none.’ After sailing past the merchant ships and turning to head out of the harbour, at 5.28 am von Müller ordered a second torpedo to be fired at the Zhemchug.38 Meager witnessed the result: When the ‘Emden’ was nearly abeam of her victim, the final catastrophe happened. Suddenly from the forepart of the Russian an intensely riven column of light spurted up to a great height, spreading out towards the top. It vanished in a second, and was followed by a dull muffled report. (Not a bit loud, as one would imagine). Immediately a great cloud of dense smoke mercifully covered the horror from our sight. For a brief space there was an awesome silence followed by wild cheering on the German ship. It was terrible to listen to the Germans cheering at the death cries of their fellow men – for which they were responsible.39\n\nOf the 340 Russian sailors and officers of the Zhemchug, 86 were killed and 114 were wounded – five of whom would subsequently die of their injuries. The Penang General Hospital was overwhelmed by the large number of casualties. Seven local doctors and 27 female volunteers worked desperately to dress the wounds of every wounded Russian sailor.40 The Emden, as it left Penang, stopped the merchant ship Glenturret carrying a cargo of ammunition with the intention of capturing it. The German plan was aborted by the approach of the French destroyer Mousquet. The larger guns of the German cruiser sank the smaller French destroyer within seven minutes. Von Müller sent out two boats that rescued 36 sailors from the Mousquet. These remained on the Emden until 30 October, when von Müller halted the British merchant ship Newburn, found it was carrying a neutral cargo, and transferred the French sailors to the ship so they could be taken to nearby Sabang in Sumatra to receive full medical treatment.41 On 31 October the Emden met with the Buresk off Sumatra and took on more coal. Von Müller decided that his next foray would be to attack merchant shipping in the western Indian Ocean near Aden and the Red Sea entry to the Suez Canal. Before doing so, he would first go to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to destroy the radio station and cut the telegraph cable linking Australia to Britain. Severing these vital communication\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n23\n\nlinks would seriously affect the British Empire war effort. The Nürnberg, one of the Emden’s sister ships in the East Asian Squadron, had cut the telegraph cable connecting Australia to Canada at Fanning Island in the Pacific Ocean on 7 September 1914, and the link would not be restored until 1 November. Von Müller also believed the Emden’s appearance at the Cocos Islands would lead the British to assume the cruiser was intending to attack shipping in Australian waters and force them to spread their resources by deploying warships in this region. The German captain had already ordered the Exford, captured on 19 October and carrying South Wales coal, to wait for him just north of the Cocos Islands.42 So far, von Müller had been able to avoid British warships because the Royal Navy’s East Indian Squadron was fully occupied in the western Indian Ocean escorting convoys carrying over 100,000 Indian troops to Europe, Egypt, East Africa and Basra in Mesopotamia (Iraq). The Emden’s sister ship Königsberg, based in German East Africa, posed a threat to the safe passage of all these convoys, as it demonstrated on 20 September, when it made a sortie to the nearby British protectorate of Zanzibar and sank the old British cruiser Pegasus. Each convoy therefore required an escort of warships, at least one of which had to be capable of defeating the Königsberg.43 The Government of India’s inept actions had also assisted the Emden’s campaign. The Bay of Bengal had been closed to shipping after the raid on Madras, but authorities reopened all routes in the Bay of Bengal and to Colombo, Bombay and Karachi on 2 October even though they did not know the cruiser’s location. The immediate outpouring of shipping from Calcutta and Colombo was immediately followed by the Emden’s capturing seven ships in three days off Ceylon. According to the Times of India, merchants complained, ‘not because the Emden has not been captured but because the shippers have been misled into believing the routes safe’. When the cruiser Hampshire was transferred from the China Station to operate in Indian waters, its commander, Captain Henry Grant, had to tell the Government of India to stop sending him uncoded radio messages because the Emden could also hear them and use the information to avoid Grant’s ship.44 The exploits of the Emden affected individuals across the British Empire beyond India. In Canada, New Zealand and Australia, von Müller’s cruiser evoked fears for the safety of the convoys carrying their soldiers to war. Two\n\n24\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\ndays before the departure of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), Joseph Pope, the senior civil servant in the Department of External Affairs, expressed his concern to his son that ‘a number of German Cruisers [. . .] would scour the North Atlantic and attack Canada as the Emden is at present attacking our possessions, ships and Commerce in the far East’. Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden made a last-minute request to the British government to provide a larger naval escort for the CEF convoy that sailed on 3 October. When German submarines were sighted off the English south coast, the Canadian troopships had to be diverted on 14 October to the closest port of Plymouth.45 The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) convoy of ten ships was originally to have sailed in late September from Wellington to the Western Australian port of Albany escorted by three obsolete Pelorus-class cruisers. However, when von Spee’s Cruiser Squadron appeared in the South Pacific off Samoa on 14 September and bombarded Papeete in the French colony of Tahiti on 22 September, the New Zealand government became justifiably concerned for the convoy’s security. On 2 October, Prime Minister William Massey wrote to his Australian counterpart, Andrew Fisher, that he and his Cabinet ‘have felt a great deal of anxiety here with regard to the escort of the ships’. The Admiralty decided that the risk of the German squadron attacking the convoy meant that the NZEF transports required the escort of two modern cruisers, the British Minotaur and the Japanese Ibuki. When this decision was made, these ships were in the Indian Ocean searching for the Emden, and it would take them some time to sail to New Zealand. Lord Liverpool, the New Zealand Governor-General, believed the seriousness of the war situation meant the convoy needed to depart immediately. On 4 October, Liverpool made the extraordinary proposal to the government that he should – in his (ceremonial) role as Commander-in-Chief of the New Zealand military forces – take responsibility for making the decision for the convoy to sail before the British and Japanese cruisers arrived. Massey was aghast at the idea and threatened to resign as prime minister. Liverpool backed down. It was not until 16 October that the NZEF convoy, escorted by the Ibuki and Minotaur, left Wellington.46 The departure of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) convoy led to a dispute between the Australian government and the AIF commander, Brigadier General William Bridges. Following the recommendations of a\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n25\n\n1910 Committee of Imperial Defence report on the wartime transport of troops, which assumed British command of the sea, Bridges rejected the use of convoys and planned to send each ship individually, beginning with the slow-moving horse transports. Senator George Pearce, the Australian Defence Minister, however, took Admiralty advice and gained Cabinet agreement to delay the ships’ departure until the Ibuki and Minotaur arrived with the NZEF convoy. Bridges told Pearce on 26 September that his decision was wrong, that there was little chance of German warships attacking the transports and that ‘delay is in this, as in most, military operations, more dangerous than action’. The fear of the German cruisers was endemic among Australian decision-makers. Arthur Jose, Australian correspondent for the London Times, later wrote that Prime Minister Fisher ‘had conjured up a picture of thirty thousand young untried men afloat, of enemy cruisers dashing in to sink them, of Australia, unused to war, shocked and angered’. Rear Admiral Sir William Creswell, the senior officer of the Royal Australian Navy, wrote on 26 October of the ‘terrible damage’ the Emden could do ‘diving into a mass of 40 transports on a dark night’. It was therefore with some trepidation that the ten New Zealand and 28 Australian transports escorted by the British Minotaur, Japanese Ibuki and Australian Sydney and Melbourne sailed from Albany on 1 November.47 By the time the Australian and New Zealand convoy departed, Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, had far more naval resources at his disposal than when the Emden had commenced its campaign in early September. With the Japanese declaration of war, the Ibuki and Chikuma had been deployed to Singapore. After the Emden’s raid on Penang, Jerram was able to request more Japanese warships to search for the German cruiser in the Netherlands East Indies. Once the task of escorting the Indian Army convoys had been completed, British warships returned to the Bay of Bengal. In addition, four passenger ships in Hong Kong, the Empress of Asia, Empress of Japan, Empress of Russia and Himalaya had been taken over by the Admiralty on the outbreak of war and converted into Armed Merchant Cruisers. On 27 October, Admiral Sir Henry Jackson, Chief of Staff to Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, told his minister ‘we are now starting a systematic hunt’ for the Emden ‘which will either bring her to destruction or more probably drive her into some other less dangerous theatre of operations’.48\n\n26\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Steamships’ Empress of Asia, which in peacetime sailed the Hong Kong–Vancouver route, was now armed with eight 4.7-inch (120-millimetre) guns manned by 20 artillerymen, including 22-year-old Gunner Edgar Mole who was stationed in Hong Kong with the Royal Garrison Artillery. Twenty-five sepoys from the 40th Pathans Regiment were also embarked to carry the ammunition to the guns. In August and September, the Empress of Asia patrolled between Hong Kong and Singapore. In October the ship sailed to Ceylon to operate in the Indian Ocean. Here, the Chinese stokers suffered an astonishing death rate: six died in ten days. On 8 October the Empress of Asia left Colombo, rendezvoused with the Hampshire and ‘went scouting for the Emden’. The two ships sailed south and arrived at Diego Garcia on 15 October. Mole was a member of the party sent ashore. They questioned one of the islanders who told them of the Emden’s recent visit. Mole noted in his diary: ‘They did not even know there was a war on and they only laughed at us when we told them.’49 On 8 November the Emden and the Buresk rendezvoused with the collier Exford just north of the Cocos Islands. The following morning the staff at the radio and cable station on Direction Island saw a ship sailing towards them. Realising that the Emden’s canvas fourth funnel was a fake and that it was a German warship, they immediately sent out a radio message that was received by the Melbourne, which was escorting the Australian and New Zealand convoy and was only 50 miles (80 kilometres) away. Captain Mortimer Silver in the Melbourne ordered Captain John Glossop in the Sydney to go to the islands to investigate, while the other warships remained to protect the convoy in case the Emden was accompanied by the Königsberg.50 As soon as von Müller realised there was a cruiser approaching, he took the Emden out to sea, abandoning the landing party who had brought down the radio mast and cut the telegraph cable to Australia. (These men would escape the islands on the schooner Ayesha and return to Germany by way of the Ottoman Empire.) Then began what the British naval historian Julian Corbett described as the ‘unequal’ battle between the Sydney and the Emden. The Sydney was newer, larger and faster than the Emden. The Australian cruiser’s 6-inch (152-millimetre) guns with shells weighing 100 pounds (45 kilograms) had longer range and more destructive effect\n\n1914: the Emden in the indian ocean\n\n27\n\nthan the German cruiser’s 4.1-inch (105 millimetre) guns with shells weighing 38 pounds (16 kilograms). The Emden’s only chance for survival was to get in close to the Sydney, inflict early damage to slow down its foe and launch a torpedo to sink the Australian cruiser. Von Müller fired his guns first at 9.40 am, catching Glossop by surprise. The first salvo had the range of the Sydney; the second salvo hit its target. Fifteen German shells hit the Sydney, but only half exploded and none did major damage. Glossop manoeuvred the Sydney beyond the range of the Emden’s guns. Once the Sydney’s gunners found the range of the German cruiser at 9.50 am, they systematically wreaked destruction on the Emden and its men: at 11.20 von Müller ran the Emden onto a coral reef to save his crew. By this stage, the Emden was, as Able Seaman Richard Broome in the Sydney wrote in his diary, ‘a total wreck, on fire from the bridge to the stern, all three funnels, foremast & bridge gone, all her guns silent’. Of the 316 men aboard the Emden, 134 were killed in the encounter or subsequently died of wounds and 65 were wounded. The Sydney’s casualties were four killed or died of wounds and 11 wounded. Von Müller survived the battle unharmed. Glossop next went in pursuit of the Buresk: the German crew scuttled the collier and were then brought aboard the Sydney. That evening, Jerram ordered the Empress of Asia to depart from Colombo and sail at full steam and with no lights to the Cocos Islands. Mole wrote in his diary that the ship’s engineers ‘were standing over the Chinese stokers with loaded revolvers so as to keep them at work’. When the Empress of Asia reached the islands, Mole and the other British and Indian soldiers were sent ashore in a vain search for any fugitive German sailors.51 The battle between the Emden and the Sydney had been brutal and lethal. Its aftermath, however, was more in accordance with peacetime ideas of gentlemanly behaviour. Von Müller had gained the respect of the British because of his impeccable behaviour towards captured sailors and passengers. When Mole had gone on leave in Colombo in October, he ‘met several seamen whose vessels had been sunk by the Emden. They were treated well and gave the captain a good name.’52 Glossop sent a radio message to Ceylon stating that the Sydney should not be cheered went it sailed into Colombo out of respect to the wounded German sailors now on board the Australian cruiser. When King George V\n\n28\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nFig. 1.2 His Majesty’s Australian Ship Sydney, commanded by Captain John Glossop, defeated the Emden at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 9 November 1914. Glossop told the naval authorities in Ceylon that his ship should not be cheered when it entered Colombo harbour out of respect for the surviving German sailors. Image: Sea Power Centre – Australia.\n\nwas informed of the defeat of the Emden, his immediate response was to enquire whether von Müller and Prince Franz Joseph von Hohenzollern, an officer on the Emden and distant relative to the British royal family, had survived the battle. Churchill instructed that the Emden survivors were ‘entitled to all the honours of war’, and all officers ‘should be permitted to retain swords’.53 The Times of India commented on 14 November that the destruction of the Emden ‘has caused wide-spread satisfaction’ and predicted a revival in Indian business confidence. Large parts of the Indian economy would continue to be adversely affected by the war. However, jute overcame the difficulties of 1914 to become a commodity that remained in high demand until the armistice in 1918. On the Western Front, the end of 1914 marked the beginning of trench warfare. Sandbags became essential for constructing trench systems: Indian jute mills would manufacture 1.4 billion sandbags over the next four years.54\n\n2\n\nShipping, Trade and Rationing\n\nT\n\nhe Emden had demonstrated how vulnerable the British Empire’s trade and shipping was in wartime. One small German cruiser had shut down all trade in the Bay of Bengal, resulting in economic distress across India and panic in the New Zealand, Canadian and Australian governments, in dread that enemy warships would attack their troop convoys. The economies of every part of the British Empire relied, to a lesser or greater extent, on exporting and importing raw materials and manufactured goods. Most of this trade was carried by sea. The British merchant fleet was the largest in the world in 1914, and was four times larger than its nearest rival Germany’s. Each year British trade required the carrying of over 150 million tons of cargo. There were 287,000 British merchant seamen in 1913: 209,000 white British subjects, 31,000 white non-British subjects and 47,000 non-white sailors of Chinese, Indian and other backgrounds. Racial prejudice determined sailors’ wages: in April 1917 white sailors’ monthly wages ranged from 170 to 200 shillings, but Chinese sailors were paid only 120 to 130 shillings.1 The British tradition of free trade meant the United Kingdom and the various components of the British Empire were as likely to trade with foreign states as they were to trade with other parts of the Empire. In 1913, only one quarter of British and Irish imports came from India, the dominions and colonies, and only one third of British and Irish exports stayed within the Empire.2\n\n30\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nThe 46 million people of the United Kingdom depended on food from overseas for 64 per cent of their calories.3 The extent of the reliance on imports is shown in Table 2.1. TABLE 2.1 UNITED KINGDOM FOOD SUPPLY, 19174 IMPORTED (%)\n\nLOCALLY PRODUCED (%)\n\nCEREALS\n\n79\n\n21\n\nMEAT\n\n40\n\n60\n\nBUTTER\n\n64.5\n\n35.5\n\nCHEESE\n\n80\n\n20\n\nEGGS\n\n50\n\n50\n\n49.5\n\n50.5\n\nVEGETABLES (NOT POTATOES)\n\n36\n\n64\n\nFRUIT\n\n73\n\n27\n\nSUGAR, COCOA, CHOCOLATE\n\n100\n\n0\n\nMARGARINE\n\nThis table understates the British reliance on imports, as a quarter of the fodder for British meat and dairy animals was imported. Equally significant was the trade in commodities. All cotton, silk, oil, rubber, jute and hemp was imported; three quarters of the annual consumption of wool was imported; and around two million tons of timber was shipped each year to provide props for Welsh and English coalmines.5 The United Kingdom traded with Europe where possible because it was closer and therefore quicker and cheaper to transport. Russian wheat shipped through the Black Sea and the Mediterranean was more convenient than wheat from Canada or Australia. Three quarters of British sugar imports in 1913 came from Austria–Hungary and Germany rather than the West Indies and Fiji.6\n\nshipping, trade and rationing\n\n31\n\nAs J.A. Salter would write in 1921, World War I was, for Britain and Germany, ‘a war of competing blockades, the surface and the submarine’. The Germans would implement unrestricted submarine campaigns in an attempt to sink sufficient merchant ships sailing for the United Kingdom that the population would be starved into submission. The Royal Navy established a cordon, enforced by armed merchant ships rather than warships as they were more stable in the often-stormy North Sea, to strangle German imports. British civilians would suffer occasional food shortages, especially in 1917, but hundreds of thousands of German civilians would die from the effects of long-term food scarcity. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George recognised the vital importance of wartime trade soon after he became prime minister in late 1916 when he stated that shipping ‘has never been so vital to the life of the country as it is at present, during the war. It is the jugular vein, which, if severed, will destroy the life of the nation’.7\n\nThe war begins: rationing in British North Borneo North Borneo was a territory of mostly tropical rainforest that the sultans of Brunei and Sulu had granted to the British North Borneo Company in 1881. Its estimated area of 31,000 square miles (80,300 square kilometres) was equivalent to that of Scotland. The United Kingdom government declared the territory (now the Malaysian state of Sabah) a British Protectorate in 1889, and took control of its external relations. Its internal administration, however, remained the responsibility of the seven-member Court of Directors of the British North Borneo Company, based in London. It was the Court of Directors who, with the Colonial Secretary’s approval, appointed the governor. According to the 1911 census, the colony’s population consisted of about 180,000 indigenous people, who mostly practised subsistence nomadic agriculture in the rainforests, and about 30,000 Chinese and 400 Europeans who mostly worked on tobacco and rubber plantations, mined coal at Cowie Harbour and were engaged in a growing trade in exporting timber to northern China.8 Norddeutscher Lloyd, a German shipping company, ran the weekly service from Singapore to British North Borneo that supplied all the food for the European community and half of the rice required by the Chinese\n\n32\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\ncommunity. When the war began, the German ships stopped sailing, and there was an immediate food shortage. Governor Cecil Parr introduced rationing and set a maximum price for rice to prevent profiteering.9 On 5 August 1914, J. West Ridgeway, Chairman of the British North Borneo Court of Directors, warned Sir John Anderson, the senior civil servant in the Colonial Office: North Borneo is in a precarious position as regards food [. . .] The prospect is appalling if the supplies for the Chinese Coolies – all 12000 – is entirely cut off and indeed apart from humanity the consequent catastrophe would [. . .] injure the prestige of the Empire in the East.\n\nAnderson had an intimate knowledge of this part of the world as he had served in Singapore as governor of the Straits Settlements from 1904 to 1911. Ridgeway asked for the Colonial Office to ‘instruct’ Sir Arthur Young, the current governor, ‘to do his utmost’ to remedy the situation.10 The outbreak of war had caused a financial crisis in London, and the British government had imposed controls on the movement of funds outside the United Kingdom. This made it impossible for the British North Borneo Company to purchase food in Singapore and hire a vessel to transport it to North Borneo. Lord Harcourt, the Colonial Secretary, had to provide his personal approval for the Singapore branch of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China to pay £6,000 to the British North Borneo Company ‘in order to meet the food requirements of the inhabitants of British North Borneo’. With this authorisation, the funds were made available and a few days later a ship arrived in North Borneo carrying rice and other foodstuffs to alleviate the shortages.11 A permanent solution was then devised. The North Borneo government’s shipping agents in Singapore, Messrs. Guthrie & Co, and the Straits Settlements government worked together to enable the Straits Steamship Company to take over the Singapore–Borneo run. On 10 September, Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, agreed to requisition three German ships interned in Singapore so the Straits Steamship Company could charter them to service North Borneo.12\n\nshipping, trade and rationing\n\n33\n\nNigeria: palm kernels and shipping cartels It had been relatively simple to solve the shipping problem in the small colony of North Borneo. It would be far more difficult to overcome the effects of the wartime disruption to shipping and trade in Nigeria. This was for three reasons. First, Nigeria was the most populous British colony in Africa with about 17.5 million inhabitants. Second, a significant proportion of the African population, particularly in the south, grew crops such as cotton and cocoa for export to Europe. Third, much of this produce went to Germany on German ships.13 The most important export was the ‘monarch of the Nigerian forest’, the palm kernel that could be crushed to extract palm oil to make a high-quality margarine. About 80 per cent of Nigerian kernels – 131,886 tons, worth £2.4 million in 1913 – went to Hamburg, mostly carried in the ships of the Woermann-Linie group. Only Germany had sufficient specialised crushing plants to process such a large amount of kernels. With the outbreak of war, the market for Nigerian palm kernels collapsed: those landed in Liverpool from August to October 1914 were literally unsaleable.14 R.E. Dennett, Deputy Chief Conservator in the Nigerian Forestry Department, presented a lecture to the Royal Colonial Institute in London on 26 October 1914 entitled ‘The war: British and German trade in Nigeria’ that outlined the three requirements that Nigerian palm kernel producers would need to secure their future. These were: ‘a line of steamers [. . .] to take the place of the German line which had run from Hamburg’; a new ‘great seed-crushing centre [. . .] capable of taking and treating Nigeria’s exports of palm kernels’; and the creation of a British market for ‘palm kernel meal and cake’ – the by-product of the oil extraction process that was used as animal feed.15 The British government immediately recognised that Nigeria’s ‘palm kernel difficulty is a serious one’, and worked with British manufacturers to ensure that Dennett’s second and third propositions were brought into reality. Lord Islington of the Colonial Office met with soap-makers Lever Brothers and the Liverpool and London Chambers of Commerce in August 1914 and discovered that there were only three small mills capable of crushing palm kernels in the entire United Kingdom. Fortunately, soap and margarine manufacturers expressed their willingness to order new\n\n34\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nmachinery and construct large crushing mills. By 1915 Nigerian palm kernels that had previously gone to Germany were now being processed in factories in Liverpool, Hull and London.16 The West African Section of the London Chamber of Commerce issued a report in March 1915 on ‘the question of the Palm Kernel Industry as affected by the War’ which argued that the high cost of establishing new crushing plants meant that markets would need to be found for both palm oil and for crushed palm kernel cake as animal feed. German manufacturers had established a large market for palm kernel cake among European farmers. The small crushing mills in operation in Liverpool in 1914 had sold a small amount of palm kernel cake to Irish farmers, but their main market had been Germany and Scandinavia.17 The campaign to persuade British farmers to purchase palm kernel cake for their stock animals was carried out on two fronts. Professor Wyndham Dunstan, Director of the Imperial Institute in London, successfully lobbied the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to produce a leaflet on palm kernel cakes that was issued in January 1915. This explained that the product was ‘being brought prominently to the notice of stock holders as a result of the war’ because ‘hitherto practically all the palmnut kernels produced in Nigeria and other British Colonies [which] have been exported to Germany [. . .] have now been diverted to the United Kingdom’. Owen Phillips, Chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce, contacted the principals of British agricultural colleges in October 1914, for advice in ‘getting farmers to take an interest in this matter’. Phillips found a general appreciation of ‘the Imperial aspect of the question’ and that 14 colleges had commenced trials to provide information to agriculturalists. He accurately predicted that ‘Palm Kernel Cake will be welcomed by farmers as a new and useful feeding material, as soon as it is made known to them, and is commercially “pushed” ’.18 By 1915, Nigerian palm kernels that had been exported to Germany were now being processed in Britain to make margarine, and British farmers were buying palm kernel cake for animal feed. But what of the third of R.E. Dennett’s recommendations for extra British ships to be put on the West African route to make up for the withdrawal of German hulls? This was never achieved. Nigerians suffered shipping shortages for the duration of the war. At the end of 1915 there were over 300 railway\n\nshipping, trade and rationing\n\n35\n\nwagons clogging Nigerian railway yards loaded with palm kernels awaiting shipment. It is true that this occurred in many parts of the Empire. When Governor-General Sir Frederick Lugard informed Colonial Secretary Andrew Bonar Law of ‘the absence of adequate shipping’ in Nigeria, he acknowledged that his ‘description no doubt does not differ materially from that which reaches you from many, if not most, of the Colonies at the present time’. What made the situation in Nigeria worse, however, was that the removal of the Woermann-Linie group’s ships gave the British Elder Dempster group a virtual monopoly on the West African route. As well as this, the shutting down of German business in Nigeria meant that British trading companies and the French Compagnie Française de l’Afrique Occidentale now controlled the colony’s export trade and formed cartels to use this power to their advantage.19 The colonial administration in Nigeria recognised that indigenous producers and traders had real grievances. Edward Harding in the Colonial Office commented on 1 January 1916: The position is very unsatisfactory, but it is difficult to see what can be done to improve matters. With the disappearance of German firms, there is, it would seem, a real danger of Nigerian trade falling into the hands of a ring of firms powerful enough to crush out opposition and to exploit Nigeria for their own personal profit.20\n\nBoth Elder Dempster and the cartel trading companies made huge profits from Nigerian exports during the war. Elder Dempster used its monopoly position to force a 40 per cent increase in the cost of transporting palm kernels between August 1914 and December 1915. The cartel companies retained their profit despite Elder Dempster’s freight rises because they combined to force down the price that Nigerian producers received for palm kernels and other produce. The pre-war difference between the Lagos price and Liverpool price for palm kernels was between £4 and £5 per ton: in 1916 the difference in prices between Lagos and Liverpool had widened to £13. Palm kernels could be purchased in Nigeria for less than half the British selling price.21 Elder Dempster and the cartel companies colluded to prevent independent traders gaining access to shipping space. Archibald Cooper,\n\n36\n\nsomeone else’s war\n\nGeneral Manager of Nigerian Railways, calculated in October 1916 that the cartel companies received 63 per cent of the available shipping. The remaining 37 per cent was divided between three groups of non-cartel traders: the British Cotton Growing Association (10.5 per cent), European companies (13.5 per cent) and African traders (13 per cent).22 In districts where the independent traders operated alongside the cartel companies, farmers received better prices as there was competition for their produce, but the independent traders found it difficult to get their goods exported. African merchants including Karimu Kotun, T.B. Dawodu and Moses Coker presented a petition to Lugard in July 1916, complaining that Elder Dempster allocated them only 350 tons of the 9,000 tons of available shipping space. In October, Samuel W. Duncan, Managing Director of the newly formed Association of Native Merchants told the governor-general: ‘If we are unable to obtain the tonnage in the only steamers trading with Lagos, it means we are to become the slaves of the Combine or retire from business.’23 While Elder Dempster and the cartel companies amassed their profits, the Nigerian people suffered. The shipping shortage did lead to the development of local industries such as the manufacture of roofing tiles, and the establishment of a furniture factory in Lagos and a coal mine at Udi. However, it also meant the price of imports such as salt, kerosene and textiles increased by between 150 and 300 per cent. Harding in London noted in May 1916 that Nigerian revenue from import duties had fallen due to the ‘reduction of the purchasing power of natives owing to the low prices paid by the ring merchants’. Export duties had to be introduced to raise funds, large infrastructure projects, such as the railway to the inland town of Kaduna, were cancelled, and, as Ayodeji Olukoju has argued, Elder Dempster’s exorbitant freight rates were ‘detrimental’ to Nigerians’ ‘economic interests’.24\n\nIreland: stained glass windows revival The loss of the Hamburg trade had been economically disastrous for Nigeria. In Ireland, however, the halt in German imports enabled the rebirth of the local manufacture of stained glass windows. As the poet William Butler Yeats, as a member of the Irish Free State Senate, would\n\nshipping, trade and rationing\n\n37\n\nlater point out, German mass-produced ‘inferior stained-glass’ dominated the Irish market in 1914. The outbreak of war, however, meant that ‘our Irish stained-glass had not to face that competition’, and Yeats argued that Irish artists demonstrated their ability to create ‘beautiful glass’ that ‘found an exceedingly fine market at home’.25 This artistic renaissance was centred on Sarah Purser’s Dublin studio named, in the Irish language, An Túr Gloine (‘The Tower of Glass’). The artists included in this circle included Purser, Catherine O’Brien, Ethel Rhind, Wilhelmina Geddes, Alfred Ernest Child, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke. In the absence of imported German stained glass, Irish exponents in this craft gained commissions for churches, public buildings and private houses. In February 1916, An Túr Gloine exhibited stained glass windows by Rhind, O’Brien and Healy that the Irish Times praised for their ‘brilliancy and originality’, and the Irish Builder and Engineer published an article outlining the work of the main Irish glass artists. Four months later, Harry Clarke displayed windows of Irish saints that were installed, alongside windows by O’Brien, Rhind and Child, at the Honan Chapel built adjacent to University College"
