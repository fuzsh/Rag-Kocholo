It\n\nis\n\nthis\n\ndramatic scene from the pages of\n\n1942, a year of fate for the\n\nGerman\n\n\"Incredible,\" he muttered to himself, \"absolutely ing.\"\n\nMarshal Fedor von Bock stood\n\njust southeast\n\nat his hilltop\n\nof Lozovaia, shaking his head\n\nat\n\nGerman\n\narmy:\n\noverwhelm-\n\nobservation post,\n\nthe scene.\n\nThe\n\nvista\n\nbeneath him was one that few generals in history had ever been privileged to see: an entire enemy army surrounded in a tiny pocket\n\nfew miles away. He focused his field glasses here, then there, flitting back and forth. The entire area couldn't have been more than two miles wide from east to east, perhaps ten miles from north to south, and every inch of it was seething with activity. Massed formations of dusty brown infantry, tank columns so dense you could probably walk from one vehicle to the other without touching the ground, guns of every shape and description all milling about, moving hither and yon without apparent plan or purpose. Above them thundered hundreds of Luftwaffe ground attack aircraft, Richthofen's boys: Stukas and 109s and Ju-88s, bombing and strafing and herding. With so many men and tanks, guns and horses, packed into such a tight space, they were an impossible-to-miss target. The airmen were probably licking their chops, he thought, and the same went for his gunners. As he surveyed the scene, he could\n\njust a\n\n—\n\nfrom all points of the compass into the helpless, writhing mass below him. There were explosions everywhere; every see artillery firing\n\nsquare inch of the pocket roiled with\n\nfire\n\nand smoke.\n\nHe thought of a term he had learned so many years ago as a cadet in the War Academy: Kesselschlacht, the \"cauldron battle.\" It was the perfect term to describe\n\narmy being boiled\n\nalive.\n\nwhat was going on below: an entire enemy He remembered studying the campaigns of\n\nthe Great Elector, Frederick the Great, Blucher, and Moltke.\n\nThey\n\nwere the gamblers of their day: bold maneuvers, daring attacks from\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nflank and rear, battles of encirclement.\n\nAnd he remembered another\n\nword: Vernichtungsschlacht, the \"battle of annihilation.\" There was a massive explosion in the killing fields below. Bock couldn't know it, but a single 500-pound bomb delivered from a Stuka had just struck a Soviet ammunition convoy. The exploboth primary and secondary had killed or wounded over sions\n\n—\n\n—\n\n300 men. Were those screams he heard? Horses? Men? No matter. He was back to his reverie. He thought once more of those longago classes, the handsome, red-bound books. Der Schlachterfolg, they were called \"Success in Battle.\" They contained the battles and operations of all the great German captains, and they were required reading in the first-year course. The great cavalry commander Seydlitz, slashing across the march route of the hapless French army at Rossbach and destroying it in an hour. Yorck crossing the Elbe River at Wartenburg into the rear of Napoleon's army, the maneuver that trapped the emperor and led directly to his defeat at Leipzig. Hadn't the king given him a new title after that one? Yes, he thought, \"Yorck von Wartenburg.\" Best of all, Moltke's elegant maneuver at Koniggratz, coolly risking the destruction of one army while waiting for another one to slam into the Austrian flank. Bock had long ago memorized the details of every one of these battles, could recite their orders of battle, could still diagram each one on a chalkboard from memory. He was sixty-one, but he felt young again. Not one of those immortal battles, he suddenly realized, could rival what was happening beneath him at this very moment. For ease, for swiftness, for decisiveness, this might be the greatest victory in the history of the German army. \"They'll be adding another name to that list,\" he chuckled. Maybe he'd even get a title, like old Yorck. He chuckled and rolled it from his tongue: \"Fedor von Bock und Kharkov.\" At Marshal Bock's feet, an enemy army was dying.\n\n—\n\nThe\n\nabove scene\n\nmay seem\n\nmeans anything to the means the turning point of\n\nstrange. If 1942\n\ninformed student of World War II, it the war, the year of El Alamein and Stalingrad (and, in the Pacific, the year of Guadalcanal and Midway), the turning of the tide the \"hinge of fate,\" in Winston Churchill's memorable phrase. It was the year in which the German army (the Wehrmacht) died and took German dreams of conquest along with it. But it was also a year that began with no fewer than five of the greatest victories in the long history of German arms: at Kerch, Kharkov, and Sevastopol in the Soviet Union, and 1\n\n—\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nGazala and Tobruk in North Africa. Here the Wehrmacht wrote a new chapter in its already impressive resume of battlefield success. On the strategic level, things had turned sour for Germany in Deat\n\nGermany, already\n\nwar with Great Britain, a conflict that it tried half-heartedly to end in the summer and fall of 1940, had done nothing but add enemies since then. In June 1941, with Britain still unconquered, it had launched Operation Barbarossa, an invasion of the Soviet Union. The early weeks of the campaign had seen the Wehrmacht smash one Soviet army after another: at Bialystok, at Minsk, at Smolensk, and especially at Kiev. As summer turned to fall, Barbarossa became Operation Typhoon, the drive on Moscow. The Germans were within sight of the Soviet capital by December when the Red Army launched a great counteroffensive that drove them back in some confusion. The next day, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and the German Fiihrer, Adolf Hitler, decided to join them in their war on America. Earlier in the year, Germany had been at war with Britain alone. Now, just six months later, it was at war with an immense and wealthy enemy coalition, which Churchill, with a nod to his great ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, dubbed the \"Grand Alli-\n\ncember\n\nance.\"\n\n1941.\n\nat\n\n3\n\nThe Grand\n\nAlliance controlled most of the world's resources. It\n\nincluded the preeminent naval and colonial power (Britain), the largest land power (the Soviet Union), and the globe's financial and industrial giant (the United States)\n\nGermany. Harnessing\n\n—more than enough potential power to smash\n\nthat dominating power, however, proved to be\n\nThe United\n\nhad come into the war with only the barest idea of how it intended to fight it. It would become evident to all concerned that there was a world of difference between potentially beating Germany and actually defeating the Gera difficult thing.\n\nman army on\n\na field\n\nStates, in particular,\n\nof battle.\n\nThe Problem: The German Way of War would prove to be harder than anyone could have imagined. If there was one army in the world that was used to fighting from a position of material inferiority, this was the one. Since the earliest days of the German state, a unique military culture had evolved, a German way of war. Its birthplace was the kingdom of Prus-\n\nPerforming that\n\nsia.\n\nfeat\n\nStarting in the seventeenth century with Frederick William, the\n\nGreat Elector, Prussia's rulers recognized that their small, relatively\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nimpoverished state on the European periphery had to fight wars that 4 were kurtz und vives (short and lively). Crammed into a tight spot in the middle of Europe, surrounded by states that vastly outweighed in terms of\n\nmanpower and\n\nwars of attrition. a\n\nway fast\n\ncould not win long, drawn-out\n\nstart, Prussia's military\n\nproblem was to\n\nfind\n\nended in a decisive battlefield vicstorm against the enemy, pounding\n\nhad to unleash\n\na\n\nand hard.\n\nThe mans\n\nit\n\nto fight short, sharp wars that\n\ntory. Its conflicts it\n\nFrom the\n\nresources,\n\nit\n\nsolution to Prussia's strategic problem was something the Ger-\n\ncalled Bewegungskrieg, the\n\n\"war of movement.\" This way of war\n\nmaneuver on the operational level. It was not simply tactical maneuverability or a faster march rate, but the movement of large units like divisions, corps, and armies. Prussian commanders, and their later German descendants, sought to maneuver these formations in such a way that they could strike the mass of the enemy army a sharp, even annihilating, blow as rapidly as possible. It might involve stressed\n\na surprise assault against\n\nan unprotected flank, or both flanks.\n\nOn sev-\n\neral notable occasions, it\n\neven resulted in entire Prussian or\n\nGerman\n\narmies getting into the rear of an of any general schooled in the ally, a\n\nart.\n\nenemy army, the dream scenario The goal was Kesselschlacht: liter-\n\n\"cauldron battle,\" but more specifically a battle of encirclement,\n\none that hemmed in enemy forces on all sides before destroying them through a series of concentric operations. This vibrant and aggressive operational posture imposed certain requirements on German armies: an extremely high level of battlefield aggression and an officer corps that tended to launch attacks no matter what the odds, to give just two examples. The Germans also found over the years that conducting an operational-level war of movement required a flexible system of command that left a great deal of initiative in the hands of lower-ranking commanders. It is customary today to refer to this command system as Auftragstaktik (mission tactics): the higher commander devised a general mission (Auftrag), and then left the\n\nmeans of achieving it\n\nto the officer\n\non the\n\nspot. It\n\nis\n\nmore\n\naccurate,\n\nhowever, to speak, as the Germans themselves did, of the \"independence of the lower commander\" (Selbstandigkeit der Unterfiihrer). A s\n\nup a situation and act on his own was an equalizer for a numerically weaker army, allowing it to grasp opportunities that might be lost if it had to wait for reports and orders to climb up and down the chain of command. It wasn't always an elegant thing to behold. Prussian-German military history is filled with lower-level commanders making untimely commander's\n\nability to size\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nadvances, initiating highly unfavorable, even bizarre, attacks, and gen-\n\n—\n\nmaking nuisances of themselves at least from the perspective of the higher command. There were men like General Eduard von Flies, who launched one of the most senseless frontal assaults in military hiserally\n\ntory at the battle of Langensalza in 1866 against\n\na\n\ndug-in Hanoverian\n\n6\n\narmy that outnumbered him two to one General Karl von Steinmetz, whose impetuous command of the 1st Army in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 almost upset the entire operational applecart and General Hermann von Francois, whose refusal to follow orders almost de;\n\n7\n\n;\n\nrailed the East Prussian\n\ncampaign\n\nin 1914.\n\n8\n\nAlthough these events are\n\nnearly forgotten today, they represent the active, aggressive side of\n\nGerman\n\nopposed to the more thoughtful, intellectual approach of Karl Maria von Clausewitz, Alfred Graf von Schlieffen, or Helmuth von Molkte the Elder. Put differently, these hard chargers in the field tended to elevate the strength of the commander's will over a rational calculus of ends and means. Indeed, although Bewegungskrieg may have been a logical solution to Prussia's strategic problem, it was hardly a panacea. The classic illustration of its strengths and weaknesses was the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Frederick the Great opened the conflict with a classic the\n\ntradition, as\n\nfront-loaded campaign, assembling an\n\nimmense\n\nforce,\n\nseizing the\n\nby invading the Austrian province of Bohemia, and pounding the Austrian army in front of Prague with a series of highly aggressive attacks. Unfortunately, he also pounded his own army in strategic initiative\n\nthe process.\n\nWhen the\n\nFrederick attacked\n\nAustrians sent an army to the relief of Prague, 9\n\nit\n\ntoo, at Kolin. It\n\nmay\n\nhave been his\n\nown\n\nfault,\n\nor\n\nmay\n\nhave been due to an overambitious subordinate commander (a general named, of all things, von Manstein), but what Frederick init\n\ntended\n\nas\n\nan attack onto the Austrian right flank turned into\n\nassault against a well-prepared\n\nto 35,000.\n\nThe\n\na frontal\n\nenemy who outnumbered him 50,000\n\nPrussians were mauled and retreated in disarray.\n\nFrederick was\n\nnow in serious trouble. The Austrians were resurgent,\n\nthe Russians advancing,\n\nif\n\nponderously, from the\n\neast,\n\nand the French\n\nmoving on him from the west. He retrieved the situation by some of the most decisive victories of the entire era. First he crushed the French at Rossbach (November 1757), where another ambitious subordinate, the cavalry commander Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz (who, like Manstein, would also have a namesake general in World War II), played the crucial role, actually maneuvering his entire cavalry force 10 across the march route of the French army. Then, at Leuthen in December, Frederick's keen gift for operational maneuver resulted in\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe whole Prussian\n\narmy dramatically appearing on the perpendicular\n\nagainst a weakly defended Austrian left flank and a shocked Austrian\n\nhigh command. Finally, in August 1758, he warded off the Russians at Zorndorf, a murderous and close-fought battle that saw him march his\n\narmy\n\naround the Russian flank to attack it from the rear. Frederick had saved himself, for the moment, with classic examples of short, lively campaigns. But with his enemies refusing to make peace with him, the overall situation remained dire. The alliance facing him was huge and had many times his own number of men, cannon, and horse. His only way out now was to fight from the central position, holding secondary sectors with small forces (often commanded by his brother, Prince Henry ), rushing armies to whatever sector appeared most threatened in order to bring the enemy to battle there and crush him. Even while Prussia sat on the overall strategic defensive, however, the army's task was to remain a Well-honed instrument of attack. It had to be ready for pounding marches, aggressive assaults, and then more pounding marches. It couldn't destroy Frederick's adversaries, either singly or collectively. What it had to do instead was to land such a hard blow against any one of them France, let us say that Louis XV might well decide that seeking another round with Frederick wasn't worth the money, time, or effort, and therefore decide to drop out of the war. It wasn't an easy mission for the Prussian army, especially because the incessant attacks it launched in the first two years of the war had dulled its edge, with casualties among the officers and elite regiments being especially high. Prussia fought all its succeeding wars in similar fashion. It opened them by attempting to win rapid victories through the war of movement. Some, such as the October 1806 campaign against Napoleon, misfired horribly. Here the Prussian army deployed aggressively, far out on a limb to the west and south. It was an ideal spot to initiate offensive operations as Frederick the Great might have conceived them. Unfortunately, Frederick was long gone, his generals were in many cases well into their eighties, and they were now facing the Emperor of the French and his Grande Armee, two forces of nature in their respective primes. Prussia paid the price at the twin battles of Jena and entire\n\nclear\n\n11\n\n12\n\n—\n\nAuerstadt. It was Bewegungskrieg of a sort. Unfortunately,\n\n—\n\nall\n\nof the\n\nBewegung was performed by the French. Other Prussian campaigns succeeded beyond their commanders' wildest dreams. In 1866, General Helmuth von Moltke's dramatic victory at the battle of Koniggratz essentially won the war with Austria 13\n\nIntroduction\n\njust eight days after\n\nit\n\nbegan.\n\n14\n\nThe main\n\n7\n\naction in the war with France\n\nwas similarly brief. Prussian troops crossed the French border on August 4 and fought the climactic battle of St. Privat-Gravelotte two weeks later. Major operations in this war ended with an entire French army, and the emperor Napoleon III, bottled up in Sedan and smashed from all compass points simultaneously, perhaps the purest expression of the Kesselschlacht concept in history. The year 1914 was the major test for the Prussian (and now the German) doctrine of making war. The opening campaign was an immense operation involving the mobilization and deployment of no fewer than eight field armies; it was the brainchild of Count Alfred von Schlieffen, the chief of the General Staff until 1906. Like all German commanders, he had set a general operational framework (usually labeled, incorrectly, the Schlieffen Plan). What he most certainly did not do was to draw up any sort of detailed or prescriptive maneuver scheme. That, as always in the German way of war, was up to the commanders on the spot. The opening campaign in the west came within an inch of winning a decisive operational victory. The Germans smashed four of France's five field armies, nearly trapping the final one at Namur. They came far closer to winning the war than historians have generin 1870\n\n15\n\nally\n\nassumed, but eventually came to grief at the battle of the Marne in\n\nSeptember\n\n1914.\n\nThe failure at the Marne was the decisive moment of World War I. For German staff officers and commanders alike, it felt as if they had returned to the time of the Seven Years' War. All the ingredients were\n\nThere was the same sense of being surrounded by a coalition of powerful enemies. There was the same sense that the army would there.\n\nhad been before the bloodletting of that first autumn. Its new commander, General Erich von Falkenhayn, went so far as to tell Kaiser Wilhelm II that the army was a \"broken instrument\" incapable of winning any sort of annihilating victory. Most problematic was the locking of the western front into trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, and a solid wall of backing artillery. This was no longer mobile Bewegungskrieg, but its exact opposite, what the Germans call Stellungskrieg, the static war of position. With both armies hunkered down in trenches and hurling shells at one another, it was never be\n\nas\n\npowerful\n\nby definition\n\na\n\nas it\n\nwar of\n\nattrition,\n\nand that was\n\na conflict that\n\nGermany\n\ncould never win.\n\nGermany's only hope lay opponents out of the war.

For the most part, these offensive operations targeted the Russians, although there were huge offensives in the west in both 191 6 (against Verdun) and 191 sives of their\n\n(the so-called Kaiserschlacht, or \"Kaiser's battle,\" of the spring).\n\nwere\n\nalso large-scale offensives against the\n\nItalians at\n\nCaporetto in\n\nRomanians\n\n1917. It is significant that\n\nin 1916\n\nThere\n\nand the\n\nthe post-1918 profes-\n\nGerman army, the weekly Militar- Wbchenblatt, for example, spent almost as much time studying the Romanian campaign, a classic example of a rapid Bewegungskrieg, as it did the much sional literature of the\n\n16 campaigns of trench warfare in the west. Those four long years of trench warfare exhausted the German army and eventually ground it down, but they did not change the way the German officer corps viewed military operations. It should be clear by now that the Wehrmacht's situation after 1941, ringed by powerful enemies who vastly outnumbered it, was nothing particularly new in German military history. There were unique aspects of this war, such as Hitler's vast plans for European and world empire, his racialism and eagerness to commit genocide, and the willing participation of the Wehrmacht itself in the crimes of his regime. On the operational level, however, it was business as usual. The Wehrmacht, its staff, and its officer corps were all doing what the Prussian army had done under Frederick the Great and what the Kaiser's army had done under generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. Until the end of the war, it sought to land a resounding blow against one of its enemies a blow hard enough to shatter the enemy coalition, or at least to demonstrate the price that the Allies would have pay for victory. The strategy failed, but it certainly did its share of damage in those last four years, and it retained enough sting to the very end to give British, Soviet, and American commanders alike plenty of prema-\n\nlarger\n\n—\n\nture gray hairs.\n\nAlthough launching repeated offensives in order to smash the enemy coalition failed in the end, no one at the time or since has been able to come up with a better solution to Germany's strategic conundrum. A war-winning strategy? Not in this case, obviously. The optimal one for a Germany facing a world of enemies? Perhaps, perhaps not. An operational posture consistent with German military history and tradition as it had unfolded over the centuries? Absolutely.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nThe Work\n\nWehrmacht provided a characteristic answer to the question, \"What do you do when the blitzkrieg fails?\" by launching another one. The attempt to defeat the Soviet Union in a lightning campaign in 1941 had come to grief in front of Moscow, and the winter that followed was one of the worst periods in the history of the German army. In 1942, the\n\nIt survived,\n\nbut\n\nit\n\nsuffered massive casualties (over\n\n1\n\nmillion) and losses\n\nequipment and weapons that it had still not made good the following spring. Despite the low manpower and poor supply situation, the high command Adolf Hitler, the staffs of the army command and armed forces command, and the chief of the General Staff, General Franz Haider immediately began planning for another offensive round in the Soviet Union. They chose the southern sector, aiming for the oilfields of the Caucasus, a strategic target whose seizure would provide Germany with the fuel it needed to fight a war of almost indefinite duration and permanently cripple the Soviet war economy. Along the way, the army would have to block Soviet reinforcements from arriving in the sector by either masking or seizing the city of Stalingrad on the Volga River. Before this offensive, code-named Operation Blue, could begin, there also had to be certain preliminary operations: clearing Soviet forces out of the Crimea, for example, or cleaning up a number of jagged salients along the highly irregular front. For an army that had barely survived the previous winter, it was a full operational plate. So large were the demands that it would place on the Wehrmacht that the high command had no choice but to rely on the allied and satellite nations for much of its manpower: Italians, Hungarians, and especially Romanians. Although the mass of the Wehrmacht would be heading east this spring, a significant German force was already in contact with the British in North Africa. The \"western desert\" (as in \"west of Egypt\") was the highly unusual turf of General Erwin Rommel's Panzer armee. It, too, was a coalition force: a pair of German Panzer Divisions (grouped together into the Afrika Korps); the German 90th Light Division, a motorized formation especially equipped and trained for desert conditions; and a mass of Italian divisions, a few of them motorized (Ariete armored division, for example), but most straight leg infantry. As May dawned, Rommel's army was facing a much larger and better-equipped British 8th Army, ensconced in a toiigh defenin\n\n—\n\n—\n\n17\n\nsive position that stretched\n\nout into the desert south of Gazala.\n\nThe\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nmany ways unique, but Wehrmacht was marching off\n\noperational problems of desert warfare were in\n\nsome things never change. Just to attack a\n\nmuch larger and Rommel react to\n\nas the\n\nwealthier adversary in Operation Blue,\n\nentrenched enemy that outnumbered him, by doing the characteristic thing: launching an offensive at Gazala, Operation Theseus, that would mark the apogee of so, too,\n\ndid\n\nhis situation, an\n\nhis career.\n\nDeath of the Wehrmacht is intended as a sequel to my previous book, The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich.

Starting\n\nbloody, assault on what was at the time the strongest fortress in the\n\nworld: Sevastopol.\n\nFrom\n\nhere,\n\nwe move\n\nnorth.

The Red Army launched an offensive of its own, this one out of the Izyum salient toward Kharkov. It was a new model Soviet force, one that relied on tanks and more tanks, very different from the infantry horde that the Germans had come to expect from 1941. The clash of armor would be one of the largest in the war so far, and the result would be one of the greatest victories of annihilation in the history of the\n\nGerman army.\n\nKerch and Kharkov, Rommel own grand offensive at Gazala. The situation seemed\n\nJust weeks after decisive victories at\n\nwould launch\n\nhis\n\nIntroduction\n\nparticularly unpropitious for an offensive.\n\nManpower\n\nlevels,\n\n11\n\nnumbers\n\n—\n\nof tanks and guns, the inherent strength of the defense all these crucial factors tilted decisively toward the British. The Panzerarmee had\n\nsomething\n\ntoo: not only a skilled general, but a\n\nfor seeking the operational-level opening,\n\nway of war\n\nthat called\n\none that scoffed\n\nat\n\nan \"or-\n\ndinary victory\" in favor of an annihilating one. Rommel's solution to the Gazala problem was simple:\n\nmarch\n\nmechanized army, in the dead of night and across a featureless desert, around the flank of his adversary. The British woke up to more than their morning tea: they found an entire tank army in the rear of their carefully constructed defensive line. When all was said and done, the 8th Army had been routed, Rommel had seized the fortress, Tobruk, that had eluded him the previous year, and the Panzerarmee was in Egypt, driving hard for Alexandria, the Nile River, and the Suez Canal. It was an amazing May, but everyone in the Wehrmacht planning circles knew that the main event was yet to come. Operation Blue began well and ended badly, a microcosm of German operations in both world wars. With no fewer than five German armies (along with three, and later four, from the satellite countries) involved in the initial thrusts, it was a complex plan over which Hitler and Haider alike were determined to maintain a firm grip. Above all, they wanted to avoid the operational chaos that had arisen during the drive on Moscow the previous fall, a factor that had played no small role in the German his entire\n\nfailure.\n\nThe\n\nsuccess of the opening assault seemed to bear\n\nthem\n\nout. Blue\n\nslashed through the Soviet lines within days, heading east toward Vo-\n\nronezh and then swinging to the south, brushing the Don River with its sleeve on the left. The Red Army appeared to have been caught off balance. Most of its best formations were completely out of position, screening Moscow from the southwest against a thrust that never came. In front of the German assault, one Soviet formation after another simply vanished. Seen by some\n\nas a\n\nnew,\n\nflexible operational ap-\n\nproach on the part of the Soviet army and by others as simple flight, it was probably something in the middle: an order to retreat from higher command echelons that got lost in translation by the time it had reached the common riflemen in the field. At any rate, it was a process attended by a sense of chaos\n\nall its\n\nFrom the German perspective,\n\nown.\n\nthe Soviet\n\nflight,\n\nwhether planned or\n\nspontaneous, was a development that threatened the entire operational sequence of Operation Blue.

It is a disturbing picture: a sequence of fired generals and a raving Fiihrer, hastily improvised operational plans, and in the background, a million-man army hurtling ever further from its bases of supply and communications. By September, it was stuck, with two strong arrowheads embedded firmly at Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, unable to reach its objectives and equally unable, or unwilling, to retreat. It was in southern Russia that Bewegungskrieg ground to a halt, giving way to the very type of war that the German army had historically tried to avoid: Stellungskrieg. At virtually the same time, the wheels at come off of Rommel's offensive as well, and he too found himself stuck fast against superior forces. The result in both theaters would be decisive and catastrophic defeat. After their promising starts, the German offensives of 1942 would give birth to twins: Stalingrad and El Alamein. In the course of this survey, we will attempt to answer some fundamental questions about the Wehrmacht. How does a military force configured, armed, and trained for the offensive war of movement and quick victory cope with a military situation that suddenly turns sour? will\n\na\n\nHow much much ers?\n\nresponsibility does Hitler bear for the catastrophe?\n\nshould be shared by the General Staff and the\n\nHow\n\ncommandand how much\n\nfield\n\nHow much was it the result of individual decisions,\n\nwas the result of more impersonal, systemic factors, the complicated matrix of military culture, tradition, and history that comprise the German way of war? Indeed, how much of it was simply chance? Throughout, I have tried to refrain from argumentation that attempts to show \"how the German army could have won at Stalingrad\" or \"what the Wehrmacht should have done to win the war.\" This is a history book. It does not offer a series of perfect plans for 1942 as if it could make any difference at this point; nor does it purport to be a manual of lessons learned. These approaches, which praise this decision as \"correct\" and that one as \"wrong\" with all the assurance of a sixteenth-century reformer parsing Scripture, are essentially ahistorical (as important as they may be to the training of soldiers and officers). They are akin to writing a history of the French Revolution that does nothing but tell Louis XVI how he could have avoided it. Operational history (that is, explaining what actually happened in the course of a campaign, and why) is complicated enough without spend-\n\n—\n\n19\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ning time lecturing the historical actors on what they ought to have\n\ndone.\n\n20\n\nAdmittedly, there are times to split the offensive into\n\ntwo\n\nwhen\n\nit is\n\nhard not\n\nto. Hitler's\n\ndecision\n\nparts in late July 1942 and head simul-\n\ntaneously for Stalingrad and the Caucasus (Directive 45) is a classic example. Another was the decision, shared by all levels of authority, to\n\nRommel\n\nEgypt with an unconquered Malta\n\nchoking off his supply lines. In both cases, however, the Germans came within an ace of victory anyway. The short distances, in some cases only hunsend\n\ninto\n\nWehrmacht from its strategic objecCaucasus, and North Africa should give anyone\n\ndreds of yards, that separated the tives in Stalingrad, the\n\nstill\n\npause about treating 1942 as\n\na\n\nforegone Conclusion.\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat 2941\n\nIn the opening years of World\n\nWar\n\nII,\n\nthe\n\nGerman army uncorked\n\na\n\nrun of victories that was quite unlike anything in living memory. In contrast to World War I, in which the front lines soon solidified and battlefield stalemate was the norm, this war saw the Germans move from one dramatic success to another. With their fearsome tank, or Panzer, formations as an apparently irresistible spearhead, and with a powerful\n\nair\n\nforce (Luftwaffe) circling overhead, the\n\nWehrmacht ran\n\nthrough, around, and over every defensive position thrown in\n\nits\n\npath.\n\nThe opening campaign in Poland (which went by the operational name Case White) saw the Germans smash the Polish army in eighteen days, although a bit more fighting was necessary to reduce the capital, Warsaw. Equally impressive was the invasion of Denmark and Norway (which went by the operational name Exercise Weser), which saw two enemy capitals, Oslo and Copenhagen, fall on the first day to a combination of ground forces, seaborne landings, and paratroopers. Still, there were those among the European general staffs who took comfort in the fact that up to now, the Wehrmacht was beating up on 1\n\n2\n\nweaker, smaller neighbors.\n\nThe\n\ngreat offensive in the\n\nWest\n\nin\n\nMay\n\n1940 (Case Yellow) quickly disabused them of that notion. Here, the German Panzer formations met and smashed the cream of the French and British armies, destroying the former and booting the latter off the continent altogether in a hurried evacuation from one of the last ports still in British hands, Dunkirk. Even with most of the British army gone, the Germans took something like 2 million French, British, Dutch, and Belgian prisoners. Combined with the minimal nature of their own losses, Case Yellow was one of the most decisive military victories in history.\n\n3\n\nThe next year continued the\n\npattern.\n\nA lightning drive into the Bal-\n\nkans in April 1941 overran both Yugoslavia and Greece. 14\n\nWhen\n\na Brit-\n\n5\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\nish\n\narmy\n\narrived to help defend the latter, the\n\nGermans drove\n\nit\n\n1\n\nfrom\n\nposition to position, then off the mainland altogether, forcing their\n\nsecond forced evacuation in less than a year. The British destination this time was Crete, where they were hit by a true thunderbolt: Operation Mercury, the first all-airborne military operahapless foe into\n\nits\n\n4 tion in history. It quickly seized the island\n\nmonwealth defenders, who had\n\nfrom\n\nits\n\nBritish and\n\nCom-\n\nto evacuate again, this time to Egypt.\n\nIndeed, in the opening period of the war,\n\nit\n\nsometimes seemed\n\nlike the\n\nevacuation had become the characteristic British military operation. Certainly no other army in the world had as\n\nmuch\n\npractice at\n\nit.\n\nGerman operations in World War II continues somehow novel, as an example of a new method of\n\nAnalysis of these\n\nthem as warmaking called to paint\n\nblitzkrieg,\n\nor \"lightning war.\" Allegedly invented\n\ntransformed warfare by mechanizing it. In place of the foot soldier and the cavalry, there were now machines, especially tanks and aircraft. In place of the trench deadlock that had characterized World War I were vast campaigns of breakthrough, encirclement, and maneuver. In fact, the word itself is in the interwar era, blitzkrieg\n\nis\n\nsaid to have\n\n5\n\nmisnomer. The German army didn't invent it, and they hardly ever used the word outside of quotation marks. It was a term that seems to have been kicked around international military circles in the 1930s to describe any rapid and decisive victory, in contrast to the long, horrible war of attrition that had just ended. Even if they didn't invent the blitzkrieg, however, the Germans clearly did something in the interwar period. It had been a time of rethinking and experimentation for them, certainly, but we might say the same thing for all armies of the day. The British had invented the tank and were working on a radical Experimental Mechanized Brigade as early as 1928. Likewise, if there was one military force in the world that seemed obsessed with the possibilities of tanks, aircraft, and paratroopers, it would had to have been the Red Army. What distinguished the activity of the interwar German army (the Reichswehr until 1934, then renamed the Wehrmacht) was that it was not trying to discover anything new. It felt that it already had a workable wara\n\n6\n\nwar of movement on the operational level. This is where the Germans saw tanks and aircraft as making their contribution. These new weapons had to be used on the operational level that is, in large units, from divisions on up. The result was the Panzer Division, a unit built around tanks but containing a full panoply of combined arms: infantry, artillery, reconnaissance, supply columns, bridging trains, and more, all of which had their mobility fighting doctrine: Bewegungskrieg, the 7\n\n—\n\nChapter One\n\n16\n\nraised to the level of the tank.\n\nA Panzer\n\nDivision was more than any\n\ncontemporary army could handle from 1939 to 1941. It could assault and penetrate, smash through into the clear, pursue, and destroy any defensive position or formation that tried to stop it, then reform and do it all over again. It wasn't a wonder weapon or magic bullet, but it certainly might have looked that way to a Polish lancer or a Belgian antitank gunner.\n\nAs important\n\n8\n\nas the\n\ntank and the airplane was the Wehrmacht's highly\n\ncommand and control. Some of this hearkened German traditions, especially the notion of the inde-\n\narticulated system of\n\nback to older pendence of the lower commander, often referred to, incorrectly, as 9 Auftragstaktik, or mission tactics. Arising first out of the distinctive in which the king had only limited ausocial contract in old Prussia thority to intervene in the operations of his commanders, who were without exception of the noble, or Junker, caste it had evolved over\n\n—\n\n—\n\nthe centuries into the distinctive characteristic of\n\nPrussian and\n\nvon\n\nGerman\n\ncommand\n\nin the\n\nHelmuth modern field\n\narmies.

There were simply too many factors in play: huge forces,\n\noperations had\n\ncomplex weaponry, and massive supply requirements, not to mention the friction and fog that were simply part of war in any era. Under Moltke, the Prussian army prided itself on providing general missions to lower levels of command, then allowing the lower commander to devise the best\n\nway\n\nto carry\n\nthem\n\nout.\n\nOn\n\nall\n\nlevels\n\nof command, or-\n\nders were to be short, snappy, and to the point.

The recipient was to listen, repeat the order out loud in the presence of his superior, and then go off and carry it out in the best possible way. On its face, the Prussian command system might seem to be a recipe for chaos, a free-for-all in which each division, corps, and army commander fought his own private war. In fact, there were two circumstances that worked in its favor. The staff system was the first. While on campaign, each commander had a chief of the General Staff at his side, an operational advisor and confidante. He was not a co-commander, and in fact the formation commander always bore ultimate responsibility for his own decisions and the performance of his unit. The chief of staff, however, was an elite officer who had been taught ers\n\nat all possible,\n\n7\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n1\n\nthe art of war in a highly selective school with a murderously difficult\n\nMembers of the staff tended to way and to dispense remarkably\n\ncurriculum, the famous Kriegsakademie. see operational problems in a similar\n\ncommanders with whom they worked.

It rarely meant slacking or lying down on the job. Prussia-Germany had fought dozens of campaigns since the seventeenth century, and virtually all of them saw the army on the operational offensive, seeking to strike a sharp and unsettling blow against its opponents. The \"short and lively war\" demanded most always consisted of one\n\nthing:\n\nsuch an aggressive posture. Frederick the Great was the exemplar, perhaps the most aggressive commander of the entire eighteenth century, and certainly\n\nwas\n\nall\n\none of the top ten of\n\nthat complicated.\n\nall\n\ntime.\n\nHe\n\n\"The Prussian army always\n\ndidn't think\n\nwar\n\nhe once path through the Napoleonic wars, attacks,\"\n\nDuring Prussia's difficult there was Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher, a septuagenarian oddball who wedded an innate battlefield drive and aggression to a visceral hatred of the French enemy. His art of war wasn't all that intellectual, either; his men nicknamed him Marschall Voi~warts (Gen10 eral Forward). During the wars of unification, Moltke may have been said.\n\nthe brains of the army,\n\nits\n\nwere army commanders\n\ndoctrinal and administrative wizard.

This spirit of aggression was not something that the German army invented one afternoon in 1935. The preference for the \"short and lively\" war; Bewegungskrieg (the war of movement on the operational level); an officer corps that was allowed to handle matters in the field as it saw fit, without a great deal of interference from above, and that paid for that privilege in blood, some of its own and a great deal belonging to the men under its command; tanks and aircraft working in close harmony, commanded and controlled by the modern miracle of radio communications these comprised the impressive and highly successful operational package the Germans brought to the table in the opening years of World War II. Like all military cultures, it was a unique combination of traits, a\n\n—\n\n18\n\nChapter One\n\n\"distinctive language\"\n\nspoken only by the Wehrmacht,\n\nGerman military journal of the in\n\nall\n\nday, the Militdr Wochenblatt, put\n\nof Germany's wars, the main\n\nin Full Stride:\n\n12\n\nit.\n\nAs\n\n—indeed, the only—question was\n\nwhether Germany's adversaries could learn to decipher\n\nBewegungskrieg\n\nas the leading\n\nit\n\nin time.\n\nThe Balkans, 1941\n\nwar was a simple contest to see who could most completely humiliate an opponent in a first encounter, then the Wehrmacht would have won World War II, hands down. The Polish, Danish, Norwegian, French, Yugoslavian, Greek, British, and Soviet armies all learned this lesson the hard way. The first six armies did not survive to tell the tale, nor did the states they were called on to defend. British armies were smashed not just in their first encounter with the Wehrmacht (in If\n\nFrance), but also in the next three, as well (in\n\nNorth Africa,\n\nin Greece,\n\nand then again in Crete). Britain managed to survive the experience thanks to the presence of the English Channel, a sturdy water barrier that has stopped many would-be invaders since 1066. Finally, the Soviet army was hammered as hard as any military force in history during that first awful campaigning season, from June to December 1941. It was an utterly hapless performance that saw it sustain the incredible total of 4 million casualties in six short months, most of them prisoners lost in one massive Kesselschlacht after another. And finally, lest we forget, the U.S. Army's first meeting with the Wehrmacht, on an obscure hunk of Tunisian rock known as the Kasserine Pass, was a humbling experience that should have made all Americans happy for the existence of the Atlantic Ocean. The point is that first encounters with the Wehrmacht were inherently dangerous. This was an army that liked its campaigns frontloaded, meticulously planned, and designed for maximum impact. The corollary was that those who survived that first encounter had taken the best shot that the Germans had to offer. For the Wehrmacht, things were always going to go downhill after it delivered that first devastating blow. The advantage in sustainability was always going to lie with the Allies, especially after the entry of the United States into the war in 1941. As satisfying as it would be to blame the problem on individuals within the Nazi leadership, it was not due to poor planning on Hitler's part or to the General Staffs deep and documented disinterest in logistics. It was simply the way things were, the way they had been since the 1600s, and the way they would still be to-\n\nFrom Victory\n\n19\n\nGermany had survived World War II as a great military power. there was still a German General Staff, there would still be war-\n\nday, If\n\nto Defeat: 1941\n\nif\n\nfighting doctrine based\n\non landing\n\na\n\nknockout punch early through\n\naggressive, mobile operations.\n\nOne of the classic examples of Bewegungskrieg in World War II was the German campaign in the Balkans in the spring of 1941. Here the 13\n\nGermans fought\n\nthe front-loaded campaign to perfection, with the\n\nGerman 2nd and\n\n12th\n\nArmies launching two simultaneous operations into Greece and Yugoslavia on April 6. Operation Marita the invasion of Greece had been in the works for months, a response to the humiliating defeat suffered by the Italian army in its invasion of Greece in late 1940. Not only had the hardy Greeks stopped Italian forces at the border, but they also had gone on the offensive, driving into Albania and threatening to unhinge the entire Axis position in the Balkans. The invasion of Yugoslavia, by contrast, had been put together overnight, quite literally, as a response to a pro-Allied coup in Belgrade on the night of March 26-27, 1941. It was an improvisation,\n\n—\n\n—\n\njust the sort of thing that the\n\nGermans\n\nhistorically excelled\n\nat.\n\nThe\n\nbrief time span for conception and planning did leave a few loose ends\n\nhere and there, and in nearly It is\n\nAfter\n\nfact,\n\nthe undertaking would take place under the\n\nanonymous designation of Operation\n\n25.\n\neasy to underestimate the significance of a campaign like all,\n\ngiven\n\nits\n\npopulation and resource advantages,\n\nthis.\n\nGermany\n\nshould have been able to beat the Greek army, or the Yugoslav army, or both at the same time, without breaking a sweat.\n\nWe might say the\n\nsame thing about the Polish campaign in 1939, or the invasion of Denmark and Norway in 1940. Yet those who look at the Balkan campaign and see only a great power landing a hit on two of the war's weaker sisters miss the point entirely: the Wehrmacht's complete and rapid victory over the Greeks and Yugoslavs precisely mirrors the treatment it meted out in every first encounter of the war, without exception.\n\nOperation 25: Yugoslavia\n\nFor centuries, the ideal of Prussian-German military operations had been the concentric attack, with converging columns coming at the defender from\n\nall\n\ndirections and\n\nmaking\n\nit\n\nimpossible for\n\nhim\n\nto\n\nany sort of coherent position. In that sense, Operation 25 marks a culmination point in the German art of war. With Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria all safely in the Axis camp by this time, the establish\n\nChapter One\n\n20\n\nattacking force of\n\nGerman and German- allied (Hungarian and\n\nItal-\n\nbe strung out over an immense crescent nearly 400 miles long, from Trieste on the Adriatic in the north to the BulgarianYugoslav border in the south. Moving from right to left, there was Italian 2nd Army, German 2nd Army under General Maximilian von Weichs (consisting of XXXXIX Mountain Corps, LI and LII Corps, ian) armies could\n\nXXXXVI Panzer Corps); Hungarian 3rd Army; an independent German XXXXI Panzer Corps; and, finally, 1st Panzer Group (Field and\n\nMarshal Ewald von Kleist). With the Italians and Hungarians having to be cajoled into doing anything more than occupying a place in the line, the heavy lifting was the task of the three German formations. Weichs's army was deployed in the Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Styria, curling around the Slovenian-Croatian bend in northern Yugoslavia; XXXXI Panzer Corps was deployed in western Romania, near Timosoara; Kleist 's Panzer group lay far to the south, in western Bulgaria.\n\nThe\n\nSchwerpunkt, or point of main effort, included no fewer than\n\non the capital, Belgrade. On the right, XXXXVI Panzer Corps (2nd Army) would deploy in Nagykanizsa in Hungary, southwest of Lake Balaton. It would cross the Drava River into Yugoslavia, then wheel sharply southeast toward Belgrade. In the center, the independent XXXXI Panzer Corps under General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, including the 2nd S.S. Motorized Division, the Grossdeutschland Motorized Infantry Regiment, and the Hermann Goring Panzer Regiment, had the shortest hop to Belgrade, a straight shot heading almost due south. Finally, on the extreme left, 1st Panzer Group would send two corps (XIV Panzer and XI) across three mighty mechanized columns driving\n\nthe Bulgarian border, head toward Nis, and then wheel sharply to the north.\n\nAs always\n\nin\n\nGerman\n\noperations, the point of these multiple\n\ndrives was not simply to seize the capital, but rather to threaten a strategic object that the Yugoslavs could not afford to lose\n\ntherefore have to defend.\n\nAs\n\nin the Franco-Prussian\n\nwar\n\ning in the general direction of the capital was the best\n\nconfrontation with the enemy's main\n\nThe\n\nYugoslavs did what\n\nall\n\nfield\n\narmy.\n\nand would\n\nin 1870, driv-\n\nway\n\nto ensure a\n\n14\n\nof Germany's enemies had done in the\n\ntwo years of the war. They tried to defend every inch of the country's borders, establishing what the Germans called a \"cordon position\" (Kordonstellung). The 1st Army Group stood in the north, consisting of\n\nfirst\n\nArmy in Slovenia, facing the German and Italian frontiers, and the 4th Army along the Hungarian border. The 2nd Army Group stood to its right, with 2nd Army along the Danube and 1st Army in the 7th\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n21\n\nAn\n\nindependent 6th Army deployed to the east, along the Romanian border, defending the district known as the Banat as well as the northern approaches to Belgrade. Finally, a 3rd Army Group (5th and 3rd Armies) had to cover an immense stretch of western part of the Vojvodina.\n\nsouthern Yugoslavia, with 5th Army along the Bulgarian border and 3rd Army standing watch against the Italians on the Albanian frontier. None of these \"armies\" was up to modern standards. They consisted, typically, of\n\ntwo\n\nto four\n\nweak infantry\n\ndivisions,\n\nalry division or brigade. Reserve forces\n\nthey are by definition in\n\na\n\nwith an attached cav-\n\nwere grossly inadequate,\n\ncordon defense. The 3rd\n\nArmy Group\n\nas\n\nin the\n\nsouth, for example, had a single infantry division in reserve at Skoplje,\n\nand the entire Yugoslav reserve consisted of three infantry divisions and one cavalry division. Although each army had some terrain feature in front of it (typically one of Yugoslavia's numerous rivers: the Drava, Sava, Morava, and Danube), the deployment offered no hope of operational maneuver. Strategic redeployment to respond to threats as they developed, always tricky in a linear defense, would simply be impossible in this case. Neither the road nor rail net would permit it. It is interesting to note that this was still the orthodox response 15\n\nWehrmacht's mobile operations. The Poles had done the same September 1939, stringing their armies in a cordon over 875 miles\n\nto the in\n\nlong along the border with Greater\n\nGermany and\n\nSlovakia.\n\nThe\n\n16\n\nFrench and British had also attempted a linear defense of western Europe in 1940, which was penetrated in three days. The Yugoslav army was not an insignificant force: it included seventeen active and twelve reserve infantry divisions, plus three cavalry divisions and a number of nondivisional brigades.\n\nWhen\n\nfully mobilized,\n\nnumbered nearly\n\nit\n\n10,000,000 men. Still, lining it up to defend 1,900 miles of border was to extend it far beyond its capabilities. To be fair, the Yugoslav supreme commander, General Dusan Simovic (who had also been one of the ringleaders of the coup that precipitated the\n\nGerman invasion), was\n\nfaced with a\n\nnumber of equally\n\nbad alternatives. Analysts of the campaign both then and since have spoken of the advantages of a pullback from the borders and a concentrated defense of\n\nsome\n\ncentral position, perhaps Belgrade\n\nitself, just\n\nof the Polish campaign tend to talk up a withdrawal to the river lines of the Narew, Vistula, and San.

But military historians need\n\nChapter One\n\n22\n\nany strategy that advocates the immediate abandonment of over 90% of the national territory before a shot has even been fired is a nonstarter. It is a school exercise, in other words, utterly divorced to admit that\n\nfrom the reality of politics. No government in the modern era will ever do it, or could afford to. Moreover, the situation within Yugoslavia was not all propitious for the success of any strategy. The state was riven by ethnic tension. Neither the Slovenes nor the Croats could generate much enthusiasm about fighting for a Serb-dominated regime 17\n\nwhich, in their opinion, treated them the urging of\n\nGerman propaganda\n\nbroadcasts and\n\nleaflets,\n\nbers of Croats would desert once the shooting started.\n\nOperation 25 played out\n\nUnder large num-\n\nlike second-class citizens.\n\nfairly predictably,\n\n18\n\ngiven the balance of\n\nweaponry in play, and the imperatives of German doctrine. No campaign in Prussian or German history had a more pressing need It had been designed overnight, the to be wrapped up so quickly. formations fighting it had to be dragged hither and yon from across forces, the\n\n19\n\nGermany and\n\nthe occupied territories into this remote and underde-\n\nveloped theater, and the Panzer units, at least, had to finish their business and then be ready for transfer to the east. Barbarossa was only\n\nmonths away. An army that habitually moved fast was about to kick the tempo up one more notch. The campaign opened with a massive early-morning bombing raid against a nearly undefended Belgrade. It was April 6, the Orthodox Eas-\n\ntwo and\n\na half\n\nOperation Punishment, the Wehrmacht did something that many later military ventures have tried, yet none have been able to achieve: a \"decapitation\" of the enemy's command structure. The Luftwaffe came in three separate waves, some 500 sorties in all, flying mainly from bases in the Ostmark and western Romania. Not only did the Germans destroy the obsolete Yugoslav air force and Belgrade's weak antiaircraft screen, pound large chunks of the city into rubble, and kill thousands of civilians, they also destroyed the communication links between the Yugoslav high command and the field formations. It was an unprecedented event, an air power advocate's dream, that left virtually every operational unit in the army begging for direction and orders just at the moment that the Wehrmacht poured over the borter Sunday. In\n\nders in strength.\n\nThe\n\nLuftwaffe's losses amounted to just two aircraft.\n\nno exaggeration to say that Operation Punishment had won the Yugoslav campaign in the first twenty minutes. The raid, and especially the massive number of civilian deaths, would also be one of the war crimes included in the later indictment against General Alexander It is\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n23\n\nLohr, commander of Luftflotte 4; he would be executed in Belgrade in i947-\n\nM\n\nThe\n\nnow began, as 1st Panzer Group crossed the borsouth on April 8.

As planned, the Panzers now wheeled north, driving rapidly along the valley of the Morava River toward Belgrade. Resistance was weak and getting weaker, and the high command soon decided 21 to remove 5th Panzer Division from the main drive on the capital. It peeled off in a southwesterly direction, making it one of the few formations to take part in both Operation 25 against Yugoslavia and Operation Marita against Greece. By April 12, 1st Panzer Group stood just 35 miles south of Belgrade; it was also deep in the rear of Yugoslav 6th Army, still deployed along the Romanian border. The second element in the drive on Belgrade was XXXXVI Panzer Corps, part of 2nd Army. The original schedule called for 2nd Army's attack to begin on April 12, which had then been moved up to April\n\nCorps\n\n10.\n\ntrailing, Kleist's forces\n\nSome\n\nanalysts\n\nstill\n\nsee this as a deliberate staggering of the initial\n\nthrusts to further confuse the\n\nthe main blow.\n\n22\n\nA better\n\nenemy\n\nleadership as to the location of\n\nexplanation was the difficulty the\n\nGermans\n\nwere having in transporting the assault formations into position. The Yugoslav border was immense, and the entire region was vastly underserved by road and rail. The 2nd Army, in particular, was still arriving in the theater when the bombers appeared over Belgrade. Nonetheless, there were a series of small attacks by German units as they deployed, often undertaken on the initiative of the local commander. These included the seizure of a road bridge at Bares and a rail bridge near Koprivnica.\n\n23\n\nEven before the\n\nstart of\n\nformal\n\nhostilities, the sluggish\n\nYugoslav response to these provocations, due no doubt to the large proportion of Croats in the Yugoslav 7th Army, the principal defender in this sector,\n\nshowed the Germans that there was trouble\n\nin the en-\n\nemy camp.\n\nWhen XXXXVI\n\nPanzer Corps's actual attack opened on April 10, it blew a hole in the Yugoslav line almost immediately. Although most of the corps wheeled southeast to join in the drive on Belgrade, one division, the 14th Panzer, headed for the Croatian capital, Zagreb (\"Agram\" to the Germans). The drive on Zagreb was an epic in its own way. Rolling at top speed, moving so rapidly that it was out of radio communications with corps and\n\narmy headquarters\n\nfor\n\nmuch\n\nof\n\nChapter One\n\n24\n\nGREATER\n\nGERMANY\n\nADRIATIC SEA\n\nMap\n\ni.\n\nOperation\n\n25:\n\nconcentric operations in Yugoslavia.\n\nsmashed through position after position, taking 15,000 prisoners, among them twenty-two Yugoslav generals. It reached Zagreb by nightfall after traveling almost one hundred miles since morning. It ended the day being feted by thousands of enthusiastic Croats who considered the arrival of the Germans as a day of liberation from Serb the day,\n\nit\n\noppression. 24\n\non Belgrade was that of the XXXXI Panzer Corps. After crossing the Romanian- Yugoslav border south of Timosoara on April 11, Reinhardt's corps almost immediately broke\n\nThe\n\nthird motorized drive\n\nthrough Yugoslav 6th\n\nArmy\n\nand raced into the\n\nclear.\n\nThe\n\nrelatively\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n25\n\nweak force, consisting of little more than the Grossdeutschland Regiment and 2nd S.S. Motorized Infantry Division, drove halfway to Belgrade in a single day, reaching Pancevo by nightfall and preparing itself for a drive on the capital the next day. Already, the Yugoslav situation had deteriorated to the point that General Simovic sent orders to his three army groups to \"fight the enemy wherever you may be in contact with him in all directions, on your own initiative, without awaiting 25 special orders from higher command echelons.\" Even today, it is difficult to say which German force arrived first in Belgrade. With all three sending mobile detachments ahead of the main body in a headlong rush, even the German high command wasn't exactly sure. Elements of the 2nd S.S. Motorized Infantry Division (XXXXI Panzer Corps) crossed into the city on rafts over the Danube in the early evening of April 12; patrols of 8th Panzer Division (2nd Army) entered at about the same time from the north; and nth Panzer Division (1st Panzer Group) did the same from the south. Although none of these armored drives met with much opposition, they did have to negotiate some of Europe's most difficult terrain, and the exercise showed that there really isn't any such thing as \"bad tank country\" to a well-trained and aggressive armored force. Although sending flying armored columns into enemy territory might have been risky in a different context, here the principal problem was dealing with the hordes of Yugoslav soldiers wishing to surrender. With the capital in German hands and the Yugoslav front broken everywhere, and with Italian and Hungarian troops finally crossing the Yugoslav border, all that remained was the final pursuit. There was some fear on the part of the German command that remnants of the defeated army would retreat into the mountain fastness of the southern part of the country, in particular Bosnia.\n\nTo counter the threat,\n\nthe\n\nGermans now redirected virtually all their mobile formations toward a drive on Sarajevo. One pursuit group, spearheaded by 14th Panzer Division, moved in from the west; another, with 8th Panzer Division approached the city from the east. The city fell to these converging drives on April 15, the tenth day of hostilities, signaling the end of major operations. 26 An armistice would be signed on April 17. The Wehrmacht had overrun Yugoslavia in record time and with\n\nin the van,\n\nmillion-man army and taken at least 250,000 prisoners in this short campaign. Its own casualties were just 151 dead, 392 wounded, and 15 missing. The ingredients for the rout were obviease. It\n\nous.\n\nhad dismantled\n\nOn\n\nGerman side, they included superior training and weapcommand of the air; and a high degree of mechanization,\n\nthe\n\nonry; total\n\na\n\n26\n\nChapter One\n\nat least at\n\nthe cutting edge. For the Yugoslavs, there was the lateness\n\nof the mobilization decree, which resulted in numerous units being overrun before they were fully prepared for combat; lack of air and armor; the decision to defend every inch of the country's long border; and, perhaps\n\nmost importantly, the ethnic troubles\n\nespecially in the Croatian territories.\n\ninside the country,\n\nOne German\n\nstaff officer called\n\n27 Operation 25 more of \"a military parade\" than a campaign, and that is 28 in many ways a fair assessment of this \"twelve-day war.\" Still, there is more to it than that. The conquest of Yugoslavia was a distilled form of the German way of war as it had developed over the centuries. As one German source put it, after the breakthrough along the border fortifications, the Yugoslav army was \"smashed in the open field, held in place by German infantry forced-marching in the pursuit, overtaken and encircled by the mobile troops, broken down by uninterrupted attack from the air while on the march and during rail 29 transport.\" It was a \"lightning victory\" (Blitzsieg), one that displayed every aspect of the German operational package. The assembly of massive force; a plan that included a violent blow from the very outset\n\nin the\n\nform of the vicious\n\nfor the land forces that\n\nair raids\n\non Belgrade;\n\nemphasized shock,\n\na\n\nmaneuver scheme\n\nrapidity,\n\nand\n\na\n\nconcentric\n\nadvance against a crucial objective in the enemy's heartland\n\n—these\n\nhad been the ingredients of Bewegungskrieg at least since the days of Moltke. Given the gross imbalance of force, the Wehrmacht should have beaten the Yugoslav army and swiftly overrun the country; that much is obvious. But as Prussian and German armies had shown other armies in other times and places, when the war of movement was working as it should, it could make many a campaign appear to be a \"military parade.\"\n\nThere\n\nis\n\none\n\nlast\n\naspect of the quick and almost painless victory\n\nin Yugoslavia that deserves mention, especially as\n\nGerman way\n\nit\n\nreflects\n\non the\n\nof war. Despite the totality of the victory, this was a\n\ncampaign with an extremely problematic aftermath. By the end of the operation, fighting had already broken out within Yugoslavia between Serbs and Croats in Mostar and other parts of Dalmatia. With German forces being redeployed rapidly to the East and the land occupied by relatively small forces, there was no one to stop it, even if the Germans had wanted to. Moreover, a quick look at the math of the campaign (250,000 prisoners taken out of an army that numbered almost 1 million when fully mobilized) would indicate that large forces had indeed escaped the German net. The Germans had advanced so far and so fast that they left numerous loose ends. Yugoslav soldiers\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n27\n\ncut off from their units soon took to the mountains to form resistance\n\nGermans would\n\nbands, and the\n\nfind themselves conducting an anti-\n\npartisan campaign for the rest of the war.\n\namong\n\n30\n\nThere was no unanimity\n\nthese groups about the kind of Yugoslavia they wished to recre-\n\nonce they had liberated the country, and they would spend as much time fighting each other as fighting the Germans. Royalist Chetniks under Colonel Draza Mihailovic and the communist Partisans under Josip Broz, code-named Tito, would fight their own bloody war for the future of Yugoslavia, a tale outside our purview here. Nevertheless, there is something incomplete about a way of war that relies on the shock value of small, highly mobile forces and airpower, that stresses rapidity of victory over all, and that then has a difficult time putting the country it has conquered back together again. ate\n\nOperation Marita: Greece\n\nwas more of the same in Greece. Here the Wehrmacht encountered not just another weak army of a second-rate power, but British and Commonwealth forces as well. Operation Marita met Operation LusIt\n\ntre,\n\nfrom North Africa\n\nthe transfer of a British expeditionary force\n\nto the Balkans. fight the\n\n31\n\nForce\n\nW,\n\nas it\n\nwas known, was utterly inadequate to\n\nGermans, comprising two divisions (2nd\n\nAustralian), the 1st\n\nTank Brigade\n\n(of\n\nNew\n\nZealand, 6th\n\n2nd Armored Division), and\n\na small\n\ncommitment of airpower. One German commentator called it \"a drop in the ocean by the standards of continental warfare.\" The commander of the expedition, General Henry Maitland Wilson, was placed in a nearly 32\n\nimpossible position; he had to thrust forward a small force against an\n\nonrushing Wehrmacht coming at him from all directions. The precise placement of the force was a thus a matter of crucial importance, as well as controversy, within the Allied camp. Essentially, the Greek supreme commander, General Alexander Papagos,\n\nwanted the British\n\nas far\n\nnorth\n\nas possible;\n\nMaitland Wilson preferred\n\n33\n\nAgain, like the Yugoslavs, the Greeks were not at all enthusiastic about defending the country at the or relatively narrow waist, Mount Olympus, perhaps, or points south\n\nto stay as far south as he could manage.\n\n—\n\nany position that abandoned a large chunk of it to the invader. Indeed, Papagos was still thinking of the offensive, one last blow to shatter the Italians in Albania.\n\nThe plan that eventually evolved was, worlds. If the\n\nas is typical,\n\nGermans had been advancing from\n\nthe worst of both\n\nBulgaria alone, then\n\n28\n\nChapter One\n\nthe deployment of Force\n\nW\n\nto a defensive position stretching north-\n\nwest-southeast along the Vermion Mountains and Aliakmon River\n\n(it\n\nwas called the \"Vermion line,\" grandiloquently, because there were no prepared works there at all) might have made sense. The operational situation that Maitland Wilson encountered as he marched north, however, was far different. Once again, the Germans had planned a bold operational-level stroke, utilizing the mechanized formations of 12th Army. Although the infantry divisions of XXX Corps crossed the Rhodope Mountains into western Thrace and the XVIII Mountain Corps had the unenviable task of smashing through the well-fortified Metaxas Line along the Bulgarian frontier, 2nd Panzer Division would cross into Yugoslavia toward Strumica. From here it would wheel sharply south, pass just to the west of Lake Doiran on the Greek- Yugoslav border, then drive as rapidly as possible on the major port of Thessaloniki. Seizure of the city would be a strategic blow to the Greeks, cutting off their entire 2nd Army still fighting to the east. Simultaneously, however, there would be an even more dramatic stroke, a westward drive into southern Yugoslavia by XXXX Corps (9th Panzer Division, Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler S.S. Motorized Infantry Regiment, and the 73rd Infantry Division). The corps would drive toward the Vardar River between Skoplje and Veles, then, once again, wheel sharply south, passing through the Monastir Gap and crossing into central Greece from the north. This would result in a linkup with the Italians and the isolation of the Greek 1st Army still fighting in Albania. The Albanian campaign still accounted for the lion's share of the Greek army, some twelve infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and three infantry brigades. Morever, the German maneuver would also fatally compromise the Allied defensive position, outflanking Force no matter what line it happened to occupy. 34 And so it went. As in Operation 25, there was a signal moment at the\n\nW\n\nstart of Marita.\n\nAn April 6,\n\nwas going up in flames,\n\nat virtually\n\nthe same\n\nmoment that Belgrade\n\nLuftwaffe raid on the port of Piraeus scored a direct hit on the 12,000-ton ammunition ship S.S. Clan Fraser.

Windows were shattered seven miles away in Athens. Within hours, German forces were across the Greek border in strength. On the far left, XXX Corps had fairly easy going because much of the Greek force in isolated western Thrace had been evacuated when German troops first entered Buicraft\n\n35\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n(Sal\n\nxxxx\n\n2\n\n29\n\nBulgaria\n\nCUb xvm\n\nfejxxx\n\nAEGEAN SEA\n\nIONIAN (T) Aliakmon Line\n\nSEA\n\n(T) Olympus Position\n\n(T) Thermopylae Line\n\nMap\n\nOperation Marita: Bewegnngskrieg in Greece, April 1941.\n\n2.\n\ngaria.\n\nIn the center,\n\nXVIII Mountain Corps found the Metaxas Line,\n\nand the Greek infantry and gunners defending it, to be as tough as anything they'd yet encountered in this war.

Not only had the maneuver uncovered the communications of the Greek 1st Army in Albania, it had also inserted a strong mobile German force far into the rear of the original British defensive position along the Vermion line. Maitland Wilson could read a map. The news sent the entire Commonwealth force scurrying back down to the south from whence it had come, desperately trying to extricate itself from the jaws of two pursuing German pincers.

The Germans, for their part, managed to keep up the pressure only by sending light pursuit groups ahead of their main\n\nbody. There certainly were not entire Panzer divisions in play during this portion of the campaign. But even the smaller pursuit groups\n\nfound themselves limited by the difficulty of mountainous terrain. At one point they tried, unsuccessfully, to pass a column of tanks single the original European tactifile through the pass at Thermopylae 40 cal exercise, one might say. Even the most celebrated incident of the campaign, the April 26 airdrop onto the isthmus of Corinth by two battalions of the 2nd Fallschirmjager Regiment, failed to seal the deal. Indeed, it met with disaster when a lucky shot detonated charges on the canal bridge, dropping it and killing most of the German paratroopers crossing it, along with the German war correspondent film41 ing the seizure of the bridge. It did not matter one way or another. Most of Force was off the mainland by this time, having already been evacuated from Rafina and Porto Rafti in Attica or from Monemvasia and Kalamata in the Peloponnesus. Athens fell on April 27, and the onrushing Germans swiftly occupied the Peloponnesus on April 28 and 29. The fighting was over by April 30. General Wilhelm List's 12th Army had performed impressively. It had dismantled the Greek army and handed the British another humiliating defeat, driving them into another helter-skelter retreat and forcing them into yet another evacuation that saved the men only at the cost of abandoning virtually all of the equipment.

They then spent the entire war deliberately underreacting to the inthe\n\nhad gleaned from this coup, lest the Germans realize they'd been had and move to some new, more secure system. Even so, the Allies enjoyed as complete an intelligence advantage as any in military history. Likewise, the Allies employed an entire series of highly successful agents, from Richard Sorge in Tokyo to Juan Pujol Garcia to the \"12 apostles\" 47 dispatched by President Roosevelt to North Africa to prepare the ground for the Torch invasion. Even today, the story of Pujol Garcia seems to have been concocted by an overly imagina-\n\ntelligence they\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n33\n\nHollywood screenwriter. Code-named Garbo, he was ostensibly a German agent working in Britain, who fed false information to the very top of the Nazi intelligence chain, up to and including Hitler tive\n\nhimself. For his intelligence reports before the\n\nNormandy\n\ninvasion,\n\nhe received the Reich's highest honors and decorations, including the 48 Iron Cross. The Germans managed nothing like a counterweight to Allied success in this area. Despite the Nazi reputation for fanaticism,\n\nthe democracies and Soviet Russia were far\n\nmore\n\nsuccessful at produc-\n\nand women who were willing to go behind enemy lines and risk life and limb in the battle for information. The German military intelligence office, the Abwehr, by contrast, spent much of the war trying first to overthrow, and then to kill, Hitler. In this war, most of the true believers were on the side of the Allies. The Wehrmacht, in other words, was a military force that cared a great deal for concentric operations but very little for long-term planning. German military planners gave little thought at all to strategic concerns, at least as they have traditionally been conceived in the even rest of the world. Exactly how individual operational victories decisive ones would actually lead to the surrender of their enemies ing\n\nmen\n\n—\n\n—\n\nreceived very\n\nlittle\n\nmans smashed four enemy\n\nNetherlands, Belgium, and France. or even to\n\ncome\n\nMay\n\n1940, for example, the Gerarmies in short order and occupied the\n\nconsideration. In\n\nto terms, Hitler\n\nWhen Britain refused to surrender, and the entire German leadership\n\nwere completely at sea about how to proceed. The Wehrmacht, in a sense, had conquered its way into a strategic impasse. It knew it, and it spent the next year flailing around, searching for a way to move forward. The amount of paperwork generated by such indecision (shared by Hitler and the high command) was prodigious. In the year after Case Yellow, the staff produced plans for no fewer than fifteen major operations: Sea Lion (the invasion of England), Sunflower (the introduction of\n\nNorth Africa), Cyclamen attack on Greece), Felix (the\n\nGerman forces\n\nto\n\nMarita (an seizure of Gibraltar), Isabella (the occupation of Spain and Portugal), a possible invasion of Switzerland, operations against the Canary and Azore Islands, Operation 25 against Yugoslavia, Operation Mercury (the occupation of Albania),\n\noccupy Vichy France, and the establishment of 49 military missions to Romania and Iraq. It wasn't as if there was a lot of downtime in German planning circles during this period. All of this frenzied activity sat uneasily on top of planning the greatest operation against Crete, plans to\n\nin military history: Barbarossa.\n\nwith\n\na gigantic\n\nNor are we talking about the Pentagon,\n\nbureaucratic hive churning out planning documents\n\n34\n\nChapter One\n\n—\n\nby the bushel. German planning staffs were small tiny, in fact. The General Staff had always seen itself as the true German military elite, 50 and keeping itself small was part of the institutional ethos. Although wars are won or lost on the strategic level, the Germans were literally sitting in a conceptual prison. It was all operations, all the time. This was not an issue of trying to think outside the box. German staff officers might not have even been conscious of the fact that there was a box. Bewegungskrieg had worked well enough over the centuries; the Germans actually seemed unaware that there might have been viable alternatives to it. It had become a default setting.\n\nBarbarossa It is\n\nUnion was the Here, a way of war\n\naxiomatic to say that the invasion of the Soviet\n\nultimate test of operational-level Bewegungskrieg.\n\nwin\n\n51\n\ncampaigns in the cozy confines of western Europe, a prosperous region with a highly developed economy and communications infrastructure, found itself very far from home indeed. Here it faced a behemoth, one with room in which to retreat and a manpower pool that was, by German standards at least, limitless. Moreover, the road and rail net was utterly unsatisfactory for a mechanized army that relied so heavily on tanks and other vehicles. It would be untrue to state that planners on the German General Staff were unaware of any of these things. They also knew that the campaign would have to end before the onset of winter. At the same time, however, it was nearly impossible for most of them to conceive of failure. The war was approaching its third year, and no land force had yet come close to stopping them. Although the postwar memoir literature of the German generals is filled with misgivings over Hitler's decision to go east, there was in fact little debate over the wisdom of the move at the time. Most of the staff felt that the overthrow of the Soviet Union would amount to little more than a \"sand table exer52 cise\" a war game. In fact, the Red Army very nearly got the Yugoslav treatment. On June 21, 1941, over 3 million German and Axis troops crossed the Soviet border. Organized into three great army groups (North, Central, and South, heading for Leningrad, Moscow, and the Ukraine, respectively), they had managed to assemble beneath the radar of Soviet intelligence and to achieve not just strategic or operational surprise, but actual tactical surprise as well. As a result, the opening of Operathat had been designed to\n\n—\n\nshort, sharp\n\nFrom Victory to Defeat: 1941\n\n35\n\nRed Army\n\nsenseless,\n\nmethodically encircling and destroying huge Soviet forces\n\nat Bialys-\n\ntion Barbarossa saw the\n\nWehrmacht pound\n\nGermans fought\n\ntok and Minsk.

The resulting level of confusion still boggles the mind.

Likewise, it took months for something like a valid supply system to get up and running. Some Soviet soldiers in those terrible early days actually marched into battle with no food but anchovies, a particularly terrible thing in light of the heat and the lack of drinking water. 57 There is one moment that may stand as representative\n\nof the entire opening phase of Barbarossa: Soviet 8th\n\nMechanized Corps trundling up the single road from Drogobych to Sambor and crashing into Soviet 13th Mechanized Corps, which was, unfortunately, moving from Sambor to Drogobych. The result, need58 less to say, was a traffic jam of epic proportions.

As German ground forces advanced, they would, as always up to this point in the war, have the advantage of operating under an irresistible umbrella of air power. There was progress almost everywhere.
