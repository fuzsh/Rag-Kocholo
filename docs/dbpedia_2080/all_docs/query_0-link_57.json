Putting words to paper is usually done in solitude; collecting the research that underpins the work involves a great many people, as does the creation of the book itself. First, many thanks to Padraic (Pat) Carlin and the staff at ABC-CLIO. They have always been most supportive of the project and are excellent to work with. This is my third book with them on the subject of World War I, and you work with a publisher repeatedly only when the process is as easy as they can make it. Many thanks to my old friend Jack Tunstall, for generously providing documents from his extensive work in the Austrian archives in Vienna. Bruce Gudmundsson also provided material from his impressive collection of material on the army of the Kaiserreich. The staff at the Library of the Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia, was most helpful in tracking down and obtaining works via interlibrary loan. The Marine Corps University Foundation provided generous financial support to facilitate several research trips to Germany. Finally, thanks go to the director of the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, Colonel William McCollough, USMC, as well as the dean of academics, Dr. Doug McKenna, and his successor, Dr. Jonathan Phillips, for their support. Completing a manuscript and publishing it is a time-consuming activity, and the gentlemen mentioned above were always willing to allow me the flexibility in managing my time to bring the project to a successful conclusion, while also fulfilling my own obligations to the Command and Staff College. There are also a great many people to thank on the other side of the pond. The staff at the Zentrum für Militärgeschichte und Sozialwissenschaften der Bundeswehr (ZMSB) library at Potsdam were most helpful, especially in regard to their collection of German regimental histories, always a critical source for anyone writing on World War I. Dr. Martina Haggenmüller of the Bavarian Military Archives was very helpful in regard to obtaining material\n\nxAcknowledgments\n\nconcerning some of the Bavarian units involved in the campaign. Finally, the staff of the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv was extraordinarily helpful in providing documents to me. Many thanks to the staffs of all three institutions for putting up with my not exactly fluent German. Anytime I go to Germany, I always have a great time, thanks to the hospitality of my friends, especially Annie Foerster, Klaus Maier, Detlef and Johanna Vogel, and Jürgen Förster. My friends have always been supportive of these endeavors, so I would like to thank Al, Jay, Pat, Sheila, Scott, Mary, Martin, Dan, Karl, and Karen. The personal and professional often mix. Cynthia Whittaker, a superb scholar of Russian history, was a teacher of mine and a dear friend for over forty years. Two other critical influences were the late William O. Shanahan and the late David Syrett, who was also my Doktorvater. There are many in the fraternity of military historians whose friendship and support I value. Most notable in this regard are Jim Corum and Rob Citino. Most important, however, is my friend of many years, the inimitable Dennis Showalter. Aside from being a prolific writer, Dennis has also been a great mentor. He could always be counted on to give a piece of writing a good sanity check and has always been supportive of so many of us. Since we all stand on his shoulders, this book is dedicated to him. I have the blessing of love and support of two families. My parents, Louis and Ann DiNardo, were always supportive of my choice of career, dubious though it may have seemed. Thanks also to my brothers, Robert and Jerry, and to their respective wives, JoAnn and Vinece. Thanks also to my nephew Michael; my nephew Thomas and his wife, Lisa; my niece, Ann Marie, and her husband, Brian Hardgrove; and the two newest additions to the family, Elani DiNardo and Cliff Hardgrove. The Moxley family of Baltimore, Maryland, has been a source of love and support, especially the Farmer family, David Farmer and Eileen Moxley Farmer and their daughters, Alison and Amanda. The most important Moxley is, of course, my wife, Rita, who is blessed with limitless amounts of love and patience. Although I have mentioned a great many people here, I alone am the author of this book and thus bear sole responsibility for any errors and omissions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTowards the end of March the German G.H.Q. arrived at the firm conviction that it would not be possible for the enemies in the West to force a decision in a measureable time, even if further portions of the formations in process of reconstruction on the Western front had to be used in the East to annihilate the offensive power of the Russians for all time. —Erich von Falkenhayn1 One of the greatest misconceptions of intellectuals, especially those of a Marxist orientation, is that history proceeds in particular direction toward a predetermined outcome. This notion, based on the regarding of history as a linear phenomenon, is both appealing and deceptive. The appeal of such an approach is that it helps the historian explain the course of rather complicated events. At the same time, however, such an approach serves to oversimplify. This is especially true when it comes to military history. It is far too easy, for example, to draw a direct line from Gettysburg to Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox, although some recent scholarship has challenged that notion.2 If there is one human activity that is nonlinear in nature, it is war. Indeed, this is one of the central themes of Carl von Clausewitz’s classic analytic work, On War. Certainly, one conflict that was most nonlinear in its conduct was the First World War. Embarked upon by the major European powers for reasons that ranged from coping with an existential threat (Austria-Hungary), to demonstrating ethnic solidarity (Russia), to an almost paranoid fear about encirclement (Germany), the participants had only the haziest notions as to what they wanted the world to look like after victory had been secured. All of the major powers entered the war with plans that called for a quick victory.3 By the end of 1914, all of the plans had miscarried. Thus as 1915 dawned, all of the belligerents were now faced with the prospect of fighting and winning a prolonged and bloody war. The year\n\nxiiIntroduction\n\nwould certainly see a number of turns in the fortunes of the contending powers. Nowhere was this truer than on the eastern front. The year began with the Central Powers, most notably Austria-Hungary, teetering on the edge of disaster. By the end of the year, the situation had been completely reversed. All of Imperial Russian Poland had been occupied, along with a large part of the Russian Empire’s Baltic provinces. South of the Pripet Marshes, by the end of 1915 the Austro-Hungarians had recovered almost all of the territory lost in the war’s opening campaigns. At the same time, while they were flush with the thrill of victory, the tremendous gains of 1915 raised issues that would produce sharp conflict between Germany and Austria-Hungary, particularly over the issues of further strategic direction of the war and war aims. Such conflicts were exacerbated by personality clashes among the men directing the German and Austro-Hungarian high commands, as well as dissension within the highest echelons of the German military establishment. With regard to military operations, the eastern front in 1915 was marked by a number of interesting facets, especially from the perspective of the Central Powers. First, the northern end of the front was the Baltic coast, one of the few places where there was a realistic possibility for cooperation between the German army and the German navy. In the interests of full disclosure, however, it must be stated here that naval matters will not receive much attention in this book. The conduct of operations on the eastern front in 1915 also revealed the major differences between the German high command (Oberste Heeresleitung or OHL), headed by Erich von Falkenhayn and the top German headquarters in the east, Oberbefehlshaber Ost (Ober Ost), led by the duumvirate of Paul von Hindenburg and his ambitious chief of staff, Erich Ludendorff. Hindenburg and Ludendorff still believed in the notion enshrined in prewar German war planning that a successful offensive campaign could be concluded with a battle of annihilation, completely destroying the enemy force. After all, both the men, but Hindenburg in particular, had come to popular renown in Germany with their crushing victory that destroyed much of the Russian 2nd Army at Tannenberg in August of 1914. The twosome would spend much of 1915 trying to recreate the success of 1914 and arguing that it could be accomplished on a much vaster scale. Falkenhayn would take a much-different approach, based on attacks launched by large forces on relatively narrow fronts. Success would be based on overwhelming the defenses at specific points, creating gaps in the defensive lines that would allow for the resumption of mobile operations. The principal executors of this approach would be August von Mackensen and his much-better-known (at least to casual students of the period) chief of staff, Hans von Seeckt. The rise to prominence of this German military\n\nIntroduction\n\nmarriage must also be seen within the broader conflict between Falkenhayn at OHL and his enemies at Ober Ost. Also playing an important role in the events of 1915 on the eastern front was Austria-Hungary. Peering into the abyss in the late winter of 1915, by the end of the year, Austria-Hungary was still in a difficult situation, although less perilous than before. As usual, the focal point of Austro-Hungarian military efforts was the controversial chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, Franz Baron Conrad von Hötzendorf. Well aware of the increasing need for German aid, Conrad would spend the entire year seeking a victory that Austria-Hungary could claim as its own so that the dual monarchy could still assert a degree of independence from Germany within the Central Powers. Matters were made worse by the relationship between Conrad and Falkenhayn, which was fraught with all manner of difficulties even in the best of times. By the end of the year, the two men were barely on speaking terms, a circumstance that would have deleterious effects on the ability of the Central Powers to conduct the war. For Russia, the year 1915 was also a critical one. The Russian army began the year seemingly on the cusp of success, especially against hated AustriaHungary. Although the northwest front had sustained serious defeats at Tannenberg and First Masurian Lakes, Russian troops still stood on East Prussian soil. Influential figures at the Russian high command (Stavka) were still advocating for another invasion of Germany to the Russian commander-inchief, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. By the end of the year, the Grand Duke, who had to bear the responsibility for defeat, was gone. Sent to the Turkish front in the Caucasus, the Grand Duke was replaced by Tsar Nicholas II, a decision that would have a critical impact on Russia internally. This study will seek to examine these campaigns, which represented the apex of mobile warfare in the period after the opening campaigns, when each side was trying to come to grips with a situation that, while not entirely unanticipated, was still very much uncharted territory. Success in 1915 on the eastern front was by no means assured for either side at the start. Triumph and failure depended upon the ability of each side to harness man power, technology, and tactics in ways that would break the deadlock and allow for the resumption of mobile warfare. We must begin with a brief recounting of the campaigns of 1914, to provide the proper background and context for the present study. Before embarking on that endeavor, however, several matters must be dealt with. The first concerns the geographic scope of this study. The area encompassed in this work begins at the Baltic coast and then runs south through the present-day Baltic States, Poland, and Ukraine, with the Black Sea as its southern terminus. Thus, the present work will not cover operations in the Caucasus between Russia and Turkey.4 Nor will this work cover the Serbian campaign\n\nxiii\n\nxivIntroduction\n\nof 1915. Although the decision to mount the campaign had an effect on and was impacted by events on the eastern front, it was a separate operation. While certainly an interesting campaign, the invasion will not be covered here, although it has received some deserved attention recently.5 Another matter to be dealt with is the delineation of units. Since the movements and actions of armies from three countries are going to be described and analyzed, some departure from normal convention is in order to aid the reader in differentiation. German and Austro-Hungarian field armies, such as the German Eleventh Army or Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army, will be rendered in this manner. Russian field armies will be described with Arabic numerals, as in the Russian 11th Army. Corps for both sides will be described with Roman numerals, plus any other geographic or military descriptors. Thus, one will see units described as German XXXXI Reserve Corps or the Russian II Siberian Corps. Divisions and Regiments will be described using Arabic numerals throughout. The names of German and Austro-Hungarian officers will be rendered in German fashion. Thus, the name of the German emperor will be rendered as Wilhelm II, not William II. Likewise, the name of the Austro-Hungarian commander-in-chief will be rendered as Archduke Friedrich, not Frederick. German and Austro-Hungarian general officer ranks will be rendered in the original German terms. Thus, for example, the chief of staff for the German Eleventh Army will be rendered as Generalmajor Hans von Seeckt, not Major General Hans von Seeckt. On the last page of this book there will be a table of German and Austro-Hungarian general officer ranks and their American and Russian equivalents. Likewise, Russian names will be rendered in the Russian fashion. Thus, the Russian commander-in-chief is Grand Duke Nikolai, not Grand Duke Nicholas. Finally, as is inevitable with any work on this area of the world during this time, one must deal with the issue of place names. The most notable example of this is the capital city of Austrian Galicia, which can be rendered as Lemberg (Austrian), Lviv (Ukrainian), Lvov (Russian) or Łwow (Polish). Further north, one can use either Posen (German) or Poznan (Polish), and the list is endless. For the purposes of this work, the place names used will be those used in 1915. This will serve to keep it simple and make the work more accessible to a broader audience. Now that the necessary administrative details have been dispensed with, we can embark on our study. That will begin with a brief discussion of the prewar plans of the combatants and the results that followed their being put into action.\n\nMackensen’s advance on Przemysl, May 1915.

Long-term antagonism between Russia and Austria-Hungary, dating from the Crimean War, could bring the two empires into conflict. Recognizing this, German\n\n2\n\nTurning Points\n\nchancellor Otto von Bismarck sought to minimize this possibility by cobbling together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia in the League of the Three Emperors.5 The league, however, came apart after a few years. Tension among the empires grew when Russia went to war against Turkey in support of Bulgarian independence. After Russia’s military victory in 1878, with the support of other European powers at the Congress of Berlin, Bismarck was able to impose on the Russians modifications to the Treaty of San Stefano. With anti-German feelings in Russia running high and the league in ruins, Bismarck went to his next best option: signing a long-term alliance with AustriaHungary on October 7, 1879.6 The creation of the dual alliance with Austria-Hungary raised the possibility of joint war planning. Although Germany now had a political alliance with Austria-Hungary, it was not accompanied by a formal military convention. In September 1882, the chief of the German General Staff, Generalfeldmarschall Helmuth von Moltke, met the Austro-Hungarian chief of the General Staff, Generaloberst Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky. Beck proposed just such an agreement, and Moltke, urged on by his then deputy Alfred von Waldersee, accepted the proposal. Before a written agreement could be drawn up, however, the project was scotched by Bismarck’s strenuous objections.7 Although he acceded to Bismarck on this occasion, Moltke also told Beck that his latitude in military planning did not depend on the Foreign Ministry. Moltke also rationalized that as long as the two allies kept each other informed about their respective plans, each army could conduct its own campaign.8 This loose relationship between the two general staffs continued through the 1880s, reinforced perhaps by diplomatic events. Bismarck sought to resurrect the League of Three Emperors, and negotiations were well advanced by 1881. Reinforced in urgency by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II on March 1, 1881, the Second League of Three Emperors was signed on June 18, 1881.9 Although the league was renewed in 1884, a resumption of tensions between Austria-Hungary and Russia over Bulgaria in 1885 resulted in the collapse of the arrangement the following year. With the idea of a multilateral arrangement including Russia now dead, Bismarck went to his only alternative: signing a secret bilateral agreement with Russia, the Reinsurance Treaty, in 1887.10 During Moltke and Beck’s era, Germany and Austria envisioned a simple war-planning concept in regard to Russia based on the shape of the existing borders. While the German army would stand on the defensive in the west against France, complimentary offensives would be launched from Germany and Austria-Hungary into the westward jutting salient of Russian Poland.11 The period 1888–1891 was a momentous one for German diplomacy and war planning. Wilhelm I died on March 9, 1888. His successor, Crown\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nPrince Friedrich, ascended to the throne as Emperor Friedrich III. Already stricken with throat cancer, Friedrich III died on June 15, 1888. The death of Friedrich III after only one hundred days on the throne meant that the German Empire was now in the hands of Wilhelm II, the twenty-nine-year-old son of Friedrich III. Differences in age and personality alone almost guaranteed that the new kaiser and the aging chancellor would have differences. Above all, Wilhelm II demanded loyalty, something that the aging and imperious Bismarck, who by now spent most of his time at his Friedrichsruh estate, would not give.12 Not surprisingly, the relationship between the two men soured quickly. Each man accurately characterized the other. Bismarck, already warned by Wilhelm I and Friedrich III, thought the new kaiser to be shallow, impulsive, and immature. Wilhelm II, for his part, lacked intellect but was capable at times of shrewd judgments about people. Wilhelm II regarded Bismarck, then in his midseventies, to be high-handed, arrogant, and inflexible.13 Ultimately, given Wilhelm’s position, there could be only one resolution to the problem. In a dispute over domestic policy, Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck on March 16, 1890. With Bismarck now gone, the course of German foreign policy changed considerably, starting with the lapse of the Reinsurance Treaty in the summer of 1890. Russian foreign policy, influenced by Pan-Slavist thinkers and diplomats, now moved almost inexorably toward an alliance with France, which was consummated in 1894.14 The prospect of Germany facing a twofront war was now a reality. While Germany was going through considerable changes in the directors of its foreign policy, similar changes were occurring in the military. Moltke, the military architect of the Kaiserreich, retired in 1888. His successor was Alfred von Waldersee, who, although an able military officer, was also given to political intrigue. An opponent of Bismarck, Waldersee welcomed Bismarck’s departure.15 Like Bismarck, however, Waldersee also ran afoul of the kaiser. Waldersee found Wilhelm II’s impulsiveness rather unsettling. Waldersee’s enemies within the government reinforced the principle of civilian control over the military; most notable of these enemies was the new chancellor, Leo von Caprivi, who agreed with that principle even though he was a former general. This was done through issuing subordinating military attachés to the Foreign Ministry instead of the General Staff. Wilhelm II ultimately decided in favor of the Foreign Ministry, a serious bureaucratic defeat for Waldersee. The final straw was Waldersee’s scathing critique of the kaiser’s performance in the autumn maneuvers of 1890. Wilhelm was never one to take criticism gracefully, and Waldersee was effectively demoted to command of a corps in January 1891.16 For the position of chief of the General Staff, Wilhelm appointed Alfred von Schlieffen, one of Waldersee’s deputies. Although Moltke, very late in his\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTurning Points\n\ntenure, developed a plan for more of the German army to deploy to the west against France, the general concept of his plan remained the same: to stand on the defensive in the west, while undertaking a limited offensive in the east. Waldersee continued this general apportionment, although he took a more offensive approach in both the east and the west.17 Schlieffen would take a much-different approach. However, the tendency for foreign policy and military planning to be conducted in relative isolation from each other remained unchanged. Schlieffen was also circumspect enough to avoid involving himself in political matters.18 Schlieffen was not only confronted with the distinct possibility of a twofront war but was also facing a much-improved and -expanded French army. By 1896, Schlieffen clearly regarded France as the most dangerous of Germany’s potential opponents. In addition, fearing the prospect of an openended campaign in the vast spaces of Russia, Schlieffen reoriented the focus of German war planning to the west.19 A detailed examination of Schlieffen’s concept of a quick-victory offensive against France is outside the scope of this study.20 From the standpoint of this study, the most important impact of Schlieffen’s appointment was on the relationship between the German and Austro-Hungarian general staffs. During Moltke’s tenure, communications with the Austro-Hungarian General Staff were fairly regular, conducted normally by correspondence, punctuated with the occasional personal meeting. This practice continued during Waldersee’s brief tenure as chief.21 Once Schlieffen took the reins and began to shift the focus of German war planning to the west, communications between the general staffs began to assume a more intermittent character. Beck’s first meeting with Schlieffen, at Moltke’s funeral in 1891, did not go well. Beck found Schlieffen to be laconic and not forthcoming at all. Thereafter, Schlieffen gave Beck no indication of the changes he was instituting to the German war plans, although it should be pointed out that Schlieffen was under no obligation to do this, given the absence of a military convention. By the end of Schlieffen’s term in office, the nature of communications between the two general staffs could best be described as merely obligatory, such as the exchange of holiday greetings.22 It seemed certain that relations would improve in 1906. In 1903, now in his seventies and in declining health, Schlieffen asked Wilhelm II to consider appointing a replacement. The search for Schlieffen’s successor produced some odd moments, including one candidate, Generalfeldmarschall Count Dietrich von Hülsen-Haeseler, dying in a rather embarrassing situation. Ultimately, the choice for chief of the General Staff fell to Generaloberst Helmuth von Moltke, a nephew of the victor of 1866 and 1870.23 The transition from Schlieffen to Moltke was matched by a similar process in Vienna. Although he had tried to modernize and expand the AustroHungarian army, Beck’s vision of the army as an institution was more\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nnineteenth century than twentieth. Beck had also run afoul of Francis Joseph’s heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who exerted powerful influence in military matters. After a poorly conducted maneuver in the fall of 1906, Francis Joseph, at the likely urging of Franz Ferdinand, dismissed Beck. The new chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff was Generaloberst Franz Baron Conrad von Hötzendorf.24 To be sure, relations did improve, although given the circumstances at the end of 1905, the bar was set at a low level. Moltke and Conrad met personally in Berlin in May 1907. Thereafter they corresponded regularly, and Conrad attended the German army’s 1909 fall maneuvers at Bad Mergentheim.25 The improved relations still only went so far. Moltke was apparently ignorant of the difficulties that confronted the Austro-Hungarian army. For example, in 1913, Moltke, who shared many of the racial prejudices held by many at the court in Berlin including the kaiser, projected that the next war would be one of “Germandom versus Slavdom.” In response, Conrad was forced to point out that some 47 percent of the dual monarchy’s inhabitants were Slavic.26 Although by this time the main effort of the German war plan was focused on France, Moltke refused to provide any real detail to Conrad. For his part, Conrad continued to rely on a vague promise from Moltke in 1909 in regard to a German offensive on the Narew River in Russian Poland, even though Moltke clearly told Conrad in a February 10, 1913, letter that in the event of war, “the fate of Austria will not be decided on the Bug, but ultimately on the Seine.”27 The idea of sharing plans more fully took a major blow with the Redl affair. In 1900, the Russian intelligence service was able to catch wind of the homosexuality of Colonel Alfred Redl, an Austro-Hungarian staff officer who had occupied a number of critical billets, including as head of the Evidenzbüro, the army’s counterintelligence service. After ensnaring Redl in a planned seduction while on a trip to Kazan, the Russians confronted Redl with compromising photos. Although the Russian intelligence service in Poland, headed by Colonel Nikolai Batyushin, had the leverage of blackmail over Redl, the Russians also paid the normally impecunious officer considerable sums of money, thus enabling a rather lavish lifestyle.28 Redl apparently gave the Russians a tremendous amount of material, although at least one scholar has questioned this. Of particular interest to the Russians were the Austro-Hungarian mobilization and war plans that Redl provided. Austrian suspicions were aroused when the Russian press foolishly discussed Austrian plans. Ultimately, sheer mischance brought about Redl’s undoing. Redl received his payments in cash through the mail, sent by his Russian handlers from Germany. In April 1913, when one package that Redl had failed to claim in time was sent back to Germany, postal officials opened it and, finding a large amount of cash, alerted the German authorities. The Germans duly passed this on to the Evidenzbüro, which launched an investigation.29\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTurning Points\n\nOn May 24, 1913, Redl picked up a payment at the post office and was tracked to the Hotel Klomser in Vienna. Once in his room, he was confronted by a group of officers, including the head of the Evidenzbüro, Colonel August Urbanski ´ von Ostyrmiecz, who presented Redl with the evidence against him and arrested him. Urbanski ´ informed Conrad of Redl’s arrest while he was dining at the Grand Hotel in Vienna. Conrad’s immediate reaction was to launch a cover-up and thus avoid the embarrassing spectacle of a public trial. He ordered that Redl be interrogated to find out the extent of his espionage and then be allowed to commit suicide. After questioning him, Redl’s one-time protégé Captain Max Ronge left a pistol with one round in the room. Redl took the hint and shot himself in the early morning hours of May 25, 1913.30 Conrad’s attempt at covering up the Redl affair blew up in his face almost immediately. The press got wind of the matter, and the exposure of the details of Redl’s private life made for lurid reading in the Viennese papers. Conrad sought to minimize the damage of the Redl affair in his explanations to Austrian foreign minister Leopold von Berchtold and to Moltke. Responding to an inquiry from Berchtold, Conrad assured him that while Redl’s activity had caused serious damage, it would not affect the outcome of a war, presumably one against Serbia. While Conrad had failed to keep the Redl scandal under wraps, he was more successful in concealing the scope of Redl’s activities from the Germans. To some degree, Conrad’s ignorance was of his own volition. The lone interrogation that Conrad had authorized had not yielded much information. Thus, the only thing Conrad could do was to assure Moltke that Redl could not have betrayed “the whole of their private correspondence.” Understandably, Moltke did not find this comforting. It did, however, give him all the more reason to withhold as much detail about the German war plan as possible from the Austro-Hungarians.31 The result was that when the war began, Germany and Austria-Hungary pursued what might be called “parallel warfare” instead of coalition warfare. Although the two powers were fighting the same set of enemies, each pursued its own war plan. Using Schlieffen’s concept with Moltke’s modifications, the Germans would make their main effort in the west against France. In the east, Generaloberst Max von Prittwitz and Gaffron’s German Eighth Army, consisting of the I, XVII, XX, and I Reserve Corps with the 1st Cavalry Division and various Landwehr and garrison units, had orders simply to defend East Prussia against an expected Russian offensive.32 Confronted with their own two-front war against Russia and Serbia, the Austro-Hungarians developed a complicated scheme that depended on good timing and equally good judgment. Since the most common scenario envisioned going to war against both Russia and Serbia, deploying forces would be allocated accordingly. Echelon A, consisting of twenty-eight infantry\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\ndivisions divided among the First, Third, and Fourth Armies, would be committed to the Russian border. Minimal Group Balkan, consisting of the Fifth and Sixth Armies (XIII, XV, and XVI Corps), would be deployed along the border with Serbia. Echelon B, the Second Army (IV, VII, VIII, and IX Corps), would go to either to Galicia, Serbia, or the Italian border, as circumstances required.33 Russian war planning was greatly impacted by a vicious factional squabble over long-term control of Russian military policy. One faction, headed by the controversial war minister Vladimir A. Sukhomlinov, was more inclined toward reform in the broadest sense. Sukhomlinov’s opponents were a coterie of officers who were close to Tsar Nicholas II’s cousin Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. While not the complete reactionaries that they have often been portrayed as, they took a very different approach to the matters of reform and military policy, particularly on the strategic issue of fortresses.34 The almost constant clash between the two factions soon extended into the matter of war planning. Russian planning revolved around the prospect of a war that Russia feared that it would have to fight and one that Russia preferred to fight. It was war against Germany that concerned the Russian military. These concerns were heighted in the period after the Russo-Japanese War, which left the Russian army in a very poor state. Indeed, the threat of German military action during the Bosnian Crisis in 1908 forced Russia to back away from the prospect of war against Austria-Hungary. At the Franco-Russian staff talks in 1911, the Russians admitted that an early offensive against Germany was not within the realm of possibility. The Russian government also made sure that the roads near the German border were poorly maintained, lest they facilitate a German advance into Russian Poland.35 After the post-1905 reforms, the Main Directorate of the Russian General Staff was the agency most responsible for planning. Given that the organization responsible for planning was a relatively new creation, the process of war planning in Russia was not nearly as well developed as in Germany. Instead of detailed war plans, the Main Directorate of the General Staff produced numbered mobilization plans.36 By early 1914, the Russian mobilization plan was Mobilization Schedule 19. The mobilization schedules were further developed into two variants: A for Austria-Hungary and G for Germany. As Mobilization Schedule 19G was not complete in July 1914, 19A was the mobilization schedule adopted. It called for the deployment of thirty infantry and nine and one-half cavalry divisions against Germany, while some forty-six and one-half infantry and eighteen and one-half cavalry divisions would be sent to the Austro-Hungarian border.37 Once the initial period of mobilization was over, Russian war planning was hampered by a lack of focus and clashing factions within the General Staff and the War Ministry. Sukhomlinov and his chief assistant, General\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTurning Points\n\nYuri N. Danilov, argued for the earliest possible offensive against Germany. Since the majority of the German forces were expected to be committed to an offensive against France, both men believed that it was imperative that Russia do something to alleviate German pressure on Russia’s ally, in keeping with the stipulations of the Franco-Russian alliance. In addition, at least early on, given that the Russians would enjoy superiority in the size of forces, attacking the German forces in East Prussia at the start would give Russia its best prospect for success.38 The opposing faction, headed by General Mikhail V. Alekseev, chief of staff of the Kiev Military District and a former member of the General Staff, took a different view. He regarded the Balkans as Russia’s primary area of interest and thus gave higher priority to the defeat of Austria-Hungary. Alekseev argued further that a quick and decisive victory over Austria-Hungary would also force Germany to divert forces from the west. In addition, a rapid knockout of the dual monarchy would provide a powerful inducement for neutral countries in the Balkans to join the Entente against the presumably vulnerable Central Powers. Thus, by Alekseev’s thinking, the easiest route for Russia to Berlin was via Vienna.39 Given competing factions and ideas, plus the lack of a mechanism and a process for detailed planning beyond mobilization, it is perhaps not surprising that plans for actual operations fell between two stools. In response to the difficult operational terrain of East Prussia, Danilov’s concept required four field armies. The implementation of Alekseev’s idea likewise demanded the preponderance of Russia’s mobilized forces. On February 12, 1912, the chiefs of staff of Russia’s frontier military districts with General Staff planners held a conference but failed to arrive at any clear resolution of the question. Ultimately, the Russian army would try to execute both concepts with fewer forces.40 The process by which Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary went to war in 1914 lies beyond the scope of this work.41 In the actual event, all of the war plans miscarried to varying degrees and in different ways. The failure of the Schlieffen plan with Molke’s modifications is well known.42 The German war plan for the eastern front also failed, although in subtle ways. Prittwitz’s German Eighth Army got off to a rough start at Gumbinnen, although Prittwitz’s plans were deranged to some degree by the actions of the I Corps commander, the obstreperous Hermann von François.43 The resulting setback at Gumbinnen caused Prittwitz sufficient worry that he initially ordered the Eighth Army to retreat all the way to the Vistula River, effectively ceding much of East Prussia to the Russians. Although he reversed himself quickly, the initial decision conveyed to Moltke the impression that Prittwitz had lost control of both the situation and himself. Already in a difficult situation at Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL) in the west, Moltke had to act, and he relieved both Prittwitz and the Eighth Army’s chief of staff,\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nGeorg von Waldersee. The latter relief was somewhat embarrassing for Moltke; Waldersee had been Moltke’s deputy on the General Staff prior to the outbreak of war.44 To command the Eighth Army, Moltke put together one of the most famous military marriages in German military history. The Eighth Army’s new chief of staff was the hard-driving and ambitious Erich Ludendorff. Born on April 9, 1865, in Kruszevnia, a rural village near Posen in East Prussia, Ludendorff attended one of the lesser known Kadettenschulen at Plön.45 After enjoying a career marked by distinction, including attending the Kriegsakademie in 1890, and a number of staff appointments, Ludendorff was assigned to the General Staff in Berlin in 1904. This brought him into association with Moltke, who by that time was one of Schlieffen’s deputies.46 At the onset of war, Ludendorff, then with the staff of the German Second Army, distinguished himself at the siege of Liege. Leading several brigades in an infiltration attack that penetrated between the heavily manned forts, Ludendorff seized the lightly defended citadel in a coup de main, an action that earned him Germany’s highest award, the pour le mérite.47 With the perceived crisis in the east at hand and a new command team needed, Moltke thought Ludendorff was just the man to be the new chief of staff. Thus, on the evening of August 22, Ludendorff was summoned to OHL, then located at Koblenz. Arriving at six o’clock the next morning, Moltke briefed Ludendorff on his new mission and sent him off to pick up the new Eighth Army commander in Hanover while on route to East Prussia.48 The new commander of the Eighth Army was the recently retired Paul von Hindenburg.49 Born on October 2, 1847, in Posen, Hindenburg entered the Kadettenschule in Liegnitz in 1859. As a young officer, Hindenburg served in both the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars. After graduating from the Kriegsakademie in 1876, Hindenburg enjoyed a solid, if unspectacular, march up the ranks of the German army. Once considered a possible successor to Schlieffen, Hindenburg retired on January 9, 1911. Hindenburg was reactivated on August 22, 1914, and appointed commander of the Eighth Army.50 To be sure, the choices for the new command team of the Eighth Army were Moltke’s. Wilhelm II was not particularly enamored with either man and regarded Hindenburg as simpleminded. Hindenburg was far too stolid a personality and lacked the kind of dash that Wilhelm found so attractive. Finally, Hindenburg had made the signal mistake of not letting the kaiser’s side win in the annual 1908 maneuvers. Although Ludendorff had received his pour le mérite from Wilhelm II personally, the kaiser disliked the highly strung Ludendorff and thought of him as an unscrupulous social climber who lacked breeding. The kaiser’s acquiescence here was just one more example of his prewar promise to Moltke to stay out of day-to-day military matters.51\n\n9\n\n10\n\nTurning Points\n\nMore deranging to the German war plan was what Moltke sent to the Eighth Army after dispatching Hindenburg and Ludendorff to East Prussia. After several days of deliberation, even with the situation in the west approaching its climax, Moltke decided to send the XI Corps and the Guard Reserve Corps, now available after the successful conclusion of the siege of Namur, to reinforce the Eighth Army.52 In the actual event, the presence of these two corps did not matter, as they did not get to East Prussia in time to participate in the Tannenberg operation. The Austro-Hungarian war plan produced results that could only be described as utterly unsuccessful. The Austro-Hungarian forces invading Serbia, consisting of the Austro-Hungarian Fifth and Sixth Armies, were commanded by Feldzugmeister Oskar Potiorek, the governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A rival to Conrad, Potiorek was responsible for the security arrangements in Sarajevo when Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife came for their ill-fated visit. After the onset of hostilities, Potiorek launched two invasions of Serbia, in August and September, respectively, both of which came to grief at the hands of the Serbian forces commanded by Radomir Putnik. A third effort, launched to retrieve both Austria-Hungary’s military fortunes and Potiorek’s career, enjoyed some initial success when it captured Belgrade. An overly optimistic Potiorek presented the city as a jubilee gift to Francis Joseph.53 Potiorek’s third effort, however, also came to a bad end, as a Serbian counterattack drove the Austro-Hungarian forces back over the Save and Danube Rivers. The three Austro-Hungarian offensives against Serbia were complete failures. Although the Serbian armies had suffered considerably, losing about 163,000 dead, wounded, and captured, the Austro-Hungarians lost far more. Potiorek’s forces lost some 30,000 dead, 173,000 wounded, and 70,000 captured. The final casualty was Potiorek’s career. He was dismissed from his position on December 22, 1914, and was forced into retirement on January 1, 1915.54 Far worse was to come on the Russian front. Unlike the Serbian front, where Conrad was willing to leave Potiorek to his own devices (and suffer the consequences of any failures), he took a much more hands-on approach to the matter of Russia. On August 16, 1914, Conrad established headquarters for Armee Ober Kommando (AOK) at the fortress and communication hub of Przemy´sl. From there, Conrad with Archduke Friedrich (his nominal superior) would direct his armies.55 Conrad’s efforts were undone by his own errors and misjudgments. The very first error was the result of Conrad’s own indecision. Even though it seemed that Russian intervention was inevitable, Conrad decided to send the Second Army to the Serbian border. Although Conrad reversed himself, it was too late to recall the trains. Conrad had the Second Army go to the Serbian, detrain, and then reentrain to come back to Galicia. Once at the\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nSerbian border, however, Conrad let some of the Second Army’s corps become involved in Potiorek’s initial offensive against Serbia. Thus, while part of the Second Army’s strength was frittered away on the Save River, an understrength Second Army ultimately arrived too late to prevent the unsatisfactory outcome in Galicia.56 In addition to undercutting the strength of his own forces facing the Russians, Conrad made two other errors. First, perhaps as a response to the Redl revelations, Conrad moved the deployment areas for his armies in Galicia farther away from the frontiers than had been called for in the original war plans. Thus, his soldiers would have to make a much-longer march to the Russian border, under the difficult conditions of the Galician summer.57 Conrad’s second error was borne of his aggressive nature. Although he knew that his armies in Galicia would be even more inferior numerically since he had retained at least two corps from the Second Army on the Serbian front, Conrad’s bias for the offensive prompted him to decide to attack anyway. With an additional hundred-mile march for his infantry, cavalry ill equipped to perform the critical function of reconnaissance, and a typically underfunded aviation component, Conrad’s armies blundered forward blindly into the enemy.58 Although the Austro-Hungarian First Army commander, General der Infanterie Viktor Freiherr von Dankl, would win an initial hard-fought-ifcostly victory at Krásnik, the success was illusory. Russian strength began to increase as the southwest front completed its mobilization. By the beginning of September 1914, Russian 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th Armies were considerably stronger than their exhausted and depleted Austro-Hungarian opponents.59 Thus, it would be fair to say that by the middle of September 1914, as Conrad was pulling his armies back to the San River, the Austro-Hungarian war plan was in ruins. The results produced by the Russian mobilization process were perhaps more positive than normally thought. Prodded by the French, the Russian high command, headed by Grand Duke Nikolai, rushed the northwest front into an offensive against East Prussia. Following Mobilization Schedule 19A, General Yakov Zhilinski’s northwest front armies (Pavel Rennenkampf’s 1st and Aleksandr Samsonov’s 2nd) began their offensive operations well before the Germans expected, even before their own mobilization was complete. Consequently, the two armies went forward with inadequate cavalry, thus leaving them with insufficient resources for reconnaissance, a capability essential for a campaign in East Prussia.60 The course of the Tannenberg campaign is too well known to need to repeat here.61 Although the Russian XIII and XV Corps were destroyed and the XXIII Corps was severely mauled, costing the Russians about 165,000 casualties (including 92,000 prisoners), substantial parts of the 2nd Army escaped the Tannenberg disaster. The II Corps was incorporated into\n\n11\n\n12\n\nTurning Points\n\nRennenkampf’s 1st Army, which was still ensconced on German soil. Meanwhile the Russian I and VI Corps were able to create a strong defensive position on the Narew River, covering Warsaw, where a new 2nd Army would be created. Farther south, matters went considerably better for the Russians. The somewhat slower pace of Russian mobilization allowed the armies of the southwest front to absorb the casualties suffered in the initial battles of Krásnik and Komarów. In addition, the open nature of the terrain on the Russian side of the border provided ample space for the Russian armies to fully deploy their strength, swallowing up the numerically inferior Austro-Hungarian armies.62 Finally, the operational geography favored the Russians on the Austro-Hungarian side of the border. The southwest front’s armies could aim concentric attacks at Przemy´sl, thus giving all of Ivanov’s forces a common objective.63 Thus, by the late summer of 1914 on the eastern front, the only war plan that was still in play, at least marginally, was Russia’s. As summer gave way to autumn, both sides had to recalibrate their plans, forces, and commanders. For the Germans and Austro-Hungarians, the issue of command in coalition warfare and relations between them raised its head in various ways. Relations between the Germans and Austro-Hungarians, not great to begin with, deteriorated considerably. Karl Graf von Kaganeck, the German military attaché in Vienna, urged Waldersee (then Moltke’s deputy) for the German high command to be completely honest with the AustroHungarians about the Schlieffen Plan. In addition, both Germany and Austria-Hungary were slow in dispatching representatives to each other’s headquarters. It was not until August 4, 1914, that they agreed to the exchange, and the Austro-Hungarian representative, Count Josef von Stürgkh, did not depart Vienna until August 7.64 Once they were in their respective posts, the opacity continued. Stürgkh, installed at OHL, received little information about the progress of operations in Belgium and France. Neither he nor Conrad were made aware of the deterioration of Moltke’s condition, both mentally and physically. To add insult to injury, OHL did not inform Conrad that Moltke had been removed from his position and was replaced by Erich von Falkenhayn. Conrad, for his part, called for Hindenburg and Ludendorff to launch an offensive against the Russian forces in northern Poland. As the German Eighth Army had to do some refitting of its own after Tannenberg and Rennenkampf’s Russian 1st Army was still ensconced on German soil, Conrad’s suggestion was rebuffed, with Wilhelm II personally relating this to Stürgkh.65 Another issue that came to the fore was that of unified command. As noted previously, the Austro-German alliance had no military convention associated with it, and the elder Moltke at least implied that there was no real need for one.66 As the scale and complexity of the forces and plans involved increased, the matter of a unified command always lay just below the\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nsurface. By 1914, there were a couple of different approaches to the question. Ideally, one of the two monarchs would exercise overall command in the east, but that was impossible. Francis Joseph was far too old and in poor health, and Wilhelm II was precluded by the element of his erratic personality. In addition, the kaiser had already promised Moltke that he would refrain from interfering in day-to-day military matters, something of which the Austro-Hungarians may not have been aware.67 Conrad also apparently desired the position, if it was ever to be created. This quickly became an impossibility, especially after Hindenburg gained the stature accorded him as the victor of Tannenberg. The idea of having any German general in overall command, let alone Hindenburg, was anathema at both AOK and the Ballplatz. Thus, the issue continued unresolved.68 As September wore on, the operational focus on the eastern front shifted to the north and the south. The German Eighth Army, now with the XI Corps and Guard Reserve Corps in hand, turned against Rennenkampf’s 1st Army. The offensive, which began on September 9, 1914, after two days of probes, went forward but at a slow pace. Already badly spooked by Tannenberg, Rennenkampf was not about to let himself get caught in another encirclement. The 1st Army beat their feet for the border. By the third week of September, the 1st Army, pursued by Hindenburg’s forces, had reached the safety of the Nieman River.69 Matters farther south went much more in the favor of the Russians. With the mobilization of Ivanov’s southwest front just about complete, by the end of August, the Russians were ready to go over to the offensive against the already depleted Austro-Hungarian armies. After a few days of tough fighting, Alexei Brusilov’s 8th and Nikolai Ruszki’s 3rd Armies got the upper hand along the Gnila Lipa and Zlota Lipa Rivers. By August 31, 1914, the Russians had torn a hole nine miles across in the Austro-Hungarian line. Through the first week of September, the Austro-Hungarian armies in Galicia tried to cling to their positions, as the key battle developed around Rawa Ruska. Ultimately, the Austro-Hungarians had too many gaps and overlapped flanks to deal with. The Russian victory at Rawa Ruska was both a military disaster and a personal tragedy for Conrad. Not only did the AustroHungarian defeat mark the end of Conrad’s plans, but also one of the AustroHungarian fatalities at Rawa Ruska was Conrad’s son Herbert, killed in action on September 8, 1914.70 Faced with the potential destruction of the Austro-Hungarian Third Army, Conrad had no choice but to pull back his battered armies toward the San. Once they reached the river, however, the Austro-Hungarian retreat had to continue on to the Dunajec and Biala Rivers. In the process, Conrad had to abandon Lemberg and the critical Galician oil fields to the Russians. In addition, Conrad decided to reinforce the fortress of Przemy´sl so that it could withstand a Russian siege, while he shifted AOK’s location to Neu Sandec.71\n\n13\n\n14\n\nTurning Points\n\nConrad’s forces were now forced back between the San and the Carpathian Mountains, but with East Prussia almost entirely cleared, the Central Powers could act in concert, at least to some degree. On September 15, 1914, OHL created a new German field army, the Ninth, out of most of the corps of the Eighth Army. Seeing the chance to break up Hindenburg-Ludendorff duumvirate, Falkenhayn named Generaloberst Richard von Schubert as commander, with Ludendorff as his chief of staff.72 Ludendorff, however, successfully lobbied OHL that Hindenburg be the commander of the Ninth Army, given that it would have the preponderance of German forces on the eastern front. Hindenburg was appointed commander of the Ninth Army on September 18, 1914, while Schubert took command of the Eighth Army.73 Meanwhile Conrad, with his armies backed up between the San River and the Carpathian Mountains, was able to scrape enough man power together to reinforce his armies to a “respectable” strength with 477,000 infantry, 26,000 cavalry, and 1,578 guns.74 Although the Central Powers were now acting in a unified manner, the issue of command and mutual understanding came up again, and in a negative way. Although Ludendorff and Conrad had their first meeting at Neu Sandec on September 18, 1914, and would develop a good relationship in a personal sense, a number of Germans, including Ludendorff, could not resist from indulging in an orgy of “I told you so.” Ludendorff privately could not refrain from noting that while Conrad had been critical of German methods before the war, the actual experience of combat had led to a change of mind. Max Hoffmann perceptively noted that the Austro-Hungarians were now paying a high price for years of parsimony. Such attitudes were common among high-ranking German officers.75 The issue of command remained thorny. Although once it was deployed, the German Ninth Army would be operating on the left end of a line with the Austro-Hungarian First, Fourth, and Third Armies, Hindenburg’s force would operate independently, answering solely to OHL. To add insult to injury, the plan of Hindenburg’s army would force Dankl’s Austro-Hungarian First Army to shift its advance in order to cover Hindenburg’s right flank. This was much to Conrad’s irritation, but given the circumstances that now obtained on the eastern front, it could not be avoided.76 From the standpoint of the Central Powers, the impending offensive was well timed. In their retreat, the Austro-Hungarian forces had been able to put some distance between themselves and the armies of Ivanov’s southwest front. With the Russian pursuit running out of steam, Ivanov called off the pursuit on September 23, 1914, and ordered his forces to transition to defense along the San. Meanwhile Brusilov, now controlling both the Russian 3rd and 8th Armies, devoted a sizable part of the 3rd Army to besieging Przemy´sl, especially after an attempt to take the fortress by storm foundered with heavy casualties. Even just establishing a complete investment of the fortress took\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\ntime; they did not complete that task until September 23, 1914. The rest of Ivanov’s forces shifted their weight toward Poland.77 The autumn campaign in Poland during September and October 1914 was an excellent example of Carl von Clausewitz’s description of war as a clash of two living organisms. The Ninth Army’s drive, assisted by the AustroHungarian First Army, was aimed initially at what Hindenburg and Ludendorff thought was the flank of the Russian southwest front, supposedly located on Middle Vistula.78 The offensive got off to a good start, with a hardwon victory at Opatow at the end of September. The Russian forces opposing the Ninth Army appeared to be no more than two infantry divisions and seven cavalry divisions, so Hindenburg and Ludendorff set their sights higher. The Ninth Army would now drive across the Vistula and attack Ivangorod and Warsaw.79 Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided that the main effort in the advance against Warsaw would be entrusted to Mackensen. Aside from his own XVII Corps, Mackensen was given control of the ad hoc Corps Frommel, consisting of the 8th Cavalry Division, 18th Landwehr Division, and the 35th Reserve Division. Mackensen also got at least one brigade of the XX Corps.80 While the Germans moved against Warsaw, Conrad’s armies also went back over to the offensive, although not nearly as a quickly as the Germans preferred. While the Austro-Hungarian First Army tied in with the German Ninth Army’s flank at Opatow, on October 5, 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Third, Fourth, and Second Armies crossed the Wisloka River. As the deteriorating weather turned the roads into bottomless ruts of mud, the AustroHungarians struggled toward the San. Faced with an Austro-Hungarian advance, Brusilov launched one final effort to storm Przemy´sl, but the attack lacked time and heavy artillery and the assaults were beaten off by the garrison. On October 9, 1914, Przemy´sl was reached, much to Conrad’s relief, although the Russians were not fully driven away from the fortress until October 12, 1914. With that, the Austro-Hungarian advance came to a halt.81 Meanwhile, the Russians had not been idle. To begin, the Russians needed to make decisions about commanders. The most notable Russian casualty from Tannenberg was Samsonov, who shot himself on August 30, 1914. The other was Zhilinski. Given a relatively free hand by Grand Duke Nikolai and Stavka in directing the armies of the northwest front, and with Samsonov dead, Zhilinski was left to bear the greatest responsibility for the disaster. The Grand Duke relieved Zhilinski on September 16, 1914. The new commander of the northwest front was Nikolai Ruzski, who had cautiously, if competently, commanded the 3rd Army. The damage to Russian morale by the defeat at Tannenberg and the changes of commanders was offset somewhat by the victories in Galicia and the seizure of Lemberg.82 Changes of commanders and plans continued as the action shifted from East Prussia to the south. To extend Rennenkampf’s line along the Nieman,\n\n15\n\n16\n\nTurning Points\n\na new 10th Army was created, commanded by Vasily Pflug. The recreated 2nd Army, rebuilding around Warsaw, was entrusted to Sergei Scheidemann. As Ruzski was moving up to command the northwest front, command of the 3rd Army was given to the Bulgarian Russophile general Radko Radko-Dmitriev.83 With the German Ninth Army advancing toward Warsaw and the AustroHungarians moving back toward the San, Grand Duke Nikolai saw an opportunity. Under French pressure to undertake an operation against the Germans and recognizing that the German Ninth Army’s left flank was vulnerable, the Grand Duke directed Ivanov to shift three of his armies to the northwest. This turned out to be the 9th, 4th, and 5th Armies. The 5th Army, commanded by General Pavel Plehve, together with the reconstituted 2nd Army, which had been shifted from Ruzski’s northwest front to Ivanov’s southwest front, would strike the left flank of the German Ninth Army. Hindenburg thought the Grand Duke’s plan a very good one.84 The Russian effort, however, enjoyed mixed success at best. The Grand Duke’s intentions were undone by his own doing and by mischance. The execution of the Grand Duke’s plan depended on the smooth cooperation between Ruzski, now commanding the northwest front, and Ivanov, the commander of the southwest front. Too often, however, the front commanders worked at cross-purposes, and the Grand Duke was either unwilling or unable to impose his will on them. In addition, the poor weather made shifting the 5th Army up to Warsaw time-consuming. Finally, German aerial reconnaissance detected signs of the Russian buildup, reporting it to Hindenburg and Mackensen. This intelligence was confirmed by the good fortune of a document capture.85 By the time Ivanov issued the order for the offensive on October 9, the German Ninth Army had reached the end of its logistical tether. The region had very little left to offer in terms of supply. Count Harry Kessler, a high born aesthete, literary critic, and bon vivant serving at Ninth Army headquarters, noted the barren condition of the area. In addition, both the Ninth Army and the Austro-Hungarian First Army lacked the heavy artillery needed to tackle the fortifications at Warsaw and Ivangorod. Relatively forewarned, Mackensen and Hindenburg were able to manage the retreat adeptly, although the Russian attack did cause Mackensen some bad moments. The Ninth Army retreated southwest, toward the Pilica River and the AustroHungarian border, scorching the earth as they went in order to slow any Russian pursuit. The Austro-Hungarian First Army fell back from Ivangorod toward Opatow and then beyond.86 Their drive on Warsaw stymied, the Germans made two important changes. The first involved the command structure. On November 1, 1914, Hindenburg was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and then named commander of all German forces on the eastern front, from then on known as\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nOberbefehlshaber Ost, or Ober Ost. Hindenburg recommended that command of the Ninth Army go to Mackensen, to which OHL agreed.87 Considering the almost-constant acrimony that ensued between Falkenhayn’s OHL and Ober Ost, it is worthwhile to briefly digress into the who and the why of Ober Ost’s creation. Although the order that announced the creation of Ober Ost was published in the kaiser’s name, it is extremely unlikely that he had much, if anything, to do with this move. After all, Wilhelm II had already promised that he would not interfere in the day-to-day conduct of military affairs.88 Much more likely, and to some degree ironically, the creation of Ober was probably the inadvertent doing of Falkenhayn. Once the decision had been taken to create additional army-level headquarters, first the Ninth and then the Tenth, as additional forces were shifted from the west to the east, a higher headquarters was required to provide coordination. Falkenhayn’s OHL staff was too small to be able to direct matters in both the east and the west at the same time. In addition, matters in the west often demanded Falkenhayn’s full attention. Thus, the easiest solution was to set up an overall headquarters in the east. The senior officer and soonto-be Generalfeldmarschall, Hindenburg was the logical choice for the position. Once established, OHL essentially left Ober Ost to its own devices.89 With command matters settled, the focus of German operations shifted back to the northwest. The German Ninth Army, with Mackensen now in command, moved by rail to the area between the minor fortresses of Posen and Thorn. The objective for the new offensive was Lodz. Located about sixty miles from the German border, Lodz was the center of the textile industry in Russian Poland and an important road and rail hub. Possession of the area would provide good quarters for the rapidly approaching harsh winter. Finally, Lodz could provide the base from which a future offensive against Warsaw could be launched.90 Mackensen’s thrust would be complemented by an attack by General der Kavallerie Edouard von Böhm-Ermolli’s AustroHungarian Second Army and the Archduke Josef Ferdinand’s AustroHungarian Fourth Army from the Cracow area. The sector between the Germans and Austro-Hungarians would be covered by the Army Detachment commanded by General der Infanterie Remus von Woyrsch.91 Mackensen’s offensive began on November 11, 1914. Over the next month, Mackensen’s force engaged major elements of Ruzski’s northwest front in what amounted to a duel, each side parrying the blows of the other and then launching counterthrusts. The most dangerous situation for Mackensen was when Russian counterattacks resulted in the encirclement of the General der Infanterie Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel’s German XXV Reserve Corps, a predicament that earned Mackensen some harsh criticism from Hoffmann in his diary.92 Although Stavka anticipated a major success that manifest in the destruction of the XXV Reserve Corps, the Germans evaded annihilation. Scheffer\n\n17\n\n18\n\nTurning Points\n\nkept his head, ordering a retreat toward the road junction of Brzeziny, which he reported by radio. Informed of the situation, Mackensen reacted swiftly, directing the XX Corps toward Brzeziny. Orders were sent by aircraft to Generalleutnant Curt von Morgen, instructing him as well to send forces of his I Reserve Corps to Brzeziny. Finally, a successful conclusion to the XXV Reserve Corps encirclement depended on close cooperation between Plehve’s 5th Army and Scheidemann’s 2nd Army. However, direct communication between the two commanders was poor, and proper coordination by Ruzski’s northwest front was also lacking.93 The upshot of all this was that Scheffer’s force, numbering about 60,000 men, escaped. To add insult to injury, the XXV Reserve Corps also brought out some 10,000 prisoners and a number of captured guns, along with more than 3,000 wounded. Nonetheless, Mackensen’s initial thrust against Lodz had been thwarted. The I Reserve Corps alone had suffered about 8,000 casualties in November.94 The German Ninth Army fell back to the Bzura River. Bolstered by reinforcements from the west, most notably the II Corps and the III Reserve Corps, Mackensen was able to restart the attack, despite the rapidly deteriorating weather (temperatures in late November had dropped to below 10 degrees Fahrenheit) and a shortage of artillery ammunition. During the first week of December, the Germans were able to get to a position that threatened the Russian forces in Lodz with encirclement. Stavka thus ordered the abandonment of Lodz, which was occupied by elements of the German XVII Corps, on December 6, 1914. Although Lodz was now in German hands, the true goal of the operation in Ludendorff’s mind, the encirclement of the Russian forces defending Lodz, had not been achieved.95 While the forces under Ober Ost and the Russian northwest front dueled for the control of westernmost part of Russian Poland, the Russian southwest front was pushing Austria-Hungary into a major crisis. The German failures at Warsaw and Ivangorod in October made it difficult for the AustroHungarian forces to hold the line of the San River. The Austro-Hungarians began to fall back. Recognizing this, the Russian southwest front armies began to retake the initiative. On November 5, 1914, Ivanov ordered an offensive and designated the 11th Army to besiege Przemy´sl.96 Over the course of November, the Austro-Hungarian Second and Third Armies fell back from the San, cautiously pursued by the Russians. The Russians were also pressing the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army, threatening Cracow from the east. Conrad directed the commandant of Przemy´sl, Feldmarschallleutnant Hermann Kusmanek von Burgneustädten, to prepare for another siege. Similar instructions were given to the garrison of Cracow, also a fortress. Conrad also moved the location of AOK from Neu Sandec to Teschen, where it would remain.97 By the end of November, Austria-Hungary’s situation on the eastern front was critical. The Fourth Army’s retreat to cover Cracow had opened a wide\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\ngap between it and the Third Army, which had been driven back toward the Carpathian passes by Brusilov’s 8th Army. The rapidly changing situation in Poland and Galicia also presented Stavka with a new set of choices. On November 29, 1914, Grand Duke Nikolai met his front commanders at Siedlce, the location of northwest front headquarters. Despite trained reserves running short, Danilov, as Stavka’s chief operations officer and ardent hater of all things German, called for yet another offensive against East Prussia. This was rejected by the Grand Duke, as well as the two front commanders. Ivanov, however, suggested that given the state of the Austro-Hungarian forces, an attack by the southwest front would have a better prospect of success. As Ivanov put it to the Grand Duke, “the way to Berlin lies through Austria-Hungary.”98 The Grand Duke, as per his previous conduct, failed to render a clear decision. Although he rejected Danilov’s proposal for a renewed attack against Germany and authorized a retreat by the northwest front, Nikolai Nikolaevich continued to waffle about what the southwest front should do next. Thus, Ivanov’s offensive continued, almost by inertia.99 While the Russian high command struggled to reach a clear consensus, the Central Powers were trying to do the same, while dealing with the difficulties associated with coalition warfare. These difficulties started with the rather fraught relationship between Conrad and Falkenhayn. Since Conrad had not been informed of Moltke’s dismissal, Falkenhayn’s appointment was something of a surprise. Conrad made certain that the relationship with Falkenhayn got off to a bad start. Invited to Berlin for a conference slated for October 28, 1914, Conrad decided not to attend. Instead, Conrad sent his adjutant, Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf Kundmann, to stand in for him. Falkenhayn understandably took this as a snub.100 The first face-to-face meeting between Conrad and Falkenhayn took place on December 2, 1914, at Breslau, Germany. The other participants involved were Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Archduke Friedrich, and Wilhelm II. Hindenburg, Ludendorff, and Falkenhayn engaged in the main discussions. For the Austro-Hungarians, the meeting descended to a “mere formality,” while the kaiser indulged his penchant for making ridiculous statements. The only tangible outcome was that the Germans and Austro-Hungarians continue their offensive efforts.101 The plans for both sides yielded, at best, mixed results. The decision to have the northwest front retreat to a more defensible position east of Lodz along the Bzura and Rawka Rivers allowed the Russians to blunt any further German advance by Mackensen’s Ninth Army. Attacks over the second and third weeks of December produced little more than casualties. Thus Mackensen, with his troops exhausted and winter closing its grip, went over to the defensive. To the northeast, the German and Russian forces held the positions reached at the end of the Masurian Lakes operation, with the Russians\n\n19\n\n20\n\nTurning Points\n\nstill ensconced in a sliver of East Prussian territory. South of the Ninth Army’s sector, Böhm-Ermolli’s Austro-Hungarian Second Army, which included some German units, made some short advances in the area south of Lodz, but these efforts also ran out of steam.102 Conrad’s efforts to halt the Russian advance were successful, but at a cost. Using the roads and rail lines around Cracow, Conrad put the AustroHungarian Fourth Army, now commanded by Archduke Joseph, in a very advantageous position. Attacking the flank of Radko’s Russian 3rd Army, the archduke’s forces, bolstered also by the German 47th Reserve Division, drove the Russians back some forty miles, eliminating the threat to Cracow. Farther to the southeast, the Russian 8th and 9th Armies drove deep into the Carpathian passes before the advance was halted by stiffening AustroHungarian resistance and deteriorating conditions. Przemy´sl, with its garrison of 130,000 troops, 30,000 remaining civilian inhabitants, and 21,500 horses, would have to withstand what was clearly understood to be potentially a much-longer siege.103 It was now apparent that the war was going to extend into 1915, and both sides sought to organize their respective rear areas. For the Germans, this meant expanding the network of depots near the East Prussian frontier. For example, the war minister ordered Lötzen to be expanded as a depot. The officer responsible for undertaking the task was the deputy corps commander of the XX Corps, the local unit based in the area.104 The expansion of logistical facilities was essential as the size of German forces in the east increased over the course of 1914, and it also allowed the Germans to correct serious errors that had been made, particularly in logistics. The most egregious mistake concerned the mismanagement of equine resources. At the outset of the war, the German army had made no provision for the care of lightly wounded or exhausted horses. This resulted in the needless loss of numerous horses. Meanwhile, the German military sought to expand its industrial output in order to cope with the demands of modern industrialized war waged on a vast scale. Thanks to the capabilities of Walter Rathenau, Germany was able to do that.105 The Austro-Hungarians also had to reorganize their rear area. The army had to be replenished with men and almost wholly reequipped. The nature of the empire presented continued problems for the mobilization and training of millions of soldiers. Replenishing equipment, however, proved to be a more tractable matter, owing to the activity of the Austrian war minister, Alexander Krobatin.106 In addition to feeding the population under wartime conditions, the Austro-Hungarian government also had one more problem to cope with: large numbers of refugees. Germany also had to deal with refugees created by the Russian invasion of East Prussia. Fortunately for the Germans, operations in East Prussia were of a relatively brief duration. Schneidemühl, a\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nsmall city in East Prussia on the Berlin-Bromberg rail line, for example, had to deal with trainloads of refugees from border towns over the course of late August and early September 1914. By November, however, the situation had changed to the extent that the German army was able to establish a prisoner of war camp at Schneidemühl. The refugees were able to return to their homes, or rather what was left of them.107 The Austro-Hungarian situation was far grimmer. A large chunk of Galicia had been lost, including major cities such as Lemberg. Even before the first siege, a large portion of Przemy´sl’s civilian population had been evacuated. A further 8,000 people left in the interval before the second siege began. A large number of civilians also fled Cracow as the Russians approached. Thus, by the late autumn of 1914, the Austro-Hungarian government had to deal with caring for hundreds of thousands of refugees.108 The Russians had similar problems in adjusting to the needs of what now looked to be a prolonged war. Like its German and Austro-Hungarian opponents, the Russian government sought to expand its production of arms and munitions as rapidly as possible, while also replenishing its man power. In the area near the front line, the Russian army had two similar-but-different tasks to undertake. The first was to take over the civil administration of Russian territory near the front. This applied particularly to Poland, where the army had to take control of the maintenance of law and order, as well as the gathering of supplies and food.109 The second major task for the Russian army was to organize and maintain a government of occupation for the conquered territory. Of the three combatants, only Russia had been able to occupy a large swath of enemy territory that it now had to administer. This turned out to be a source of conflict between Stavka and the government, owing to unclear demarcation of authority. The first military governor of Galicia, Colonel Sergei Sheremetiev, pursued a pro-Polish policy, based on the proclamation issued by Grand Duke Nikolai to the Polish inhabitants of Austria-Hungary. Such a pro-Polish line, however, soon ran afoul of the local pro-Russian elements, as well as Russian nationalist politicians in the Russian Duma.110 The Grand Duke then appointed Count Georgi Alexandrovich Bobrinski as governor general of Galicia. Bobrinski was a large landowner who had made his fortune in sugar. His cousin Vladimir was a major figure in the Duma and an ardent Russian nationalist. As the new governor general, Bobrinski instituted price controls, ostensibly to contain inflation. He would also introduce cultural and religious steps to Russify the area, which would bring him into conflict with Stavka, especially Grand Duke Nikolai’s chief of staff, General Nikolai N. Yanushkevich.111 All of the combatants entered the war with carefully designed war plans. All of them miscarried. The same fate befell the follow-on plans formulated by the respective belligerents. These failures were accompanied by losses\n\n21\n\n22\n\nTurning Points\n\nthat could be described only as immense. Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes alone, for example, cost the Russian 1st and 2nd Armies some 250,000 casualties.112 Losses incurred in the campaigns in Galicia and Poland were also considerable. Thwarting the German attack on Warsaw alone, for example, cost the Russian 2nd, 4th, and 9th Armies probably over 150,000 casualties. Fighting in Galicia, while more successful, cost the southwest front another 230,000 casualties, just in August and September alone. Taken all together, Russian casualties likely came close to 1,000,000.113 These losses were difficult to replace. Although the Russians had over 3,000,000 men in some type of reserve status at the start of the war, the number was very deceptive. Of all these reservists, only a very small number, perhaps about 200,000, were fully trained, and these men were used up very quickly. By October 1914, commanders such as Brusilov were concerned about the inadequate training of reservists and draftees used as replacements. Losses in officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs) were also difficult to replace.114 Changes extended to the upper ranks of the Russian army as well. Zhilinski, relieved in the aftermath of the Tannenberg disaster, was packed off to France as Stavka’s representative to French headquarters. Zhilinski’s tenure as a military diplomat proved to be about as successful as his tour as commander of the northwest front. After making himself thoroughly unwelcome at French headquarters, in 1916 Zhiliniski was recalled at the insistence of French commander-in-chief Marshal Joseph Joffre.115 At the army level, changes of command were rather more frequent, especially in the northwest front. Rennenkampf evaded any culpability for Tannenberg. Although Rennenkampf’s 1st Army was able to outrun the German Eighth Army in its retreat toward the border in the Masurian Lakes operation, his plainly pessimistic attitude did not impress his superiors. A lackluster performance in the initial stages of the Lodz campaign proved the final straw; the Grand Duke relieved Rennenkampf, turning the 1st Army over to Alexander Litvinov. Scheidemann’s leadership of the 2nd Army was also found wanting. He was removed in favor of Vladimir Smirnov.116 Vasili Pflug, commander of the 10th Army, ran afoul of Ruzski when Pflug exceeded his orders in a minor Russian operation on the Nieman River in late September, launching an ill-considered night attack attended with heavy casualties. Ruzski dismissed Pflug and replaced him with an aged-but-experienced staff officer, Faddei Sievers.117 While the relief of Rennenkampf, Scheidemann, and Pflug could certainly be justified on the basis of unsatisfactory performance, many in Russia saw an ethnic aspect to the Grand Duke’s actions. Anti-German sentiment had been on the rise in Russia for some time, and the outbreak of war only exacerbated such feeling.118 The removal of these commanders was regarded by many as an effort by Nikolai Nikolaevich to purge Germans from the upper\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\nechelons of the Russian army. This was fraught with some difficulty for the Grand Duke, especially in the case of Rennenkampf, who was well connected to the court. Although the Grand Duke prevailed in this matter, it served only to deepen the mutual dislike between Nikolai Nikolaevich and Tsarina Alexandra.119 The German army had enjoyed the most success, but in World War I, victory rarely, if ever, came cheap. Tannenberg was relatively inexpensive, as one can estimate German casualties to be around 20,000, including losses suffered at Gumbinnen.120 Success and failure became more dearly bought as time went on. Casualties in the Lodz campaign and its aftermath, for example, were over 100,000.121 Despite the losses, the German army had scored several critical successes, most notably Tannenberg at the start of the war and Lodz near the end of the year. From a broader operational perspective, Germany’s key advantage was its road and rail system. Perhaps the most important factor that made Tannenberg what it was, as Gerhard Gross has argued, was that Tannenberg was defensive battle fought on German soil.122 The ability to mount the Lodz campaign so quickly after the conclusion of the failed Warsaw operation was a tribute to the German rail system. In operations close to German territory, the German rail and road system gave the German army a degree of nimbleness unmatched by either friend or foe on the eastern front.123 Another key factor in the German army’s performance in the campaigns of 1914 was its overall quality. The German army could rely on a pool of relatively well-educated men. While the vast majority of soldiers did not take the arbitur, they did have enough education to allow them to ascend, if successful, into the noncommissioned officer corps, a critical component of the army. Reserve units in the German army were maintained at a fairly high standard and were well led. Reserve officers were usually well educated, and reserve commissions were valued by those who held them. Thus, once mobilized, while German reserve units had the usual problems adapting to active service, they were able to catch up quickly. Even the Landwehr Corps, composed of older men and given a relatively limited mission, was able to get up speed in a short time.124 Command was another edge for the Germans. To be sure, not every German commander was a Frederick or Moltke the Elder in waiting. Prittwitz’s initial conduct as commander of the Eighth Army was wobbly enough for the younger Moltke to relieve both Prittwitz and his chief of staff, Georg Waldersee. François, who was insubordinate but lucky in the Tannenberg campaign, found Hindenburg a far less patient superior than Prittwitz. After one insubordinate act too many, François was dismissed by Hindenburg.125 Such incidents as those of Prittwitz and François, however, were few and far between. German commanders performed well, especially in critical situations, exemplified by Scheffer’s handling of the XXV Reserve Corps while\n\n23\n\n24\n\nTurning Points\n\nsurrounded by the Russians. It is also interesting to note how much use the Germans got out of their retired general officers. Hindenburg was the most famous example, but there were others. Woyrsch, who had also retired in 1911, was able to make positive contributions, beginning with his providing support to Dankl’s Austro-Hungarian First Army at Krasnik.126 Of the three belligerents on the eastern front in 1914, the AustroHungarian army was the most impacted. With about two million officers and men, Francis Joseph’s army was the smallest of the major continental powers that went to war in 1914. The army had also been the most poorly funded over time and was often the victim of the nature of the dual monarchy’s political structure.127 The lack of funding left the army short of weapons, especially artillery, and other equipment. Thus, in the estimation of the German liaison officer at AOK, August von Cramon, the Austro-Hungarian army was capable of only dealing with Serbia. Coping with the Russian army, that could field as many as six million men once fully mobilized, was beyond the capability of the Austro-Hungarian army.128 In the actual event, AustriaHungary got the worst of all possible worlds, having to fight Russia and Serbia at the same time. Given its size at the start, it is not surprising to note that the AustroHungarian army was the most severely impacted by the losses suffered in the 1914 campaigns. Between defeats in Serbia and Galicia, the Austro-Hungarian Army suffered about 957,000 casualties, including 189,000 killed, 490,000 wounded, and 278,000 taken prisoner. Officer casualties came to some 22,310, including 3,168 killed. Over 1,000 guns had been lost, of which only about one-third had been replaced. Losses in horses had also been enormous, around 150,000.129 The loss of so many officers (about half of the prewar officer corps) was serious as, given the polyglot nature of the army, the replacements did not have the linguistic capabilities needed to deal with the soldiers beyond the eighty words in German, the language of command. The Austro-Hungarians did their best to maintain existing units rather than create new ones. The magnitude of the losses, however, made sure that very few surviving veterans were around to transmit the hard lessons of combat experience to the under trained newcomers.130 The Austro-Hungarian army was particularly hard hit in the realm of command. Some general officers broke down mentally under the strain of combat and heavy casualties. Deeply affected by the casualties inflicted on his 15th Infantry Division at Komarów, Feldmarschallleutnant Friedrich Wodniansky von Wildenfeld shot himself on August 27, 1914. Wodniansky was not the only Austro-Hungarian general officer to do so.131 A more common fate for Austro-Hungarian generals was relief from command. The numbers alone were staggering. By the end of 1914, four of the six original army commanders had been relieved. Of the seventeen corps\n\nBest Laid Plans and Their Miscarriage: The 1914 Campaigns in the East\n\ncommanders, six had been relieved, along with ten division commanders and twenty-four brigade commanders. The basis for these reliefs varied, ranging from attempts to shift blame for defeats to unsatisfactory performance. To be sure, there were some bright spots, such the performances of Dankl and Svetozar Boroevic´ at army-level command, while Feldmarschallleutnant Artur Arz von Straussenberg and General der Infanterie Hermann Kövess von Kövessháza had distinguished themselves as corps commanders.132 By the end of 1914, the three combatants on the eastern front were in situations that bore some similarities but also some critical differences. All three countries had executed their war plans, and all three had failed, with heavy casualties. Some failures, however, were worse than others. Clearly the worst failure was that of Austria-Hungary, which was now teetering on the edge of catastrophe. While Russia had driven Austria-Hungary to the edge of defeat, it had suffered several demoralizing setbacks at the hands of the Germans. As for Germany, the war in the east had produced some impressive successes, most notably at Tannenberg and later at Lodz. These were offset, however, by the failure before Warsaw and by the need to provide aid to the hard-pressed Austro-Hungarian forces. In any case, both sides started 1915 in quest of a plan that would bring victory in the east.\n\n25\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nStrategists, Strategy, Operations, and Coalition Warfare\n\nIn my view, the four new corps, that should be ready in January, must be committed to the east to clear up the situation there, and then we can attack in the west with a superior force. —Generaloberst Hans von Plessen, December 31, 19141 I was able on this occasion to become with the ideas of Conrad. He is an educated officer, but no great man. —Erich Ludendorff, January 2, 19152 The proposals of the Austrian G.H.Q. were agreed to. —Erich von Falkenhayn3 With the plans of both sides now essentially in tatters, it was high time for the leaders of the respective sides to reconsider their strategy. This process revolved around two facets: the individual personalities involved and the institutions of which they were a part. A brief survey of these factors is now in order. For this study, from the standpoint of January 1915, the three people who arguably mattered the least were the respective heads of state. The kaiser’s promise to stay out of day-to-day matters has already been noted. Theoretically, Tsar Nicholas II was supposed to assume the mantle of commander-in-chief.\n\n28\n\nTurning Points\n\nPressure from his ministers, however, led the tsar to remain in Petrograd and to appoint his cousin, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, as the head of Stavka. As for the Austro-Hungarians, Francis Joseph was simply too old.4 The effective removal of the three monarchs from the making of strategy left these matters in the hands of their respective heads of their militaries. For the Russians, this was the cousin of Nicholas II, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. Born on November 18, 1856, the Grand Duke was destined to be a cavalryman from birth, given that his uncle Alexander II had the Grand Duke enrolled in the Guards Life Hussar Regiment while he was still in the crib.5 After receiving a well-rounded education, aided with the benefit of foreign travel, Nikolai Nikolaevich entered the army in 1873. Attending the Nikolaevski General Staff Academy, the Grand Duke graduated in April 1876 with the rank of captain. Almost immediately thereafter Nikolai Nikolaevich went to war. His father, Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich senior, was the commander of Russian forces going to war against Ottoman Turkey in support of Bulgaria’s independence. Nikolai Nikolaevich junior saw the Russo-Turkish War at the highest and lowest levels, taking part in the crossing of the Danube in June 1877, while also spending a good deal of time at his father’s headquarters.6 After the conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War, the Grand Duke enjoyed a successful career in the cavalry, although Nicholas II’s refusal to permit Nikolai Nikolaevich to enter into a morganatic marriage nearly resulted in his resignation. Ultimately, however, Nikolai Nikolaevich took command of the 2nd Cavalry Division after an extended leave. After a successful tour as a commander, the tsar appointed Nikolai Nikolaevich the inspector general of cavalry in 1895. In that position, the Grand Duke did a great deal to reform the Russian army’s cavalry branch, earning plaudits even from his critics.7 A marriage to Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna, daughter of Prince Nicola of Montenegro, although a source of personal joy to the Grand Duke, met with the disapproval of both Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra. Appointed to head the Council of State Defense in 1907, the Grand Duke sought to bring about reforms to the Russian army, desperately needed after the disastrous defeats in the Russo-Japanese War. Ultimately, his efforts in this regard foundered after the Grand Duke lost a bureaucratic battle over the issue of the independence of the General Staff from the War Ministry. Nikolai Nikolaevich’s principal opponent, General Vladimir Sukhomlinov, gained control over both organizations in December 1908 and eventually succeeded in getting the Council of Ministers to abolish the Council of State Defense.8 Although somewhat diminished in stature, the Grand Duke continued to hold the position of commandant of the Petersburg Military District. The appointment of Nikolai Nikolaevich as commander-in-chief was regarded by many as something of a surprise, but once Nicholas II was convinced not to\n\nStrategists, Strategy, Operations, and Coalition Warfare\n\ntake command personally, it is difficult to see anyone other than the Grand Duke filling the role. Given the nature of the imperial Russian government, the presence of the royal family at Stavka was imperative, and no one else in the royal family enjoyed the military reputation that Nikolai Nikolaevich did.9 Once appointed commander-in-chief by Nicholas II, the Grand Duke quickly arrogated power to himself, effectively freezing out the War Ministry. At one point, Sukhomlinov’s name was dropped from the list of persons allowed to visit Stavka, and Sukhomlinov had to go to the tsar to have the omission corrected.10 Given that the Grand Duke was accountable only to the tsar and that Nicholas II was not inclined to take an active role, the making of strategy in early 1915 rested with the Grand Duke and a small group of officers. While the appointment of the Grand Duke was met with wide support in the army, it did have its downside. After his resignation from the State Defense Council, Nikolai Nikolaevich had been largely removed from planning. Thus the Grand Duke would need some time to get up to speed. Nikolai Nikolaevich also asked for appointment of Generals Fedor F. Palitsyn and Mikhail V. Alekseev as chief of staff and quartermaster general, respectively, a request the tsar rejected. For the sake of continuity, the Grand Duke would have to rely on the officers then filling those slots, Generals Nikolai N. Yanushkevich and Yuri N. Danilov. This troika would be responsible for directing Russia’s war against Germany and Austria-Hungary.11 Of the two junior members of the troika, Yanushkevich was perhaps the oddest choice for the position he held. Yanushkevich was rather young (fortysix years of age) and had not seen any real field service, having spent most of his career working in the War Ministry or at the General Staff Academy. Although he was intelligent, nothing in his background or career indicated that he was possessed of exceptional skill or insight. Yanushkevich had the ability to span the bridge between the two major factions of the Russian high command. Yanushkevich was Sukhomlinov’s choice to be chief of the general staff, but he had also enjoyed the patronage of both the tsar and the Grand Duke earlier in his career. Alfred Knox, the British officer at Stavka, described Yanushkevich as being more courtier than soldier.12 Yanushkevich was influential, in that he was Stavka’s gatekeeper, thus determining who would get access to the Grand Duke. He also served as the conduit between Stavka and the War Ministry. More influential in regard to operations was Yuri Danilov, the quartermaster general. His career in the army was much broader than that of Yanushkevich and encompassed a combination of staff and line assignments, including a tour as commander of the 166th Infantry Regiment. Assigned to the General Staff in 1908, he became something of a protégé of Sukhomlinov and was critical to the development of the Russian mobilization plans of 1914. Knox considered Danilov to be the best mind in Stavka. While many Russian officers would be critical of\n\n29\n\n30\n\nTurning Points\n\nDanilov’s ideas, Knox noted that “no one ever suggested the name of an officer who could have done better.”13 The location of Stavka is also worthy of comment. Throughout 1914 and 1915, Stavka was housed in two trains and one building at a railway siding in a pine forest near Baranovici, a small city of perhaps as many as 30,000 people. The city’s population had a substantial Jewish segment, thus making Stavka’s location ironic, given that both the Grand Duke and Yanushkevich were virulently anti-Semitic.14 Baranovici was a suitable location, in that it was the junction of three rail lines, thus giving the Grand Duke easy access by rail to his principal subordinate commanders. On the other hand, it was relatively isolated, with neither a telephone exchange nor a wireless radio station. The only long-distance means of communication was a single Hughes teletype machine. Thus, the flow of information into and out of Stavka was slow, and in a fast-moving situation, matters could and did at times escape from Stavka’s grasp. Finally, it must be noted that the size of Stavka itself was very small, perhaps about sixty personnel in all. The veritable nerve center of Stavka, Danilov’s offices, which encompassed the"
