Department of National Defence/Library and Archives Canada; (MIKAN no. 3397890)\n\nThe First World War\n\nDate\n\n8-11 August 1918\n\nGeographical parameters\n\nBetween the roads Amiens — Royes and Amiens — Albert (Amiens exclusive)\n\nContext\n\nA group honour formally entitled The Battle of Amiens and itself being part of The Advance in Picardy (8 August — 3 September 1918).Footnote 1\n\nDescription\n\nThe Honour “Amiens” was awarded for the Allied offensive in the Picardy region of France to retake the ground gained by the German Army during the 1918 Spring Offensive. The British divisions in the area had been weakened by the many months of difficult fighting to halt the advance. The Canadian Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir A.W. Currie) had not suffered greatly from the German attacks and was selected along with the Australian Corps to form the British portion of an Anglo-French attack against the apex of the German salient east of Amiens. General Currie was made aware of the plan for his Corps as early as 20 July but planning for the attack was to be done under utmost secrecy. Canadian troops did not start moving to the area until after 1 August and only moved at night. To deceive the Germans, Canadian preparations for an attack in the Arras area continued and a few Canadian units and signalers were moved to the Flanders area to give the impression of a Canadian build up in that area. Division commanders were not told of the attack until the 30th of July and Canadian soldiers who began the move thought they were going to the Ypres front until they loaded onto vehicles in the rear areas and received orders to move toward Amiens. The logistical undertaking was enormous but in a short period most of the Canadian Corps' soldiers, equipment, guns and huge stocks of ammunition were in place for the attack. The left-hand Canadian Corps boundary, with the Australians, was along the railway line between Amiens and Chaulnes. On the Canadian right was the French 31st Corps to the south of the Amiens Roye road."
