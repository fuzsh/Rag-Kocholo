Garde-Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the German Army, in World War I. The division was formed on the mobilization of the German Army in August 1914[1] as part of the Guards Reserve Corps. The division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. It was a division of the Prussian Guards and was thus raised and recruited throughout the Kingdom of Prussia from the elite of recruits.\n\nCombat chronicle\n\nThe 3rd Guards Infantry Division began the war on the Western Front, participating in the capture of Namur. It was transferred to the Eastern Front in September 1914, and saw action on arrival in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. It then fought in the Battle of Łódź. It continued fighting in the Carpathians and Galicia and then participated in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. The division returned to the Western Front in April 1916 and entered the trenches in the Champagne region. In July 1916, it fought in the Battle of the Somme. At the beginning of September 1916, the division was again sent to the Eastern Front, returning in November. In 1917, it participated in the Battle of Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele. It then fought against the Allied tank attack in November 1917 in the Battle of Cambrai. In 1918, it fought in the German spring offensive. During the subsequent Allied offensives and counteroffensives, the division faced the French and Americans at Aisne-Marne and in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The division was rated as one of the best German divisions by Allied intelligence.[2][3]\n\nOrder of battle on mobilization\n\nThe order of battle of the 3rd Guards Infantry Division on mobilization was as follows:[4]\n\n5th Guards Infantry Brigade\n\n5th Guard Regiment of Foot\n\n5th Guard Grenadier Regiment\n\n6th Guards Infantry Brigade (German Empire)|6th Guards Infantry Brigade\n\nGuard Fusilier Regiment\n\nLehr Infantry Regiment\n\n3rd Guard Field Artillery Brigade (German Empire)|3rd Guard Field Artillery Brigade\n\n5th Guard Field Artillery Regiment\n\n6th Guard Field Artillery Regiment\n\nGuards Reserve Uhlan Regiment\n\n1st Company/28th (2nd Brandenburg) Pioneer-Battalion\n\nOrder of battle on July 1, 1916\n\nThe 3rd Guards Infantry Division was triangularized in May 1915.
