        "text": "Erich von Manstein (born Nov. 24, 1887, Berlin, Ger.—died June 11, 1973, Irschenhausen, near Munich, W.Ger.) was perhaps the most talented German field commander in World War II.\n\nThe son of an artillery general, he was adopted by General Georg von Manstein after the untimely death of his parents. Manstein began his active career as an officer in 1906 and served in World War I on both the Western and Russian fronts. Rising through the ranks, he was promoted to major general in 1936 and to lieutenant general in 1938. At the start of World War II, he served as chief of staff to General Gerd von Rundstedt in the invasion of Poland (1939). Manstein had in the meantime devised a daring plan to invade France by means of a concentrated armoured thrust through the Ardennes Forest. Though this plan was rejected by the German High Command, Manstein managed to bring it to the personal attention of Adolf Hitler, who enthusiastically adopted it.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nAfter leading an infantry corps in the assault on France in June 1940, Manstein was promoted to general that month. He commanded the 56th Panzer Corps in the invasion of the Soviet Union (1941), and nearly captured Leningrad. Promoted to command of the 11th Army on the southern front (September 1941), Manstein managed to take 430,000 Soviet prisoners, after which he withstood the Soviet counteroffensive that winter and went on to capture Sevastopol in July 1942. Soon after, he was promoted to field marshal. He almost succeeded in relieving the beleaguered 6th Army in Stalingrad in December 1942–January 1943, and in February 1943 his forces recaptured Kharkov, in the most successful German counteroffensive of the war. Thereafter he was driven into retreat, and in March 1944 he was dismissed by Hitler."
