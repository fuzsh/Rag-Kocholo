        "text": "In Galicia a combined Austro-Hungarian and German force is attacking the Russians at Przemysl. After taking some of the outlying forts, the Austro-Hungarians now push into the town itself. The Russians still hold forts on the right bank of the river, but with the town back in Austro-Hungarian hands it will not be long before they fall.\n\nThe Russians were only able to capture Przemysl after a siege of four months. How has it been recaptured so quickly? The heavy artillery of the Austro-Hungarians is like nothing the Russians have themselves. It has been able to pummel the Russians into submission or else obliterate them. Also, the Gorlice-Tarnów offensive has the Russians in retreat everywhere; they are not committing major forces to the defence of Przemysl lest they be cut off by the enemy’s advance. So the Austro-Hungarians win back their city relatively easily, but by riding the Germans’ coat-tails.\n\nimage source:\n\nGerman and Austro-Hungarian troops at Przemysl, with Russian prisoners (Visit Przemysl; with photographs of the fortifications as they are now)\n\nSee also: The History of the Construction of the Fortress of Przemyśl by Tom Idzikowski, from the website Austro-Hungarian Land Forces 1848-1918.\n\nThe Galician fortified town of Przemysl fell to the Russians after a long siege back in March. The Russians have not had long to celebrate their triumph. With the Gorlice-Tarnów offensive seeing the Russians pushed back everywhere, the Austro-Hungarians are now back in the vicinity of Przemysl, advancing from the south-west. And this time they have brought their German friends with them.\n\nAn attack to take the town’s outlying fortresses by sudden assault failed. Since then the Austro-Hungarians have battered the defenders with their heavy 420mm siege guns. Now the infantry assault begins again, with the Austro-Hungarians and Germans methodically advancing to capture the enemy’s positions one by one. Przemysl will not fall overnight, but its capture looks increasingly inevitable.\n\nimage source (Visit Przemysl, with pictures of the fortifications today)\n\nThe siege of Van is over. The Turkish besiegers fled from outside the eastern Anatolian town as Russian troops approached. Advance Russian forces arrived a few days ago. Now at last Van sees the arrival of the main Russian force, which has a large contingent of Armenian volunteers. The town is now re-victualled.\n\nAram Manukian, leader of the Armenians in Van, greets the Russians. The Russian force is led by General Andranik (himself an Armenian). He appoints Manukian governor of the city and the surrounding area.\n\nVan province has been blasted by war and ethnic violence. Many of the Armenians outside the town have been killed or driven to flight by the Ottoman authorities. Now the Kurds and Turks suffer a similar fate from the Armenian irregular forces. Within Van the Armenians have already killed or driven away their Muslim neighbours.\n\nimage source:\n\nGeneral Andranik with some of the defenders of Van (Wikipedia)\n\nThe Armenians in Van have been under siege for over a month. The Turks have been unable to storm the eastern Anatolian town but have tried to starve out the Armenian rebels. They have also killed and abused many Armenians living in the countryside around the town.\n\nRussian forces are marching to relieve Van. They are not here yet, but they are getting close. The Turks besieging Van have no desire to be caught by the superior Russian column. So now they slip away from Van under cover of darkness. As day breaks the Armenians realise that the siege is over. Their situation is still desperate, however, as they are short of food and urgently need the supplies the Russian army is bringing to them.\n\nGenerals Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Germany’s commanders on the Eastern Front, have long argued that if they are given the men they can inflict a decisive defeat on Russia, knocking it out of the war. Erich von Falkenhayn, Germany’s supreme military commander, is sceptical. He thinks that victory must first be secured on the Western Front before forces can be concentrated against Russia. Despite changing circumstances he is still wedded to the France-first strategy of Germany’s pre-war plans.\n\nHowever, the run of victories Hindenburg and Ludendorff achieved with the limited forces at their disposal have made their arguments hard to resist. Falkenhayn has given them Germany’s reserves, with which Mackensen, their subordinate, has launched an offensive between Gorlice and Tarnów in Galicia. Mackensen is also commanding large numbers of Austro-Hungarian troops. The hope for the offensive was that the Russian threat to the Hungarian heartland would be eliminated and also that still neutral Bulgaria and Romanian might be encouraged to enter the war on Germany’s side.\n\nThe Gorlice-Tarnów offensive is succeeding beyond the wildest dreams of its planners. The teutonic juggernaut has completely smashed the Russians in front of it, who are now either in headlong flight or else surrendering to the victors. Since the offensive was launched last week, some 100,000 Russian prisoners and 100 artillery pieces have been captured.\n\nAnd today Austro-Hungarian forces cross the San river. Their target is the fortress city of Przemysl, which fell to the Russians in March after a long siege. Its recapture would be a great symbolic victory for the Habsburg Empire.\n\nimage sources:\n\nHindenburg and Ludendorff (Wikipedia)\n\nRussian prisoners (Wikipedia)\n\nThings might not be going so well for the Russians in Galicia, but in the Caucasus Yudenich thinks it is time his men took the war to the Turks. Having already sent forces to raise the siege of Van, he now orders an advance towards Erzurum, further to the north and closer to the Russian border. But Turkish resistance is stronger than expected; Russian progress is slow.\n\nEastern Anatolia (The Great War Blog)\n\nGermany’s Mackensen is commanding a combined Austro-Hungarian and German offensive on the Eastern Front, attacking the Russians in Galicia between Gorlice and Tarnów. On the first day of the offensive the Russian line was shattered. Now the Russians throw an entire corps at the enemy in a counter-attack, desperately hoping to stabilise the line.\n\nThe counter-attack fails. The Russians are thrown back and many of their units start to disintegrate. The Germans and Austro-Hungarians have achieved a breakthrough: they are now advancing through open country.\n\nGerman forces are still attacking at Ypres, but the fighting there is a diversion. Falkenhayn has been persuaded to send Germany’s mobile reserve east. It has been decided to attack the Russians between Gorlice and Tarnów in Galicia. Germany’s Mackensen is to lead the attack, commanding German and Austro-Hungarian armies.\n\nThe attack begins with a devastating artillery bombardment: some 700,000 shells fired in just a few hours. Then the Germans and Austro-Hungarians surge forwards. In some sectors the artillery bombardment has so shaken the Russians that the attackers find them to have already fled. In others they put up more resistance but are thrown by the strength of Mackensen’s assault. Either way the Russian defenders collapse. This is already looking like another striking victory for German arms on the Eastern Front.\n\nimage sources:\n\nAugust von Mackensen (Wikipedia)\n\nGorlice-Tarnów map (from a Polish language website which I think is for First World War cemetaries in Poland)\n\nArmenian rebels in Van remain under siege. Refugees from the countryside are flooding into the city, apparently being allowed through the Turkish lines. Perhaps the Turks want to stretch the demands on Van’s food supplies to the maximum extent. Or perhaps it is also convenient for them to have as many of the Armenians as possible in one place.\n\nThe Armenians in Van are able to repel assaults by the Turks, but they cannot hold out indefinitely. Food shortages will eventually become a problem, but in the immediate term the defenders’ big problem is shortage of ammunition. The defenders are ordered to use ammunition as sparingly as possible.\n\nFortunately help is on its way. Messengers have been sent to the Russians revealing the town’s plight. Van’s pleas do not go unanswered. Today Russia’s General Yudenich orders a force of Cossacks and Armenians to march to the aid of Van.\n\nimage sources:\n\nArmenian refugees in Van (Wikipedia)\n\nDefenders of Van (Wikipedia)\n\nThe Russians overran the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia last year. The Carpathian Mountains stand between them and the heartland of the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Empire. Fighting in these mountains has been see-sawing backwards and forwards. Earlier this year the Austro-Hungarians took control of the mountain passes but were unable to push from them to recapture Galicia.\n\nNow the Russians attack once more in the Carpathians. Perhaps they are buoyed up by their capture of Przemysl, perhaps news of the town’s fall has shaken the Austro-Hungarians, but either way the Russians are able to capture the Lupkow Pass through the Carpathians. Could the way finally be open for them to mount an invasion of Hungary?\n\nimage source (History Net)"
