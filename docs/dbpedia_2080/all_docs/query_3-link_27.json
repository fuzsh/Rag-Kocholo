        "text": "Gas was not a new weapon in 1915 but the Second Battle of Ypres was the first time chlorine gas was used and the first time it was employed on such a scale.\n\nThe first gas attack came on 22 April. It targeted a 4-mile stretch of the Allied line on the north side of the salient, held by French and Algerian troops. The shock of the gas and its effects resulted in a breach of the Allied line.\n\nTwo days later, on 24 April, a second gas attack targeted the 1st Canadian Division. The Canadians launched a determined defence and prevented a German breakthrough. In the weeks that followed, successive attacks and counterattacks by German and Allied forces resulted in further territory lost for the Allies and high casualties on both sides. The Allies were left holding a line just outside Ypres.\n\nBy the end of the battle, the Allies remained in possession of Ypres but the salient was constricted and valuable high ground had been lost. Casualties among British Empire forces numbered in excess of 55,000.\n\nThe Ypres salient saw heavy casualties from German artillery and attacks for the next two years. In July 1917, the Allies launched an offensive to retake the high ground and break out of the salient - the Third Battle of Ypres.\n\nThe advent of the use of gas on the battlefield (the British Army employed gas at the Battle of Loos in September) prompted both sides to begin developing more effective gas protection.\n\nFollowing the gas attack Ypres, Allied forces were initially provided with cotton pads to cover their mouths, soaked in chemicals or sometimes urine, and goggles. Over the course of the war, more effective respirators were developed."
