As part of Maréchal Foch’s General Offensive, the British, French, American and Belgian armies launched four attacks in rapid succession across a 350km front between the Argonne and Flanders. At the centre of this huge assault the British Expeditionary Force’s (BEF) First, Third and Fourth Armies, supported by the French 1re Armée, breached the formidable Hindenburg Line defences between Cambrai and St Quentin. In stark contrast to the bloody stalemates of 1916–17, this success drove the German Army from its last fully prepared defensive position west of the Rhine, shattering the authority of the German Imperial and military establishment. However, while this battle demonstrated the newly found tactical and operational dominance of the Allies, it also exposed the latent strategic tensions between them as they sought the most advantageous positions for the post-war settlement. These factors converged to ensure that, as a result, the Armistice with Germany was imposed in 1918 and on stringent Allied terms. From 1918 onwards, however, the battle of the Hindenburg Line struggled to receive the public recognition it deserved and, unlike the Somme and Passchendaele, soon slipped from the cultural memory of the war. It became Haig’s forgotten triumph. The German Army constructed the Hindenburg Line in response to the unsustainable casualty rates it suffered in 1916 at Verdun and on the Somme. When Hindenburg and Ludendorff replaced Falkenhayn as leaders of the German Supreme Command – Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL) – in early September, they immediately reviewed the Central Powers’ strategy. As a result, the German Army assumed a defensive posture in France and Flanders and the main strategic offensive in the West transferred to the German Navy, which prepared to launch a submarine campaign against Allied shipping in 1917. This strategy required the construction of a state-of-the-art defensive position between Arras and Laon, which shortened the front line by approximately 45km, releasing units to reconstitute the German reserve, and also implemented all the lessons learnt during 1915–16 in how to fight effective defensive battles. The new position provided deep\n\nGerman dead outside a dugout on the Somme in 1916. The German Army suffered around 700,000 casualties here and at Verdun under the crushing weight of Allied artillery fire. This experience was a major factor in the decision to build a defence line that was both difficult for the British and French guns to hit and protected the garrison from blast and shrapnel when in their fighting positions. (IWM, Q4256)\n\n5\n\nThe Hindenburg Line at Inchyen-Artois. The belts of barbed wire and the parallel trench lines running across the centre of photograph were a signature feature of the German defensive systems of 1917–18. (IWM, Q58649)\n\n6\n\nshelters and trenches to protect the front-line troops, who in turn used thick obstacle belts integrated with fire-swept zones to block Allied thrusts. The Germans named the new line the Siegfried Stellung after the mythological hero, but it was quickly christened ‘The Hindenburg Line’ by the Allies after its presumed creator. A workforce of 65,000 men began construction in late September 1916 and by March 1917 it was complete. Three further defence lines were developed from it in quick succession. The Wotan Stellung ran north from Arras to Lille. Meanwhile, the Hunding-Brunhild-Kriemhild Stellung ran south-east from Laon to Verdun, while the Michael Stellung ran across the base of the St Mihiel salient. Together they formed a shield from the North Sea, via Arras, Soissons and Verdun, to Metz. The Siegfried Stellung eventually consisted of up to four defence lines arranged in a zone 4 miles deep. These became known to the Allies as the ‘Advanced Hindenburg Line’, the ‘Main Hindenburg Line’, the ‘Hindenburg Support Line’ and the ‘Hindenburg Reserve Line’. In the sector between Cambrai and St Quentin, each ran broadly north to south with approximately 2,500m separation between them. Where specific areas of threat were identified, additional trenches were added, such as the ‘Marcoing Line’ and ‘Cantaing Line’ near Cambrai. Separately from the nomenclature outlined above, sections of each line could be named after localities at either end of them, such as the ‘Masnieres–Beaurevoir–Fonsommes Line’ also being used for the ‘Hindenburg Reserve Line’ between these villages. Between Cambrai and St Quentin, these lines exploited the Canal du Nord and the St Quentin Canal to provide additional obstacles. The former was under construction at the outbreak of the war and was mostly dry. The latter was built by Napoleon’s engineers and included the 6km-long Bellicourt Tunnel, passing under the watershed between the river Schelde and the river Somme. The forward trenches of the Main Hindenburg Line generally ran along the eastern bank of both canals where their paths converged, and ran north-west to south-east between Havrincourt and Bantouzelle to pass from one canal to the other. At the Bellicourt Tunnel, the Main Hindenburg Line defences swept to the west of the canal line to protect the de facto ‘bridge’ it provided, while barges in the tunnel itself also acted as shell-proof underground accommodation for the garrison. Each canal was faced with brick walls up to 3m high, and while the older St Quentin Canal (known as the Schelde Canal by the BEF north of the Bellicourt Tunnel in 1918) was around 11m wide, the more modern Canal du Nord was excavated to a width of up to 40m. Concrete dams had been constructed by the Germans to retain water in certain sectors while elsewhere deep mud prevailed. Wire entanglements were inserted into both. Where the canals crossed the rolling chalk downs between Cambrai and St Quentin, cuttings 15–25m deep existed to enhance their value as military obstacles. Two further tunnel systems existed in addition to that at Bellicourt. At Bellenglise a tunnel had been mined into the hillside behind the Hindenburg Main position to shelter approximately 3,000 men, while further south, the Le Tronquoy Tunnel carried the canal under the high\n\nground 5km north of St Quentin. South of St Quentin the line ran along the eastern bank of the river Oise, exploiting the river and its wide marsh-filled valley as a major obstacle to any Allied attack. By the end of 1917, the strategic situation had changed dramatically. The collapse of Tsarist Russia, and the advantage gained over Italy after the battle of Caporetto, enabled Germany to re-consider offensive operations on the Western Front once again. Here they now held the initiative over the French and British, whose armies were recuperating following the punishing Nivelle Offensive and the Third Ypres campaigns. This strategic opportunity was counterbalanced by the growing threat from the United States, which had entered the war in April 1917 as an Associated Power to the Entente, in response to Germany’s unrestricted submarine warfare. Although somewhat raw in skill and dependent on British and French industry for the majority of their equipment, the increasing strength of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) only promised to shift the initiative back towards the Allies from the middle of 1918 onwards. Consequently, sensing a six-month window of opportunity, on 21 January OHL ordered the launching of a series of massive assaults designed to defeat Britain and France before American strength could be brought to bear. In March 1918, the first of these blows saw the Hindenburg Line between Arras and St Quentin act as the springboard for the German attempt to destroy the BEF. Operation Michael saw the 17., 2. and 18. Armeen drive back the British Third and Fifth Armies an unprecedented 40 miles in 15 days of bitter fighting. Further assaults were launched in Flanders in April, on the Aisne in May, on the Matz in June and on the Marne in July, all of which also captured much ground and imposed heavy casualties on the Allies. However, although severely stretched, the Allied line held, and in the process exacted a huge toll from the Germans. Although the British and French suffered 288,000 and 225,000 casualties between March and the end of June, the German Army lost a staggering 688,000 men during the same period. These casualty rates fundamentally shaped the political context, where much trepidation remained in the Allied governments over the critical manpower shortages for the coming battles. The crippling human cost since 1914 resulted in both the British and French politicians developing plans for the war’s culminating campaigns to be fought in 1919 on the back of American troops now flooding into France. In Britain, the War Cabinet deliberated the future British strategy together with the Dominion governments. The Prime Minister, Lloyd George, wanted a return to an ‘eastern’ strategy to maximize Britain’s post-\n\nA reinforced concrete dugout entrance in the Hindenburg Line. These shelters were essential to protect the German front-line troops from the weight of Allied artillery. (IWM, E(AUS) 3581)\n\nAmerican infantry marching to the docks at Southampton for embarkation. Although Russia had been knocked out of the war, the prospect of American forces flooding into France during 1918 was a key factor in the German decision to launch a pre-emptive attempt to secure victory through the Spring Offensives. (IWM, Q70817)\n\n7\n\nBritish and French infantry fighting in the Bois de Reims, 23 July 1918, during the second battle of the Marne. The appointment of Foch as Supreme Military Commander at Doullens on 26 March 1918 greatly improved the cooperation and coordination between the Allied armies. Most of the major engagements saw one country’s reserves supporting forces from another when required. This was an essential improvement in the Allied effort to defeat the German Army on the Western Front. (IWM, Q11110)\n\n8\n\nwar Imperial benefits. He argued for manpower to be prioritized into the Royal Navy and industry, particularly shipbuilding, at the expense of the BEF which was to be reduced in size. He was supported to some extent by the General Staff at the War Office, but even General Henry Wilson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) and Billy Hughes, the Australian Prime Minister, pointed out that the war would only be won by defeating the German Army and that this would have to be done in France. On 16 August, the Cabinet agreed the compromise strategy to prepare the BEF to fight alongside the French and Americans on the Western Front in 1919 but with an army lavishly supplied with guns and tanks to offset the diminishing manpower base. Although these debates took place as the Allied fortunes improved following the battles on the Marne and at Amiens, the Cabinet’s fear of repeating the heavy casualties of the 1916–17 campaigns was deeply rooted. Consequently, on 31 August General Wilson sent Haig a telegram highlighting the risks that would be associated with a costly but unsuccessful attack on the Hindenburg Line. Unsurprisingly, Haig was furious at the lack of support he now felt he was receiving from London, describing the Cabinet as a ‘wretched lot’ in his reply to Wilson. Nevertheless, he travelled to London to reassure Milner, the Secretary of State for War, and to plead for more manpower to sustain the BEF. However, although Haig believed he had been well received, in private both Milner and Wilson feared ‘another Passchendaele’, with Milner stating that if Haig ‘broke’ the current BEF, there would be no other to replace it. Although the tensions between the French military and politicians were not as great as those the British faced, the French Army’s offensive capabilities were still fragile after three years of heavy losses despite its rehabilitation under Pétain, the French Chief of the General Staff. Notwithstanding the significant French-led victory on the Marne, on 31 July he warned Foch, the Allied Supreme Military Commander, that the French Army was now at the ‘limit of effort’, being over 100,000 men under establishment. As a result, Foch requested that the men due for conscription in 1920 be called up two years early, in 1918. The French Government agreed but with Prime Minister Clemenceau’s caveat that French blood was now the ‘most precious material’ and was to be conserved where possible. The German Army was also suffering a manpower crisis. In April 1918 it had 4,000,000 men on the Western Front and 1,000,000 on the Eastern Front. Casualty replacements for the West were provided in part by sick and wounded returning to duty, combing out rear area units and further redeployment of men from Russia. However, by July the army in the West had been reduced in strength to 3,580,000 and in the East down to 580,000. In response, Germany also called up their 1920 recruit class, which was expected to provide around 300,000 troops, but these would not be ready for deployment until the autumn on completion of their training. However,\n\nthe scale of the casualties was too great for even these measures. Consequently, the combat strength of front-line battalions could only be sustained by disbanding 22 infantry divisions and redistributing their manpower. Notwithstanding its manpower difficulties, Germany was also beginning to polarize politically. In response to the failure of the unrestricted submarine campaign, the centre and left-wing parties in the Reichstag formed a majority coalition on a ‘peace without annexations’ mandate. This majority was held in check for the time being by the right-wing minority, the Kaiser and OHL, who remained empowered following the victory over Tsarist Russia and the advances in the West. The situation was exacerbated by the tightening grip of the Allied naval blockade, which saw Germany’s civilian population slide towards starvation. Any potential source of relief from the East had proved too small in scale, as Germany was forced to balance the conflicting interests of the Bolshevik and Ukrainian regimes that blocked efficient access to the harvest. OHL desperately needed time to replenish the western armies and develop a stable and economically productive situation in Eastern Europe to support the German Empire. From the middle of July, as the Allies regained the initiative, the Hindenburg Line reassumed its pivotal role in both the Allied and German plans. On 24 July, Foch issued a strategic directive to drive the German forces from France and Belgium in three phases. First, the main railways in Allied possession were to be secured from German threat and the Germans pushed back to the defensive positions they held at the turn of the year. Second, a combined offensive was to break through these positions. Third, the Germans were to be cleared from France and Belgium. In response, Ludendorff planned to exhaust the Allies, successfully arguing against the Foreign Minister, Admiral von Hintze, at an Imperial Council at Spa on 14 August, that repeating the successful defensive battles of 1917 together with some limited offensives could deliver a negotiated settlement. But rather than withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line immediately, as argued by some senior members of the General Staff, Ludendorff could not bring himself to voluntarily surrender the ground bought with so much blood, consequently ordering the occupation of an extemporized ‘Winter Line’ running north–south from Noyon to Queant and anchored on the River Somme. However, events on the battlefield were now gathering their own momentum. Spearheaded by the Fourth Army, the BEF’s rapid successes during August pushed the Germans back across the old Somme battlefield, and on 31 August, the Australian Corps ruptured the German ‘Winter Line’ with a dramatic coup de main at Mont St Quentin north of Péronne. Faced with simultaneous pressure from the British First Army beginning to push south-eastwards from Arras, Ludendorff had little alternative than to order the further withdrawal back to the Hindenburg Line itself setting the scene for the climactic engagement.\n\nAn Australian soldier in the street fighting in Péronne, 3 September 1918. Although the Western Front is forever associated with trench combat, during the General Offensive much of the BEF’s fighting took place in villages as they fought the Germans for control of key transport routes or tactically dominating ground.

(IWM, Q9689)\n\n12\n\nMaréchal Ferdinand Foch was an artilleryman who had spent the vast majority of his pre-war career in staff appointments, culminating in 1908 as Commandant of the École Supérieure de Guerre. He led XX Corps through the frontier battles of 1914 before promotion to command 9e Armée on the Marne, and subsequently the Groupe d’Armées du Nord (GAN) through the Artois battles of 1915. His star waned somewhat following the Somme campaign in 1916 before he re-emerged as Chief of the General Staff of the Army in May 1917. By 1918 he had shown himself to be an effective manager of civil–military relations when he was summoned on 26 March to take over the role as Generalissimo of the Allied Forces in the face of the German onslaught. Throughout the war he demonstrated an energetic determination to drive his subordinates to better efforts on the front line. This was increasingly tempered with a reflective ability that underpinned his adept handling of political and military leaders in meeting the challenges posed by the German Army. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig commanded the BEF. A career cavalryman, he began the war in command of I Corps in 1914, before moving to First Army in 1915. Following the disaster at Loos in October he succeeded Sir John French as CinC of the BEF. He led the Army through the trials of the Somme, Arras and Third Ypres and oversaw its transition to a citizen conscript force from its Regular and Reservist foundations. Although he had a reputation for being a poor verbal communicator, British politicians were more suspicious of what they viewed as over optimism and questionable military judgement. However, having almost lost his post during the German Offensives in 1918, his support of Foch’s appointment as Generalissimo and his subsequent performance managing both him and his subordinate army commanders suggest an individual who was becoming increasingly effective as a strategic and operational level leader.\n\nFirst Army was commanded by General Sir Henry Horne. He led the artillery of I Corps through 1914 before taking over command of 2nd Division in early 1915. In November he accompanied Kitchener to the Dardanelles and by early 1916 had been appointed to command XV Corps in Egypt. In April he was recalled to France and reformed XV Corps as part of Rawlinson’s Fourth Army on the Somme. In October he was promoted to command First Army with which he oversaw the capture of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. He held this critical position and the Arras sector through the course of the German Spring Offensives in 1918. His combat performance throughout these appointments marked Horne as a consummate tactician. He was particularly effective in using firepower and other technology to assist his men and in exploiting the terrain in manoeuvring his force to advantage. Horne’s corps commanders in the Hindenburg Line battle were Lieutenant-Generals Sir Alexander Godley of XXII Corps and Sir Arthur Currie of the Canadian Corps. Although a British officer, Godley began the War as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. He led the composite Australian-New Zealand Division and Corps at Gallipoli before arriving in France in 1916. He fought on the Somme and at Ypres before the II ANZAC Corps was re-designated XXII Corps in 1918. Currie was a member of the militia before mobilizing to command a brigade at Ypres in 1915 and a division on the Somme and Arras in 1916–17. He was promoted to command the Canadian Corps for the battle of Third Ypres. He developed the reputation for thorough and pragmatic plans that maximized the use of firepower. Third Army was commanded by General Sir Julian Byng. Byng commanded 3rd Cavalry Division at Antwerp and Ypres in 1914 and early 1915. In May he assumed command of the Cavalry Corps before moving to Gallipoli in August to take over IX Corps at Suvla. After a brief period in command of the Suez defences in January 1916, he returned to the Western Front to lead XVII Corps at Arras. In May he was appointed to command the Canadian Corps and led them through the bitter autumn fighting on the Somme and the hard-won success at Vimy in April 1917. In June he was promoted to command Third Army and planned the ground-breaking attack at Cambrai with a predicted artillery barrage and massed armoured and infantry assault. In March 1918 he held his army together in the face of the Spring Offensive before breaking the back of the critical German assault on Arras. Byng’s corps commanders were Lieutenant-Generals Sir Charles Fergusson of XVII Corps, Sir Aylmer Haldane of VI Corps, Sir George Harper of IV Corps, and Sir Cameron Shute of V Corps. Fergusson commanded 5th and then 9th Divisions in 1914, seeing combat at Le Cateau and on the Aisne. In January 1915 he took over II Corps before moving to XVII Corps in May 1916, where he remained until the end\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Arthur Currie, GOC Canadian Corps.

Haldane commanded 3rd Division from the outbreak of the war until 1916, when he took over VI Corps. Harper was staff officer in GHQ before assuming command of 51st Highland Division in September 1915, and leading it through the battles of the Somme, Arras, Third Ypres and Cambrai. In March 1918 he moved to IV Corps. Shute commanded 59th Brigade in 1915 before leading in turn 63rd (Royal Naval), 32nd and 19th Divisions through 1916–17. In April 1918 he assumed command of V Corps. At the head of Fourth Army was General Sir Henry Rawlinson. Rawlinson was an infantry officer who briefly commanded 4th Division on the Aisne in September 1914 before leading IV Corps at Ypres, Neuve Chapelle and Loos. In January 1916 he assumed command of the newly formed Fourth Army for the Somme Offensive, but disappointing results saw him ‘sidelined’ during 1917 before moving to the Supreme War Council in January 1918. In March he replaced Hubert Gough in command of Fifth Army in the latter stages of Operation Michael and successfully defended Amiens from the final German assaults. He then oversaw the renaming of his force as Fourth Army and its rehabilitation through the summer, culminating in the successful attack at Amiens on 8 August. Rawlinson was a capable professional who repeatedly demonstrated pragmatic and practical solutions to the tasks faced by his men. By 1918, however, he had also developed the self-confidence to back his judgement against Haig’s in a manner that had eluded him in 1916. Rawlinson’s corps commanders were Lieutenant-Generals Sir Richard Butler of III Corps, Sir John Monash of the Australian Corps and Sir Walter Braithwaite of IX Corps. Attached to Fourth Army was also MajorGeneral George Read of II (US) Corps, which fought alongside Monash’s Australians. Butler spent much of the war in staff appointments in I Corps, First Army and GHQ. His offhand manner towards field commanders such as Rawlinson in this period was a source of lingering irritation. His operational command was limited, having assumed command of III Corps in January 1918, and he did not hold Rawlinson’s confidence. Monash was a civil engineer by profession and was a member of the militia before the war. He served as a brigade commander in Gallipoli and as a divisional commander on the Western Front. He took over the Australian Corps in June 1918, where he developed the reputation as cool and effective in combat. Braithwaite began the war in a staff appointment in the War Office, before deploying to Gallipoli as the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) Chief of Staff. Loathed by the Australians in particular for his perceived arrogance, his indifferent performance saw him recalled to London. In January 1917 he was assigned to command 62nd Division, which he led at Arras and against the German Spring Offensive at Bullecourt and Cambrai. He took over IX Corps on 13 September. Read saw action in the US–Mexican border campaign in 1916 before returning to Washington as a member of the Army General Staff. In April 1918, after a brief period in command of 15th Cavalry Division, he moved to 30th Infantry Division, which he took to France. In June he assumed command of II (US) Corps in preparation for the coming offensive.\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Walter Braithwaite, GOC IX Corps. (IWM, Q8932)\n\nIn GHQ Reserve were the Cavalry Corps commanded by LieutenantGeneral Sir Charles Kavanagh and XIII Corps commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Tom Morland. Kavanagh commanded 7th Cavalry Brigade in 1914 and, from April 1915, 2nd Cavalry Division. He moved to 5th Division in July 1915 where he remained until taking over the Cavalry Corps in 1917. Morland commanded 5th Division at Ypres in 1914 before taking over X Corps in 1915, which he led on the Somme in 1916 and Messines in 1917. He moved to XIII Corps in 1918. Supporting the British between St Quentin and the Oise was the French 1re Armée, part of the Groupe d’Armées Réserve (GAR). GAR was commanded by Général Émile Fayolle. Fayolle commanded a division at the Marne in 1914 and 33e Corps in Artois in 1915, before taking over 6e Armée on the Somme in 1916. In April 1917 he was promoted to command Groupe d’Armées Centre (GAC), before taking over GAR in March 1918. Général Eugène Debeney commanded the French 1re Armée. Debeney began the war as the Chief of Staff of 1re Armée before being promoted to command 25e Division d’infanterie and seeing action at Verdun in early 1916. He commanded 32e Corps on the Somme in April, before a further promotion to command 7e Armée in December 1916. A year later he returned to command 1re Armée, successfully halting the German Offensive between Amiens and Montdidier in March, before taking part in the August counter-offensive in the same sector. Acutely aware of the human cost borne by the French Army since 1914, his tactical approach primarily relied on firepower to avoid overextending the endurance of his men. Debeney’s Corps Commanders were Général de Riols de Fonclare of 15e Corps, Général Nollet of 36e Corps, Général Toulorge of 31e Corps and Général Hély d’Oissel of 8e Corps, who played a peripheral role in the battle. De Fonclare commanded 1re Division d’infanterie at Verdun and on the Somme in 1916, where he was promoted to command 33e Corps. In 1917 he took over 35e Corps at Verdun until it redeployed to Picardy in summer 1918 for the counter-offensive. Nollet commanded 129e and 66e Divisions d’infanterie in Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne 15\n\nin 1915. He took over 12e Corps at Verdun in 1916, before moving to 36e Corps on the Channel coast in March 1917. The corps fought on the Avre and in Flanders during the German Spring Offensive in March 1918 and moved back to Picardy in September. Toulorge commanded 27e and 130e Divisions d’infanterie between January 1916 and February 1918, seeing heavy fighting at Verdun. He moved to 31e Corps in February 1918, fighting at Villers-Brettoneaux in April and at Montdidier in August.\n\nGERMAN COMMANDERS\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II, Generalfeldmarschall von Hindenburg and General von Ludendorff. (IWM, Q23746)\n\n16\n\nThe de facto operational commander at OHL was General Erich Ludendorff. Ludendorff began the war as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Second Army and won national recognition for his role in the capture of the frontier fortresses around Liège in August 1914. He was rapidly deployed to successfully defend East Prussia as Hindenburg’s Chief of Staff at 8. Armee before leading it through the Gorlice–Tarnów counter-offensive in 1915. In 1916 he followed Hindenburg to OHL, assuming the position of ‘First Quartermaster General’. This shift into the grand strategic environment saw Ludendorff develop increasingly extreme nationalistic objectives. He proposed widespread annexations in the East to implement the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and also in the West, where even after the defeat of his Spring Offensive in the summer of 1918, he sought opportunities to retain German control of the occupied parts of France and Belgium. He retained tight operational and tactical control over the German armies, giving limited freedom of action to his army group commanders. This undermined his ability to work effectively with them. The German forces west of Cambrai formed the left wing of Heeresgruppe Rupprecht, commanded by Kronprinz Rupprecht of Bavaria. Rupprecht was a professional soldier who commanded 6. Armee in Lorraine and Flanders in 1914–15. He was appointed to lead the northernmost Heeresgruppe through the defensive battles on the Somme, at Arras and at Third Ypres in 1916–17. He possessed better military insight than most of his peers and proved himself to be a shrewd and effective commander. However, his failure to secure Arras and Ypres-Hazebrouck during the 1918 Spring Offensive and his army group being surprised at Amiens in August showed he was not infallible. The left flank of Heeresgruppe Rupprecht was defended by 17. Armee under the command of General Otto von Below. Below commanded I Reservekorps at the outbreak of the war and fought on the Eastern Front in 1914. He took over 8. Armee in November, which he led through the Courland Offensive in 1915. In October 1916 he was given his own army group in Macedonia, commanding German and Bulgarian forces before moving to the west in April 1917 to command 6. Armee at Lille. In September he moved to Italy,\n\nwhere he led the Austro-German 14. Armee’s stunning success at Caporetto. Consequently, he was returned to the West in February 1918 to command 17. Armee on the northern flank of Operation Michael. However, facing the better prepared defences around Arras, he was unable to repeat his Italian achievements and failed to capture the city. Below’s forces south of the River Sensée consisted of II Bayerische Armeekorps commanded by General Konrad Krafft von Delmensingen, XVIII Armeekorps, commanded by Generalleutnant Gunter von Etzel, and XIV Reservekorps, commanded by Generalleutnant Curt von Morgen. Delmensingen was Chief of Staff of 6. Armee in 1914 before taking over command of the Alpenkorps mountain division in 1915, leading it through Verdun and also in Serbia and Romania. In 1917 he was Chief of Staff to Heeresgruppe Württemburg before becoming Chief of Staff of 14. Armee in Italy for the Caporetto Offensive. He took over II Bayerische Armeekorps in April 1918. Etzel commanded 33. Infanterie-Division in 1914 before taking over 3. Kavallerie-Division on the Eastern Front. In 1918 he assumed command of XVII Armeekorps on the Avre and the Matz before moving to XVIII Armeekorps in August. Morgen commanded 3. Reserve-Infanterie-Division on the Eastern Front in 1914, then moved to I Reservekorps in November. He remained in the East until 1917, when his corps moved to the Western Front, fighting on the Avre and the Matz in 1918. In August 1918 he assumed command of XIV Reservekorps. South of Cambrai were 2. Armee and 18. Armee of Heeresgruppe Boehn, commanded by General Max von Boehn. Boehn was brought out of retirement in 1914 and assumed command of IX Reservekorps on the Western Front, where he fought throughout 1915 as trench warfare became established. In 1916 his corps saw action at Verdun on the ‘Giessler Height’ and the Somme before he was promoted to command Army Detachment ‘C’ on the Meuse in February 1917. In March he moved to 7. Armee in Champagne where he fought on the Chemin des Dames in May and at Malmaison in October. His army made significant gains around Reims during the Spring Offensive in May 1918 before he was appointed to command his own army group in August. Boehn was a highly experienced officer who celebrated his 50th year of military service in December 1917. He was an extremely effective tactical commander, winning the Pour le Mérite with Oak Leaves for his actions on the Somme and the Chemin des Dames.\n\nKronprinz Rupprecht of Bavaria (front row, third from left), Commander Heeresgruppe Rupprecht, with his staff.

(IWM, Q70778)\n\n18\n\nGeneral Adolph von Carlowitz commanded 2. Armee. Carlowitz began the war as the Minister for War in the Kingdom of Saxony and took over XXVII Reservekorps on mobilization. However, he failed to cope with the stress of combat at Ypres and was relieved of his duties. He spent the first half of 1915 in command of 12. Reserve-InfanterieDivision before moving to the Eastern Front in August to lead III Reservekorps during the Lake Naroch Offensive. He returned to the west in August 1917 to command XIX Armeekorps, which he led with some success on the Lys in April 1918. In August he briefly took over the 9. Armee until it was dissolved in the aftermath of the battle of Épehy. A week later he replaced Marwitz in command of 2. Armee. 2. Armee consisted of 54. Generalkommando, commanded by Generalleutnant Alfred von Larisch; IV Reservekorps, commanded by Generalleutnant Richard von Conta; and 51. Generalkommando, commanded by Generalleutnant Hans von Below. Larisch commanded the 10., 81. and Garde-Ersatz Divisions between October 1914 and January 1918, seeing combat on the Meuse in 1914, on the Eastern Front in 1915, at Verdun in 1916 and at Riga in 1917. He took over 54. Generalkommando in January 1918 and fought at Soissons in May. Conta commanded 1. Infanterie-Division on the Eastern Front in 1914–15 and at Verdun in 1916. In August he took over IV Reservekorps in the Balkans before bringing it back to the west for the Spring Offensive in 1918. Below commanded Augusta-Garde-Grenadier-Regiment from the outbreak of the war until 1916, seeing combat in Belgium, Poland and eastern Russia. In October 1916 he assumed command of 89. InfanterieDivision in Romania, before returning to France in January 1917 to lead 238. Infanterie-Division at Arras, Ypres and the opening assault of the Spring Offensive. He assumed command of 51. Generalkommando in August 1918. Defending the sector from St Quentin to the Oise was 18. Armee, commanded by General Oskar von Hutier. Hutier commanded 1. GardeInfanterie-Division in the West in 1914, seeing action on the Marne. Between April 1915 and January 1917 he commanded XXI Armeekorps before moving east to take over 8. Armee in April. Here he gained a formidable reputation for the exploitation of infiltration tactics and surprise artillery bombardments, particularly at Riga in September. He returned to the West in December 1917 to assume command of 18. Armee for Operation Michael, where he shattered the British Fifth Army on the Somme. I Bayerische Armeekorps was commanded by Generalleutnant Nikolaus Ritter von Endres. Endres commanded an infantry brigade until March 1915, when he was promoted to command 4. Bayerische-Infanterie-Division. He fought on the Somme in 1914, Loos in 1915, the Somme in 1916, Ypres in 1917 and Kemmel in 1918. He was promoted to command I Bayerische Armeekorps in June 1918. The other corps elements of 18. Armee were only peripherally engaged. They consisted of XXVI Reservekorps, commanded by Generalleutnant Oskar Freiherr von Watter, XVIII Reservekorps, commanded by Generalleutnant Ludwig Sieger and XIV Armeekorps commanded by Generalleutnant Friedrich von Gontard.\n\nOPPOSING FORCES THE BRITISH ARMY By September 1918 the BEF was at the peak of its combat effectiveness, although competing national manpower demands promised to diminish its strength if the war went into 1919. Its combat performance was built on increasingly effective tactical and operational techniques, being lavishly supplied with state-of-the-art technology and being well led by experienced officers and NCOs. The principle of flanking attacks on enemy positions – by now well established for small units – was beginning to percolate up into higher formation tactical doctrine. It was included in the latest draft of the manual SS 135 The Division in the Attack, which was being circulated across the BEF for comment during August and its influence was already apparent in battle. Critically, the BEF’s corps were beginning to manoeuvre more effectively with each other – such as the Canadian Corps and XVII Corps at the battle of the Drocourt–Quéant Line on 2 September – in order to crack the German line. The presence of the Australian and Canadian corps was a key advantage. Both had retained the 12-battalion structure in their divisions when the remainder of the BEF had reduced to nine earlier in the year; both retained command of all their national divisions, and the Australians remained an all-volunteer force throughout. This strong and relatively stable structure enhanced esprit de corps, developed effective command and control systems and maximized their performance in battle. While the British formations perhaps lacked the élan of their Dominion colleagues in general, several were equally effective, such as IX and XVII corps, as they would show in the coming battle.\n\nAn Australian infantry platoon receiving a briefing. Only 18 men strong, from an establishment of 50, this picture illustrates the manpower problems that were biting deep into the BEF. This was offset by an increase in firepower, with two Lewis guns on display supplied with spare magazines carried by several platoon members. The haversack on each man’s chest contained his respirator to protect against chemical attack. (IWM, E(AUS) 2790)\n\n19\n\nShells being manufactured in the National Shell Filling Factory in Birtley, County Durham. By late 1918, the full weight of British and Imperial industry was supporting the war effort. Between noon on 28 September and noon on 29 September, the BEF fired 943,847 rounds of artillery ammunition. It was the maximum expenditure in one day of the entire war. (IWM, Q27737)\n\n20\n\nBy 1918, each infantry platoon had enhanced firepower and assault techniques. The addition of Lewis guns and rifle grenades gave each platoon the firepower necessary to assault enemy positions independently, with both systems being used to cover the attack by riflemen and grenadiers. Where possible, these assaults were delivered from the flank or rear. There were usually four platoons to a company and four companies to a battalion. To increase the firepower available in support, 3in., 6in. and 9.45in. mortar batteries were available at brigade, division and corps levels respectively. Like the infantry, the artillery had seen a rapid development of its capability. Better quality control of shell production and calibration of each gun enabled the batteries to fire much more accurately than previously. Combined with better maps and survey techniques, these improvements enabled the gunners to hit targets without the need to range their shots. Co-operation with the infantry was enhanced by the development of ‘neutralizing fire’ to augment the traditional ‘destructive’ bombardment techniques, in order to cover the approach of the assault troops until they were within metres of the objectives. Each division had two field artillery brigades, each consisting of three batteries equipped with 18-pdr guns and one battery equipped with 4.5in. howitzers. Additional field artillery brigades and heavy artillery brigades equipped with 60-pdr, 6in., 8in., 9.2in., 12in., 14in. and 15in. guns and howitzers were available at corps and army level. The increase in quantity and quality of heavy artillery was fundamental to the improvement in the BEF’s effectiveness. In July 1916 it had 658 heavy artillery pieces in France. In July 1917 it had 1,744, and by September 1918 it had 2,206 on charge. When concentrated around the chosen assault sectors, these weapons gave the BEF the ability to dominate the German artillery ranged against them. Finally, the first British consignment of mustard gas ammunition had arrived to provide 32,000 rounds for Fourth Army’s 18-pdr and 6in. howitzers. Despite its limited success on the Western Front since 1914, the cavalry had retained and developed its capability as the exploitation arm. In September 1918 the Cavalry Corps underwent a fundamental reorganization as it prepared for the assault on the Hindenburg Line. The 2nd Cavalry Division was broken up, with the 3rd, 4th and 5th Cavalry Brigades attached to First, Third and Fourth Armies respectively, to provide an exploitation force under direct control of the front-line commanders for more timely employment. To replace them, the corps had been augmented with a ‘motorized’ infantry brigade in buses, two motor machine gun battalions, an infantry cyclist battalion and an armoured car battalion. The two remaining divisions each consisted of three brigades, each of three regiments. Although traditional cavalry weapons were retained, the troopers were equipped with the same Lee Enfield rifles as their infantry counterparts and fought with firepower as much as cold steel. In support of the corps was a mounted artillery brigade. Once the German front line had been penetrated, it was intended that this all-arms formation would strike deep into the rear and seize key railway communication centres.\n\nThe operation to breach the Hindenburg Line would rely greatly on the performance of the Royal Engineers, particularly in crossing the Canal du Nord and the St Quentin Canal. Each division possessed three field companies to support its brigades. A further field company per division was available for tasks in the army or corps areas. Basic ‘stock span’ steel bridging had been introduced early in the war, and in 1917, Hopkins and Inglis heavy bridges were brought into service, which would be critical for the task ahead. The Tank Corps would also be critical in assisting the Hindenburg Line assault, using its vehicles to breach wire obstacles and bring heavier firepower to bear on German strongpoints. The Mk. V tank was the mainstay of the force, armed with 6-pdr cannon or machine guns and driven by a 150hp engine at 4.6mph. Newer vehicles, such as the ‘Whippet’ light tank and a variety of armoured cars, had been developed to more rapidly exploit opportunities to disrupt the German defensive system in greater depth. Some of the Mk. V tanks had also been ‘stretched’ to provide space to carry infantry machine-gun crews to deeper objectives. All of the vehicles, however, were uncomfortable for their crews, required extensive maintenance and lacked endurance on the battlefield. Air support was provided by the newly formed Royal Air Force. Each army was supported permanently by an RAF brigade, each consisting of a corps wing, an army wing and a balloon wing. Each corps wing assisted the balloon wing in controlling artillery fire close to the front line and maintaining contact with the foremost troops in battle. The army wings consisted of bomber, fighter and fighter-reconnaissance squadrons to take the aerial battle beyond the front lines, to protect the corps wing and to deny German aircraft the opportunity to operate over British lines. In addition to each army-affiliated RAF Brigade, IX Brigade, consisting of two army wings and a night operations wing, was tasked by GHQ to whichever army required more concentrated aerial support. Attached to Fourth Army was II (US) Corps. This corps had been in France since July 1918, undertaking a period of training and deployments with the BEF at Ypres to develop its combat experience. While most American units similarly familiarized with Western Front combat had since been concentrated into the American First Army under Pershing on the Meuse, II (US) Corps had been retained in the BEF to offset British manpower shortages. II (US) Corps consisted of 27th and 30th Infantry Divisions, each of which was substantially larger than their BEF counterparts, being established for 28,000 men. Each division was made up of two brigades, each containing two regiments of three infantry battalions and supporting units. Although one American field artillery battalion had been retained, the remainder was provided by the Australian Corps. While strong in number and possessing high morale, II (US) Corps was critically weak in combat experience in comparison to the BEF. This was exacerbated by Pershing’s decision to remove junior officers for centralized American training, although given the pace and scale of American engagement in the war he had little alternative.\n\nBritish cavalry crossing the river Canche during the experimental exercise run on 17 September 1918.

(IWM, Q57694)\n\nMorale in the BEF was generally good following the successful summer operations, although the prospect of assaulting the Hindenburg Line with its formidable reputation was somewhat daunting. Fatigue was also a concern, as even elite units such as the Australians were beginning to show the strain of extended combat on the Western Front. They were, however, well trained, well equipped and confident in their leaders and themselves.\n\nTHE FRENCH ARMY Although the French Army of 1918 was tactically effective, the necessity to conserve manpower tempered its approach to battle. It also developed tactical techniques that maximized the used the firepower from artillery and machine guns to spare its infantry, with envelopment and flank attack being the preferred manoeuvre. Each infantry division contained three infantry regiments, each of three battalions of 700 men. Rifle platoons had rifle, bombing and light machine-gun squads. Each battalion had a machine-gun company and was equipped with 37mm infantry cannon alongside 45mm and 60mm mortars. The French units included a large number of troops from the French colonies. Zouaves were recruited from Frenchmen living overseas and had a tough fighting reputation, while the tirailleurs were recruited from the indigenous colonial populations. The artillery increased from 20 per cent of the army in 1914 to 38 per cent by 1918. The outstanding 75mm field gun from the pre-war divisions had been augmented with 105mm, 120mm and 155mm howitzers. These were supported in turn by heavier pieces, including the 220mm and 370mm weapons assigned to Debeney’s 1re Armee for the coming battle. Unlike the British, the French air arm had not become a separate service. Each army and corps had a number of fighter, reconnaissance and bomber squadrons. A proportion of the air service escadrilles had been grouped into a powerful Division Aérienne, but this was assigned to the MeuseArgonne operation. 22\n\nTHE GERMAN ARMY The German Army was in serious difficulties in September 1918. 17., 2. and 18. Armees had formed the spearhead of Operation Michael and received little respite in the subsequent months as the cream of their divisions continually shuffled from Flanders to Champagne to support the other assaults. The remainder spent extended periods in the line, exposed to the depredations of aggressive BEF patrolling, in particular from the Australians. Perhaps more concerning was that fact that their defensive positions seemed increasingly difficult to retain. Even when successful defensive engagements had been fought, prisoners had been lost in unprecedented numbers. This suggested that while the German Army remained a dangerous tactical adversary, morale was increasingly fragile. In short, it was rapidly approaching the point beyond which it could no longer continue the war. German defence was still based on the doctrine disseminated at the end of 1917. A forward zone approximately 500–1,000m deep consisted of small outposts to hold off enemy patrols and to disrupt small-scale attacks. Behind this was the battle zone approximately 2,500m deep. The forward edge was normally the main line of resistance and was held by the front-line battalions, with support and reserve units further back in each regimental sector. Behind the front-line divisions were the Eingrief divisions, tasked to move forwards when required to block penetrations and re-establish the original front line if possible. However, the understrength front-line divisions now lacked the manpower to adequately defend their sectors to the width or depth required. This resulted in too great a proportion of their infantry being pulled into the forward positions, where they remained under threat from the Allied artillery fire or flanking infantry attacks. Furthermore, those left to the rear were generally too weak to mount successful counter-attacks when required. The core of the German Army was the infantry division, consisting of three infantry regiments, each of three battalions, an artillery command and supporting troops. Although each division was established at 12,500 men,\n\nDismounted German cavalry launch a counter-attack. Due to infantry manpower shortages in 1918, 27 German cavalry regiments were dismounted and reorganized into three Kavallerie-Schützen-Divisons (5., 6. and 7.). Each KavallerieSchützen-Division consisted of nine cavalry regiments grouped into three KavallerieSchützen-Kommandos, each the equivalent of an Infanterie-Regiment. Each had a Feld-Artillerie-Regiment, and 7. also had a Füss-ArtillerieRegiment. (IWM, Q55024)\n\n23\n\nGerman field gun deployed in the anti-tank role in forward positions. (IWM, E(AUS) 3411)\n\n24\n\nmost were considerably below this strength by September 1918. In August, infantry battalion manning was reduced from 800 to 750 men, with those under 650 reorganized into three rifle companies instead of four. By the end of September, battalions were averaging 540 men strong. Regiments with battalions of fewer than 400 men were reorganized into two battalions. Each battalion had a machine-gun company with 12 guns, augmented by six light machine guns in each rifle company. A light mortar company with six 76mm mortars supported the riflemen and machine-gunners in each strongpoint to provide a deep, fire-swept zone in which to defeat the Allied assaults. The line infantry formations were augmented in 1917 and 1918 by Jäger and cavalry units re-grouped into divisional-sized formations and retrained for dismounted combat. The artillery command consisted of three battalions, each of two batteries equipped with 77mm field guns and one battery of 105mm light howitzers, and a heavy füβ artillery battalion, with two batteries of 150mm howitzers and one battery of 100mm guns. The divisional artillery was supported by batteries of heavier calibre guns and howitzers under corps and army HQ control. The British combination of armour and surprise artillery barrages since the battle of Amiens posed a significant tactical dilemma to the Germans. Whereas previous defensive doctrine envisaged the field guns being concentrated behind the main line of resistance for their own protection, an increasing proportion were now pulled into the foremost positions to provide close defence and anti-tank support. The remainder of the guns, however, were deployed further away in order to escape capture from the deeper British penetrations. These somewhat contradictory actions exposed the forward guns to capture in the initial assault, while those deployed in depth found it much more difficult to coordinate effective fire support to the front line. The disruption of the German defensive firepower in this manner was a critical factor in the late summer and autumn battles of 1918. The Luftstreitkräfte lacked the numbers of the Allied air forces, but possessed exceptional aircraft, and in September 1918, exacted a heavy toll during bitter combat. The fighters of the Jagdstaffeln (Jastas) and the ground attack aircraft of the Schlactstaffeln (Schlastas) were concentrated on the most active fronts, with only a smaller proportion permanently assigned to specific locations. The Jastas were increasingly equipped with the excellent Fokker DVII, while the Schlastas mainly flew the Halberstadt CLII and CLIV aircraft, specializing in lowlevel attack missions. Reconnaissance and artillery cooperation tasks were conducted by Fliegerabteilung (FA) and Fliegerabteilung (Artillerie) FA(A) units. During operations, the Jastas were normally controlled at army level to assist concentration of force, while control of the Schlastas, FAs and FA(A)s was normally devolved to corps level to ensure better integration with the ground battle.\n\nOrders Of Battle BRITISH ARMY, 27 SEPTEMBER 1918 FIRST ARMY – GEN.

The offensives of 1915–17 aimed to breach multiple defensive lines in one bound and consequently took significant amounts of time to plan in great detail. These intricate schemes often failed to allow for the uncertainties of combat, demanded too much from their inexperienced command teams and often chafed against competing national priorities. By late 1918, however, the Allied commanders were working with each other in a far more cooperative manner, with plans better attenuated to the capabilities of their troops, and which developed detail incrementally as the campaign situation developed. As the first phase of Foch’s strategic directive neared completion, the operational planning to breach the Hindenburg Line increased in tempo. Noting Pershing’s plan for an advance towards Metz, Haig wrote to Foch on 27 August, proposing that after the forthcoming American operation to reduce the St Mihiel salient, the AEF’s exploitation be shifted towards Mézières instead of Metz, to improve the mutual support between the Allied armies in the subsequent advances. This suggestion coincided with Foch’s developing plan to seize the key strategic railway linking Germany with the central and western parts of the front. But he also wanted to commence the exploitation as quickly as possible lest the Germans gain time to reorganize. The proposed change did not go down well with Pershing, who looked towards the St Mihiel–Metz operations as being the signal event of the AEF’s arrival in the war. However, after a series of fractious meetings and telegrams, Pershing agreed to the new plan with the proviso that the American contribution to the Mézières operation would be as an independent army alongside the French 4e Armée rather than as part of a larger French force. Consequently, on 3 September Foch issued a further directive, combining the Franco-US attack towards Mézières with the British thrusts towards Cambrai–St Quentin. Foch further developed the scope of his offensive on 9 September when he added an attack by the British, French and Belgian forces in the Groupe d’Armées de Flandres (GAF) to the original scheme. This was followed on 16 and 19 September by the addition of attacks by the French 5e and 10e Armées across the Aisne and Chemin des Dames to cover the left flank of the assault towards Mézières. Only the timing of each Allied thrust remained 29\n\nHaig’s plan Douai\n\nXX\n\nXXX\n\n220\n\nI BAY R\n\nN\n\nII tan ng Wo tellu S\n\nValenciennes XXXX\n\n17\n\nXXX XX\n\nII BAY\n\nFirst BR\n\nle\n\nSe\n\nXXXX\n\nBlécourt\n\nXXX\n\nXXX\n\nXVIII\n\n1\n\nCAN\n\nlde\n\nhe\n\nSc\n\n207\n\nB o ur lo n Wo o d 3 MAR\n\nXXXX XXX\n\nXVII\n\nXX XXXX\n\nXXXX\n\n2\n\n26 R\n\nVI\n\n2\n\nbre\n\nSam\n\n3\n\nXX XXX\n\n18 R\n\nXX\n\nLe Cateau Gkdo 54\n\nXXX\n\nXXX\n\nXX\n\n201\n\n7 XX\n\nCa n\n\nV\n\n2G\n\nXXXX\n\nBusigny\n\nXXX\n\nXXX\n\nIV R\n\nIII XXX\n\nAUS Fourth BR\n\nII US\n\n4\n\nGkdo 51\n\n21\n\nXXX\n\nXX\n\n119\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\nXXX\n\n5 BAY\n\ng lun Stel ion) Hermann struct ( u n d er c o n\n\na l du N ord\n\nIV\n\nHavr in cour t Wood\n\nXXX\n\nFor êt d e M or m al\n\nSolesmes\n\nXIV R\n\nXXXX\n\n38\n\nCambrai\n\nXX\n\nXXX XXX\n\nXX\n\n6\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\n1 GR\n\nThird BR\n\nSe l\n\ne nsé XXII\n\n22\n\nAubencheulaux-Bois\n\nXXX\n\nBohain\n\nXX\n\nXX\n\n1R XX\n\n232\n\nXX\n\nXXXX\n\n34 XXX\n\n25 R\n\nIX\n\nVerly\n\nXX\n\n8\n\nXXX XX\n\n15 FR\n\nXXXX\n\nI BAY\n\nGuise\n\n11\n\nXXX\n\nXX\n\n3L\n\nSt Quentin\n\nXX\n\nMont d’Origny\n\n206\n\nSom\n\n5 XXX\n\nXXX\n\n1. 2.\n\nXXVI R\n\nSt Q u\n\nan\n\nal\n\nme\n\n36 FR\n\nXXXX\n\n18\n\n1re FR\n\nXXXX\n\nC tin en\n\n31 FR\n\nXXX\n\n3.\n\nAlaincourt\n\n4.

While Foch was concerned that they would need to be sequenced to offset logistic constraints, Haig was equally worried about the need to draw away the German forces most heavily concentrated on the front he was to attack. After further deliberation, on 23 September Foch directed that what was now termed the General Offensive would commence three days later, with each operation being launched at one-day intervals. The Franco-US assault towards Mézières was to be launched first on 26 September, with the British assault towards Cambrai commencing the following day. The Flanders operation was to be launched next on 28 September, with the culminating British attack on the main Hindenburg Line defences north of St Quentin taking place on 29 September. The subsidiary attacks by the French 10e and 5e Armées were to be launched on 27 and 30 September respectively. This ambitious plan promised to stretch Ludendorff’s forces to the limit. The German Army had 190 divisions on the Western Front – 125 in the front line and 65 in reserve – but in response to the Allied campaign’s development during August and September, too many were increasingly threatened with isolation east of the Meuse. Whereas Armee Abteilung ‘C’ and Heeresgruppe Württemburg consisted of 25 front-line and 4 reserve divisions at the end of August, by 21 September they had been reinforced with a further six front-line and 18 reserve divisions to block any further American advance towards Metz and the east. This misconception was deliberately reinforced by Foch’s visit to Nancy and Belfort between 19 and 22 September. As the German reserves shuffled to the east, 17., 2. and 18. Armees reduced their combined strength by 18 divisions. In this respect, Haig’s aim to draw off German forces facing the BEF was already achieved, as the St Mihiel attack had become a feint for the General Offensive. In addition to his influential role in the development of the strategic and higher operational plans of the Allied armies, Haig was also deeply involved in orchestrating the tactical plans for the First, Third and Fourth Armies’ attacks. On 8 September, Haig asked his Army Commanders – Generals Horne, Byng and Rawlinson – for their opinions on the assault on the Hindenburg Line. All three agreed that while they should attack quickly\n\nGerman transport withdrawing across the St Quentin Canal at Bellenglise in September 1918. Each Infanterie-Regiment had 233 horses and 72 wagons to transport its equipment. Despite the advent of the motor vehicle, all armies on the Western Front depended on horsepower for transport. That this team is pulling two wagons highlights the acute shortage of draft animals in the German Army by this stage of the war.

In the background can be seen the effects of the smokescreens fired by the artillery to blind the German defence, the machinegunners in particular. (IWM, E(AUS) 3248)\n\n32\n\nto prevent the Germans reorganizing, due to the complexity and depth of the Hindenburg Line, the sequencing of discrete, limited scale operations would be required to disrupt the system without exposing their own troops to German counter-attacks. With Haig’s consent, on 11 September Third Army seized the fortified village of Moeuvres overlooking the Canal du Nord to secure their grip on the west bank and cover right flank of the Canadians to their north. The following day it secured the Advanced Hindenburg Line around the key village of Havrincourt. Further south, on 18 September, Fourth Army did the same between Hargicourt and Pontruet at the battle of Épehy. The conditions were now set for Horne and Byng to attack the Main Hindenburg Line west of Cambrai and Rawlinson to do likewise over the St Quentin Canal. Horne and Byng began their planning for the main assault on 15 September. Horne delegated the task of crossing the Canal du Nord to Lieutenant-General Currie’s Canadian Corps. Currie’s ambitious plan envisaged two divisions blasting their way through on a 2,500-yard front north of Mouevres. Thereafter, two further divisions were to join the assault as it fanned out to the north and east to envelop the heights around Bourlon Wood. Crossings over the Schelde Canal north of Cambrai were to be attempted if possible thereafter. In an attempt to impose an element of deception into the plan, Currie forbade daylight movement in forward areas, while Godley’s XXII Corps was to conduct operations to simulate an attack across the whole front south of the Sensée. In Third Army’s sector, Byng’s problems were more complex. Notwithstanding that the Hindenburg Line ran obliquely away from his right wing, the fact that Fourth Army’s assault was scheduled two days later than First Army’s, meant that he had to maintain contact with the advancing First Army on his left and the relatively static Fourth Army on his right. He therefore directed XVII Corps to keep up with the Canadians on the left, while VI and IV Corps echeloned back to the right to where V Corps was broadly holding its position. In conjunction with the Canadians, XVII Corps was to cross the Canal du Nord on a narrow front and then fan out to the east and south before closing up to the St Quentin Canal in the vicinity of Rumilly. Although the Canadians were left in relative peace to conduct their preparations, XVII Corps was not so lucky. For ten days prior to the assault, they had to fight off bitter counter-attacks from XVIII Armeekorps attempting to recapture Moeuvres. In the south, Rawlinson gave the main task to Lieutenant-General Monash’s Australian Corps who, together with Major-General Read’s II (US) Corps, were to breach the Hindenburg Line over the Bellicourt Tunnel. Eschewing the prospect of a difficult assault over the canal as it passed through its deep cuttings, Monash ordered the Americans to seize the Main Hindenburg Line between Bellicourt and Le Catelet before fanning out to the north and south. The Australians would then pass\n\nthrough them and capture the Hindenburg Support and Reserve positions. Should this be successful, the 17th Armoured Car Battalion and the 6th Tank Battalion were to pass through the Australian infantry and conduct a deep raid towards the German communications hub at Busigny and Le Cateau. III Corps was to link the Australians with Third Army to the north. Rawlinson accepted the plan on 19 September with a significant alteration. He included Lieutenant-General Braithwaite’s proposal that IX Corps would assault across the canal at Bellenglise simultaneously with the Australian and American attack. Throughout the week leading up to the main attack, both Lieutenant-General Butler’s III Corps and IX Corps attempted to widen the breach in the Advanced Hindenburg Line with limited success. Such was Rawlinson’s dissatisfaction with Butler, on 22 September Haig agreed to replace III Corps with Morland’s XIII Corps, but rather than delay the attack to effect this change, Rawlinson instead ordered the Americans to seize the Advanced Hindenburg Line positions between Hargicourt and Tombois Farm as a preliminary to the main assault. III Corps was to provide flank security. The Cavalry Corps was retained under Haig’s control but began to work up contingency plans to pass through either Third or Fourth Army and disrupt the German communications at either Valenciennes or Le Cateau. In the air, IX Brigade RAF would begin the process of isolating the battlefield overnight 26/27 September by bombing the key railway stations of Denain, Busigny and Le Cateau before switching their attention to German airfields the following day. I Brigade RAF was to prevent German forces crossing the Sensée from the north, to drive down German observation balloons and provide close air support, while III Brigade RAF did the same on the St Quentin Canal south of Cambrai. As Fourth Army entered the fray on 29 September, V Brigade RAF was to fly in support, with priority targets being the destruction of enemy balloons, impeding German reserves approaching the battle, and neutralizing artillery batteries firing in the open. From St Quentin to the Oise, Debeney’s 1re Armée was ordered to support the right flank of the British, but remained under command of Fayolle’s Groupe d’Armée Réserve (GAR). Fayolle’s mission also required him to support the left flank of the Meuse-Argonne operation with Mangin’s 10e Armée. Given that he was not the highest priority for resources across the French Army, on 20 September he instructed Debeney to operate with a strict economy of men and munitions to best husband those he had. Consequently, Debeney’s plan, distributed on 25 September, was to envelop St Quentin from the north and south. He gave primacy to 15e Corps’ assault, which was to assist 31e and 36e Corps’ southern pincer by turning the Hindenburg Line north of St Quentin. However, as 15e Corps was not due to enter the line until the latter part of 29 September, this attack would be impossible to co-ordinate with Fourth Army’s assault. In an attempt to resolve this contradiction, Debeney ordered 31e and 8e Corps to attack on 29 September between Urvillers and Cerizy to distract Hutier’s 18.

(IWM, Q9510)\n\n34\n\nWhile Foch and Haig were able to combine the efforts of their forces, Ludendorff was slowly losing his ability to do the same for the Germans. On 23 September, as the Allied focus shifted back to the west of the Meuse, OHL belatedly recognized that 22 of their reserve divisions were now poorly positioned in Alsace and Lorraine. In a desperate attempt to regain a more balanced deployment, orders were issued to move 12 divisions back across the Meuse to the west. However, the consequence of the increased number of divisions in Lorraine was a reduction in the reserves available to support 17., 2. and 18. Armees. Lacking the strength to defend the whole of their front in depth, Rupprecht and Boehn identified priority sectors in which to concentrate their reserve divisions. Four were deployed in 17. Armee covering the western approaches to Cambrai, three in 2. Armee covering the Bellicourt Tunnel and four in 18. Armee covering St Quentin. Critically, of 2. Armee’s reserves, only one division was in the Bellenglise sector now targeted by Rawlinson, and this had detached one of its three regiments to IV Reservekorps at Bellicourt. Three further reserve divisions under OHL control were located around Caudry and Le Cateau, with another two divisions further east around Le Nouvion and two more around Guise. The mounting Allied pressure was also beginning to fray the German command and control system, with Ludendorff increasingly in conflict with his key staff and army commanders. In August he imposed OHL direction to override Rupprecht’s attempts to refine tactical doctrine for defence of the German forward positions. On 6 September, he gave an erratic brief to his Heeresgruppen Chiefs of Staff, blaming the troops for the battlefield reverses. He outlined unrealistic plans to construct a new defence line to the rear – the Hermann Stellung – in weeks, when the comparable task of constructing the Hindenburg Line in 1916–17 had taken 65,000 men four months to complete. On 9 September, Oberstleutnant Wetzell, Chief of the OHL Operations Section, resigned after being repeatedly ignored by Ludendorff who increasingly interfered with tactical operations. More spectacularly, General von der Marwitz was relieved of command of 2. Armee on 22 September, after his perceived failure during the battle of Épehy, and replaced by General von Carlowitz. On 23 and 24 September, Wetzell’s replacement, Haye, published OHL’s latest estimate of the situation which forecast widespread Allied attacks along the whole line, including the Cambrai–St Quentin axis, but suggested that Lorraine remained as the primary threat. None of this augured well for the coming battle.\n\nTHE CAMPAIGN ‘AN ABUNDANCE OF COURAGE BUT TOO LITTLE TECHNIQUE’, 26 SEPTEMBER The campaign opened in the early hours as the American First and the French 4e Armies launched their assault on the Meuse, while at St Quentin, Rawlinson’s troops began their preparatory bombardment. The French and American infantry assault commenced along a 70km front at 0525hrs, and by the end of the day penetrations up to 7km had been punched through the defences of Heeresgruppe Gallwitz and Heeresgruppe Kronprinz. These were deepest either side of the Argonne forest, however, where the difficult terrain and intricate defences slowed progress. As the key heights at Montfaucon eluded capture, an American Staff Officer, Colonel George C. Marshall, observed that his inexperienced troops had, ‘an abundance of courage, but too little technique’.\n\nThe battle of the St Quentin Canal\n\nGiven the complexity of the defences which faced them, Rawlinson and Monash decided to revert to a preliminary artillery bombardment rather than rely on the surprise bombardments launched at zero hour, which had become the norm in Fourth Army since the battle of Hamel in July. To that end at 2230hrs, 1,044 field and 593 heavy guns crashed the first salvoes intended to disrupt the Hindenburg Line defences, suppress the German artillery and lower morale of the defending troops.

The destructive effect was limited, although Reserve Feldartillerie Regiment 55 lost a battery west of Joncourt, with 21 gas casualties. The neutralizing effect, however, was profound as the front-line troops, including those of 2. Infanterie-Division at Bellenglise, were forced to wear their respirators for extended periods or retreat underground where they were cut off from fresh food and water supplies from the rear. The barrage was programmed to continue until zero hour on 29 September, cutting wire in front of the canal, targeting the larger concrete positions, breaching the canal walls and finally destroying the telephone exchanges to break communications.\n\n‘ON THIS DAY WE BURIED ALL OUR HOPES OF VICTORY’, 27 SEPTEMBER The second day of the offensive saw the British First and Third Armies launch the second of the attacks at Cambrai, while the previous day’s operations continued. The Argonne attack recommenced at 0515hrs with the French push towards Somme-Py. However, the German defence was beginning to firm up, with machine-gun and trench mortar fire presenting stiff resistance to the assaulting infantry. Only a 2–3km advance was made in the east, with none at all in the west. In the American sector, V (US) Corps was able to capture Montfaucon but progress was beginning to slow. The rapid switch from St Mihiel was partly to blame, as Pershing was forced to deploy less well-trained formations, whose inexperienced administrative units were placed under severe pressure to sustain the large force in a remote region with limited transport infrastructure. Furthermore, the divisions deployed on the Meuse suffered from inexperienced leadership from their officers and NCOs, with Gallwitz’ men noting that small groups could delay much larger attacking forces.\n\n‘Break in’ at Cambrai – the battle of the Canal du Nord\n\nThe 16th Canadian Infantry Battalion moving forwards near Inchy-en-Artois. (IWM, CO3289)\n\n38\n\nAt Cambrai, although Third Army’s artillery commenced a wire-cutting programme on 18 September, while First Army’s guns engaged in deception shoots on XXII Corps’ front, no preliminary bombardment on the scale fired by Rawlinson was fired by Horne or Byng. However, fears that the assault troops would be hit by German artillery in their exposed assembly positions proved unfounded. As the assault infantry formed up, the overnight rain cleared. In the distance, the night bomber squadrons of III and IX Brigades RAF attacked those German headquarters that had been identified and Busigny railway junction. At 0520hrs the opening salvoes of the barrage erupted and tore into the German defences. 1st Canadian and 4th Canadian Divisions quickly crossed the dry section of the canal at Inchy-en-Artois and punched through the forward companies of 187 Infanterie-Division to secure the Canal du Nord Line by 0730hrs. Although the German artillery did reply, Horne’s deception plan worked, as much fell on the Arras–Cambrai road west of Marquion rather than the Canadians to the\n\nsouth. In XVII Corps, 52nd and 63rd Divisions stormed out of Moeuvres into the forward positions of the 7. Kavallerie-Schützen-Division manning trenches that had formed the original Hindenburg Support Line. Progress was slower than in the Canadian sector, particularly in the area around the ‘Sugar Factory’ on the Bapaume road, which resisted capture until 1440hrs, long after the Canadians had pushed around the northern flank of Bourlon Wood. Meanwhile, the engineers began the task of bridging the canal. In 4th Canadian Division’s sector, three bridges were passable one way for horsed transport by 0800hrs, and the bridge between Inchy and Bourlon was open for two-way lorry transport by 0820hrs. 1st Canadian Division’s engineers had more trouble from German fire, but had footbridges open by 1000hrs and a bridge for two-way lorry traffic by 1730hrs. The remainder of 1st Canadian Division, together with 11th British Division, poured over these and swung north, into the rear of 12. and 58. Infanterie-Divisions, who desperately moved back to face the new threat from the south. Some assistance for the defenders came in late morning and early afternoon, when the 1. Garde-Reserve and 22. InfanterieDivisions counter-attacked from their reserve positions. However, unable to coordinate their efforts, they were absorbed into the battle piecemeal rather than delivering the powerful riposte that was needed to halt Currie’s men. Consequently, they found themselves replacing the shattered 7. KavallerieSchützen-Division and 187. Infanterie-Division – including IR 188, whose history recorded the catastrophic loss of hope – to re-establish a new left flank for XVIII Armeekorps and cover the north-western approaches to Cambrai. To the south of Bourlon Wood, the final stage of XVII Corps’ attack stalled when 57th Division’s light signals meant to call the infantry forwards were confused with similar signals fired by the Germans as they launched their own counter-attack towards Anneux. Not until 1800hrs did the 57th move forwards to finish the day 1km east of Graincourt, some 3km behind the foremost Canadian positions to the north. Although Byng always intended his army’s attack to echelon back towards the right, his plan included a three-hour delay between the assaults of VI and IV Corps in order that the former could advance far enough to re-orientate their subsequent combined attack towards the east rather than north-east. Despite Haldane’s protests that the right flank of his corps would be exposed to fire from the high ground in IV Corps’ sector as they moved forwards, Harper refused to advance the timing of his attack and Byng decided not to make him do so. This lack of cohesion had significant consequences. VI Corps commenced their assault in conjunction with XVII Corps at 0520hrs. On the left, the Guards Division cleared the remnants of the Hindenburg Main Line and fought their way across the canal, but thereafter, resistance from 49. Reserve-Division along the junction with XVII Corps and from strongpoints around Flesquières delayed the remainder of the advance. Flesquières, along with the Hindenburg Support Line to the east, was cleared by 3rd Division, and by mid-morning, the 2nd and 62nd Divisions in the corps’ second echelon had pushed through to assault the St Quentin Canal at Marcoing. IV Corps launched its assault at 0752hrs with 42nd\n\nCanadian engineers bridging the Canal du Nord at Moeuvres.
