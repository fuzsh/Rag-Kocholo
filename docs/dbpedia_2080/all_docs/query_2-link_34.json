        "text": "1942\n\n15 Jul -\n\nActivated at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma under the command of Major General John E. Sloan. 1943\n\nJun-\n\nThe 88th participated in Third Army Louisiana Maneuvers #3.\n\nAug-\n\nThe division moved to Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\n\nNov-\n\nThe division stages at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.\n\n15 Dec-\n\nThe 88th arrivived at Casablanca, French Morocco from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarcation.\n\n26 Dec-\n\nAn advance party of the 88th echelon departed for Italy.\n\n28 Dec-\n\nThe Division moved to Magenta, Algeria and conducted intensive training for employment in Italy. 1944\n\n4 Jan-\n\nThe division went into the line as observers attached to 3rd, 34th, and 36th Infantry Divisions, and the British 5th, 46th, and 56th Divisions.\n\n3 Jan-\n\nA member of this advance echelon became the 88ths first KIA when Sergeant William A. Streuli of Paterson, New Jersey (a forward observer in B/339th Field Artillery Battalion) was killed by fragments from a bomb dropped by a Luftwaffe aircraft in the 34th Infantry Division sector. Lieutenant Elwin Ricketts, Battery B Executive Officer, became the first WIA when he was wounded in the same attack.\n\n6 Feb-\n\nThe main body of the 88th was transported to Italy in early February and concentrated around Piedimonte d'Alife for combat training.\n\n27 Feb-\n\nThe first 88th Division unit into the line was 2nd Battalion, 351st Infantry, which relieved elements of the Texas Divisions 141st Infantry Regiment near Cervaro.\n\n28 Feb-\n\nThe first artillery round fired in combat by an 88th DIVARTY unit was sent downrange by Battery C, 913th Field Artillery Battalion. It's target was a registration point at the Monte Cassino Abbey, the rubble of which was occupied by the Germans after the Allies bombed it.\n\n4 Mar-\n\nThe entire Division moved into the line at 1000 hours.\n\n5 Mar-\n\nThe division assumed responsibility for the sector previously occupied by the British 5th Division. At the same time, the 88th came under the control of the British X Corps, and deployed its three infantry regiments on line from the Mediterranean into the foothills to the east. Opposing the 88th in the strong fortified positions of the Gustav Line, were the German 71st and 94th Infantry Divisions. The Blue Devil infantry spent the next two months occupying and improving defensive positions and patrolling, while DIVARTY fired harassing and interdiction missions at German positions and suspected and known lines of communication.\n\n11 May-\n\nAt 2300 the Allied front in Italy began their last attack on the Gustav Line with the the 88th. In less than an hour, the 350th Infantry Regiment captured Mt. Damiano, key terrain overlooking the flank of the French units attacking on the Divisions right.\n\n12 May-\n\nIn that action, Staff Sergeant Charles W. Shea of F/350th took charge of his platoon after the platoon leader was killed and the platoon sergeant was wounded, and led an assault which knocked the defenders out of their well-prepared positions. For his actions that day, Staff Sergeant Shea became the first Blue Devil to earn the Medal of Honor.\n\n11-14 May-\n\nThe rest of the Division also pushed hard and forced the stubborn foe off the Gustav Line. The 351st Infantry stormed into Santa Maria Infante and engaged in a particularly bitter battle with the German defenders there. After more than two days of vicious combat, the 351st seized Santa Maria.\n\n11 May-\n\nThe 88th drove north to take Spigno, Mount Civita, Itri, Fondi, and Roccagorga. As the 349th Infantry Regiment passed through the 351st and continued the attack to the north, the 88ths operations took on aspects of a pursuit. Through towns like Itri, Fondi, and Roccgorga, the Blue Devils drove on toward Rome, effectively destroying the German 94th Infantry Division in the process. So badly battered was the 94th that it had to be withdrawn to Germany for reconstitution, and did not return to combat until October.\n\n29 May-\n\nElements of the 88th made contact with Allied units breaking out of the Anzio beachhead, reached Anzio on 29 May, and pursued the enemy into Rome.\n\n4 Jun-\n\nElements of the 88th were the first to enter the Rome. After the fall of Rome, the 88th was pulled out of the line to refit and prepare for subsequent operations.\n\n11 Jun-\n\nAfter continuing across the Tiber to Bassanelio the 88th retired for rest and training.\n\n5 Jul-\n\nThe Division went into defensive positions near Pomerance and relieved the 1st Armored Division in the vicinity.\n\n8 Jul-\n\nThe Division attacked Volterra at 0500 with the 349th and 350th Infantry Regiments abreast, with the 351st in reserve. Intending to envelop the objective from both sides, the attack successfully drove the defenders of the veteran 90th Panzer Grenadier Division from their choice terrain. Volterra was secure by 2200 hours.\n\n9 Jul-\n\nWhile performing security duties on the Divisions left flank, the 351st Infantry Regiment unexpectedly ran into a hornets nest near Laiatico on 9 July. Here, the regiment encountered Grenadier Regiment 1060, an element of the recently-disbanded 92nd Infantry Division now attached to the 362nd Infantry Division, as well as other elements of the 90th Panzer Grenadiers.\n\n12 Jul-\n\nThe 351st Regiment attacked again on the 12th with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions up and the 1st in reserve. The 3rd Battalion tore into the 1060ths 1st Battalion, destroying it and killing the enemy battalion commander.\n\n13 Jul-\n\nAll regimental objectives were secure; for its part in the attack, the 3rd Battalion, 351st Infantry Regiment was later awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation.\n\n13 Jul-\n\nVillamagna fell.\n\n20 Jul-\n\nThe Arno River was crossed.\n\n25 Jul-\n\nBy 25 July, the Fifth Armys offensive power had been spent; the loss of VI Corps and its veteran 3rd, 36th, and 45th Infantry Divisions to the impending invasion of Southern France prevented it from continuing the drive further to the north. The removal of the French Expeditionary Corps for participation in the same operation also diminished Allied combat power in Italy. Above the Arno, the units of the Germans Army Group Southwest were finishing their preparations for defense of the Gothic Line, and the Allied forces of the US Fifth and British Eighth Armies were going to require every ounce of power they could muster to breach the heavily fortified line in the mountains that ran from the Ligurian coast in the east to the Adriatic in the west.\n\nAug-\n\nMajor General Sloan was transferred first to a hospital in Italy, then to the States for treatment of a recurring disease. General Sloan was succeeded by the Divisions Assistant Commander, Brigadier General Paul W. Kendall.\n\n10 Sep-\n\nAllied forces in Italy attacked toward the Gothic Line and penetrated it in the central and Adriatic sectors.\n\n21 Sep-\n\nAfter a period of rest and training, the Division opened its assault on the Gothic Line and advanced rapidly along the Firenzuola-Imola road, taking Mount Battaglianear near Casola Valsenio on the 28th.\n\n27 Sep-\n\nThe 2nd Battalion - 351st Infantry Regiment earns the Distinguished Unit Citation for Monte Cappello. The fighting raged for days, sometimes literally at bayonet point,until the 1st and 2nd Battalions secured the top of the mountain.\n\n27-28 Sep-\n\nCaptain Robert Roeder, CO of Company G, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Monte Battaglia.\n\n27 Sep-\n\nThe 2nd Battalion - 350th Infantry Regiment earns the Distinguished Unit Citation for Monte Battaglia.\n\n30 Sep-\n\nThe 349th Infantry Regiment attack the village of Belvedere enroute to its objective, Mt. Grande.\n\n20-22 Oct-\n\nThe enemy counterattacked savagely and heavy fighting continued on the line toward the Po Valley. The strategic positions of Mount Grande and Farnetto were taken on 20 and 22 October.\n\n24 Oct-\n\nCompany G, 351st came closest to breaking through, but was literally wiped out at Vedriano, southeast of Bologna, on 24 October.\n\n26 Oct-\n\nThe 88th went over to the defensive in late October patrolling in the Mount Grande-Mount Cerrere sector and the Mount Fano improved positions, and rehabilitated its combat troops.\n\n22 Nov-\n\nThe Division relieved the 85th Infantry Division in its sector. 1945\n\n13 Jan-\n\nThe Division was relieved for general rehabilitation.\n\n24 Jan-\n\nThe division was committed in relief of the 91st Infantry Division near Loiano and Livergnano and after more patrolling and maintenance of defensive positions, the Division was pulled out of the line again for further rehabilitation and special training for the impending spring offensive to 2 Mar.\n\n1 Apr-\n\nThat offensive, which would finally defeat the Wehrmacht in Italy, commenced with a supporting attack by the 92nd Infantry Division on the Ligurian coast in the west to draw German forces away from the point of the impending main effort.\n\n9 Apr-\n\nAnother supporting attack, in much greater strength, was launched by the British Eighth Army on the Adriatic coast on 9 April. Finally, with the German reserves being decisively committed to meet these attacks at the extreme ends of the line in Italy, on 14 April, Fifth Army jumped off in the main attack against the German center.\n\n15 Apr-\n\nThe 88ths attack began at 2230 hours on 15 April, as its infantry regiments lunged toward Monterumici. In two days the Blue Devils knocked the German defenders off the key ridge.\n\n17 Apr-\n\nMonterumici fell on the 17th after an intense barrage.\n\n24 Apr-\n\nThe Po River was crossed as the 88th pursued the enemy toward the Alps.\n\n25 Apr-\n\nVerona fell.\n\n28 Apr-\n\nVicenza fell.\n\n2 May-\n\nThe 88th was driving through the Dolomite Alps toward Innsbruck, Austria to link up with the 103rd Infantry Division, when the hostilities ended on 2 May 1945. German forces in Italy surrendered although it took until early the next day to notify all Blue Devil units of the capitulation.\n\n4 May-\n\nElements of the 349th Infantry Regiment linked up with units from the 103rd Infantry Divisions 409th Infantry Regiment coming down from Austria where German forces had yet to surrender in the Brenner Pass.\n\n7 Jun-\n\nThe 88th Division assumed POW Command duties to repatriate a minimum of 100,000 Germans and to form an estimated 120,000 of them into service units. POW strength figures at the time indicated that the 88th Division had approximately 295,000 Germans available to accomplish this dual mission. Later figures raised this total above 320,000 as Germans came in out of the hills, unguarded German service units were discovered and taken over, and responsibility for the Czech PWs was transferred from the Fifth Army to the Division.\n\n1947 to 1954\n\nThe 88th in Occupation and the Free Territory of Trieste Trust Period.\n\nTRUST stands for Trieste United States Troops, the 5,000 man U.S. contingent based in the Free Terrority of Trieste created in 1947. The Free State was established in 1947 in order to accomodate an ethnically and culturally mixed population in a neutral country between Italy and Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the war, the 88th Infantry Division on occupation duty in Italy guarded the Morgan Line from positions in Italy and Trieste until 15 September 1947. It was then withdrawn to Livorno and inactivated. The 351st Infantry was relieved from assignment to the division on 1 May 1947 and served as the main component of a garrison command in the Free Territory of Trieste, securing the disputed border between Italy and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe command served as the front line in the Cold War from 1947 to 1954, including confrontations with Yugoslavian forces. In October 1954 the territory was ceded to Italy and administration turned over to the Italian Army.\n\nTRUST units, which included a number of 88th divisional support units, all bore a unit patch which was the coat of arms of the Free Territory of Trieste superimposed over the divisional quarterfoil, over which was a blue scroll containing the designation \"TRUST\" in white.\""
