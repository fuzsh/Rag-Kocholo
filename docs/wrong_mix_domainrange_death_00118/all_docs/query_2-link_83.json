        "text": "The room lurched again. Harry R. Truman held onto the chair and rolled with it. His spiked Coke jumped in its glass.\n\n“That’s a five!” he called out. “That’s a five!”\n\nSince the earthquakes began, about a month earlier, he’d become an expert.\n\nHe hopped to his feet and made his way to the bar. He watched the Rainier Beer sign sway back and forth.\n\n“Right now that swinging sign is moving at about 4.0 on the Richter scale,” he said. “But when it bangs into the back wall like it did a minute ago, that’s a five.”\n\nThere were no geologists on site to verify Truman’s calculation. They’d all abandoned the mountain by this point, hunkering down miles away to wait for the big bang. Truman had no plans to join them.\n\nIt was April of 1980, and the 83-year-old had made clear -- to family members, reporters, and even local law enforcement -- that he was staying put at his Mount St. Helens Lodge on Spirit Lake, despite the volcanic eruption that was expected to come.\n\nTruman’s “disheveled recreation and fishing lodge,” as The Oregonian described it, was empty, except for the proprietor and his 16 cats. The business wasn’t offering up any revenue anymore, which didn’t bother Truman.\n\n“I’ve kind of retired since that Labor Day,” he said. “Just rent enough boats and cabins to keep the booze supply full.”\n\nThe Labor Day he was talking about had nothing to do with the rumbling mountain that had sparked evacuations all around him. It was three years earlier -- the day his wife Edna died.\n\n“She was a beautiful woman, and everyone liked her and knew her as Eddie,” he told a reporter who made the trek to the lodge at the base of Mount St. Helens. “She had never had any heart problems, but all at once a big heart attack and she was gone. That broke me up real bad.”\n\nHe gazed around at the cluttered room, then out the window.\n\n“I’ve kind of let the place go to hell since then,” he added. “Eddie and I had spent 37 years loving, working, fighting, laughing, dancing and really living on our mountain and lake. Go look at the old pictures I have on the wall over there -- she was some woman.”\n\nTruman -- everyone called him by his last name -- was lonely, which was why he welcomed visiting journalists and geologists and talked them into the ground. And sometimes, when he’d had enough Schenley’s and Coke, he’d admit he was scared.\n\nBut he was staying because the lodge was his home, his and Eddie’s.\n\nHe had leased the land from Burlington Northern Railroad in the late 1920s. A divorced, struggling mechanic at the time, the World War I veteran saw an opportunity to create a new life for himself, in the most pristine and beautiful spot he’d ever seen. He began building the multistory lodge by himself. The cottages, dotted here and there around the property, came next. He rented them out -- along with boats and even horses -- to fishermen and backpackers and adventurers.\n\nA few years after he launched the business, a young woman stepped into the front room of the main building. Edna was in a bad marriage and needed to clear her head, so her sister had suggested the Mount St. Helens Lodge on Spirit Lake.\n\n“She was really pretty -- she could have been a movie star if she wanted to be,” says Edna’s niece Shirley Rosen. “She and Truman ended up having an affair.”\n\nIt wasn’t just an affair. It was love at first sight. Desperate love. L’amour fou. Edna divorced her husband and took up residence at the lodge. Soon she and Truman married.\n\n“He worshipped her,” recalls Rosen, 86, who worked at the lodge as a teenager in the late 1940s and, more than 30 years later, wrote a book about her uncle, “Truman of St. Helens: The Man and His Mountain.”\n\nTruman believed Mount St. Helens had a lot to do with the crazy love he and Eddie had. The mountain loomed over them at all times, its snow-capped top glinting in the sun. It was hard work running the lodge, and they didn’t make much money at it, but they never wanted to leave.\n\n“They’ll never get me off this mountain,” Truman said that earthquake-filled April of 1980. “Spirit Lake and Mount St. Helens are a part of me -- they’re mine. They’re as much a part of me as my arms and legs.”\n\nAnd so he tried to convince himself that everything would be okay. He speculated there wasn’t much left inside Mount St. Helens after weeks of it burping up who knew what.\n\n“I think it’s shot its wad,” he said.\n\nAnd if the mountain did erupt, he was certain the pyroclastic flow would head down the other side, away from his lodge.\n\n“No, that mountain will never hurt me,” he insisted.\n\nTruman had been a beloved figure in the isolated region for years. “He was salty and crusty and caring,” Rosen says. Some of his regulars -- including U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas -- came back to the lodge as much for Truman as for the fishing and beautiful vistas.\n\nAnd then, after the mountain began to shake and he refused to leave the evacuation zone, he became a national celebrity.\n\nOne TV-news reporter pointed out that Truman was “not related to the former president” of the same name “but is just as feisty.”\n\nThat he was. He dared anyone to try to make him leave his lodge, insisting it would take a mule team to do it.\n\nAmericans watching him on TV couldn’t get enough. Songs were written about him, including “Ode to Harry Truman” and, inevitably, “Give ’Em Hell Harry.” School children wrote him letters begging him to change his mind and leave the lodge. A memorabilia company coined a silver “collector’s medallion” that depicted Mount St. Helens on the front and the baseball-cap-wearing Truman on the flip side. When it was all over -- after the mountain had erupted, mowing down some 200 square miles of forest -- Oscar-winning actor Art Carney would play the crusty old lodge proprietor in a movie.\n\nTruman took the attention in stride, recognizing that Mount St. Helens -- his first true love, though not his greatest one -- was the real star.\n\n“Life comes in three parts,” the West Virginia native said. “First you work your ass off and get a few coupons to clip. Then you hang around the crest for a while. Then it’s all downhill and clipping coupons if you’re lucky -- just riding her out. That’s where I am now, kind of coming down the hill.”\n\nHarry R. Truman was last seen at about 6 p.m. on May 17 at his lodge, just riding her out. The mountain erupted the next day, northward toward his -- and Eddie’s -- longtime home.\n\n-- Douglas Perry\n\n@douglasmperry"
