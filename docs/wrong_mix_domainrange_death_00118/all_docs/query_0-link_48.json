        "text": "40 Aspiring Community College Presidents Will Participate in\n\n2021-2022 Aspen Rising Presidents Fellowship to Advance Student Success\n\nThe Aspen Institute College Excellence Program today announced that Kate Connor, Vice President of Academic & Student Affairs at Harry S. Truman College, is one of 40 leaders selected for the 2021-22 class of the Aspen Rising Presidents Fellowship, a highly selective leadership program preparing the next generation of community college presidents to transform institutions to achieve higher and more equitable levels of student success.\n\n“I am excited about this opportunity, and I am looking forward to learning from the fellowship and my peers in the program. I hope to be able to bring what I learn back to City Colleges of Chicago to further support our work in our communities across the City,” said Vice President, Kate Conner.\n\nThe Rising Presidents Fellows will embark on the 10-month fellowship beginning in November 2021. Delivered in collaboration with the Stanford Educational Leadership Initiative, the fellows will be mentored by esteemed current and former community college presidents who have achieved exceptional outcomes for students throughout their careers, and will learn strategies to improve student outcomes in and after college, lead internal change, and create strong external partnerships with K-12 schools, four-year colleges, employers, and other partners.\n\n“To become institutions that truly advance social mobility and talent development, community colleges must have presidents with a clear vision for equitable student success,” said Monica Clark, director of leadership initiatives at the College Excellence Program. “We have selected these fellows because they share that commitment and are well-positioned to become transformational leaders.”\n\n“Truman College and all of City Colleges of Chicago is transforming lives through education. We are very proud of Kate Connor for her leadership and commitment to our students. This fellowship will help to galvanize her abilities and knowledge, all in service to our students,” said Dr. Shawn Jackson, President of Harry S. Truman College.\n\nThe Aspen Rising Presidents Fellowship responds to the growing need for a new generation of leaders well-equipped to meet the challenges of the future. Nationally, nearly 80 percent of sitting presidents’ plan to retire in the next decade. While the traditional pathway to the presidency has often excluded women and people of color, the incoming class of Aspen Rising Presidents Fellows is composed of 68 percent women and 70 percent people of color, and represents institutions of varying sizes and locations.\n\nTogether, the 2021-22 fellows are leaders at colleges that collectively serve more than 400,000 students. As well, 67 Rising Presidents Fellowship alumni have become presidents of community colleges that collectively serve an additional 953,000 students nationwide.\n\n2021-22 Aspen Rising Presidents Fellows\n\nAarti Dhupelia, National Louis University (IL)\n\nAisha Noni Lowe, California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CA)\n\nArlene Rodriguez, Middlesex Community College (MA)\n\nCedric Bradley, Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College (MS)\n\nClarissa Cota, College of Southern Nevada (NV)\n\nCory Clasemann, Ivy Tech Community College (IN)\n\nDenise Douglas, Lorain County Community College (OH)\n\nDiane Stiles, Lake Area Technical College (SD)\n\nEdgar Soto, Pima Community College (AZ)\n\nEric Dunker, Arapahoe Community College (CO)\n\nGeorge Timmons, Columbia-Greene Community College (NY)\n\nHeather Bigard, Lake-Sumter State College (FL)\n\nHelen Castellanos Brewer, SUNY Rockland Community College (NY)\n\nIris Freemon, Dallas College (TX)\n\nJean Marie Runyon, Front Range Community College (CO)\n\nJennifer Diane Eccles, Minnesota State HealthForce Center of Excellence (MN)\n\nJessica Robinson, Cuyamaca College (CA)\n\nKate Connor, Harry S Truman (IL)\n\nKathryn Anne Rogalski, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (WI)\n\nKimberly Hurns, Washtenaw Community College (MI)\n\nKristen Raney, Saint Paul College (MN)\n\nLamata Mitchell, Pima Community College (AZ)\n\nLevy Brown, Jr., Vance-Granville Community College (NC)\n\nLizette Navarette, California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CA)\n\nMichelle Schutt, College of Southern Idaho (ID)\n\nMike Munoz, Long Beach City College (CA)\n\nMonica Parrish Trent, Achieving the Dream, Inc.
