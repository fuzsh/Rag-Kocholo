        "text": "While Tom Corbin’s highly coveted art works can be found in a veritable “Who’s Who” of public, private, and corporate collections and even spotted adorning the walls of fictional collectors in television and film stories, it’s probably safe to say his most outstanding accomplishment is his larger-than-life bronze statue of 33rd U.S. President Harry S. Truman, which was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., in late September of 2022.\n\nOn Sunday, February 18, from 10:00am until noon, the Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation will host the master artist for a special presentation to be held on the grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House, 111 Front Street, during which he will discuss the tools, research and processes he employed for his monumental undertaking, answer audience questions, and share insights on where he finds his inspiration. His presentation is a feature of this year’s “Presidential Families Weekend” events, and also launches the Foundation’s new TRU-ly Amazing Art series.\n\nBased in Rosedale, Kansas, Corbin’s studio and gallery are housed in a historic 1912 firehouse with a compelling history of its own, reflected in preserved artifacts and fixtures that include a brass fire pole, a bank safe, and a jail cell. But art was not his first career, advertising was, and he reports that he came to art via “more serendipity than calculation.” Ahead of his Key West appearance, the artist agreed to answer a few questions about how he got from “there” to “here.”\n\nQ: Can you describe what motivated you to explore your artistic potential?\n\nGrowing up with a mother who taught elementary school art, I was exposed to a number of art disciplines at an early age. Continually drawing for my own pleasure through high school and college, I never considered art seriously as a vocation. I assumed it would be a nice hobby to have.\n\nA variety of traditional sales jobs followed college graduation. My yearning for more creative employment eventually led me into the advertising business as an account executive. A friend at the agency introduced me to a bronze sculptor who was holding classes out of her home on Wednesday nights. Just for something different, I decided to attend her class.\n\nQ: Was there a turning point moment that caused you to make the leap from advertising executive to full-time artist?\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, I realized there were few bronze sculptors in the Midwest. With my growing passion for casting and with the marketing knowledge I was gaining at the agency, I sensed that a career in art, sculpture specifically, might be possible. So, in 1986, I quit my ad job, rented a loft space and never looked back.\n\nQ: Your Harry S. Truman bronze statue is 8’ tall – 11’ if you count the pedestal. Had you ever created a human sculpture prior to this undertaking, and one of this scale?\n\nI have done a number of life size and monumental human sculptures during my 37-year career. Soldiers, firemen, dancers, you name it. But I have never been involved with a commission of this significance and social impact. It has been such an honor to be involved with this project.\n\nQ: You were one of multiple artists invited to submit sculpture proposals, and then later as a finalist, a preliminary model, or maquette. What are one or two features of yours that you feel were key to you winning the commission?\n\nThrough my research of Truman, I discovered that he truly considered himself a common man. He lacked pretense, was quick to shake your hand and relished a brisk walk around the White House or his home in Independence, MO. In addition to studying Harry, I also examined the existing sculptures in Statuary Hall, many of which seemed stoic and unapproachable. I wanted my Truman model to display just the opposite: relaxed and in motion, as if to greet you. To accomplish this, I have the President descending a set of stairs with his smile intact.\n\nQ: How long did it take for you to create the monument, from beginning to end and what was your biggest challenge?\n\nFrom being awarded the commission to unveiling Harry took four years. The actual time I spent sculpting the 8-foot Harry was about a year. The remaining time included molding, casting and waiting for approvals at each stage of development both on the state and federal level. The biggest challenge was the ability to please all the individuals involved whose approval was required. Also...patience was a necessity.\n\nCorbin’s Truman Statue, situated between George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, is the tenth presidential statue to be installed in the Capitol Rotunda. It was commissioned by the Truman Library Institute for the State of Missouri, and funded through the support of Truman Statue sponsors. Much of Corbin’s research for the project was conducted at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nThe “Presidential Families Weekend” and Tom Corbin’s “TRU-ly Amazing Art” event are presented with the support of the Monroe County Tourist Development Council. For tickets and more information visit www.trumanlittlewhitehouse.org/foundation/events/\n\nThe Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation, in partnership with The Society of Presidential Descendants, is pleased to announce a series of special events to be held in celebration of Presidents’ Day Weekend, Thursday, February 15, through Monday, February 19, 2024, on the elegant tropical grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House in Key West, Florida, where 33rd U.S. President Truman spent 11 working vacations from 1945-53.\n\n​\n\nKicking off events on Thursday, February 15, from 5:30-7:30pm, is a special “Happy Hour at Harry’s Cocktail and Trivia” evening at which politicophiles can enjoy cocktails from “Harry’s Bar” while competing for prizes and glory in a presidential trivia battle of the brains.\n\nCenterpiece of the multi-day event is a Saturday, February 17, forum discussion on the topic of \"Political Maneuvering: The Powerful Influence of the Presidency” to be held among a gathering of distinguished presidential descendants before a live audience.\n\nModerated by Dr. Kurt Graham, Director of Independence, Missouri’s federally operated Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, this year’s scheduled forum participants are: James Carter, grandson of 39th U.S. President Jimmy Carter; Clifton Truman Daniel, grandson of 33rd U.S. President Harry S. Truman; Ulysses Grant Dietz, great-grandson of 18th U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant; Mary Jean Eisenhower, granddaughter of 34th U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Massee McKinley, great-great grandson of 22nd and 24th U.S. President Grover Cleveland; and Patricia Taft, great-granddaughter of 27TH U.S. President William H. Taft.\n\nReturning by popular demand for the 2024 Presidential Families Weekend are two live performances of “Give ‘Em Hell, Harry!”, the long running, highly acclaimed stage production written by Samuel Gallu that spotlights the life and presidency of Harry S. Truman. Clifton Truman Daniel has starred in the role of his grandfather since 2017, and is the first direct descendant to portray a presidential ancestor in a stage production of this kind. A fast paced, faithful to history, and often humorous one-man-show, “Give ‘Em Hell, Harry!” will be performed Sunday evening, February 18, and as the long weekend’s finale event on Monday evening, February 19, with each beginning at 4:30pm. Staged outdoors on the grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House, tickets for previous year’s performances have quickly sold out.\n\nOn Sunday the 18th, from 10:00am until noon, the Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation will welcome renowned master artist Tom Corbin, creator of the monumental Harry S Truman bronze sculpture on display in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington D.C. Part of the Foundation’s TRU-ly Amazing Art series, in his presentation, Corbin will share insights on his tools and processes and where he finds his inspiration.\n\nPresidents’ Day, Monday, February 19, the Little White House grounds will provide the setting for a family-friendly “Presidents’ Day Cookout,” with hamburgers, veggie burgers, and hotdogs available for purchase. A cash bar will also be available, and attendees are welcome to bring a picnic blanket for the 11:30am to 1:30pm event that will also include music and lawn games.\n\nOther “Presidential Families Weekend” offerings are to include guided tours of the Historic Little White House and self-guided botanical lawn tours.\n\nThe annual “Presidential Families Weekend” held at the Harry S. Truman Little White House in Key West is the largest Presidents Day Weekend gathering of presidential descendants in the country. Traditionally hosted by The Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation, in 2022 the Foundation partnered for the first time with the Society of Presidential Descendants, a membership organization for individuals with direct lineage to one or more of the forty-six United States Presidents.\n\nIn the spirit of fostering youth political awareness and participation, the Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation and The Society of Presidential Descendants have announced an essay contest for Monroe County High School Students, with submissions to reflect this year’s “Political Maneuvering: The Powerful Influence of the Presidency” theme. In addition to cash prizes, First, Second and Third place winners will receive tickets to attend the Saturday, February 17 forum, where attending presidential descendants will introduce the winning students to the audience following the discussion. Interested students have until January 15 to submit their compositions.\n\nThe “Presidential Families Weekend” and the Tom Corbin “TRU-ly Amazing Art” event are presented with the support of the Monroe County Tourist Development Council.
