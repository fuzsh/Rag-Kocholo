        "text": "The Death and Funeral of Harry S. Truman\n\n“The Nation to which he gave so much will honor his memory in admiration and respect, and the other countries for which he helped keep freedom alive will remember his name with gratitude.” –President Richard Nixon (December 26, 1972)\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman died at 7:50 a.m. on December 26, 1972. The nation mourned, honoring the 33rd President with military pomp and memorial services at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum. His widow, former First Lady Bess Truman, and their daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel, chose to keep the ceremonies subdued and close to home instead of holding a full state funeral in Washington, D.C. Some 75,000 mourners passed through the Truman Library as he lay in state on December 27 and 28. Funeral services and burial in the Truman Library courtyard, in a spot he personally selected, were conducted on December 28.\n\nSince that moment and those ceremonies, President Truman’s reputation for decisiveness and straight talk have made him one of the most respected and frequently quoted former Presidents. His legacy includes a host of critical decisions that still shape the world today.\n\nThe Truman Library’s online photo database includes nearly 200 photos documenting the death and funeral of President Truman. We have collected 24 of our favorites.\n\nThe President Is Dead\n\nFollowing the death of former president Harry S.
