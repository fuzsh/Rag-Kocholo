        "text": "​Fran Decker is a long time Key West-based artist acclaimed for her vivid and widely collected paintings of local landmarks, conch houses, marine themes, island critters and flora. On Saturday, August 10, from 10:00am – 1:00pm, she will lead a “Paint & Sip” event on the grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House, 111 Front Street, Key West Florida. We caught up with the artist in advance of the event for some Q and A about her and her work:\n\nQ: When/how did your interest in art first emerge/manifest, and when/how did you realize you had a talent for it?\n\nFD: My mother loved painting and other craft endeavors so there were always art supplies around the house when I was growing up and she encouraged anything creative. I painted my first “good” painting at age 12.\n\nQ: When and how did you sell your first painting (or when/how did you go pro)?\n\nFD: I was taking an art class at the Audubon House with Judi Bradford and she encouraged me to try selling my art so I joined Island Arts Co-op.\n\nQ: Was there any particular painting skill you found particularly challenging to master and how did you meet that challenge?\n\nFD: I am good at color and composition but not drawing. I’ve learned some great “secrets” from artist and Cocco & Salem Gallery co-owner Jim Salem. I’ve been a regular at his Thursday classes for 20 years.\n\nQ: Any artists in your lineage; paint in your veins?\n\nFD: Not pro, but I’ve got some talented relatives. In addition to my mother, who painted some wonderful paintings, my paternal grandmother was also a skillful painter.\n\nQ: What other artist from any era would you most like to meet and why?\n\nFD: I’d like to do a paint and sip with Salvador Dali because his work is deliciously different and weird.\n\nQ: Top three reasons people should attend your “Paint & Sip” event?\n\nFD: 1) Plein Air painting forces you to see the big picture and not get hung up on details. There’s something magical about painting on site within a limited amount of time. 2) Painting with others is inspiring. I love seeing what unique ways people approach the same subject. 3) Paint and Sip….Drinks! Two of my favorite activities.\n\nThe August 10 “Paint & Sip” with Fran Decker is the final of three 2024 “TRU-ly Amazing Art” events presented by the Harry S. Truman Foundation. Participants will be provided with an authentic 1911 roof shingle from the Truman Little White House as their canvas. Artists BYO outdoor painting supplies, such as easel or plein air box and tripod, paint, brushes, brush washing container, etc. Wine, champagne, and non-alcoholic beverages will be available, with the first one complimentary for participants.\n\nThe mission of the Harry S. Truman Foundation is to preserve Florida’s only presidential museum—the Harry S. Truman Little White House—and to provide programming that supports civic engagement, education, and the historical and cultural influences of the Truman era.\n\n​\n\nTRU-ly Amazing Art events are presented with the support of the Monroe County Tourist Development Council. Tickets and registration are available at www.trumanlittlewhitehouse.org/foundation/events/.\n\nThe Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation, in partnership with The Society of Presidential Descendants, is set to host a series of special events in celebration of Presidents’ Day Weekend, Saturday, February 18, through Monday, February 20, 2023, on the elegant tropical grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House in Key West, Florida.\n\nCenterpiece of the multi-day event is a Saturday, February 18, forum discussion among a gathering of distinguished presidential descendants on the topic of \"Working Across the Aisle: American Bipartisanship.”\n\nModerated by Dr. Kurt Graham, director of Independence, Missouri’s federally operated Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum, this year’s scheduled participating presidential descendants are: Susan Ford Bales, daughter of Gerald Ford, 38th President of the United States; Clifton Truman Daniel, grandson of Harry S. Truman, the 33rd U.S. President; Mary Jean Eisenhower, granddaughter of 34th U.S. President General Dwight D. Eisenhower; Massee McKinley, great-great grandson of 22nd and 24th U.S. President Grover Cleveland, and great-great nephew of 25th U.S. President William McKinley; and Patricia Taft, great-granddaughter of William Howard Taft, the 27th U.S. President.\n\nForum tickets are $40 each for Harry S. Truman Foundation members, $60 for non-members. The Forum begins at 4:30pm, with doors and cash bar opening at 4:00pm. Following the Forum, winners of the inaugural Monroe County student essay competition will be announced, after which attendees can mingle and enjoy cocktails on the lawn.\n\nAt 5:00pm Sunday, February 19 and Monday, February 20, Clifton Truman Daniel, grandson of Harry S. Truman, will take the stage in a live performance of the acclaimed long-running stage production, “Give ‘Em Hell, Harry!” Truman Daniel is the first direct descendant to portray a presidential ancestor in a production of this kind, and both a scheduled and a popular-demand encore performance of the one-man show sold out last year. Seating is arranged at 2-top and 4-top bistro tables: 2-tops are $80 for Society members, $120 for non-members; 4-tops are $160 for members, $240 for non-members.\n\nOn Monday, February 20, the Little White House grounds will provide the setting for a family-friendly Presidents’ Day cookout with hamburgers, veggie burgers, and hotdogs available for purchase. A cash bar will also be available, and attendees are welcome to bring a picnic blanket for the lunchtime event.\n\nThe annual “Presidential Families Weekend and Forum” is the largest Presidents’ Day Weekend gathering of presidential descendants in the country. Traditionally hosted solely by The Key West Harry S. Truman Foundation, in 2022 the Foundation partnered for the first time with the recently founded Society of Presidential Descendants, a membership organization for individuals with direct lineage to one or more of the forty-six United States Presidents.\n\nAll events are to take place on the grounds of the Harry S. Truman Little White House, 111 Front Street, Key West, Florida. Other weekend offerings include guided tours of the Historic Little White House, self-guided botanical lawn tours, and ancillary cocktail parties.
