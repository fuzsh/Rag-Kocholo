Little known fact: Most of the major east-west streets in the Valley are in alphabetical order going north to south: Chatsworth - Devonshire - Lassen - Nordhoff - Parthenia - Roscoe - Saticoy - Sherman Way - Vanowen - Victory\n\nWhat follows are the name origins of some of the Valley's most prominent streets:\n\nAMESTOY AVENUE:Â Was named after Domingo Amestoy, one of the largest wool producers in Southern California.Â In 1889 he acquired all 4,500 acres of Rancho Los Encinos in the San Fernando Valley.Â Louise Avenue was named after Louise Amestoy, a daughter of Domingo and Marie Amestoy.\n\nANDASOL AVENUE:Â It is believed to be a derivation of the Spanish term for a sun walk.Â Its first segment was paved in Granada Hills between Mayerling and Kalisher streets in 1926.\n\nBALBOA BOULEVARD: -Named for Vasco Nunez de Balboa, said to be the first European to see the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBARHAM BOULEVARD:Â Was named for Frank Barham, a newspaper magnate and L.A. booster who donated the land that later became Barham Boulevard.Â He was partners in a publishing business with William Randolph Hearst (The Herald Examiner).\n\nBASSETT STREET:Â Named for original property owner Theophilia E.

The first Southern Californians likely blazed a foot-trail millennia ago, and by the late 18th century the villagers of Cabueg-na or Kaweenga (the origin of the name \"Cahuenga\") near Universal Studios regularly trekked through the pass. In 1852, a steep wagon road replaced the old trail, and in 1911 the Pacific Electric stretched its interurban railway tracks through the pass. Any remnants of the pass' rustic character vanished in 1940, when the Cahuenga Pass Freeway -- one of L.A.'s first â opened.\n\nCHANDLER BOULEVARD: Â Was originally a leg of Sherman Way, it was renamed for land developer and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler.

In San Francisco, he met the love of his life: Bess Hesby. In 1915, she was crowned the Queen of the Pan Pacific Exposition.\n\nTheir honeymoon cabin in the redwoods of Humboldt County became the Hartsook Inn, where Mary Pickford, Bing Crosby and other luminaries were among the visitors.
