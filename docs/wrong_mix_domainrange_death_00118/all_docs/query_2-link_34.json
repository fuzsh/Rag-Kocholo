The third installment in an annual series reflecting on the contributions of women on the world stage, The Confidante, brings to life the untold story of an American heroine, Anna Rosenberg. Learn more about this event here.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhen Harry Met Pablo: Truman, Picasso, and the Cold War Politics of Modern Art\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\nAuthor Matthew Algeo retraces the Trumans’ 1958 Mediterranean vacation and visited the places they went with Picasso, including Picasso’s villa, Picasso’s ceramics studio in Vallauris, and Château Grimaldi, a museum in Antibes. A rigorous history with a heartwarming center, When Harry Met Pablo intertwines the biographies of Truman and Picasso, the history of modern art, and twentieth-century American politics, but at its core it is the touching story of two old men who meet for the first time and realize they have more in common—and are more alike—than they ever imagined.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nDewey Defeats Truman: The 1948 Election and the Battle for America’s Soul\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nOn November 2, 1948, a politically divided nation went to the polls to elect a president, but the outcome was all but certain: Thomas Dewey was going to trounce Harry Truman. Now, on the 75th anniversary of that great upset, author A.J. Baime joins us for a livestream event focused on one of the greatest election stories of all times, in which Truman mounted a history-making comeback and staked a claim for a new course for America.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nThe Watchdog: How the Truman Committee Battled Corruption and Helped Win World War Two\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nMonths before Pearl Harbor, FDR knew that the U.S. was on the verge of entering another world war for which it was dangerously ill-prepared. The urgent times demanded a transformation of the economy, with the government bankrolling the unfathomably expensive task of enlisting millions of citizens while also producing the equipment necessary to successfully fight—all of which opened up opportunities for graft, fraud and corruption. In The Watchdog, Steve Drummond—an award-winning senior editor and executive producer at NPR—draws the reader into the fast-paced story of how Harry Truman, still a newcomer to Washington politics, cobbled together a bipartisan team of men and women that took on powerful corporate entities and the Pentagon, placing Truman in the national spotlight and paving his path to the White House. The Watchdog provides a window to a time that was far from perfect but where it was possible to root out corruption and hold those responsible to account. It shows us what can be possible if politicians are governed by the principles of their office rather than self-interest.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nTruman Book Award Winner – Christian Ostermann “Between Containment and Rollback”\n\nSeptember 20, 2023\n\nJoin us in watching the much-anticipated biennial award program honoring Between Containment and Rollback: The United States and the Cold War by Christian Ostermann, History and Public Policy Program director at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In the aftermath of World War II, American policymakers turned to the task of rebuilding Europe while keeping communism at bay. In Germany, the U.S. prioritized the political, economic, and, eventually, military integration of the fledgling Federal Republic with the West. The extraordinary success story of forging this alliance has dominated our historical understanding of the American-German relationship.\n\nMost East Germans were largely left out of the story of U.S.–German relations, who found themselves caught under Soviet control and dearly paid the price for the country’s division. Ostermann takes an international approach — drawing on recently declassified documents from American, Russian, and German archives—to write the East Germans, both the leadership and general populace, back into history.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nTruman Civil Rights Symposium\n\nJuly 26-28, 2023\n\nA National 75th Anniversary Commemoration\n\nOn July 26, 1948, with the stroke of a pen, President Harry S. Truman changed the course of American history. By signing Executive Order 9981, “Establishing the President’s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services,” he officially declared that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” His action reflected the growing realization by more and more Americans that our nation could no longer reconcile segregation with the values we had fought a war to uphold.\n\nSeventy-five years on, during a three-day public symposium in Washington, D.C., the Truman Library Institute led the national commemoration of this landmark civil rights anniversary. Already, the Truman Civil Rights Symposium has garnered more than a quarter-million video views. And yet, numbers cannot convey the spirit of the Symposium—the histories provided by expert academic panels; the deeply personal stories of military leaders, veterans and service members; the unexpected moments of reckoning, remembrance and honor; and the unforgettable opportunity to share an evening with America’s 46th president, Joe Biden.\n\nAll of these moments, all of these stories—great American stories—were recorded and are available online.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nA Free World with Unity and Purpose\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nWe are happy to make available this sold-out event at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum. Featuring world chess champion, author and master of strategy, Garry Kasparov, “A Free World with Unity and Purpose” encourages those who care about global democracy to remember the “urgent lessons of the Berlin Airlift.” The airlift was a tremendous practical achievement, as well as a potent example of individual and collective leadership and courage. With Russia’s war on Ukraine raging and China increasingly aggressive, Kasparov calls for an immediate renewal of the will shown by President Harry Truman to stand up to belligerent authoritarian regimes on every front.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nTruman and the Birth of Israel\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\nOn May 14, 1948, President Harry S. Truman recognized the new state of Israel, just 11 minutes after its founding. It was the endorsement the fledgling nation needed to legitimize its sovereignty. Seventy-five years on, Ambassador Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., visited the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum to lay a wreath on the President Truman’s tomb, tour the newly renovated museum and deliver remarks during a private ceremonial event. This recorded event also features remarks by Clifton Truman Daniel, the president’s eldest grandson.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nOut of the Archives: The Marshall Plan\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nTwo years after V-E Day, Europe lay in ruins, with its economies devastated and its people facing famine. In a commencement address at Harvard University, Secretary George Marshall called for American assistance in restoring the economic infrastructure of Europe. Western Europe responded favorably, and the Truman administration called for legislation. The resulting massive aid package – the biggest of its kind and named for Marshall – provided more than $13 billion in funding for housing, infrastructure and industry. The story of Europe’s post-WWII recovery is often told with numbers. Now, Mark Adams, education director at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum, shares the human side of the story, drawing on the Truman Library’s rich archival collection. From drawings by schoolchildren to an urn of blood-stained soil to the original audio recording of General Marshall’s Harvard commencement speech, we’ll delve into the vault for a stunning collection of artifacts and a fascinating “Out of the Archives” experience.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nCode Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II\n\nMarch 23, 2023 | Women Rising / Truman Legacy Series\n\nNew York Times bestselling author Liza Mundy captivates a live and virtual audience with her story of Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.

Ferguson, Jr. is in demand for his unparalleled experience and insights on the three crises we have experienced – health, social, justice – and what must be done to mitigate the damage as we navigate a post-COVID world. At a time when many Americans lack of confidence in the economy’s ability to respond to emerging challenges, Dr. Ferguson will focus his remarks on the future of capitalism.\n\nRoger W. Ferguson, Jr. is the recipient of the 2022 Truman Medal for Economic Policy.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nIncomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency\n\nMay 25, 2022 | Distinguished Author Event\n\nPresidential historian Mark K.

White and America’s Darkest Secret\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nFrom best-selling author A.J. Baime comes a riveting new biography. Walter F. White led two lives: one as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance and the NAACP in the early 20th century; the other as a white newspaperman who covered lynching crimes in the Deep South at the blazing height of racial violence. Born mixed race and with very fair skin and straight hair, White was able to “pass” for white. He leveraged this ambiguity as a reporter, bringing to light the darkest crimes in America and helping to plant the seeds of the civil rights movement. A.J. Baime is the New York Times bestselling author of The Accidental President: Harry S. Truman and the Four Months That Changed the World, Dewey Defeats Truman: The 1948 Election and the Battle for America’s Soul, and The Arsenal of Democracy. He is a longtime regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal and his articles have appeared in The New York Times, Popular Science, and Men’s Journal. He holds an MA in literature from NYU and currently lives in northern California. This Distinguished Author Event is part of the Truman Legacy Series “To Secure These Rights,” made possible, in part, by The Boeing Company.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nFreedom from Fear: Executive Order 9808 and Truman’s Fight for Civil Rights\n\nDecember 15, 2021\n\nIn 1946, Black WWII veterans who had risked their lives overseas returned home to another fight for freedom. In the weeks and months following V-J Day, violence against Black Americans – and veterans, in particular – soared. President Truman’s response was clear – “I shall fight to end evils like this!” – but he was frustrated both by the judicial branch and the southern Democratic bloc in Congress. Undeterred, Truman drew on the Constitution and his presidential powers to issue Executive Order 9808, creating a 16-member Presidential Committee on Civil Rights. Truman’s landmark action 75 years ago this December was the first significant federal reply to racial violence since Reconstruction. What would be the findings of the committee, and how would Harry Truman—an unlikely champion for racial equity—respond?\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhistle Stops: “Senator Truman” featuring Claire McCaskill\n\nDecember 2, 2021\n\nIn this episode of our popular Whistle Stops series, Claire McCaskill hops on board to explore Harry Truman’s evolution from the “Senator from Pendergast,” a naïve tool of gangsters, to the “Senator from Missouri” who will be featured on the front page of the New York Times and TIME magazine for his work on the Truman Committee.

Truman and MacArthur. Truman and Acheson. Truman and Eisenhower. The remarkable rise of Harry Truman from Midwestern obscurity to world-shaping power was very much a story of personal relationships. One of the most illuminating relationships in Truman’s career began long before Harry Truman went to Washington, and endured to the end of his life. Tom Veatch, a brilliant Kansas City engineer and founding partner of Black & Veatch, played a key role in Truman’s political education and gave a crucial boost to the future president when Truman needed it most.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhistle Stops: “Truman and Pendergast” featuring John Herron\n\nNovember 2, 2021\n\nTravel back in time to the “wide open” town of Kansas City, where Prohibition was rarely enforced, the mob was ascendant and urban vice was rampant. At the center of it all was political boss Tom Pendergast. Many saw Tom as a “Robin Hood” figure who secured jobs, food and clothes for the poor, but his generosity always came at a price. What, then, is Pendergast’s price when he offers Harry Truman the position of Presiding County Judge in 1926? And what tradeoffs will the principled future president be willing to make during the early days of his political career? John Herron, Director of the Kansas City Public Library, is your guest conductor for this thrilling ride!\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nWhistle Stops: “Captain Harry and World War One” featuring D.M.

In a discussion of his award-winning book, Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945-1957, Derek Leebaert debunks this myth and shares a character-driven narrative that examines the evolving relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom through the lens of pivotal policy and events from the Truman Doctrine to the Vietnam War.\n\nWINNER OF THE HARRY S.

The local chief of police savagely beat him, leaving him unconscious and permanently blind. The shocking incident made national headlines and, when the police chief was acquitted by an all-white jury, the blatant injustice would change the course of American history.

In his brief stay home, he was awarded with an honorary degree by UMKC, he held a press conference in Independence, he got a haircut from a WWI comrade, and he shopped at his old business partner Eddie Jacobson’s new menswear store.\n\nThis webinar featured Doug Richardson</strong>, Chief of Interpretations and Visitor Services at the Harry S Truman National Historic Site, sharing stories from Truman’s first visit back home to Independence as President of the United States.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nMembers Night at Home with Kate Andersen Brower\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\nTruman Library Institute members were invited to join us online for an exclusive update on the renovation taking place at the Harry S.
