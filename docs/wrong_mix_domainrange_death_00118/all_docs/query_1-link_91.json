        "text": "Assailant: Richard Lawrence\n\nMethod of attack: Pistol\n\nLocation: Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat happened: The first presidential assassination attempt took place in January 1835, when Lawrence—an unemployed house painter—hid behind a pillar near the entrance of the Capitol and fired at Jackson. The pistol misfired, and when he tried again, bystanders tackled him to the floor. Lawrence was declared insane during his trial; per the U.S. Senate, \"Lawrence was convinced that he was the rightful King of England and that 'King Andrew' alone stood in the way of his claiming his crown.\"\n\nAssailant: John Schrank\n\nMethod of attack: Pistol\n\nLocation: Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nWhat happened: Schrank attempted to kill former president Roosevelt when he was campaigning in Milwaukee. As he began to speak, Schrank shot him, and the bullet lodged in his 50-page speech and his metal eyeglasses case in his breast pocket.\n\n\"Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible,\" Roosevelt said. \"I don’t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot.\" He unbuttoned his shirt, pulling out his speech. \"It takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose! Fortunately I had my manuscript, so you see I was going to make a long speech, and there is a bullet—there is where the bullet went through—and it probably saved me from it going into my heart. The bullet is in me now, so I cannot make a very long speech, but I will try my best.\"\n\nPictured: Roosevelt smiles as he greets supporters, October 1912.\n\nAssailant: Giuseppe Zangara\n\nMethod of attack: Pistol\n\nLocation: Miami, Florida\n\nWhat happened: Three weeks before FDR's inauguration, an Italian man, Zangara, attempted to kill FDR during a speech in Miami. He got off five shots—missing Roosevelt, but killing the Mayor of Chicago, Anton Cermak, and injuring five bystanders. Zangara gave his motive to officials as hatred for \"all officials and everybody who is rich.\" He was tried for the murder of Cermak, found guilty, and executed in March.\n\nPictured: Zangara in custody following his arrest for attempting to assassinate the US President-elect during a speech in Miami, with Dade County Sheriff Dan Hardie standing behind, in Dade County, Miami, Florida.\n\nAssailants: Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola\n\nMethod of attack: Automatic weapons fired at Blair House (temporary residence of Truman at the time)\n\nLocation: Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat happened: Truman, who was staying across the street from the White House, was at home when two gunmen broke in. The president was uninjured, but a White House policeman and an assailant (Torresola) were killed in the gunfire. Callazo was arrested and sentenced to death, but Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. Collazo and Torresola were Puerto Rican pro-independence activists.\n\nPictured: Diagram view of the Blair House, scene of the attempt on President Truman's life.\n\nAssailant: Sirhan Bisara Sirhan\n\nMethod of attack: Pistol\n\nLocation: Los Angeles, California\n\nWhat happened: RFK, who was running for president, was at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after winning California's democratic primary. He was shot and killed by 24-year-old Palestinian refugee Sirhan Sirhan, who says he acted due to Kennedy's politics regarding Israel. He was sentenced to death, but that sentence was commuted to life in prison. His applications for parole over the years have been denied.\n\nPictured: Sen. Robert Francis Kennedy (D- N.Y.), his wife Ethel standing behind him, gives victory sign to huge crowd at the Ambassador Hotel. He would be killed just minutes later.\n\nAssailant: Arthur Bremer\n\nMethod of attack: Pistol\n\nLocation: Laurel, Marlyand\n\nWhat happened: While campaigning, presidential candidate George C. Wallace, then the governor of Alabama, was shot at a shopping center by Bremer. He was hit four times, including in the abdomen and the chest, and paralyzed from the waist down. Though Wallace went on to win the Maryland primary, the injuries effectively ended his campaign for president.\n\nPictured: George Wallace and his wife Cornelia hold up newspaper May 17th headline indicating Wallace's victories in the May 16th Maryland and Michigan Democratic Presidential primaries. The Governor is paralyzed from the waist down by one one of four gunshot wounds suffered May 15th while campaigning at a shopping center in Laurel, Md.\n\nAssailant: Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez\n\nMethod of attack: Semi-automatic assault rifle\n\nLocation: Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat happened: Ortega-Hernandez fired at least eight rounds into the White House before he was caught. Obama was not home at the time. Per court documents from his trial, Ortega-Hernandez \"believed the federal government was conspiring against him and that Obama is 'the devil.'\" He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for terrorism and weapons offenses.\n\nPictured: The bullet hole in the window on the residential level on the south side of the White House.\n\nOther attempts were made on Obama's life during his tenure, including , when Secret Service intercepted a pipe bomb sent to him."
