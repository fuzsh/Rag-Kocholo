Inspired by his interest in the criminal justice system and commitment to addressing its inherent disparities, he is dedicated to pursuing a career in public service that allows him to work directly with those affected by these disparities. He intends to pursue a JD focusing on criminal law and prosecutorial experience. While serving in the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and subsequently joining the Governor’s Office of Hawai'i, he developed his passion for public service and an understanding of the political process by working closely with and supporting underserved communities. After graduate school, he plans to continue his commitment to service as an Assistant United States Attorney and aspires to serve as a federal judge. In his spare time, Daniel enjoys cooking, lifting weights, and practicing jiu-jitsu (no-Gi, of course).\n\nDaniel Block\n\nDaniel is pursuing a double-major in environmental studies and American studies, with a minor in legal studies. He plans to pursue a JD/MEM from Yale, focusing on novel greenhouse gas regulations and the Clean Air Act. Currently, Daniel works as the farm and program director at Zumwalt Acres, a leading carbon-negative farm in rural Illinois that is rooted in Jewish values of justice. His role involves fostering consensus among scientists, farmers, and government agencies to equitably transition the Midwest agricultural landscape toward sustainability. Through connecting farmers to Zumwalt Acres' $5 million US Department of Agriculture Climate Smart Commodities Grant, Daniel has seen how federal policy plays a key role in the transition to a carbon-negative society. Motivated by this, he aims to push the administrative state to adopt innovative, just, and market-based regulatory solutions to climate change. Daniel also serves as the senior content editor for the Brandeis Undergraduate Law Journal, where he authored an article on gender affirming care and religious liberty, with another forthcoming on the administrative state and the major questions doctrine. Daniel is an incoming summer intern for the Honorable Judge Lee Rudofsky of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\n\nJackson Boaz\n\nJackson is completing his studies in communications, legal institutions, economics, and government. After growing up in a small town in rural Northern California, he has spent the last half-decade moving around the country working on campaigns, from city councils to presidential races and everything in between. This work has brought him to California, Iowa (three times!), Georgia, Ohio, Rhode Island, and now Washington, DC. He intends to pursue a JD, with a focus in constitutional law, and has a particular interest in democratizing the federal grantmaking process. More specifically, he is passionate about expanding access to technical assistance for small towns and rural communities that need the most support in discovering and applying for much-needed federal dollars. Jackson currently works in digital communications for Representative Adam Schiff’s campaign for the US Senate, as well as in the Congressman’s official office. Past work includes staff roles on the campaigns of US Senator Jon Ossoff, California Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, Iowa State Senator Zach Wahls (IA 13), Congresswoman Cindy Axne, and many more.

She serves as a lead tutor in Chicago's juvenile detention centers, bringing college preparatory materials to incarcerated students while developing her mentorship pedagogy. Additionally, she conducted research with the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching to center minoritized student perspectives at a predominately white institution. She remains involved with her hometown of Portland, Oregon, through work with those experiencing houselessness with Blanchet House of Hospitality, and carries that perspective to her advocacy for affordable housing with Evanston’s Connections for the Homeless. Cognizant of how education, race, and poverty operate in context with one another, Anna intends to pursue a JD with an emphasis on civil rights to uproot mass incarceration as a symptom of poverty and anti-Blackness. After studying abroad in Vietnam as the first person in her family to return since the Fall of Saigon, and interning with the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon, Anna hopes to bring a transnational lens to her legal and advocacy work and create further space for Black and Asian solidarity.\n\nGrant Dillivan\n\nGrant studies criminal justice and psychology. Their understanding of the American criminal justice system and the disproportionate imprisonment of the mentally ill have compelled them to focus on a career in correctional psychology.

His unwavering dedication serves as a beacon of hope, inspiring others to overcome obstacles and effect positive change.\n\nAlex Drahos\n\nAlex majors in international relations, political science, and urban studies as a Foundation Fellow. He is passionate about reimagining urban systems and structures to better align with human sociology, psychology, and physicality. Alex intends to pursue an MPA focused on urban innovation with the goal of leading a city in implementing equitable policies to improve livability and social connection. This interest prompted him to create a $75 million regional economic development plan with the Center for Advancing Innovation, propose civic infrastructure legislative outreach strategies for a coalition of 100 local nonprofits/governments, and advise a Georgia county commissioner on affordable housing and transportation policies. Leading teams as a University Innovation Fellow, Alex has prototyped smart city technology products, modeled urban economic impact for the National Hockey League, and designed sustainable transportation systems for Delta Airlines.

After high school, she enlisted in the US Navy as a Nuclear Machinist’s Mate and was handpicked for the initial integration of women into submarines, becoming the first enlisted nuclear-trained female submariner in the Atlantic Fleet. Aboard the USS FLORIDA (SSGN 728), she deployed three times and served as her division leading petty officer and as a sexual assault victim advocate. The challenges she and other female crewmembers faced during the integration motivated her to separate from the Navy and pivot towards a career in advocacy. Combined with her personal experiences, Desaree’s work as a legal assistant for a Judge Advocate General and her internship at a criminal defense firm sharpened her focus towards combatting human trafficking. She seeks to earn a JD with an emphasis on public interest law. Desaree is passionate about advocating for adult survivors of human trafficking by increasing awareness and victim identification, strengthening legal advocacy and support services, and developing survivor-centric policies. In her spare time, she enjoys hosting crawfish boils, making friends with the crows in her neighborhood, and cuddling her lab, Sandy, and pit bull, Ramses.\n\nRay Epstein\n\nRay is double-majoring in English (with a concentration in creative writing) and communication and social influence. She has been a committed activist organizing to prevent sexual violence since middle school, and has since become the founding president of Temple University’s chapter of It’s On Us: Student Activists Against Sexual Assault. Through a partnership between her student organization and Uber, Ray secured $350,000 in free rides for Temple students needing to escape vulnerable situations.
