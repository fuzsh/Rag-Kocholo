        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1884–1972).It was late afternoon of a warm spring day. Vice President Harry S. Truman had just finished listening to a Senate debate. He was given a telephone message. It asked him to get to the White House as soon as possible. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died at Warm Springs, Georgia. That evening, April 12, 1945, at 7:09 pm, Harry S. Truman took the oath of office as the 33rd president of the United States. When he had finished taking the oath, President Truman kissed the Bible. Later he said to several White House newspapermen: “I feel as though the moon and all the stars and all the planets have fallen upon me. Please, boys, give me your prayers. I need them very much.”\n\nThe new president faced many difficulties. The end of World War II was in sight, but American forces were still fighting in Europe and the Pacific. The people at home were supplying the needs of their own fighting men and helping their Allies at a total cost of nearly 90 billion dollars a year. An atomic bomb had been developed. It was the most powerful weapon the world had ever known. President Truman knew that he must decide whether or not to use the bomb in the war with Japan.\n\nVictory and peace brought their problems too. The new Administration faced questions of how to deal with the defeated nations and how to help newly freed peoples. It had to share in planning a world organization of nations to enforce peace. On the home front there was the gigantic task of re-establishing the nation’s peacetime economy.\n\nTruman’s Boyhood in Missouri\n\nThe man who was to guide the United States through this critical period was born May 8, 1884, at Lamar, Missouri. He was the son of John Anderson Truman, a cattle trader, and Martha Young Truman.\n\nHe was named Harry for his mother’s brother, Harry Young. He was given the middle initial “S” (but no name) for his grandfathers, Anderson Shippe Truman and Solomon Young. Truman’s great-grandmother, Nancy Tyler Holmes, was a first cousin of John Tyler, tenth president of the United States. It is interesting to know that Tyler was the first vice president to become president by succession, and Truman was the seventh. It was Tyler who insisted that the vice president should actually become the president of the United States and not just acting president when he takes the office of the chief executive.\n\nShortly after Harry’s birth, the Truman family moved to nearby Independence, Missouri, not far from Kansas City. There Harry attended grade school and high school. He wore glasses from the age of 9. This kept him from doing many things the other boys did. He preferred to spend his time reading. Mark Twain, stories of the American Civil War, and the lives of great men were his favorites. He had read the Bible through twice before he was 12. There was a small library in Independence, where young Harry spent additional hours reading histories, novels, and encyclopedias. Sometimes he took the encyclopedias home with him to read. Mathilda Brown, Truman’s high-school history teacher, said of him: “I doubt if there was a student in any high school in the country who knew more of the history of the United States than Harry did.” The smartest boy in that graduating class of 1901, however, was Charles G. Ross. Ross later became President Truman’s press secretary.\n\nDuring the summers Harry, his sister, Mary Jane, and his younger brother, John Vivian, visited their grandparents, the Solomon Youngs, on their farm at Grandview, Missouri. There they helped with the farm work, rode horses, and swam. From the age of 13 Harry took piano lessons, first in Independence and later in Kansas City. He became a good amateur pianist. Truman later said he might have become a concert pianist if he had not gone into politics. When he became president, he often played the piano to relax from the cares of office. He also accompanied his daughter, Margaret, when she sang for White House visitors. Chopin and Mozart were his favorite composers.\n\nAfter graduation from high school, Harry tried for an appointment to West Point but was rejected because of poor eyesight. Having no money to pay his way through college, he took a job in a Kansas City drugstore. At the same time, he joined the Missouri National Guard. After a brief stay in the drugstore, Truman became a clerk at the Kansas City Star. He then tried working as a timekeeper for a railroad construction gang and a clerk in a Kansas City bank. Five years after he had left high school, Truman was tired of city life. He returned to his father’s farm and worked there for the next ten years.\n\nWorld War I Service and Marriage\n\nTruman was still a farmer when the United States entered World War I. As a member of the Missouri National Guard, he was called for a short period of training at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He went overseas as a captain with the 35th Division and commanded Battery D of the 129th Field Artillery in the St-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives. After the war he was commissioned a major in the Field Artillery Reserve.\n\nOn June 28, 1919, Truman married Bess Wallace of Independence. They had been childhood sweethearts. A daughter, Mary Margaret, was born to the Trumans on February 17, 1924.\n\nAfter his marriage, Truman invested all his savings in a Kansas City haberdashery. The business was successful for two years, then failed during a depression in 1922. Truman and his business partner, Eddie Jacobson, faithfully repaid their creditors, though it took them the next 12 years to do so.\n\nBegins Political Career\n\nFollowing the failure of his haberdashery business, Truman decided to seek a job in politics. While he was in the army, Truman had been a close friend of James Pendergast, nephew of Tom Pendergast, the Democratic political boss of Kansas City. This friendship led to Truman’s appointment as overseer of highways for Jackson County. After serving one year in that office Truman was elected judge in Jackson County in 1922, again with Pendergast support. He was not required to be a lawyer to hold this job, but Truman felt that he would help his career if he studied law. So he enrolled in the Kansas City Law School and attended night classes for two years.\n\nIn 1924, the year his only child was born, Truman was defeated for reelection. “I was broke and out of a job with a family to support,” Truman later said. “But I had a lot of friends and pulled through until 1926.” That year he was elected presiding judge of the Jackson County Court. This was not a judicial job. In most states it would be called the chairman of the board of county commissioners. The job included the supervision of many county expenditures. Reelected in 1930, Truman was responsible for spending more than 60 million dollars on highway and building construction. He built a reputation for efficiency and absolute honesty in contrast to the bad reputation of many of his political associates. In 1934 Truman was selected as the Pendergast candidate for United States senator. He won the Democratic nomination in a three-man race and was elected senator from Missouri. He was reelected in 1940.\n\nThe Truman Committee\n\nWhile the United States was preparing for war, Truman recalled the stories of federal waste during World War I. From the books he had read as a boy he also remembered the work done by the famous Civil War Commission on the Conduct of the War. With these things in mind Senator Truman toured the country in his own car at his own expense to observe the progress of World War II work. The irregularities he saw during his 30,000-mile tour prompted him to ask the Senate to create the Committee Investigating the National Defense Program, commonly called the Truman Committee.\n\nThe committee probed into many agencies and industries which produced war materials. It brought to light and helped to correct many cases of mismanagement, waste, and negligence. It saved the government an estimated 15 billion dollars. Later, when 50 newspapermen voted on the ten men who had made the greatest contributions to the war effort, Truman was the only legislator on the list.\n\nFirst President from Missouri\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention in June 1944, a lively contest developed between several candidates for the vice presidential nomination. Most conspicuous were Henry Wallace, who had the support of the radical wing of the Democratic party, and James Byrnes, who represented the conservative wing. The deadlock was broken by naming Truman as the compromise candidate. Truman at first flatly refused to take the nomination. He wanted to remain in the Senate. Roosevelt was insistent, and Truman finally agreed.\n\nAs vice president, Truman had little to do with shaping America’s policies at home or abroad. Roosevelt seldom consulted with him. As a result, when Roosevelt suddenly died, Truman, as president, faced many problems. Presidential aides and others did their best to help him, and Truman learned quickly.\n\nTwo weeks after he became president, Truman learned of the top secret project to develop an atomic bomb (see Manhattan Project). On July 16, 1945, he was told a successful atom bomb test had been made at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Truman consulted with his aides to decide whether the bomb should be used against Japan. An invasion of Japan was being planned. They estimated that if the bomb worked it would save a quarter of a million American lives. Truman suggested that the United States warn Japan that, if it did not surrender, the bomb would be used. Japan refused to yield. On August 6, 1945, the atom bomb exploded over Hiroshima, shattering three fifths of the city. On August 10 Japan sued for peace.\n\nPostwar Problems\n\nDuring the early months of the Truman Administration, an international conference in San Francisco, California, had written a charter for a new peace organization, the United Nations. Truman was strongly in favor of the United States becoming a key member of this organization. He had always felt the United States had been wrong in failing to join the League of Nations after World War I. On July 28, 1945, the United States Senate approved the United Nations charter. In December 1945 the Senate and House of Representatives voted to place the United States in the United Nations.\n\nThe first crisis of the president’s Administration occurred shortly after his return from Potsdam, Germany, late in 1945. There he had conferred with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill on the treatment of Germany and on other postwar problems. At home he found nationwide strikes threatening to disrupt the orderly return to normal business. By January 1946, 1.5 million men had left their jobs in the automotive, electrical, meat, and steel industries. During April 1946, John L. Lewis led a strike of 400,000 members of the United Mine Workers. In May the railroad locomotive engineers and trainmen struck. Truman ordered government seizure of the mines and railroads. The rail strike lasted only two days. Late in May the government and the miners’ union signed a contract ending the mine strike. From June 1946 on, Truman and his Administration faced increasingly critical price and supply problems in such fields as housing, food, clothing, and automobiles. General dissatisfaction brought political disaster for the Administration in the Congressional elections on November 5, 1946. A Republican landslide swept the nation and the Republicans won control of both houses of Congress.\n\nBefore the new Congress met, Lewis ordered the United Mine Workers to strike November 21. Angered, the president gave instructions for a fight to the finish. The government obtained a federal court injunction, claiming interference with government operation of the mines. When Lewis ignored this, the Supreme Court found him guilty of contempt of court. He was fined $10,000 and his union, $700,000. Meanwhile, Lewis had called off the strike.\n\nTruman Doctrine and Marshall Plan\n\nOn December 31, 1946, President Truman declared an end to the period of World War II hostilities. Early in 1947 the British said they could not support the Greek government after March 31. Many diplomats feared that the Soviet Union would then spread its power throughout the Middle East. President Truman met the problem by asking Congress for 400 million dollars to aid Greece and Turkey. Congress appropriated the money. This policy of aid, popularly known as the Truman Doctrine, was an American challenge to Soviet ambitions throughout the world.\n\nOn June 5, Secretary of State George C. Marshall proposed an even stronger measure. His Marshall Plan would give aid to all the nations of Europe. This plan, officially called the European Recovery Program, was authorized by Congress in 1948. Six billion dollars of aid was provided for the first year of the program. The Soviet Union prevented the nations of Eastern Europe from accepting any aid, so the program was confined to the nations of Western Europe.\n\nDuring 1947 the Republican 80th Congress passed the Labor-Management Relations Act (Taft-Hartley act) over the president’s veto. At Truman’s request, Congress changed the order of succession to the office of president of the United States. Congress also replaced the former War and Navy departments with a new National Military Establishment (later called the Department of Defense). In 1948 President Truman faced a difficult year. Both political parties agreed on foreign policy, but no such accord existed on domestic issues. With a presidential election coming up, domestic questions became campaign issues. Meanwhile, the breach between the Soviet Union and the Western powers widened into a “cold war.”\n\nA Fighting Campaign Brings Victory\n\nIn June 1948 the Republicans nominated Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York for president. Many Democratic leaders tried to avoid Truman’s leadership by pressing the nomination of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower refused to be considered, and the Democrats nominated Truman. Senator Alben Barkley of Kentucky was his running mate.\n\nA group of Southern Democrats, enraged by the president’s civil rights program, revolted and held a “Dixiecrat” convention in Birmingham, Alabama. They nominated Senator J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina as the States’ Rights Democratic candidate for president. Another threat to Truman arose from the formation of a Progressive party, with Henry Wallace as its candidate for the presidency.\n\nAll political indications pointed to a Republican landslide. Truman, however, refused to believe the public opinion polls. In a one-man campaign he traveled more than 30,000 miles and made some 300 speeches. He repeatedly criticized what he called the “do-nothing Republican 80th Congress.” The election of November 2 was the most dramatic political upset in the nation’s history. Truman was the first Democratic president to be elected without the “solid South.” He won 28 states and 303 electoral votes. The Democrats also won control of Congress. Dewey carried 16 states, winning 189 electoral votes; Thurmond won 4 states and 39 electoral votes.\n\nMajor strikes in the coal, steel, and automobile industries continued to threaten the nation’s economy as President Truman’s second term began. Another problem was Communism at home. In October 1949, 11 American Communist leaders were fined and sentenced to prison terms for conspiracy against the government. Charges were soon made that there were Communists in the State Department, though a Senate subcommittee later cleared the department. In September 1950 Congress passed a strict Communist-control bill over President Truman’s veto.\n\nIn 1950 the 81st Congress enlarged the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 to admit 415,744 refugees to the United States. It also broadened the social security program and extended rent control in that year. Increased defense appropriations were made for producing the hydrogen bomb, which President Truman had ordered. The Air Force was installing a radar warning screen around the United States and Alaska.\n\nWar in Korea\n\nOn June 25, 1950, war broke out in Korea. This was a great personal blow to President Truman. He had often said he wanted more than anything else to be regarded by historians as a president who brought peace to the world. Truman ordered the United States military forces to support the United Nations “police action” in Korea. (For details of the fighting, see Korean War.) On December 16 he declared a state of national emergency to help prepare the United States for a possible “all-out” war with Communism.\n\nIn the midst of these problems an amendment was added to the Constitution—the 22nd. It limited a president to two full terms or to a total of ten years if he had served part of an unexpired term. The amendment was passed in 1947 by a Republican Congress, mostly as a reaction against Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four presidential election victories. It has been argued that this controversial amendment serves to weaken a president’s effectiveness during the second term, because the incumbent cannot run for reelection (see United States Constitution).\n\nAttempt to Assassinate Truman\n\nBetween 1948 and 1952 the White House was completely reconstructed. During most of this period the Truman family lived at Blair House, across the street from the Executive Mansion. It was while the Trumans were living there that an attempt was made to assassinate the president by two Puerto Rican terrorists, Oscar Collazo and Greselio Torresola. On Nov. 1, 1950, President Truman was upstairs taking an afternoon nap when the two armed men ran up the steps to the front door of Blair House. Armed White House police rushed to stop them, firing as they ran. In a few moments Torresola lay dead and Collazo was severely wounded. Two police officers were wounded; a third, Leslie Coffelt, was killed.\n\nPresident Truman took the attempt on his life calmly, keeping all the rest of his scheduled appointments that day and going for his customary early-morning walk the following day. He was familiar with the fact that Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley were murdered while in office and that assassins had tried to kill Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt. “A president has to expect such things,” Truman said. His would-be assassins were members of the Puerto Rican revolutionary Nationalist party determined to obtain Puerto Rican independence. Collazo was convicted of murdering Coffelt and sentenced to die in the electric chair. Truman later commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. The president had previously assured the Puerto Rican people they were free to work out their own political future.\n\nKorean Conflict Continues\n\nThe nation’s foreign policies overshadowed all other political issues in 1951. After long debate the Senate voted to send four additional Army divisions to Europe as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces. There they came under the overall Allied command of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn Korea, American and other United Nations troops were fighting a huge force of Communists—the North Korean army had Chinese “volunteers.” President Truman insisted on confining the fight to Korea. The supreme commander in the Far East, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and others wanted to strike directly at China in an effort to win a quick victory. On April 11 Truman relieved MacArthur and appointed Gen. Matthew Ridgway top commander in the Far East. MacArthur immediately returned home. He received tremendous acclaim for his heroic services in World War II and in Korea. Ridgway later became Supreme Commander, Allied Powers in Europe, when Eisenhower asked to be relieved of that post by June 1, 1952. Eisenhower then came home to seek the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nOn the home front the nation worked to rearm itself and its Allies. Before the outbreak of fighting in Korea, the United States was devoting 6 percent of its industrial production to national defense. By 1952 it had climbed to 20 percent of all production in the midst of a growing peacetime economic expansion. The cost of living, by the summer of 1951, had soared to more than 185 percent of the base average of 1935–39, and prices had climbed about 9 percent since 1950.\n\nActive Political Career Comes to a Close\n\nA big problem facing Truman in 1952 was the charge of corruption in the federal government. In the previous year Congressional investigations had turned up irregularities in several government departments. Truman instructed the attorney general’s department to weed out dishonest officials.\n\nDuring its second session the 81st Congress ratified the peace treaty with Japan and approved a “peace contract” with West Germany. To strengthen national defense, Congress appropriated more than 6 billion dollars for the second year of the Mutual Security Program and more than 46 billion dollars for the armed forces. In other legislation, Congress passed a “GI Bill of Rights” for Korean War veterans and increased social security payments.\n\nA blow to defense production in 1952 was a 54-day strike by the C.I.O. United Steelworkers. At first Truman averted the strike when he ordered the government to take over 92 steel companies. The Supreme Court ruled the action unconstitutional and the workers went out on strike at once. The dispute was finally settled with an overall wage increase.\n\nPresident Truman refused to seek reelection in 1952, and the Democratic nomination went to Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois. The candidate for the Republican party was Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nThe election campaign was one of the most vigorous in the history of the nation. President Truman himself made three whistle-stop tours in behalf of Stevenson. On November 4 Dwight Eisenhower was overwhelmingly elected.\n\nEisenhower was inaugurated president on January 20, 1953, and Harry Truman retired to his home in Independence, Missouri. When he left office, Truman said, “I have had a career from precinct to president, and I’m proud of that career.” Friends raised funds to build the Harry S. Truman Library at Independence (see presidential libraries). After his death on December 26, 1972, Harry Truman was buried in the courtyard of the library. His memoirs appeared in 1955–56. In 1959 his birthplace at Lamar was dedicated as a Missouri state shrine. In 1965 the Medicare act—government health insurance for the aged, first sponsored by Truman in 1945—was signed in the Truman Library."
