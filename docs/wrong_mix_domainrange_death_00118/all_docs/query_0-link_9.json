Parsons consist mostly of documents relating to his position as Administrative Assistant Secretary of the Treasury from 1950 to 1959. Born in Los Angeles, Parsons received his baccalaureate from the University of Southern California and master’s degree from Syracuse University. After working for a short time in Chicago as a field consultant in the Public Administration Service, Parsons began working in the Bureau of the Budget as a budget examiner in 1941. After 1950 he served as an Administrative Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. During the Truman administration Parsons was put in charge of the reorganization of the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Reorganization Act of 1949 was signed into law by President Truman on June 20, 1949. The goal was to streamline departments in the executive branch and have them perform their functions with fewer funds. The Treasury Department would oversee the reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue as well as the Bureau of Customs.\n\nThere were a number of Reorganization Plans which affected the Treasury Department. Among them were Plans Number 1-6 of 1949, Number 26 of 1950 and Number 1 of 1952. These plans changed the name and structure of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which became the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS had seventeen district offices reduced to nine, in the hope that such a change would be more economical.\n\nThe Parsons papers are organized into one series, a Chronological File. This series contains daily summaries, press releases and Treasury Department reports documenting Parsons’s activities and the day-to-day functions of the department, including the reorganization of the department, staffing, and the federal budget. Included in these daily summaries and reports are references to various reorganization plans as well as information on the openings of new Treasury Department offices in regions around the country. The daily summaries also include documentation of staffing issues, including hiring, investigations into suspected homosexuality and disloyalty to the United States, and resignations. Concerning the federal and Treasury Department budgets, the summaries document budget cuts and appropriations for various federal agencies. The summaries also include documentation of day-to-day operations such as building maintenance and meetings.\n\nMore information about William W. Parsons and the reorganization of the Treasury Department can be found at the Truman Library in the John W. Snyder Papers and in the Martin L. Friedman Papers."
