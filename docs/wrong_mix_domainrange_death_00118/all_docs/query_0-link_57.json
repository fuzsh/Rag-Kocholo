        "text": "Malibu, city and beach community in Los Angeles county, southern California, U.S. With 21 miles (34 km) of coastline, Malibu lies along the Pacific Coast Highway just west-northwest of Santa Monica. The region, originally inhabited by Chumash Indians, was visited in 1542 by the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who anchored in the lagoon west of what is now Santa Monica. Named for the ranchería settlement Umalibo, a section of a Spanish land grant called Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit, and located where the Santa Monica Mountains meet the ocean, the city is well known as a beach colony of movie and television celebrities, whose homes line an unstable escarpment above a sand spit that extends into picturesque Santa Monica Bay. Malibu’s beaches are popular spots for surfing. The city is the seat of Pepperdine University (1937). Local attractions include the J. Paul Getty Museum, which was based on the plans of an ancient Roman villa, and the Malibu Lagoon Museum, which preserves an early 20th-century mansion and serves as a showplace for tiles made by Malibu Potteries (1926–32). Malibu Creek State Park is nearby. Inc. 1991. Pop. (2000) 12,575; (2010) 12,645."
