        "text": "Today, I’ll take you on a virtual tour of the Harry Truman Presidential Library, exploring its fascinating exhibits, engaging programs, and the enduring impact of Truman’s presidency. Whether you’re a history buff or simply curious about this pivotal period in American history, join us as we delve into the rich tapestry of the Harry Truman Presidential Library.\n\nWe recently visited the Truman Presidential Library and it’s one of the most underrated things to do in Kansas City. First off, I had never been to a Presidential Library and fully expected it to be a library full of books and artifacts about Truman. I was partially correct. There were no books except in the gift shop. However, if you’re into history, this is one of the best places to visit in Kansas City. It’s a place I genuinely enjoyed visiting.\n\nI love history, but I would say my knowledge of presidents is subpar at best, especially about Harry Truman. After visiting, I realize why we love Harry S. Truman in Missouri. After all, he has a college and a lake named after him.\n\nOverall, after visiting the presidential library, I think we should be proud of what he accomplished in office. He was thrust into office as president after Franklin Roosevelt passed away in office, 43 days into his third term. What I appreciate about Truman is he understood the impact he was making on US history. This meant he kept every letter he wrote to his wife, Bess, to any foreign leader, and so on. He knew they would be artifacts and wanted to preserve them. I wonder how often presidents think about these details during their presidency?\n\nThe Harry S Truman Presidential Library starts with a brief four-minute video about Truman. Think of the highlight reel of his life. After, we start learning more about him and his wife Bess, and their upbringing. I didn’t realize how deeply rooted Harry S. Truman was in Missouri, or more specifically in Independence, Missouri. For those not familiar with the city, it’s about 20 minutes from downtown Kansas City. From a young age, he enjoyed playing the piano. and would later gift a piano to his daughter, which she hated at first.\n\nEach room of the library tells us about a different period of his life. From his time spent in local politics to how he became president. One tidbit I found fascinating was that Truman met Roosevelt twice while he was Vice President. This caused a bit of chaos when he became President because he wasn’t aware of what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nAs you explore the library you will learn about his first term as president which leads up to the election of 1948 where he runs as president. There are so many fascinating nuggets about the presidential race and the library does a great job explaining the drama. I found Truman to be relatable and simple. A great example of this is during the night of the election. He somehow managed to fall asleep before 7 pm. I\n\nSpoiler alert: Harry S Truman wins the election. However, the celebration quickly turns to turmoil. I was surprised by the amount of obstacles he dealt with during his Presidency. There are a few rooms dedicated to some of the largest issues he faced. The library has short videos throughout to help you understand the significance of what he was going through.\n\nHe decides not to run for re-election and our journey through the Presidential Library starts to wind down. A highlight is the replica of the Oval House that you walk into.\n\nYou also learn what life was like after he left the White House. Another room discusses life after his presidency. He moves back to Missouri and starts to work on his presidential library shortly after. If you go to the bottom level of the library you can see some of his vehicles, which I enjoyed learning about.\n\nI highly recommend visiting the Harry S Truman Presidential Library. It’s a great place to take kids and is the perfect event for a winter day or a hot Summer day. There are interactive and educational areas for kids to do. My daughter spent time answering questions throughout the library and tried every interactive exhibit there was. The grounds of the Presidential Library are gorgeous as well. It’s a place I can imagine having a picnic during nice weather.\n\nWe didn’t have time, but if you have extra time, Harry Truman’s house is also nearby that you can visit. It’s considered a national landmark.\n\nHave you been to a Presidential Library before? If so, which one?"
