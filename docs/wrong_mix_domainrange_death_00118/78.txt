"Well, it's good to be back home, in what I call the center of the world...Independence, Missouri. I am more than happy to be here, and to stay here the rest of my life. I hope I won't cause you much trouble while I am here!" President Harry S Truman Film courtesy the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum

#1: Visit nps.gov

When planning your visit to a National Park unit, we advise that you begin your planning experience at the National Park Service's main webpage. At www.nps.gov, you can find your local National Park unit, or find parks that you are interested in.

You may have already been there by the time you're on this page. Bravo!

You can also research special features, such as parks that have Junior Ranger programs, special events being held locally or nationally, check what fee(s) parks charge for services, safety and closure information, and more.

It's a one-stop resource that should be able to help you plan like a Park Ranger!

#2: Explore Independence and Grandview

Independence and Grandview, Missouri, are very proud of their association with President Harry S Truman, First Lady Bess Wallace Truman, their family history and legacy.

Harry S Truman once called Independence, Missouri, "the center of the world." Visiting Independence, today, is an enlightening experience. You can learn about the Trumans, some Civil War history, some historic trail history, and more. You can experience a mid-19th century jail, some beautiful historic mansions, and do some unique shopping.

In Grandview, you can imagine the once vast farm that Harry Truman's family once managed, and explore many other features that make the community a vital one today.

#4: Ask us...we're here to help!

One way to plan like a Park Ranger is to ask questions to the Park Rangers!

These folks are the best in the business. They care deeply about the resources we protect, care deeply about sharing our stories, and care deeply about you, your safety, and your experiences.

They know a lot, but don't know everything. So we will research and learn with you. We Park Rangers learn something new every day...even those of us who have studied Harry Truman for years and have been in the National Park Service for years.

We learn by studying, by researching, and by listening to you!

#5: Try the New NPS App!

The new National Park Service app can be a valuable tool, and helps you determine park operation schedules, find regular and special events, notifies you of any safety issues and closures, and more. It's available for both iOS and Android users, and is absolutely free!

When planning a visit to us, please remember to:

*Be mindful of traffic and your surroundings.

*Keep personal belongings on you secured in your locked car or trunk.

*Check the weather forecast. Sometimes we get weird weather in the Midwest.

*When exploring the grounds of the Truman Farm, be mindful of ticks and insects.

*Please listen to NPS staff and volunteers if there is a special emergency.

#7: Rangers Love the Truman Library!

So Will You! Please Visit!

#7: Visit the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum

When President Harry S Truman came home after his presidency, he began the process of developing his presidential library, intending to create a permanent repository for his papers and a place of learning for citizens.

The Truman Library recently opened a brand new museum experience that gives a perfect understanding of why his administration helped create the world in which we live today.

And the Research Room is a place where you can examine the presidential and personal papers of the 33rd President of the United States. They belong to the American people. That's the way Truman wanted it.

#8: Take the National Park Service Wellness Challenge!

Will you match Trumanâ€™s 120 steps per minute walking pace as you follow his daily routes in Independence, Missouri? Will you get butterflies as you learn about the courtship letters he sent to his wife? Will you consider the choices he made and how they guided our nation through uncertain times? Personal wellness is out there waiting for you. And, it is well within reach.

Try the National Park Service Wellness Challenge while visiting us! And try it at our fellow National Park Service sites in Missouri.
