Over the course of five\ntrips, Junger was in more firefights than he could count, as men he knew\nwere killed or wounded and he himself was almost killed. His relationship\nwith these soldiers grew so close that they considered him part of the\nplatoon, and he enjoyed an access and a candidness that few, if any,\njournalists ever attain.This lecture contains discussion of adult content.",
