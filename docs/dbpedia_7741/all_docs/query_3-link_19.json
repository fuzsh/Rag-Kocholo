        "text": "Sebastian Junger is a journalist, author, and documentarian. Most of his work centers around his time from being embedded in warzones. He’s a fascinating person and is now on the Joe Rogan Experience for his fourth appearance, discussing his recent book, In My Time of Dying: How I Came Face to Face with the Idea of an Afterlife.\n\nAir Date: July 2, 2024\n\nThe episode opens with Sebastian explaining how he gets by with his flip phone. He reveals that he often travels without a charger since his phone’s battery lasts so long. Quite tempting. This topic leads to a discussion about the effect technology has on being an attentive parent and raising children (3:50). I personally find it endearing when Joe talks about having daughters and how much it’s taught him. The conversation about child rearing and relationships leads Joe and Sebastian to consider the effects of mental health issues, including Bipolar Disorder and depression (11:40).\n\nAt 23:53, Rogan asks Junger to give his thoughts on the trajectory of war within humanity and if the world will ever be free of conflict. Junger’s knowledge and experience allow him to give insight into the cost of war and the associated psychology that often gets overlooked in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAt 32:32, Joe asks Sebastian about the near-death experience that is written about in his new book. In 2020, Sebastian had an aneurysm in his abdomen that almost cost him his life. He engages in an amazing telling of the story that led to him almost bleeding out during the hour-long drive to the hospital. He was estimated to have lost 2/3rds of his blood before arriving at the emergency room. During this experience, Despite Sebastian’s spiritual beliefs, or lack thereof, he says he felt the presence of his deceased father and an abyss that was drawing him in. Ultimately, his biggest ask is that people consider donating blood more often.\n\nThe story is indeed fascinating but its telling prompted Joe to key in on the aspect of spirituality, so he asks Sebastian what atheism means to him (52:57). Although Sebastian appears to be touched by the experience he had, he still feels comfortable in the determination that what he saw and felt was the result of an overactive brain during a moment of high stress. To add to his position, he includes the post-trauma he experienced in the days following the event, which included nightmares, dread of mortality, and a feeling that he actually died that day and his subsequent experiences were that of a supernatural nature. Sebastian used research to help assist with his anxiety and trauma and found that there is a conversation to be had about life after death that may exist at a quantum level, beyond current human understanding. Without direct contradiction, Joe gives his impression of spirituality, the existence of souls, and his poor experiences with religion while he was growing up (1:31:43). While highlighting his experiences, Joe gets a bit emotional remembering how his grandparents lived in their final days and the circumstances they had to endure."
