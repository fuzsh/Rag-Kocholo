        "text": "About the Author\n\nJunger has spent most of his life as a journalist with people in extreme, dangerous professions. His best-known book is The Perfect Storm, the bestseller about fishermen caught in a 100-year storm in the Atlantic. I first read Fire, a collection of his writing, in 2007, and War, in which he embedded with an Army platoon in the Korangal Valley in Afghanistan, in 2010 (he also made the award-winning documentary, Restrepo, about that experience).\n\nWhat’s the book about\n\nTribe is about soldiers after war, about what their combat experience provides them that their home experience might lack.\n\nIt’s hard to generalize the experience of war or to consider the “benefits” of combat experience, but there is ample evidence to suggest that for many soldiers, it provides a deep sense of community and communal purpose. War—and combat specifically—binds groups of people in an existential struggle, against a common enemy or, at the very least, for their own survival.\n\nThis daily fight for survival is largely absent from our modern lives, and Junger argues that there is a downside to that. We lose tribal cohesion. “The beauty and tragedy of the modern world is that it eliminates many situations that require people to demonstrate a commitment to the collective good.”\n\nModern life has many benefits, but it also makes it difficult to attain the things humans actually need. The qualities we elevate—affluence, beauty, and status—are not correlated with happiness as we might suppose. What we actually need is to feel competent, authentic and connected. We need community and purpose, but we reduce the role of both and elevate the role of authority and hierarchy, often seeing our place in the world in relation to others, comparing our ranks or social status or resumes.\n\nTribes have a sense of equality. While there may be a leader, the tribe exists for the individuals, a commitment as strong as the individual’s commitment to the collective. Food is not just shared in the ritual of mealtime, but it is shared as a common possession—no single person will go hungry alone. Nobody will be left behind.\n\nIt’s counterintuitive to think of a military unit this way. We typically think of the military as defined by rank. But for a unit in the heat of combat, while the roles might be critical, there is no special benefit afforded to a higher rank. Especially in the kind of combat Junger covered—a group of soldiers under fire in the mountains of Afghanistan.\n\nAnd when Junger applies the term “tribe,” he is using the more primitive sense of the word. People with common interests or passions—Boston Red Sox fans, magicians, LARPers—are not tribes. There needs to be more than a common interest. The bonds of a true tribe are welded with the heat of an existential threat.\n\nThus, it’s often in moments of catastrophe that tribal behavior emerges. People struggling for survival after an earthquake, like soldiers dug into a hillside, often display tribal behaviors and improvised social structures that tend to be more egalitarian.\n\nThe oft-noted but little-understood irony is that many people, once they have survived these harrowing, life-threatening situations, actually crave certain aspects of them. A part of them wants to return to war, or strangely misses something about the moment of disaster. It is a paradox that they often struggle to understand, because the moment they crave was often one of great loss or trauma as well.\n\nJunger focuses on the experience of soldiers, including the aftermath of combat, the difficulties of accurately diagnosing and coping with PTSD, and other related issues. He wanders off for a few pages of fist-shaking against modern values, political polarization, etc. And he over-romanticizes pre-American tribal life, focusing only on the elements that created coherent tribes and none of the downsides. But both of these criticisms are minor, as his real goal is to understand why we can’t, in a modern, peaceful society, deliver on these core human needs. What are we missing in our cultural values and structures?\n\n“Acting in a tribal way simply means being willing to make a substantive sacrifice for your community,” Junger writes. He asks why we feel less obligated to do that in our day-to-day lives.\n\nTribe is meditative than Junger’s other books, which ask big questions but lean more toward journalism. It asks provocative ideas about community and purpose, if it feels short on answers.\n\nBut I also couldn’t help but think about the application to political tribalism. Specifically the difference between an interest group (e.g. Boston Red Sox fans, people who want lower taxes) and a tribe, as Junger defines it. When you consider that a tribe is united not just by common interest but by existential threat, the role that fear plays becomes apparent.\n\nThis is the dark side of the tribal mentality. Yes, sacrificing for the common good sounds noble, but where we draw the lines around “common” matters. If I tell you that the other team isn’t just an opponent but The Enemy, that they are out to destroy us and our way of life (existential threat) and thus our common goal is to destroy them first (uniting purpose), then we have a tribe. But we have the element of tribalism that Junger leaves out of his idealized depiction of pre-American life, which included (among all its virtues) war and violence between the tribes.\n\nThe allure of a tribe is clear. A tribe gives us purpose, community and identity. Yes, it can be a beneficial side-effect of war, as in the cohesion of a military unit in combat. But if we weaponize fear, fuel it with the histrionics of the media and the politicians, and elevate everything to an existential threat from some Other group, then the “tribal ideal” can also be a fulcrum for war."
