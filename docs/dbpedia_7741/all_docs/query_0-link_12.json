        "text": "âAs someone who spends a lot of time thinking about loss and death and grief, I found this book extraordinary.â\n\nâAnderson Cooper\n\nâLet me start this way: I believe that Sebastian Junger is one of the finest writers of our generation. In My Time of Dying is a stunning book about life, about death, about the afterlife. These are subjects all of us should want to spend days, months, years thinking about. But we donât do that. Why? Probably because the subject overwhelms most of us. And maybe because the human condition scares the hell out of all of us. Well, Sebastian Junger has just done the hard work for us. In My Time of Dying examines the often subtle connections between life, death, and the after-life. Junger has clearly obsessed about his subject. The result is a powerful book that comes as close as anything Iâve read in explaining what it means to be human.â\n\nâJames Patterson\n\nâSebastian Junger is known for standing on the front lines in places that scare the hell out of the rest of us. Nowhere is that truer than in In My Time of Dying, where he turns inward to examine his own mortality, the most frighteningâyet fascinatingâfrontier there is.â\n\nâCaitlin Doughty, New York Times bestselling author of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes & Other Lessons from the Crematory\n\nâSebastian Junger, a virtuoso of narrative nonfiction, has conjured his most personal and yet universal book, a stunning account I didnât so much read as inhale, awed and riveted and forever changed.â\n\nâMichael Finkel, New York Times bestselling author of The Art Thief\n\n\"In books like The Perfect Storm and War, Sebastian Junger transported readers to perilous worlds most would never actually visit for themselves. Now, with this tour de force, Junger takes his readers on a more personal journey and to a far more ordinary placeâa place where, at one moment, we might be clearing brush at a country cabin and spending a quiet moment with our partner and, at the next, bleeding to death in the back of an ambulance from an invisible wound. Having come within mere minutes of not surviving a ruptured pancreatic artery, Junger has returned to masterfully braid together a discussion of family, near-death experiences, quantum physics, and the miracle of modern medicine. With this soon-to-be classic, Junger has crafted an ode to the magical healing power of love and the wonder of life.â\n\nâDavid R. Dow, National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and author of Things Iâve Learned from Dying: A Book About Life\n\nâIn My Time of Dying is written by one of our greatest reporters, who found himself at the brink of death and came back with the story of his lifeâand ours. Combining elements of a heart-pounding medical thriller with brilliantly clear science-writing, Sebastian Junger has written a tour-de-force about the biggest mystery we all face. With stories from war, medicine, history, and everyday life woven throughout, this is an instant classic that filled me with wonder, gratitude, and awe. It belongs in the company of Atul Guwandeâs Being Mortal and Sherwin Nulandâs How We Die, but goes one step further, helping us imagine what if anything might await us on the other side of the great divide.â\n\nâWill Schwalbe, New York Times bestselling author of The End of Your Life Book Club\n\nâA terrifically detailed medical thriller, as suspenseful and pacy as an episode of peak-era ER.â\n\nâSimon Usborne, The Guardian\n\nâExtraordinaryâ¦what Junger has given us is perhaps the first of its kind: a report by a journalist about his own deathâ\n\nâRyan DâAgostino, Menâs Health\n\n\"Written with Jungerâs usual combination of intelligent reporting and flashes of poetry, this riveting, inspiring volume is an intimate and powerful work sure to prompt reflections in anyone who reads it.\"\n\nâMichael Hainey, Air Mail\n\nâBraids a journalistâs best efforts at answers with a sexagenarianâs complicated acceptance of the inevitable.â\n\nâElisabeth Egan, The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Can we prove an afterlife exists? No. Might one exist? Junger gives us reason to believe in that possibility. In any case, how lucky we are that Junger survived, and that weâre able to join him on another mind-blowing adventureâthis time to a place all of us will one day visit.\"\n\nâSteven Petrow, The Washington Post\n\nâNothing short of wonderful and stimulating.â\n\nâPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nâA riveting and resonant meditation on some of lifeâs biggest questions.â\n\nâPublishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n\"Few other writers have such passion for granular detail, intellectual heft and boundless curiosity...For all Jungerâs firework display of ideas, this is an oddly reassuring book, especially for those lacking the consolation of religious belief.\"\n\nâJanice Turner, The Times (UK)\n\n\"Ardently researched, consummately written, and boldly forthright, this an intensely moving and deeply provocative immersion.â\n\nâBooklist (starred review)\n\nâA luminous bookâ¦Intelligent and poignantly probing.â\n\nâKirkus Reviews\n\nâHauntingâ¦Junger brings the meticulousness of his earlier career to this most personal event.â\n\nâErica Wagner, The New Statesman\n\nâJungerâs book is excellent at jolting us out of a complacent attitude towards death. Partly because it recounts how suddenly a seemingly healthy adultâa strong, fit, and worldly-wise manâcan find himself laid low by an almost fatal illness or injury.\"\n\nâAyaan Hirsi Ali, National Review\n\nâAn impressive mix of faith, science, and reason that charts the marvels of the universe and the place in it we have attained against all logical odds.â\n\nâJerod Ra'Del Hollyfield, The Pamphleteer (Nashville)"
