        "text": "Conversations in The Last Patrol\n\nOpening night at the museum was spectacular, with hundreds of people filling the Lefrak Theater at the museum on Manhattan’s West Side. It turned out that Junger and I were joined onstage by Brendan, the combat vet, and Guillermo, the photographer. That made the conversation seem too short, although we did get the chance to touch on some tough topics, such as the affective experience of war and its aftermaths, and what’s wrong with the United States. It was also an opportunity to learn more about the three men and their lives. Afterwards, I picked up some chatter. The reviews were mixed: some appreciated the openness and honesty of the men in the film; others found their bluntness off-putting.\n\nIn my view, The Last Patrol is a moving, disturbing, enlightening, funny, enraging and ultimately a very sad commentary on the state of the nation and the world, which is what I shared with Junger on stage at the opening night of the Mead Festival. In the film, war comes across as perhaps the most viable of alternatives for some kind of “fulfilling” life, especially for those who may dread the dim prospects the future seems to hold. It also provides one of the few avenues through which they can receive affirmation and appreciation from others. In an essay that serves as a powerful complement to The Last Patrol, Fanning calls this kind of affirmation “blind celebration” (5).\n\nIn the film, Junger says The Last Patrol is a “300-mile conversation about war, about what it does to you, how it changes you, how you miss it, and how it’s hard to re-enter society.” There are also some deep silences in this film. On stage, I got to ask about one of the silences: “War does a great job of setting up binaries—the good guys and the bad guys,” I said. “In your conversation across America, did you ever talk about ‘the enemy,’ who they are, why you are fighting them, why the United States is in Afghanistan in the first place?”"
