Sebastian Junger has made a specialty of bringing to life the drama of nature and human nature. Few writers have been to so many disparate and desperate corners of the globe. Fewer still have met the standard of great journalism more consistently. None has provided more starkly memorable evocations of extreme events. From the murderous mechanics of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone, to an inferno forest fire burning out of control in the steep canyons of Idaho, to the forensics of genocide in Kosovo, this collection of Junger’s reporting will take readers to places they need to know about but wouldn’t dream of going on their own. In his company we travel to these places, pass through frightening checkpoints, actual and psychological, and come face to face with the truth.\n\nA Death in Belmont\n\nA fatal collision of three lives in the most intriguing and original crime story since In Cold Blood. In the spring of 1963, the quiet suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, is rocked by a shocking sex murder that exactly fits the pattern of the Boston Strangler. Sensing a break in the case that has paralyzed the city of Boston, the police track down a black man, Roy Smith, who cleaned the victim’s house that day and left a receipt with his name on the kitchen counter. Smith is hastily convicted of the Belmont murder, but the terror of the Strangler continues. On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo the man who would eventually confess in lurid detail to the Strangler’s crimes is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter at the Jungers’ home. In this spare, powerful narrative, Sebastian Junger chronicles three lives that collide and ultimately are destroyed in the vortex of one of the first and most controversial serial murder cases in America.\n\nWar\n\nIn his breakout bestseller, The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger created ‘a wild ride that brilliantly captures the awesome power of the raging sea and the often futile attempts of humans to withstand it’ Los Angeles Times Book Review. Now, Junger turns his brilliant and empathetic eye to the reality of combat the fear, the honor, and the trust among men in an extreme situation whose survival depends on their absolute commitment to one another. His on the ground account follows a single platoon through a 15 month tour of duty in the most dangerous outpost in Afghanistan’s Korengal Valley. Through the experiences of these young men at war, he shows what it means to fight, to serve, and to face down mortal danger on a daily basis.\n\nWild Stories\n\nFor the past decade, Men’s Journal has set the standard for travel and adventure writing by publishing the work of America s finest authors and literary journalists. Wild Stories collects thirty two of the best pieces to appear in the magazine, written by its most esteemed contributors, including Jim Harrison, Sebastian Junger, P. J. O Rourke, Rick Bass, Thomas McGuane, George Plimpton, Hampton Sides, Doug Stanton, Tim Cahill, and Mark Bowden.\n\nEach of the four chapters in Wild Stories showcases Men s Journal s diversity and taut storytelling power. The Adventures is a series of razor sharp travel narratives, from a road trip across India on the perilous Grand Trunk Road to a search for grizzlies in Romania. The Sporting Life is a look into obscure corners of the sports world, where golf s bush league wannabes try to make it to the PGA and a group of cyclists out suffer one another in pursuit of the mythic Hour Record. Men s Lives includes profiles of singular adventurers such as Yvon Chouinard and Ned Gillette, and captures the rewards of such quintessentially male traditions as building a cabin on your own plot of land. And The Reporting collects definitive accounts of the most newsworthy disasters, as well as riveting dispatches from war zones in Somalia, Sudan, and Colombia, and from environmental hot spots in Alaska and Montana.\n\nCommemorating Men s Journal s tenth anniversary, Wild Stories is a diverse and entertaining anthology that explores the magazine s basic creed: Life is an adventure. From the first page to the last, these are stories you ll never forget."
