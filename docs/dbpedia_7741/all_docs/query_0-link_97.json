Then managed to snatch away anyone’s self worth, all of these things leaving them being in a constant state of unease. For instance, “There is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and the air of the streets. Fear walks through the city, fear without name, without shape.\n\n“The laws say that none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for this is the great transgression and the root of all evil” (17). The citizens were forbidden from ever being alone or in peace and quiet. Infants were raised together up until the age of five in the Home of Infants, they then went to school together for ten years in the Home of the Students, they then were assigned jobs to work until they were forty, where they were with the same people at all times, and then they were sent to the Home of the Useless until their untimely death (20, 28). Forced to be together, all they know their entire lives is collectivism. They are one and they will always be one, until their\n\nSebastian Junger's Tribe: On Homecoming And Belonging\n\n1888 Words | 8 Pages\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder is typically used to categorize Veterans. The common population neglects to submit survivors of sexual abuse in their childhood in the term of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD. Rather these survivors ridden with trauma from their abuse are swept under the carpet and kept out of conversation. It is as if that one assumes if they don’t talk about these transgressions, they will cease to exist altogether. In Sebastian Junger’s Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging, he provocatively insists to categorize individuals into communities.\n\nHe describes community so perfectly in his essay while telling his story of the flood, “the people who lived here were not the only ones who helped out. People drove here from all over the country to cook food and donate supplies.” (Kohl 113). I love that he included the fact that people that did not belong to his actual community still came together to form an entire new community to help one another and rebuild. Kohl describes his community as amazing because of how many people from all over had already filled up shelters with supplies and helped other rebuild their homes.\n\n\"Seemed like a kid who was looking for something, looking for something, just didn't know what it was\" (Krakauer 42). As an individual Chris McCandless was looking for himself. In the non-fiction book Into The Wild written by Jon Krakauer, it talks about the spiritual journey Chris made to the Alaskan wilderness, alone. There comes a time in everyones lives when a person realizes the satisfaction in ones life is mediocre, when that person realizes they want something more. The community Chris was raised in often set guidelines that limited his freedom.\n\nInto The Wild, By Jon Krakauer\n\n755 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn Into the Wild, John Krakauer, shows through the character of Alex McCandless that community is not essential to happiness, through the actions he does in the book. A community is a group of people in the same area or sharing the same characteristics. And Alex McCandless proves community is not essential to happiness by introducing the relationships he makes along the way and learning more about him. Alex gets uncomfortable with human intimacy and making friendships, showing it’s not essential. “McCandless was thrilled to be on his way north, and he was relieved as well- relieved that he had again evaded the impending threat of human intimacy, of friendship, and all the messy emotional baggage that comes along with it (55).”\n\nCapital Cities At War: A Literary Analysis\n\n610 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn the reading Paris, London, and Berlin 1914-1919: Capital Cities at War, Jay Winter compares Paris, London, and Berlin during the Great War. To better understand the experiences of people during World War I, Jay Winter advocates understanding the community of life in wartime and analyzing how the war distorted the way in which ordinary people went about their lives. In this context the community is a social and geographic entity around which ordinary people construct their daily lives. The city is in the middle of the experienced community and the imagined community. There is a tendency to evaluate the effects of the war based on the economic view of the standard of living, however, well-being is a more encompassing term because it includes agency achieved, personal well-being and economic well-being.\n\nThe Role Of Conformity In The Chrysalids\n\n982 Words | 4 Pages\n\nEvery person has something to contribute to society, regardless of age, sex or culture. The measurement of a person’s worth is determined by more than simply following rules and going through the motions. Accordingly, the combined contribution to society is more than the sum of each person. However, in The Chrysalids, by John Wyndham, the people of Waknuk live a life governed by strict social norms, which limits their expression of individuality. This pervasive attitude results in a narrow-minded perspective on what it means to be human.\n\nSocial Interaction In Where The Crawdads Sing\n\n1388 Words | 6 Pages\n\nA tide she knew well” (Owens 143).

As nations around the world expanded and grew, people and nations banded together creating communities (can also be noted as cities, urban living, towns, and such).
