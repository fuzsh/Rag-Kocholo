        "text": "Twenty years ago today, Sebastian Junger was watching 30-foot waves destroy waterfront homes as the \"Halloween nor'easter\" churned up the coast.\n\nJunger, then 29, was living in Gloucester, working as a tree climber with landscaping crews.\n\n\"I was a floundering, possibly failing, freelance writer,\" he recalled Saturday from the cozy warmth of his restored antique home in the Truro woods.\n\nHurricane Bob had walloped the Cape only two months earlier. Junger had been busy trimming trees on the Cape when he accidentally cut his leg with a chain saw.\n\n\"It got me thinking about dangerous jobs,\" he said. \"And then this storm hit Gloucester. My girlfriend and I watched 30-foot waves roll in and destroy fancy homes on the shore. It was an incredible scene.\"\n\nThe next day they heard the 70-foot swordfish boat Andrea Gail and its crew of six had been lost at sea. Buoy readings from the area of the Andrea Gail's possible final location indicated waves spiked to 100 feet.\n\n\"That was so dramatic,\" he said. \"It sounded like a good chapter for the book.\"\n\nJunger wrote that chapter, sent it to his literary agent in New York City, then headed west to write about fire jumpers.\n\nNext he went to Bosnia to either \"write about war correspondents or be one myself,\" he said.\n\nWhile in Bosnia, he got a fax from his agent: W.W. Norton & Co., an independent publishing house whose authors include best-sellers Patrick O'Brian, Paul Krugman and Michael Lewis, liked the sample chapter and offered to pay him a $35,000 advance to turn it into a book.\n\nThe money was supposed to last a year.\n\nBut \"The Perfect Storm\" took Junger two years to write. With resources dwindling, he kept at it, sometimes with minimal heat in his parents' summer home in Truro. It got so cold at times that the olive oil in the kitchen froze into a cloudy glob in the jar and Junger could see his breath as he wrote.\n\nWithin months of turning in the finished book, however, it became clear Junger would not have to worry about heating expenses again.\n\nThe positive reviews were overwhelming. Soon, Junger was inundated with interviews and speaking engagements.\n\nThe book spent 189 weeks on The New York Times hardcover and paperback best-seller lists and sparked a renewed interest in nonfiction stories. \"The Perfect Storm\" was made into a Hollywood blockbuster starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. And Junger, who followed up with \"Fire,\" about his smoke-jumper experiences, became known as \"the author of the best-selling 'The Perfect Storm.'\"\n\nJunger, now 49, has moved on from the shores of New England to the mountains of Afghanistan, where he became a well-known war correspondent with his book \"War,\" another Times best-seller. Junger is also a documentary filmmaker, who created the Oscar-nominated \"Restrepo\" with the late photojournalist Tim Hetherington. Both the book and documentary chronicle the experiences of a platoon from the 173rd Airborne Brigade on a 15-month deployment in 2007-2008 to the Korengal Valley, one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan at the time.\n\nIn many ways, Junger continues to write about the same characters he came to know in Gloucester.\n\n\"Tough young males,\" he said. \"Some in the position because they feel they don't have other good options. Some are looking for adventure. Some are looking to test themselves and some do it because their dad did it, and they are proud of it.\"\n\n\"The Perfect Storm\" allowed Junger to live his dream to become a war correspondent.\n\nHis life's work of writing about dangerous jobs took a drastic turn this April, however, when his friend, Hetherington, was killed at the age of 40 while photographing the conflict in Libya.\n\nUntil then, Junger willingly put himself in danger, similar to fishermen and soldiers.\n\nBut with Hetherington's death, he got too close.\n\n\"I suffered so much sorrow and grief,\" Junger said. \"I didn't want to do that to the people I cared about.\n\n\"I immediately had a talk with Daniela (his wife) and I got out.\"\n\nJunger is now working on a documentary about Hetherington for HBO.\n\nAnd he's trying to start up a free three-day course, called Reporters Instructed in Saving Colleagues, to train war correspondents in battlefield medicine.\n\nHetherington bled to death, but the injury wasn't a mortal wound, Junger said. He could have been saved.\n\n\"I want to make it so no one hires a freelance journalist (to cover war) without it,\" he said.\n\nAs another nor'easter arrived this Halloween weekend, Junger, who set up The Perfect Storm Foundation to help children of fishing families, reflected on the fishermen who risk their lives and set out to the dangerous North Atlantic.\n\n\"It costs a lot to run a boat and guys are constantly weighing the risk of bad weather with the need to pull in fish. It's a dangerous job ... it just is.\""
