        "text": "This week on the Next Big Idea podcast, our producer Caleb Bissinger talks with Sebastian Junger about what it was like to almost die ... and come back, detailed in Sebastian's latest bestseller, In My Time of Dying. Listen on Apple or Spotify, and let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nOn a June night a few years ago, Sebastian Junger — bestselling author of The Perfect Storm and co-director of the Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo — lay on an operating table, dying.\n\n“The doctor asked permission to put a large gauge needle through my neck into my jugular to transfuse me,” Sebastian told me when we spoke earlier this month. “And it didn't sound very pleasant. I said, ‘You mean in case there's an emergency?’ And he said, ‘This is the emergency right now.’”\n\nWhat Sebastian didn’t realize — what the doctor didn’t yet know — was that an undiagnosed aneurysm in his pancreatic artery had ruptured and was now spewing blood into his abdomen. He was losing a pint of blood roughly every 10 minutes. And there are only 12 pints of blood in the human body. Sebastian, as he puts it, was “a human hourglass.”\n\n“So [the doctor] started working on my neck,” Sebastian recalls, “and as he was doing that, I became aware of this black pit that opened up underneath me. It was infinitely black and infinitely large. It was everything and nothing. And it was pulling me into it. And I kind of knew, in this sort of animal knowledge, that if you go into the infinitely black pit, you're not coming out.”\n\nSebastian started to panic. And then he saw something else: his dead father. “He was radiating care and benevolence. He was like, ‘It's OK. You don't have to fight it. You can come with me.’ I was confused and horrified by his presence, so I said to the doctor, ‘You got to hurry. You're losing me right now. I’m going.’”\n\nAnd then he blacked out.\n\nSebastian survived his brush with death. Though “brush” doesn’t really do it justice. He lost two-thirds of the blood in his body. He came close enough to death that he could smell its “rank and foul odor.” Back home, back among the living, Sebastian didn’t feel like he had a new lease on life. Instead, he was mired in an existential funk. He questioned his own existence. He struggled to make sense of his father’s appearance. Was it just a hallucination, or could it possibly be…?\n\nHis search for answers led him to write his new book, In My Time of Dying: How I Came Face to Face with the Idea of an Afterlife. It’s a beautiful, nerve-racking, sometimes overwhelming book that manages, in fewer than 200 pages, to take readers into the hospital where doctors miraculously saved Sebastian’s life and on a whirlwind tour of quantum physics.\n\nI’m a longtime admirer of Sebastian’s work, but this book (and our conversation about it) exceeded my already high expectations. It changed the way I think about what it means to be alive. It helped me finally understand what the hell people mean when they talk about Schrödinger's cat and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle. Most of all, it left me feeling humble about my own impermanence and humble, too, about how much we still don’t understand about the nature of reality.\n\nListen to the episode now on Apple Podcasts or Spotify. And check out a few of my favorite moments below!\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nIn the book, you go back and talk to the physicians who treated you. You look at the medical logs. And you reconstruct what happened, almost minute by minute. It reminded me of what is perhaps the most famous section in The Perfect Storm where you wrote about the deaths of six men who died aboard a shipping vessel in the North Atlantic in 1991. Having written painstakingly about the deaths of others, what was it like to write about your own near death with that same level of detail and vividness?\n\nTo start with, there was an element of moral exoneration. One of the psychological difficulties of war reporting is that you are making your living — and even sometimes a good living — reporting on the deaths of others. You're not killing people. You're not making things worse. You're an observer, and the world's tragedies need observers, right? So it's all good. Except that you can get — or at least I got — this sense of moral accountability. You spend your whole life being paid to observe, from a bit of a remove, the deaths of other people. There's a kind of moral debt there. And for me, there was an enormous amount of guilt that came from that.\n\nI stopped war reporting after one of my best friends, Tim Hetherington, was killed in combat in Libya. I didn't want to annihilate all the people that loved me like he had just annihilated everyone who loved him. My marriage fell apart. I remarried. I had a family. I started this very peaceful, beautiful life. And it never occurred to me that you can leave the front lines and, eventually, the front lines will come to you.\n\nSo what I decided to do, in terms of writing about my own death, was to say to myself, “I was analytical and dispassionate about the circumstances around other people's death. I deserve no better and no worse treatment. I'll do that with my own near death.”\n\nAnd then, finally, there's inherent drama in it. The name of the boat in The Perfect Storm was the Andrea Gail. And The Perfect Storm is basically me documenting all of the things that sank that boat and killed those men. And I thought, I'm the Andrea Gail now. I'll just document all the things that sank me — or almost sank me.\n\nLet's talk about near-death experiences. They are, as you observe in the book, medical paradoxes. The brain is an incredibly resource-intensive organ. It uses 15 percent of the oxygenated blood in our bodies, 20 percent of the glucose. And yet there is this inexplicable phenomenon that just as the brain is dying, people have vivid hallucinations. What explanations do scientists have for why that might happen?\n\nThere are two camps. There are scientists and doctors who have researched this extensively and documented thousands and thousands of cases and come to the conclusion that this is not explainable through ordinary science and it may offer some proof of an afterlife. And then, of course, there's the other side, the rationalists, who are like, “Nonsense! If we give you low blood oxygen, your brain will get all wonky. And if we put you in a human centrifuge, like they do with fighter pilots and subject you to five Gs, you'll see a tunnel and light and all kinds of strange visions. If we give you LSD, you'll hallucinate all kinds of crazy things.”\n\nI read through all this, and at first I was sort of rooting for an afterlife. I was like, Oh my god, this is amazing. Maybe there is something more. For an atheist to think that, imagine how anxious I was to allow myself that thought. And then I read the counterarguments, and I was like, OK, the rationalists got this, right? They just listed all these things that can happen in the dying brain and that pretty much explains everything. Except for one thing. The dying see the dead, and people who aren't dying do not see the dead. The doctors in the room, the family members in the room — they don't see Aunt Sally crouched in the corner. Only the dying are startled to see Aunt Sally and start talking to her.\n\nWe know that if you give a room full of people LSD, 100 percent of them will hallucinate. And we know why. We know how LSD affects the brain. There's no mystery there. But they won't all hallucinate the same thing. And what's strange about dying is that in a considerable portion of the cases, the dying see the dead. It's the one thing about all this that I'm like, All right, I'm still an atheist, but I have to say that fact I find hard to explain in rational terms. Does it mean there's an afterlife? Does it mean there's a god? No, I'm not going to assert that. But what I am willing to say is— I do not believe in god, and I don't believe in an afterlife, but my opinions are couched in a context of doubt. I understand that I might be wrong. Before this happened to me, I was an atheist, and I didn't think I was wrong. Now I'm an atheist, and I allow for the possibility that I'm actually completely wrong, and that we don't have a fundamental understanding of the nature of reality, the nature of consciousness, the nature of the universe. A correct understanding might allow for some post-death existence at the subatomic, quantum level, and we just are not capable of understanding it and may never be.\n\nIt's been almost four years since your near-death experience. How often do you think about it?\n\nYou know, if a good friend or my wife had died four years ago, I would be thinking about it, off and on, probably every day. It would be the new context of my life, but less and less the focus of my attention, and less and less a matter of painful emotionality. And so what was extremely painful for me, emotionally painful, after I almost died — I would say almost unbearably painful — is now just a weird fact about me. Wow, that time I almost died? Crazy.\n\nSometimes people ask me, “Do you live differently now?” I've given that a lot of thought. If you were observing me with a CCTV camera all day long, I don't think my life would look like it's different. I'm not sitting in the lotus position. But what I would say is that, internally, it is a little bit different. And I'll sort of illustrate with an anecdote from the great Russian writer Dostoevsky.\n\nSo Dostoevsky, when he was a young man, was a political agitator. He openly discussed liberating the serfs. This is in the 1840s in Tsarist Russia. And he and his buddies who enjoyed talking about such things were promptly arrested and thrown in prison for eight months by the Tsar’s police.\n\nAfter about eight months, they were rounded up and loaded into a carriage. They expected to be released. It wasn't a serious crime. It was just a slap on the wrist. But instead of being released, they were driven to a town square and tied to posts and a firing squad was arranged before them. And so these poor young men only had a couple of minutes to adjust to the idea that they were about to die.\n\nDostoevsky was contemplating this, and he saw some sunlight glinting on a roof, and he thought, In moments, I'm going to be part of the sunlight. I'm going to be part of everything. And if somehow I should be granted the chance to live, I will make every individual moment an eternity. I will appreciate everything.\n\nYou can't live constantly like that. But if you can attain that dead-man-walking appreciation of reality and life and the earth, even for a few moments a day, you will change your perspective on everything. And so that's what I try to do, and frankly, it calms me down when I'm in a traffic jam, or when my kids are stressing me out, or whatever. If you just return to the sunlight glinting on the roof, like, Oh, I'm part of all things and every moment is its own miracle, it is a kind of zen practice that actually gets you to see life and experience life a little bit differently."
