        "text": "There is a simple reason Trump is placating Putin even as he has attacked Assad.\n\nI have never witnessed children suffocate from a chemical weapons attack, so the worst thing I have ever seen as a reporter remains the dead women and children that were piled up as a protest in front of the American Embassy in Monrovia during the waning days of the Liberian civil war. It was 2003 and the United States had just invaded Iraq. I didn’t know what to do before the tangle of bodies before me so I decided to count them. Someone should know this number, I thought. They had died earlier in the day when a mortar hit a crowd of civilians who had sought refuge in an annex of the U.S. embassy, and as I counted the bodies, a crowd of angry Liberians gathered around me. I wrote the number “27” in my notebook. I felt completely numb. “Where is your army?” the men in the crowd started to yell. “Why won’t you invade us?”\n\nSEVERAL years ago I spent time with a platoon of Army infantry at a remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan, and after the deployment I was surprised that only one of the soldiers chose to leave the military at the end of his contract; many others re-upped and eventually went on to fight for another year in the same area. The soldier who got out, Brendan O’Byrne, remained a good friend of mine as he struggled to fit in to civilian life back home.\n\nA strategic passage wanted by the Taliban and al-Qaeda, Afghanistan’s Korengal Valley is among the deadliest pieces of terrain in the world for U.S. forces. One platoon is considered the tip of the American spear. Its men spend their days in a surreal combination of backbreaking labor—building outposts on rocky ridges—and deadly firefights, while they try to avoid the mistakes the Russians made. Sebastian Junger and photographer Tim Hetherington join the platoon’s painfully slow advance, as its soldiers laugh, swear, and run for cover, never knowing which of them won’t make it home.\n\nAfghanistan’s master guerrilla commander, Ahmed Shah Massoud, was assassinated by suspected al-Qaeda suicide bombers just two days before September 11. But his Northern Alliance coalition became the U.S.’s most important weapon against the Taliban in a war that combined 19th-century slaughter and 21st-century technology. As alliance soldiers marched on Kabul—with a massed-infantry assault amid the deadly shadows of B-52 bombers—the author saw Massoud’s legacy revealed, in the Afghans’ hatred of foreigners fighting for the Taliban, in their readiness to die for freedom, and even, poignantly, in one man’s act of mercy.\n\nTerrorized and recruited by the army, by rebel groups, and by private militias, a generation of Liberian kids know little but inhuman cruelty and slaughter. Will the arrival of peacekeeping forces and the departure of President Charles Taylor end the violence that has raged since 1989, when Taylor began his war on the corrupt, U.S.-backed Doe regime? In a country where diamond traffickers, arms dealers, and al-Qaeda all have profited from the mayhem, the author witnesses a deadly attack on thousands of civilians seeking refuge in a compound next to the American Embassy.\n\nThe photographs on these pages, of torture and executions by the rebels of Sierra Leone, are among the best pieces of evidence documenting the Revolutionary United Front's savage war against civilians. Yet until now, barely a handful of people knew these shocking images existed. With a special court for war crimes being set up to try captured rebel leader Foday Sankoh and other top R.U.F. commanders, the author tells how the photos came to be published here, for the first time, thanks to a courageous victim who barely escaped death to bring back a damning record of atrocities."
