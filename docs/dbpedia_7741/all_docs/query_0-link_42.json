[06:15]\n\nWhat profound truths were made clear in the aftermath of this traumatic brush with death? [09:21]\n\nSebastian has always been willing to take risks (like reporting from war-torn countries). Did becoming a father and surviving the aneurysm change this? [12:48]\n\nWhat lessons did Sebastian learn from picking up two hobbies no ordinary 51-year-old would pursue: boxing and playing the accordion? What itch does boxing seem to scratch? [16:07]\n\nWhat compelled Sebastian to pick up the accordion, and how has it rewarded him? [18:37]\n\nHow successful have Sebastian’s efforts to raise his two daughters in an “elemental, mindful, tribal manner” been thus far, and what is his foray into fatherhood teaching him? Why does he think he’s getting more from the experience in his 50s than he would have in his 20s? [21:54]\n\nHow does Sebastian relate to the aging process of a warrior, and how did Crow chief Plenty Coups come to understand the role as one of protection rather than ego-driven aggression in order to ensure the survival of his own tribe into the 20th century? [28:42]\n\nWhat prompted Sebastian to write his new book, Freedom, and why is it divided into three sections: Run, Fight, and Think? [39:26]\n\nWhy is the inclusion of women in insurgencies crucial to their success? [47:47]\n\nSebastian shares the story behind The Last Patrol, and how walking hundreds of miles along American railroad tracks gave him an unparalleled sense of freedom. [52:05]\n\nDid the structure of Freedom change from conception to finished product? [57:44]\n\nWhile studying history and witnessing firsthand how terrible human beings can be to other human beings, how does Sebastian refrain from withdrawing into full-blown nihilism? [1:00:48]\n\nAs an atheist, why did Sebastian choose to preface Freedom with a verse from the Bible? [1:07:21]\n\nOn the mental trick that humans have used throughout history to downgrade people from “other” groups to subhuman status in order to remorselessly exploit, subjugate, torture, or kill them. [1:09:28]\n\nWhat is the Gini coefficient, and how does it tie in with the discomforting etymology of the word “freedom” and the relative inequality of history’s most dominant empires? [1:12:13]\n\nWhat does Sebastian hope people will take away from Freedom or perhaps ponder more closely after reading it? [1:19:07]\n\nAs free individuals, what do we owe our society? [1:24:42]\n\nAn ask of the audience: figure out what you owe. [1:30:51]\n\nSebastian’s advice, as a new father, to aspiring parents. [1:34:31]\n\nParting thoughts. [1:36:39]\n\nPEOPLE MENTIONED\n\nJosh Waitzkin\n\nStuart Krichevsky\n\nPlenty Coups\n\nJoan of Arc\n\nJonathan Lear\n\nFrancisco Vázquez de Coronado\n\nTim Hetherington\n\nGuillermo Cervera\n\nMalcolm Gladwell\n\nCorrado Gini\n\nMichael Mallin\n\nRelated"
