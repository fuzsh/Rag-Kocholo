        "text": "Junger had just come from Gloucester City Hall, where 250 people overflowed an auditorium last week to hear him read from his latest book, “In My Time of Dying: How I Came Face to Face with the Idea of an Afterlife.” It’s been that way for every one of his books since “The Perfect Storm.”\n\n“None of those [subsequent] books have had anything to do with Gloucester, but when my publisher is mapping out the book tour, I’ll always say, ‘You wouldn’t necessarily think Gloucester is a good spot, but trust me,’ ” he said. “I’ve lived in New York City for 25 years, and I’ll do a reading there and have 50 people come out. But I come back to Gloucester, and it will be many times that.”\n\nAnd there is a reason for that, one you hear over and over when you talk to the residents of this gritty coastal city on Cape Ann — he did right by them.\n\n“He told our story with respect,” said Mary Anne Shatford, whose brother, Bobby Shatford, was one of the crew members aboard the Andrea Gail, the swordfish boat that went down during the epic 1991 storm that Junger would immortalize in “The Perfect Storm.”\n\n“He got inside our lives and told it from the inside out,” Shatford said. “He was passionate. He stuck to the facts. And now he’s an adopted son of the city. It’s a very personal thing.”\n\nWhen he began researching what became “The Perfect Storm,” Junger was in his early 30s, living with a girlfriend in a dilapidated house in Gloucester, working as a tree climber, with loose aspirations of making a career in journalism. He was toying with the idea of writing about dangerous jobs when he started researching the tragic story of the Andrea Gail. That’s when he walked into the Crow’s Nest.\n\nAt the dark dive bar beloved by fishermen and avoided by others, Junger approached Ethel Shatford Preston, Bobby and Mary Anne’s mother, who was a bartender known for being as tough as the clientele she had to police.\n\n“I was a kid who grew up in a wealthy suburb [Belmont] with Harvard professors for neighbors, and when I first walked into the Crow’s Nest I was so nervous, because I was like, ‘What right do I have to dig this stuff up,’ ” Junger remembered. “But I developed a relationship with Ethel, and she was the one who signaled, ‘This guy is OK. He’s trying to do a good thing.’ ”\n\nIt was a relationship that became so meaningful to both of them that when Ethel died in 1999, Junger was asked to speak at her funeral.\n\nBut she was not the only one he won over. When the book came out in 1997, his first reading was in Gloucester, and the nerves came again when he arrived to see a packed house, “full of people who looked like they’d been fishing their whole lives,” Junger recalled. “But they just loved the book. And that was it for me. Forget The New York Times review. That was what I was looking for.”\n\nThe film version, which came out in 2000, was not as beloved here. “Very Hollywood” is how locals describe it. And while it was nice to have George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg hanging out around town, don’t get them started on Diane Lane’s attempt at a Gloucester accent.\n\nBut the love for Junger has always remained, and a Junger appearance is the biggest literary event in the city “by a lot,” said Arwen Severance, owner of the Bookstore of Gloucester, which hosts his readings. They still get tourists who come to town, buy the book, and ask for directions to all the places mentioned.\n\n“He’s given an almost mythical significance to the city,” said Charlee Bianchini, one of the bookstore employees, who emceed the event.\n\nAnd Junger himself has risen to almost mythical significance following his “Storm” success, carving out an acclaimed journalism career, with numerous best-selling books and acclaimed war documentaries.\n\nBut his latest work may be his most personal — an account of a sudden, near-fatal medical episode in 2020, while with his wife and two young daughters at a property they own deep in a wooded area of Cape Cod. After being rushed to the hospital, he was clinging to life as doctors raced to stop a ruptured aneurysm that was causing massive internal bleeding.\n\nAs this happened, Junger, an avowed atheist who has survived several brushes with death as a war correspondent, said he was surprised to feel a darkness encroaching. Then he was visited by his late father, who told him it was OK to come with him. He did not accept the invitation.\n\nAs he recounted the tale to the packed audience at the Gloucester reading, you could hear a pin drop. “In My Time of Dying” is the story of that event, the emotional recovery, and his exploration of the scientific and philosophical questions of what happens after we die.\n\nAfter the reading, an hour-long line snaked around the auditorium of people waiting to have him sign his new book and, of course, copies of “The Perfect Storm.”\n\nWhen it was over, Junger, who is 62 now, did what he always does when he comes to Gloucester. He headed to the Crow’s Nest with Mary Anne Shatford and her husband, Greg Sousa, who owns the bar.\n\nMary Anne was carrying an old photo she’d dug out, showing a young Junger sitting in the bar with Ethel, a freshly printed copy of “The Perfect Storm” in front of them, a walk into the past, a constant present."
