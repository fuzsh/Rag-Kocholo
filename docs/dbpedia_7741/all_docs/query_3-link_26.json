        "text": "The author of 'The Perfect Storm\" is the keynote speaker to open the Morristown Festival of Books on Friday, Sept. 30\n\nOne of Junger's ancestors, Grimm, who emigrated to fight in the American Revolution, was related to the folklorist Brothers who chronicled German fairy tale\n\nJunger's father contributed to the war effort by working on jet engines in Paterson\n\nHis latest book, \"Tribe,\" grew out of an article he wrote for Vanity Fair: 'How PTSD Became a Problem Far Beyond the Battlefield'\n\nJunger feels that humans are hard-wired genetically to exist in a tribal, communal environment\n\nSebastian Junger grew up in Belmont, Massachusetts, a prosperous tree-lined suburb not far from Boston. Belmont is also about a half-hour from Gloucester, America's oldest seaport and the fishing town from which the doomed crew of the Andrea Gail set sail in 1991. That story was the basis for Junger's 1997 megaseller, and subsequent 2000 movie, \"The Perfect Storm.\"\n\nHe has long been a freelance journalist and war correspondent. On assignment for Vanity Fair, Junger spent a year in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley, embedded with a regiment of the U.S. Army. The outpost was remote, tiny and wholly primitive; the platoon was continuously in peril and under siege. The platoon developed unprecedented camaraderie of unique shared experience.\n\nTo survive, any group reverts to a more 'primitive' stage of social development. Far from the strictures of society, warriors develop their own brand of authority, their own community. To survive, they must exercise fundamental traits that helped our species evolve. Returning home, there's no place for the men they've become; they are treated like victims.\n\nJunger collaborated with late British-American photojournalist Tim Hetherington to produce two documentaries based on the experience. With the tagline, \"One platoon, one valley, one year,\" \"Restrepo\" (named for a platoon medic killed earlier in the campaign) was a 2010 Best Documentary Academy Award nominee. \"Korengal,'\" in 2014, was the sequel. Junger co-directed both.\n\nHis latest book, \"Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging,\" was published earlier this year by Twelve (Hachette). It grew out of an article he wrote for Vanity Fair, \"How PTSD Became a Problem Far Beyond the Battlefield.\"\n\nThis Friday, Sept. 30, book lovers and lovers of good storytelling can meet and listen to Junger when he is the keynote speaker for the opening of the Morristown Festival of Books. His presentation will begin at 7:30 p.m. at the Mayo Performing Arts Center in Morristown. The book festival continues on Saturday, Oct. 1, with a full day’s program of free author talks.\n\nREAD: Our Mondays with Authors series\n\nREAD: Meet our 2016 Super Summer Reader Club members\n\nREAD: Central Jersey's entertainment scene\n\nThe journey begins\n\nJunger's father, Dr. Miguel Chapero Junger, was born in Dresden in 1923, lived in Madrid until that civil war, then in Paris until the beginning of World War II when he came to America to escape the Nazis. He received a PhD in physics from Harvard, was fluent in five languages, and did groundbreaking work for the U.S. Navy and NASA, at one point working on jet engines in Paterson. He was 37 when he married Junger's mother in 1960.\n\nEllen Sinclair is a painter who grew up in Ohio and whose family once owned an amusement park in Canton. She moved to Boston when she was 18 to study art, met Miguel in the bar of the Ritz Hotel, and eloped to marry him at age 29. Sebastian was born in 1962.\n\nMwA: Storytelling roots on your mother's side go back to The Brothers Grimm. Were you always drawn to storytelling?\n\nSJ: Honestly, I was terrible at math, terrible in science, terrible at spelling in grade school and high school. But I really like history and was always good at writing.\n\nMwA: Knowing your family background, I was surprised to read that by 1984, when the you graduated from Wesleyan, you'd hardly been west of the Hudson River. Did that include New Jersey?\n\nSJ: It did. I'd been to Europe, traveled, but not in America.\n\nMwA: How did you remedy that?\n\nSJ: Right after I graduated college, I decided to hitchhike across the country.\n\nMwA: You theorize that one definition of 'tribe' might be feeling compelled to share the last of your food, thereby taking responsibility for a stranger. When was the first time you experienced that?\n\nSJ: I found myself in Gillette, Wyoming one morning with nothing but my tent and sleeping bag, some cooking equipment, and a week's worth of food. I was standing beside an on-ramp where some truckers opened their windows to throw beer bottles at me as they drove by.\n\nThe philosophy\n\n\"Tribe\" is based is on the premise that the two behaviors which set early humans apart from other primates were sharing of food, and altruistic group defense. Inter-reliance helped set us on an evolutionary path that eventually produced the modern world.\n\nJunger posits that soldiers experience this tribal way of thinking during war but, returning home, realize they were actually fighting for their unit – not for a group that isn't willing to make similar sacrifices on their behalf.\n\nMwA: You write that adaptive behavior is reinforced hormonally, emotionally, and culturally. Why is this important?\n\nSJ: People forget that we are a product of evolution. This is not arbitrary. We exist because we developed those traits that helped us survive as a species. That runs afoul of a lot of political sensibility - violence is often seen as moral malfunctioning. But a behavior that is so widespread had to be necessary for survival – it's hard-wired into us, part of our ancient hunting instinct. As humans, we respond to fluctuations of adrenalin and hormones.\n\nAnd it's not simply economic. Crime dropped during the Great Recession, and during bombings like The Blitz, morale was never higher. Mining disasters. Catastrophe makes everyone equal. Humans don't mind hardship; they thrive on it.\n\nMwA: You write that humans are genetically wired to exist in a tribal, communal environment.\n\nSJ: We are. We're a cooperative species. That's why so many feel lost in today's society.\n\nModern society\n\nMwA: Describe \"the sheer predictability of life in an American suburb.\"\n\nSJ: As I experienced it as a kid, nothing truly frightening or dangerous ever happened that required collective effort. Things were taken care of by police, or the fire department, or maintenance crews.\n\nMwA: And that's a negative?\n\nSJ: Humans – young males particularly – are wired to deal with ordeal. Without rites of passage, what often results is law-breaking. And military service is no longer required How do you become a man in a world that doesn't require your courage?\n\nThat's the reason young males have several times the mortality rate of young females, they're genetically driven, so they act in bizarre and stupid ways. All you have to do is go to the internet, 17-year-old-buys skateboarding off roofs.\n\nMwA: You once had a mentor who told you stories about early settlers who ran off to join the Indians, and frontier captives who, despite witnessing horrifying cruelty, refused to return to civilization. But the opposite was never true. Then, as a journalist, you encountered American soldiers who preferred to return to Afghanistan rather than resume life in the U.S.\n\nWhat about modern society is so unappealing that war-weary soldiers prefer primitive conditions to homecoming?\n\nSJ: Lack of small group structure and lack of connection. The Iroquois, for example, have formal rituals that involve the whole clan to welcome warriors home This is certainly ancient and widespread and therefore probably healthy. We don't have anything like that.\n\nPTSD, evolution and rites of passage\n\nJunger's first experience with classic short-term (acute) PTSD was in 2001, after two months in Afghanistan. Although he no longer thought about the horrors of war, he found himself on a subway platform during rush hour, absolutely convinced he was going to die – and more frightened than he'd ever been under fire.\n\nHe learned that PTSD is a natural and healthy response to danger From an evolutionary perspective, certain traits are necessary when your life is at risk: sleeping lightly/waking easily, heightened vigilance, quick reaction to strange noises, and flashbacks that remind you of the danger. Unpleasant but – in common with other mammals – preferable to being eaten.\n\nMwA: You say that, in fact, only about 20 percent of people exposed to trauma react with long-term (chronic) PTSD; that it mostly self-corrects over time.\n\nSJ: Stress is the essence of evolution by natural selection. Humans share an evolutionary history of extreme hardship and violence. We survived by working together. If that were not true, our species would have died out long ago.\n\nMwA: Our modern world is almost unrecognizable since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nSJ: My mother was born in 1929 when most people didn't have electricity. Even some of the last American Indians fighting in the Montana Territory against Custer (1839-1876) – the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne, the Arapahos – lived into the middle of the 20th century. And since, we dropped two nuclear bombs. Think about that.\n\nMwA: You cite that war after war has been a hallmark of the last century, but only about 10 percent of our armed forces actually see combat. Inversely, while American combat deaths have dropped steadily, trauma and disability/PTSD claims continue to rise. How to explain this paradox?\n\nSJ: Studies show that vets affected by PTSD are exhibiting reactions to something other than direct exposure to danger. The most basic definition of community, of tribe, is a group of people you would help feed and help defend. One way to evaluate the health of a society might be to look at how quickly its soldiers recover, psychologically, from the experience of combat.\n\nWhat people mind is not feeling necessary. A society that doesn't offer its members the opportunity to act selflessly . . . it isn't a society in any tribal sense. It's just a political entity that, lacking enemies, will probably fall apart on its own.\"\n\nMwA: Considering your degree was in Cultural Anthropology, 'Tribe' makes perfect sense. You make the point that in some primitive societies – for example, American Indians at the time of the Constitution – personal poverty was unknown, the natural rights of man were actively promoted, and neither is a hallmark of today's civilized life.\n\nMwA: You say that modern society has perfected the art of making people not necessary: 'It's time for that to end.' How?\n\nSJ: (Laughter) That was going to be in the unwritten fifth chapter of Tribe.\n\nI'm not sure we can solve it, it's too complex – but it may solve itself. As a society gets wealthier, it can sustain more and more non-contributors. But all you need is a crisis, a catastrophe, and people are called into duty; they band together, cooperate to survive. Fortunately – and unfortunately – these (survival) instincts are going to be needed again.\n\nMwA: What would you risk dying for?\n\nSJ: Certainly the people I care about. But also, for human dignity. When human dignity has been violated, when it includes the loss of innocent life – that's when it's really time to step up.\n\nThere was an extraordinary study published of people, more likely to be women, who had hidden Jewish families in their basements during pogroms and the Holocaust. They were defending human dignity. That would stir my courage.\n\nMwA: Your father, a French immigrant, passed away in 2012. Shortly after receiving your selective service card at eighteen, you were surprised at a principle he shared with you: 'You don't owe your country nothing. And depending on what happens, you might owe it your life.'\n\nSJ: It was an imprinting moment for me because age I grew up in was so anti-war. Yet it was his generation that effectively saved world from Fascism. I grew up not understanding that it doesn't come free.\n\nMwA: Did you consider the military?\n\nSJ: There were no wars to fight by the time I was eligible. And there were things that I felt more morally compelling.\n\n'The Perfect Storm' and the common thread\n\nMwA: What drew you to the story behind 'The Perfect Storm?' What did it have in common with 'Tribe?' And your documentaries?\n\nSJ: Originally I had a job as a climber for a tree company until I tore up my leg with a chainsaw. Now I realize that my interest in those jobs, in dangerous work, is because they foster a commonality, a close community.\n\nMwA: How so?\n\nSJ: By functioning in an old-fashioned way where the ethos is welfare of the group. Crews dedicated to safety take risks on behalf of the group. That's ancient behavior. Especially in males, it's directly connected to the dangers of hunting game. The adaptive behavior we had to develop and master to survive.\n\nThose are the topics that always drew me – clearly a through-line towards communalism and the nobility of putting the welfare of the group before individual concerns.\n\nMwA: 'Tribe' is very personal.\n\nSJ: It embodies themes I've been thinking about my whole life. It's very, very important. The style falls way, way outside topics readers normally associate with my writing. It's an academic book, no storyline. I wrote it knowing it would either sell very well or nose-dive but that didn't matter. Most important was doing a good job, helping people discover something essential to our society. For me, it's a far more important book that' Perfect Storm' could ever be.\n\nAbout the Morristown Festival of Books\n\nSebastian Junger's keynote presentation to open the Morristown Festival of Books will begin at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30, at the Mayo Performing Arts Center in Morristown.
