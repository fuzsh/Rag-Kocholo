        "text": "Muchos Méxicos\n\nInspired by a student, Anghelo Chavira Barrera ’24, a new interdisciplinary bilingual class about the history of Mexico at CA is collaborative in every respect. Department X faculty endowment support allowed Spanish teacher Carmen Welton and history teacher Jeffrey Richey to create the course. Partnering from different pedagogical backgrounds involved learning with and in front of their class, and on a trip they led during spring break, students indeed encountered many Mexicos."
