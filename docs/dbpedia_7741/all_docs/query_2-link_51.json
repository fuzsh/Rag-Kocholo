        "text": "War is a book written by Sebastian Junger about the Afghan War.\n\nWar: As Soldiers Really Live It is a creative nonfiction book written by Sebastian Junger and published by W. W. Norton & Company in 2010.\n\nAccompanied by photojournalist Tim Hetherington, Junger spent months embedded with second platoon of Battle Company, part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in the Korengal Valley, a transit corridor for Taliban fighters coming into Afghanistan from Pakistan, between 2007 and 2008. Junger experienced the conditions of the infantry soldier first-hand, witnessing daily firefights and surviving an IED attack on Humvee while on patrol.\n\nJunger profiles multiple soldiers, including Staff Sergent Sal Giunta. His actions during the fighting in the Korengal Valley made him the first soldier to still be alive when receiving the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War.[1]\n\nJunger with Tim Hetherington in 2011.\n\nThe 173rd Airborne Brigade.\n\nMedal of honor recipient Sgt. Salvatore Giunta and President Barack Obama.\n\nIn Other Media\n\n[edit]\n\nPortions of the book originally appeared as dispatches for Vanity Fair. The documentary film Restrepo, produced and directed by Junger and Hetherington about the soldierâ€™s experience at Combat Outpost (COP) Korengal, was nominated for the 2011 Academy Award for Best Documentary.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nDexter Filkins writing in the New York Times said that \"Junger has found a novel and interesting lens through which to view the conflict in Afghanistan, and he captures many things a lesser writer might miss.\"[2] \"I have never read a more compelling account of the complex suffering and rewards of the combat experience,\" wrote Antanas Sileika in the Globe and Mail.[3]\n\nTime magazine named War a \"Top Ten Non-fiction Book\" of 2010.[4]"
