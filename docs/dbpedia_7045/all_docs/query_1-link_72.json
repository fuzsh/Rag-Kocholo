        "text": "The Dreamworks animated film “Madagascar” was about a group of animals who escape from a metropolitan zoo in an effort to return to the wilderness. Like many animated films, it included secondary characters who have no purpose beyond comic relief. Such characters do not have the complex development arc to follow, so they can just be funny. Those are the kinds of characters I really like. In Madagascar, the secondary characters were a team of penguins following their own plan to escape from the same zoo. As entertaining characters the penguins were successful enough that Dreamworks spun them off into their own television show, which is produced by Nickelodeon.\n\nThe four penguins are Rico, Skipper, Private and Kowalski. Skipper is the leader, and speaks with a speedy patter reminiscent of hardboiled detective movies. Kolwalski is the smart one. He’s a genius who reportedly is unable to read. I like his name because it was also a character in the old TV show “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea”. Tossing a Polish name into the mix used to be standard material in combat related stories. Rico is a supposedly a “weapons and explosives” expert. He is a sub verbal character who is able to regurgitate any thing they might need. Private is the omega in the group, but he provides a simplicity that helps group from becoming too weird. Why he has an English accent I don’t know.\n\nWhen the show first aired, I watched an episode. But I was disappointed. It just didn’t work then, and I didn’t follow up. But recently my nine year old was watching it, and I joined him. I found it much funnier now. I was continuously entertained, and at a brisk pace too. It is an excellent cartoon, and the show also got me thinking about comedy teams.\n\nI realized that comedy teams create their own reality. Such teams are blissfully out of touch with what other people are thinking. They develop a small society, reinforcing each others beliefs. They understand each other where outsiders would be confused. They develop language to suit their purposes, and their verbal stylings become a humor of their own. The penguins all share the same delusions about their situation. It’s like an improv comedy group where saying no stops the momentum. They are a team, in the sense of a sports team who play together to win. None of them would stop and say their plan is foolish, unless they had an even more foolish plan in mind.\n\nTeams tend to have a leader, or at least a star. Groucho was the most functional of the Marx Brothers, he could actually catch a woman or become president of a country. Skipper is the alpha of the penguins, and he is somewhat paranoid. He tends to get very dramatic about their situation, and the rest of them follow orders. His over-reaction is often what drives the comedy. The para-military theme of their operation allows for lots of action.\n\nAnother characteristic of great comedy teams is their energy. Like the Marx Brothers or the Three Stooges, the shear speed and determination of the penguins overwhelms the rest of the zoo society. The “normal” world doesn’t have a chance. The comedians also have strange talents that allow them to achieve things others can’t.\n\nAlso, comedy team members each have distinct and interesting styles. They can break off individually, or into subgroups, and the dynamic changes and allows for fresh direction. The variety adds depth to the individual personalities, and broadens the range of comedy.\n\nEven though the penguins are funny, they are serious about what they do. To balance the energy they are often interacting with the lighthearted disco dancing lemurs who also came from the first movie. The lemurs form a team of their own, and the two teams in relation form a kind of comedy duo. Serious team in contrast with silly team.\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar were created by Eric McGrath and Eric Darnell. The show is directed by Brett Haaland and Nick Filippi.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nM. Wilson Disher wrote “Clowns and Pantomimes” which was published in 1925. He lays out six varieties of physical comedy. These are:\n\nFALLS, BLOWS, SURPRISE, KNAVERY, MIMICRY, and STUPIDITY\n\nFALLS. Easily the first one to come to mind. Gravity reminds us we are not special. The more important or serious the person is, the funnier it is when they fall. There are many combinations of people and ways of falling. It’s really about the set up, and also about having a reasonable belief that the person isn’t seriously injured. It’s about making them look foolish.\n\nBLOWS This is the bread and butter of the Three Stooges. It’s also the category that pie fights fall into.\n\nSURPRISE One reason Buster Keaton was considered a great film maker was his ability to set up surprises. You are all set to see one thing, then he gives you another. There are two good surprises in this clip from his short film “One Week.”\n\nKNAVERY is the sneaky stealing of things. The sly trickster is appealing. He is the partner of stupidity. I immediately thought of Harpo Marx.\n\nMIMICRY. You probably noticed the brief moment of mimicry in the previous clip. When someone pretends to be some one or something else, it is funny. Dressing in drag is a form of mimicry. The greater the skill, the greater the comedy. Jim Carrey has great skill and he pushes the exaggeration as far as he can.\n\nSTUPIDITY. Here’s the problem with demonstrations of stupidity: The professionals have been pushed out of the market by the amateurs. I’m talking about “fail” videos. Damn if there aren’t lots of cameras trained on lots of stupid people. But we want to see how the professionals act stupid. The comedy of mistakes. It’s about seeing things wrong, being confused, but it’s also seeing things in a different way. The stupid character misinterprets directions and repeatedly makes the same mistake over again. Stan Laurel was one of the great stupid comedians.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
