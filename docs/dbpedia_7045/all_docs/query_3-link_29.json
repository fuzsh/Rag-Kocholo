        "text": "What is The Penguin about?\n\nThe Penguin is an upcoming crime drama television show based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The television show is a spin-off from The Batman and is executive produced by Matt Reeves, who directed the movie. The Penguin is created by Lauren LeFranc who serves as showrunner and writes all of the episodes. The Penguin is produced by DC Studios and Warner Bros. Television Studios for the streaming service Max.\n\nWho is starring in The Penguin?\n\nAcclaimed actor Colin Farrell reprises his role as Oswald ‘Oz’ Cobblepot/The Penguin, the underground crime kingpin on the rise. Cristin Milioti plays the character Sofia Falcone, the daughter of late mob boss Carmine Falcone, while Michael Zegen portrays her brother Alberto Falcone. Clancy Brown stars as rival crime lord Salvatore Maroni. The wider cast includes Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Deirdre O’Connell, James Madio, Scott Cohen, Jared Abrahamson, and others.\n\nIs The Penguin set in the same universe as The Batman?\n\nThe Penguin TV show is set in the same timeline as The Batman movie directed by Matt Reeves. The series takes place after the events of The Batman and explores the rise of The Penguin as a crime boss, filling the vacuum left by the death of Carmine Falcone.\n\nIs Batman in The Penguin?\n\nBatman actor Robert Pattinson has been spotted on The Penguin set suggesting that he will make a cameo appearance in the series. There is no official statement on his return to the role for this series, though Pattinson is confirmed to be starring as Batman in the next Batman movie."
