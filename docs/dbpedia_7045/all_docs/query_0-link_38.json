        "text": "The Penguins of Madagascar is an animated series co-created by Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley that was based on Dreamworks Madagascar film franchise that ran on Nickelodeon from 2008-2015. The series revolves around the 4 penguins from the films (Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private) the often go undercover in every episode to protect their home at Central Park Zoo from various circumstances.\n\nPilot Versions\n\nSometime in the mid-2000s after production of Schooley's other show Kim Possible wrapped up. Him and his team joined another to help on a pitch pilot to help pitch to both Nickelodeon and Dreamworks. When the pilot's director Josh Book saw the early pilot's animatic, he realized it had too many characters and wanted to simplify the plot to focus more on both the penguins and the lemurs. They then animated the pilot with small changes to how they look in the films most notably the fur on the animals looking more sculpted to make animating easier.[1] Both Nickelodeon and Dreamworks were impressed and green lit the pilot into a full series.\n\nStatus\n\nThe only footage of the pitch that resurfaced came from Books' portfolio running a minute long.[2] It's unknown if more of it was made or this was the pilot. No footage of the early animatic had resurfaced, and any more information on these versions of the pilot is unavailable as of 2023.\n\nGallery\n\nScreenshots\n\nSee Also\n\nAnthology and Short Series\n\nAstrology with Squidward (found series of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" Nickelodeon animated shorts; early 2000s)\n\nAttack of the Giant Vulture (found Nickelodeon short film; 1998)\n\nBalinese Slapping Fish (found Nickelodeon Australia animated short series; 1998)\n\nBobby the Lizard Boy (found Nickelodeon animated short; 2000)\n\nEddie Retractorhead (partially lost Nickelodeon UK animated short series; 2008)\n\nGordon Bleugh!
