        "text": "Although they only appear as comic relief in the movies, the penguins have proven to be Ensemble Darkhorses to the point that they received their own show, The Penguins of Madagascar and a recently announced solo movie. After all, Everything's Better with Penguins.\n\nNote that this character sheet applies only to the TV series canon. For tropes related to the characters in the movie franchises, go here.\n\nSkipper\n\nThe leader of a Badass Crew of Commando Penguins, voiced by DreamWorks animator/TV series co-creator Tom McGrath. He speaks in a crisp, hard-edged tone like a cool spy from a film noir movie. In the TV series, Skipper is somewhat abrasive with the other three penguins, often chastizing them and Dope Slapping them to keep them in line.\n\nTropes associated with Skipper:\n\nAfraid of Needles: In \"Needle Point,\" he goes well out of his way to avoid getting a shot.\n\nAnti-Hero: Type III. A lethal Anti-Hero.\n\nBadass\n\nBerserk Button: Okay, so he doesn't go berserk, per se, but Skipper really doesn't like it when you call him fat, or any of its synonyms. He likes to claim it's muscle.\n\nHe really doesn't like Hoboken, NJ.\n\nThe Captain\n\nDope Slap: Used often on his comrades. Sometimes all three in one swing.\n\nFantastic Racism: He occasionally makes less-than-complimentary remarks towards mammals. He especially dislikes humans.\n\nFour-Temperament Ensemble: The Choleric.\n\nGood Is Not Nice: Technically the penguins are the heroes of the series. Technically.\n\nThe Hero: Occasionally, though, he and the others do come off as jerks, but they almost always save the day in the end.\n\nIt's All My Fault: Done twice. The first time was when he poked a hole in Julien's bouncy house causing him to lose his crown; the other, when one of the chimps causes him and the penguins to spin out and loss a race to the lemurs. In the latter episode, also he accepts full responsibility despite the fact he did nothing that caused it. He even said they would have his resignation in the morning because of his shame and guilt.\n\nNever My Fault: The one time it was his fault, he pinned the blame on Private.\n\nLarge Ham: Lots of dramatic closeups and exaggerated gestures accompany his powerful paranoia and give the impression that Skipper has trained at the William Shatner school of acting. His tendency to clutch a flipper to his chest when upset gives one the permanent suspicion that he's suffering from some sort of heart condition.\n\nLoves My Alter Ego: He fell for Arlene (Marlene in disguise due to chlorine accident) and became kinda Stalker with a Crush.\n\nMagnificent Bastard: Let's see. He's well aware of what is happening in the entire zoo, His plans involving other people go very well and can think on the fly (including the one time that required him to flawlessly switch places with Julien without Julien separately disguising himself as Skipper), has succeeded in missions ranging from escaping a zoo to defeating a giant evil MP3 player flying over midtown with an evil dolphin at the helm, and everyone will go along with him despite hating him and him hating them. Yep, he fits.\n\nThe Nicknamer: He almost always refers to Julien as \"Ringtail,\" Mort as \"Sad Eyes\" and Max as \"moon cat.\"\n\nNoodle Incident: The Danes don't like him for some reason.\n\nAs one episode showed, it apparently had something to do with it ending in a fish-sword fight, among others.\n\nOfficer and a Gentleman: Mostly Officer.\n\nPenguin Non Grata: As stated above, he can't set foot in Denmark due to Hans the Puffin making him Public Enemy Number One.\n\nProperly Paranoid: Sometimes. Other times, he wears the paranoia cap too long.\n\nHis tendency to overreact to situations new to him gets subverted in its own right: in one of the specials the show had, he and the other penguins get stuck in Hoboken's Zoo, which has all of their former villains reformed. Skipper's thoughts about this? He comes up with a plot about them being taken over by robot clones. He was right.\n\nKowalski\n\nThe team genius and gadgeteer, voiced by Jeff Bennett. Kowalski builds all of the crazy technology that the other penguins use (and quite a lot that they don't use) and helps come up with plans.\n\nTropes associated with Kowalski:\n\nBamboo Technology: Kowalski reguarly builds amazing things out of elastic bands, coffee cups, lollipop sticks and duct tape.\n\nBi the Way: He dated a female dolphin once, but in \"Pet Peeved\" he shouts out \"I love you\" to Skipper when he is taken away.\n\nCannot Tell a Joke:\n\nHe has attempted to tell jokes since that episode... but they tend to fall flat.\n\nCaptain Obvious: \"Kowalski, report!\" Followed by Kowalski making a blatantly obvious statement.\n\nDeadpan Snarker: He has his moments of this.\n\nFoot Focus: In one episode, he makes particular notice of Marlene's right foot being white… while examining it with a magnifying glass.\n\nFor Science!: He is this trope incarnate.\n\nFour-Temperament Ensemble: The Melancholic.\n\nGadgeteer Genius: The team's primary source of Homemade Inventions.\n\nHomemade Inventions: His specialty.\n\nI Have No Idea What I'm Doing: Practically his Catch Phrase.\n\nIron Butt Monkey\n\nThe Lancer\n\nMad Scientist: A more low-key version, but still as mad as it can get.\n\nMagic Versus Science: Is extremely skeptical of anything with a 'supernatural' bent. Can, however, be convinced of its veracity if the problem persists long enough.\n\nOnce attempted to deny magic when it worked in an episode. He fails miserably.\n\nNerds Are Sexy: Arguably, he's the one with the most fans.\n\nNever Learned to Read\n\nNice Job Breaking It, Hero: The things he does For Science! sometimes result in this, such as his Kick the Dog moment in \"Friend-in-a-Box\" (taking the circuit board from Mort's video game) that earns him a What the Hell, Hero? from the others.\n\nNumber Two: With the rank of Lieutenant, when Skipper goes AWOL, Kowalski does his best to take charge.\n\nSubverted; he feels terribly lost without Skipper around, and even had to ask once if the remaining wanted to hear his options.\n\nPhrase Catcher: In early episodes, Skipper would often say \"Kowalski, options.\" or \"Kowalski, report.\" to him. This catch phrase has cropped up again halfway through season 2.\n\nRed Oni, Blue Oni: The blue to Rico's red.\n\nShorter Means Smarter: Inverted, as he's the tallest of the four.\n\nThe Smart Guy\n\nSniff Sniff Nom: His usual method of handling evidence, including chameleon footprints and a strand of King Julien's fur.\n\nRico\n\nThe big, dumb guy of the team, voiced by John Dimaggio. Usually, he speaks in short grunts, but his speech has become a little more coherent in later episodes of the series. Rico's main job is to spit up any sort of device that the other penguins need. Look closely and see that Rico actually has a scar over his beak, possibly from too much hacking up of stuff.\n\nTropes associated with Rico:\n\nAllergic to Love: In one episode, it's stated that he has \"mushy love sensitivity.\"\n\nAnti-Hero: Type III. Lethal, like Skipper.\n\nAx Crazy: Rico really loves Stuff Blowing Up and anything else that's destructive.\n\nTaken to the extreme in \"Kaboom and Kabust\"; the other three penguins have to constantly keep him under control (which is why they almost never let Rico explode things,) otherwise Rico loses it completely and destroys everything he can find.\n\nThe Big Guy: He's a bit sturdier than the other three.\n\nBi the Way: Lots of characters suggest this, but as well as having a toy doll girlfriend, Rico probably has the most moments of being attracted to the other penguins.\n\nChainsaw Good: As Private said in one episode, \"Oh, Rico! Chainsaw's Your Answer to Everything!\"\n\nDumb Muscle: The episode \"Friend In A Box\" has Kowalski make a mind-reading device. When the other two penguins are disgusted with Kowalski (and he with himself), Rico thinks only \"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiish\". When the other two penguins are proud of him, Rico still thinks, \"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish\". There are many other examples of Rico not being too bright...\n\nFlanderization: In the movies, the only thing Rico ever spits up is a paper clip. Somehow, this got magnified to him being a Stomach of Holding. Not that this is a bad thing - on the contrary it's hilarious.\n\nAdmittedly in the second movie Rico does start pulling other things - like a switchblade, for example - out of nowhere, and then putting them away again, and regurgitation is as good a reason as any. But nothing particuarly lol-worthy comes up - it's still majorly flanderised.\n\nA recent promo for the third movie has him smoothly vomiting up a match. Maybe they are starting to take cues from the show?\n\nFour-Temperament Ensemble: The Sanguine.\n\nHo Yay: \"Kaboom and Kabust\" very blatantly ships him with King Julien.\n\nIntelligible Unintelligible: At times, his speech can be understood fairly easily, especially in later episodes. Either way, if what he's saying is important to the plot, the other penguins will usually provide some sort of translation.\n\nLove Makes You Crazy: Or crazier. See \"Hello, Dollface\" or \"Kaboom and Kabust\".\n\nNightmare Fetishist: Rico is perfectly happy with things that give the other penguins nightmares. Like serenely munching away on popcorn while watching a brutal Nature Documentary with penguins getting gobbled up by leopard seals. And when Kowalski and Private are clearly horrified/nauseated at Skipper's broken flipper in \"I Was a Penguin Zombie,\" Rico looks… a little too interested.\n\nIn \"Roger Dodger\", as Roger is being pummeled offscreen by the rats, Rico stares at said beatdown, a blank smile on his face, his left eye twitching, and licks his beak at the end.\n\nOverly Long Tongue: Possibly concealed within the Stomach of Holding most of the time.\n\nPerson of Mass Destruction: So very much.\n\nRed Oni, Blue Oni; The red to Kowalski's blue.\n\nStomach of Holding: Exaggerated; he can spit up almost anything he or the other penguins need. In one episode, Mort requires an elevator to get to the bottom of his stomach to remove a bomb.\n\nToo Kinky to Torture: In \"Needle Point\", after Rico gets his shot, he actually doesn't seem to mind the pain too much, scooching his butt around on the floor. Or perhaps he just likes comforting the pain. Either way he looks really kinky.\n\nTrademark Favorite Food: Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiish!\n\nPrivate\n\nThe youngest member of the team. Voiced by James Patrick Stuart, he tends to be the most sane and logical — at least in comparison to Skipper's paranoid delusions, Kowalski's mad science, and Rico's love for explosions. Sometimes he's also got a little bit of childish naïveté. He has a tendency to get the sucker jobs.\n\nTropes associated with Private:\n\nAdorkable: There seems to be an in-universe consensus on this, with both Skipper and Kowalski reassuring him of being \"Adorable!\" on separate occasions. They also use this trait as a tactic once in awhile, and it even features as a plot point in one of the episodes, wherein he becomes jealous that his \"title\" has been handed over to someone else.\n\nBadass Adorable: His cuteness is actually weaponized in \"Cute-astrophe\".\n\nBeware the Nice Ones: Private can pull off a Moment of Awesome just as easily as any of the other penguins. Betraying his belief that all animals are basically good also serves as a Berserk Button for him.\n\nBishie Sparkle: Parodied, his weaponized cuteness includes a spontanously generated rainbow.\n\nCloser to Earth\n\nThe Conscience: Though usually holding the moral high ground, he also tends to be rather timid when first voicing his concerns, gradually losing his patience as Hilarity Ensues.\n\nCute Shotaro Boy\n\nCuteness Proximity: Honed to the point of becoming an incredibly effective weapon in \"Cute-astrophe\".\n\nDark and Troubled Past/The Gunslinger: Parodied when Private's Backstory is revealed in \"Mr. Tux\". He used to be a hardcore miniature golf player in Florida.\n\nFlorence Nightingale Effect: The cause of his crush on student nurse Shawna.\n\nFour-Temperament Ensemble: The Supine.\n\nThe Heart: Spelled out in \"Command Crisis.\"\n\nLove Makes You Crazy: His crush on Hospital Hottie Shawna in \"Love Hurts\" led him to deliberately injure himself. When the others threaten to come between them, he improvises a Wounded Penguin Gambit.\n\nNice Guy: According to Julien, he's the nicest guy in the zoo.\n\nSanity Ball: Most often, it's in his flippers. \"Skorca!\" inverts the situation by having him paranoid about the title character and the other penguins not believing him.\n\nSweet Tooth: See below.\n\nTrademark Favorite Food: Peanut butter winky. Also butterscotch lollipops.\n\nWhy Did It Have to Be Snakes?: He's afraid of badgers, and not fond of cockroaches.\n\nKing Julien XIII\n\nA ring-tailed lemur and (apparently self-proclaimed) king. Egomaniacal and ditzy, he's the closest thing the show has to a recurring antagonist. But at the same time, the penguins tolerate him when he's not being that big of a jerk. Julien \"rules\" over a small empire also comprising Maurice and Mort (see below). Voiced by Danny Jacobs.\n\nTropes associated with King Julien:\n\nAmbiguously Gay/Bi the Way: He likes to dance; he's obsessed with his own booty; he gives bedroom eyes; he's dressed in drag on occasion (though that may be even less significant to his actual sexuality than in Real Life crossdressers, as he normally wears nothing but his crown); despite his attempts at maintaining a ladies' man image, he was unfamiliar enough with females that he didn't know where mammal babies come from, and was disgusted to find out the truth (though that may just be simple Cloudcuckoolander status); and one episode blatantly ships him with Rico. Oh yeah, and he even said that he has a Girlfriend in Canada. On the other hand, he \"courted\" Marlene twice and has hit on Rico's Ms Perky doll. Wild Mass Guessing has also pegged him as Ambiguously Transgendered, thanks to the Animal Gender Bender mentioned below.\n\nTaken to its limits with Julien in \"It's About Time,\" when he sees Skipper and Private wrestling over the episode's MacGuffin and begins poking Maurice.\n\nAnimal Gender Bender: Real Life lemur groups are ruled by females. Then again, now he's in a zoo with only two other lemurs, both of which are male, and he's probably the nearest thing they've got. Also, when he claims Eggy is his, Kowalski says mammals can't lay eggs and asks if he's part platypus, without mentioning that males don't lay eggs either. (Then again, see above.)\n\nAnti-Hero: Type IV or Type V. The closest thing the show has to a recurring antagonist - but he also repeatedly helps out the penguins when it benefits him.\n\nAnything That Moves: Forget Ambiguously Gay or Bi the Way, it's easier to believe that Julien just loves to be admired, and doesn't care whether that admiration is sexual or otherwise.\n\nAttention Whore\n\nBerserk Button / Hates Being Touched: NO ONE MAY TOUCH THE ROYAL FEET!\n\n\"Friend-in-a-Box\" suggests that a Freudian Excuse may be involved. After Mort becomes obsessed with a portable video game, Julien goes out of his way to try and force Mort upon his feet, claiming that he wants to experience the joy of kicking Mort off. Eventually, he even goes so far as to beg Maurice and the penguins to pay attention to the royal feet.\n\nHe freaks out when no one does what he tells them on King Julien Day.\n\nBuffy-Speak: A normal part of his speech pattern, along with Malaproping; he frequently makes comments like \"What is up with the unbig tiny-littleness of my royal estate?\"\n\nThe Caligula: Parodied by his existence.\n\nCasting Gag: When the celebrity voice actors were replaced in the transition from the Madagascar films to the series, celebrity voice actor Sacha Baron Cohen (the voice of King Julien) was replaced by Danny Jacobs. Jacobs previously played an impersonation of Cohen's Borat character in Epic Movie.\n\nClingy Jealous King: Thanks to his believing that It's All About Him, he quickly gets jealous when somebody/something else is getting the attention he thinks he deserves.\n\nHe also doesn't like that Marlene is crushing on Fred rather than him. He doesn't give a reason why this makes him so upset, other than that Marlene was \"in love with Julian\" the whole time before... which was another lie.\n\nDepartment of Redundancy Department: Part of King Julien's regular speech pattern.\n\nDude in Distress\n\nEvil Laugh: Not as amazing as other Nicktoons, but pretty close. Usually Played for Laughs, much like most of the tropes on this page.\n\nFat and Skinny: Skinny Julien is the silly one, and fat Maurice is the Straight Man.\n\nFlanderization: A bit more of a Jerkass than in the movies, but he still has his moments (such as saving Skipper's life in one episode). His dialect is also noticeably stronger.\n\nFriendly Enemy: To Skipper. The two spend most of their shared screentime arguing and generally being annoyed by each other, but Skipper will go out of his way to help Julien, and Julien has gone to Skipper to have his problems fixed. They were actually mistaken as 'BFF's by Skipper's Arch Nemesis Dr. Blowhole... and the other penguins said he had a point.\n\nIncidental Villain: Being a spoiled ego-maniacal control freak, he's the most common antagonist on the show, with his schemes often being the catalyst for larger plots or being the main threat of the episode. But, despite being something of a Jerkass, he is only casually disliked by the rest of the cast. The other characters tolerate him when he's not doing anything antagonistic, since he's not generally a bad guy, just a spoiled jerk who occasionally screws with people to get his own way.\n\nIn-Series Nickname: \"Ringtail.\"\n\nIt's All About Me: He is the King, and so obviously is more important than any non-kingly animals, right?\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: He has his moments of being... less mean to the others.\n\nLarge Ham: With a side of Keet\n\nMalaproper: He is a bit of a word mangler. Examples include \"These stitions are very super!\" and \"No one will be sucking seed!\"\n\nMan Child: He has a tendency to throw childish tantrums, and on one occasion starts talking to his cuddly toys when he's depressed.\n\nNarcissist: To the point that he has distinct ho yay with a robot copy of himself.\n\nNakama: Among himself, Maurice and Mort. Arguably.\n\nNice Hat: His crown. He loves it a lot.\n\nSinging Voice Dissonance: Nothing major, but the end of his short Congaga song in 'Eclipsed' is rather impressive, especially considering his usual voice is not all that pleasant.\n\nSixth Ranger: When the squad is lacking in numbers, Julien often comes in as a substitute.\n\nThe Sociopath: King Julien displays far too many of the typical sociopathic qualities to ignore this trope.\n\nToken Evil Teammate\n\nUnsympathetic Comedy Protagonist\n\nUpper Class Twit\n\nWhat the Hell Is That Accent?: The same general quasi-African accent in the movie, only (as mentioned above) more exaggerated.\n\nWholesome Crossdresser: He dressed as a cheerleader in the episode \"Miracle On Ice\" and was jealous of Skipper's \"pretty pink bow\" in \"Miss Understanding\". The \"wholesome\" is debateable, but his un-wholesome characteristics are not related directly to the crossdressing.\n\nMaurice\n\nAn aye-aye who serves as King Julien's right hand man and advisor, although Julien rarely follows his advice. Although he seems easily annoyed by Julien's antics, Maurice isn't above saving his life. Voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson.\n\nTropes associated with Maurice:\n\nThe Big Guy: See Fat and Skinny, above.\n\nCloser to Earth: He is easily the sanest of the three lemurs.\n\nFour-Fingered Hands: A strange aversion. Maurice has five fingers/toes, yet Julien and Mort each have four.\n\nFunny Animal Anatomy: This is what a real aye-aye looks like. Eek.\n\nPuss in Boots: Has shades of this. At times, it seems that he really doesn't want to be part of Julien's world, but for some reason he stays faithful.\n\nServile Snarker\n\nMort\n\nA mouse lemur who is also part of Julien's nakama. He is pretty much there to be the victim of physical comedy, although Marlene in particular seems to care for him. Voiced by Andy Richter.\n\nTropes associated with Mort:\n\nBadass Adorable: Although small, dumb and pathetic, he's shown to be capable of beating Skipper at arm wrestling. Another episode has him uprooting trees.\n\nBerserk Button: Not surprisingly, King Julien's feet, as indicated by his reaction to being separated from them.\n\nThe Chew Toy: To the point where he's declared too dumb to feel pain. Lampshaded in one episode, where he says, \"Yay, I'm expendable!\"\n\nCloudcuckoolander\n\nDisability Superpower: In \"Sting Operation\", it's revealed that he's literally too stupid to feel pain.\n\nThe Ditz:\n\nFearless Fool: See above.\n\nFeel No Pain: Also see above.\n\nFoot Focus: Mort is crazy over King Julien's feet. One could argue that he just likes feet in general; when Julien and Skipper trade places for one episode, Mort glomps Skipper's feet and is fascinated by their webbing.\n\nIn-Series Nickname: \"Sad Eyes\".\n\nOlder Than They Look: Word of God is that he's actually the lemur equivalent of a thirty-five-year-old. Mouse lemurs simply look like babies their whole lives.\n\nPaste Eater:\n\nRidiculously Cute Critter\n\nSmall Annoying Creature\n\nTagalong Kid: Quite often.\n\nTeam Pet: He's either Tagalong Kid, this or both.\n\nWhat the Hell Is That Accent?: A completely unidentifiable one. It usually comes across as heavily warped Baby Talk.\n\nYandere: Mort is quite devoted to King Julien, and not just to the royal feet.\n\nMason and Phil\n\nA pair of chimpanzees. Mason is a stuffy British-accented one (voiced by Conrad Vernon), while Phil is mute and communicates only through sign language.\n\nTropes associated with Mason and Phil:\n\nDivergent Character Evolution: Thanks to greater focus on them (compared to their One-Scene Wonder status in the original movies), Mason's Neat Freak nature and Phil's relaxed and slovenly behavior have been revealed and developed.\n\nFake Brit: Mason's VA is American, and according to Private, Mason himself is secretly Canadian.\n\nFour-Fingered Hands: Averted for the sake of Phil's sign language.\n\nNever Learned to Read: Mason is illiterate. Phil, on the other hand, is the penguin's go-to translator, with Mason translating his signing.\n\nOdd Couple: Phil is a total slob, much to Neat Freak Mason's chagrin.\n\nRoad Apples: Mason mentions throwing poo a couple of times, though this is never seen on-screen.\n\nShown Their Work: Phil's sign language is completely accurate.\n\nThe Speechless: Phil.\n\nMarlene\n\nA female otter who tolerates the penguins. Playful and kind, she tries to see the best in others and is one of the only characters who cares for Mort's well-being. Voiced by Nicole Sullivan.\n\nTropes associated with Marlene:\n\nThe Chick\n\nExpy: Arguably, she's one for Gloria the hippo and/or Alex the lion.\n\nHartman Hips: At the very least, she's obviously more curvy than your average otter.\n\nJekyll and Hyde: If she leaves the zoo grounds, she becomes feral. Dee Bradley Baker voices her feral side.\n\nPlayful Otter: Love of clams? Check. Playful and cute? Check.\n\nThe Smurfette Principle: She's the only protagonistic female character.\n\nWomen Are Wiser: In comparison to the penguins. Often overlaps with Only Sane Woman.\n\nAlice\n\nVoiced by Mary Scheer. She is a zookeeper who doesn't seem to care too much for her job, and expresses annoyance at tour groups.\n\nTropes associated with Alice:\n\nGreen Eyed Red Head\n\nJerkass: And she usually suffers for it.\n\nDr. Blowhole\n\nA mad scientist and primary antagonist to Skipper. At first, he was only mentioned in passing by Skipper, leading to Marlene's belief that he didn't exist. The half-hour \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\" showed him to be real. Voiced by Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nTropes associated with Dr. Blowhole:\n\nActor Allusion: A villain played by Neil Patrick Harris causes the cast to start singing against their will? Where have we seen that before?\n\nHe sings \"Brand New Plan\", which contains several shout outs to another Villain Song Neil Patrick Harris has sung.\n\nArch Enemy: To Skipper.\n\nBigger Bad: Is mentioned as Skipper and the Penguins' Arch Enemy, but rarely appears or has a large effect on the series.\n\nBadass Bookworm: He might be an extremely intelligent scientist who doesn't fight often, but when we actually see him fight, he's able to go toe to toe with Skipper in a prolonged fight.\n\nDisproportionate Retribution: He tried to flood the world in revenge for being used as a show dolphin.\n\nFriendly Playful Dolphin: Subverted.\n\nEye Beams: Can fire a laser from his cybernetic eye.\n\nGiant Enemy Crab: Has lobster henchmen, and also made Crome Claw, a giant lobster with a metal claw.\n\nGenre Savvy: He's smart enough to know to NOT leave his enemies in a Death Trap and then leave the room, he stays to watch unless it'd kill him as well.\n\nGood Scars, Evil Scars: Has a scar over his right eye that's just barely visable under the metal plate covering it.\n\nHoist by His Own Petard: Ultimately has his memory erased by his own machine.\n\nLarge Ham\n\nMad Scientist\n\nSapient Cetaceans\n\nTailfin Walking: He stands on his tailfins on an electric scooter.\n\nVerbal Tic: He has habit of pronouncing penguins as \"peng-you-ens\". According to Kowalski, he probably does it just to tick them off. While not exactly verbal, he also has a habit of having his computer dramatically announce the names of his creates.\n\nVile Villain Saccharine Show: He fits it to an E.\n\nVillain Song: Get's a few in \"Doctor Blowhole Strikes Back\" (It Makes Sense in Context). It's actually a plot point that he gets the best songs. Most noteable being \"Brand New Plan\", which is a pretty straight up Villain Song. Helps he's voiced by Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nWe Have Reserves\n\nWhere Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?: Kowalski complains about bad guys always getting the coolest stuff, but it's never explained where he gets the resources required for them.\n\nXanatos Speed Chess: He normally has a plan to begin with, but is far from incapable of improvising on the fly. Refrenced in \"Brand New Plan\", where he points out that, despite things having not gone as he planned, it'll work out perfectly for him and makes up a new plan on the fly.\n\nFred\n\nA not-too-bright squirrel who lives in the park. When the penguins leave the zoo, they often cross paths with him. Voiced by Fred Stoller.\n\nTropes associated with Fred:\n\nThe Ditz\n\nEverythings Nuttier With Squirrels: Averted, as he's both dumb and pretty mellow.\n\nLiteral-Minded: Spelled out in one episode where Marlene tries to date him. She asks him to show her the town and he answers by pointing and saying, \"That way.\"\n\nJoey\n\nAn ill-tempered, violent kangaroo with a stereotypical Australian accent. Antagonist to both the penguins and the lemurs most of the time.\n\nTropes associated with Joey:\n\nAnimal Gender Bender: He has a pouch.\n\nAustralian Accent: He shares a voice actor with British-accented Private.\n\nKangaroos Represent Australia: Inverted - he's a maniac who makes things worse.\n\nHair-Trigger Temper: He'll beat up other animals just for being in his habitat... and deliberately keep them there so that he can beat them up some more if they try to escape.\n\nI Am Not Weasel: Joey gets angry at anyone who refers to him as a wallaby.\n\nStupid Evil: When fighting the \"skorca\", he beats off the penguins first because he doesn't want them to win against it. Skipper calls him out on it, but Joey dismisses him on the grounds that \"Joey doesn't share\".\n\nThird Person Person: Lampshaded in \"Kanga Management\".\n\nThe Worf Effect: Officer X and Eggy have pulled one on him.\n\nMax\n\nA stray cat whom the penguins first meet in a failed attempt to fly to the moon. Max has reappeared in several episodes, often seeking help from the penguins. Voiced by Wayne Knight.\n\nTropes associated with Max:\n\nThe Cameo: He appears for about two seconds in \"The Helmet\".\n\nIn-Series Nickname: \"Moon Cat\".\n\nMismatched Eyes: One is green and one is blue.\n\nOfficer X\n\nAn animal control officer who has made repeated, failed attempts to capture the penguins while they're out on the town. After getting thwarted by the penguins in one episode, he loses his job and reappeared later on as an exterminator and then again as a zookeeper. Voiced by Cedric Yarbrough.\n\nTropes associated with Officer X:\n\nBadass Beard: before it was ripped out by tape thanks to the penguins.\n\nBald of Evil\n\nCool Shades\n\nNo Name Given:\n\nReal Men Wear Pink: His exterminator uniform is pink.\n\nScary Black Man\n\nWhat Do You Mean It's Not Awesome?: He could give Skipper lessons in this.\n\nWhy Do You Keep Changing Jobs?: Because of the penguins, of course!\n\nThe Worf Effect: Pulls one on Rico and one on Joey.\n\nRat King\n\nA large, muscular sewer rat with a heavy East-Side accent and a tendency to say \"Dude!\" and \"Awesome!\" a lot, who often antagonizes the penguins. Voiced by Diedrich Bader.\n\nTropes associated with Rat King:\n\nDumb Muscle\n\nGullible Lemmings: In \"Rat Fink\", he blindly follows what he believes to be the true rat king, despite the Paper-Thin Disguise. He only becomes confused when the invasion plan is put into action.\n\nMooks: The other sewer rats who follow him.\n\nObfuscating Stupidity: He and the rats pretend not to know the rules of ice hockey before the penguins challenge him to a game. It turns out they were hustling the penguins, and the rats curb-stomp them.\n\nRodents of Unusual Size: Exaggerated; he's taller than the penguins. This is because he's a genetically modified lab rat.\n\nLarge and In Charge\n\nThe Worf Effect: He seems to exist only for the Penguins to have moments of awesome against him.\n\nYou Dirty Rat\n\nRoger\n\nA large, friendly alligator. Although the others are terrified of him at first, they grow to like him once they find that he is pacifistic and friendly. Eventually he moves into a habitat in the zoo. Voiced by Richard Kind.\n\nTropes associated with Roger:\n\nAmbiguously Gay: A friendly, sensitive, soft-voiced alligator who wants to sing Broadway tunes and bake muffins to placate his enemies…\n\nChekhov's Gun: His singing in \"Roger Dodger\".\n\nDoes Not Know His Own Strength: When he's in a confined space with the penguins, he becomes a menace simply by turning around.\n\nGentle Giant: He has to undergo a mind-swap with Rico at one point because he's simply not aggressive, which makes him an easy target for the sewer rats.\n\nOut-of-Character Moment: He seems genuinely annoyed at Julien's pranking in the \"April Fools\" episode.\n\nReluctant Monster\n\nReptiles Are Abhorrent: Averted quite extremely; see above.\n\nBurt\n\nThe resident elephant at the zoo. Though normally an easygoing guy, he's easily annoyed by anyone messing with his food. But if you do manage to set him off...\n\nTropes associated with Burt:\n\nBeware the Nice Ones\n\nTrademark Favorite Food: Peanuts.\n\nLeonard\n\nA paranoid koala who first appears in \"Night and Dazed\". He is rather afraid of the penguins in their attempts to be nice to him, mainly because he's often the target of unintentional injury. Voiced by Dana Snyder.\n\nAustralian Accent: Strangely averted.\n\nNot So Different: as seen in \"Kanga Management\". Because he's nocturnal and Joey's diurnal, Joey is angered by Leonard always doing something when trying to sleep...but at the end, they bond when they realize that they both hate the penguins.\n\nProperly Paranoid: You would be too, if the penguins accidentally blew up your habitat.\n\nEggy\n\nAn adorable little duckling whose egg came under the penguins' care during \"Parental Egg-Stinct\". After hatching and being returned to Mama Duck, he showed an innate talent for Skipper's style of leadership.\n\nTropes associated with Eggy:\n\nAll Your Powers Combined: Thanks to being cared and trained by the penguins while still an egg. At the end, Julien teaches him how to dance, resulting in Eggy talking like Julien (see Buffy-Speak above).\n\nBadass Adorable\n\nBuffy-Speak: He copies Julien's idiosyncratic speech patterns.\n\nDefeat Means Friendship: With King Julien.\n\nTroubling Unchildlike Behaviour: How Mama Duck views his obsession with combat and commando operations.\n\nTyke Bomb: Leads to Defusing the Tykebomb in \"Hard Boiled Eggy\".\n\nKitka\n\nA falcon who crash-landed in the zoo, setting off the events of \"The Falcon and the Snow Job\" and serving as Skipper's Temporary Love Interest as he fought to clear her good name.\n\nTropes associated with Kitka:\n\nCarnivore Confusion: Directly acknowledged and the root of the others' distrust. She tries to allay concerns by swearing not to eat anyone in the zoo. She didn't know that they also had friends outside the zoo, like Fred.\n\nClear Their Name\n\n\"Falling in Love\" Montage\n\nGirl of the Week\n\nLove At First Sight\n\nShip Sinking: Didn't make any impact on the Skipper/Marlene fanbase. Possibly lampshaded by Skipper; even he admits that it wasn't working out.\n\nHans\n\nA puffin who has a dark history with Skipper. Whatever happened in Denmark is between Skipper, him and the Danes.\n\nTropes associated with Hans:"
