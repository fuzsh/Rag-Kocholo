        "text": "The new clip sees the Penguin dancing with his mother, who has been in Arkham Asylum. She tells him: \"I've been rehabilitated.\"\n\nThe trailer later sees him come face to face with Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) – although we're expecting a different version of the character to the one seen in the comics.\n\nBased on the character created for DC by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, whose real name is Oswald Cobblepot, the show will chronicle the villain's rise to power in the Gotham criminal underworld.\n\nMore like this\n\nHere's everything we know so far about The Penguin!\n\nThe Penguin will be released on Thursday 19th September. Episodes will air weekly, with the season finale arriving on 7th November.\n\nIn the US, the show will air on HBO and on streaming platform Max, while in the UK, fans can watch via Sky and NOW.\n\nThe Penguin was first developed in September 2021, with the series receiving an order from HBO following the success of The Batman.\n\nFilming began in March 2023 but was halted due to the Hollywood labour disputes. Production resumed in November and finished in February 2024.\n\nWhen the series was first announced, Farrell said: \"The world that Matt Reeves created for The Batman is one that warrants a deeper gaze through the eyes of Oswald Cobblepot.\n\n\"I couldn’t be more excited about continuing this exploration of Oz as he rises through the darkened ranks to become The Penguin. Will be good to get him back on the streets of Gotham for a little madness and a little mayhem.\"\n\nShowrunner Lauren LeFranc said: \"I have long been a fan of the world of The Batman, and Matt’s film is such a powerful and bold entry into the canon.\n\n\"I am excited and humbled to continue telling stories in the grimy world of Gotham City – and what better excuse to channel my inner villain than to tell the story of Oswald Cobblepot? I am thrilled to work with Colin, Matt, Dylan, 6th & Idaho, Warners, and HBO Max as we work to bring this story to the screen.\"\n\nThe Penguin cast: Who will star in HBO series?\n\nHere's what we know so far about the cast of The Penguin:\n\nColin Farrell as Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot / Penguin:\n\nCristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone / Hangman\n\nRhenzy Feliz as Victor Aguilar\n\nMichael Kelly as Johnny Vitti:\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo as Nadia Maroni\n\nDeirdre O'Connell as Francis Cobb\n\nClancy Brown as Salvatore Maroni\n\nJames Madio as Milos Grapa\n\nScott Cohen as Luca Falcone\n\nMichael Zegen as Alberto Falcone\n\nTheo Rossi as Julian Rush: A doctor\n\nCarmen Ejogo as Eve Karlo\n\nFrançois Chau as TBC\n\nDavid H. Holmes as TBC\n\nCraig Walker as TBC\n\nJared Abrahamson as TBC\n\nMark Strong as TBC\n\nWhat will happen in The Penguin?\n\nThe Penguin will explore Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot's rise to power in Gotham's criminal underworld following the events of The Batman.\n\nFarrell also gave us a clue as to what to expect when he told RadioTimes.com: \"What an adventure. I never have any idea what any of this s**t is going to turn out to be, that we do over the years. You just keep your fingers crossed and do the best you can…\n\n\"It’s dark, The Penguin. It’s so dark. I’m so glad to be done with it, and I loved it, but man I was ready not to sit in the makeup chair anymore when we finished.\"\n\nWhen is The Penguin set?\n\nThe Penguin will pick up one week after the events of The Batman.\n\nHow many episodes will there be of The Penguin?\n\nThe Penguin will consist of eight episodes, released weekly.\n\nIs there a trailer for The Penguin?\n\nYes!
