        "text": "This article is officially part of both the movies' and the series' timelines\n\nPrivate is a main character in the Madagascar franchise.\n\nHe is the third member of the four Penguins.\n\nPrivate is voiced by Christopher Knights in the film and James Patrick Stuart in the TV series\n\nEarly life\n\nBefore he was born, Private as an egg was presumably abandoned by his parents. According to Operation Penguin, Private's father's name is Sam Fishy; however, his mother's name is unknown. His egg was eventually buried in a snowbank and began rolling down a hill, knocking down three penguin children, Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico. Skipper, not willing to let a defenseless egg get smashed goes to save it but ends up making it fall down a cliff.\n\nThe penguins, growing worried when they see the penguin egg endangered by a group of leopard seals, all fall down the cliff and enter the danger zone on the ship. Rico swallows the egg whole and carries it to safety with the rest of his brothers.\n\nShortly after they escape the leopard seals, Skipper accidentally slaps the egg's shell, which activates Private being hatched. Private greets them and inquires if they are his family. Before Skipper responds, child Kowalski answers that Private has no family and that they are all going to die. However, Skipper instead slaps Kowalski and tells baby Private that they're all the family the baby penguin has. They adopt him as their baby brother and name him Private.\n\nPersonality\n\nOut of all the penguins, Private is a down-to-earth person and tries to get out the non-violent way of things, unlike his fellow penguins. Sometimes he can get impatient i. e. in one episode, Private starts to inhabit cabin fever while stuck with Mort but does get out of it when Mort eats all of the food and they can escape.\n\nHe mostly starts picking up several of the older penguins' habits, especially from Skipper, as he becomes more aggressive as the series goes on. Still, though, Private cares and loves his family until the end of the earth, choosing his friends over love and having full faith in his brothers when Private is held captive by Dave. He also seems more friendly than the others and has harbored paternal instincts toward younger life forms. Mostly this was shown in \"Paternal Egg Stinct\" when his brothers had threatened the unhatched Eggy with \"pushing too hard.\"\n\nMost of the penguins are protective over Private, despite being a valued member of their group. However, it was most likely because Private had been endangered as an egg. They usually tend to cover his eyes from something they deem inappropriate, or cover his ears when Skipper uses his \"angry words\".\n\nAppearance\n\nPrivate is a short, young penguin. He is about nine later ten years old (revealed in the film) and younger than all his other brothers. He has blue eyes yellow webbed feet, and a orange beak. Private has black wings that cover his whole front down to his feet.\n\nAppearances\n\nTV series\n\nFilm\n\nMadagascar\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa\n\nMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\n\nPenguins of Madagascar: The Movie\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nPenguins of Madagascar: The Movie\n\nDuring the battle at the Aquarium in Shanghai, China, Dave kidnapped Private along with the other penguins. After witnessing Dave the full power of the Medusa serum, he accidentally alerted Dave of his presence by yelling \"crikey,\" a term Private used earlier when he and the other penguins were initially captured by their one time. Though discovered, Private swears to Dave that when his brothers come, they'll bring about disaster to his operation. Dave realizes that Private's brothers are coming to them and decides to use it to his advantage. When Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico are captured as well. However, Private escapes before using the paperclip that he swallowed earlier\n\nCentered episodes\n\nSeason 1\n\nMask of the Raccoon\n\nUntouchable\n\nThe Penguin Stays In the Picture\n\nTruth Ache\n\nSkorca\n\nSeason 2\n\nThe Red Squirrel\n\nStop Bugging Me\n\nMr. Tux\n\nLove Hurts\n\nA Visit From Uncle Nigel\n\nArch-Enemy\n\nSeason 3\n\nOperation: Lunacorn Apocalypse\n\nAntics on Ice\n\nShowdown on Fairway 18\n\nA Kipper for Skipper-\n\nHigh Moltage\n\nPrivate and the Winky Factory\n\nOther centric episodes\n\nDanger Wears A Cape (shared with Kowalksi, Rico\n\nPaternal Egg-Stinct (shared with Julien,\n\nTangled in the Web (shared with Julien and Marlene\n\nConcrete Jungle Survival (shared with the lemurs)\n\nStop Bugging Me- (shared with Rico)\n\nBadger Pride (shared with Marlene)\n\nNight and Dazed (shared with Leonard)\n\nWishful Thinking- (shared with Julien)\n\nThe Officer X Factor (shared with Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski)\n\nOperation: Break Speare (shared with Julien and Skipper,)\n\nCute-Astrophe (shared with Skipper)\n\nThe Hoboken Surprise (shared with Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski)\n\nThe Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole (shared with Skipper, King Julien, Kowalski, Mort, Maurice, Rico)\n\nOperation: Good Deed (shared with Rico, Skipper, Kowalski)\n\nWhen the Chips are Down (shared with Mort)\n\nOur Man in Grrfurjiclestan (shared with Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski)\n\nOperation: Antarctica (shared with Skipper, Julien)\n\nOperation: Big Blue Marble Kowalski, Skipper, King Julien, Rico)\n\nSmotherly Love (shared with Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski)\n\nStreet Smarts (shared with Mort and King Julien)\n\nGoodnight and Good Chuck (shared with Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski)\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Private/Relationships\n\nCupid\n\n(Love interest in Merry Madagascar) A female reindeer whom Private immediately falls in love with upon seeing her.

Before an actual romance, Private and Cupid depart, but not before saying goodbye to each other.
