        "text": "Adelie penguins near Casey research station have been studied for the last 60 years.\n\nSeabird Conservation Ecologist, Dr Colin Southwell: \"It's a long time series, there aren't many time series in Antarctica that long. Over that time the regional population has increased by a factor of 6. So it used to be about 30,000 breeding pairs, and now it's almost 200,000 breeding pairs. That's nearly half a million breeding birds. So it's a very large population in the Windmill Islands – the third largest in East Antarctica.\"\n\nThe penguin population grew rapidly from the 1960s to the 1990s – the question is, has that continued?\n\nColin Southwell: \"We also realised that some populations were still going gangbusters, in terms of growing at very fast rates; and some were flatlining, so they were not changing at all. What we've found is that the populations that are stable don't have much breeding habitat left. So they've expanded in their growth in previous years, and virtually filled that habitat, so they can't grow any more. We've found that the populations that have been increasing quickly have a lot of habitat left.\"\n\nMany of the Windmill Islands near Casey station are 'penguin heaven'.\n\nThere's space to lay eggs, surrounded by krill to eat with not too much sea ice.\n\nColin Southwell: \"Good breeding habitat on land is ice-free land, snow-free land, not too steep, not flat – because flat gets too wet – and with lots of pebbles so they can build their nests.\"\n\n40,000 breeding Adelies live on Shirley Island alone, in less than one square kilometre.\n\nColin Southwell: \"So we can count them from helicopters flying overhead; taking photos, and counting the penguins from the photos; or, if we can get to an island, we can do a direct count from the ground. It's not a trivial task. There are tens and hundreds of thousands of penguins in this population, so it's a very difficult and time-consuming thing to do.\"\n\nAs well as field work, automatic cameras can spy on the penguins all year round.\n\nThat's exactly what Madi did, studying 45,000 photos from Adelie colonies.\n\nInstitute for Marine and Antarctic Studies Honours student, Madison McLatchie: \"I looked at 10 photos per day for every season, and I did 10 seasons at the 5 camera sites.\"\n\nAdelie penguins use rocks to build their nests.\n\nMadi McLatchie: \"Stealing rocks from other penguins, that's a major thing that they do. They'll just go take rocks, no permission asked, and then take that back to their nest. Otherwise, they'll just go scrounging for rocks around the colony as well.\"\n\nFrom the photos, she recorded the breeding success of 450 Adelie penguin nests.\n\nThe more rocks in the nest, the better the chance of one or more chicks surviving.\n\nMadi McLatchie: \"So the higher the nest's off the ground, the more likely they are to be away from the snow cover and the moisture on the ground.\"\n\nIt seems obvious, but the results were a surprise.\n\nMadi McLatchie: \"We weren't expecting that nest structure would have such a big impact on breeding success, because that was a relatively new finding. Only a few people prior to me have found that.\"\n\nKnowing about nests is all part of a bigger picture beyond the cameras.\n\nColin Southwell: \"We've been focusing on Adelie penguins all this time, but the penguins are part of a larger ecosystem. What we're trying to understand is how that larger ecosystem works.\"\n\nThey're indebted to the people who keep the cameras going and collect the images."
