        "text": "Pretty, Silly & Pretty Darn Silly\n\nLet me start this review with a strange matter of opinion: this is one of very few major motion pictures I’m aware of that really does nothing better than the (much lower budgeted) television series of the same name. Even more surprising is that this may not even be the fault of the film itself so much as a testament to the fact that the TV show did a lot of things right.\n\nThat being said, Penguins of Madagascar is the 92-minute 2014 DreamWorks film that managed to flip a $132-million budget into $373-million at the box office. No bad at all for any film, much less the fourth in a franchise and a spin-off of lesser characters at that.\n\nSaid franchise of course would be Madagascar and while the quartet of penguins have primarily played a fairly minor role in the grand scheme of madness that is the series (King Julien- need I say more?), the truth is DreamWorks has been steadily grooming them for stardom ever since the 2005 release of the first Madagascar. In fact in the beginning Penguins of Madagascar was planned to be a direct-to-DVD affair set for a 2009 release. Eventually the plan changed to a theatrical release, the budget continued to climb and finally a mere 5 years after the initial proposed date, Penguins hit the big screen on November 26th of 2014.\n\nThe story here, or what tries to pass as one anyway, follows Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (Conrad Vernon) and Private (Christopher Knights) as they unravel a penguin-plucking caper head up by an octopus named Dave (John Malkovich). Fortunately they end up enlisting the help (competing with) an elite arctic animal operative group known as North Wind along the way.\n\nWhile this may sound like a pretty reasonable story summary when written out as such, the actual experience of watching the film plays out much closer to a series of visually-rich, physics-defying sequences loosely stitched together in the hopes of a plot manifesting.\n\nThis shouldn’t come as a surprise of course keeping in mind that the Madagascar films themselves have degenerated plot-wise into chase movies. Over-the-top, wise cracking minor characters can’t really be expected to bring the dramatic appeal after all.\n\nSo what you do get instead is 92-minutes of action, puns, gags, action, spoofs of other films, action. Individuals seeking depth would certainly be better off looking into something from Pixar; Penguins of Madagascar is a visual feast with explosions aplenty and little more. Jokes happen in such rapid-fire succession that you often find yourself taking in the next one before fully comprehending the last.\n\nKids of course should delight at the plentiful visual gags, gorgeous textures and fast-moving plot but adults have to be in the right state of mind going in to take anything away from this piece (other than a headache). That state of mind is one of detachment from convention and a willingness to let the loose plot just carry them where it will. Unlike the monotony underlying Madagascar 3’s plot development, Penguins doesn’t even bother hiding from the fact that it is nothing more than a silly chase movie. In fact, it almost embraces it.\n\nIndividuals looking for a bit of pop cultural satire will likely take note of the fact that the movie literally opens poking fun of Werner Herzog’s documentary style complete with the real Herzog lending his voice to the gag.\n\nI may be in the minority here but I would go as far as to say the voice cast of the Nickelodeon animated series of the same name has a more natural character dynamic than that of the film. In it Skipper is also played by Tom McGrath but Rico is voiced by John DiMaggio, Jeff Benett does Kowalski and Private is performed by James Patrick Stuart. If you’ve never seen the show, the liberties taken with Rico make the character much more endearing and Kowalski is played with a dryness very reminiscent of John O’Hurley. It works wonderfully.\n\nIn conclusion, going into Penguins of Madagascar requires a very similar approach to Universal/ Illumination’s 2015 hit Minions- expect a quick, nonsensical plot laced with popping visuals, precise camerawork, impeccable editing and high-quality animation. If you’re able to take anything else away from the piece, consider it a bonus."
