        "text": "A recent convo came up that put the canonicity of the Penguins of Madagascar TV series into question, whether or not it is canon to the events of the movie. And I am here to clear up that misconception. I don't have the screen-recording software able to catch all of my evidence, but I do have the exact timestamps and episode numbers to back them up.\n\nField Tripped:\n\nIn the episode Season 2 Episode 13 episode Field Tripped, at 1:43, the Penguins have this to say when a child whom they believe is a spy drops a brochure on Madagascar.\n\nPrivate: Skipper! He dropped this!\n\nSkipper: Junior has intel on Madagascar. How long has he been following us?\n\nThis confirms that the Penguins have been to Madagascar, tying into the events of the film.\n\nThe Return of the Revenge Of Dr. Blowhole:\n\nThis one is much easier. In the events of the episode, Skipper gets his mind wiped by Dr. Blowhole's Mind Jacker, and his subconscious creates a spirit guide to help him regain his memories. Eventually, it takes on the form of Alex the Lion from the Madagascar films, who remarks that they used to be neighbors before \"a lot of crazy stuff happened\".\n\nApril Fools:\n\nJulien shows the Penguins a calendar which includes the month of \"Julianuary\", to which Mort replies that it is his favorite month. This is a connection in continuity to the \"Merry Madagascar\" special in which Julien calls Julienuary by name.\n\nThe Terror of Madagascar:\n\nThe plot revolves around a Baby Foosa (the predatory animals from the first movie) coming to the zoo. And Kowalski already has prior knowledge on the Foosa from the first film as shown in this scene.\n\nTranslation: The Foosas. Madagascar's most savage predators! Wild beasts that bite with flesh-shredding, bone-crushing jaws of doom! And that's just if they like you!\n\n(Note: This episode came out a good while after the third film came out, thus we can assume that the three films are already accepted into the same canon)\n\nSince the events of The Penguins of Madasgacar film take place directly after 3, I think it's safe to say that we have our timeline.\n\nOh and also All Hail King Julien is a prequel series and it ends with the Madagascar gang washing up on the island. So\n\nAll Hail King Julien -> Penguins Christmas Special -> Madagascar -> Merry Madagascar -> Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa -> Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted -> The Penguins of Madasgacar (Film) -> (The Penguins and Julien return to Central Park Zoo) -> The Penguins of Madagascar (Series)\n\nEdit: Strawman Argument Time!\n\nPeople like to bring up the statement from Tom McGrath that he likes to think it takes place in a parallel universe, but this statement was from all the way back in 2009 at its conception before all of the episodes above (which were all from either Season 2 or Season 3) connected it to the Madagascar continuity. It was for a single interview and it was not brought up since."
