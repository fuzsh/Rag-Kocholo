        "text": "The super-spy wannabes seize the big-screen spotlight for the first time with “Penguins of Madagascar,” a funny, frenetic and ultimately forgettable spin-off.\n\nAlthough they’ve had their own TV series since 2008, the zany but impressively coordinated team — fearless but clueless leader Skipper (voice of Tom McGrath); brains of the operation Kowlaski (Chris Miller); always hungry and mostly silent brute Rico (Conrad Vernon); and sweet-natured novice Private (Christopher Knights) — have been limited to a supporting role among the veritable menagerie of critter characters in the popular “Madagascar” movies. Not surprisingly, a little goes a long way when it comes to these wisecracking waterfowl, even if they get stellar support from franchise newcomers Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich.\n\nDreamWorks’ computer-animated romp starts with a flashback to Antarctica, where the hordes of marching penguins are so cute and cuddly that they are constantly surrounded by a documentary filmmaker (Werner Herzog, in one of the movie’s smartest moments) and his camera crew. The young Skipper, Kowalski and Rico break ranks to rescue a runaway egg that hatches into Private, cementing a dynamic in which the team’s youngest member gets no respect from his cohorts.\n\nFlashing forward, the story picks up where “Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted” left off, with the penguins so desperate to escape the omnipresent ditty “Afro Circus” that they shoot themselves out of a cannon and into their own adventure.\n\nThey are intercepted by a villainous octopus named Dave (Malkovich), who resents penguins because flocks of the adorable birds, including the “Madagascar” foursome, have overshadowed him at zoos and aquariums around the world. With an octopus army at his disposal and an eccentric human scientist alter ego in place, he starts kidnapping penguins from across the globe. He plans to use his mysterious green invention, the Medusa serum, to exact his revenge on the aquatic birds.\n\nThe penguin heroes also encounter a deep-pocketed, tech-savvy covert team named North Wind. The elite interspecies task force — gung ho leader Classified (Cumberbatch), a gray wolf; smart and sexy intelligence analyst Eva (Annet Mahendru), a snowy owl; mouthy explosives expert Short Fuse (Ken Jeong), a harp seal; and softhearted heavy Corporal (Peter Stormare), a Norwegian polar bear — is dedicated to rescuing animals who can’t help themselves. To them, that includes the penguins, to the outrage of Skipper, who believes he and his pals are espionage experts.\n\nAs expected, both crews are determined to thwart Dave’s sinister scheme, and they have to learn to work together, even as Private keeps looking for a way to prove he should be treated as a valued member of Team Penguin.\n\nDirectors Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith keep the globe-trotting story barreling along at a frantic pace, zipping through nearly nonstop jokes and action sequences. For hyperactive kiddos, it’s all great fun, but for any adult who hasn’t consumed a bucket of caffeine, it’s almost as exhausting as it is entertaining.\n\nAlthough it sneaks in some clever and irreverent witticisms and send-ups, “Penguins of Madagascar” primarily plays to children instead of whole families. It mostly gets its laughs from goofy sight gags and groaner puns incorporating celebrity names.\n\nIt may not reach the artistic and creative heights of the “How to Train Your Dragon” or “Shrek” movies, but the spin-off should appeal to children along a fairly wide age spectrum, from tiny tots to tweens. It’s practically the perfect animated offering for Thanksgiving weekend, dishing up a quick 92 minutes of spy action and silly laughs that will get the family out of the house but will largely be forgotten by the time the pumpkin pie is served.\n\n— Brandy McDonnell,"
