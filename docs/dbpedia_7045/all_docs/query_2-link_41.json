        "text": "King Julien is a major character of the Madagascar franchise, the anti-hero of The Penguins of Madagascar, and the main protagonist of All Hail King Julien.\n\nHe is well-remembered for being a memorable comic relief as a hilarious leader for other lemurs who got character development and providing the \"Move It\" song, but sadly, he suffered from flanderization in the TV series The Penguins of Madagascar.\n\nPersonality\n\nHe fights with the penguins in some episodes. He is the penguins most powerful foe and ally. In some occasions, King Julien's vocabulary and grammar levels are sometimes shown to be even lower. In \"Lemur See, Lemur Do\", instead of saying \"most disappointing\" he says \"disappointiest\". Also, in \"Popcorn Panic\" he does not know that \"succeed\" is the opposite of \"fail\" and says it like \"suck seed\". Julien also seems to be very sensitive to a rejection of any kind, as seen especially in All King, No Kingdom. In Otter Gone Wild, he was upset at Marlene rejecting him. In \"Eclipsed\", he was horrified at the sky spirits' threat of never bringing the sun back, since he's so loyal to them. He expects appreciation and acceptance from everyone, but when he gets in trouble with the whole zoo, he begs for mercy even when he knows he deserves what he's given.\n\nBecause he is extremely conceited, selfish and rather dim-witted, Julien is a terrible king. It seems that he will only let people talk good about him. Julien could even be narcissistic in that way. But it has been referenced twice in the series that deep down, he mainly wants his friends to stay by his side.\n\nHowever, after the movie, Julien's dumb personality changed to a more serious personality because of Mort touching his feet or sometimes even worse than happen. For example, in \"Happy King Julien Day!\", Maurice has a flashback about King Julien's personality was changed to aggressive personality. In Miracle on Ice, Julien has become very enraged after the rat accidentally stepped on his feet and plucked at them. In Right Hand Man, when Maurice asking him to make Clemson his right-hand man, Julien became angry and yelled at him.\n\nWhy He Should Move It Move It Out of This Show\n\nNote: This only applies to his character in Nickelodeon's The Penguins of Madagascar TV show, not its 2014 movie version Penguins of Madagascar.\n\nHe is a selfish and idiotic jerk in the series, unlike the movies where he's not that smart but not really that big of a jerk either.\n\nHis carelessness once allowed an MP3 player to come to life and try to destroy the world!\n\nIn Gone in a Flash, he is shown stealing from Maurice constantly just because he thinks that his stuff belongs to the \"king\"!\n\nHe hardly ever gets punished for his actions, despite being an unlikable jerk, making him a Karma Houdini or even an Idiot Houdini.\n\nHe constantly bothers the penguins in their missions non-stop, to the point where he feels more like the series' antagonist and Skipper's arch-rival than comic relief and a friend of the penguins, and acts like he has control over all the animals in the zoo. Actually, he acts like he has control over everyone's lives, both in and outside the zoo.\n\nMost of the zoo is constantly annoyed by Julien's behavior, especially Maurice and the Penguins.\n\nHe has even twerked a couple of times as well.\n\nHis design is very unappealing when compared to his design in the movies and All Hail King Julien!, and the lower-quality CGI animation used for the show The Penguins of Madagascar doesn't help either.\n\nHe is much meaner to Mort than he usually is, although, given Mort's creepy obsession with Julien's feet to the point he is kind of a stalker, that's kind of understandable.\n\nHe often blames Maurice for the problems Julien caused, though sometimes he does it in All Hail King Julien but to a lesser extent compared to The Penguins of Madagascar.\n\nIn \"All King, No Kingdom\", Julien once got angry at Maurice and Mort because they broke his throne and banished them from his kingdom! Jeez, why be so quick with judgments?! It was an accident for crying out loud!! In fact, that's an invalid reason to banish someone. No wonder Maurice decided he and Mort ditch Julien and throw a party with Julien not invited.\n\nLuckily he got what he deserved when he received separation anxiety from that cause and realized what he did was wrong since he started to miss Maurice and Mort.\n\nAnother infamous example was in “Crown Fools”, when he accused Skipper of stealing his crown when Skipper actually didn’t, it bounced off the bouncy castle and into the vent. Yeah, why would you accuse someone who didn’t take your crown, Julien?\n\nHis third infamous tantrum was in “Assault & Batteries”, when he got angry at Skipper for stealing the batteries to his stereo, although he kept the zoo annoyed by trying to play it all night long.\n\nHe has another minor tantrum in \"Tangled in the Web\". During the scene where he, the Penguins, and Marlene are watching the video of Alice singing, dancing, and slapping her butt, He complains that he cannot believe the people her most popular.\n\nHe is basically a male version of Brittany from Alvin and the Chipmunks, except he is way stupider and much more selfish and mean-spirited than her.\n\nHe was flanderized again in the All Hail King Julien episode \"Diapers Are the New Black\", where he turned diapers into a hot fashion trend and caused an all-out fashion war.\n\nKing Julien and the other characters wearing diapers is nonsensical, humiliating, laughable and irrational. Diapers are only for babies and elderly people who can't control their bowels; it would also be rather uncomfortable for the characters to wear diapers, as doing so could hurt them due to chafing.\n\nRedeeming Qualities\n\nHe was a much more likable and funnier character in the movies and has reverted back to his originally beloved personality in All Hail King Julien.\n\nThis thankfully didn’t affect his appearances outside The Penguins of Madagascar TV show, as he remained likable in the Madagascar sequel movies Escape 2 Africa, Europe's Most Wanted and Penguins of Madagascar and the video games.\n\nDanny Jacobs does a wonderful job voicing him, sounding nearly identical to Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nHe is still a hilarious character.\n\nThere were at least sometimes where he gets his comeuppance. Examples include “Penguiner Takes All” (He lost the last round of capture the flag and lost all his stuff, including his crown and Mort, to the penguins as karma for taking their stuff during his winning streak.), and “Crown Fools” (He got chased away by Marlene with a crowbar from Rico for having a spare crown all along because the crown he lost got a little filthy.)\n\nHe can be likable and have his original personality in a few episodes, as he does help the penguins in their serious missions sometimes.\n\nHis love-hate relationship with Skipper is hilarious, and their chemistry together is both awesome and believable.\n\nVideos\n\nRecent changes\n\nNewyork30 • 59 minutes ago\n\nNewyork30 • 1 hour ago\n\nScarface • 3 hours ago\n\nScarface • 3 hours ago"
