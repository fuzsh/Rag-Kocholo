After years of toiling away on TV, the penguins from the Madagascar series of movies finally have their own theatrical feature coming in November, titled The Penguins of Madagascar.

DreamWorks Animation has released the first trailer for The Penguins of Madagascar, directed by Simon Smith and Eric Darnell. The new trailer shows off the penguins' special set of skills, including MacGyvering themselves in and out of all sorts of weird situations and eating cheesy snacks, all to the tune of Kenny Loggins's "Danger Zone."

Discover the secrets of the most entertaining and mysterious birds in the global espionage game: Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private now must join forces with the chic spy organization, the North Wind, led by Agent Classified (we could tell you his name, but then... you know), voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch to stop the villainous Dr. Octavius Brine, voiced by John Malkovich, from taking over the world.

Also featuring the voices of Tom McGrath, Chris Miller, Chris Knights, Ken Jeong, Annett Mahendru and Peter Stormare, Penguins of Madagascar opens November 26, 2014.
