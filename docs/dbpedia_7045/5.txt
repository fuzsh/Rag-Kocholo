About

Penguins Of Madagascar is the name of a group of penguins from the 2005 animated movie Madagascar, as well as the name of a TV show and movie about the penguins, titled Penguins Of Madagascar. In a parody of The A-Team, each of the penguins has a code name and specialty, starting with Skipper, the leader, Kowalski, the brains, Private, the face, and Rico, the demolitions expert. Since their debut, the penguins have been heavily featured in memes, notably Well Boys, We Did It. Racism Is No More and Kowalski's various memes.

Origin

The penguins were first featured in the movie Madagascar, which released on May 27th, 2005. They also appeared in the subsequent films Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, released November 7th, 2008, and Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, released on June 8th, 2012. Throughout the film series, the penguins have had several of their scenes and phrases turned into memes. This meme force hit its stride when they were given their own TV series called Penguins of Madagascar, which began airing on November 28th, 2008. A trailer for the TV show was posted to YouTube on January 19th, 2018, by Showtapes Reviews, receiving 28,000 views in three years (shown below).

Spread

Following the success of the TV show, a movie was optioned that would serve as a spin-off for the Madagascar series. The movie was also titled Penguins of Madagascar, and it was released on November 26th, 2014, to great success both financially and memeticly. A trailer for the movie was posted on the Peacock Kids YouTube channel on June 12, 2014, where it received 1.7 million views in seven years (shown below).

After the release of the movie, Penguin's content dried up, meaning that all future memes had to be made using older material, requiring a rewatch of the series. This wasn't easily done when the show was on cable TV, but after moving to Netflix, it became much easier to get high-quality screenshots and videos to make memes with, helping them to spread into new formats.
