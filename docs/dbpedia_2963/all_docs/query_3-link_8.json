        "text": "Ever buy a firearm because you saw it in a movie? Let’s hear about it.\n\nMine was the Beretta 92F, made famous in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard movies. It was also awarded a US military contract.\n\nIt shot like a dream, but it never felt great in my hand.\n\nFunny thing is, if you rewatch the Lethal Weapon movies, they were full of anti-gun propaganda. Sometimes it was overt (“armor piercing cop-killer bullets”) and sometimes it was subtle, like a gun control poster behind the characters as they had a discussion.\n\nI guess I didn’t swallow the obtuse Hollywood propaganda, because it was the first handgun I bought the day I turned 21. Yippee-ki-yay… you know the rest.\n\nMy father-in-law has a Beretta M92, which had a rough double action trigger, but the single action was like cheating. I purchased a Langdon Tactical 92G, which is DA/SA, decocker only. The double action trigger has been smoothed out, and the pull is under 10lbs. It’s one of my favorite pistols of all time.\n\nFun fact. The Beretta in Die hard is the same gun from Lethal Weapon. Supposedly they went to the prop department and said they needed a cop’s gun, and Lethal Weapon was a recent cop movie.\n\nOne thing that also affects which guns are used in movies and TV shows it’s ability to reliable fire and cycle blanks. The Bren Ten used by Sonny Crockett in the first season of Miami vice was actually converted to fire .45 ACP, because there was a problem with 10mm blanks. I can’t recall if they didn’t cycle the action reliably or if they were just too much hassle to source.\n\nSo there are two custom Bren Tens in .45 ACP out there, one belongs to Michael Mann.\n\nEdited to add pics:"
