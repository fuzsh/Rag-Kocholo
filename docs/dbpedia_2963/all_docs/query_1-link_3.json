        "text": "June 20, 2022\n\nA story about a duel who went a bit different than normal. A story about honor, pride and pistols. It was too short to make an opinion of the author. I will also read the Queen of Spades next for more.\n\nThis story was interesting because the author fought in many duels and eventually died because of one.\n\nDecember 13, 2015\n\n،سوگند خوردم تا به سویش آتش کنم\n\nهمان گونه که قانون مبارزه ی تن به تن\n\nاجازه می دهد(نوبت من بود تا\n\n(تیراندازی کنم\n\n«غروب در اردوگاه»\n\nداستان کوتاه و زیبایی در مورد دوئل\n\nواقعا حیرت اور است که دوئل چه جایگاه والایی در جوامع اروپایی داشته است. گاهی مبنای حق یا ناحق بودن طرفین بوده\n\n!!و گاهی نشان دهنده شرافتمندی یک مرد\n\nو تاسف برانگیز این است که الکساندر پوشکین هم در یک دوئل کشته شد. می گویند همسر زیبایش با افسری فرانسوی رابطه ای نامشروع داشته و پوشکین\n\n..برای حفظ غرورش این افسر را به دوئل فرا می خواند و\n\nدوئل درمیان اشراف زادگان و مخصوصا نظامیان بیانگر شرافت بود\n\nمعمولا در بین نظامی ها، اگر کسی که مورد توهین قرار می گرفت، طرف مقابل را به دوئل دعوت نمی کرد ترسو خوانده می شد و طرد می شد\n\nنیازمند شهامت بودن، آخرین چیزی است که افسران جوان می توانند آن را ببخشند. افسران معمولا به شهامت به مثابه بالاترین فضیلت انسانی و عذر هر اشتباه می نگرند\n\n:قسمت هایی که شاید لو دهند داستان باشند\n\nداستان در باره مردی است که در دوئل گلوله اش را شلیک نمی کند چون می\n\n..بیند حریفش که گلوله اش را شلیک کرده بدون ترس منتظر شلیک اوست\n\nسیلویو را دیگر هرگز ندیدم. می گویند که فرماندهی یک دسته از «هتاریست ها» را در انقلاب «الکساندر یپسلانتی» به عهده داشت و در جنگ «اسکولیانی» کشته شد\n\n........\n\nهتاریست ها : به انقلابیون یونانی گفته می شود که از سال 1810 به بعد برای استقلال یونان از سلطه عثمانی می جنگیدند و به زبان یونانی ، آنها را اتایرا می نامند\n\nالکساندر یپسلانتی، متولد سال 1792، یک یونانی انقلابی بود که فرماندهی گروه مخفی یونانیان موسوم به «فیلیکی اتایرا» را در 1820 به عهده گرفت.وی در سال 1821 به «مولداوی» حمله کرد. در سال 1821 پس از شکست از قوای عثمانی در جنگ «دراگاشان»، به اتریش فرار کرد و در 1828 در آنجا درگذشت.برادرش «دیمتریوس» نیز دنبال مبارزات وی را گرفت\n\nDecember 2, 2020\n\n\"The Shot\" is part of a short story collection by Alexander Pushkin. This collection is titled \"The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin\". Again, LOL, I was listening to Old Time Radio show (The Weird Circle), that originally aired March 18, 1945 and on the station that I listen to usually plays on the date first broadcasted, that was on March 18, 2018 that I heard this story again and it was time to read my first taste of Pushkin.\n\nI thought the radio version was very entertaining but something was missing of the author's profound message he had conveyed. Sometimes the stories are spot on from the book and this time it was close in many aspects but so different in ending and message was there but yet not so striking. I suppose the producers had to spice up the story to make it more interesting which they succeeded because I was interested but the ending rang kind of false. The story is interesting from the beginning but does not have all the bravado as the radio version. Do I have your interest if you have read or want to read this but yet want to hear the radio version? It is worth the listen IMO.\n\nI loved the story because of how Pushkin brought out Silvio as an enigma but we gradually understand all. Brief Silvio has something happen to him that he carries in his breast for years and finally his chance comes. What that is I dare not tell for why would I ruin the suspense for you! I read a Delphi collection of his works where my highlights and notes are located and it is listed under my Pushkin shelf. Will I read him again, yes for sure, I am looking forward at some point in the future.\n\nThe radio version\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3cZNwSF...\n\nsuspense December 2, 1954\n\nhttps://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com...\n\nJanuary 2, 2020\n\nThe last card game in “The Queen of Spades” is described as being as tense and dramatic as a duel, but this story gives us the real thing: a classic Russian duel between two proud and puffed-up men drunk on pompous conceptions of their honor and bravery. It’s about revenge and, interestingly, restraint. The latter jumps out at me because in two other Pushkin stories I just read, namely, “The Queen of Spades” and “The Fisherman and the Goldfish,” a character is portrayed as greedy and insatiable, which leads to their downfall. Even after they have amassed uncountable riches, they lust for more, until they lose everything, apparently scolded for their avarice and lack of restraint. Here, the character denies himself his most anticipated pleasure just when the opportunity finally presents itself after years of waiting, declaring himself satisfied and walking off into the night.\n\nNo moral here, but maybe a life hack. When facing down death, you could get on your knees like most would and beg for your life. Or, you could start eating cherries and spitting out their pits towards people, just as untroubled as you please. A sort of whistling past the graveyard. If there’s any truth to this story, your would-be killer (or even Death himself) will be so enraged by your indifference that they’ll lose interest in depriving you of your life, when you clearly attach so little value to it. Say the old oath, The devil may care but I do not, and, eventually, the devil will throw up his hands and walk away. And you can get back to enjoying your cherries.\n\nTitle in Spanish: El disparo, El duelo: The Duel, Un disparo memorable: A Memorable Shot\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\nDuelling and honour are the main themes in this short story by Pushkin. Made more interesting when you know Pushkin fought many duels over his life before dying after one.\n\nMay 23, 2020\n\nInteresting story about the emptiness of revenge. A very Russian tale.\n\nDecember 13, 2019\n\nEste cuento de Pushkin es un típico ejemplo de narración en la que el autor mezcla elementos reales en la ficción, especialmente los autobiográficos.\n\nEl cuento trata acerca del honor a partir de un duelo, tema tan afín a él. Sucede lo mismo en su afamado Eugenio Oneguin y también en su propia vida.\n\nFue a partir de un duelo que falleció el poeta. Y también fue una cuestión de honor.\n\nDecember 30, 2018\n\nEl disparo es uno de los cinco relatos que engloban los Cuentos del difunto Iván Petróvich Belkin, trata sobre un duelo pendiente escrito unos años antes de que el propio poeta muriera tras dos días de dolorosa agonía a consecuencia de un disparo mortal recibido en un duelo.\n\nAugust 6, 2014\n\nI have always adored Russian literature, but, for some reason, I have never read anything by Pushkin (1799-1837). Obviously, his best known work is Eugine Onegin, but I could not resist trying this short story on kindle (especially as it is currently available free). The story has been given a modern translation, designed so the reader can understand references without checking footnotes. I suspect this will understandably divide opinions, but it does make the story accessible to those who might want to try Pushkin’s work, but not know where to begin.\n\nOur narrator is an army officer, stationed at a remote village. There is little to do there and so, although there is an older man who is sarcastic and ill tempered, the officers all attend his open table. The man, named Silvio by our narrator, is obviously a very impressive fellow and so there is much astonishment when, after an argument at cards, he does not demand the satisfaction of a duel. This obviously harms his reputation, but Silvio explains his reasons and there is, of course, a twist to the tale. A very enjoyable story and beautifully written.\n\nNovember 13, 2020\n\n3*\n\nMy first Pushkin, but too short to know whether I'd like to read more. It's a fun enough story about playing with and disregarding the highly formalised codes of honour duels, but it takes on a whole new meaning when you remember that Pushkin himself died in a duel.\n\nMarch 16, 2014\n\nThe Shot by Alexander Pushkin\n\nThe Russians are very complex, sometimes warm hearted, other times cruel, extraordinarily brave- I think of War and Peace now, weak- some characters in The Idiot and other Russian masterpieces…they can be majestic like Tolstoy, Turgenev and petty and dictatorial like Stalin and Putin.\n\nThere is love and hate in my heart: I love many Russian books, achievements and even dogs- I own five Russian noble hounds. But I watch the news and I see how they want to grab the Crimea, then Eastern Ukraine, after they had beaten Georgia and occupied a third of it.\n\nThe Soviets and communism are the main reason a few generations of Eastern Europeans, including the one writing here, have lost opportunities, years of their lives and loved ones.\n\nComing back to “The Shot”, the mysterious Russian soul is shown here. The portrayal of an officer is at the heart of many a Russian story and so it is here.\n\nThe main character, Silvio is an excellent shot, but when the occasion comes up, he avoids fighting a duel. This is because he holds a grudge and wants to pay back that debt. I will not go into details which might spoil the pleasure for an eventual reader of this review.\n\nThere is drinking – “champagne flows like water”\n\nThe atmosphere of this story recalls some of the Russian films, “Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano „in particular, even if it would be more accurate to say it is the other way around, the film being an adaptation of one of the classic stories.\n\nWhat strikes me often is the fact that Russian characters at least, I do not know about the real ones, can be romantic, loving and kind and then turn into furious bullies, criminals. If we refer to history, they killed, their soviet leaders- millions of their own people by violence, starvation, execution and often torture. I guess this is the human nature, but here the extremes puzzle me.\n\nDecember 25, 2022\n\nyes im reading short stories to reach my reading goal no one look at me\n\nApril 9, 2019\n\nRead online. For anyone interested the link is below.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nThe Shot is a short story by Alexander Pushkin published in 1831. It is included in The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, a series of five short stories. The Shot takes place in Russia and details events at a military station in a provincial country outpost, and then several years later, on a country estate. Pushkin discusses themes of honor, revenge and death, and places them within the broader context of Russian society. This tale tells the story of a soldier named Silvio who harbors a grudge for many years following an argument in which he was embarrassed and disrespected in front of his peers. Told from the perspective of an unnamed narrator, the story concludes with Silvio returning to seek his revenge against the count when he hears of his marriage and figures the count will value his life more now that he has something to lose.\n\nMarch 6, 2014\n\nRead here:http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/worl... under the file entitled 'Stories by Foreign Authors: Russian'\n\nand The Shot starts on page 22.\n\nFrom \"Poushkin's Prose Tales.\" Translated by T. Keane.\n\nOpening: We were stationed in the little town of N--. The life of an officer in the army is well known. In the morning, drill and the riding-school; dinner with the Colonel or at a Jewish restaurant; in the evening, punch and cards. In N--- there was not one open house, not a single marriageable girl. We used to meet in each other's rooms, where, except our uniforms, we never saw anything.\n\nIt seems that I had encountered this short story before as reading through brought back memories of being totally flummoxed by what passed for honour and heroes back then.\n\n“The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.” ― L.P. Hartley, The Go-Between\n\nNovember 3, 2019\n\nTo fall asleep, I picked this at random from a beside shelf. A short story, nearly two centuries old, it is like a thriller. Mystery, suspense, intensity.\n\nSet in provincial Russia, and focused on provincial but especially military life, a rivalry drives the action.\n\nThe translation I read, by T. Keane, seemed great. You should take my opinion about the translation lightly, though. I know next to nothing about Russian or Pushkin.\n\nI would recommend the story – a twenty or thirty minute read. If you want to sleep, it is a bad choice.\n\nMay 19, 2023\n\n\"The Shot\" is a captivating short story written by Alexander Pushkin, one of the most celebrated figures in Russian literature.

Cerita ini diawali oleh seorang opsir tentara yang mempunyai kawan dekat bernama Silvio (tentu hanya nama akrab, sangat tidak Rusia sekali namanya! Haha).\n\nPushkin dalam prosanya tidak menyertai nama kota pada latar kejadiannya. Pada buku yang saya baca, ia memberi nama \"Kota T\". Pada buku yang lain, alih bahasanya menjadi \"Kota ***.\"\n\nNovela ini bercerita tentang pertarungan ala Rusia, kehormatan, dan balas dendam!\n\nOctober 26, 2021\n\n2.5 stars\n\nThe context of story is about honor, revenge and death of Russian society.\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\n\nNada especial. No es malo, pero no te genera nada.\n\nAdemás está en un compilado de terror y no tiene nada de suspenso o alguna característica del género (pero eso es más problema de la editorial).\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nStarted off really interesting, but in the last third I got quite let down and bored, it was underwhelming\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nAlexander Pushkin (1799-1837) is said to be the founder of Russian literature, but it is also said that unless you can read his poetry in Russian, you will never really understand how great he is, nor why Russians revere him so.\n\nWell, my Russian is confined to being able to count to ten or order a coffee, so I’m a long way from being able to read the great man’s poetry. But I have read his short story, The Shot (1831), so that I can at least claim to have read a little of their romantic literary hero.\n\nThe story has a certain frisson because it’s about a duel and Pushkin died aged only 37 as the result of a duel – with the otherwise forgettable Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d’Anthès who had tried to seduce Pushkin’s flirtatious wife Natalya. According to Wikipedia, Pushkin was a hot-tempered fellow, fighting 29 duels altogether to defend his honour. He was not the only young man to die prematurely in this type of stupid testosterone display, but his death was certainly Russia’s most tragic literary loss.\n\nLike all members of the nobility at that time, Pushkin was required to do military service, so he was familiar with the lifestyle of a young officer (later deplored for its pernicious effects by Tolstoy in Resurrection). The Shot’s narrator is a young man whose regiment is deployed to a dull country town where the young officers do riding-drills in the morning and while away the evening with drinking and playing cards. Only one of the card players, called Silvio by the narrator though that is not his name, is a civilian, and he is a former Hussar whose reasons for early retirement are not known. He is caustic and taciturn and not very well off, though he can afford plenty of champagne. He keeps up his skill with the pistol by shooting holes in the walls of his room.\n\nTo read the rest of my review please visit http://anzlitlovers.com/2012/08/15/th...\n\nNovember 27, 2017\n\nPushkin fought numerous duels and died in one of these affairs so he wrote this story from experience. It is interesting. When one man shows up for a duel seeming not to care if he lives or dies, (he eats cherries while his opponent takes aim at him), the opponent (Silvio) decides to reserve his shot for another time because his need for vengeance will not be satisfied. Silvio reasons, \"What's the use of depriving him of his life... if he himself doesn't cherish it?\" He waits for years, practices every day and avoids dueling to save himself for a showdown. Finally, Silvio learns that his nemesis is married and now since he has something to live for, the time has arrived to take his life. They meet for a second duel and here again, Silvio decides not to shoot him, instead taking his revenge by having the man's conscious to be in his debt and being certain that his wife knows of his actions.\n\nI wonder if Poe was familiar with Pushkin. \"The Shot\" was published right before Poe turned to short stories and I can see how Poe might have been inspired by Pushkin's style.\n\nJune 6, 2017\n\nIt's an interesting short story about honor and revenge and how pointless it all can be when taken into account over time.\n\nDecember 21, 2019\n\nakın altan'ın sesinden, kendi youtube kanalında dinledim."
