        "text": "If you have been on social media during Paris 2024, you will have seen a lot of people talking about Kim Yeji, the ‘coolest’ Olympic athlete at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Republic of Korea shooter won silver in the 10m air pistol women’s event, where she was only beaten by compatriot and Olympic Village roommate Oh Ye Jin, who set an Olympic Record of 243.2.\n\nFans have been captured by Kim on social media, and she has gone viral around the world during the Games.\n\nNonetheless, it is not just her sharpshooting skills that have made Kim a new fan favourite.\n\nShooting at Paris 2024 Olympics preview\n\nKim Yeji, the ‘coolest’ sharpshooter at Paris 2024\n\nIf there is one thing that stands out about Kim, it is her epic look with the bespoke glasses she wears to help with precision.\n\nThey look like something straight out of a sci-fi film, and are popular among shooting athletes as they help to avoid blur and increase visual focus. They include a lens, blinders and a mechanical iris.\n\nNot only does Kim wear these glasses, but her stylish demeanour and body language make for a unique look.\n\nSpecifically, a viral video from May shows Kim’s composure and eye-catching appearance, all black as she calmly broke the world record in the 25m pistol women’s event. She showed the same quality and class at Paris 2024 to win her first medal at her first Games in the French capital.\n\nKim’s lucky charm for Olympic success\n\nNo one can dispute Kim’s swag while competing, but what makes her even more popular is her authenticity, specifically with the help of a little friend.\n\nKim has been wearing a stuffed elephant toy on her waist while competing, one which belongs to her young daughter. The photos are marvellous, the shooter in full focus and looking like she means business – with a stuffed animal by her side.\n\nIt is a lovely touch and one which has enamoured fans, and certainly her daughter too. Perhaps it was a good luck charm to be carrying a grey animal, leading her to the silver medal at Chateauroux.\n\nKim will next compete in the 25m pistol women’s qualification on 2 August."
