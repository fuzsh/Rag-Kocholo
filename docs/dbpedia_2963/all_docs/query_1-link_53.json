        "text": "This essay investigates interconnections between the novelist, Henry James, Ivan Turgenev, and Aleksandr Pushkin and identifies the racial subtext of these associations. Several scholars have connected Pushkin and James. But none of this scholarship has speculated on whether it was the poet's African heritage that was at the root of hidden connections between these authors. Moreover, though most scholarship on Pushkin's reception in the United States focuses on twentieth-century African American literature, his African heritage was publicized much earlier. In fact, nineteenth-century commentators on both sides of the Atlantic frequently discussed Pushkin's racial heritage as a canonical European writer of African descent. This essay recovers how Henry James used Pushkin's daughter, the morganatic Countess Merenberg, as a model for the racially ambiguous “morganatic” Baroness Münster in The Europeans (1878). A decade later, James seems to have invoked the Countess Merenberg once more in his rewriting of Pushkin's “The Queen of Spades” (1833) in The Aspern Papers (1888). While James publicly attributed Byron and Shelley as inspirations, the discourse surrounding the African heritage of Pushkin and his heirs helps explain why the novelist minimized and erased the racial lineage at the center of The Europeans and The Aspern Papers.\n\n20. Vigel exacerbates his racist framing in the remainder of this sketch: “Pushkin had been visiting the Turgenev brothers more and more frequently…Someone from this group…proposed that Pushkin write some verses….From his mother [Pushkin] was descended from the Moor general Gannibal, and in the flexibility of his limbs and the speed of his movements he rather resembled Negroes and the human-like inhabitants of Africa. With this agility he suddenly jumped up on the large, long table standing before the window, stretched out on it, grabbed a pen and paper and, with a laugh, began to write.” F.F. Vigel΄, “Iz zapisok,” in V.E. Vatsuro, M.I. Gillel΄son, R.V. Iezuitova, Ia.L. Levkovich, eds., A.S. Pushkin v vospominaniiakh sovremennikov v dvukh tomkah. Tom pervyi (Moscow, 1985), 222–23.\n\n30. A sample of two reports in the U.S. covering the controversy surrounding Countess Sophie Nikolaievna of Merenberg and Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich’s marriage. The account at right was published on the front page of The Norfolk Virginian on October 24, 1891. That same day, the headline on the left was published by Richmond, Indiana’s The Richmond Item. There are no copyright restrictions on these articles.\n\n33. Marcus C. Levitt, Russian Literary Politics and the Pushkin Celebration of 1880 (Ithaca, 1989), especially 137: “Ill-disposed contemporaries noted with some disgust the writer’s references in his speech to the ‘Aryan race,’ and Mikhailovsky sarcastically queried why Dostoevsky did not take his message of salvation to the heathen Hottentots rather than to civilized Europeans.” For additional political context surrounding this speech, see Susanne Fusso, Editing Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy: Mikhail Katkov and the Great Russian Novel (DeKalb, IL, 2017), 204–45.\n\n35.
