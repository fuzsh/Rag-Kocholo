        "text": "Armed adults frequently mishandle their guns in schools. Keeping kids safe means keeping guns off K-12 campuses.\n\nOur comprehensive analysis finds there have been nearly 100 publicly reported incidents of mishandled guns at schools in the last five years, including:\n\nA teacher’s loaded gun falling from his waistband during a cartwheel.\n\nA student grabbing an officer’s gun while the officer attempted to subdue the student.\n\nA teacher unintentionally firing a gun in class during a safety demonstration.\n\nFor years, the gun lobby has pushed policies to arm teachers and allow other adults to carry guns on K-12 campuses. Arming teachers is an incredibly unpopular proposition, opposed by seven out of ten teenagers, eight out of ten teachers, and seven out of ten parents. And for good reason.\n\nA study published in March 2019 found “no evidence that the presence of resource officers in schools lessened the severity of school shooting incidents.” And there is no evidence that armed teachers would be any more effective. In fact, a robust body of public health research strongly suggests armed teachers would not effectively deter violence. On the contrary, they would likely increase, rather than decrease, students’ exposure to gun violence in schools.\n\nTo catalog the risk guns in schools pose to student safety, we conducted a systematic review of publicly-reported incidents involving mishandled guns on school campuses. We analyzed data from the Gun Violence Archive since 2014 (when their records begin) and independently verified each incident.\n\nScroll through the comprehensive list, broken down into a few general categories, to see how guns brought onto campus—sometimes for the purpose of preventing violence—can actually increase risk.\n\nGuns Left Accessible to Children\n\nCatherine Cook School | Chicago, Illinois\n\nMarch 6, 2020—An off-duty police officer serving as a school security guard left a gun in a school bathroom where it was discovered by three young students.
