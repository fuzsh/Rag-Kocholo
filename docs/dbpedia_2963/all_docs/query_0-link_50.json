        "text": "It’s still thrilling to see Fred run for his life through the teeming streets of holiday-makers at the beginning of Brighton Rock, pursued by Pinkie’s gang. Thrilling because it feels like documentary, all hand-held verite energy. Look closely at the crowds observing his mad dash to the railway station and his futile escape to the pier, where he meets his end on the ghost train. They’re not extras, but passers-by.\n\nBut there’s a moment when that realism elides into artifice. Just before Pinkie throws Fred into the briny, the film travels 95 miles in a split second, from Brighton to Welwyn Garden City, cutting from the outside of the amusement arcade to the inside. Of course, greater distances have been covered from exterior shot to interior in the history of cinema, but Brighton Rock is so rooted in its location that it feels like a cheat. From the title itself, to the history lesson about Brighton’s gangs before the war, to the footage of tourists gallivanting on the beach and on the pier, it all seems like Brighton through and through. But cut it open and you’ll find one word: Welwyn. What’s surprising is how many of the resort’s landmarks were recreated in land-locked Hertfordshire – the pier’s Palace of Pleasure, the photo kiosk, the pub, the lodging, almost every interior except for the dance hall and hotel, which were built in the bigger facilities in Elstree.\n\nWhat’s also remarkable is just how many sets were squeezed into Welwyn, because its one defining feature was its size. It was tiny. A reporter from Cinema magazine visited the set of Brighton Rock and observed that “every member of the unit could give points to a trained contortionist after 10 days shooting.” There were even bigger problems on The Queen Of Spades where a key prop, a life-sized coach, could only move ten feet until it went through a wall.\n\nSurprisingly, Welwyn was purpose built, described at the time as “the finest and most up-to-date facilities for picture-making in the world”, boasting the largest roof-span of any in Europe. The owners were particularly proud of a large wall that opened to the elements, and their huge backlot. However, the actual studio floor space was only 16,000 square feet; by comparison, Denham covered 120,000 square feet.\n\nThe studios were built in 1928 by British Instructional Films, who started in an army hut in Elstree before moving to Surbiton and then Cricklewood. The company made the move to Welwyn because they wanted to be part of the garden city movement, but also because it was 400 feet above sea level and therefore relatively free of fog.\n\nThe brainchild of Harry Bruce Woolfe, BIF specialised in two genres – battle recreations and nature documentaries, and for a while in the mid 20s, they were the most commercially successful studio in Britain. Paul Rotha called them “the sheet anchor of the British film industry”. The reason that their films consistently made money is that they were cheap. The Battles Of Coronel And The Falkland Islands mixed historical recreation with animated diagrams and maps, for example, and cost £18,000 to make and recouped £70,000 at the UK box-office. Peas And Cues told the life story of a sweet pea in just nine minutes, with the aid of time lapse photography.\n\nPhenomenally successful, The Secrets Of Nature series had relatively few over-heads. The star of The Bedtime Stories Of Archie The Ant wouldn’t have demanded a large fee, for instance, or a bigger trailer. But then in 1926, BIF decided to break into feature films with a bio-pic of Napoleon, and the stakes got higher, the margins for failure slimmer.\n\nIn the first few years, all was going well. Celestial City was Welwyn’s first feature, A Cottage On Dartmoor its first masterpiece. This thriller about an inmate’s escape from Dartmoor prison was as fine a homage to German Expressionism as anything Hitchcock ever produced. And if you had visited the set, you would have seen its director sitting under the camera, dressed in workman’s overalls. His name was Anthony Asquith, known as Puffin because of his resemblance to the sea-bird, and he was the son of a former prime minister. A closeted homosexual and a full-time alcoholic, Asquith had the kind of access-all-areas lifestyle you might imagine someone of his pedigree might enjoy. He spent a year in Hollywood as a guest of the Pickford Fairbanks enclave, where he became close friends with Chaplin. At BIF, he had a predictably meteoric rise through the ranks, from dogsbody, to prop master, to assistant make-up artist; within a year he was at the helm of Shooting Stars. This naval-gazing comedy about a silent film production and the subsequent tube-set romance Underground revealed a genuine talent and it’s easy to understand, or at least forgive, Dilys Powell’s bit of puffery when she claimed “it’s impossible to think of the history of British cinema without thinking of Anthony Asquith.”\n\nWhereas Shooting Stars and Underground were both silent films, A Cottage On Dartmoor marked the transition into the new era: sound was added in post-production in Germany in 1929. Though, of course, they had no way of knowing it, the invention of sound cinema would herald the quick demise of BIF and the end of Asquith’s experimental phase. Over the next thirty years, entropy set into his film-making style, degenerating into polite stage adaptations\n\nIn retrospect, 1928 was possibly the worst year to open a studio, when few foresaw the revolutionary, Year Zero impact that the introduction of sound would have. Only 12 months after it was opened, the entire studio in Welwyn would have to be re-fitted, not only for recording sound but, more importantly, for keeping sounds out. The fact that it was next to a busy railway line now became a problem rather than an advantage (yes, actors and technicians could get to it easily but now they would have to wait for the train to pass before recording dialogue). And Welwyn was not the only studio that to embrace this new technology at a curmudgeonly pace. According to Simon McCallum’s dissertation on Welwyn, only two sound productions were made in the UK in 1929. This delay would have major financial repercussions for a tiny studio like Welwyn.\n\nOnly a year after its refurbishment, BIF was taken over by BIP. BIP, as readers of the Elstree chapter will remember, stood for British International Pictures. They were also known as The Porridge Factory, because they were run by a Scotsman who positively embraced his national stereotype. John Maxwell pinched every penny and employed an evil henchman to do his bidding – Walter C. Mycroft, a five foot, neo-Fascist hunchback, dubbed by those who worked under him as The Czar Of All The Rushes.\n\nEmployees at Welwyn Studios were in for a bit of a culture shock. BIF were regarded as the brains trust of the British film industry. For some, they were arrogant with it. Hugh Castle in film magazine Close-Up derided their “non-creative intellectual snobbery.” That was about to end and swiftly. Maxwell who “didn’t like films for the intelligentsia” acquired Welwyn “solely with the idea of making box-office product”. Though, apparently he didn’t say that to Woolfe when he bought his studio.\n\nAsquith, a bona fide member of the intelligentsia, lasted only a couple more years under the new regime. Whether it was the severe limitations of the new sound technology or the new commercial limitations placed upon him, Asquith’s final two films at Welwyn showed only a flicker of the promise of his silent pictures. Tell England, a first World War film boasted great battle sequences, as you might expect from the director of A Cottage On Dartmoor, but was undermined by stilted dialogue and grating accents described as “artificial and precious” by Picturegoer. Dance, Pretty Lady didn’t persuade critics or the paying public, and its director left to join Gaumont. Bruce Woolfe lasted a few years, directing a feature with BIF board member, fellow patriot and novelist John Buchan. England Awake did the cinematic equivalent of the 21 gun salute to the nation’s advances in science and industry, complete with a commentary by the “Duke Of Wellington”. Woolfe eventually had enough of Maxwell and left in 1933.\n\nThe relationship with BIP (and then ABPC) was one way – Welwyn was an outpost, a colony of Elstree. It was essentially there to make quota quickies – films that only existed to meet government targets (and we all know that works well and is never subject to abuse). Even if some good movies were made, it was more by luck than judgement, or at least the judgement of Walter C Mycroft. And though it was a good learning ground for young film-makers, this was never going to be a model for innovation. Two years after Universal had decided that horror movies were now outdated and unprofitable, ABPC thought this was the moment to make one of their own. Dark Eyes Of London even starred Universal alumni and Dracula star, Bela Lugosi, an actor who would spend the rest of his career essentially resurrecting his one famous role. The film was also known as The Human Monster.\n\nWelwyn finally benefited from this uneasy relationship during World War II, when Elstree was conscripted by the Ministry Of Defence. Welwyn could continue to make feature films, being sufficiently far from London or any other major target. To quote Patricia Warren in British Film Studios: “so, with gas masks, ration books, blackout curtains and the Home Guard at the ready, Welwyn struggled through the war years.” Much of its output was, of course, propaganda, such as Mein Kampf, My Crimes, in which Hitler’s rise to power was told through newsreel and reconstructions starring a young Peter Ustinov and Herbert Lom. Hitchcock was stationed at Welwyn to make two films designed to aid the war effort. They turned out to be two of the most perverse examples of propaganda that you could possibly imagine, the first now seeming like a dry run for Vertigo. Bon Voyage begins with a French resistance fighter’s story of his daring escape from a Nazi prison. It’s filmed with all the bravado you’d expect from the man who shot The 39 Steps. Then, Hitchcock pulls the rug firmly from underneath the audience and our hero. We see another flashback from another perspective, in which he’s the unwitting stooge of Nazi officers, who have staged the escape so that he could lead them to other Resistance fighters. An essay on the subjective nature of apparently objective truths is probably not what the Ministry Of Information had in mind when they hired Hitchcock. But maybe they should have known better than to employ him again. Apparently irritated by all the interference he received from the French Resistance during the making of Bon Voyage, he exacted revenge with Aventure Malgache, which depicted the Resistance riddled with spies and informants, and rejoiced in British stereotypes of the French and was shelved until 1993.\n\nIt wasn’t all curios. Some of the most famous and celebrated films from Welwyn were made in the final years of the war and its immediate aftermath. Herbert Wilcox made the first of his London Melodramas, I Live In Grosvenor Square and Piccadilly Incident, beginning a series that would break box office records still unbeaten to this day. And after the war, two masterpieces – Brighton Rock, which was going to be Asquith’s return to Welwyn, and The Queen of Spades.\n\nThe Queen Of Spades is the most quintessential Welwyn film because its aesthetic was partly determined by the size of the studio. And partly by the fact that director Thorold Dickinson had only three days of prep, quickly drafted in when writer Rodney Ackland fell out with producer Anatole de Grunwald. As the director would later tell Film Dope magazine: “I took over. If I hadn’t, they’d have closed not only the film down, but the studio: 150 people out of work, it would have been shameful. But it was quite a strain because we had to alter much of the script as we went along.” Dickinson changed the structure of Ackland’s script because they couldn’t work out where the flashbacks were meant to go. Shooting wasn’t much easier, the trains could still be heard on set, and so too did the hooter on the Shredded Wheat factory. In fact, the factory gave Dickinson one of his biggest headaches “the biggest outside influence was having to come through Welwyn Garden City at 8.30 in the morning, past the Shredded Wheat factory, and try to imagine oneself in St Petersburg in 1815.”\n\nHarder also to imagine that you were in 19th century Russia when the sets were half built. In many cases, the claustrophobic atmosphere and vertiginous camera angles were both a knowing homage to film noir and a practical solution to working on a cramped set. The ballroom was shot on a wide lens to make it far more imperious than the unimpressive reality. Similarly, the visual sleight of hand that Dickinson pulls off as the Countess rides through St Petersburg is not just an example of directorial chutzpah. It was the only way he could make a stationary carriage look like it was actually moving. That goes for the shadows which engulf much of the action: less to do with the art of chiaroscuro and more to do with the fact that the sets weren’t finished on time.\n\nWhen The Queen Of Spades was released, it was quite rightly hailed as a masterpiece. Dilys Powell called it “something rare this century, a successful essay in romantic period.” But its status slipped, forgotten until it was re-released in cinemas in 2010 with an introduction by Martin Scorsese, enthusing us into submission. Looking at it now, it’s close to being a masterpiece as you can get. Its one flaw is the final scene which revolves around the turn of a card in a game of Faro. The rules of the 17th century game are so arcane that we have no real sense of the ending, of the terrible significance of the final card. The denouement of Pushkin’s short story would have made complete sense to Russian readers in 1833; less so to British audiences in 1949, or 2010. And Dickinson was aware of the flaw. It took weeks of research for the rules of the game to be finally unearthed; a preamble was added, explaining that Faro was a bit like Snap, but all the explanation in the world couldn’t really help an audience to gasp at the big reveal, when the hand is shown and Anton Walbrook loses it in the way that only Anton Walbrook really could.\n\nDickinson’s admirable rescue attempt only staved off Welwyn’s execution for one more year. 1950’s Talk Of A Million was the last film ever to be produced in the studio. On September 21st, the closure was announced in national newspapers. The next day, 148 employees were given their cards. It was a bad time for British studios. In the same 12 months, Rank closed Shepherd’s Bush and Islington. Two years later, Denham was leased to the RAF. Television took the blame, but in case of Rank it was also due to the efforts of one man, the Dr Beeching of the film industry. John Davis, was, in Matthew Sweet’s memorable phrase – “accountant, down-sizer, wife-beater, sadist, and unquestionably the most hated in the history of British cinema.”\n\nAs the Chairman of Rank, Davis destroyed careers as well as studios and favoured Norman Wisdom over Powell And Pressburger. A documentary was made about his life with the title The Man Who Ruined The British Film Industry. Several industry insiders lined up to speak ill of the dead: “the Caligula of British cinema”, “killed his patient on the operating table”, “a ruthless hate figure”, “an accountant who knew about numbers but not movies”. Davis moved seamlessly from J Arthur Rank’s toady to Chair, using the film crisis of 1949 (the movie equivalent of a trade war with the US that resulted in British product effectively being banned in America) to leverage power. Under his watch, the pictures got small. He became fixated with sequels and franchises and firing staff on a Friday. He was satirised in Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom as the film executive who sends a memo to staff requiring them to only use one take; they could use two only if there was a technical problem with the first. Rank went from making two thirds of films in the UK in the late 40s to making no films at all in 1977.\n\nBy the mid 80s, all the studios in this blog had disappeared. A new one, though, is being built in Dagenham. And as you drive to Bushey, road signs advertise Harry Potter World in Leavesden. The film industry is finally following Hollywood’s lead by merging film studio with theme park. Was Michael Balcon dreaming of Harry Potter when he made all those fruitless business trips to the States in the 1920s, hoping to entice Hollywood execs into co-production deals ? He knew, even then, that the British film industry was unsustainable without American backing, and that capitalism is essentially a numbers game. And we didn’t have the numbers. He might have enjoyed the sight of Hollywood executives now making similar flights to China for the very same reason. He might have smiled at the spectacle of American studios engineering their scripts to appeal to a foreign market rather than a domestic one, with stars that are big in China, with plots that take a sudden left turn to Beijing or follow the line of The Great Wall.\n\nBritish moguls dedicated most of their lives trying to compete with Hollywood, or to co-operate. And even the most successful careers ended in failure, often in bankruptcy, whether it was G.B. Samuelson, Alexander Korda or Herbert Wilcox. Even “Betty Box Office”‘s run only lasted a decade. However, as their mums surely said, at least they tried their best. And if there’s a point to this blog, it’s that Korda wasn’t Britain’s only film mogul, as is often suggested. It’s just that our other moguls have not been celebrated enough in print or pictures, relegated to the lower divisions of vanity publishing and the odd blog.\n\nElstree deserves its title as the British Hollywood, it’s the one example in this country of a genuine movie town. Of course, that town is Borehamwood, and not Elstree (the latter being regarded as more upmarket than its proletarian neighbour). And looking at all the names of the various studios, it would be easy to assume that there were many, many more than there actually were. Twenty four, in all, when in fact, there were only five. The names changed with each bankruptcy or corporate take-over.\n\nTake Neptune, for instance, the first studio on the block, it contained multitudes: Ideal, Blattner, Leslie Fuller, Rock, British National, National, ATV, BBC, and BBC Elstree. Like most studios west of London, the location was chosen because it was free from fog. Not that this mattered so much with Neptune. Unlike other studios in Europe which needed a glass roof to supply the light, Neptune was the first dark studio in this country – it was the studio that the weather couldn’t spoil. It boasted its own generating plant and even running water in the dressing rooms. Like many British film studios, it had prestigious beginnings. And like many British film studios, it couldn’t possibly keep up the momentum. 1914 was possibly the worst year to open a studio: the war destroyed the European market, while Hollywood began to dominate the American one. If you could say there was a winner in World War I, it was the USA. By the end of the conflict, Hollywood had a virtual monopoly on the film business. In 1920, American product counted for 90% of the films shown in British cinemas. A year later, Neptune went bankrupt. Through its various incarnations, the studio has managed to produce some classics of film and television, Gaslight, The Muppets, Michael Powell’s The Edge Of The World and Eastenders. In many ways, it is typical of the story of the British film studio; except in one regard – it’s still going.\n\nSo, what of the others ? We can trot through the story of Station Road quite speedily. It started life as Whitehall Studios, a vanity project for Chilean actor, writer, director and adventurer Adelqui Millar in 1929.\n\nLike many vanity projects, it had at least one major flaw. As the address suggests, it was built next to the railway line. This wouldn’t have mattered in the silent era, but 1929 saw the dawn of sound cinema. Eventually, crews would have to fit their filming around the railway timetable, stationing an employee on the roof to let them know when a train was approaching. Despite this handicap, the studio survived for another three decades, churning out quota quickies, where quality rarely mattered, and was ultimately bought by a Methodist called J Arthur Rank to produce religious education pictures.\n\nThe histories of two of the remaining studios can be told through the career of one director and mini-mogul, a man once dubbed the saviour of the British film industry, Herbert Wilcox.\n\nIf Wilcox is remembered at all, it’s for a series of melodramas set in and around Mayfair – The Courtneys Of Curzon Street, Spring In Park Lane and Maytime In Mayfair. They were the 40s equivalent of Downton Abbey, fuelling that curious British obsession in times of austerity with the upper classes. Spring In Park Lane, for instance, broke records for cinema attendance in 1948. Writing in 1966, Wilcox reminds readers of his autobiography that the record is still his and is unlikely ever to be smashed, because of the diminishing number of cinemas in Britain. Wilcox was not backwards in coming forwards and would surely have approved of Kino Weekly’s assessment of him as the saviour of British cinema in the late 40s. This is the same period that we now view as a golden age, which produced such bona-fide masterpieces as The Third Man and Kind Hearts And Coronets, as well as other Ealing comedies and minor key classics like Fallen Idol, It Always Rains on Sunday, Thunder Rock and Edward Dmytryk’s Obsession. But that’s not the view from the 40s, at least not from Kino Weekly, the bible of the film industry – Kind Hearts got good reviews, The Third Man was considered a superior product, but British films were not performing at the box office. Only one director (not Carol Reed, not Robert Hamer) was delivering, both in terms of quality and popularity. And that man was Herbert Wilcox.\n\nWhen it came to taking credit, Wilcox was always in the red. His autobiography Twenty Five Thousand Sunsets is littered with acknowledgements from others of his foresight, business acumen and sex appeal. He tells us not once but thrice that he was known as the Camberwell Casanova in his youth, and that an Austrian actress once asked him why he was the only director not to have an affair with his leading lady (although he would later make an exception for Anna Neagle). He tells us that he and Anna were the only people who recognised the genius of Citizen Kane while it was being edited and lavished praise on Orson Welles “when everyone in Hollywood treated him like a leper”. At the premiere, Welles formally recognised Wilcox’s foresight “I’ll say it first – you told me so.” And if it wasn’t for Wilcox, J. Arthur Rank would never have made the move from religious education films to the movie industry.\n\nAt least we can give him credit for setting up a studio that would go on to produce six of the ten highest grossest films of all time, a record that the studios in Shenley Road held during the 80s and 90s. Wilcox was long gone by then. He died in 1977, the year that Star Wars, the saviour of Elstree, was released.\n\nJust over 50 years earlier, Wilcox had set up British National Pictures with J.D. Williams and W. Scheslinger, and built a studio in Borehamwood. By that time, Wilcox had already been in the business for seven years, as salesman, distributor, producer, writer and director. Tellingly, Wilcox had no prior interest in movies and only entered the industry as a way to make easy money. He got his first job with his brother Charles, selling American movies to Yorkshire distributors. The Camberwell Casanova would trudge from Barnoldswick to Hackmondwyke, Todmordern to Barnsley in order to persuade cinema owners to the delights of Tarzan and his ilk. But the cinemas weren’t buying the films or serials themselves, but the prospect and promise of forthcoming movies. They were buying films with only a synopsis to go on (in the way that many movies are still pre-sold to foreign markets) and an agreement that they would be ready in two years’ time. Wilcox soon realised the vast financial potential and gave up life on the road to become a distributor himself, rapidly expanding from Yorkshire to London\n\nIt wasn’t long before Wilcox realised that he could double his money by making the films himself, given that distribution didn’t really rely upon the quality of the finished product, but his ability to promote it, to sell its potential. For a man who loved the business of show, a salesman who could persuade a woman to marry him on their first date, the film industry in the 1920s must have seemed like the land of opportunity; an industry susceptible to prophets, not matter how false. Wilcox chose to make his debut as producer with love triangle drama The Wonderful Story, for the good reason that it only needed three actors. Directed by a former exhibitor, George Cutter and with a crew of six and a budget of £1400, it was a critical hit. At least the way that Wilcox tells it: “the reviews were almost embarrassing in their fulsome praise”. A leading article in The Times predicted that “American films had met their Waterloo”. However, with uncharacteristic modesty, Wilcox admits that The Wonderful Story “emptied every cinema at which it was shown ! A ghastly failure with the public.” There was a silver lining, though. He had pre-sold the distribution rights for £4,000, making a 100% profit on his first picture, which proved to be “the financial foundation stone of all my films that followed.” And the good reviews proved profitable, too, giving him leverage to make his next feature Flames Of Passsion. Despite almost burning down the cinema that hosted its premiere with a mock-up of Dante’s Inferno, it was a box office hit, both in the UK and across the Atlantic: “I believe it was the first British film to be sold to the USA after the first World War.” Wilcox concluded that The Wonderful Story had been a flop because “it was a realistic story with a humble cottage setting”, whereas Flames Of Passion was a hit because it “was a florid melodrama, with the Old Bailey reconstructed and a murder scene”. Wilcox’s thoughts went back to the time “when I had gone from one Yorkshire town or village to another, sitting in ill-vented cinemas and being compelled to sit through innumerable films while waiting to see the booking manager, of the dreary uniform Lowry-like tenements with their outside water closets”. And from that memory, he decides “no more stark realism. Audiences have enough of that, and rationing and shortages were still with us. My objective now was escape entertainment of pleasant people doing pleasant things, or highly coloured musical romance.”\n\nAnd Wilcox was true to his word with his next production, and directorial debut, a silent version of the West End musical Chu Chin Chow. Four films later, Wilcox was running his own studio. Whether this would have happened if he hadn’t bankrupted himself by paying Dorothy Gish £1000 a week to play Nell Gwyn is another matter.\n\nWilcox claimed that he finished his historical romp “with literally my last penny”. And then had to edit it. He cut the film himself at home, after cannily purchasing a fire extinguisher, as the nitrate stock was somewhat flammable. And when his electricity was cut off, he completed the edit by candle-light: “the very thought of the risk I took, not only for myself but for others, now horrifies me.” But it was a gamble that paid off. The American film pioneer J.D. Williams and South African entrepreneur W. Schlesinger saw the rough cut and bought the rights, covering the production costs and making the director a tidy £7000 profit before Nell Gwyn was even released. Williams and Schlesinger formed British National Films to distribute the costume drama around the world, and invited Wilcox to join them. Not longer after the film’s box-office bonanza, the newly-minted moguls drove to Borehamwood to inspect the 40 acres of land they’d purchased to build a new studio. Naturally, the first film made at the new Elstree studio was directed by Wilcox and starred Dorothy Gish, Madame Pompadour. But that’s as good as it got for British National Pictures. Wilcox found himself caught in the cross-fire of writs between Williams and Schlesinger, and set up his own company next door. Even though, his time at BNP was short-lived, Wilcox could still make one claim to fame: “I had the pleasure of approving an unheard-of contract of £13,000 a year … to a brilliant young director, Alfred Hitchcock.”\n\nHitch would go on to make Britain’s first sound production, Blackmail in the Shenley Road studio, a few years later. By then the company had changed its name to British International Pictures, and had a new boss, John Maxwell.\n\nSchlesinger returned to South Africa and Williams to Hollywood, where he set up a new production company that was responsible the largest loss of life in any film production. The Viking, a love triangle pot-boiler set in the world of seal hunters, still holds that dubious record, the result of an explosion on board a sealing ship, which killed 25 crew members and the director Varrick Frissell as they were attempting to film an iceberg off the Newfoundland coast. Williams only survived them by a few years, felled, as Matthew Sweet puts it, “by financial worries, a nervous breakdown and two heart attacks.”\n\nJohn Maxwell, a Glaswegian solicitor and film distributor, was brought in initially to arbitrate between J.D. Williams and Isidore Schlesinger, but ended up running the company and changing its name to British International Pictures. Predictably, because of Maxwell’s nationality and frugal nature, Elstree soon become known as The Porridge Factory. Maxwell’s mean streak extended to the studio facilities and equipment, which were considered to be the worst of any of the major film companies in Britain. Unsurprisingly, Maxwell embraced the quota quickie (the unfortunate off-spring of the government’s financial incentive to fill British cinemas with British movies).\n\nUnfortunately he scuppered the main advantage he had over his rivals – owning both a studio and a circuit of cinemas. He made each of his cinemas responsible for returning a profit. And to achieve this, they could do whatever it took, even rejecting films made by their parent company if it wasn’t going to work for their audience. Which meant that Hollywood movies could fill Maxwell’s cinemas and frequently did, leaving Maxwell’s films out in the cold.\n\nEven if they weren’t hits with the critics, the production line of quota quickies and thinly-veiled vehicles for visiting Hollywood stars continued to ring cash tills at the box office. But Maxwell knew that the British film industry had no economic right to exist, and for it to survive, needed a bigger company, a behemoth that dominated both production and distribution. And that behemoth would be his. To achieve this, and to spring an offensive on the American market, he plotted an audacious take-over of his main rival Gaumont in 1936. He was, however, out-foxed by Isidore Ostrer, the equally canny head of Gaumont.\n\nThe Porridge Factory was probably given other, less jolly nick-names once Walter Mycroft was appointed the scenario editor and then head of production. A five foot four inch proto-fascist hunchback and film critic, Mycroft brought his personal politics to bear on his management style and was quickly dubbed “The Tsar Of All The Rushes”, or more earthily, “a shit”.\n\nOddly enough, those soubriquets don’t appear in Mycroft’s autobiography, The Time Of My Life. But the Tsar epiphet is referred to in Vincent Porter’s updated introduction, as well other unfavourable judgements of the head of production by employees and peers alike – “he had a twisted mind and a twisted back”, “one of the most disliked men in films.” Porter defends Mycroft as a misunderstood workaholic who only wanted others to reach the standards that he had set for himself. As for claims of fascism, Porter says there is no firm evidence that Mycroft once learned to fly so that he could be of use to Walter Mosley’s Black Shirts, or that he decamped to Ireland after the war to escape prosecution. Porter also questions Hitchcock’s insistence that he had to leave Elstree because Mycroft was plotting against him.\n\nAs for the autobiography, what we get from the man himself is an insight into his boss, John Maxwell; in individual whose character is often glossed as “he was a very private man.” What we get instead is loving detail of dinners spent together, at Claridge’s or the Reform Club, discussing Maxwell’s “philosophy of life, social and industrial ethics.” Or else, “evenings at the theatre a deux or en famille”, “trips en prince to the continent; special privileges, that engendered special jealousies.” In fact, the whole chapter is a love letter to his old employer, sprinkled with billets doux: “he was 6 foot, strong, solid and silent: he gave one the impression of being a granite statue of himself”, “I had the awe and affection that a storm-trooper might have for a Hitler.” However, the more that he tries to show another side to John Maxwell beyond the racist stereotype of the dour Scottish tightwad, the more he confirms that prejudice. For instance, to show how unpredictable he could be, Mycroft describes the surprise appearance of the boss late on Christmas Eve as the head of production has been slaving away. Maxwell presses a small parcel into his hand as a gesture of his gratitude. Mycroft excitedly goes home to unwrap his Christmas present, only to discover a cigarette lighter embossed with the name of a rival company, Pathe, that would have cost sixpence. Even the description of Maxwell clothes, which Mycroft believes demonstrates his disregard for orthodoxy, only confirms the suspicion that he was too mean to get new ones: “cuffs and collars were often slightly frayed, the tie was untidy… the trousers devoid of crease, and the face never quite clean-shaven.”\n\nMycroft’s unswerving loyalty was rewarded when he was left to run Elstree by himself, with Maxwell checking in once a week, regally gliding through the studio gates in his black Rolls Royce, where he would be ceremoniously greeted by a lackey. Despite what Vincent Porter would like us to believe, Mycroft does himself no favours in his autobiography. He dedicates a whole chapter, titled “Some Of My Best Friends…”, to his views on Jewish colleagues. It contains lines that may well provoke involuntary reactions in contemporary readers, such as “in my experience, the trouble with the Jews is that there are so many nice ones.” He comes across as a pompous, score-settling, anti-Semite and a bit of prig. He dedicates a whole paragraph to his dislike of men who don’t remove their hats whilst engaging in conversation. He is the master of the anecdote without a punchline, which is odd for a man who started out in the industry as a script editor. And for a writer of countless movies, he really doesn’t know how to build audience empathy for his protagonist. That is until the last two pages of the book. It’s 1940, Elstree has been requisitioned for the war effort. Mycroft hasn’t seen “my Chairman” for a while. They reconvene at their favourite restaurant, in Claridges. Mycroft gets their first, but does not recognise the figure walking towards him, “since I had last seen him, my granite idol had melted into softening flesh.” It’s at that moment that he sees his own future, “there was the first hardly-sensed shiver of the loneliness to come. “ And when the two friends meet one last time in Maxwell’s majestic home nestled in the Surrey Hills, the older man whispers “I am going to tell you the story of the tragedy of John Maxwell”. What Maxwell told him that day, he doesn’t say. If there was a revelation, Mycroft dares not speak its name.\n\nWhen Maxwell died in 1940, it was assumed that his family would take over the firm, not least by Maxwell himself. But Maxwell had not counted on death duties. Faced with a crippling tax bill, his widow reluctantly sold half her shares to Warner Brothers, which now meant that the two major studios in Elstree were satellites of Hollywood. On the upside British films were guaranteed distribution in the United States, a distant dream for many British moguls who had so often tried and so frequently failed.\n\nAfter the war, ABPC gained an unenviable reputation amongst actors and directors. According to Richard Attenborough, it was “a dreadful place. It created nothing in terms of a feeling of commitment.” His friend Bryan Forbes agreed, calling it “a rather dismal place, smacking of an industrial site and lacking any real atmosphere.” And yet when you look at the roster of films that ABPC produced – including The Dam Busters, Ice Cold In Alex, Summer Holiday – the mind tends to drift off to Tuesday afternoons home from school. For a certain generation, ABPC turned out some of the finest examples of sick-bed cinema. As a studio for hire, Elstree also produced Kubrick’s British debut, Lolita, and gave Hammer a home after it was kicked out of Bray. And for the first time, thanks to the efforts of Robert Clark , it was making a profit.\n\nIf actors didn’t like ABPC, it was far more attractive to other media companies, because it owned both the means of production and distribution – Elstree Studio and the ABC cinema chain. In 1967, EMI, fat off the profits of Beatlemania, made an aggressive bid for the company. Two years and one enquiry later, EMI finally took control. Like many film moguls, new boss Bernard Delfont did not know much about films, but what he did know was how to make money. So he brought in actor/writer/director Bryan Forbes as head of production.\n\nForbes had run Beaver Films with Attenborough, but he was still an odd choice, and he knew it himself. The verdict on Forbes’ brief tenure is that he flopped. He hogged the limelight, he greenlit one of his own films, The Raging Moon, with his wife, Nanette Newman in the lead, and he was too dictatorial. Brian Blessed remembers walking on the studio lot and seeing Forbes on the march, telling everyone to pick up their fag ends from the floor and reminding them not to drop litter.\n\nBryan Forbes saw it differently. In his autobiography, A Divided Life, he tells his side of the story.\n\nIt all began in the White Elephant, a restaurant in Mayfair, where he was invited to dinner by Delfont, who wanted his honest opinion about the British film industry. A few days later, Forbes produced “a strongly worded document” and almost immediately received the job offer, which he didn’t take seriously. It was only after a third meeting with Delfont that he realised the impresario was not simply flattering him and was now demanding an answer. After a week of deliberations and negotiations with wife Nannette Newman, Forbes “took the plunge, finally convincing myself that it would be an act of supreme hypocrisy to continue as a passionate critic of our native industry in the knowledge that I had passed up an opportunity to do something about its obvious ailments”.\n\nOnce he’d accepted the job, he instantly regretted it. On his first day, Forbes discovered dinosaurs in the boardroom and sharks on the shopfloor. The ABPC executives kept their jobs and with it, their traditions and prejudices. Forbes asked for £800,000 to revamp Elstree, they gave him £80,000. The unions were far more pro-active. Forbes’ story of his first encounter with the shop stewards reads like the script of I’m All Right, Jack or The Angry Silence (which he wrote). Before a word was even spoken, Forbes was handed a piece of paper informing him that as of 5pm, there would be a work to rule and overtime ban (perhaps they had seen The Angry Silence, in which Richard Attenborough stands up valiantly against his union and suffers the consequences, and had certain expectations of their new boss). With an impassioned monologue in which he claimed that he was the only friend they had, the former actor convinced the assembled brethren that he was on their side. The industrial action was called off, though one union leader did knock the personnel manager unconscious on the way out of the building.\n\nIf that story puts Forbes in a good light, then another anecdote in the autobiography unwittingly reveals the level of micro-management that Brian Blessed had observed on his visit to Elstree. In order to boost productivity, Forbes decided to end the tradition of the tea cart, where vats of tea were trundled around the sets and offices at a discounted price. He offered free tea and coffee in return, as along as the workers made the drinks themselves. The resulting negotiations lasted weeks, including definitions of how many free cups of tea were permissible. In the end, Forbes relented and the tea cart was reinstated. But you do wonder whether Forbes really had the tea cart in mind when he declared that he was going to do something about the film industry’s obvious ailments.\n\nYou can see why Forbes may have taken his eye off the ball, and spent much of his valuable time thinking about wage structures and litter and toilet facilities, rather than concentrating on what he had set out to do – create a new order of British cinema. He commissioned a survey of the conditions of the studio, for instance. It concluded that Elstree was not fit for purpose: “nearly every building on the lot was in dire need of renovation. Dressing rooms were a disgrace, filthy dirty and lacking any comfort; in one we found excreta running down the walls from a broken toilet on the floor above. Some of the stage roofs were falling in, the backlot resembled a bomb-site, littered with scrap wood, discarded sets and squalid debris of every conceivable nature.”\n\nHowever, the scripts he received weren’t in a much better state, equally in need of repair. As soon as his appointment was announced, the studio post bag was bulging with unsolicited manuscripts, 400 in the first week. Forbes employed 17 readers to sort through them and discovered 90% were chaff, “dog-eared and hopeless, having done the rounds many times before. Some came with dubious credentials, for I had been in the business long enough to know most of the copper-bottomed charlatans.” At the time, Forbes would have known a good script when he read one, having written a few minor key classics himself – The League Of Gentlemen, The L-Shaped Room and Seance On A Wet Afternoon, each darkly cynical, possibly reactionary, explorations of post-war malaise.\n\nForbes settled on 14 scripts. Two of which were huge hits, The Tales Of Beatrix Potter and the evergreen money-spinner The Railway Children. Another won the Palme D’Or at Cannes, The Go-Between, one of only a handful of British films to achieve that honour. Plus, he commissioned And Soon The Darkness, an atmospheric thriller in which Michelle Dotrice and Pamela Franklin take a cycling holiday in France, only to be pursued by a serial killer whose identity is unmasked at the denouement. Part Agatha Christie whodunit, part proto-slasher movie, it has borne repeated viewings on television very well; so four successes in under two years is not a bad hit rate. Unfortunately there was the case of The Raging Moon and other disasters.\n\nIn his autobiography, Forbes admits that people took against the making of The Raging Moon – a film written, directed and produced by the head of the studio, starring his wife. But he argues that people forget that he didn’t pay himself a salary as writer/director/producer, therefore EMI were getting a bargain, four for the price of one. And he had conscientiously chosen locations that were not too far from his office. He, however, doesn’t seem have fully grasped why people in the industry still wondered how he could do two jobs at once. And this scepticism might well have been behind the refusal by both Rank and ABC to give The Raging Moon house room. The official reason for the rejection was it was neither art-house nor commercial enough for British cinemas, being a low-key love story between two paraplegics. So, Forbes circumvented the traditional circuit, paid for the advertising himself and arranged one-off screenings around the country, including one for the Queen Mother at Warwick Cinema. And even though she gave it her blessing, The Raging Moon never got a proper release in this country. Just as galling for Forbes would have been the fact that EMI were distributing Get Carter at the same time. In his first press conference as studio head, he railed against “the pornography of violence” in modern cinema, and promised a slate of family-friendly movies. Get Carter had been memorably described by critic George Melly as a “bottle of neat gin swallowed before breakfast” and was doing rather nicely in picturehouses across the country.\n\nThere was one consolation for the beleaguered boss, though. Even if it didn’t get released, The Raging Moon at least got made. Which is more than can be said of A Fine And Private Place, the first star vehicle Forbes had commissioned for his wife, which was hastily abandoned mid-way through production. Making good on his promise that he was going to give young talent its head, Forbes gave carte blanche to a film-maker whose previous experience was confined to TV documentaries. The disaster unfolded hundreds of miles away from studio supervision, on the wet coast of North Cornwall, where days were lost due to storms and what footage had been shot wouldn’t cut together. A third of the budget had been spent on ten minutes of screen time, little of which made narrative sense. Forbes was only alerted to the fact by a phone call from his wife. Arriving on set, he witnessed the carnage for himself – a young director drunk on auteur theory and an experienced crew biting their collective lip. After only two days in Cornwall, Forbes decided to wrap up production and blame the film’s premature end on inclement weather.\n\nForbes didn’t seem to learn his lesson though. He packed John Hurt and a small crew off to Antarctica to film Mr Forbush And The Penguins, about a naturalist who “becomes manically obsessed to save helpless penguin chicks from predatory skua gulls.” Once at the south pole, there would be no communication between the film-makers and the studio, and worse, the rushes could only be processed once they got back, since the supply ship only called every three months. You can guess what happened next. Unfortunately, Bryan Forbes did not. When he finally saw the rushes, he realised that the footage of penguins in their natural habitat shot by one director did not sit comfortably with the dramatic scenes shot by another. Plus, the financiers were not happy with the performance of the leading lady, so she would have to be replaced, as would the director. It was down to Bryan Forbes to break it to John Hurt that he would have to do it all over again. Hurt, quite understandably, refused; so Forbes plied him with expensive brandy until he finally relented. It was a waste of both the actor’s time and a bottle of good brandy, because Forbush barely made it to its natural habitat, rarely spotted in cinemas.\n\nYou might assume from this series of schoolboy errors that when Forbes finally left in 1971 he had been given the boot. And indeed, there were press reports to that effect. What really happened was that the director had called an emergency meeting with Lord Delfont to back him in his internecine struggles with the board. However, as soon as the word resignation had passed Forbes’ lips, it was hastily accepted. By the time of his greatest victory, the triumph of The Go-Between at Cannes, Bryan Forbes had already left the studio, cursing it more than he ever did when he was a jobbing actor.\n\nBy the end of 1973, EMI-Elstree was in such a mess that producer Andrew Mitchell was brought in to close it down, to play the part of the hatchet man. According to his son, Andy, Mitchell had other ideas. Unlike Forbes, he had fond memories of the studio, having started his career in ABPC in the early 60s on a couple of Cliff Richard pics. And while he kept the studio going with all-star productions of Murder On The Orient Express and Are You Being Served ?, salvation came in the unlikely form of a science fiction movie with a script considered infantile and incomprehensible, with dialogue so wooden that it once lead its star to comment “you can type this shit, George, but you sure can’t say it”. It was a film that was losing the faith of its Hollywood backers and couldn’t find a studio large or cheap enough to shoot in. The producers scoured Europe for such a place. It was lucky for Elstree that it met both criteria. With no other takers, Andrew Mitchell could offer the freedom of the studio. Star Wars could take over all the sound stages.\n\nMitchell was one of the first people outside of George Lucas’ inner circle to read the script of Star Wars. From the outside, this would seem to be a momentous occasion, a first glimpse of the future of modern American cinema. In reality, Mitchell didn’t know what to make of a document punctuated with vague references to special effects that were clearly playing in Lucas’ head, but nobody else’s. Once filming had started, there was a clash of cultures between young tyro and old hands, but Lucas began to appreciate the dedication to craft in the British film industry. As well as the initial trilogy, Lucas also brought his Indiana Jones productions to Borehamwood, where Steven Spielberg grew to love the quality of the fake rocks. Nobody did them beter. And it was because of the Raiders franchise and the Star Wars trilogy, that at one point six of the ten highest grossing movies of all time were made in Elstree.\n\nIn the ensuing purple patch, Stanley Kubrick returned with The Shining, where The Overlook Hotel was built, and then re-built when a huge fire turned a sound stage into cinders. Nobody died on that shoot, but the fish that once lived in the studio reservoir were not so lucky. They all expired when gallons of fake blood from the elevator scene were poured into their tank.\n\nIf the story of Elstree’s unlikely come-back and plucky victory was the stuff of fairy tales, or space operas, then what happened next is the dark sequel, The Empire Strikes Back of this long-runing saga.\n\nThe owners of Cannon, cousins Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus would never have considered themselves an evil Empire. They were the self-styled mavericks of Hollywood, the stars of their own buddy movie, the archetypal mix of chalk and cheese. Golam was the ideas man, too many ideas it transpired, the dreamer, the movie obsessive who put his own new-born baby at risk just to get a shot. Globus was the hard-headed businessman, the bottom line guy who initially had no truck with fancy offices or expense account lunches. Lunch was often eaten during business meetings in their cramped headquarters. What united the two men was the love of a deal and volcanic displays of temper. The suspicion that their career was one long performance was confirmed each year at Cannes, where they promenaded in matching and unflattering blue tracksuits, followed everywhere by documentary crews.\n\nThey must have been secretly pleased when a documentary, Electric Boogaloo, was made about them in 2014 ; they even commissioned their own, The Go-Go Boys to get into cinemas before the unofficial version. And just before Golan died on August 8th.\n\nElstree is only a small part of the Golam/Globus story. In the 1970s, Menahem Golan was basically the Israeli film industry. Three out of four movies from that country were produced by him. And he would have probably remained that big fish in a little pond if it hadn’t been for a teen movie that finally gave its horny, hormonal audience what they wanted – full frontal nudity, shower scenes, locker room chat. Lemon Popsicle was a global phenomenon and its world-wide box office receipts allowed Golan and Globus to purchase Cannon Films, an equally high-class outfit who had profited from The Happy Hooker and its sequel The Happy Hooker Goes To Washington.\n\nCannon’s modus operandi was not unlike Herbert Wilcox’s in the 1920s – they would sell a film to distributors based on an idea often made up on the spot by Golan. A film would only become a reality if it had the requisite amount of pre-sales. Cannon were also dedicated followers of fashion, whether that fashion was space operas, kung fu, arm wrestling or break dancing. And if a film could encompass not one but two trends, then all the better. Hence, Ninja 3: The Domination, in which a part-time aerobics instructor is possessed by the evil spirit of a dead ninja warrior.\n\nA typical Cannon film would have almost everything, except good taste. And so Golan and Globus were the perfect partners for Michael Winner and his Death Wish series\n\nThe budgets were so low that Cannon could absorb the blows of a few box-office flops, such as Golan’s own surrealist musical The Apple. And as their business was built entirely upon pre-sales, they were always in the black in the years between income (the pre-sale) and out-going (the production) – something else that Maxwell had discovered five decades earlier. They played the percentages, making so many movies a year that one of them would have to hit box office gold, so for every Mata Hari or Dr Heckyl And Mr Hype, there would be a money-spinner like Chuck Norris’ Missing In Action\n\nAll was going well for Golan and Globus, very well, until they came into some money. Boosted by the investment of a bonds salesman, their ambitions grew and their tastes improved, with disastrous consequences. It was at this point they bought ABPC cinemas and Elstree studios, giving them immediate domination of the British market.\n\nAndrew Mitchell tried to fight the take-over and suffered a heart attack for his troubles. He was joined in his crusade by councillor and film buff Paul Welsh. Save Our Studios barely had time to gain momentum when Cannon self-combusted. As well as buying film libraries and studios across Europe, Cannon tried to buy some respectability. And while they partially succeeded, with The Assault and The Runaway Train, they also bank-rolled auteurs down on their luck and living off their faded reputations, such as John Frankenheimer, Barbet Schroeder and Jean-Luc Godard. But at least these flops were low in budget. Cannon really came a cropper when they tried to compete with the major studios by buying the rights to Superman from the Salkind brothers. The 30 million dollar budget for Superman IV – The Quest For Peace would once have paid for 30 Cannon movies. It certainly wasn’t 30 times better than the average Cannon product. Part of the problem was that Golan and Globus could never relinquish their old ways, insisting on doing everything on the cheap, that Milton Keynes could easily double for the United Nations, for instance. Superman IV only made half of its money back. Faced with bankruptcy, The Go Go Boys went their separate ways. Golan formed 21st Century Film Company while Globus stayed with Cannon. Like its own bad superhero movie, the two best friends became mortal enemies. Their battlefield was the fleapits of Europe. Their first conflict could be known as the Lambada Wars. Both made movies about the short-lived 80’s dance craze. Golan won the right to use the hit song Lambada by Kaoma, but Globus registered the title with the MPAA first. Golan had to settle for The Forbidden Dance and cast a former Miss USA as the princess of a Brazilian tribe who uses her dancing talents to highlight the plight of the Amazon rainforest on American television.\n\nThe dance was also used for the benefit of society in Lambada, in which a high school teacher used his dancing talents to educate a gang of teenage drop-outs.\n\nBoth films were released on the same day, with Globus winning a significant victory over his ex-partner, with Lambada making more than twice much as The Forbidden Dance at the box-office.\n\nTo recoup some of their losses, Cannon had a fire sale of their recent acquisitions. Elstree Studios were snapped up by Brent Walker, a leisure giant who at various times owned Goldcrest Films, Brent Cross shopping centre and Southend Pier. Act in haste, repent in leisure may well have been their motto, as supremo George Walker quickly realised that the property came with few mod cons and a £150 million debt. To pay it off, he decided to sell the most valuable asset Elstree had – the land. The twelve acre back lot was to be sold to Tesco, to create the second largest supermarket in the country. The rest was to be sold off in pieces. For instance, the chairs went for £10 a pop. The remaining employees hid the chairs in the first aid centre and returned them to their offices for meetings with prospective clients. It was at this point that Andrew Mitchell had to bow out, through illness. Paul Welsh continued the campaign, and with some style. He enlisted the help of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who became patrons of Save Our Studios. Spielberg took time off from directing Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade to address a group of MPs about the need to keep the historic facilities.\n\nThis heavyweight support for the burgeoning movement resulted in TV crews from around the world descending upon Borehamwood to report on this modern adaptation of David versus Goliath. Unused to being in the spotlight, local politicians gave in to media pressure. Hertsmere Council threatened Brent Walker with a compulsory purchase order and they finally offered the studios to the council for knock down price. After an 8 year pitched battle, the studio was saved, or at least half of it. The other half is still a supermarket. The council still own the studios, but act as landlord, with Elstree Studios Ltd as their tenants. An Oscar winner, The King’s Speech, was made on the premises, as was The World’s End; but Elstree is now more of a home for television productions: Dancing On Ice, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice, Pointless but also a TV comedy that wouldn’t have looked out of place in the 70s alongside Are You Being Served ?\n\nAt one point, EMI Elstree and MGM were joined at the hip, or at least at management level, the result of a merger, which left Bryan Forbes the reluctant guvnor of two major studios. And when one studio had to be sacrificed for reasons of financial health and efficiency, it was assumed it was EMI that would go dark, being the worst equipped studio in London.\n\nMGM, on the other hand, was built in the image of a Hollywood studio. When the American company took over the premises in 1947 (from Rank, who had sequestered it from Soskin Brothers), they added a dash of glamour, plus greenhouses, restaurants and gold-plated stars like Spencer Tracey, Elizabeth Taylor and Clark Gable. With operations being directed from Culver City, MGM British anticipated the torrid love affair between Britain and Hollywood in the 1960s.\n\nAfter decades of trying to get Hollywood studios to notice they even existed, only to be rejected by the coquettish Yanks, Britain finally caught their eye in the early 60s, suddenly becoming as Alexander Walker put it “a kept woman”. By 1966, for example, 75% of British movies were funded out of the pockets of wealthy Americans.\n\nAnd it’s easy to see Britain’s sudden appeal in the 1960s, the result of a chic make-over – mop-tops, Saville Row suits, Bond, the Beatles, swinging London – energies that also pulsated through the new wave of the Free Cinema – Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner, A Taste Of Honey.\n\nAt the same time, American cinema was doing the time warp, with the fall of Roman epics like Cleopatra and big budget musicals out of step with the era. The moguls fiddled while Hollywood burned. Their movies certainly did not swing. According to Alexander Walker’s Hollywood, England, it was “clamped rigidly between the hypocrisies of the Production Code and the ratings administration on the one hand and on the other, the pressure-groups, secular and religious, who were still trying to impose a consensus attitude that was everywhere disintegrating into sensation seeking culture.” America, for once, seemed like the old country, steadfastly following the Pilgrims’ way.\n\nIn 1965, the Yanks invaded – Fox, Columbia, Embassy and many others set up bases in London. Michael Balcon for one was worried about the consequences of the financial domination going unchecked, which could prove a “threat to the continuation of truly British production industry.” One executive noted “anything you like to name as British is going out there.” As Walker says in Hollywood, England, “they were clutching at straws as long as they were made in Britain.” But many were British in name only – international co-productions with say, a British comedian, a European starlet, and an American leading man with a supporting cast of ageing English gentlemen whose main job was to twinkle and flirt with the European starlet. David Niven was in his element.\n\nUnfortunately, the American infatuation began just as the British film industry was experiencing Second Album Syndrome – the-what-do-we-do-now hangover that often follows unexpected success. And like many second albums, what they produced was often indisciplined, self-indulgent and self-congratulatory. Films didn’t come more pleased with themselves than Help !, What’s New Pussycat and Casino Royale.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the Americans to catch up and match that initial British swagger and verve. Bonnie And Clyde, In The Heat Of The Night, The Graduate, Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner were all released in the same year. And all were nominated for best picture Oscar. 1967 was an annus mirabilis for American cinema.\n\nOr so it seemed. True, there were young moguls like Robert Evans and Richard Zanuck, but the old men still retained power in the other major studios and still clung to the old ways. According to Walker, “they sent their money abroad just as audiences were discovering the excitements of home”. And what they were producing in this country were the types of films British cinema had seemed to be a reaction against. Old Hollywood still carried on like the 1960s had never happened, funnelling money into big budget musicals like Dr Doolittle and Half A Sixpence. As late as 1969, the year of Easy Rider, MGM made an ill-considered musical adaptation of Goodbye Mr Chips; plot – shy schoolmaster falls for music hall star; songs – Fill The World With Love, What A Lot Of Flowers. Audiences naturally fled. As they did with another MGM would-be blockbuster, Alfred The Great, which tried hard to convince the new youth audience that the Saxon warrior was a counter-culture hero.\n\nThe old moguls continued as if there was nothing wrong with their roster, their formulae just needed a shot in the arm, a certain attitude and energy that could be mined from British culture.\n\nMGM did, to be fair, produce 2001: A Space Odyssey; although even that was blamed for its part in Elstree’s downfall, as Kubrick’s production did take up all available studio space for over a year.\n\nAnd by 1967, the new wave British directors were making films that, compared to their American counterparts seemed, in the words of Alexander Walker, “in-bred, remote, effete”. They abandoned the kitchen sink for dead divas (Isadora), glorious military defeats (The Charge Of The Light Brigade), modish literary adaptations (Far From The Madding Crowd) – all set in the past. The global success of Tom Jones and A Hard Day’s Night, and the attendant euphoria, had masked a downward trend in cinema attendance. Cool Britannia was a chimera, a mass hallucination produced by wish fulfilment and silly money – in reality, only London swung, the British New Wave consisted of four directors, television had taken over where they left off, while audiences were making the switch from big to small screen.\n\nBy 1970 such was the over-spend on big budget fiascos that Hollywood looked it might go into administration. The signs were all there – Hollywood was facing bankruptcy yet spending more money on more productions, the too big to fail policy that had worked so well in the flush fifties. America itself was feeling the pinch. In 1968, President Johnson announced the curtailment of US investments in Europe in order to assist America’s balance of payments. It was then that the British film industry started to get the fear.Those fears were realised two years later.\n\nBy 1970, most of the studios had closed their London offices, while MGM appointed James Aubrey as their head.\n\nKnown as the smiling cobra, Aubrey had a one-track mind and a catch-phrase, “everybody has a fear level.” In the United States, he fired 3,500 employees and turned off the heating in the Thalberg building. As Bryan Forbes explains, Aubrey “came to England with the express purpose of closing the MGM studios at Borehamwood”, but tried to mask the bitter truth with the appearance of a merger, which left Forbes with the task of telling the workers at MGM British that they had lost their jobs – “it was one of the saddest jobs I ever had to perform”.\n\nLegend has it that MGM left the buildings in just 47 minutes, as if it was a dress rehearsal for the evacuation of Saigon five years later. Like some modern version of Marie Celeste, the company left everything in their wake – stills, props, furniture, even the scaled-down chateau from Where Eagles Dare. To fear something is one thing, but to experience it is another. Everybody who worked in MGM, who’d heard the rumours on the grapevine, seemed genuinely shocked when the news broke. The studio was eventually knocked down, the sets of 2001 broken up and scattered, but the proposed housing estate failed planning regulations, and for many decades, the site was home to a huge storage facility.\n\nSo that leaves us with just one studio, as we return to Herbert. We left him just as he resigned from the studio that he’d helped to build. In true Wilcox fashion, he immediately set up another company and built a studio in the grounds of his old one. British and Dominions Film Corporation was formed with the help of Nelson Keys, a musical comedy star of stage and screen who made his movie debut as the titular character in Drowsy Dick’s Dream (1909) and Drowsy Dick Dreams He’s A Burglar (1910).\n\nAs with all of Wilcox’s film companies, he did not stay with British And Dominion for very long, like a parent who constantly runs away from home. But in those nine years, he managed to anger the censor on both sides of the Atlantic. Dawn (1928), a bio-pic of Edith Cavell, the British nurse executed by the Germans in World War I, faced its own firing squad in the form of the BBFC, who banned it on the grounds that it might damage the relationship between the two former enemies. Even the unlikely alliance of Lord Beaverbrook and George Bernard Shaw failed to move the British censor. It was, however, shown in the capital after the London County Council voted to approve its screening, with a majority of one.\n\nNell Gwynn (1934), the remake of the costume drama Wilcox had directed eight years earlier, was no less controversial in the United States. One of the thirty odd collaborations with Anna Neagle, it was refused the Seal of approval by the Purity League for revealing too much of Neagle’s cleavage, amongst other offences. To appease the censor, it was suggested that a new ending could be tacked on – Nell in rags, sprawled on the street, with the caption “Nell Gwynn lived as she must and died as she must – in the gutter.” And although, Wilcox didn’t take up the suggestion, the coda was shot by another director for the American market. In response, Wilcox resigned from his own company. And almost immediately formed a new one, a British off-shoot of Universal Pictures. As part of the negotiations, a producer of religious education pictures was brought in as a potential partner. Wilcox, of course, takes the credit for J.Arthur Rank joining the British film industry, and for his subsequent dominance of that industry. The deal he struck “proved to be the cornerstone of the Rank Empire.” Yet, Wilcox initially refused to be part of Rank’s new studios at Pinewood. After being granted a personal tour, Herbert concluded that he didn’t like “the endless number of offices, all of which I felt would house secretaries and office boys. Up would go the overheads and the costs of film production.” It was while he was considering his future over a cigarette in the garden of his home high on Elstree hill that he noticed a red glow in the sky. His studio was on fire.\n\nExamining the smouldering ruins in the morning, he realised that he would have to decamp to Pinewood after all: “and once again I opened a new British film studio, when I made London Melody.”\n\nHerbert then set up his own company, Herbert Wilcox Productions, and enjoyed more than twenty years of unparalleled success. And although titles like I Live In Grosvenor Square, Piccadilly Incident, The Courtneys Of Curzon Street and Odette no longer trip off the tongue, they were the movies on every film-goers lips in the 40s and early 50s. Their financial success enabled the director to line his Park Lane flat with Old Masters like Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renoir and Gaugin. And yet in 1964, Herbert Wilcox was declared bankrupt. What went wrong ? Mainly, it was his decision to invest in the company that was distributing his movies, that was taking 50% of his profits. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Except that the company was British Lion, the Jonah of the national film industry. It had already dashed the dreams of Alexander Korda and Michael Balcon, and would destroy the career of Stanley Baker. When British Lion went into the red, the value of Wilcox shares went from £100,000 to not a penny. Not only that, Anna lost most of her savings by ploughing them into Fred Astaire’s School Of Dancing. Wilcox was also a victim of bad timing. His production of the naval drama Yangste Incident was released the same week as another naval drama, The Battle Of The River Plate, “in my mind an inferior film” but nevertheless victorious at the box office. As well as failing to make the expected £400,000 profit, Yangste Incident never even recouped its production costs. Wilcox thought he had found a way out of his troubles by writing Terence Rattigan a personal cheque for £100,000 for the rights to Ross, his play about T.E. Lawrence. But when Herbert publically announced his plans to make a biopic of Lawrence Of Arabia, he was threatened with an injunction by producer Sam Spiegel, who had already lined up David Lean to do exactly the same thing.\n\nTo pay off their debts, Wilcox put up his BAFTA awards for auction and sold the Park Lane flat. He would wake up every morning and anxiously and quietly make his way to the letter box to discover what bad news the postman had just delivered and proceed to tear up all the debtors’ letters without opening them.\n\nBizarrely, Wilcox and Neagle decided that their only hope was to put on a show. Bizarre, because the last time that Neagle starred in a West End production, in 1952, she was booed by a small section of the audience. As the star was a national treasure, a member of showbiz royalty, her public barracking made front page headlines, and The Glorious Days only lasted 8 months, collateral damage from the bad publicity.\n\nThis new production, Charlie Girl, didn’t exactly start well. The set was initially too big for the theatre that was housing it, and couldn’t be fitted through the stage doors. Some of the scenery crashed onto the stage and the designer was hospitalised with a head injury. The pressure was too much for Wilcox, and the strain too much for his heart. The subsequent coronary laid him out in hospital throughout rehearsals; during that time, he imagined his own obituary and convinced Neagle that it was just a chest infection, and he only finally let on when they swigged champagne in his hospital bed after a triumphant opening night. The production broke office records for the theatre and eased the couple out of bankruptcy in 1966. And this is the point where Twenty Five Thousand Sunsets comes to its end. Wilcox adds a coda to his autobiography and talks of feeling the same spirit and enthusiasm as he did when he entered the industry, looking forward to his next picture, and remembering the advice from Alexander Korda: “Herbert – one film can make a company.” Even though he lived for another 11 years, Herbert Wilcox never directed another movie. The come-back king, the Camberwell Casanova, did not ride again.\n\nDenham was not so much a film studio as a monument to the man who built it. If you can say that any building was created in the image of its maker, then Denham Studios was the spit of Alexander Korda – awe-inspiring, self-consciously grand and totally impractical. Korda’s biographer, Charles Drazin, has dubbed him “Britain’s only mogul”, which seems a little harsh on, say, J. Arthur Rank and Isidore Ostrer, both of whom were far more successful than Korda, a man who lived royally beyond his means until the end of his days. Perhaps Korda was the mogul’s mogul, the ur-mogul: visionary, chameleon, charlatan, hustler, liar, artist, opportunist, magician and magus. He was the very definition of a show-man.\n\nEven Korda’s name was a classic piece of misdirection. Born Kellner Sandor to a Jewish family in the Hungarian plains, he took the pseudonym Korda Sandor as an 18 year old reporter for a Budapest paper. The name was taken from the Catholic mass – Sursum Corda, meaning Lift Up Your Hearts. He finally christened himself Alexander Korda eight years later, after he’d escaped a right wing coup in his home country, crossed the border to Vienna and signed in to a swish hotel. He thought Sandor might make him sound too much like a Hungarian refugee, of which there many in Vienna at that time. And it was as Alexander Korda that he made his name as director/producer in Vienna, Berlin, Hollywood and finally London. And it was in this country that the travelling show-man finally found his audience, a film industry waiting for their man. And Korda ticked all their boxes: someone who had reinvented himself, who could disguise his religion but not his ambition, someone who thought big and talked bigger. In other words, a Hollywood mogul in all but nationality and manners.\n\nFrom very early on, Korda seems have to understood that only the superficial don’t judge by appearances. He would take the finest rooms in the best hotels, no matter if he could afford them, make firm friends with the concierge and after a few weeks start tapping him for loans. He instinctively realised that only a few people could see your bank balance, but everybody could see your silk shirts, famously shiny shoes and bespoke suit; or if they visited your house, they could easily be distracted by the Picassos hanging on the wall and foie gras imported from Paris; if they went to your office, the marble steps and sweeping staircase. As his nephew Michael said of him “Alex always believed in display”. He was even talked of at the time as if he was a magician, as a man “who could charm money from an empty safe”.\n\nLike all magicians, his powers of persuasion were infamous, his charisma legendary. In first job at a Budapest studio he soon learned that “you can get somebody else to put up all the money, still own half of it yourself and manage it as you please.” Michael Korda goes onto call his uncle a “born manipulator of money”. He certainly made accountancy the art of smoke and mirrors. When he was head of London Studios, his most elaborate trick was to buy titles (best-selling books etc) to claim as assets, potential earnings to off-set the debts of his numerous big-budget flops; but the ruse only worked if the titles retained their potential, if they counted as future profits, so they could never become actual films, otherwise they would lose their value. Similarly actors were placed on long contracts and immediately placed on lucrative loans to rival studios; subsidiary companies only existed on paper, conjured up to conceal missing funds.\n\nOne of the best ways to display your own wealth is to be seen with wealthier friends. Whether it was Churchill or the Maharajah of Mysore or minor royals, Korda didn’t just cultivate the rich and the powerful, as collect them. Everywhere he went, whether it was Vienna, Berlin or London, Alexander Korda always rose to the top. He would sought out royalty as if they were truffle, hired debutantes as extras, employed Winston Churchill to write scripts that would never pass the lips of actors, and disastrously gave carte blanche to HG Wells on the adaptation of Things To Come – the novelist’s dull, laborious dialogue rubbed up the wrong way against the gleaming, futuristic designs of Korda’s brother Vincent.\n\nKorda’s ultimate act of display was Denham, a vanity project of a man whose vanity was legendary. As fellow Hungarian director Andre De Toth observed, when he “spoke to people he didn’t see them. He saw himself next to them in the mirror.” Once he’d set up London Films in 1932, he needed his own palace, with its own court where the Korda dynasty (director Zoltan and designer Vincent) could rule and Hungarian exiles could gratefully receive hand-outs like indentured servants. Alexander couldn’t stay in Isleworth, which still bore the imprint of another mogul, GB Samuelson, and a failed mogul at that, who’d left the film industry to set up a lending library in Worthing. Denham was built to impress, with Vincent designing the exteriors as if it was a set itself. The River Colne was diverted to make a small pond outside Korda’s office and Churchill supplied the swans, once permission had been gained from the royal family. According to Charles Drazin, “the extensive grounds boasted stables, a boathouse and the Fisheries. The seven sound stages with their electrically controlled doors occupied 118,800 square feet of floor space. There were two projection theatres and eighteen cutting-rooms. The power plant generated enough electricity to supply a town the size of York. Over 2,000 staff worked there and, each week the restaurant – known by the workers as ‘Snobs’ because of the glamourous people you could see eating there – cooked 50,000 sausages.” It was said to be the largest studio in Europe at the time.\n\nPress tours would have marvelled at the antiques in Korda’s office, a hall large enough to house a full orchestra and the largest generating plant in Europe, not to mention the stars who orbited the studio; stars who owed their global fame to Korda, like Laurence Olivier, Vivienne Leigh and, particularly Merle Oberon, the Anglo-Indian actress formerly known as Estelle Merle O’Brien Thompson, who was given a new birthplace, Tasmania, and new parents, a French-Dutch teacher and English army officer by Korda, her future lover.\n\nAs ever, little of this came out of Alex’s own pocket. Once again he found a way for somebody else to cough up the money, while retaining control himself. He got the Prudential to pay for it. Or rather he persuaded the government to get the Pru to pay for it. The insurance company had over a million pound a week to invest from their profits and the British government was keen that so much money did not stray abroad. It’s not known how exactly the government persuaded the company to invest, but Korda’s powerful friends and connections must have exerted some influence, otherwise what would be the point of having powerful friends and connections.\n\nWhich is not to say that Korda was a superior con artist. He was also a visionary film-maker with a yen for spectaculars (more display) and an eye for the epic. With The Private Life Of Henry VIII, he gambled everything on his first British feature – his reputation, his new film company and other people’s money. As it happened, it turned out to be exactly the thing that the film industry had been trying to make for years, a British subject in the Hollywood style; but had significantly failed. Unlike its contemporaries, it travelled well, particularly across the Atlantic. The Private Life Of Henry VIII arrived at a time when the British film industry was essentially stalking the American studios, needily seeking its company; when Michael Balcon at Gainsborough was shuttling between London and Los Angeles fruitlessly seeking co-production deals, when breaking into the American market was the holy grail of a British film industry that couldn’t exist on such a large scale with such a small market as the local one. Korda had not only worked in Hollywood, but he first came to this country to head up the Paramount office in London. When he started London Films, he soon became a partner at United Artists, an equal of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford.\n\nHow much the star-struck members of the British film industry knew about Korda’s experiences in Hollywood is a moot point. He didn’t arrive in LaLa land as a recognised European auteur, but as the husband of the actress of Maria Korda, who’d just won her first Hollywood contract. He was part of the package, the lowly director of her star vehicles, a member of her service industry. And he was treated as such, until his contract with Fox was abruptly terminated at the screening of The Princess And The Plumber. Production supervisor (and consummate bully) Sol Wurtzel brought his 12 year old son to see Korda’s latest potboiler, and once the credits had rolled, the child’s opinion was solicited. “It stinks” was the boy’s critical assessment. “You heard the kid,” Wurtzel grunted, “It stinks. You’re through.”\n\nSimilarly, the good will surrounding his deal with United Artists seemed to evaporate in the LA sun when his partners realised the extent of Korda’s debts. When Alex asked for a loan, Mary Pickford, for one, was not best pleased: “Personally , I closed Pickford-Lasky and went out of business rather than make such a request to my fellow stockholders”, she harrumphed. Despite her objections, United Artists offered Korda the loan, but with so many strings attached that the director couldn’t possibly accept. By now, he’d come to the conclusion that the reason London Films was in debt, and close to liquidation, wasn’t due to the quality of his product but because of the way that United Artists had been distributing them in the States, dumping them in unsuitable cinemas like so much toxic waste. The company responded by stating that “English-made pictures did not enjoy a profitable vogue”. Typically, Korda decided not to fight UA, but to buy them out and when that failed, he announced he was going to sue his partners, an announcement that was rapidly retracted. In turn, United Artists commissioned a report on Denham. What they found was the wrong kind of dream factory – contracts drawn up and torn up, debts growing like knotweed, a boss who could not delegate, who treated every major decision he made like an official secret. If only he concentrated on making films “he could make a fortune for the company”, but like a lot of single-minded people, Alex could never focus on just one thing at a time. In this case, the report concluded, “his mind is mixed up with various promoting and financial problems such as studios, printing, laboratories.“ As with so many charismatic people, he’d fallen prey to his own superficial charm and had talked himself into rapid over-expansion, knowing that the more ambitious his plans, the more cash would flow from the Pru. The concrete reality was that he now had a studio he couldn’t fill with his own productions alone; he would have to find other productions and other production companies. He would be less like a mogul and more like a studio manager. On his first visit of the completed studio, Korda admitted “I have made my greatest mistake”.\n\nAnd there was another problem with Denham. As a monument to its owner, it was appropriately palatial and significantly grandiose. But as a working film studio, it didn’t work. The largest power plant in Europe was situated right next to a sound studio, which meant that “extra precautions had to be taken to ensure that the loud humming could not be heard on the stages”, according to Drazin. And if they managed to dim the hum from the generators, there was the small matter of Denham airfield nearby, which would provide its own sound effects. (And I passed that aerodrome on the South Bucks Way, as a small plane took off just above my head. “The plane that flattens my hair”, I warbled to myself). Historian Colin Sorensen in his radio documentary A Child In King Arthur’s Court recounts an anecdote about an intimate scene between Mary Morris and Leslie Howard in Pimpernel Smith being interrupted 22 times by the persistent drone of aircraft. And as Charles Drazin points out, there was another local difficulty – the studio was squeezed between the river Colne and the Uxbridge Road. Long and thin is not the ideal shape for a studio and it could mean a quarter of a mile walk to the canteen, but more importantly, the prop stores were nowhere near the studios, and even Drazin admits “Denham really was a model of how not to build an efficient film studio.” A few years later when Celia Johnson filmed Brief Encounter there, she referred to “the awful factory dreariness of Denham”, a world away from the Xanadu that had been promised a decade earlier. The building of Denham began in the boom of 1935 and was finally completed at the beginning of the bust in 1936. This was exactly the wrong time for Korda to produce two of his most high profile disasters, I, Claudius and Elephant Boy.\n\nYou could at least see the logic behind I, Claudius: Charles Laughton as another megalomaniac head of state, that same mix of epic and excess that garnered its lead an Oscar and its director a box office bonanza. But Korda soon abandoned his post as director after threatening Laughton with legal action for non-appearance. Perhaps this recovered memories of the filming of The Private Life Of Henry VIII when his capricious star would often decide he wasn’t in the mood to act just as the director called “Action !”. Korda enlisted a very different type of director, temperamentally the polar opposite, the stick to his carrot. Joseph Von Sternberg was the definition of the director as great dictator, with his breeches, polished riding boots and will of iron. He turned out to be exactly the wrong director for a star who liked to agonise over the motivations and minutae of his character. The wrong director to wait patiently as his star would decide which leg he was going to limp with this take. The wrong director to bite his lip as Laughton refused to act on the part of the stage set up for the shot and insist on another space where the aura was more favourable to his emanations. A car crash involving co-star Merle Oberon put everyone out of their misery; some believe it was a happy accident, the actress was not seriously or visibly injured but it offered a way out, an excuse for the production to end and insurance company to pay out, but not enough to cover the gargantuan costs already racked up.\n\nAt least Elephant Boy was completed, if not as originally intended in the sub-continent of India, but in South Buckinghamshire. Director Robert Flaherty specialised in his own brand of inauthentic ethnography, hauling his camera to remote communities where he would reconstruct the lives of the inhabitants and shape them into Hollywood narratives. His 1922 documentary Nanook Of The North made a global star of its Inuit hero (even down to a name change) with ice-creams, drinks and a line of furs bearing his non-de-plum. The words Eskimo and igloo became a part of the lingo. His 1934 documentary Man Of Aran, was less successful. In fact, it was so unsuccessful that it became known as Balcon’s Folly, after its producer Michael Balcon. But this did not deter Korda, in fact it might have spurred him on. Like a football manager who believes he’s the only one who can tame a difficult prodigy, Korda signed Flaherty to make an adaptation of Kipling’s story. The director immediately headed to India, to immerse himself in the local culture. Eight months later with no progress report, and with the Prudential asking difficult questions, the producer sent his brother Zoltan on a fact-finding mission. What he found was a film without a story, 55 hours of verite footage of the daily life of a village. Korda decided to impose a story and the structure on the material, use some of the Indian footage as a travelogue and film the main parts of the story in the studio. Large parts of the sub-continent were re-created on the banks of the River Colne, with the help of a bamboo forest and elephants hired from London zoo. Elephant Boy made a star of Sabu, and took an impressive $100,000 at the box office. It would have been a bona fide hit, if it hadn’t cost $150,000.\n\nIt was after these two financial disasters that the Prudential called time on this shotgun marriage. An insurance company was always an unlikely partner for a reckless gambler like Korda, being, by their nature, risk-averse. Denham was to be amalgamated with Pinewood; London Films would run the studio and nothing else. Korda was paid off to start his own production company. During the negotiations, the Prudential were clearly wary of (and even spooked by) Alex’s powers. “Korda’s engaging personality and charm of manner must be resisted”, warned the Pru’s secretary Percy Crump in an internal memo, as if the producer was some Edwardian arch-villain blessed with hypnotic powers, “His financial sense is non-existent and his promises (even when they are sincere) worthless … Korda is a very dominant man and also very dangerous to converse with owing to (among other things) his powers of persuasion.” But resist them, they did. Alex didn’t even have the opportunity to clear his desk, but endured a far greater humiliation when he returned to make The Thief Of Baghdad – he had to return his old office, and as Drazin puts it, “walk among his staff – most of whom were no longer his staff.”\n\nWith hindsight, Korda may have benefitted from losing a studio. He could now concentrate on making films rather than overseeing laboratories and negotiating with trade unions. After the war (in which it’s claimed he worked for Churchill, not just making propaganda but hiring spies and doing reconnaissance under the guise of filming locations ) he somehow persuaded the Labour government to bankroll British Lion. And it’s in this period that he produced his greatest picture The Third Man, which could never really be called a spectacular or even an epic. As his nephew concludes in Charmed Lives “he had abandoned the “big international” picture to concentrate on films that were essentially British… He had learned – the hard way – that the British film industry could only succeed if it was firmly grounded in British subjects and British talent, and it would succeed abroad by quality, not by imitating Hollywood.” The man who tried to bring a bit of Hollywood to England was now making films every bit as parochial and small-scale as his peers. In 1954, British Lion produced The Belles Of St Trinians.\n\nSimilarly Denham made its most famous movie, Brief Encounter, almost a decade after Korda had left – in a roster that also included Henry V, The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp, A Matter Of Life And Death, and In Which We Serve. These box-office hits and future classics were not enough to save Denham, which was sacrificed to keep Pinewood going by its new owners The Rank Organisation, when they started to haemorrhage money. Shut down in 1951, Denham was the most high profile victim of Rank’s new managing director, John Davis, the Dr Beeching of the film industry, a serial closer of studios. More on him anon.\n\nThe star system, one of the rocks upon which modern cinema is founded, began life not in Hollywood, as is often assumed, but in the back garden of a suburban home owned by producer Cecil Hepworth.\n\nIn the very early years, film actors were familiar yet anonymous figures, uncredited and unmolested by paparazzi and gossip columnists. It wasn’t long, though, before studios were inundated with letters from adoring fans wanting to know everything about the beautiful strangers they only met in the dark. Early on, Hepworth must have intuitively grasped that the public shouldn’t see the joins between a star’s on and off-screen personas. A demure English rose couldn’t be a vamp and a lush in her private life, otherwise the spell would be broken. And to maintain that delicate illusion, Hepworth assigned his players not only new names but also new identities, giving them, in effect, another role to play. One of his stars, Chrissie White, for instance, had to appear as innocent as the characters she played in rural dramas like The Vicar Of Wakefield, so an inconvenient divorce was erased from history books, as was her real name – Ada Constance White. And where Hepworth led, D.W. Griffith followed. In 1910, he took an unknown Canadian actress called Gladys Marie Smith and made sure that the whole wide world knew her as Mary Pickford, America’s Sweeheart.\n\nIt’s only really by chance that Hepworth happened upon Walton-On-Thames. He started his film career with Charles Urban’s film processing company in Flicker Alley, the centre of the industry in Cecil Court, just off Charing Cross Road. When he was sacked from the company in 1899, he took his patented developing machine with him to set up business elsewhere. Initially he planned to base himself in Thames Ditton, where he’d spent an enjoyable summer holiday the year before. But when that proved unviable, he went upstream to Walton, where he found a villa for rent at £36 a year. It was here that he lived and worked – the two bedrooms were used as film drying rooms, leaving Hepworth nowhere to sleep. He admits in his autobiography Come The Dawn that he can’t remember where he slept. Perhaps he didn’t.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Hepworth decided to make his own films, rather than just develop others. A young girl called Mabel Clark was employed as editing assistant, though like everyone else in the studio, she multi-tasked, often starring in dozens of 50ft shorts (movies at the turn of the 20th century were bought by the foot). Using professional actors didn’t even enter the producer’s head, as “the mere idea of films was abhorred by all stage people and it is doubtful whether they would have come to Walton if we’d asked them”. Hepworth exploited the new medium’s USP, motion capture, with titles that left potential customers in no doubt that these pictures were moving: Donkey Race, Ladies Tortoise Race and Costume Race For Cyclists, filmed at a cycle gymkhana. From there it was just a short hop to covering major events, grander even than the local donkey derby. Hepworth’s first piece of new actuality was a shot of The City Imperial Volunteers as they boarded a ship bound for South Africa to join the conflict. Royal walkabouts were catnip to camera crews as they are now, such as the box-office hit Queen Victoria’s Visit To Dublin in 1900, although that didn’t prove nearly as popular as Queen Victoria’s funeral a year later.\n\nThe real break-through, though, was a trick film, Explosion Of A Motor-Car, in which car and occupants seem to go up in a puff of smoke without any obvious edits or special effects. Its classic formula of pyrotechnics, spectacle and optical illusion still wins at the box office today. Michael “Transfomers” Bay has effectively been making that movie for most of his career.\n\nOn the back of its phenomenal success, Hepworth decided to build a studio, in his back garden. The first structure resembled nothing less than a half-finished shed: a wooden floor perched on blocks just inches above the grass, with other planks of wood propped up against a shaky frame. These pieces of timber would act as the interiors, since filming was still carried out in broad daylight. In the spirit of British can-do amateurism, it was decided that Hepworth should paint the sets himself, even though he admitted: “I am no artist, but I remembered my childhood’s nursery efforts and so the job fell to me”. The producer claims in his autobiography that this was the first studio of its kind in the world. Even though the premises were gutted by a deadly fire in 1907, the complex soon took over the whole of Hurst Grove.\n\nAnd it’s here that many other innovations and inventions were forged, or at least claimed, such as the longest film ever made. This was in 1903 and the first ever adaptation of Alice In Wonderland, that spanned 800 feet, but could also be cut into handy 50 foot episodes, such as The Duchess And Her Pig Baby, which Hepworth ingeniously sold as separate items.\n\nTwo years later, he produced his blockbuster Rescued By Rover, in which a family’s dog turns detective when their baby is snatched from its pram by a beggar and taken across the water to Shepperton. Lewis Fitzhamon’s 6 minute nugget is credited as the first chase movie and first action film. Handing out garlands for being first is a dubious practice when it comes to silent movies, as only a tiny percentage of films survive. With a lack of material evidence, historians have to rely upon on witness testimony, self-aggrandising autobiographies by last men standing or Rachael Low’s jaundiced History Of The British Film. But so far as we know, Rescued By Rover was the first example of modern cinema. Whereas previous movies were showcases for stunts, jokes or special fx (even the long player Alice In Wonderland), Rover tells its story economically and in fragments. The film leaves it to the audience to infer what’s happened between scenes, to mentally join the dots. So, we see the collie scampering down a Walton street, then the film cuts to him diving into the Thames. We assume from the previous shot that he’s run all the way there, that he’s hasn’t suddenly vaulted through space and time. And importantly, there are no intertitles to guide us. What we’re witnessing is not so much the birth of a new language, as the first faltering attempts at a proper sentence.\n\nRescued By Rover was essentially a home movie. Hepworth’s daughter Barbara played the victim, his wife Margaret starred as the distraught mother and wrote the screenplay, while Hepworth himself made a cameo in a tall hat as the child’s father. And cinema’s first canine superstar was his pet, Blair. The dog’s adventures proved so popular with audiences that 400 prints were struck and even then the negatives wore out, so Fitzhamon had to direct two shot-for-shot remakes. Its follow-up The Dog Outwits The Kidnapper set the template for movie sequels by repeating the plot, stretching credulity (the same unlucky girl is stolen again, albeit by a rich man in a motor car) and upping the level of spectacle with a set-piece designed to slacken the jaws of its audience (Rover rescues the baby by expertly driving the child snatcher’s car back home).\n\nTaken and its ludicrous sequels, in which Liam Neeson plays the world’s unluckiest husband and father, are proof that cinema hasn’t really progressed that far in over a hundred years.\n\nHepworth’s other legacy, of course, is the star system, but that was borne out of failure. The producer originally tried to impose pseudonyms on his actors, stage"
