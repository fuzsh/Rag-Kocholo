(More below)\n\nHamlet on film (see Kliman’s 1988 book available at Hamlet Works / Texts / Criticism )\n\nmusical West Side Story\n\nAn example of an “embedded text”, one of Sanders's two broad categories of appropriations (when the relationship to the source text is not clearly signalled)\n\nWest Side Story would not exist without Romeo and Juliet (27) but it \"can and does stand alone as a musical in its own right, without need of the Romeo and Juliet connection, although I would still maintain that ... an intertextual awareness deepens and enriches the range of possible responses\" (28)\n\nKiss me Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)\n\nTheatre to graphic novel\n\nManga Shakespeare\n\nAnthony Del Col and Conor McCreery, Kill Shakespeare (2010-) [Canadian writers ] See Gerzic and Balfour's article\n\nNicki Greenberg's Hamlet (2010) [Australian writer]\n\nScreen to novel (showing to telling):\n\nStar Wars, The X-Files,\n\nOnce upon a Time in Hollywood (both film and novel by Q. Tarantino)\n\nGraphic novel to film\n\nV for Vendetta\n\nSin City\n\nGraphic novel to film to novel:\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\n\nTo videogames:\n\n“videogames cannot easily adapt what novels portray so well: the space of the mind (H 14)\n\nNovel to film to film to videogame to prequel novel:\n\nScareface , best known for Brian de Palma's 1983 film, -> videogame , -> prequel novel 2006, <- 1932 film dir. Howard Hawks (<- first ganster movie Underworld) <- Scareface novel by Armitage Trail in 1929 <- the rise and fall of Al Capone\n\nAnalysis\n\nFirst, a profile of the adaptation (hypertext) in its own terms: theme, genre, style, intention/purpose, tone and attitude, ideologies\n\nSecondly, a comparative analysis: Identification and explanation of adaptation shifts. Use of \"comparative narratology\" (Jost 2004, Stam 2005 \"Introduction\") and Bakhtinian, dialogic and ideological criticism.\n\nAdaptation shifts: mechanisms or operation by which adaptations (hypertexts) transform their hypotexts or source-texts\n\nFour Aristotelian categories applied to events, characters and linguistic text: what, how, and why.\n\n— omission, “cutting”\n\nsimplification, selection,\n\ncondensation, contraction, compression ( from long novels to plays or films)\n\nomission of important words, phrases (thematic words, adjective and adverbs that express attitude), passages\n\n— addition, amplification\n\nexpansion (from short story to film)\n\naddition of sensitive words and phrases (thematic words, adjectives and adverbs that express attitude), of passages\n\nE.g. García Suelto, translator-adaptor of Ducis’s version of Macbeth [and of Romeo and Juliet], adds the term “regicida” in his Macbé o los remordimientos (published in 1818 during Ferdinand VII’s restoration of absolutism), a term that in France alluded to the those who ordered the execution of Luis XVI in 1793 and that Ducis did not use: -> García Suelto was a classicist and supporter of the Ancient Régime (Pujante and Gregor 201, p. 29; Pujante 2019, p. 169).\n\n— substitution\n\nalteration of events, of characters, Relocation of story in different time and geography, different culture\n\nalteration of words and phrases (thematic words, adjective and adverbs that express attitude)\n\n— transposition\n\nchanges in the structure\n\nNarratological analysis of time (Genette, Rimmon-Kennan): order (analepses or flashbacks, prolepses), duration (pace, ellipsis, descriptive pause, scene, summary), frequency\n\n\"What is the drift of these changes? What principles orient the choices?\" Do they push the adaptation \"to the 'right', by naturalizing and justifying social hierarchies based on class, race, sexuality, gender, region, and national belonging, or to the ¡left¡ by interrogating or leveling hierarchies in an egalitarian manner\" (Stam 2005 \"Introduction\" p. 34, 42)\n\nContextual (historical) analysis:\n\nTime difference between production of hypertext (source) and adaptation (hypotext) (Stam \"Introduction\")\n\nCensorship\n\nIdeological shifts\n\nAesthetic mainstreaming\n\nSpecifics of the analysis of adaptation from the narrative (telling) to the audiovisual (showing):\n\nNarrator: \"The film as a 'narrator' [is] the abstract instance or superordinate agency that regulates the spectator's knowledge\" (Stam \"Introduction\" p. 35)\n\nFrom verbal narrator to non-narration (showing) in theatre\n\nDramatization: David Lodge “Adapting Nice Work for television”\n\nFrom verbal narrator to mediator-narrator in film\n\n…\n\nResults of these textual operations:\n\nIdeas are made “actual”, “concrete”, “natural” to a target audience; or “changed”\n\n“Indiginization” (= “domestication” in translation)\n\nAmbiguities may be clarified, spelled out, or added\n\nIdeology (“worldview”) underlying the “source” text may be altered\n\nThackeray's Vanity Fair : satire of social pretense > American TV and film versions : the triumph of the individual (H 30)\n\nPoint of view (immediacy of internal narrator (so-called \"1st-person\" narrator)\n\ninterior monologue\n\nTone: irony\n\nFilm adaptation of literary texts\n\nDistinguishing the specificity of the media (novel and film)\n\nTwo contrasting views:\n\n“Generally film is found to work from perception toward signification, from external facts to interior motivations and consequences , from the givenness of a world to the meaning of a story cut out of that world. Literary fiction works oppositely. It begins with signs (graphemes and words) building to propositions which attempt to develop perception. As a product of human language it naturally treats human motivation and values, seeking to throw them out onto the external world, elaborating a world out of a story.” (Andrew 101)\n\nSecond misconception: “film makes fewer demands on the imagination than a book does” (in reading we translated words into conceptual images)\n\n“It maybe just as persuasively argued that in coming to serioss terms with a film much more is being required of us” … film requires “that we pay attention to the intricate interaction of\n\nmise-en-scène (what is visibly in the frame at any given moment),\n\nthe editing (how one shot of a film is joined-to/separated-from the next)\n\nand sound (diegetic or non-diegetic, musical or otherwise) (McFarlane “Reading film p. 16)\n\nSpecificity of film medium\n\nFeatures of the film medium: cinematic techniques (Bordwell & Thompson)\n\nShot : 1) mise-en-scène\n\n2) cinematography : photography\n\nframing\n\nShot: mise-en-scène\n\nthe director's control of what happens in the film frame (B&T 156)\n\nwhat is filmed\n\n(shot = one uninterrupted run of the camera to expose a series of frames, also called a take B&T 433\n\nAspects: setting, lighting, costume and make-up, movement and acting (as in theatre)\n\nShot: cinematography\n\nhow it is filmed\n\ncinematography = “writing in movement”, depends on photography “writing in light” B&T 193)\n\nThree factors : 1) photographic aspects of the shot\n\n2) framing of the shot\n\n3) duration of the shot\n\n1.

Spatial relations between shot A and shot B\n\ne.g. 'establishing shot' followed by a shot of a part of this space\n\ne.g crosscutting (or parallel editing)\n\n4. Temporal relations between shot A and shot B\n\norder : flashback, flashforward,\n\nduration : ellipsis (elliptical editing), overlapping editing (for temporal expansion)\n\nfrequency :\n\nContinuity editing (= “a system of cutting to maitain continuous and clear narrative action”. It relies on “matching screen direction, position and temporal relations from shot to shot” B&T 429)\n\nTechniques : axis of action, crosscutting, cut-in, establishing shot, eyeline match, match on action, reestablishing shot, screen directions, shot/reverse shot\n\nAlternatives to continuity editing\n\nSound\n\nFundamentals of film sound:\n\nPerceptual properties: loudness, pitch, timbre\n\nSelection, alteration and combination\n\nDimension of film sound:\n\nRhythm : coordination or disparity in sound and image\n\nFidelity :\n\nSpace : diegetic vs nondiegetic sound\n\nresources of diegetic sound: external diegetic sound ; internal diegetic sound ( that which comes from 'inside' the mind of a character\n\nTime : matching sound and image in synchronous sound ; asynchronous (or out-of-synch)\n\nTemporal and spation relations that image and sound can display:\n\nFeatures and Techniques (film adaptation)–\n\nThe story can be the same if the narrative units (characters, events, motivations, consequences, context, viewpoint, imagery, and so on) are produced equally in two works. …. The analysis of adaptation them must point to the achievement of equivalent narrative units in the … different semiotic systems of film and language (Andrew 103)\n\nIt's interesting to read “manuals” for screenwriters: McKee, Seger\n\n§ Focalization or point of view:\n\n-> camera angle, focal length, music, mis-en-scène, performance, costume : they all can convey point of view in film (Stam and Raengo 39)\n\n§ Intimacy of narrator-character (homodiegetic narrator, or first-person narrator)\n\n-> voice-over : too obvious; it makes spectators focus on words rather than on the action being shown\n\nVoice-over is successful in creating (Eddie) the moral centre for the whole story in Eastwood's 2004 Million Dollar Baby based on various stories Rope Burns\n\n-> 'subjective shot' (B&T) position of camera on the level of the character, as in Robert Montgomery's 1946 film based on R. Chandler's 1943 Lady in the Lake : film uses mirrors to show the narrator-character [video] : this is unsual, often perceived as clumsy, artificial (H 54)\n\n-> having a character narrate the beginning and end of a story,\n\n-> camera represents point of view of different characters (camera as a moving third-person narrator), e.g. Kurosawa's 1950 period drama Rashomon providing four characters' version of the same incident (H 54)\n\n->\n\n§ Character's inner world: their minds and feelings\n\n[soliloquies in a play: \"voice-over\", as in \"To be, or not to be\" in Olivier's 1948 Hamlet\n\n“voice-over” : too obvious; it makes spectators focus on words rather than on the action being shown\n\nstream of consciousness in Joyce's Ulysses\n\nfinal chapter: Molly Bloom's interior monoogue-> Strick's 1967 film 26-minute episode of actress' voice-over , images sometimes visualize what she's saying, sometimes recap incidents of the action in the novel [1:33:00]\n\nchapter 1 “Ineluctable modality of the visible […] Touch me” (4800 words) -> voice-over in Joseph Strick's 1967 film with montage of various shots [17:25 – 21.38 ], uses screens of total blackness to match Stephen's closing of his eyes\n\nStrick does not use Holywood's conventions to represent subjectivity (shot/reverse shot, eye-line match) (H 57)\n\n-> visual and aural correlatives for interior events\n\n-> “close-up” to explore “the microdrama of human countenance” (Bluestone 1957 , 1971 p. 27), to create psychological intimacy (H 59)\n\nVisconti's Death in Venice : a close-up of protagonist Aschenbach after he's been to the barber's, showing the tension between his anguish and his desire in a “brutally tight close-up” (H 58) [1:48:00, or perhaps 1:53\n\nUlysses chapter 1 “The aunt thinks you killed your mother”, paragraph with Stephen's thoughts “Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite” … shavingbowl\n\n-> combination of close-up and other techniques = Strick's 1967 Ulysses at 2:10-2:36 flashback sequence of shots showing what Stephen remembers about the death of his mother, followed by close-up of Stephen, then another sequence shows Stephen's overturning of shaving bowl at 4:25 to close the episode\n\n-> music may invoke a “dimension of depth of interiority” (Karmer 1991 p. 156, in H 60)\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man -> Strick's 1978 film “uses sequential flashbacks and flashforwards to give a sense of Stephen's fractured subjectivity” (H 57) , “sound and avant-garde film devices can work to signal interiority” (H 58)\n\nHowards End : characters' reaction to Beethoven's Fifth symphony (chapter 5)\n\nthe experience unsettles Helen, “panic and emptiness” passage\n\nThe narrator sums up the experience: “The music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career. She read it as a tangible statement, which could never be superseded”\n\n-> James Ivory'2 1992 film : (at 0:11:20 approx.) we can only guess at Helen's thoughts ( H 24-5). The “panic and emptiness” of the goblins is not experienced by her; it is the lecturer who uses this as an image in his explanation of the piece in response to a question. Helen seems more bored than upset by the whole experience (H 25)\n\n§shifts to the past or to the futre : “literature's “meanwhile”, “elsewhere” and “later” find their equivalent in the filmic disolve, as one image fades in as another fades out” (H 63)\n\n-> past can also be represented through décor and costumes, props, music, titles (e.g. London 1712), color (sepia tints), archiac recording devices, and artificially aged or real past footage (Stam and Raengo 21)\n\n§ Ambiguity :\n\nTurn of the Screw by Henry James 1898 : is the governness hallucinating the existence of the deceased former employees or are the children possessed by something supernatural?\n\n-> Jack Clayton 1961 adaptation The Innocents (screenplay by Turman Capote and W. Archibald) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbrFFLQcEjg\n\n[Beginning:\n\nopening in darkness, voice of little boy singing, music, birds, extreme close-up of hands clasping, slowly revealing face of Mrs Giddens showing inner torture -> \"the opening scene creates a sense of intimacy and, perhaps, trust that the governess should be trusted, but the use of darkness surrounding her suggests that it is possible that the story that follows could be nothing more than in her own mind – isolated and creating its own supernatural world\" (Frayling, Christopher (2014). The Innocents (Blu-ray) ]\n\nthe camera alternate points of view ;\n\nthe soundtrack is used to suggest interiority and, with the use of eerie sounds, suggest either supernatural presences or what is going on in the governess's mind\n\nmismatches between what we hear and what we see\n\n[Photos from Wikipedia 20200227:\n\nMiles and Flore caption:\n\n\"A key point of dispute between Clayton and screenwriter W.

Between Horror, Fear, and Beauty (Blu-ray documentary).\n\n]\n\nBut in the end James' narrative ambiguity is refused on the naturalistic medium of film (H 69)\n\n§ Metaphors, symbols\n\n-> spoken by a character\n\n-> physically materialized in iconic form\n\n-> translated into equivalents\n\n-> editing may suggest metaphoric comparison by linking disparate images together (H 71)\n\n§ Verbal irony\n\nBarry Lyndon by W. Thackeray (1844 the Luck of Barry Lyndon), first-person narrator, parody of contemporary fashion for criminal-hero (Bloomsbury Guide)\n\n-> Stanley Kubrick's 1975 Barry Lindon uses ironic voice-over narrator between scenes ; Barry Lyndon is much more sympathetic that that of Thackeray's (H 71)\n\n§ Associative language in Mrs Dalloway -> Marleen Gross's 1998 film uses “associative visual imagery” (H )\n\n§ Absences or silences:\n\nMelville's Billy Budd :\n\nContext : sailor Billy kills malicious captain at arms John Claggart; the killing could have been seen as an accident, but the only witness, Captain Vere, chooses not to save Billy but rather “to give into his professional fears that this act could be seen as the first step to a possible mutiny” (H 72)\n\nAbsent event = Captain Vere informs sailor Billy of the court's decision to have him hanged: The omniscient narrator says “Beyond the communication of the sentence what took place at this interview was never known”. The narrator essays “some conjectures”\n\n-> Ustinov's film dramatizes the scene with melodramatic music as Vere asks Billy to hate him as a way of conquering his fear, and Billy replies that he is not afraid: “I was only doing my duty. You are doing yours” (quoted in H 74)\n\n§ absence of description for a character: as the lawyer Mr Jaggers in Dickens' Great Expectations : in a film the character must be described (shown) “to visualize the character … destroys the very subtlety with which the novel creates this particular character (Giddings, Selby and Wensely p. 81)\n\nFilm adaptation in context\n\nIntentions of the adaption:\n\n– critique, call into question the “source” text (questioning the latter's aesthetic or political values)\n\n– show respect, pay tribute to to the “source” work\n\n– erase the memory of the adapted text (H 7)\n\nAdaptations [like translations ] may reveal about the context of production and reception\n\nDr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, novella by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\n1920 film dir.

In the title role, Audie Murphy played not Greene's dangerously ambiguous figure - whose belief in the justice of American foreign policy allows him to ignore the appalling consequences of his actions - but a simple hero.

adaptation that comment on the politics of the source, usually by means of alteration or addition (Sanders 2006, 21)\n\nDerek Jarman's 1979 film The Tempest (adds the Algerian witch Sycorax)\n\nPatricia Rozema's 2000 film Mansfield Park makes explicit the novel's context in the history of British colonialism and the practice of slavery on Antiguan plantations (Sanders 2006: 22)\n\nThe full impact of this kind of adaptation depends upon the audience's awareness of an explicit relationship to a source text (Sanders 2006: 22)\n\n3. analogy: takes ‘a fiction as a point of departure’ (1975: 223) and therefore ‘cannot be indicted as a violation of a literary original since the director has not attempted (or has only minimally attempted) to reproduce the original’ (Wagner 1975: 227).\n\nWagner seems unable to determine whether Luis BunÌuel’s Belle de jour (1967) is a commentary or an analogy (Aragay 16)\n\nanalogue : stand-alone works Francis Ford Coppola film Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nMichel Winterbottom's Hollywood Western The Claim (2001) is a re-vision of Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge\n\nJerome Robbins's and Robert Wise's musical West Side Story : a reworking of Romeo and Juliet in the context of the race conflicts New York in 1950s, particularly \"resentment of and violence towards the immigrant Puerto Rican community\" (Sanders 2006:27)\n\nMusical My Fair Lady : George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion\n\nAragay (2005:16) \"Wagner is obsessively concerned with ‘defending’ adaptations of any sort from the charge of ‘infidelity’, while his attempts at actually applying his tripartite classification to specific adaptations have the perverse effect of foregrounding the severely limited theoretical and practical validity of any model that relies on the centrality of the literary source or ‘original’\".\n\nAndrew (98): Borrowing – Intersection – Fidelity of transformation\n\nBorrowing\n\nThe artist employs, more or less extensively, the material, idea, or form of an earlier, generally successful text . E.g medieval miracle plays based on biblical stories. E.g. adaptations of Shakespeare plays\n\nThe adaptation hopes to win an audience by the prestige of its borrowed title or subject. But at the same time it seeks to gain a certain respectability\n\nAnalyst needs to probe the source of power in the original by examining the use made of it in adaptation. Here the main concern is the generality of the original, its potential for wide and varied appeal.\n\nThis is true of adapted material which claims the status of myth e.g. Tristan and Isolde, possibly Midsummer Night’s Dream.\n\nThe success of adaptations of this sort rests on the issue of their fertility not their fidelity (Andrew 99).\n\nIntersecting\n\nThe uniqueness of the original is left unassimilated in adaptation (Andrew 99).\n\n“cinema records its confrontation with an ultimately intransigent text”\n\nE.g.

The aural has to be made visual. The poetic texture has itself to be transformed into a visual poetry, into the dynamic organisation of film imagery\" (Kozintsev's essay \"Hamlet and King Lear: Stage and Film\", 1972, p. 191)\n\navoidance of the literal image visualization what the character speaks: a film showing a cherub riding a horse because Macbeth uses the metaphor of \"pity, like a new-bon babe / Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, horsed / Upon the sightless couriers of the air\" (1.7.21-23),\n\ntranslation of \"the essential meanings and moods of the text ... into a text of cinema\" (Hindle Studying, p. 78). This is difficult because film has culturally acquired associations with realism and naturalism (\"for understandable commercial reasons\", as Hindle remarks)\n\nto \"make visible\" the poetic atmosphere of the play \"investing what is photographed with metaphoric, rather than realistic value, this multiplying meanings and effects\" (Hindle Studying, p. 79).\n\nNon- or anti-realist film techniques:\n\nIn Welles's Othello, \"skewed camera angles, deep focus, dissolves, powerfully graphic compositions, long tracking shots, surrealistic reflections – all serve to pictorialise the unstable and claustrophobic world of destructive emotions and behaviours set in motion by devilish Iago\" (Hindle Studying, 79)\n\nOpening scene: Compare first scene in play-text or beginning of Burge's 1965 Othello (video), with first 4 minutes video ; Bumdog Torres' composition analysis in video. Hindle: shot of Iago trapped in a cage initiates \"an image system of iron bars or barred verticals that, together with repeated images of stony vaults or high walls, conveys with emphatic visual power the forces of entrapment that relentessly develop in the play text\" (p.79)\n\n§ periodising mode: transporting the story and characters \"wholesale into the cultural trappings and social dynamic of distinctly recongisable historical period\" (Hindle Studying, p. 82-87)\n\nExamples: Christine Edzard's 1992 As You Like It ; Richard Loncraine's 1994 Richard III ; Baz Luhrmann's 1996 Romeo + Juliet.\n\nThe beginning of Pride and Prejudice in screen adaptations\n\nRobert Z.

A single man of large fortune; four\n\nor five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\n\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\n\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\n\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\n\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\n\nparty.\"\n\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\n\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\n\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\n\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\n\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\n\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\n\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\n\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\n\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\n\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\n\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\n\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\n\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\n\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\n\npreference.\"\n\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\n\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\n\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\n\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\n\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\n\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\n\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\n\nvisit them.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\n\nall.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\n\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\n\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\n\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\n\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\n\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\n\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\n\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\n\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\n\npaid, she had no knowledge of it.\n\nHowards End, by E. M. Forster (1910)\n\n``[T]he Andante had begun - very beautiful, but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes that Beethoven has written, and, to Helen's mind, rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third. She heard the tune through once, and then her attention wandered [...] and the Andante came to an end... Helen said to her aunt : `Now comes the wonderful movement : first of all the goblins, and then a trio of elephants dancing,' and Tibby implored the company generally to look out for the the transitional passage on the drum...\n\n`No ; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back,' breathed Helen, as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others followed him. They were not aggressive creatures ; it was that that made them so terrible to Helen. They merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world. After the interlude of elephants dancing, they returned and made the observation for the second time. Helen could not contradict them, for, once at all events, she had felt the same, and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse. Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! The goblins were right.\n\nHer brother raised his finger : it was the transitional passage on the drum.\n\nFor, as if things were going too far, Beethoven took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted. He appeared in person. He gave them a little push, and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a minor, and then he blew with his mouth and they were scattered ! Gusts of splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle, magnificent death ! [...] Any fate was titanic ; any contest desirable ; conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars.\n\nAnd the goblins - they had not really been there at all ? They were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief ? One healthy human impulse would dispel them. Men like the Wilcoxes, or President Roosevelt, would say yes. Beethoven knew better. The goblins really had been there. They might return - and they did. It was as if the splendour of life might boil over and waste to steam and froth. In its dissolution one heard the terrible, ominous note, and a goblin, with increased malignity, walked quietly over the universe from end to end. Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall.\n\nBeethoven chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up. He blew with his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were scattered. He brought back the gusts of splendour, the heroism, the youth, the magnificence of life and death, and, amid vast roarings of a superhuman joy, he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion. But the goblins were there. They could return. He had said so bravely, and that is why one can trust Beethoven when he says other things.\n\nHelen pushed her way out during the applause... The music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career. She read it as a tangible statement, which could never be superseded. The notes meant this and that to her, and they could have no other meaning, and life could have no other meaning (chap. V ; 1989 p. 45-47 ).'\n\nReferences\n\nJournals on adaptation\n\nLiterature/Film Quarterly\n\nAdaptation (adaptation.uk.com)\n\nThe Journal of Adaptation in Film and Performance\n\nBorrowers and Lenders: The Journal of Shakespeare and Appropriation\n\nComparative Literature\n\nComparative Drama\n\nOnline resources:\n\nAdaptation Studies\n\nCanadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project\n\nBBC 60-second Shakespeare\n\nBibliography\n\nAdam Mateu, Carlona y Mercedes Azcárraga Pascual.
