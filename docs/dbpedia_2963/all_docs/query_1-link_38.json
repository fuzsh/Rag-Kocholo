Alex’s job was to shoot and edit B&H Video Podcast about new products. This is where Alex obtained knowledge and experience in using and understanding professional photographic and cinematographic equipment. Pushkin Studio, is therefore, very technical when it comes to our gear. Using a camera in automatic mode doesn’t produce attractive footage. We shoot in full manual mode, utilize professional lighting & sound for video, and use Full Frame 1080p cameras with interchangeable, highest grade optics. Each photographer and cinematographer working for Pushkin Studio is hand picked by Alex on the basis of passion for capturing an amazing shot, creativity, technical skills, and professionalism."
