        "text": "It is very difficult to open “the artist formerly known as Twitter “(now X) without South Korean Olympic athlete Kim Yeji popping up. Everything arises from a video in which you can see the shooter breaking the world record in her category, and also doing so with an impeccable pose and style, looking at the camera with a dispassionate gesture, like someone who breaks world records for breakfast and it’s too cool to even care about your day.\n\nHer particular shooting glasses also contributed, which for those who are not familiar with them seem directly taken from a cyberpunk world and delve into the general style of the figure. The video quickly went viral among film, anime, and video game fans, who were excited by the new idol, also thinking that it was in the current Olympics, although that was not exactly the case.\n\nAs often happens on social networks, the video is not contextualized. In fact, you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to see the giant “Azerbaijan” sign behind her. The video belongs to the last world championships in Baku where, yes, Kim Yeji broke the Air Pistol shooting world record and was the winner in the 25-meter category. However, it is her compatriot, Oh Ye Jin, 19, who has won the gold medal in the Paris Olympics in the 10-meter category (Kim Yeji has won silver). In the photo, you can see both, with Kim Ye-Ji carrying her daughter’s elephant and Oh Ye Jin with a heart-shaped gun sight. Furthermore, to break the mystique a little, the dispassionate attitude of the shooter in the video is not because she has ice in his veins, but because this is considered an “elegant sport” and there are certain rules of behavior before, during, and after each shot taken that must be respected, under risk of penalty.\n\nAlthough the reality is different from the figure of a ruthless killer, the truth is that her image at the world championships is already firmly positioned in the collective imagination and she’s not going to get out of there for a long time. Even Hideo Kojima himself has posted it on his networks, in what was an easy prediction given the aesthetic tastes of the Japanese director. She certainly fits the character of a Kojima Productions game, so let’s not rule out the required photo in the future.\n\nBy the way, for those who want to enjoy their new obsession, the South Korean shooter has a new date with the Olympics on August 1, 2, and 3, where she will be able to defend her world championship in the 25-meter category with the final set for August 3."
