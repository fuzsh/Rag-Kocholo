Kline © Copyright 2009 All Rights Reserved\n\nThis work may be freely reproduced, stored and transmitted, electronically or otherwise, for any non-commercial purpose. Conditions and Exceptions apply.\n\nChapter Six\n\nLà sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi\n\nNasce una gente a cui l’morir none dole.\n\nPetrarch\n\nThere, where days are cloudy and brief,\n\nAre born a people to whom death brings no pain.\n\n1.\n\nEugene, now Vladimir had left,\n\nWas bored again beyond all measure,\n\nBy Olga, though yet not bereft\n\nEntirely of his vengeful pleasure;\n\nOlga too yawns by him, sadly\n\nGlancing round to seek her Lensky,\n\nTired of this cotillion;\n\nThis nightmare whirling, on and on.\n\nAt last it’s over, now it’s supper,\n\nThen rooms are found for every guest,\n\nAll glad at heart to take their rest,\n\nFrom the ground floor to the upper,\n\nIn attic too. Eugene, instead,\n\nDrives home, preferring his own bed.\n\n2.\n\nAll’s peaceful; in the parlour, vying\n\nSnore for snore, fat Pustyakov,\n\nBy his better half is lying.\n\nGvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,\n\nAnd Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,\n\nIn the dining room downstairs;\n\nTriquet’s slumbering on the floor,\n\nIn shirt and night-cap, by the door;\n\nThe girls are stowed with Tatyana,\n\nAnd with Olga, lost in dream;\n\nBut, lighted by Diana’s gleam,\n\nAlone and sad, my darling Tanya,\n\nSleepless, at the window, stares\n\nAt dark fields, mirroring her cares.\n\n3.\n\nOnegin’s unexpected presence;\n\nHis fleeting glance of tenderness;\n\nHis partnering Olga too, what sense\n\nTo make of that; her own distress;\n\nAll pierced her to the core; and then\n\nHer failure too to comprehend;\n\nAnd jealousy, you understand,\n\nAs if a cold, an icy hand\n\nHad gripped her heart, as if a black\n\nAnd seething abyss at her feet\n\nHad opened… ‘Yet the death is sweet\n\nHe brings’ – she murmurs – ‘and I lack\n\nStrength to complain, I confess,\n\nThough he can’t bring me happiness.’\n\n4.\n\nBut on, on with my story!\n\nA new face claims our attention.\n\nFive versts from Krasnogorye,\n\nLensky’s estate, worth a mention,\n\nThere lives, and thrives no less,\n\nIn the intellectual wilderness,\n\nZaretsky, once a reprobate,\n\nGambler-in-chief, an intimate\n\nAnd sage of inns, a philanderer;\n\nKind and sober, now, instead,\n\nFather of many, still unwed;\n\nHe, as friend in need, you’ll gather,\n\nEven as man of honour, features:\n\nSo our age improves us creatures!\n\n5.\n\nThere was a time when envious faces\n\nPraised his sheer daring; he could hit\n\nAn ace of clubs at twenty paces,\n\nAnd pierce the very heart of it.\n\nCarried away by his brave calling,\n\nHe made his name by simply falling:\n\nWhen far ahead of his battalion,\n\nHe toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,\n\nDrunk as an owl, a Frenchman’s prize,\n\nYet a modern Regulus, the soul\n\nOf honour: ready – it was his goal –\n\nFor capture again, should that arise,\n\nAs long as, on credit, they’d guarantee,\n\nThree bottles a day, for him, chez Véry.\n\n6.\n\nHe was the practical joker, ever\n\nProne to lead a fool about,\n\nBy the nose; deceive the clever;\n\nIn secret, or with raucous shout;\n\nThough he’d occasionally misfire\n\nAnd end, himself, in the mire,\n\nAs much the victim of his fun,\n\nAs any passing simpleton.\n\nHe liked debate, to point a moral,\n\nMake a blunt or sharp retort,\n\nAt times be silent, then in sport\n\nCunningly begin a quarrel,\n\nIncite two friends of his to fight,\n\nA duel in the morning light,\n\n7.\n\nOr force them to be reconciled,\n\nAnd earn a luncheon with them both;\n\nThough privately they’d be reviled,\n\nWith cruel joke, or lying oath!\n\nSed alia tempora! With the rest,\n\n(Like love’s young dream, another jest)\n\nSuch things belong to youth, now dead.\n\nFor my Zaretsky, as I said,\n\nFound refuge from the storm of life,\n\nBeneath his cherries and acacias,\n\nLike Horace, peaceful and sagacious,\n\nPlants cabbages, and free from strife,\n\nBreeds ducks and geese, while at his knee\n\nThe children learn their ABC.\n\n8.\n\nHe was no fool; appreciated\n\nBy Yevgeny not for his heart\n\nBut for his wit, which he rated,\n\nFinding him sensible, yet smart.\n\nIn the past quite frequently\n\nHe’d called, was pleasant company;\n\nSo morning brought no great surprise\n\nWhen Zaretsky met his eyes.\n\nYet, after brief greeting, to begin\n\nThe visit, a note he proffered,\n\nPenned by Lensky, and as he offered\n\nThe missive gave a caustic grin:\n\nOnegin, without more ado,\n\nAt the window, read it through.\n\n9.\n\nPolitely, without indecision,\n\nIn as brief a cartel as was right,\n\nLensky, coolly, with precision,\n\nHad merely challenged him to fight.\n\nOnegin without hesitating,\n\nTurned to the envoy, mutely waiting,\n\nAnd spoke as if he scarcely cared,\n\nWhat might result: ‘Ever prepared.’\n\nAt this Zaretsky promptly rose,\n\nNot needing to prolong his stay,\n\nNow anxious to be on his way,\n\nAnd brought the visit to a close;\n\nYet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,\n\nUnhappy with the role he’d played.\n\n10.\n\nAnd rightly so: For sitting sternly\n\nIn private judgement on his action,\n\nHe condemned himself severely:\n\nFirst: he’d erred in his reaction\n\nTo a love both shy and tender,\n\nMocked what true hearts engender;\n\nSecond: the poet might be a fool,\n\nBut then at eighteen that’s the rule;\n\nWhile, holding him in such affection,\n\nYevgeny should have shown control,\n\nAnd played a wholly different role,\n\nNot, blown in every direction,\n\nGo seeking quarrels, take offence,\n\nNot as a man of honour, sense.\n\n11.\n\nHe might have spoken openly,\n\nInstead of bristling from the start,\n\nEndeared himself more readily\n\nTo Lensky’s young, receptive heart.\n\n‘But now, too late: the moment’s past…\n\nBesides’ ­– he thought – ‘the die is cast,\n\nSince that old duellist is vicious,\n\nA trouble-maker, and malicious;\n\nTrue, contempt should rightly answer\n\nAll spiteful gossip, yet his tools\n\nWill slyly whisper, grinning fools…’\n\nAnd then such things are like a cancer!\n\nFor it’s our idol, honour’s mainspring,\n\nOpinion, keeps the whole world turning!\n\n12.\n\nAt home, impatient, breathing fire,\n\nThe poet awaits Eugene’s reply:\n\nHere comes Zaretsky, colour higher,\n\nWith solemn look, and sparkling eye.\n\nNow jealousy shows its delight!\n\nHe’d feared lest his opponent might\n\nBy slight of hand, or by some jest,\n\nMake an escape, shield his breast\n\nFrom the avenging bullet; now,\n\nDoubt is over, they will fight,\n\nBeside the mill, and at first light,\n\nAs soon as daybreak will allow,\n\nCock their pistols, and let fly,\n\nTo hit the head, or break a thigh.\n\n13.\n\nResolved to hate the false, the fickle,\n\nLensky, blazing with resentment,\n\nKeen to avoid her, before the duel,\n\nChecked the sun, his watch – and went!\n\nAbandoning all true discretion,\n\nHe rode in his lover’s direction;\n\nOlga he thought would be dismayed;\n\nAt the unexpected move he’d made,\n\nBut no! – Down the steps, as ever,\n\nSwiftly, she flew to meet him,\n\nLight as air, ran to greet him,\n\nBuoyant as hope, that soars forever;\n\nIn the same lively, carefree way\n\nAs she might on any other day.\n\n14.\n\n‘Why did you leave so early,’ Olga\n\nAsks him, ‘yesterday? Disturbed,\n\nSilent, he bows his head before her,\n\nIn confusion, thoughts perturbed.\n\nJealousy gone, and anger’s blaze,\n\nFaced with her open, tender gaze,\n\nFaced with her sweet simplicity,\n\nFaced with her soul’s bright clarity! …\n\nHe sees, his heart filled with emotion,\n\nAt once he’s tortured by remorse,\n\nSees he is loved, feels the force\n\nOf pure regret, his only notion\n\nTo be forgiven; trembles; mute;\n\nHis happiness rare, and absolute.\n\n15-17.\n\nNow full of grief he lacks the strength\n\nTo speak about the night before,\n\nOr to examine her at length,\n\nBut broods on what he must ignore:\n\n‘Yet’, he reflects, ‘I must save her’,\n\nNot allow that coarse seducer,\n\nWith sighs or flattery, to aspire\n\nTo tempt her with his base desire.\n\nThe vile and venomous worm\n\nShall not attack the lily flower,\n\nThe bud of life’s fairest hour,\n\nShall not fade before its term.’\n\nWhich translates as: he intends\n\nTo see Onegin dead, my friends.\n\n18.\n\nIf he had known what agony\n\nBurned in my dear Tanya’s heart!\n\nHad Tanya had the power to see\n\nThe future by some magic art,\n\nAware that Lensky and Eugene,\n\nWould meet in the morning, keen\n\nTo dispute the entrance to the grave –\n\nLove might have found a way to save\n\nThem both, but no one knew her mind,\n\nNo one had divined her passion,\n\nOnegin was silent, in his fashion,\n\nAnd Tanya alone, in secret, pined;\n\nPerhaps her nurse, if she’d been blessed,\n\nWith quicker wits, might have guessed.\n\n19.\n\nAll evening Lensky was distracted,\n\nNow cheerful, now full of gloom;\n\nAs servants of the Muse have acted,\n\nSince time began; so, he’d resume\n\nHis seat at the clavichord,\n\nThen play a note or two before,\n\nTurning his troubled gaze on Olga\n\n‘I’m happy, am I not?’ he’d whisper.\n\nIt’s late; and time for him to take\n\nHis leave, his heart crushed, once more,\n\nHe turns to go, and at the door,\n\nIt seems to him that it must break,\n\nShe gazes earnestly: ‘What’s wrong?’\n\n‘Nothing,’ he answers, and is gone.\n\n20.\n\nAt home, his pistols are inspected\n\nThen replaced, their case shut tight;\n\nHe undresses; a book’s selected,\n\nSchiller, to scan by candlelight.\n\nHis sad heart prevents all rest,\n\nBy a single thought oppressed:\n\nHe seems to see his Olga, bright\n\nIn all her beauty, in the night.\n\nVladimir shuts the book once more,\n\nThen poetry flows from his pen,\n\nFull of love’s foolishness, again\n\nVerse sounds, as he strides the floor,\n\nLike that by Delvig’s muse created,\n\nAt dinner, when intoxicated.\n\n21.\n\nBy chance, I have the lines, unfinished,\n\nThey’re here before me, his in truth:\n\n‘Where, oh where have you vanished,\n\nGolden springtime of my youth?\n\nThis day to come, what will it bring?\n\nMy eyes in vain seek out the thing\n\nThat’s veiled in deepest mystery.\n\nNo matter: a just fate awaits me.\n\nWhether I fall struck by the power\n\nOf its arrow, or death wings by,\n\nAll is well: our moments fly,\n\nSleep and waking have their hour,\n\nBlessed the day of toil and care,\n\nBlessed the tomb’s darkness there.’\n\n22.\n\n‘The morning star will tremble bright,\n\nThen the shining day will dawn,\n\nAnd I – perhaps, far from the light,\n\nWill know the secrets of death’s bourn;\n\nLethe will drown all memory\n\nOf the poet, this world forget me,\n\nBut you, the beautiful, and dear,\n\nWill you not stop to shed a tear\n\nOver my urn, and think: “He loved,\n\nAnd in the fierce storm and strife,\n\nAll the sad morning of his life,\n\nBy me alone his soul was moved!”…?\n\nFriend of my heart, eternal friend,\n\nCome to me, come: yours, to the end!...’\n\n23.\n\nHis vein then was dark and languid,\n\n(The Romantic style, or so they say,\n\nThough I fail to see what’s romantic\n\nIn it: no matter, that’s by the way).\n\nAt last near dawn, his weary head\n\nNodding, he laid it down instead\n\nOn the page, on the word ideal,\n\nOne with a fashionable feel.\n\nHe slept at last, but fitfully,\n\nYet sleep had barely laid its claim\n\nOn him, when he heard his name,\n\nCalled by his neighbour, forcefully.\n\n‘Up now, and no procrastinating:\n\nPast six, Onegin will be waiting.’\n\n24.\n\nBut he’s in error; our Yevgeny\n\nIs sleeping soundly: in the yard,\n\nThe night’s shadows thinning swiftly,\n\nThe cock-crow hails the morning star;\n\nOnegin slumbers on regardless.\n\nThe sun now dispels the darkness,\n\nA brief snow-flurry spirals by,\n\nEugene continues to lie\n\nIn blissful sleep, it’s certain,\n\nThe winged god hovers overhead.\n\nAt last he stirs, sits up in bed\n\nAnd pulls aside the curtain;\n\nLooks out, noting it is day,\n\nAnd high time to be on his way.\n\n25.\n\nHastily he rings; the servant,\n\nGuillot, his French valet, appears;\n\nSlippers, dressing-gown: this instant;\n\nFresh linen: take time by the ears;\n\nThen Onegin swiftly dresses,\n\nOrders Guillot, since time presses,\n\nTo ready himself, have all in place,\n\nAnd not forget the pistol-case.\n\nThe sledge is waiting, at the door,\n\nHe’s in, and flying to the mill.\n\nArrived, asks Guillot if he will\n\nCarry the weapons, as before,\n\n(Lepage’s make, of course) and tie\n\nThe horses to the oak nearby.\n\n26.\n\nLeaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,\n\nResolute, impatient, waited,\n\nWhile, quite the engineer, Zaretsky,\n\nSurveyed it, and pontificated.\n\nEugene came to apologise,\n\n‘But where on earth,’ with surprise,\n\nZaretsky asked, ‘is your second?’\n\nIn matters of duelling reckoned\n\nA classicist, and pedant both,\n\nHe’d not allow a man to die\n\nJust anyhow and let him lie,\n\nBut by rule, and he was loath\n\nTo deviate from established ways\n\n(A predilection we should praise).\n\n27.\n\n‘My second?’ – echoes Yevgeny:\n\nHe’s here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.\n\nThat can’t be a problem, surely\n\nNot? Besides I’d have you know,\n\nThough he is unknown to you,\n\nHe is a man of honour too.’\n\nZaretsky bites his lip, crossly,\n\nWhile Onegin turns to Lensky:\n\n‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Begin, why not?\n\nVladimir replies. They start\n\nBehind the mill, while there, apart,\n\nZaretsky establishes what’s what\n\nWith the man of honour, and sighs;\n\nThe opponents wait, with downcast eyes.\n\n28.\n\nOpponents! They’d not long been parted\n\nBy this cruel thirst to kill each other.\n\nNot long before, tender-hearted,\n\nEach had acted like a brother,\n\nSharing pleasures, meals, and thought.\n\nNow hostility had brought\n\nOn nightmare, like those ancient feuds\n\nWhere in cold blood opposing broods,\n\nIn silence, plan each other’s slaughter.\n\nCould they not speak and smile again,\n\nBefore blood left its scarlet stain,\n\nPart in kindness, giving quarter? ...\n\nBut the world’s scornful expectation\n\nBreeds fear of reconciliation.\n\n29.\n\nPistols gleam, hammers are knocked\n\nOn ramrods, and they grate together,\n\nBullets are loaded, weapons cocked,\n\nInto the pans they sift the powder,\n\nThe jagged flints once firmly seated,\n\nAre raised again, the work’s completed.\n\nBehind the stump of a nearby tree\n\nPoor Guillot stands, uneasily,\n\nWhile Zaretsky measures nicely,\n\n– The duellists remove their cloaks,\n\nHere’s an end to all their jokes ­–\n\nThirty two paces, precisely.\n\nEach with a pistol in his hand,\n\nOpposite his friend must stand.\n\n30.\n\n‘Now, approach!’ Calm and steady,\n\nNot yet attempting to aim,\n\nThey’ve taken four steps already,\n\nFour fatal steps, to kill or maim.\n\nYevgeny, silently advances,\n\nRaises his pistol slowly, glances;\n\nFive more paces now they take;\n\nLensky, keen to avoid mistake,\n\nSquints, half-closes his left eye,\n\nA few steps from eternity,\n\nTakes aim now – when, suddenly,\n\nOnegin fires…the clock on high\n\nStrikes for the poet, at the sound,\n\nHis weapon spirals to the ground.\n\n31.\n\nPressing his hand to his heart,\n\nLightly, he falls. His gaze betrays\n\nNot pain, but death. So, at the start,\n\nOn a steep slope, in the sun’s rays,\n\nA block of snow will slowly glide,\n\nThen gather momentum in its slide.\n\nStruck by an icy chill, Onegin\n\nRuns to his friend, gazes at him,\n\nCalls out his name…uselessly:\n\nHe’s lost: the votary of rhyme,\n\nHas met his fate before his time,\n\nThe storm is done, and cruelly,\n\nThe flower has faded from the bough,\n\nThe altar-fire’s extinguished now.\n\n32.\n\nMotionless, like one dreaming,\n\nStrange his languor, there, at rest;\n\nBlood from his wound is streaming,\n\nThe bullet shattering his chest.\n\nA moment since, imagination\n\nHad fired this heart, pure inspiration,\n\nHope and love and enmity,\n\nA pulse, the blood’s living heat,\n\nNow like some deserted place,\n\nAll is silent, shuttered, still,\n\nWindows pale within, that fill\n\nWith shadows all its gloomy space,\n\nThe lady of the manse has fled.\n\nWhere to? God knows. The trail is dead.\n\n33.\n\nIt’s pleasant with a sharp remark\n\nTo infuriate your enemy,\n\nPleasant to see it hit the mark,\n\nAs he lowers horns, stubbornly,\n\nTo see, unwillingly, as they pass,\n\nHis own features in the glass;\n\nMore pleasant still, if he should cry,\n\nMy friends, in bending: ‘It is I!’\n\nBut the pleasantest thing of all\n\nIs to aim at his pallid face\n\nAcross a gentlemanly space,\n\nAnd anticipate his funeral.\n\nYet, should you succeed, beware,\n\nThere’s very little pleasure there.\n\n34.\n\nWhat if your pistol-shot inflicts\n\nA fatal wound on some young friend,\n\nWhose rash look or sneer conflicts\n\nWith your self-image? He may offend\n\nWith some nonsense while your drinking,\n\nIssue an angry challenge, thinking\n\nHe ought to do so – will your soul\n\nSummon sufficient self-control\n\nTo watch him lying on the ground,\n\nIn his face the pains of death,\n\nHearing his last failing breath,\n\nStiffening, as his friends stand round,\n\nDeaf, voiceless, never to reply,\n\nTo your heartfelt, despairing cry?\n\n35.\n\nStill clutching his pistol, tightly,\n\nGripped by feelings of remorse,\n\nEugene stares down at Lensky,\n\n‘Well?’ says Zaretsky, with force.\n\n‘Killed!’…And with that stark reply,\n\nOnegin shudders, turns, gives a cry\n\nSummons the servant for assistance;\n\nThen, at Zaretsky’s insistence,\n\nThey lift the cold body to its bier,\n\nPlacing it carefully in the sleigh,\n\nThen carry the dread thing away.\n\nThe horses scent the dead, and rear,\n\nSteel bits and traces flecked with foam,\n\nAs they fly like arrows towards home.\n\n36.\n\nFriends, for the poet now you sorrow,\n\nKilled before his promise bloomed,\n\nForced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,\n\nPrematurely blighted, doomed!\n\nWhere now are the burning passions,\n\nThose high aims ambition fashions,\n\nThat pure emotion youth may render,\n\nThoughts and feelings, noble, tender?\n\nWhere is the storm of love’s extremes,\n\nThat thirst for truth, toil’s midnight flame,\n\nThe fear of error, and of shame,\n\nAnd you, the bright celestial dreams,\n\nYou, phantoms born of reverie,\n\nYou, gleams of sacred poetry?\n\n37.\n\nPerhaps for glory he was created,\n\nOr to ease the world’s condition,\n\nPerhaps that lyre, to silence fated,\n\nMight have achieved its high mission,\n\nEchoing down the years. The poet\n\nMight have climbed Parnassus yet\n\nFound his place, or, martyred shade,\n\nInto the dark may have conveyed\n\nThe holy secret, lost forever,\n\nThe power of some life-giving voice\n\nTo make the soul of man rejoice,\n\nOne that, beyond the grave, never\n\nA hymn can reach, or people’s praise,\n\nOr gratitude from age to age.\n\n38-39.\n\nOr alternatively the poet\n\nMight have met the usual fate,\n\nYouth slipped by, years to forget,\n\nThe soul’s fire cooling of late.\n\nThe Muse he might well have deserted,\n\nSettled, to married life converted,\n\nDeep in the country, far from town,\n\nWorn horns, and a dressing-gown;\n\nAnd learned life’s bland reality:\n\nAt forty suffer from the gout,\n\nEat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,\n\nThen prove his own mortality,\n\nMidst swarms of children, lie in bed,\n\nDoctors, and weeping women, dead!\n\n40.\n\nWhatever the future might have brought,\n\nReader, alas, that tender lover,\n\nYoung poet of meditative thought,\n\nFell at a friend’s hand! You’ll discover,\n\nAs you leave the village, a place\n\nThat inspired soul knew, a space\n\nWhere the roots are intertwined\n\nOf two tall pines; where waters wind\n\nTowards the valley down below;\n\nWhere the ploughman likes to take\n\nHis rest; girl reapers, keen to slake\n\nTheir thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;\n\nWhere, above shadowy waters blent,\n\nThere stands a simple monument.\n\n41.\n\nNearby (when the furrows ooze\n\nWith the springtime showers again)\n\nThe shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,\n\nSings of the Volga fishermen;\n\nAnd the young city lady, down\n\nFor the summer, bored with town,\n\nRacing the meadowlands alone\n\nWill halt her horse beside the stone,\n\nGrip the reins, and from her hair\n\nLifting the gauzy veil may glance\n\nLightly at the lines, by chance,\n\nOf its inscription, feel pity there,\n\nOn reading their sad tale – surprise\n\nA haze of tears to cloud her eyes.\n\n42.\n\nThen, across the fields, slowly,\n\nBrooding silently, she’ll ride,\n\nLost in the depths of reverie,\n\nWith Lensky’s fate pre-occupied;\n\n‘And then what became of Olga?\n\nDid she pine for him?’ She’ll wonder;\n\n‘Or did her sorrow vanish swiftly?\n\nAnd what of her sister, where is she?\n\nAnd that fugitive from the world,\n\nThe smart coquettes’ smart enemy,\n\nThe gloomy eccentric, where is he,\n\nWho to his grave the poet hurled?\n\nAll in good time, trust me, I’ll try\n\nTo supply the details, by and by.\n\n43.\n\nBut not quite yet. Although I dearly\n\nLove my hero, as before,\n\nAnd promise you, most sincerely,\n\nI’ll return to him: no more!\n\nAge demands prose for a time,\n\nAge drives away the urchin, rhyme.\n\nAnd I –with a sigh, I confess –\n\nI now enjoy composing less.\n\nNow, I no longer rush to stain\n\nScattered reams with flying quill,\n\nAnother dream, and one more chill,\n\nAnother care, profounder pain,\n\nIn the world’s noise, or solitude,\n\nOn my troubled mind intrude.\n\n44.\n\nI’ve learnt to know another longing,\n\nI’ve learnt the sadness of tomorrow,\n\nIn yesterday there is no trusting;\n\nAnd I lament my former sorrow.\n\nThe dream! Where’s sweet elusive truth?\n\nAnd you (its rhyme forever) youth?\n\nCan it be true, that crown at last\n\nIs now quite withered by the blast?\n\nCan it be true, and not a mere\n\nConceit of elegiac verse,\n\n(That I’d once happily rehearse)\n\nMy springtime’s over, in the sere?\n\nCan it be true there’s no return?\n\nAnd thirty years the prize I earn?\n\n45.\n\nPale afternoon is here, my heart,\n\nConfess it now, behold: the truth.\n\nThen so be it: in friendship part,\n\nOh my frivolous lost youth!\n\nMy thanks for every sweet refrain,\n\nThe torments of the soul, the pain,\n\nThe noise, the tempests, and the feast,\n\nFor all your gifts, even the least,\n\nMy thanks. I took my joy, and more…\n\nLived you to the full, in riot,\n\nOr in solitude, and quiet;\n\nEnough! Again, my soul is pure;\n\nI travel another road, at last,\n\nFreed from the burdens of the past.\n\n46.\n\nBackward, I glance. Farewell the glade,\n\nWhere days flowed by so lazily,\n\nFilled with sweet passion, pensive shade,\n\nLong hours of idle reverie!\n\nAnd you, my youthful inspiration,\n\nFind fresh powers; Imagination,\n\nRouse the dull mind from sleep,\n\nVisit my humble corner, keep\n\nThe poet’s soul from every ill,\n\nLet it not wither, harsh and dry,\n\nOr worse still, freeze and petrify,\n\nIn society’s toils that kill,\n\nThe muddy pool, my friends, that we\n\nImmerse in, so relentlessly!"
