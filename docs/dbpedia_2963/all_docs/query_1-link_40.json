        "text": "I read this collection in college a long, long time ago, and recently reread it.\n\nPushkin is like the “father” of Russian literature. Before him, what limited literature there was in Russia mostly wasn’t in Russian. Educated, cultured Russians spoke—and wrote in—foreign languages, mostly French. There was some poetry in Russian—and indeed Pushkin himself wrote as much or more poetry as prose; his most famous work, Eugene Onegin, is in verse—but he was the first major prose writer in Russian.\n\nWhat’s surprising is how recent a figure he is—from the early 1800s. That’s a much, much later start than the literature of the other major European countries. And yet, in spite of that late start, for my money Russian literature reached a level as high as or higher than the literature of any other country. I mean, this is the nation of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gogol, etc., all of whom came along only very shortly after Pushkin got things started.\n\nThe frustrating thing about reading Pushkin’s prose tales is how many of them he never finished. This collection of all his prose contains ten tales, with one split into five different stories (so you could say there are either ten or fourteen total stories in the book), and of those, the five stories within that one story are complete, and three of the nine others are complete, leaving six incomplete.\n\nAnd they’re not incomplete in the sense that, say, Kafka’s novels are incomplete. Kafka’s novels lack an ending, but they’re long enough to be more or less full books. Plus, they are of such a weird, surreal style that it kind of makes sense for them not to end. Their lacking an ending arguably does not make them incomplete.\n\nBut Pushkin’s incomplete stories just end abruptly, like he wasn’t sure where he wanted to go next or how to get to where he wanted to go, or he got caught up in other projects and never got around to returning to them. (Part of the problem is that he died young, suddenly, in a duel at age 37.)\n\nPushkin’s prose style mostly fits me fine. His stories tend to be clear, straightforward, understandable, without being overly simplistic. They’re not convoluted and obscure, like postmodern novels that are less about substance than about showing off their style. To me, they aren’t as deep, powerful, enjoyable, and intense as, say, the best of Dostoyevsky, but this book is a good read.\n\nFirst up is The Moor of Peter the Great, one of the unfinished stories. Pushkin himself was actually related to a black African something like the title character.\n\nI found the depiction of Peter himself to be quite interesting. (I have no idea how historically accurate it is.) The Moor in question, Ibrahim, is not just some member of his entourage, and certainly not just some servant, but Peter’s godson. Peter has a warm relationship with him, and manifests no racial prejudice, no sense that there’s anything odd or inappropriate about a black man having such a position in his household.\n\nFurther, Peter has kind of a “regular guy” style to him. Not that he comes across as weak or lacking in authority, but he’s an avuncular type who tends to drop in on acquaintances without a lot of kingly pomp and rigmarole.\n\nIn the story, before it cuts off, Ibrahim spends an extended period of time in Paris, where to some extent he’s treated as a curiosity in society, but overall makes a more favorable than unfavorable impression. He has an affair with a French countess—not just a quick sexual fling; they fall in love with each other. She gives birth to his child. In order to keep her husband in the dark, their confederates had already obtained a white baby, such that if the baby came out black—which it did—they could do a quick switch. Their actual biological child is hustled off to the country somewhere to be raised apart from them.\n\nIbrahim soon returns to Russia at the Tsar’s request. He and the countess are distraught, but life goes on. He hears through the grapevine that she eventually takes a new lover. Meanwhile, the Tsar is arranging a marriage for him.\n\nThe story is useful for its depictions of both French high society and Russian high society during the Peter the Great era.\n\nA Novel in Letters, also unfinished, starts as an exchange of multiple letters between two female friends. One has gone to the country. Eventually she confesses that it was to escape a suitor. Not that she objects to his interest in her; it’s more a matter that she reciprocates his interest and isn’t sure she should. What if he should get what he wants from her, and then get bored and move on?\n\nWe then find out in later letters, including from the suitor to a friend of his, that he has pursued her to the country, which she, predictably, has mixed feelings about.\n\nSeeing how things develop psychologically with these characters is interesting to a degree, but then it ends before we find out what happens.\n\nThe selection with multiple stories (The Shot, The Blizzard, The Undertaker, The Postmaster, and The Squire’s Daughter) is The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovitch Belkin. Pushkin writes as an “editor” who is presenting these stories by some other, little known, author.\n\nI thought these stories were mostly decent. They held my interest. Some were a little hokey or gimmicky in style (e.g., excessive coincidences), but then I read online that apparently they were intended at least semi-satirically as lampoons of unsophisticated contemporary literary styles, which is perhaps why he made believe the stories were by someone else.\n\nThe Shot actually overlaps with the theme of an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, of all things.\n\nA man has the opportunity to kill his enemy. His enemy, though, comes across as completely indifferent to whether he lives or dies. They are having a duel, and his enemy shot first and missed—actually shot him through his hat, possibly purposely just barely missing to show he could have killed him had he chosen to. Now he is nonchalantly eating cherries while he waits to be shot. The man is infuriated by his apathy, and he shoots into the air.\n\nHe decides that what he really wants is to wait until his enemy is at a point when his life has value to him and it would be a big deal to him to lose it, and to kill him then instead. When he gets word that his enemy is to be married, he tracks him down.\n\nThings don’t go as expected.\n\nI didn’t care for the ending of The Blizzard (multiple of these have implausible O. Henry-twist endings; this is probably the silliest), but other than that it held my interest quite well.\n\nA young man and a young woman agree to marry despite not having their families’ permission to do so. They arrange to meet secretly at a church in a town about equidistant from each of their homes. Unfortunately a terrible blizzard strikes that day, and each has a more than harrowing journey to get to the meeting place.\n\nIt’s a well-written action story of fighting their way through the elements, where it’s touch and go if one, both, or neither will make it to the destination, and what will happen if they do or don’t.\n\nThe Undertaker is I suppose more of a humor story.\n\nAn undertaker takes umbrage at a party when the assembled guests are taking turns drinking to their customers that keep their businesses prosperous, and one of them jokingly suggests drinking to the corpses the undertaker has buried, and the others roar their approval with laughter.\n\nThe undertaker later grumbles to himself that though he had thought about giving a party for all these folks at his home, now he will cancel those plans. And as far as his “customers” that they seemed to find so amusing, he thinks, he’d prefer their company to this lot anyway.\n\nThen his wish comes true, sort of.\n\nIn The Postmaster, a widower adores his young daughter, and is crushed when she is taken off by a brash young suitor. The evidence implies that it was semi-consensual on her part; she wasn’t flat out kidnapped, but to the extent that she went along with what happened voluntarily it was an impulsive thing accompanied by significant misgivings at the time and significant regrets after, due to how it pains her to disappoint and hurt her father. The man tracks the couple down, but is unable to obtain the satisfaction he desires. He drinks himself to death and dies brokenhearted.\n\nIn The Squire’s Daughter, two landowners are in a feud with each other. The daughter of one is curious to check out the son of the other, but knows she could never get approval to meet him. So she disguises herself as a peasant girl and arranges to “accidentally” meet him. They not only meet, but end up falling for each other.\n\nThen the landowners reconcile, and it turns out the son and daughter could have met conventionally had she not jumped the gun with her ruse. But if she meets him now as herself, he’ll see that she tricked him.\n\nOf the five, The Blizzard has the most adventure and suspense. All are cute in their way, if kind of lightweight for the most part. Actually, with their mistaken identities, lovers’ plots, whimsical humor, etc., they kind of remind me of some of Shakespeare’s lighter works.\n\nNext up is The History of the Village of Gorukhino, which also purports to be by Ivan Petrovich Belkin, which is an indication that it too is intended at least semi-satirically. Indeed, I found a reference to it online indicating that it was a parody of a certain kind of popular local history of the time (an almanac kind of thing, perhaps?).\n\nThis one too was left unfinished, and it’s one of the ones I least got into, perhaps because I’m unfamiliar with the type of works that it parodies. Maybe it would have been more interesting had Pushkin gotten further into it.\n\nSome of it reads like more or less straight description, and some is more clearly ludicrous. A good example of the latter is when Belkin (i.e., Pushkin), describing the customs in the village he’s choosing to profile, states that when a couple marries, “For four or five years wives beat their husbands. After that, the husbands in turn used to beat their wives; and thus both sexes had their time of power, and a balance was achieved,” as if that’s all quite normal and unobjectionable, and indeed rather fair and equitable.\n\nOne of the shorter tales that Pushkin never finished is Roslavlev.\n\nEvidently there was a popular historical novel of the time called Roslavlev, or Russians in 1812. Pushkin’s story is sort of fan fiction. He takes characters from that novel and builds a new story around them (actually claiming, as a literary device, that the novel is based on real people and real events and that the story he tells is the factual version of the novel).\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of a teenage girl, who befriends another girl named Princess Polina. Polina is fiercely patriotic. When Napoleon invades Russia, she follows the news as closely as any man, fervently rooting for the Russian forces. When word comes that Moscow is in flames, she is horrified by the unspeakable barbarism of the French. But then when someone points out to her that the city was likely torched by the Russians themselves, and that this will doom the French army by rendering it unable to replenish its supplies, she reverses herself and praises the move: “Never again will Europe dare to fight with a people who chop off their own hands and burn their capital.”\n\nI found Dubrovsky, the second longest of the stories and yet another that Pushkin never finished, perhaps the most engaging story in the book.\n\nTroyekurov is a wealthy landowner who is eccentric, erratic, headstrong, a practical joker, domineering, corrupt, and frankly a sadist. He dominates all those around him, except his neighbor Dubrovsky who kind of tickles him with his independent spirit and unwillingness to bow down and kiss up to him like everyone else. He even talks of his daughter and Dubrovsky’s son marrying down the road, though Dubrovsky waves it off as an unsuitable match due to there being such a gap between the two families in terms of wealth and status.\n\nBut then the high-strung Troyekurov exaggerates something Dubrovsky did into a major insult, and he too finally gets on his shit list. In order to punish him, he spreads enough money around among the local judicial officials to get them to rule that Dubrovsky doesn’t actually own his property, and that it has belonged to Troyekurov all along. (Interestingly, Pushkin includes the several-page ruling to this effect, which is a real ruling from a real case where just this very skullduggery happened, with only the names of the parties, the name of the property, etc. changed.)\n\nThe furious and humiliated Dubrovsky falls seriously ill. His son Vladimir, who had been away in the military, returns to be with his father as he dies. He learns about the case Troyekurov brought and how the family was cheated out of their home and is about to be evicted. The household servants and serfs are distraught, as they are part of the property that will now belong to Troyekurov, and they would much prefer to stay with their beloved master Dubrovsky or now his son.\n\nVladimir is persuaded to defy Troyekurov. He ends up gathering all the servants and serfs who are willing into a sort of Robin Hood’s band of brigands, living in the woods and targeting only people associated with Troyekurov and those rich enough to be able to afford being robbed.\n\nHe eventually even insinuates himself, in disguise, into Troyekurov’s household in order to get close enough to kill him, though he changes plans when he finds himself falling in love with the daughter. (Clearly that’s a very common theme in these stories. Neighboring landowners routinely have a son and daughter reaching marriageable age about the same time, and the plot involves their falling for each other and being forbidden to marry, their not falling for each other when expected, their thinking they fell for someone else when one is an impostor, etc.)\n\nIt’s a good action story, and a good human story. And Troyekurov at times really does come across as a monster. Not just in his dishonesty, but in his torturing and killing people for sport. For instance, he enjoys chaining up a bear in a small room, getting it good and hungry and ferocious, and then throwing some victim in their as a gag, where there is at most some tiny sliver of space along one wall that the bear’s swiping claws can’t quite reach, and leaving the terrified fellow in there for hours or days to maybe find that sweet spot and maybe manage to stay there pinned against the wall all that time and survive—or maybe not.\n\nToo bad this one wasn’t finished; I would have liked to read the rest of it.\n\nThe Queen of Spades is perhaps the best known of these stories, and one of the few that Pushkin completed.\n\nA young man gets in over his head gambling and is ruined financially. He ceases gambling from that point forward, but the damage has been done and he is desperate. He learns of an old woman who seems to have some supernatural secret for knowing what cards will fall in certain situations so as to win big. But it’s all very mysterious and apparently limited in some way, as the evidence indicates she only used the power once in her entire life, and only told the secret of what cards to play to one other person, who also only used it once.\n\nHe tracks her down and eventually sneaks into her home and confronts her. He browbeats her into telling him her secret, telling him the guaranteed winning cards to play, and then she dies from the shock of the encounter.\n\nHe makes his one-time-only return to the gambling tables. At first the suggested plays work perfectly, but then it all blows up in his face. It is left ambiguous whether he simply panicked and screwed up due to being extremely emotional from the life-changingly high stakes and from guilt over the woman’s death, or she supernaturally fucked with him from beyond the grave.\n\nKirdjali, in spite of being one of the few completed stories in the collection, is also the shortest—roughly tied with the shortest of the “stories within a story” in The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovitch Belkin. Going along with that, it’s frankly also one of the most lightweight of the stories—there really seems little to it.\n\nIt is an anecdote from the life of a brigand, about how he escapes from the Turks who captured him. (Basically he is able to escape because they are very, very stupid.)\n\nEgyptian Nights is OK; I didn’t get into it as much as some of the others.\n\nA young Russian artist is visited by a stranger, an Italian who claims that he too is an artist but that he is penniless and desperately needs contacts to get his career going here in Russia. The Russian is if anything insulted by the stranger’s audacity and is inclined to tell him to scram. But then he discovers that the Italian is really talented and he agrees to help him get established after all.\n\nThe Italian’s artistic skill is as an improviser. Not an improv comic, but someone who can improvise a song and lyrics on the spot. (I think rappers and poets sometimes do this kind of thing, at “slams.”) He seems almost superhumanly good at it, thinking for only a few seconds about a topic he is given and then coming up with a long, involved song with multiple pages of detailed lyrics.\n\nThe story ends as he is wrapping up an especially impressive such improvisation based on a legend about Cleopatra that she was so desirable that when she offered to spend a night with someone sexually, with the price being that they would then be executed in the morning, several guys jumped at the opportunity.\n\nThe final selection in the book is The Captain’s Daughter, the longest story, and one of the ones that is complete.\n\nAt over a hundred pages, this one is long enough to be considered a novel, or at least a novella, and not just a short story.\n\nI put The Captain’s Daughter up there with Dubrovsky as my favorites in the book. There’s plenty of action, you get to know and care about multiple well-drawn characters, it’s psychologically interesting, the romance works, there’s a little humor, etc. Solid story all around.\n\nIt’s a historical novel. The protagonist, who had hoped to serve his time in the military in St. Petersburg, is instead sent by his father to serve out in the provinces in the sticks. Mostly he fits in and likes it better than he expected—though he does have a run-in with one comrade and fights a duel (sword fighting, not with guns)—becoming accepted as something of a member of the family by his commanding officer, the officer’s wife (who pretty much runs things de facto), and their teenage daughter (with whom he develops a romance).\n\nBut then the town where he is stationed is set upon by Pugachev and his forces. (Pugachev is a real life figure. His was the most serious of a series of uprisings by Cossacks, serfs, and others against Catherine the Great. He pretended to be the Tsar that Catherine had overthrown to seize power (her husband, Peter III) bent on reclaiming his throne. He came pretty close to pulling it off, too. It was the largest uprising in Russian history prior to the actual Russian Revolution.)\n\nI wouldn’t say this collection blew me away; I would have been surprised if it had, given that most of the stories are fragments. But I liked it more than not. I find Pushkin’s writing style agreeable, and the stories consistently held my interest and I enjoyed them at least modestly, sometimes considerably more. Had he written more such stories I’d have no hesitation about picking up and reading another such collection. This one’s a winner."
