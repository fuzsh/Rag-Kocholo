        "text": "The Top 10 Short Stories - Love\n\nShort stories have always been a sort of instant access into an author's brain, their soul and heart. A few pages can lift our lives into locations, people and experiences with a sweep of landscape, narration, feelings and emotions that is difficult to achieve elsewhere.In this series we try to offer up tried and trusted 'Top Tens' across many different themes and authors. But any anthology will immediately throw up the questions - Why that story? Why that author? The theme itself will form the boundaries for our stories which range from well-known classics, newly told, to stories that modern times have overlooked but perfectly exemplify the theme. Throughout the volume our authors whether of instant recognition or new to you are all leviathans of literature.Some you may disagree with but they will get you thinking; about our choices and about those you would have made. If this volume takes you on a path to discover more of these miniature masterpieces then we have all gained something.In this volume our classic authors turn their pens to the immortal quest for love. What they find and what they reveal are, of course, illuminating, beguiling and the best of magical literature.01 - The Top 10 - Love - An Introduction02 - Araby by James Joyce03 - A Modern Lover - Part 1 by D H Lawrence04 - A Modern Lover - Part 2 by D H Lawrence05 - The Fullness of Life by Edith Wharton06 - About Love by Anton Chekhov07 - Mr and Mrs Dove by Katherine Mansfield08 - The Blizzard by Alexander Pushkin09 - On the Gull's Road by Willa Cather10 - Madame Rose Hanie by Khalil Gibran11 - The Gift of the Magi by O Henry12 - The Nightingale and the Rose by Oscar Wilde\n\nAlexander Pushkin, Anton Chekhov, D.H.

Exposed to French culture at a young age, Pushkin's work reflects these sensibilities, and he combines this with stories of his Russian ancestors that his grandmother would relate to him and his siblings during their summers near Moscow. In the unfinished title story, \"Egyptian Nights,\" Charsky is ashamed of the way writers and poets are viewed in his society, so he tries to keep his identity as one a secret. But when an Italian improvisatore asks for help in finding a way to make money with his art, Charsky must confront what it means to be an artist in the public eye, and all the acclaim-and criticism-that comes with it. \"Marie\" is a timeless tale of love and duty that chronicles the romance between young Peter Grineff and Marie, his captain's daughter, during the rebellion of the Cossacks under the reign of Catherine the Great. In \"The Coffin-Maker,\" Adrian Prokhoroff, a rigid, unfriendly undertaker, moves his business and his two daughters to a new city. At his housewarming party, he must deal with some of his spookier clientele. And in \"The Queen of Spades,\" a young man who has always shied away from gambling is intrigued by the story of a Countess who won a large sum of money with a specific set of cards and then never played another hand. Eager to win a fortune for himself, he sets out to find the Countess and extract from her the combination of cards she played in that fateful game. Featuring these stories and more, Egyptian Nights and Other Tales of Imagination and Romance showcases Pushkin's unique voice and insightful prose from throughout his career.

Many of the greatest Russian authors, including Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Pushkin, produced crime and mystery fiction, a type of literature that was largely suppressed during the Soviet era because it did not glorify the state, but rather, gave significance to individual characters. With the fall of the Soviet Union, mystery writers have become some of the most successful novelists in Russia, and there is a renewed interest in, and appreciation of, the great crime classics of an earlier era. There have been few policemen, and virtually no private detectives or amateur sleuths, in Russian history worthy of approbation, and in consequence its literature is dramatically different from its Western counterparts. Criminals in Mother Russia tend to be caught or punished by their own consciences or by ghosts, and the notion of a criminal trial as we know it is utterly alien. Nonetheless, the enormous talent and passion of Russian authors has long been justly acclaimed, and the rare forays they made into the loosely defined genre of mystery fiction rank among the world's classics. This volume is the first collection ever devoted entirely to Russian crime fiction.\n\nAlexander Pushkin, Anton Chekhov, Boris Akunin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol, Vladimir Nabokov (Author), Bj Harrison (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nThe Coffin Maker\n\nAlexander Pushkin (1799-1837) leads the great names of Russian literature. After completing his education, Pushkin devoted himself to the pleasures of society, alongside his writing. In 1820 he was banished to the Caucasus for writing and promoting liberal views. Deprived of his social life, Pushkin devoted himself to his writing and bequeathed to the world some of the greatest poetry and stories ever written. He met his death in a duel in 1837. The Coffin Maker tells the story of Adrian Prokhoroff, a funeral director who, in a drunken rage, shouts out an invitation to all his customers to a party at his house...and unleashes a scene of grisly horror.\n\nAlexander Pushkin (Author), Cathy Dobson (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nThe Pistol-Shot\n\nAlexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (1799 – 1837) was a Russian author of the Romantic era who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature. He was notoriously sensitive about his own personal honour and is believed to have fought as many as twenty-nine duels... the last of which proved fatal for him. A duel is the crux of his masterful short story The Pistol-Shot - but it is a duel with a difference. It starts out normally enough... an insult, a challenge, a meeting with pistols at dawn. But when the first shot misses, the insolent nonchalence of the first shooter (who goes on eating cherries while is adversary takes aim) prompts the other dueller to delay taking his shot until such a time as shall suit him. He is determined to pick a moment when death will be most unwelcome and inconvenient for his adversary. One day a letter arrives for him... and he knows that the moment has come.\n\nAlexander Pushkin (Author), Cathy Dobson (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free"
