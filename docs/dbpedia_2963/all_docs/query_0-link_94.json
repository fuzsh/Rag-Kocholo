        "text": "First, there was It Happened One Night in 1934, then One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1975. The only other film in history to achieve the “grand slam,” meaning all five top Academy Awards, is 1991’s The Silence of the Lambs, which won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay. It defied the odds in other ways as well. This outstanding psychological thriller, also the first winner in the horror genre, didn’t open during “Oscar Season,” which characteristically runs from late fall up until Christmas Day. Instead, it went into wide release on February 14th. That’s right, Valentine’s Day. The movie was a sleeper hit, gathering momentum by word of mouth, racking up ticket sales and critical raves, which kept it afloat through the spring, summer, fall, and into … well, Oscar Season.\n\nJodie Foster carries this film as FBI trainee Clarice Starling. Her performance exudes restless restraint. We glimpse her inner thoughts, feelings, and most private fears only at key moments—and those reveals are spectacular. Her vulnerability becomes her strength, which Hannibal Lector appreciates. Foster was already an Oscar-winner (for The Accused), but she wasn’t the first choice for this role. Director Jonathan Demme offered it to Michelle Pfeiffer, then Meg Ryan. Both actresses turned him down because of the gruesome subject matter. Demme wanted Laura Dern next, but she wasn’t a box-office draw, according to the higher-ups in Hollywood. Lucky for us, Foster persisted and won the role.\n\nAnthony Hopkins delivers a performance for the ages as incarcerated serial-killer Hannibal Lector, often cited at the very top of the list for “greatest movie villains.” Hopkins wasn’t the first choice either, but Sean Connery declined—and the rest is history. It’s quite remarkable, considering the character’s screen time is just under 25 minutes, the second shortest ever to generate a Best Actor win. In addition, it’s rare for a villain to prevail in a leading category.\n\nMuch of the success of this film is due to Foster and Hopkins’ work, which is confined to a string of one-on-one scenes that have the impact of a finely tuned, two-character play. Demme and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto capture their probing faces at odd angles, extreme closeups, and tricky two-shots, using a wall of reflective, bullet-proof glass that divides them to great effect. Unsettling key-lighting, particularly in their eyes, elevates the chill-factor, and the cat-and-mouse dialogue is lean and focused from Oscar-winner Ted Tally. It’s the springboard for these two characters to peel away at each other in a nail-biting “game” of quid pro quo.\n\nThe plot builds with a genuine sense of urgency as Starling and the FBI’s behavioral science unit led by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) try to stop a serial killer at large called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who skins young, heavyset females after murdering them. Starling does her best to draw information and insight from Lector, who knew the killer’s first victim as one of his former psychiatric patients. A game of bartering begins, and everything kicks into high gear when a prominent U.S. senator (Diane Baker) discovers her daughter Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith) has disappeared and will likely become Bill’s next victim if they don’t act within a three-day window to save her.\n\nThe final section of the film features two masterful twists that still render me breathless, no matter how many times I watch this movie. Spoilers ahead, for those who haven’t seen it …\n\nLector’s escape is first. He dons the facial skin of a dead police officer and wears it like a mask as they rush the (perceived) officer to the hospital in an ambulance. To watch this “shell game” play out as he suddenly sits up on the gurney and removes the bloody skin from his own face is truly terrifying. The second gasp-inducing twist involves the SWAT team led by Crawford as they move in on the suspect’s house. The editing and pacing are brilliant, and so is the cross-cutting between the front doorbell ringing and Jame Gumb (aka “Buffalo Bill”) going to answer it. As Gumb opens his door, we see Agent Starling instead, standing alone. The SWAT team is at the wrong house, and Starling has stumbled upon the killer’s creepy abode without any backup.\n\nThe music must be mentioned, and it’s a shame the Academy didn’t honor it. Howard Shore, who won a trio of Oscars for the Lord of the Rings films, establishes an atmosphere of monumental sadness throughout the story. His haunting score elevates the intimacy of this character study to operatic proportions. The orchestra seems to mourn for everyone concerned, and I don’t think this movie would have nearly the impact without his contribution.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is an unusual choice for Best Picture, but I welcome the change. It’s certainly first-rate filmmaking in all respects.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nDirector Jonathan Demme Primary Cast Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald, Brooke Smith, Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Frankie Faison, Roger Corman, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak Familiar Faces Roger Corman from The Godfather Part II Firsts First horror film to win Best Picture Total Wins 5 (Picture, Director, Actor: Anthony Hopkins, Actress: Jodie Foster, Screenplay: Adapted) Total Nominations 7 (Picture, Director, Actor: Anthony Hopkins, Actress: Jodie Foster, Screenplay: Adapted, Editing, Sound) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc\n\nDances with Wolves is an epic, sprawling Western, only the second film from that genre after Cimarron in 1931 to win Best Picture, but perhaps it’s a bit too sprawling these days. As with other recent home-video releases for Amadeus, The Last Emperor, and future winner The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Dances with Wolves is presented in a Special Edition, adding a whopping 55 minutes to the running time. This extended cut first ran in movie theatres only a few years after the original release, and the film now clocks in just shy of four hours. The three-hour theatrical version is harder to come by, although you can find it in a pricey, three-disc, Blu-ray set by Shout! Factory. Amadeus still doesn’t have an HD version of the original edit available. Both versions of The Last Emperor and Return of the King are for sale, so at least you can decide which one to watch. I have mixed feelings about this revisionist history. I’m fine with new edits, especially if they improve or enhance a film—but for history’s sake and fans who remember their introduction to a movie a certain way, I don’t think that experience should be forgotten or buried. I’m reminded of George Lucas dismissing the past and cutting into his negatives for the original Star Wars movies to give us special editions. I was thrilled when Sony released Close Encounters of the Third Kind on Blu-ray and recently UHD/4K. All three edits are included—theatrical, special edition, and director’s cut—using seamless branching on the same disc. Viewers can choose for themselves which path to take.\n\nBe that as it may, I saw Dances with Wolves in a movie theatre when it first came out, and I was impressed and moved by it. Today, I’m watching the Special Edition (no longer noted as such) on Blu-ray, and in all honesty, the four-hour running time without an intermission is a hindrance. I take breaks if I need to, and I need to. Pressing the “pause button” is inevitable. The story is well paced in the first half, but the last stretch of it feels bloated, particularly during the romance between Costner and McDonnell’s characters where a lot of the additional footage was inserted. Still, the payoff at the end is worth it. The final hour is overwhelming and heart-wrenching. A profound sadness washes over me when the Lakota tribe is forced off their land and destroyed for the sake of “American progress.” It’s a story that needs to be told … and on this scale.\n\nOur window into the world of the Plains Indians is Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Kevin Costner, serving triple duty on this film as lead actor, director, and co-producer), but the story doesn’t begin there. We find Dunbar and other soldiers injured during a Civil War battle in 1863, and while the exhausted Tennessee doctors discuss amputating his leg, a delirious Dunbar shoves his blood-soaked boot back on and escapes from the hospital tent. A standoff between the North and South at St. David’s Field ends in utter chaos when Dunbar mounts a horse and rides with his arms outstretched through the open field separating the two armies. This stunning attempt at martyrdom is enough of a distraction to allow the Union Army to attack. Dunbar ultimately receives a bravery citation as well as the use of the general’s private surgeon. Following a full recovery (and no leg amputation), Dunbar is awarded Cisco, the horse he commandeered for his fearless stunt. He is also allowed a choice of posts, and as soon as he arrives at Fort Hays, he informs Major Fambrough (Maury Chaykin in a fascinatingly unhinged performance) that he wishes to be transferred to the western frontier so he can “see it before it disappears.” Fambrough literally scribbles the order on a piece of paper, assigning Dunbar to Fort Sedgwick, the furthest outpost available. Then he orders Timmons (Robert Pastorelli), an obnoxious mule-wagon provisioner, to serve as his guide. After a mock-salute, Fambrough stands alone in his office and observes Dunbar from his window before putting a pistol to his head and blowing his brains out.\n\nDunbar arrives at Fort Sedgwick to find it deserted. Determined to remain in the wilderness, he keeps a journal of his solitary experiences as he sets up life at the post. While it’s well written, some of the voiceover narration just doesn’t work. Kostner sounds detached and disinterested rattling off his diary entries. In time, a lone wolf shows up and keeps him company from a safe distance. Dunbar names him Two Socks, due to his white forepaws. Eventually, a group of nearby Sioux dwellers approaches on horseback. They include a peace-minded “holy man” named Kicking Bird (Graham Greene in an Oscar-nominated performance) and a hostile warrior named Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant, equally effective). A fundamental trust between them is established over time, and when Dunbar sets out to find their camp, he encounters a distraught woman alone, covered in her own blood. He brings her to the tribe where some assume he is the cause of her condition. We learn she is a White woman named Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell, also Oscar-nominated), who has lived with them since she was a little girl when her family was massacred by the Pawnee. She is recently widowed, and her act of self-mutilation is a rite of passage while in mourning. Stands with a Fist remembers some English from her early childhood, and she serves as interpreter between Dunbar and the Lakota elders. Dunbar soon realizes that everything he was taught about “these savage people” is untrue.\n\nHe agrees to help with their annual buffalo hunt, which sustains the tribe for the remainder of the year. After he spots a massive herd roaming nearby, he is more accepted and respected in their community. He is also drawn to Stands with a Fist, and the two soon fall in love.\n\nAnother distraction for me is that when Dunbar begins to transition into a full-fledged member of their tribe, his hair develops into a 1990s mullet. Coiffed on top, clipped close on the sides, and long in back. Yup, a mullet. McDonnell, who is very good in her role, also suffers from “salon syndrome,” sporting a jostled, high part with feathery bangs and shaggy tresses that cascade around her neck in highlighted streaks of well-planned color. It’s not just a bit off, it’s a gigantic misstep from the hair department on this film. It undermines McDonnell’s credibility as a result, which is a shame. So much care and attention went into dialects, rituals, locations, and cultural accuracy, but the ball was dropped on this obvious detail. I suppose I can excuse the ’60s beehives in a movie like My Fair Lady, because they’re not striving for authenticity (although they’re pretty bad, too), but in a film like this, it’s a glaring blunder.\n\nThe last hour of the movie yields one heartbreak after another. With the oncoming threat of more Pawnee attacks and murderous White settlers, the tribe plans to move to their winter camp. Dunbar realizes that he left his journal at the abandoned Fort Sedgwick, and before he joins them, he must return to fetch it, since it describes every detail needed to trace them.\n\nDunbar arrives on horseback to find Fort Sedgwick occupied by U.S. Army soldiers, and due to his native clothing, he is mistaken for a Sioux. They open fire, killing his beautiful horse Cisco. Dunbar is captured and arrested as a traitor where he is interrogated and brutally beaten. His refusal to cooperate ends in a formal charge of desertion. Preparations are then made to transport him back east, and when they head out, Two Socks, the devoted wolf that Dunbar “danced” with (giving him his titular Lakota name), is used for target practice by the soldiers. He is shot and killed. Watching this troop from Dunbar’s evolved perspective is an eye-opener. They are nothing short of entitled monsters, destroying everything in sight without concern or provocation. Thankfully, the tribe catches up with the convoy, killing these soldiers and freeing Dunbar, who sheds all remaining connections with his origins. He is Dances with Wolves now.\n\nUpon arrival at the winter camp, Dances with Wolves announces he will leave with his wife Stands with a Fist, fearing that if he remains, he would endanger the tribe. It’s a bittersweet coda to the film. Actually, it’s more than that—it’s deeply sobering and sad. The young warrior Smiles A Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, in a memorable performance) gives Dances with Wolves his recovered journal. Wind in His Hair shouts to him from a distance, proclaiming their friendship, and as they venture out, leaving their tribe for good, we see U.S. army troops searching the mountains in vain while a lone wolf howls. A title card at the end informs us that 13 years later, the last remaining Sioux were subjugated by the American government, bringing an end to the conquest of the great plains. This heartfelt story of a man who is accepted by his enemies, and whose perspective of them shifts 180 degrees, reaches its inevitable conclusion.\n\nDances with Wolves\n\nDirector Kevin Costner Primary Cast Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A.

I feel as if I’m watching a two-hour car accident with all the hellish, gory details drawn out. A two-hour rape, a two-hour torture, a two-hour murder. It makes me cringe for the duration and leaves me sad, angry, and disgusted. The sheer impact of it is effective, all right—but is it any good?\n\nCharlie Sheen is serviceable as Chris Taylor, the protagonist inspired by writer-director Oliver Stone and his actual experiences in the Vietnam War. At times, Sheen is downright bad in the role, smirking or throwing lines away like a disinterested amateur. Other times, he rises to the occasion well enough, but his performance, like his spiky ’80s hairdo, is largely off the mark for me.\n\nThis grim story is told from Chris’s viewpoint during a volunteer tour of duty. It takes us from the moment of his arrival to the moment of his departure, which is the whole plot. There is little in the way of backstory or character development between the opening and closing credits. At first, Chris writes to his grandmother back home, which serves as voiceover narration and offers some minimal insight. He doesn’t mention his parents, but it’s clear they don’t have a relationship to speak of. Later, as the days stretch on, he stops writing. Thus ends any insight. Chris is assigned to a platoon near the Cambodian border led by Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses), an inexperienced, affable guy who struggles with his own authority. Instead, the infantry takes their marching orders from two seasoned, subordinate vets, representing polar-opposite perspectives on how to navigate the war. Both Oscar-nominated actors were cast against type, which is refreshing and works well. Tom Berenger is the scar-faced Sergeant Barnes, a hardened, brutal, “death machine” with little regard for anyone around him. Willem Dafoe is Sergeant Elias Grodin, who still has a glimmer of humanity left in him.\n\nThe story is basically a string of horrific, nightmarish episodes that take place in the bug-infested jungles of Vietnam and neighboring Cambodia. One gruesome scenario after another. The most god-awful is the destruction of a small village with its families, including the spontaneous torture of a one-legged man and the murder and rape of women and children. There is no doubt war brings out the worst in people. War has no logic when you’re on the front lines. It’s not about ideas and ideals there. Morals are obliterated when everyone is trying to kill everyone else. The devil is in the details, as they say, and this film presents nothing but details.\n\nPerhaps that’s why, when all is said and done, I’m shocked and overwrought by Platoon, but I’m not necessarily moved by it or engaged with the story. This film doesn’t have the encompassing critical or poetic perspective of prior winner All Quiet on the Western Front. It lacks the fascinating character study at the core of a film like Patton. It’s missing the anchoring backstories of The Deer Hunter. It’s just war … for two relentless hours.\n\nOscar-winning editor Claire Simpson chose a temp track for the score while she worked on this film—Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” from 1936—and it stayed in the picture. It was used with great success a few years prior to Platoon in The Elephant Man (1980), and my father recalled radio stations playing it for 24 hours straight, the day Franklin Roosevelt died. It’s one of the saddest and most profoundly beautiful pieces of music I’ve ever heard, and it helps elicit the lacking but expected emotions in response to all the devastation.\n\nOliver Stone set out to deliver a sobering antidote to Hollywood’s interpretation of the Vietnam War with such films like The Green Berets. He attempts to show us what the experience was like for him and so many others. In that respect, he succeeds. The movie feels like a factual account, and I’m left reeling after I see it. It provides audiences with the nightmare and lets us try to make sense of it … if we even can.\n\nSome call it brilliant. I think Stone misses a great opportunity to let us know what he thinks and how he feels about it. Still, this “two-hour nightmare” was powerful enough to leave its mark while capturing the Academy’s top honor.\n\nPlatoon\n\nDirector Oliver Stone Primary Cast Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, Mark Moses, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, Johnny Depp Familiar Faces none (no repeat performers from the previous winning films) Firsts None to speak of Total Wins 4 (Picture, Director, Editing, Sound) Total Nominations 8 (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor: Tom Berenger, Supporting Actor: Willem Dafoe, Screenplay: Original, Cinematography, Editing, Sound) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc\n\nWhile Amadeus is only inspired by the lives and alleged rivalry of 18th-century composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it manages to create two fascinating and indelible characters for the ages. I find myself immersed in the story, details, music, atmosphere, time period, locations, and revelatory moments each time I see it. Based on the Tony Award–winning play by Peter Shaffer, this film doesn’t mark the first time these two iconic artists have been pitted against each other for dramatic purposes. Rumors circulated right away around the untimely death of young Mozart, and the notion was popularized by an Alexander Pushkin play in 1830 called Mozart and Salieri. Rimksy-Korsakov’s operatic adaptation of the Pushkin play followed nearly 70 years later, yet few facts were retained in either. Flash forward another 90 years, and Shaffer focuses his impressions of this legendary conflict on the larger themes of jealousy, mediocrity, aspiration, inspiration, and God-given talent, then weaves them with a masterful eye into a devastating tale of revenge.\n\nA relative unknown at the time, F. Murray Abraham gained instant notoriety when he delivered an astonishing, Oscar-winning performance as Salieri. He recounts the compelling events from several decades earlier, reliving the past through his own recollections. For the play, Salieri spoke straight to the audience in a series of monologues. In the film, the aging court composer attempts suicide during the opening scene and is brought to a gruesome asylum for the insane where a priest (Richard Frank) is summoned to hear his confession. The monologues from the play become his candid responses to the priest on screen. It’s a brilliant use of the source material and a perfect conceptual device to retain it.\n\nSomething seems fresh and different about this movie, and it might not be evident at first. In time, it becomes apparent that the principal cast for this story, set in Vienna, is largely American. And they speak with American accents, a conscious and somewhat unorthodox decision made by director Milos Forman (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest). He wanted his Austrians and Germans to sound comfortably familiar to the largest movie-going audience. By contrast, the characters from surrounding countries adopt their appropriate regional flair. Even Mr. Abraham has a slight Italian lilt on occasion as Salieri. I’m not sure why period dramas in particular, no matter where they’re set, are nearly always populated with British accents. We’ve come to expect them. Perhaps it’s due to the many historical offerings from the BBC. Since none of these characters in Amadeus would speak English as a native tongue, there is no reason for this assumption. Forman understood this. And as a result, even the handful of British actors who play Austrians (Roy Dotrice, Simon Callow, and Barbara Bryne) get by with their best attempt at American dialects.\n\nWhile the tale is told through Salieri’s aged eyes, the plot revolves around the life of Mozart (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce). The renowned prodigy and gifted composer is presented as a brash, bawdy, reckless young man with a high-pitched laugh and little discipline, except when it comes to music. His unique talent is exploited at an early age as a curiosity, a freak of nature performing “tricks” for the royal courts of Europe. The way Salieri sees it, Mozart grows up to be a crude brat who has been touched by God. Why him? Why would God bestow one of his greatest gifts on such an unworthy creature? Salieri works tirelessly to achieve his own meager successes. And while he is heralded as the court composer of Vienna with many admirers, including the emperor himself (Jeffrey Jones), he also realizes his talent pales in comparison to Mozart’s, and the notion eats away at him.\n\nSalieri’s jealousy isn’t limited to music. He lusts after Mozart’s bride Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), a sweet young woman with ample bosom and a winning smile—and although Salieri pledges his chastity as proof to God of his undying devotion to writing music, he toys with Constanze when she pays him a secret visit to help her husband secure a royal teaching job.\n\nIt should be noted I’m watching the “Director’s Cut” on Blu-ray, which restores a full 20 minutes of footage to the running time. Some complain it slows the movie down, but I disagree. It adds key motivation on three occasions, two of which concern the primary women in Mozart’s life. For the theatrical release, Constanze’s behavior toward Salieri seems over-the-top and perhaps unwarranted. She is blatantly repulsed by his presence in their home as she discovers he is helping Mozart transcribe the Requiem. But in the Director’s Cut, we learn early on that Salieri attempted to seduce her. During that same secret visit described above, the scene continues, and Salieri asks that she return later that evening as payment for the favor. He goes so far as to demand that Constanze remove her clothing (the new footage elevates this film’s MPAA rating from PG to R), which she does with great reluctance but also an understanding that it will help her husband. Her love for Mozart is greater than her own self respect. With Constanze’s crumpled dress down around her ankles, Salieri summons a servant to escort her from the premises. It’s a stunning moment of abject humiliation, and it explains her open disdain for him later in the film. She knows who he is and what he’s capable of, none of which is clear in the theatrical release. The other two instances of embellishment concern Mozart’s beautiful mistress, the operatic diva Katarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole) in an extended dressing-room sequence, and the addition of a nouveau-riche character (Kenneth McMillan) and his wife, dogs, and talentless daughter. This tacky entourage was cut from the original release, but their tasteless presence shows what it was like for Mozart to have to teach people like this and how beholden he was to them for financial support.\n\nSalieri does his level best to destroy Mozart. He seeks revenge against God for denying him such talent. In the end, he succeeds by honing in on Mozart’s obsession with his own father’s acceptance, then driving him to the point of extinction with it. The incredible scene where an ailing Mozart lies on his deathbed while dictating the last pages of his Requiem to Salieri is one of the finest examples of an artist’s mind at work ever filmed. The creative process isn’t explained in dialogue but by doing. “I can’t tell you how this works, but I can show you,” in other words. Salieri’s mind is blown and rightfully so.\n\nAll aspects of this movie are perfectly rendered, from the glorious sets and costumes, to the natural source lighting used in every shot, to the uniquely stylized choreography by Twyla Tharp. Then there’s Mozart’s music, which speaks for itself throughout. Amadeus is a modern masterpiece, among the best screen adaptations of a stage play ever filmed, and one of my favorite Oscar-winners of all time.\n\nAmadeus\n\nDirector Milos Forman Primary Cast F.
