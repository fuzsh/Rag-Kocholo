        "text": "The film “Commando” released in 1985 and directed by Mark L. Lester holds a significant place in pop culture due to its impact on the action movie genre and its portrayal of firearms. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in a relentless role, the film contributed to shaping the quintessential action hero archetype that would become emblematic of the 1980s. “Commando” pushed the boundaries of on-screen action with its intense, over-the-top sequences, establishing a template for subsequent action films to follow.\n\nMovie Guns @ TFB:\n\nThe film’s depiction of firearms played a pivotal role in shaping the public’s perception of weaponry in cinema in the 1980s as “Commando” showcases an array of iconic firearms. The film’s combination of Schwarzenegger’s muscular presence and the arsenal of firearms he wields became emblematic of the tough, unyielding action hero archetype. This portrayal of firearms as tools of empowerment and essential components of action narratives not only left an indelible mark on pop culture but also influenced subsequent films, TV shows, and video games, impacting the aesthetics and storytelling dynamics of the action genre for years to come. That was until the year 1989 with the release of a film called “Die Hard” Here are a few of the notable firearms from Commando.\n\n(Note: All screenshots from the film have been brightened and enhanced in this article)\n\nDesert Eagle Mark 1\n\nStarting with an oldy but goody and a staple of 80’s action films, the matte stainless Desert Eagle Mark I is the sidearm carried by Matrix during the assault on Arius’ mansion in the climax of the film. Aside from the film “Year of the Dragon”, this is one of the first Hollywood films to feature the classic hand cannon.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768761\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-1OYN9HH9c\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"g-1OYN9HH9c\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\nASP\n\nWhile most people my age will remember this pistol more from the Call of Duty video game franchise, it can be seen being welding by Sully before Matrix lies and kills him, not last.\n\nThe ASP pistol was a reimagined iteration of the Smith & Wesson Model 39 or 39-2 handgun, undergoing a series of meticulous modifications to optimize its performance. These alterations encompassed several key aspects: a shortened slide for improved handling, a fixed bushing that replaced the original collet bushing, and the incorporation of a unique Guttersnipe sight system to enhance accuracy. The pistol’s aesthetic was further characterized by clear Lexan grip panels, offering a visual glimpse into its inner mechanics. Notably, the barrel was expertly shortened, fully ramped, and throated to ensure heightened functionality, while the overall design was painstakingly smoothed and radiused to eliminate the risk of snagging during quick draws. This comprehensive redesign of the ASP pistol not only showcased a harmonious fusion of style and utility but also underscored its distinctiveness in terms of both form and function.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768764\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB6pvQt0I8s\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"zB6pvQt0I8s\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768767\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4trmOFxuJw0\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"4trmOFxuJw0\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\nIMI Uzi\n\nOne of the weapons used by Matrix is the full-size IMI Uzi. He uses the Uzi when stealing the seaplane to reach Arius’ compound and during the final battle.\n\nH&K 91 A2\n\nDuring the assault on his residence, which results in the abduction of his daughter Jenny, John Matrix (portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger) procures a Heckler & Koch HK91 from his arsenal located in the tool shed. Notably, the HK91 featured in this scene is a semi-automatic rifle variant, distinct from the select-fire G3. The HK91 is equipped with a receiver offering only two firing modes: Safe and Fire, making it a semi-automatic firearm rather than the fully automatic G3 counterpart.\n\nM16 A1\n\nYou can observe multiple instances of M16A1 rifles being featured. These rifles are utilized by U.S. military personnel as well as certain individuals belonging to Arius’ group (portrayed by Dan Hedaya). One of these rifles is taken over and utilized by the protagonist, John Matrix (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger). Notably, most of the M16 rifles showcased in the film are equipped with 20-round magazines, although a subset of them features 30-round magazines.\n\nIn the final battle scene, there is the dynamic transformation of firearms in use. As the sequence unfolds, the rifles in the hands of both actors and stunt performers shift back and forth between the original M16 (SP1) models and the M16A1 variations. Maybe an editing mistake or maybe an armorer mistake.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768770\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-reK6pGk8to\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"-reK6pGk8to\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\nRuger Mini-14 GB\n\nGun hipsters rejoice with the inclusion of this variant of the Ruger Mini-14 in this film. The henchmen working for the character Arius are shown employing Ruger Mini-14 GB rifles that are outfitted with factory folding stocks. These henchmen are observed engaging in gunfire directed at the protagonist, John Matrix (portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger), during various scenes. Notably, certain instances depict them utilizing these Ruger Mini-14 GB rifles in their final moments before succumbing to their adversaries. A point of interest is the diversity in the types of Ruger rifles employed by Arius’ men, with some featuring stainless steel and others blued finishes.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768782\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iE57MmibV9s\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"iE57MmibV9s\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\nRemington 870 (customized with LPC sight)\n\nJohn Matrix wields a Remington 870 shotgun during the raid on Arius’ compound. The shotgun is notable for its long barrel and a distinctive under-barrel laser sight. This laser sight is often mistaken for an extended magazine tube due to its appearance. However, there are continuity errors throughout the film’s sequence involving the shotgun. These errors involve changes in the shotgun’s features, such as the forend and the positioning of the sling. These inconsistencies in the film’s portrayal make it challenging to definitively identify the shotgun type with complete certainty.\n\nThe laser sight on the Remington 870 shotgun is a specialized accessory manufactured by Laser Products Corporation (later known as Surefire). This particular laser sight is recognizable by its unique “clamp” design, as well as the distinctive “bell-shaped” end of the sight. This type of laser sight was also used in other movies like “The Terminator” and “Wanted: Dead or Alive.”\n\nIt’s important to note that continuity errors are not uncommon in movies, especially in action sequences involving firearms. Filmmakers often prioritize visual appeal and pacing over strict accuracy, leading to inconsistencies in the portrayal of weapons and equipment.\n\nThe Valmet M78/83\n\nThe Valmet M78 is among the weapons employed by John Matrix during the assault on Arius’ base. The Valmet M78 shares a visual resemblance with the RPK, although there are several distinct differences, such as an alternate muzzle brake, variations in the front sight assembly, and other structural dissimilarities. This light machine gun is characterized by a standard “RPK style” buttstock, which offers ergonomic support.\n\nThe particular variant featured in the film is the Valmet M78/83, which is recognizable by its synthetic thumbhole “Dragunov-style” stock. This type of stock design is similar to the one found on the Soviet SVD Dragunov sniper rifle.\n\nThe Valmet M78 series of light machine guns is available in two different calibers: 7.62x51mm (.308) and 7.62x39mm.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768797\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLfl76lncXQ\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"MLfl76lncXQ\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }\n\nM60E3\n\nThe M60E3 machine gun makes its first appearance as one of the weapons stored in the concealed armory within a surplus store. John Matrix tries to acquire the M60E3 but is stopped by the intervention of the police. Later in the film, one of Arius’ henchmen employs the M60E3 near a tool shed, and subsequently, Matrix seizes control of the weapon and uses it himself.\n\nAn intriguing detail about the M60E3 in the movie is that it features a shortened barrel, which differs from the standard M60E3 configuration. This shorter barrel is notable for being several inches less in length compared to the typical M60E3 setup.\n\nThe presence of the M60E3 and its unique attributes adds an element of authenticity and firepower to the film’s action scenes, even though variations from real-world specifications are not uncommon in movie portrayals of firearms.\n\nM202 FLASH\n\nThe M202 FLASH rocket launcher is another weapon featured during the final battle scenes. The M202 FLASH, which stands for “Flame Assault Shoulder Weapon,” is a four-barreled rocket launcher. In the movie, this weapon is notably utilized by Cindy, played by Rae Dawn Chong, to flip the police van carrying John Matrix after he’s apprehended for his actions.\n\nInterestingly, the M202 FLASH depicted in the film is not an authentic, functional weapon, but rather a prop replica designed for cinematic purposes. This prop replica, while not a true-to-life M202 FLASH, has become widely recognized due to the film’s popularity. As a result, other media, such as non live-action works, have incorporated depictions of M202s based on this prop rather than the actual weapon.\n\nThe inclusion of the M202 FLASH in “Commando” adds to the over-the-top action and firepower characteristic of the film’s genre. It’s a testament to the impact of the movie that its portrayal of the M202 FLASH has influenced subsequent works and depictions of the weapon.\n\n{ \"id\": \"14768800\", \"alt\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"video_link\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sfObcMWpub4\", \"youtube_video_id\": \"sfObcMWpub4\" }\n\n{ \"width\": 634, \"height\": 357, \"showRelated\": true }"
