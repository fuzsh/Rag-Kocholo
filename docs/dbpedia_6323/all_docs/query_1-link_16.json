        "text": "The book started off with the narrator just telling us the time and place of the story, but it was done in such an unusual yet beautiful way. This first chapter was *chef’s kiss* amazing and at this point – it’s very hard to explain why – I was already blown away. The writing is truly lovely – again, I cannot explain why; I just feel mesmerized by it – and the amount of detail is unbelievable. Some details are kinda irrelevant to the story an sich, however, they add so so so much humour and irony to it that I do not mind them being there. In fact, I do not think Dog Island would be Dog Island without those details.\n\nI definitely came across a new favourite here! Claudel’s Dog Island has exactly the right mix of humour/irony, suspicious activity and weirdness. Some incredibly weird things happen on the island and its people are no doubt hiding something. My notes literally go from “Is the Mayor hiding something? He’s suspicious…” to “oh, he’s definitely covering up something”.\n\nClaudel managed to include various sensitive topics in his story (child abuse, BLM, human trafficking, migration crisis,…). At first, some of these topics left me a bit unsettled. Mila’s story, for example, left me very confused as to why such a delicate topic (rape/child abuse) was seemingly casually thrown in there for no good reason. I get that they had to find a reason to get back at the teacher, but couldn’t he come up with something else? But then, it got me thinking… There are several instances throughout the story in which sensitive topics had been mentioned and each time Claudel addressed the exact problem (In Mila’s case, the whole island seemed to be aware of the abuse, but everyone turned their heads). Could Claudel maybe be, under a layer of weirdness, addressing some societal problems in Dog Island? I’d like to believe he does.\n\nLove, Elke"
