        "text": "When looking at the archipelago on a map, the group of islands resemble a dog with its mouth open and teeth bared. The sharp pointy islands make up the dog’s teeth. Three bodies washed ashore on one of these islands. Six of the island’s residents discovered the bodies. They didn’t kill them or put them there, but they felt the need to cover it up as if it were a crime. But when an inspector shows up from the mainland, their secrets become harder to keep.\n\nDog Island is the fourteenth novel by the award-winning French novelist, screenwriter, and director Philippe Claudel. It is a suspense story with more twists and snares than a fishing net. Claudel’s descriptions give the reader the sense that the island is rough and its inhabitants more so. The cast of characters are quirky and flawed: a bee-keeping priest who might be an atheist, an inspector who hates everything and everybody, a Dante-reading doctor, and a mayor who will do anything to keep the towns secrets, and more. Dog Island is not only a good suspense novel, it is an insightful look into human nature."
