        "text": "Bradlee Shanks arrived at Dog Island Sunday prepared to endure a Cat-2 hurricane from inside his custom built home. Instead, he found himself face to face with a much more lethal Category 4 Hurricane Michael as it made landfall to the west at Mexico Beach. He survived with very little or no damage\n\nBut his fellow homeowners on the remote island off Carrabelle aren't so lucky, which troubles Shanks.\n\nShanks and the 2,000-square-foot house he designed and built at 813 Gulf Shore Drive sits in the “Mountains” area of the island, the highest point of Dog Island.\n\nBut the devastation in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael is overwhelming. Many of the homes on the beachfront have been destroyed or seriously damaged.\n\nThat includes one beachfront-residence built in 1969 by Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins.\n\nLeRoy Collins III was shaken by the damage to the home that was completed in 1969. He said his grandfather and family members enjoyed the refuge the house provided on the secluded island.\n\nThe simple, two-bedroom home was located on the Gulf side of the island in the “Mountains” area.\n\nAlthough structurally the house is destroyed, Collins said the family is hopeful it can salvage the “beautiful” wide-pine floors his grandparents cherished.\n\n“Having grown up here, like a second home, you realized this could happen,” the 52-year-old investment banker said. “There’s always that risk. It can’t survive a storm like this.”\n\nMore: The Dog Island holdout: USF prof's 'Cat-5' house stands strong against Hurricane Michael\n\nMore: Parts of Apalachicola destroyed by Hurricane Michael\n\nMore: See St. George Island damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael\n\nMore: Hurricane Michael aftermath: Destruction closes portion of U.S. 98\n\nShanks, a professor of art at the University of South Florida, said he’s been spending most of his time getting images of destroyed homes and sharing updates with the owners.\n\nShanks was one of two residents to stay on Dog Island as Hurricane Michael approached.\n\nHis story published online at Tallahassee.com Tuesday prompted a follow-up call and interview with Brian Williams on MSNBC and calls from Don Lemon and Anderson Cooper of CNN.\n\n“I’m ready to get out of here,” Shanks, 60, said Thursday evening. “The destruction out here is really bad. The island has been cut in two.\n\n“The beach out here has been compromised. We lost 5 feet to 6 feet of sand. All of the pilings in the (beachfront) homes have been compromised.”\n\nShanks said the homes on the bayside are in good shape, but he counted nine homes that have been destroyed, and another 20 “that are seriously compromised from an engineering perspective.”\n\nShanks said he and a neighbor, whom he describes as the “island hermit,” have since been joined by Randy and Terri Cannon, the husband-wife team who manage the island.\n\nSome other homeowners have tried to reach the remote island but so far have been unsuccessful.\n\n“It’s just the four of us as far as I know,” Shanks said.\n\nThe force of the storm was powerful, Shanks said, but he didn’t experience any major damage.\n\n“It was vibrating and shaking a little bit, but not much,” he said. “No damage at all, zero. Not even a leaking window. I’m proud.”\n\nIs it time to lower the curtain on his “adventure”?\n\n“Yeah,” he said.\n\nContact senior writer Byron Dobson at bdobson@tallahassee.com or on Twitter @byrondobson."
