Whether slicing foes or ingredients for dinner, the blades of Imugiâs Greatsword & Axe always strike true.Â\n\nPatch 8.11 also brings a new Experimental Gadget: Bubble Bomb, more Esports Items available in Mallhalla, and a new Ranked Map pool. Also starting Friday the 26th, there will be a new Kung Fu Panda Crossover Avatar featuring Zhen and a weekend of discounts on all previous Brawlhalla x Kung Fu Panda Crossover Items!\n\nAll this, plus Bug Fixes, Game Improvements, new rewards for Twitch drops, and so much more!

He was delighted to see his closest companion and brother-in-arms, Jaeyun. He loves to serve his hungriest pals Xull and Mako, though the annual hot dog eating contest was eventually called a draw after running out of hot dogs, buns, and patience.â\n\nNew Skins\n\nShip Sinker Imugi â Rising from the depths of the ocean, he’ll sink your geobukseon!\n\nAxe: Abandoned Anchor\n\nGreatsword: Crowd Control\n\nMecha Imugi â Computer chips with dip and a food processor.\n\nAxe: Ultra Slicer\n\nGreatsword: Super Dragon Star Blade\n\nExoshell Imugi – Bones make for good soup AND armor!
