        "text": "We inspect all preowned items before they are posted to our website and we acknowledge upfront that any items listed here will likely have some signs of usage and/or wear.\n\nWhile we thoroughly inspect all items, there is always a chance they may appear aesthetically non-ideal when shipped, or may be missing some paperwork, inserts or functionality. You are more than welcome to contact us for information on items prior to purchasing and we'll try and give you as much detail on the item as possible.\n\nFor the sake of completion, if the product contains any redemption codes, paperwork or giveaway offers, they are included but are not guaranteed to still be valid. The images shown are provided for visual reference only and may not be the exact item/copy you are receiving, as we often stock multiple copies of the game.\n\nMany games in the post-internet era may have had features that are no longer functional due to services provided by consoles or publishers- we include these details on the page as they were descriptive of the item at the time of release, but can obviously not guarantee that these services are functional still.\n\nSHIPPING POLICY\n\nFree Shipping Promotion:\n\nAll items will be shipped from our store/warehouse within 1-2 business days of order placement, except in some rare cases like warehouse inventories. This item will be shipped Standard or Economy. Here's the reason: we're happy to try and get you the best deal we can, but it still costs us money to send. We may send a TTRPG book or record via media mail if you opt for free shipping. It saves us money, and let's us pay the crew that works here.\n\nThe free shipping policy currently applies to all products, excluding board games, shipped throughout the continental United States and on subtotals over $40.00. This is 100% due to the weight of some of these board games. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nWe're working on expanding the program as we improve our logistical backend.\n\nThis policy may be amended in the future, but hopefully only in a situation when we can make it an even better deal. Our product pricing will hopefully make it worth your time to ship from us, regardless of the slightly increased expense.\n\nWe generally ship USPS, and of course right as we're in the process of launching our website front-end, they changed some details on us and we're working on improving it before we begin. You're more than welcome to contact us for information/explanation.\n\nOn packing materials:\n\nWe believe in doing as little harm as possible and that a box is a box. And that a box is good to place things in. While we do stock several varieties of brand new boxes in order to maximize the ideal fit for the safety of the product(s) you've ordered, we believe that if we have a recycled box that fits the bill with a small tape-rip or old-label residue on it, it's still going to be perfectly useable.\n\nIt may be aesthetically less-than-ideal, but given the number of boxes that major retailers send out- we'd rather not add any more mess to the ballooning waste of the world. And there is no recycling more efficient than a recycled item that needs ZERO processing/reconstruction to make it suit a purpose again.\n\nOn tracking information and order times:\n\nAll items will be shipped from our store/warehouse within 1-2 business days of order placement, except in rare occasions where we'll announce it on a banner at the top of the store) or over holidays where we're unable to hand them off to the shipping service.\n\nBeyond that, we value the work-life balance of our crew, and their mental health- and we will emphasize time-off and not overworking anyone. Major retailers have created an expectation of convenience- and while we love to offer convenience and the best possible customer service, we are not employing hundreds of thousands. It's like 2-3 of us, max, at any time here and we're doing our best.\n\nReceiving tracking information does not guarantee that the item has been handed off to the shipping service, as their pickups are occasionally sporadic. Please contact us if there is any issue with the status of your shipment not updating within 48 hours of receiving the tracking number.\n\nAt this time, our trade-in process only applies to our physical retail store. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nAll customers looking to trade in or sell any items will be required to provide a valid ID and phone number. We assess current sale value, and make an offer based on the current sales data. Quotes and offers will not be honored if a customer leaves the store and returns, and the items in question will need to be re-appraised.\n\nWe will not make any offers or give any quotes on products via email, social media, text, or any other method. Products MUST be in the store (or appraisable by us directly, such as in a storage unit or home, or at a convention) before we're willing to make an offer. If you send us an auction-site listing of your product, or a collection list on a game valuation website, we will likely not buy the items from you- as these sites and situations create an expectation of value that isn't always accurate to the current market data.\n\nPayouts will be made via Cash (discretionary, as there is generally less than $100 in cash in the store at a time) or via PayPal if that cash value threshold is exceeded or if the value of the trade exceeds available cash-on-hand.\n\nWe reserve the right to offer an alternative payout option at our discretion (such as CashApp, Venmo, etc) but will most often MANDATE Cash or PayPal for Business Record-Keeping Requirements. As a general rule, we do not offer store credit for trade-ins. We may opt to, upon request, and only at our discretion."
