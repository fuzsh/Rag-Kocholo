(Click here for the movie’s Facebook page.) This was written and directed by Alice Wang in 2015. (Go here for the article.) Supposedly, this is a story focused on women and their livelihood and the struggles they faced.\n\nPenny’s character was A Qin (阿勤). Her character was both righteous and loyal.\n\nOther female leads in here included Candy Wang (王奕瑾), Lene Lai (賴琳恩), and Francesca Kao (高慧君). The male leads consisted of Duan Jun Hao (段鈞豪) and Wang Xiang Yu (王翔宇).\n\n*All images were collected around the net hence belonging to their rightful owners.\n\nSharing is caring!"
