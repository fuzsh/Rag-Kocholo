The International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms is the one source of information that will draw together all aspects of this exciting and expanding field - a source that will keep you up to date with the latest issues and practice. The International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms publishes original research articles and critical reviews on a broad range of subjects pertaining to medicinal mushrooms, including systematics, nomenclature, taxonomy, morphology, medicinal value, biotechnology, and much more. Papers on new techniques that might promote experimental progress in the aforementioned field are also welcomed. In addition to full-length reports of original research, the journal publishes short communications and interesting case reports, together with literature reviews. Letters to the editor on topics of interest to readers are also published."
