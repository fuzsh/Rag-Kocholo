        "text": "Early life\n\nJasper Liu was born on August 12, 1986 in Taiwan. Youngest of a two child family, he has a sister that is two years older than him. He is also the younger cousin of Angus Hsieh who is best known for The Outsiders drama series, Liu's mother is the younger sister of Hsieh's mother. Liu attended and graduated from Dayeh University where he majored in Visual Design.\n\nLiu's father highly influenced his life. His father was a swimmer and volleyball player in his youth, his healthy and active lifestyle encouraged Liu to workout regularly and body build his physique during his late teens. His father also played the guitar and influenced Liu to take up the instrument himself.\n\nLiu has said one of the reasons he entered show business is because he often felt over shadowed by his father and older sister who both hold higher college degrees than him. Though a fair student, he was never able to best his sister at school and sometimes barely passed his grades. Although his mother would help him cover up his bad grades from his father, he was also never a student that needed to attend tutoring school. He has said that instead of studying for his tests he would spend time in his hobby of drawing or painting.\n\n2010 was one of Liu's lowest and most depressing year in his life. Besides receiving few work offers, his grandmother died, his mother battled breast cancer, his older sister suffered high blood pressure and his pet Pomeranian dog \"ChiChi\" that he'd raised for 17 years (and often referred to as his first girlfriend) died.\n\nThe turning point in his life and the start of his career came in 2011 when he was cast in a minor role in the idol drama In Time with You. Although naturally straight haired he decided to keep the curly permed look of his character \"Mei Nam\" after filming of the drama completed since the curly hair style had become his signature look.\n\n2008-2010: Pre-debut\n\nDuring Liu's senior year in University, he entered the \"2008 Eelin Male Model Search\" contest which he came in 3rd place. Liu's father was highly against him entering showbiz as he was unfamiliar with the entertainment industry, but Liu pleaded with his father to give him a 2-year time period in the industry. He was signed to the agency, but found little success in his first three years as a model earning an average monthly salary of NT$20,000 (estimated USD$658.00). In 2011 his modeling career took off after starring as \"Mei Nam\" in the 2011 idol drama In Time with You where he had to perm his naturally straight hair into short curls. Soon he was known for his signature curly hair which resembled the top of a broccoli head giving him the nickname \"Village Chief of Broccoli Village\" and quickly became a popular male model in demand in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, walking the runways for major fashion designers and appearing in magazines such as FHM, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar Magazine, and GQ.\n\n2011-2012: Acting debut\n\nAfter playing non-credited roles and starring in micro films Liu's big break came in 2011, when he starred in the minor supporting role as \"Mei Nam\" in the popular GTV drama In Time with You, playing a high school classmate to lead actors Ariel Lin and Bolin Chen. His character was known as the handsome male student with curly hair. After recognition and success of In Time with You, Liu decided to keep the curly hair look of his character which would eventually become his signature look in the industry, and continued to play supporting roles in idol dramas, such as 2012's Once Upon a Love in a small cameo role and the teen comedy drama Confucius as one of the rebellious high school students.\n\n2013: The Patisserie with No Name\n\nIt wasn't until 2013 that Liu landed his first male leading role in PTS's critically acclaimed and award nominated drama The Patisserie with No Name as \"Allen\" a stranded backpacker, who accidentally stumbles into a small French pastry shop while trying to recover his stolen belongings and then requesting to stay at the pastry shop by working for room and broad. Also IUUI as a man who falls in love with a girl that was raised like a sibling to his character \"Luo Jia He\".\n\nIn 2014 his popularity crossed over to Japan when he starred as a foreign exchange high school student in one episode of NTV's franchised mystery drama Kindaichi Case Files. Even though Liu knows minor Japanese his voice was eventually dubbed by a Japanese voice actor in the drama.\n\n2014: Pleasantly Surprised and film debut\n\nHis acting career as a leading man continued to rise in 2014 when he signed with Taiwan cable network Sanlih E-Television to star in their dramas. Liu's first project with Sanlih was 2014's SETTV's romantic comedy Pleasantly Surprised, opposite Taiwanese model, singer and actress Puff Kuo. Wanting to go for a more mature look, he cropped off his signature curly hair for his role as \"Louis Fu Zi Jie\", a skilled French chef who returns home, reconnects and falls in love with his childhood friend \"Du Kai Qi\", played by Kuo. Liu and Kuo's chemistry as a screen couple was successful and well received. The two went on to win the \"Best Kiss\" award at the 2014 Sanlih Drama Awards.\n\nThat same year, two of Liu's theatrical films that were filmed in 2013 were released in theaters. In October 2014, Live@Love in which he stars in his first leading role in a theatrical film, co-stars Cheryl Yang whom he previous worked with in 2012 GTV television drama Once Upon a Love playing an older version of her son. The film is a mystery detective comedy with Liu playing Yang's young assistant. Then in November 2014, Second Chance has him in a supporting role starring opposite Taiwanese band Mayday's leader and guitarist Monster. The movie is about a young girl played by Peijia Huang, who enters a billiards competition in order to pay off her family debt. Liu plays the love interest of Peijia Huang's character.\n\n2015: Ghostly role and When I See You Again\n\nThe day after Pleasantly Surprised wrapped up filming, Liu attended a press conference on October 14, 2014, for his new drama I Am Sorry, I Love You that is being developed and produced by Chinese web streaming company Tudou. The drama has been described as a light-hearted fantasy romance comedy. Liu will play a ghost who continues to haunt his college ex-girlfriend played by Andrea Chen, and possibly help her move on and find a new romance played by Bryant Chang. Filming was scheduled to begin in November 2014. The drama is slated to air in early 2015. After wrapping up filming of My Ghost Friend in March, Liu took a few months off before starting his next project. In early May 2015 he collaborated with Sanlih for a second time starring in their Sunday night drama When I See You Again opposite Mandy Wei. He will play a unattractive guy during his school days who later becomes handsome.\n\n2016-present: First Fanmeeting\n\nFollowing after a successful Live Tour across Taiwan with his band, Morning Call in the year-end of 2015, the first half of 2016 was a quiet period for Liu. His supposedly first period Chinese Wuxia drama 王道劍 was constantly delayed even though it was slated to start filming early 2016. Bounded by his contracts and to avoid possible conflicting schedules, he could not take up other film works during this period of time. In between, he only took shorter projects such as filming endorsement CF works and dubbing for his first voice acting project for \"Chibi Maruko-chan: Italia Kara Kita Shōnen\" as the male lead, Andrea. Despite going through a relatively quiet period, his positive image and rising popularity is still prominent in Taiwan as he lands on several endorsements like Visa Taiwan Debit Card and appointed as the ambassador for various charity events.\n\nAfter months of hiatus from filming, he finally took on the role of a hot-tempered and talented Indie band vocalist, \"Rex\" in web-series \"迷徒Chloe\", starring along with acclaimed actor Chris Wu and actress Nana Lee. The series revolves around the love and life of titular lead, \"Chloe\", a career-women played by Lee. Liu plays the love interest and new boyfriend of \"Chloe\" in the series. This role was a great new challenge for Liu as the role requires him to sing, he was known to be the guitarist in his band, Morning Call and have never officially sing a full song on screen. The role \"Rex\" is very hot-tempered and brash, vastly different from the warmer roles he took in the past.\n\nCollaborating with Korea's travel website, Nadoyo, his career took off to another level by holding his first ever Fanmeeting in Seoul, South Korea on July 31st. According to news reports, 500 tickets were sold out in 10 minutes and hundreds of Korean fans greeted him in the airport, proving his popularity in South Korea. He was awarded with Asian Male Star Prize at 11th Seoul Drama Awards in September.\n\nIn September, filming starts for the nostalgia high school music romance movie, Take Me to The Moon (帶我去月球), starring as a high school student, \"Wang Zheng Xiang\", the male lead opposite of actress Vivian Sung. The movie is inspired by the same-title song by late popular Taiwanese singer-songwriter Chang Yu Sheng. Set in 1997 Taiwan, the movie revolves around a group of high school schoolmates, the \"Moon Band\" and the last few nights before their graduation day. It is slated to be released in Summer 2017.\n\nMusic\n\nWhen not modeling or acting Liu is the guitarist for popular Taiwanese indie band Morning Call. The group writes and produces their own songs. The group has not released any albums but self produced limited copies of their music is available. The group often tours in small music venues around Asia.

In fact he still lives with his parents in his childhood home in Taipei. He also enjoys traveling and going on vacations with his parents during his time off.\n\nBesides writing and creating music, Liu's other hobbies are oil painting.
