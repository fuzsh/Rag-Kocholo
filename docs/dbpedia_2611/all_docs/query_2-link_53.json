        "text": "You may have noticed several recent reviews of Japanese books from Amazon Crossing, all three by Shion Miura, but those actually came about after I was asked to take a look at an upcoming Korean release (out in September). It‚Äôs by a writer whose work I‚Äôve tried once before, many moons ago, so I was interested to see what the latest one was all about. A big success in Korea, today‚Äôs choice is a story about a man at the height of his fame who is suddenly cut down to size, and about the summer long ago that‚Äôs at the heart of it all ‚Äì let‚Äôs take a look, shall we?\n\n*****\n\nBroken Summer (translated by An Seon Jae) is the story of Lee Hanjo, a famous painter who‚Äôs enjoying a perfect day to celebrate his forty-third birthday. After spending it with his beautiful wife, he has a few drinks to finish the day off before falling into a deep sleep. However, when he wakes up the next day, his wife‚Äôs gone, leaving no trace except for some pages from a book she appears to have written, pages that send Hanjo‚Äôs heart racing.\n\nWe then go back a few decades to Hanjo‚Äôs youth to find out about his life in an old house, and about the rich family who move into the mansion just up the hill. The two families soon develop close ties, based both on friendship and subservience (both of Hanjo‚Äôs parents work for the new family); until, that is, the elder daughter disappears, and is eventually found dead in a nearby reservoir. The main suspects appear to be Hanjo, his elder brother Suin and their father, but who really killed Jisoo, and just what does it have to do with what happens on Hanjo‚Äôs birthday many years later?\n\nBroken Summer is the work of J.M. Lee, AKA Jung-Myung Lee, and back in 2015, I read his novel The Investigation, which was longlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize (the forerunner of the current International Booker Prize). It was an attempt at a literary thriller, and that‚Äôs very much the aim here, too. The later work is a novel that jumps back and forth in time, showing how Hanjo‚Äôs life is turned upside down by his wife, while also looking at his childhood and recreating what happened in the time leading up to the young woman‚Äôs death.\n\nThis involves an examination of Korean society that will be rather familiar to anyone who has watched dramas or movies from the country. We have the two families, one rich, one poor, closely connected yet also kept at a slight distance because of their respective statuses. There are clear parallels here with the movie Parasite, and further echoes of that film come later on when Hanjo and his brother are living in Seoul:\n\nAfter living for a month in the students‚Äô study room, the brothers secured a semiunderground room with mold on the walls. At night, they huddled together in the cold room without light and cursed the darkness that kept them locked in. Softly, they told themselves that this was the price they had to pay to become better people.\n\npp.99/100 (Amazon Crossing, 2022)\n\nYes, it‚Äôs the familiar trope of poor people suffering and putting up with great hardship to make a life for themselves.\n\nAnother common K-Soc trope centres on the police investigation. Lee shows how in Korea the public can make demands of their officials and representatives, with the media also hounding the police and putting them under pressure:\n\n‚ÄúWhether we like it or not, the incident has now gone beyond being just an incident. Citizens are calling for a killer to be caught, and the media are ahead of us in looking for a killer. What happens if we classify the death of a leading politician‚Äôs innocent daughter as suicide when everyone is watching? People will think that we‚Äôre incompetent police officers who can‚Äôt catch a murderer and are blaming the victim to avoid responsibility.‚Äù (p.67)\n\nWhile the police start off looking for the killer, eventually they‚Äôre simply looking for a killer, which means that when someone confesses, they‚Äôre not all that fussed about checking whether they really have caught the criminal, or whether they‚Äôve just pulled someone in to make their lives easier‚Ä¶\n\nThe driving force of Broken Summer comes from the novel Hanjo‚Äôs wife has written, a book the painter knows will destroy his life if it‚Äôs published, even if she claims it‚Äôs all fiction. Quite apart from his worries about public reaction, however, there‚Äôs also the small matter of why his wife, for some reason, suddenly wants to punish her husband, making use of public opinion to destroy his life. It‚Äôs a fair question, but answering it would rather spoil the book, so I‚Äôll leave you to make your own guesses here üòâ\n\nSome of the best parts of the novel feature the characterisation of Hanjo, with Lee slowly showing us just what kind of a person he is. A successful artist, yes, but he‚Äôs a rather weak man, overly reliant on his wife, who actually made him a success. With no self-confidence and a tendency to drink to excess, he‚Äôs not a bad man as such, but he‚Äôs liable to make major mistakes at times, and is prone to crumbling at the slightest set-back. It‚Äôs easy to imagine, then, how he reacts when his wife drops the big bombshell.\n\nBroken Summer is an interesting story in parts, but if I‚Äôm honest, it never really grabbed me. There are too many rather predictable developments, which means it doesn‚Äôt really succeed as a tightly plotted thriller. In fact, in going for both a mystery and a literary book, Lee fails to nail either genre, the end result falling between two stools.\n\nOne issue is that the writing feels especially clumsy at times, with an emphasis on blunt telling rather than showing for the most part. It‚Äôs often hard to care about many of the rather two-dimensional characters, as much as the writer might try to make us understand them:\n\nAfter the inquiry, reporters gathered outside the shipping container. The detectives looked trustworthy in front of the cameras, like actors onstage. Kang‚Äôs expression, which seemed to be inspired by cheap action movies, was dignified. (p.45)\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot more where this came from, meaning the book often lends itself to skim-reading rather than any great engagement with the text.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs interesting in parts, with a nice (if slightly unearned) twist at the end, Broken Summer isn‚Äôt really a book I‚Äôd normally pick up, but it might appeal to those looking for an easy, quick, thriller read. It‚Äôs a story of how our mistakes have a way of catching up with us sooner or late, with no secret safe enough to stay hidden for ever. As poor Hanjo learns, even those closest to you can‚Äôt always be trusted ‚Äì it‚Äôs best to make sure you don‚Äôt have any skeletons in your closet‚Ä¶"
