        "text": "“Two people will not be better than one, so that’s why I like being alone” has always been a belief that Du Kai Qi (Puff Guo) has absolute certainty in. Kai Qi is an independent, single woman who enjoys the lifestyle of being alone working as a sous chef at the fine-dining restaurant, Figaro Cuisine. It doesn’t matter how her mother persuades her otherwise she just won’t budge. She is unlike most girls who is cry and laugh for love but instead for most of the time, she is calm and cool-headed. Due to her belief, no man will be more important than her mother. When two people are together, she will have to worry about his feelings and accommodate to him so why bother? Continue reading →\n\nNow that the every so beautiful drama In A Good Way is over and out, it is time for Love Myself or You to take over its timeslot. Starring Puff Guo of Dream Girls, Liu Yi Hao/Jasper Liu, Lee Shao Xiang/Sean Lee and Lene Lai, LMOY is reverting back to the typical idol-drama territory but at least this one seems like it is going to work unlike the Sunday night idol drama Fall in Love with Me starring fellow Dream Girls member Tia Li and Aaron Yan. That drama is just plot-less and chemistry-less and I really do not know what I am even watching it save for the occasional naked Aaron scenes. LMOY, on the other hand, seems to have a much more interesting premises and there is actually a plot to it.\n\nSETTV idol dramas are known to have the word “love” in their titles and it continues that route with this drama. However, the Chinese title extends to a much deeper meaning that I feel is sort of lost with the English title. It’s Chinese title is 喜歡‧一個人 which can be interpreting in several ways. Its literal title is “Like. One Person” which can be seen as either to like a person (i.e. “Like A Person”) or to like alone (i.e. “Like. Alone”). It’s very creative and what’s better is that it really fits in with plot. Puff’s character is a sous chef who enjoys a solidarity life where she can fixate on food whether that be cooking it or eating it and reading manga. Jasper’s character then enters her life and she can’t help but fall for him. So I guess the title reflects how the drama is going to play out, which is pretty neat if you ask me. Continue reading →"
