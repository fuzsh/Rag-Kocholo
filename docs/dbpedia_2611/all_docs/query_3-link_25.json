        "text": "This is one of the better final endings I’ve seen for a Taiwanese drama, in that the resolution for the conflict is left for the final episode and everything else is tied up nicely.\n\nWe are taking a step back in the plotting stuffz but I love spending time with the good old couple anyway!\n\nI quite enjoyed this episode although there was a tad too much plotting for my liking, but for the first time, I actually found myself wishing that there was more and I didn’t have to wait until next week to find out what happens.\n\nDidn’t enjoy this episode quite as much as the last, but what I surprisingly do enjoy is that I now have feelings about Zi Yu…Feelings of dislike yes, but at least I feel something about this character.\n\nI really enjoy watching this episode! Finally our couple has come together and even has few ground rules set. I like their dynamics because it is just like how a normal couple would behave!"
