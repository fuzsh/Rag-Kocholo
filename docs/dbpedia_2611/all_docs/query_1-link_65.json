        "text": "sexual violence and sexual threat\n\nThere is a scene of sexual assault where a young woman is grabbed by a male neighbour whilst opening her front door. The two struggle as he grabs her breasts from behind before she eventually gets free and pushes him down a flight of stairs.\n\ntheme\n\nAfter being mocked because of her weight, a woman starves herself and compulsively exercises in order to lose weight. A character with bulimia is seen making himself sick but the film does not promote or encourage such behaviour. A woman coughs up food after overeating after gastric bypass surgery.\n\nThere are scenes of transphobic behaviour where the mother of a schoolchild pulls them off stage during a performance embarrassed they are wearing a wig, makeup and dress. The mother later has a verbal altercation with school staff and expresses her desire for her child to be normal. This mother's behaviour is clearly condemned by other characters who encourage the child's self-expression and confront her intolerance. There are also references to the mother taking the child to see many doctors about their 'cross-dressing' behaviour. There are frequent moments of discrimination where a young woman is berated by people about her weight and experiences microaggressions towards her size. There is a dream sequence with moderate violence where two women wrestle, punch and slam each others heads against the interior of a human stomach. One of the woman is seen with blood on her face. Moderate injury detail occurs when a woman accidently cuts her hand after a child knocks her into a kitchen counter."
