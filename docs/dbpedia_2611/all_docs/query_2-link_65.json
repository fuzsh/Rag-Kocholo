At the end of the procession are two academics/staff with ceremonial torches who on stage bow to each other, the rows of academics/staff, and then place the torches on a small, raised table with a cloth at the very front of the stage.]\n\n(A video of Chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, starts playing on the large screens above the auditorium.)\n\nChancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar:\n\nGreetings all. I am the chancellor of the University of Sussex. A lot of you probably already knew that, but um, I thought the beard might throw you. It's for a character I'm playing in a TV thing. It is real! If I'd been there, I would've invited you to give it a tug to check its authenticity as you cross the stage - or not. Anyway, I digress.Well, well here we are. Well, here you are. I am of course somewhere else, but here in spirit and in admiration. Apologies for gate-crashing your day, but I just couldn't help crowbarring myself into your celebration. I wanted to add the warmest of welcomes to all of you, graduands, families and friends and to those like me who may be following the ceremony remotely. Sussex graduations have become known for being a festival, a bit of a party, and it's a tradition that I hope you'll continue today.This is your day, so express your joy and positivity when you cross the stage. And friends and family, this is your day too, so take a moment to be prepared with your cameras for the moment your superstar crosses the stage and make as much noise as you can when they do.Oh, come on, they've embarrassed you enough times in the past. So this is payback time.Have a great ceremony and I'll catch you on the other side.\n\n[Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sasha Roseneil, stands and approaches the lectern to make an introductory speech.]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nMr. Mayor, distinguished guests, colleagues, members of the university, parents, supporters, friends, and above all our graduands, the Sussex class of 2024.\n\nIt's my great honour and enormous pleasure to welcome you here today to the Brighton Centre.\n\nI'm Professor Sasha Roseneil and I'm the vice-chancellor and president of the University of Sussex.\n\nGraduands, as our chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar has just reminded us, today is all about you. It's a day of celebration for you and of you and of all that you've achieved during your time at Sussex. It's also a moment to acknowledge that many of you have benefited in countless tangible and less tangible ways from the love and support of your family or guardians and carers. From the encouragement of your friends and of course from the teaching and guidance of staff at the university. You may also have had support from our alumni community and donors, who've generously provided scholarships that have enabled some of you to study at Sussex. So I'm now going to ask for a little participation from you. Our graduands, if you're able, would you please stand up and turn and face the audience, your friends and loved ones? Please stand and turn around, and offer your thanks with a big hearty cheer and a round of applause.\n\n(Graduands stand and give a big round of applause.)\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil continues:\n\nThank you. You are very appreciative.\n\nSo as a university, at Sussex we're committed to providing an inclusive and respectful and supportive environment for every member of our diverse and international community. And that extends to our celebrations today. This is an important event not only in the lives of our graduands, but for everyone in the auditorium, some of whom have travelled a very long way to be with us.\n\nSussex students represent the most wonderful variety of backgrounds, beliefs, and identities. You come each year from over 130 countries around the world. So we have people in the audience today of many different nationalities and faiths. Amongst everyone gathered here, there's a huge diversity of opinion and belief about almost every matter under the sun. And that diversity of thought and belief is a very special thing, something that Sussex as a university seeks always to uphold and support. We have a foundational commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom, and it's our job as a university to create an environment in which diversity of belief and opinion can be explored. It's our job to nurture the conditions under which our students and staff can respectfully discuss and debate difficult ideas where propositions can be tested, analysis undertaken, theories developed, and where minds can be expanded and changed.\n\nWe are living in deeply troubled times with war and conflict, terror, death and the destruction of habitats, economic hardship, hunger and inequality, as well as the climate crisis and environmental degradation, giving rise to enormous concern amongst Sussex students. Many Sussex students and their families and loved ones, I'm sure, hold passionate opinions about the causes, consequences and solutions to these issues. And as we gather here today to celebrate graduation, I'd like to emphasise that the university supports and will always support freedom of expression that is lawful and respectful of others, mindful of the humanity and diversity that's at the heart of our university community and that's what binds us together across nations and faiths, as a global community.\n\nSo Sussex graduands, I'd like to thank you for all that you have contributed to making our university a place of community, inclusion and diversity. An open, warm and welcoming place. In the two years since I became vice-chancellor, I've come to realise that Sussex students are the very embodiment of energy, hope, and possibility. Alongside your academic work, many of you have taken part in an impressive range of other activities as members and leaders of student societies and groups and as volunteers, helping and supporting other people on and off campus. Many of you are today receiving a Spirit of Sussex Award for your positive contributions to our community. From serving as campus ambassadors to fundraising for local causes to creating new ways for our campus to be more environmentally sustainable.\n\nI commend your commitment to your extracurricular activities. Well done on all you've achieved alongside your formal studies.\n\nOver the past two years, I've had the great privilege of meeting many Sussex alumni, not just in the UK, but from across the world in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. I've been overwhelmed by how many of them told me how much they'd loved their days at Sussex and how the experience of studying at Sussex had fundamentally shaped their lives and careers. They record encountering new ideas and ways of thinking that transformed their worldview, as well as making lasting friendships and building networks that have accompanied them ever since. I sincerely hope that you, today's graduands, will feel the same in the years to come.\n\nWhether you already have a job or are taking time to explore the world or are looking for your next opportunity, you can be confident that you're leaving a university with a global reputation. A university that has equipped you with knowledge and skills to think critically and creatively. To work across the boundaries of established knowledge and to understand the importance of a global perspective. You've been tutored and supervised by academics who are internationally recognised for the quality of their research and scholarship. The breadth and depth of their research has directly informed your education. Across the disciplines and in the spaces in between, our research focuses on the urgent concerns of the time.\n\nSome of you may have seen our 'Impossible Until it's Done' Banners around Brighton and Hove and on the buses that bring you to campus. Inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela, this campaign highlights the work we're doing to tackle pollution in rivers, to find new ways, to treat dementia, and to tackle young people's mental health. We know that the great value of our research resides in sharing its successes and its impact across the world, and we have much to celebrate in this respect. For the eighth consecutive year with our campus partner, the Institute for Development Studies, we've been ranked first in the world for Development Studies. This is an outstanding achievement by our academics. Not many British universities can lay claim to being first in the world in a subject area. The development studies which seek an understandings of and progress towards global equity, social justice and sustainability is very much what Sussex is about. One of the key measures of the strength and the impact of a university is the extent to which the publications of its researchers are cited by other researchers. Sussex really does punch above our weight in many areas in this respect. This year in the QS World University Rankings, we have nine subject areas in the top 10 in the UK for citations with two subject areas; History and Physics and Astronomy, each ranked first in the UK. We've also been recognised as the eighth most sustainable university in the UK and joint 26th in the world, which shows just how much we are contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. All this means that Sussex research is improving the lives of individuals and communities around the world, enhancing and advancing developments in technology, influencing the policies of governments, as well as making a positive difference to the protection and regeneration of our natural environment.\n\nNow I know that many of you graduating today have already had extraordinary and sometimes difficult life journeys. All of you have lived through the COVID-19 pandemic and the enormous disruption that this caused to your lives and education. Some of you have struggled with your mental health, some of you with your physical health, some of you have faced loss and family disruption during your student days. Each of you has had a unique journey to Sussex and through your time at Sussex and each of you will have had ups and downs. But whatever your Sussex story, I hope that when you look back at the time you've been with us, you feel that your studies were intellectually challenging and rigorous, that you were stretched, stimulated, and supported to achieve your best. That you're leaving with knowledge, skills, and personal resources that will stand you in good stead and that you made connections and friendships that will stay with you long into the future. You'll now take many different paths as you join our community of more than 200,000 alumni around the world. Sussex alumni include Nobel laureates, grassroots campaigners and activists, heads of state and vice presidents, leaders, influencers and creative practitioners in the arts and entertainment, writers, journalists and academics, chief executives of national and multinational organisations, and many with less high-profile but no less significant lives and careers. People whose actions and relationships are remaking and renewing the social fabric in small positive ways every day. Across the globe, in more than 160 countries and in all walks of life, our alumni are sharing the benefits of their Sussex experience to make the world a better place. And I know you will do that too.\n\nSo, graduands, celebrate who you are today. Celebrate the commitment you made to achieve your degree. Celebrate the fact that the sacrifices you made were worth it. Celebrate the belief in yourself that made it possible and celebrate those who helped you reach this point in your journey. In short, celebrate.\n\nI now call upon the Head of the School of Life Sciences, Professor Michelle West.\n\n(Graduands and guests applaud.)\n\n[ Head of the School of Life Sciences, Professor Michelle West, stands and approaches the lectern to present the graduands.

Professor West bows to Isabella Tree. They shake hands, and both move to the centre of the platform. Professor Michelle Westret returns to the lectern to deliver her oration.]\n\nProfessor Michelle West:\n\nIsabella Tree began her career as a travel writer and has authored several books. She has received numerous awards for her writing, including the Zoological Society of London, Silver Medal and the Travelex, Travel Writers Award. However, she is best known for the co-creation of the NEP Wildlands project with her husband Charlie Burle. Biodiversity is in decline at a global and national scale, but their rewilding project, which began in 2000, has demonstrated that this is not irreversible. Wildlife can recover swiftly with just a little help from us.\n\nAfter years of trying to keep a failing farm going, Isabella and Charlie began an experiment to turn their 1,400-hectare estate over to nature. 24 years on it teams with life of all kinds. From Purple Emperor butterflies to Nightingales and Turtle Doves. Tens of thousands of people flock NEP in West Sussex each year to reconnect with nature to see the herds of Deer, Exmoor Ponies, Old English Longhorn Cattle and Tamworth pigs roaming free to be amazed by the stalk, soaring overhead, and perhaps be lucky enough to glimpse one of the Beavers reintroduced to Sussex 400 years after they were hunted to extinction. But the experiment also serves an important purpose for research. Scientists, including those from the University of Sussex, are among those studying how restoring natural landscapes revitalises our flora and fauna and our soil. For many years, our undergraduates and postgraduates have taken part in field trips and carried out projects at NEP from studying the grazing habits of large herbivores to monitoring biodiversity from sound recordings to counting Dung beetles - a keystone species for wildlife. Students say they are excited to be involved in the projects, knowing the data they are collecting is contributing to important studies. NEP was mentioned in the UK Government's 25-year Environment Plan as an outstanding example of landscape restoration in recovering nature.\n\nThe project has inspired dozens of other Rewilding projects around the UK and beyond. Isabella has played a vital role in popularising, the approach through her book; \"Wilding: The Return of Nature to a British Farm\" and now a visually stunning documentary currently wowing cinema audiences. She's also written two illustrated fiction books for children; \"When We Went Wild\" and \"When the Storks Came Home\" which vitally introduced children to the idea of rewilding. In 2023, she published the bestselling, \"The Book of Wilding: A Practical Guide to Rewilding, Big and Small\" This book explains that you do not need a huge estate to get involved in rewilding. The same principles can be applied on a small scale in a garden or even a window box. One way or another, every single one of us can contribute to making our land a little wilder. Through the NEP project, Isabella Tree has helped to inspire and empower a new generation of conservationists, offering hope and a way forward at a time when it is desperately needed.\n\nVice-Chancellor, I present to you for the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, Isabella Tree.\n\n[Applause]\n\n[Professor Sasha Roseneil stands and shakes hands with Isabella Tree]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nBy the authority of the Senate of the University, I confer on you the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa.\n\n[Doctor of Science, honoris causa Isabella Tree goes to the lectern to deliver her speech.]\n\nDoctor of Science, Isabella Tree:\n\nVice Chancellor, thank you for dressing me like a banana, but what an unbelievable honour.\n\nI've stood on many stages over the last 10 years and on most occasions, I felt that monster, the imposter syndrome making faces behind me, but never quite like this. A Doctor of Science.\n\nI have to go a long way back to remember when I was a bona fide student of Science to St. Mary's Convent in Sister Daniel's O-level Chemistry class. Yes. Before GCSEs Sister Daniel and I parted ways when I triggered a volcanic meltdown on the wooden bench in the lab by mixing the one substance we were told not to let touch another. I was assigned to classics where the nuns thought Latin and Greek might rain in my exuberance. I thought Latin was deadly until a friend of my parents, the armed forces minister who'd had a similarly depressing time with Latin at school, taught me the phrase; \"Hoc pro ludo militum\" - Fuck that for a game of soldiers, and that a roast sausage is a \"pistùn caro\". Who knew?!\n\nMy interest in classics rocketed and I decided to take it on to university at Royal Holloway College London. There I learned another of life's greatest mantras; \"Inex Omnes sumus, Solum profunditas, variate\" - We are all in the shit. It's only the depth that differs.\n\nSo I guess the little that I bring to science is a love of Latin names and the enthusiasm of an absolute beginner.\n\nScience has played a huge role in establishing the credibility of NEP, our Rewilding project, just 40 minutes from here. It's proved that wildlife has massively increased since we started 25 years ago and identified the many rare species now breeding there. This is thanks to the work of people, way more qualified than me, NEPs own ecologists and students from a dozen universities including the University of Sussex. Some of you here today may have done fieldwork at NEP under the tutorage of two of your brilliant lecturers, Dave Goulson and Chris Sandem. My own daughter Nancy is doing fieldwork at NEP for her PhD at Oxford. She's proving that Rewilding is not only good for biodiversity, it can help solve the climate crisis too. Hers will be the doctorate in the family that is 24 karat gold.\n\nBut what I take away with this wonderful and unexpected and in so many ways, undeserved honour, is the power of communication. How translating the science that has been done at NEP by writing and talking about it, has reached a wider audience. In the same way, whether you've been studying the arts or sciences, your knowledge and your ideas will change the world and move it on. Communicating those ideas so that everyone can understand them from those around you to potential employers and eventually employees is key. AI will be an incredible help. None of us should feel guilty about using it. We all now have our own personal assistant, but we need to keep our integrity and to use our voice in creative ways that open rather than close channels of communication with others, especially those working in different fields or bubbles than our own. We need to keep the beginners' mind.\n\nI wish everyone graduating today, all the luck in the world for the exciting influential lives that lie ahead of you.

She was excited about her second-year modules and was looking into internships and voluntary placements in organisations that would give her real-world experience in the field of conservation, demonstrating a clear commitment to making a difference to the world we live in.\n\nWe remember Sefia as a very dedicated member of her class, always ready to show support and kindness to others. One of her lecturers recalls a particular occasion where after a statistics class where Sefia stayed behind, opened her laptop and patiently explained a calculation to a classmate who was finding the work challenging.\n\nWe are honoured to have Sefia's family here with us today to commemorate her achievements in her degree, alongside her student cohort, friends and their families. While we mourn her loss deeply, we celebrate the mark that she left on Sussex and acknowledge what it means to us that she was part of our community.\n\nVice-chancellor, today we honour in a small way Sefia's achievement by awarding her a degree of Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Conservation. Sefia's family are here today to receive her certificate.\n\n[Sefia’s family members shake hands with Michelle West and the Vice-Chancellor then walk to the other side of the stage and collect the certificate from the marshal.]\n\n[Applause]\n\nProfessor Michelle West:\n\nVice-chancellor, This concludes the list of graduands from the School of Life Sciences.\n\n[Provost, Professor Michael Luck, stands and approaches the lectern to present the graduands.

You are now graduates of the University of Sussex.\n\n[Cheer and applause]\n\nI now declare this ceremony closed.\n\n(Graduates and academics/staff stand and after sustained applause, a final video of Chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, starts playing on the large screens above the auditorium.)\n\nChancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar:\n\nHello, it's me again. Congratulations graduates. Very, very well done to all of you. Traditionally, the chancellor is supposed to leave you with some parting words of wisdom. I don't think there's anything I can tell you that you don't instinctively already know, and your instincts that inner voice, are always right by the way. But they speak with the same vocabulary, cadence, inflexion, and grammar as your fears, anxieties, and doubts. So how to tell the difference? Your instincts always come from a place of love. So check in with yourself and make sure that you are always coming from a place of kindness towards yourself and the world around you. Being kind in every situation can be a challenge sometimes. I know it's easier said than done, but the more you practice it, the easier it gets until eventually it's just habit and a part of who you are. You have all achieved magnificently in your academic pursuit and I have no doubt you will apply that to your journey going forward. For dealing with the emotional challenges, anxiety and mental health issues that we all face in an uncertain world we need emotional intelligence. I believe that at the heart of emotional intelligence is compassion, love, and positivity. You know how when we look up at a clear night sky, we can marvel at starlight knowing that those stars may not now even exist yet we can bask in their glow. Love and compassion have the same power. We can and do feel love and kindness from people and events long since gone, and we can do that now for those who will be here when we've long since gone. An act of compassion is like dropping a pebble into a lake. The ripples affect far more and reaches way further than we ever thought or intended. Positivity is not about thinking everything is great all the time. It's being aware that things are tough, but believing and knowing that that is not permanent, that things can and will change. I've lived this experience at 32. I was unemployed, in debt and living with my parents. I could not conceive that within two years I'd be working on TV and movies and not what my business degree had planned for me. Going further, back at 18, I applied here to Sussex, my first choice for university. I didn't get in... something about my grades not being good enough... so I went elsewhere and waited until all those responsible for me not to getting in, had retired, were in prison, deported, or were just playing dead. And at the age of 46, I came back here as chancellor. So ha ha, ha ha! And going back even further, still, when I was five years old, an uncle asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, Actor -I said. My father said; \"It's pronounced doctor.\" But 30 years later, and since I've been living and doing what I dreamed of, obviously, I'm someone who plays the long game. My point is that all of those moments have been amongst the most surprising, positive experiences of my life and have led to other extraordinary experiences including bringing me here today, thus obliterating, all of the negative ones I had before. It taught me that I have no idea exactly what's in my future, and neither do you. But you want to stay in the game until the good stuff comes around and be ready for it when it does. One of my favourite quotes is from the great American poet, Maya Angelou, who I was lucky to have met once, and she said; \"People may forget what you did. People may forget what you said. People will never forget the way you made them feel.\" The final key to emotional intelligence, I wanna mention, is listening and talking. It's obvious, right? Listening. Really hearing what someone is saying to you is essential. People aren't always consciously saying what they're feeling, so like a detective waiting for that vital piece of information, you have to be really on it. My aunt always used to say; you have two ears and one mouth. So always listen twice as much as you talk. And talking, when we're overwhelmed by anything, fear, anger, grief, greed, even beauty and love, the thing we lose is perspective even momentarily and in those moments, we may act in haste and without the clarity that's required. The quickest way to perspective is to pause and then talk to someone. Get an alternative point of view that's not also been created in your own head. But choose wisely beforehand 'cause these will be the excellent listeners I mentioned and will not necessarily be convenient, but will tell you their honest opinion in the most compassionate way. And if you can't find someone to talk to, get yourself a sense of humour. If you can see that, that overwhelming, terrifying thing is also silly then it is no longer just a terrifying thing. Instant perspective. Mahatma Gandhi said; Be the change you want to see in the world. So if you want to see a more compassionate world, you be more compassionate. You wanna see more accountability, then you be more accountable. I hope we meet in person at some point, in which case, feel free to come up and say, I'm a Sussex graduate and you owe me a hug or a handshake or a high five! Or ignore me if you want. It's up to you. Either way, I wish you all success in everything you do next. Take your compassion, positivity, humour, and power and change your world. Someone's world. The world.\n\n[Music playing] (Senior academics and staff on stage tip their hats as two academics/staff walk across the stage to pick up the ceremonial torches from the small, raised table.

I am the chancellor of the University of Sussex. A lot of you probably already knew that, but um, I thought the beard might throw you. It's for a character I'm playing in a TV thing. It is real! If I'd been there, I would've invited you to give it a tug to check its authenticity as you cross the stage - or not. Anyway, I digress.Well, well here we are. Well, here you are. I am of course somewhere else, but here in spirit and in admiration. Apologies for gate-crashing your day, but I just couldn't help crowbarring myself into your celebration. I wanted to add the warmest of welcomes to all of you, graduands, families and friends and to those like me who may be following the ceremony remotely. Sussex graduations have become known for being a festival, a bit of a party, and it's a tradition that I hope you'll continue today.This is your day, so express your joy and positivity when you cross the stage. And friends and family, this is your day too, so take a moment to be prepared with your cameras for the moment your superstar crosses the stage and make as much noise as you can when they do.Oh, come on, they've embarrassed you enough times in the past. So this is payback time.Have a great ceremony and I'll catch you on the other side.\n\n[Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sasha Roseneil, stands and approaches the lectern to make an introductory speech.]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nMr. Mayor, distinguished guests, colleagues, parents, supporters, friends, and above all our graduands, the Sussex class of 2024. It's my great honour and enormous pleasure to welcome you to the Brighton Centre for this graduation ceremony.\n\nI'm Professor Sasha Roseneil and I'm the vice-chancellor and president of the University of Sussex. Graduands, as our chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar has just reminded us, today is all about you. This is a day of celebration for you and of you and of all that you've achieved during your time at Sussex. It's also a moment to acknowledge that many of you have benefited in countless, tangible and less tangible ways from the love and support of your family or guardians and carers. From the encouragement of your friends and of course from the teaching and guidance of staff at the university. You may also have had support from our alumni and donors who've generously provided scholarships that have enabled you to study at Sussex. So I'm now going to ask for some participation from you.\n\nGraduands, if you're able, would you please stand up and turn to face the audience, your friends and loved ones? I invite you to offer your thanks with a big hearty cheer and a round of applause.\n\n(Graduands stand and give a big round of applause.)\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil continues:\n\nNow please be seated again.\n\nAs a university, we at Sussex are committed to providing an inclusive, respectful, and supportive environment for every member of our diverse and international community. And that extends to our celebrations today. This is an important event, not only in the lives of our graduands, but for everyone in this auditorium. Some who've travelled a very long way to be with us.\n\nSussex students represent the most wonderful variety of backgrounds, beliefs, and identities. You come each year from over 130 countries around the world. So we have people in the audience today of many different nationalities and faiths and amongst everyone gathered here, there is huge diversity of opinion and belief about almost every matter under the sun. And that diversity of thought and belief is a very special thing, something that Sussex as a university seeks always to uphold and support. We have a foundational commitment to freedom of speech and to academic freedom. It's our job as a university to create an environment in which diversity of beliefs and opinion can be explored. It's our job to nurture the conditions under which our students and staff can respectfully discuss and debate difficult ideas where propositions can be tested, analysis undertaken, theories developed, and where minds can be expanded and changed. We are living in deeply troubled times with war and conflict, terror, death, and the destruction of habitats, economic hardship, hunger and inequality, as well as climate crisis and environmental degradation, giving rise to enormous concern amongst Sussex students. Many Sussex students and their parents and loved ones, I'm sure, hold passionate opinions about the causes, consequences and solutions to these issues. As we gather here today to celebrate graduation, I'd like to emphasise that the university supports and will always support freedom of expression that is lawful and respectful of others. Mindful of the humanity and diversity that's at the heart of our university community. And that binds us together across nations and faiths as a global community.\n\nSo Sussex graduands, I would like to thank you all of you for all that you've contributed to making our university a place of community, inclusion and diversity, an open, warm and welcoming place. In the two years since I became vice-chancellor, I've come to realise that Sussex students are the very embodiment of energy, hope, and possibility alongside your academic work. Many of you have taken part in an impressive range of other activities as members and leaders of student societies and groups and as volunteers, helping and supporting other people on and off campus. So many of you today are receiving a Spirit of Sussex Award for your positive contributions to the community from serving as campus ambassadors to fundraising for local causes to creating new ways for our campus to be more environmentally sustainable.\n\nI commend your commitment to your extracurricular activities. Well done on all you've achieved alongside your formal studies.\n\nOver the past two years, I've had the great privilege of meeting many Sussex alumni from the UK, from Asia, Africa, and the Americas. And I've been overwhelmed by how many of them told me about how much they loved their time at Sussex and how their experience of studying at Sussex had fundamentally shaped their lives and careers. They recalled encountering new ideas and ways of thinking that transformed their worldview as well as making lasting friendships and building networks that have accompanied them ever since. I sincerely hope that you, today's graduands will feel the same in years to come. Whether you already have a job or are taking time to explore the world or are looking for your next opportunity, you can be confident that you're leaving a university with a global reputation. A university that has equipped you with knowledge and skills to think critically and creatively, to work across the boundaries of established knowledge and to understand the importance of a global perspective. You've been tutored and supervised by academics who are internationally recognised for their research and scholarship. The breadth and depth of their research have directly informed your education across the disciplines and in the spaces in between. Our research focuses on the urgent concerns of our time.\n\nSome of you may have seen our 'Impossible until it's done' banners around Brighton and Hove in the last few weeks, inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela. This campaign highlights the work we are doing to tackle pollution in rivers, to find new ways, to treat dementia, and to improve young people's mental health using AI. We know the great value of our research, but we also recognise the importance of sharing our successes and our ambitions with wider audiences. And Sussex has much to celebrate. For the eighth consecutive year, we've been ranked first in the world for Development Studies. This is an outstanding achievement by our academics. Not many British universities can lay claim to that. Development studies which seeks understandings of and progress towards global equity, social justice and sustainability is very much at the heart of what Sussex is about. One of the key measures of the strength and impact of a university is the extent to which the publications of its researchers are cited by other researchers. And Sussex really punches above its weight in this respect. This year, the QS World University Rankings have given us nine subjects in the top 10 in the UK for citations with History and Physics and Astronomy, each ranked first in the UK. We were also recognised as the eighth most sustainable university in the UK and joined 26th in the world, which shows just how much we are doing to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. All this means that Sussex research is improving the lives of individuals and communities around the world, embracing and advancing developments in technology and influencing the policies of government as well as making a positive difference to the protection and regeneration of our natural environment.\n\nNow, I know that many of you graduating today have had difficult life journeys so far, and all of you have lived through the COVID-19 pandemic and the enormous disruption that this caused to your education and social lives. Some of you have struggled with your mental health, some of you with your physical health, some of you have faced loss and family disruption during your student days. Each of you has had a unique route to Sussex and through your time at Sussex and all of you have had your ups and downs. But whatever your Sussex story, I hope when you look back at the time you've been with us, that you feel your studies were intellectually challenging and rigorous, that you were stretched, stimulated, and supported to achieve your best. That you are leaving with knowledge, skills, and personal resources that will stand you in good stead and that you've made connections and friendships that will stay with you long into the future. Now, you'll take many different paths as you join our community of over 200,000 alumni worldwide. Sussex alumni include Nobel laureates, grassroots, campaigners and activists, heads of state and vice presidents, leaders, influencers and creative practitioners in the arts and entertainment, writers, journalists and academics, chief executives of national and multinational organisations. And those with less high profile but no less significant lives and careers, people whose actions and relationships remake and renew the social fabric in small positive ways. Every day, across the globe, in more than 160 countries and in all walks of life, our alumni are sharing the benefits of their Sussex education to make the world a better place. I know you will do that too.\n\nSo graduands, celebrate who you are today. Celebrate the commitment you made to achieve your degree. Celebrate the fact that the sacrifices you made were worth it. Celebrate the belief in yourself that made it possible and celebrate those who helped you reach this point in your journey. In short, celebrate.\n\nI call upon the Head of the Department for Economics, in the University of Sussex Business School, Professor Sambit Bhattacharyya.\n\n(Graduands and guests applaud.)\n\n[Head of the Department for Economics, in the University of Sussex Business School, Professor Sambit Bhattacharyya, stands and approaches the lectern to present the graduands.

You are now graduates of the University of Sussex.\n\n(Graduates and academics/staff stand and after sustained applause, a final video of Chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, starts playing on the large screens above the auditorium.)\n\nChancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar:\n\nHello, it's me again. Congratulations graduates. Very, very well done to all of you. Traditionally, the chancellor is supposed to leave you with some parting words of wisdom. I don't think there's anything I can tell you that you don't instinctively already know, and your instincts that inner voice, are always right by the way. But they speak with the same vocabulary, cadence, inflexion, and grammar as your fears, anxieties, and doubts. So how to tell the difference? Your instincts always come from a place of love. So check in with yourself and make sure that you are always coming from a place of kindness towards yourself and the world around you. Being kind in every situation can be a challenge sometimes. I know it's easier said than done, but the more you practice it, the easier it gets until eventually it's just habit and a part of who you are. You have all achieved magnificently in your academic pursuit and I have no doubt you will apply that to your journey going forward. For dealing with the emotional challenges, anxiety and mental health issues that we all face in an uncertain world we need emotional intelligence. I believe that at the heart of emotional intelligence is compassion, love, and positivity. You know how when we look up at a clear night sky, we can marvel at starlight knowing that those stars may not now even exist yet we can bask in their glow. Love and compassion have the same power. We can and do feel love and kindness from people and events long since gone, and we can do that now for those who will be here when we've long since gone. An act of compassion is like dropping a pebble into a lake. The ripples affect far more and reaches way further than we ever thought or intended. Positivity is not about thinking everything is great all the time. It's being aware that things are tough, but believing and knowing that that is not permanent, that things can and will change. I've lived this experience at 32. I was unemployed, in debt and living with my parents. I could not conceive that within two years I'd be working on TV and movies and not what my business degree had planned for me. Going further, back at 18, I applied here to Sussex, my first choice for university. I didn't get in... something about my grades not being good enough... so I went elsewhere and waited until all those responsible for me not to getting in, had retired, were in prison, deported, or were just playing dead. And at the age of 46, I came back here as chancellor. So ha ha, ha ha! And going back even further, still, when I was five years old, an uncle asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, Actor -I said. My father said; \"It's pronounced doctor.\" But 30 years later, and since I've been living and doing what I dreamed of, obviously, I'm someone who plays the long game. My point is that all of those moments have been amongst the most surprising, positive experiences of my life and have led to other extraordinary experiences including bringing me here today, thus obliterating, all of the negative ones I had before. It taught me that I have no idea exactly what's in my future, and neither do you. But you want to stay in the game until the good stuff comes around and be ready for it when it does. One of my favourite quotes is from the great American poet, Maya Angelou, who I was lucky to have met once, and she said; \"People may forget what you did. People may forget what you said. People will never forget the way you made them feel.\" The final key to emotional intelligence, I wanna mention, is listening and talking. It's obvious, right? Listening. Really hearing what someone is saying to you is essential. People aren't always consciously saying what they're feeling, so like a detective waiting for that vital piece of information, you have to be really on it. My aunt always used to say; you have two ears and one mouth. So always listen twice as much as you talk. And talking, when we're overwhelmed by anything, fear, anger, grief, greed, even beauty and love, the thing we lose is perspective even momentarily and in those moments, we may act in haste and without the clarity that's required. The quickest way to perspective is to pause and then talk to someone. Get an alternative point of view that's not also been created in your own head. But choose wisely beforehand 'cause these will be the excellent listeners I mentioned and will not necessarily be convenient, but will tell you their honest opinion in the most compassionate way. And if you can't find someone to talk to, get yourself a sense of humour. If you can see that, that overwhelming, terrifying thing is also silly then it is no longer just a terrifying thing. Instant perspective. Mahatma Gandhi said; Be the change you want to see in the world. So if you want to see a more compassionate world, you be more compassionate. You wanna see more accountability, then you be more accountable. I hope we meet in person at some point, in which case, feel free to come up and say, I'm a Sussex graduate and you owe me a hug or a handshake or a high five! Or ignore me if you want. It's up to you. Either way, I wish you all success in everything you do next. Take your compassion, positivity, humour, and power and change your world. Someone's world. The world.\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nI now declare this ceremony closed.\n\n[Music playing] (Senior academics and staff on stage tip their hats as two academics/staff walk across the stage to pick up the ceremonial torches from the small, raised table.

I am the chancellor of the University of Sussex. A lot of you probably already knew that, but um, I thought the beard might throw you. It's for a character I'm playing in a TV thing. It is real! If I'd been there, I would've invited you to give it a tug to check its authenticity as you cross the stage - or not. Anyway, I digress.Well, well here we are. Well, here you are. I am of course somewhere else, but here in spirit and in admiration. Apologies for gate-crashing your day, but I just couldn't help crowbarring myself into your celebration. I wanted to add the warmest of welcomes to all of you, graduands, families and friends and to those like me who may be following the ceremony remotely. Sussex graduations have become known for being a festival, a bit of a party, and it's a tradition that I hope you'll continue today.This is your day, so express your joy and positivity when you cross the stage. And friends and family, this is your day too, so take a moment to be prepared with your cameras for the moment your superstar crosses the stage and make as much noise as you can when they do.Oh, come on, they've embarrassed you enough times in the past. So this is payback time.Have a great ceremony and I'll catch you on the other side.\n\n[Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sasha Roseneil, stands and approaches the lectern to make an introductory speech.]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nDistinguished guests, colleagues, parents, supporters, friends, and above all our graduands, the Sussex class of 2024. It's my great honour and enormous pleasure to welcome you to the Brighton Centre for this graduation ceremony.\n\nI'm Professor Sasha Roseneil, vice-chancellor and president of the University of Sussex. Graduands, as our chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar has just reminded us, today is about you. It's a day of celebration for you and of you and of all that you've achieved during your time at Sussex. It's also a moment to acknowledge that many of you have benefited in countless tangible and less tangible ways from the love and support of your family or guardians and carers. From the encouragement of your friends and of course from the teaching and guidance of staff at the university. You may also have had support from our alumni and donors who've generously provided scholarships that have enabled you to study at Sussex.\n\nSo I'm now going to ask you, our graduands for some participation. Would you please stand up and turn and face the audience behind you; your friends, families, and supporters? Please stand and if you are able, would you give them a hearty cheer and a round of applause?\n\n(Graduands stand and give a big round of applause.)\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil continues:\n\nThank you, please be seated again.\n\nAs the University of Sussex, we're committed to providing an inclusive, respectful, and supportive environment for every member of our diverse and international community. And that extends to our celebrations today. This is an important event, not only in the life of our graduands, but for everyone in the auditorium. Many of whom have travelled a very long way to be with us. Sussex students represent the most wonderful variety of backgrounds, beliefs, and identities. You come each year from over 130 countries around the world. So people in the audience today are of many different nationalities and faiths and amongst everyone gathered here, there's a huge diversity of opinion and belief about almost every matter under the sun. And that diversity of thought and belief is a very special thing. Something that Sussex as a university seeks always to uphold and support. We have a foundational commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom and it's our job as a university to create an environment in which diversity of belief and opinion can be explored. It's our job to nurture the conditions under which our students and staff can respectfully discuss and debate difficult ideas where propositions can be tested, analysis undertaken, theories developed, and where minds can be expanded and changed. We are living in deeply troubled times with war and conflict, terror, death, and the destruction of habitats, economic hardship, hunger and inequality, as well as the climate crisis and environmental degradation giving rise to enormous concern among Sussex students. Many Sussex students and their families and loved ones, I'm sure, hold passionate opinions about the causes, consequences and solutions to these issues. And as we gather here today to celebrate graduation, I'd like to emphasise that the university supports and will always support freedom of expression that is lawful and respectful of others, mindful of humanity and diversity. That's at the heart of our university community and that binds us together across nations and faiths as a global community.\n\nSo Sussex graduands, I'd like to thank you all for all that you've contributed to making our university a place of community inclusion and diversity, an open, warm and welcoming place. In the two years since I became vice-chancellor, I've come to realise that Sussex students are the very embodiment of energy, hope, and possibility. Alongside your academic work, many of you have taken part and in an impressive array of other activities as members and leaders of student societies and groups and as volunteers helping and supporting other people on and off campus. Many of you are today receiving a Spirit of Sussex Award for your positive contributions to the community. From serving as campus ambassadors to fundraising for local causes and creating new ways for our campus to be more environmentally sustainable. I commend your commitment to extracurricular activities. Well done on all you have done alongside your formal studies.\n\nOver the past two years, I've had the great privilege of meeting many Sussex alumni from the uk, from Asia, Africa and the Americas. And I've been overwhelmed by how many of them told me how much they loved their time at Sussex and how their experience at Sussex had fundamentally shaped their lives and careers. They recalled encountering new ideas and ways of thinking that transform their worldview as well as making lasting friendships and building networks that have accompanied them ever since. I sincerely hope that you, today's graduands will feel the same in the years to come. Whether you already have a job or are taking time to explore the world or are looking for your next opportunity, you can be confident that you're leaving a university with a global reputation. A university that has equipped you with knowledge and skills to think critically and creatively, to work across the boundaries of established knowledge and to understand the importance of a global perspective. You've been tutored and supervised by academics who are internationally recognised for their research and scholarship. The breadth and depth of their research has directly informed your education across the disciplines and in the spaces in between. Our research focuses on the urgent concerns of our time.\n\nSome of you might have seen our 'Impossible until it's done' Banners around Brighton and Hove and on the buses over recent weeks. Inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela, this campaign highlights the work we are doing to tackle pollution in rivers, to find new ways, to treat dementia, and to improve young people's mental health using artificial intelligence. We know the great value of our research, but we also recognise the importance of sharing our successes and our ambitions with wider audiences. And Sussex has much to celebrate. For the eighth consecutive year with our campus partner, the Institute of Development Studies, we've been ranked first in the world for Development Studies. This is an outstanding achievement by our academics. Development studies seek an understanding of and progress towards global equity, social justice and sustainability, which is very much at the heart of what Sussex is about. One of the key measures of the strength and the impact of a university is the extent to which the publications of its researchers are cited by other researchers. Sussex really punches above our weight in this respect. This year in the QS World University Rankings, we have nine subjects in the top 10 in the UK for citations with History and Physics and Astronomy, each ranked first in the UK. We were also recognised as the eighth most sustainable university in the UK and Joint 26th in the world, which just shows how much we're contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. All this means that Sussex research is improving the lives of individuals and communities around the world, enhancing and advancing developments in technology and influencing the policies of governments as well as making a positive difference to the protection and regeneration of our natural environment.\n\nNow I know that many of you graduating today have had difficult life journeys so far, and all of you have lived through the COVID-19 pandemic and the enormous disruption this caused to your education and social lives. Some of you have struggled with your mental health, some with your physical health. Some of you have faced loss and family disruption during your student days. Each of you has had a unique route to and through Sussex, and each of you will have had your ups and downs. But whatever your Sussex story, I hope you'll look back at your time here and feel that your studies were intellectually challenging and rigorous. That you were stretched, stimulated, and supported to achieve your best. That you're leaving with knowledge and skills and personal resources that will stand you in good stead and that you made connections and friendships that will stay with you for a long time. You are now joining our community of more than 200,000 alumni worldwide. Sussex alumni include Nobel laureates, grassroots, campaigners and activists, heads of state and vice presidents, leaders, influencers and creative practitioners in the arts and entertainment, writers, journalists and academics, chief executives of national and multinational organisations. And those with less high-profile but no less significant lives and careers. People whose actions and relationships remake and renew the social fabric in small ways. Every day, across the globe, in more than 160 countries and in all walks of life, our alumni are sharing the benefits of their Sussex experience to make the world a better place. I know you will do that too.\n\nSo graduands, celebrate who you are today. Celebrate the commitment you made to achieve your degree. Celebrate the fact that the sacrifices you made were worth it. Celebrate the belief in yourself that's made it possible and celebrate those who helped you reach this point in your journey. In short, celebrate.\n\nI call upon Professor Farai Jena, Associate Dean for Education and Students in the University of Sussex Business School.\n\n(Graduands and guests applaud.)\n\n[Professor Farai Jena, Associate Dean for Education and Students in the University of Sussex Business School, stands and approaches the lectern to present the graduands.

Graduands, please will you stand again? And colleagues behind me, would you please stand?\n\n[Graduands and staff stand.]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nBy the powers invested in me by the University of Sussex, by confer degrees on all those referred to by the Provost-Chancellor.\n\nCongratulations, you are now graduates of the University of Sussex!\n\n(Graduates and academics/staff stand and after sustained applause, a final video of Chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, starts playing on the large screens above the auditorium.)\n\nChancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar:\n\nHello, it's me again. Congratulations graduates. Very, very well done to all of you. Traditionally, the chancellor is supposed to leave you with some parting words of wisdom. I don't think there's anything I can tell you that you don't instinctively already know, and your instincts that inner voice, are always right by the way. But they speak with the same vocabulary, cadence, inflexion, and grammar as your fears, anxieties, and doubts. So how to tell the difference? Your instincts always come from a place of love. So check in with yourself and make sure that you are always coming from a place of kindness towards yourself and the world around you. Being kind in every situation can be a challenge sometimes. I know it's easier said than done, but the more you practice it, the easier it gets until eventually it's just habit and a part of who you are. You have all achieved magnificently in your academic pursuit and I have no doubt you will apply that to your journey going forward. For dealing with the emotional challenges, anxiety and mental health issues that we all face in an uncertain world we need emotional intelligence. I believe that at the heart of emotional intelligence is compassion, love, and positivity. You know how when we look up at a clear night sky, we can marvel at starlight knowing that those stars may not now even exist yet we can bask in their glow. Love and compassion have the same power. We can and do feel love and kindness from people and events long since gone, and we can do that now for those who will be here when we've long since gone. An act of compassion is like dropping a pebble into a lake. The ripples affect far more and reaches way further than we ever thought or intended. Positivity is not about thinking everything is great all the time. It's being aware that things are tough, but believing and knowing that that is not permanent, that things can and will change. I've lived this experience at 32. I was unemployed, in debt and living with my parents. I could not conceive that within two years I'd be working on TV and movies and not what my business degree had planned for me. Going further, back at 18, I applied here to Sussex, my first choice for university. I didn't get in... something about my grades not being good enough... so I went elsewhere and waited until all those responsible for me not to getting in, had retired, were in prison, deported, or were just playing dead. And at the age of 46, I came back here as chancellor. So ha ha, ha ha! And going back even further, still, when I was five years old, an uncle asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, Actor -I said. My father said; \"It's pronounced doctor.\" But 30 years later, and since I've been living and doing what I dreamed of, obviously, I'm someone who plays the long game. My point is that all of those moments have been amongst the most surprising, positive experiences of my life and have led to other extraordinary experiences including bringing me here today, thus obliterating, all of the negative ones I had before. It taught me that I have no idea exactly what's in my future, and neither do you. But you want to stay in the game until the good stuff comes around and be ready for it when it does. One of my favourite quotes is from the great American poet, Maya Angelou, who I was lucky to have met once, and she said; \"People may forget what you did. People may forget what you said. People will never forget the way you made them feel.\" The final key to emotional intelligence, I wanna mention, is listening and talking. It's obvious, right? Listening. Really hearing what someone is saying to you is essential. People aren't always consciously saying what they're feeling, so like a detective waiting for that vital piece of information, you have to be really on it. My aunt always used to say; you have two ears and one mouth. So always listen twice as much as you talk. And talking, when we're overwhelmed by anything, fear, anger, grief, greed, even beauty and love, the thing we lose is perspective even momentarily and in those moments, we may act in haste and without the clarity that's required. The quickest way to perspective is to pause and then talk to someone. Get an alternative point of view that's not also been created in your own head. But choose wisely beforehand 'cause these will be the excellent listeners I mentioned and will not necessarily be convenient, but will tell you their honest opinion in the most compassionate way. And if you can't find someone to talk to, get yourself a sense of humour. If you can see that, that overwhelming, terrifying thing is also silly then it is no longer just a terrifying thing. Instant perspective. Mahatma Gandhi said; Be the change you want to see in the world. So if you want to see a more compassionate world, you be more compassionate. You wanna see more accountability, then you be more accountable. I hope we meet in person at some point, in which case, feel free to come up and say, I'm a Sussex graduate and you owe me a hug or a handshake or a high five! Or ignore me if you want. It's up to you. Either way, I wish you all success in everything you do next. Take your compassion, positivity, humour, and power and change your world. Someone's world. The world.\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nI now declare this ceremony closed.\n\n[Music playing] (Senior academics and staff on stage tip their hats as two academics/staff walk across the stage to pick up the ceremonial torches from the small, raised table. They bow to one another before bowing to the rest of the academics/staff. Both lead lines single files of all the professors in separate directions down the staircases on the left and right. The academics and staff walk down the aisles betwixt the audience of seated graduates and guests and exit at the back of the auditorium.)\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/988970854\n\n[‘Trumpet Fanfare’ music playing] (A procession of University senior academics and staff in ceremonial robes enter the auditorium, walk down the aisles betwixt the audience of seated graduands and guests, ascend the stage via staircases on the left and right respectively, and take their seats.

I am the chancellor of the University of Sussex. A lot of you probably already knew that, but um, I thought the beard might throw you. It's for a character I'm playing in a TV thing. It is real! If I'd been there, I would've invited you to give it a tug to check its authenticity as you cross the stage - or not. Anyway, I digress.Well, well here we are. Well, here you are. I am of course somewhere else, but here in spirit and in admiration. Apologies for gate-crashing your day, but I just couldn't help crowbarring myself into your celebration. I wanted to add the warmest of welcomes to all of you, graduands, families and friends and to those like me who may be following the ceremony remotely. Sussex graduations have become known for being a festival, a bit of a party, and it's a tradition that I hope you'll continue today.This is your day, so express your joy and positivity when you cross the stage. And friends and family, this is your day too, so take a moment to be prepared with your cameras for the moment your superstar crosses the stage and make as much noise as you can when they do.Oh, come on, they've embarrassed you enough times in the past. So this is payback time.Have a great ceremony and I'll catch you on the other side.\n\n[Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sasha Roseneil, stands and approaches the lectern to make an introductory speech.]\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil:\n\nMr. Mayor, distinguished guests, colleagues, parents, supporters, friends, and above all our graduands, the Sussex class of 2024. It's my great honour and enormous pleasure to welcome you today to the Brighton Centre for this graduation ceremony.\n\nI'm Professor Sasha Roseneil. I'm the Vice-chancellor and president of the university. Graduands, as our chancellor, Sanjeev Bhaskar has just reminded us, today is all about you. This is a day of celebration for you and of you and of all that you've achieved during your time at Sussex. It's also a moment to acknowledge that many of you have benefited in countless tangible and less tangible ways from the love and support of your family or guardians and carers. From the encouragement of your friends and of course from the teaching and guidance of staff at the university. You may also have had support from our alumni and donors in the form of scholarships that they've provided. So I'm now going to ask you for some participation.\n\nGraduands, would you mind standing up and turning and facing the audience behind you? Now that's really interesting because I was gonna ask you to cheer your audience and they're cheering you, so why don't you give them a hearty round of applause and thanks for all their support.\n\n(Graduands stand and give a big round of applause.)\n\nProfessor Sasha Roseneil continues:\n\nWonderful, please be seated again. I can see it's a fantastic mutual admiration society today.\n\nNow, as a University of Sussex, we are committed to providing an inclusive, respectful, and supportive environment for every member of our diverse and international community. And that extends to this celebration today. This is an important event, not just in the lives of our graduands, but for everyone in this auditorium, many of whom have travelled very long distances to be with us. Sussex students represent the most wonderful variety of backgrounds, beliefs, and identities. You come each year from over 130 countries around the world. So we have people in the audience today of many different nationalities and faiths. And amongst everyone gathered here, there is surely a huge diversity of opinion and belief about almost every matter under the sun. And that diversity of thought and belief is a very special thing. Something that Sussex as a university seeks always to uphold and support. We have a foundational commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom. It's our job as a university to create an environment in which diversity of belief and opinion can be explored. It's our job to nurture the conditions under which our students and staff can respectfully discuss and debate difficult ideas, where propositions can be tested, analysis undertaken, theories developed, and where minds can be expanded and changed. We are living in deeply troubled times with war and conflict, terror, death, and the destruction of habitats, economic hardship, hunger and inequality, as well as climate crisis, as environmental degradation, giving rise to enormous concern amongst Sussex students. Many Sussex students and their families and loved ones, I'm sure, hold passionate opinions about the causes, consequences and solutions to these issues. And as we gather here today to celebrate graduation, I would like to emphasise that the university supports and will always support freedom of expression that is lawful and respectful of others, mindful of the humanity and diversity that's at the heart of our university community. And that binds us together across nations and faiths as a global community.\n\nSo Sussex graduands, I would like to thank you for all that you have contributed to making our university a place of community, inclusion and diversity. An open, warm and welcoming place. In the two years since I became vice-chancellor, I've come to see that Sussex students are the very embodiment of energy, hope, and possibility. Alongside your academic work, many of you have taken part in an impressive range of other activities as members and leaders of students, societies and groups, and as volunteers, helping and supporting other people on and off campus. Many of you today are receiving a spirit of Sussex Award for your contributions to our community. From serving as campus ambassadors to fundraising for local causes and creating new ways for our campus to be more environmentally sustainable. I commend your commitment to your extracurricular activities. Well done on all that you've achieved alongside your formal studies. Over the past two years, I've had the great privilege of meeting many Sussex alumni in the UK, in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. And I've been overwhelmed by how many of them told me how much they loved their student days at Sussex and how their experience of studying at Sussex had fundamentally shaped their lives and careers. They recalled encountering new ideas and ways of thinking that transformed their worldview as well as making lasting friendships and building networks that have accompanied them ever since. I sincerely hope that you, today's graduands, will feel the same in years to come. Whether you already have a job or are taking time to explore the world or are looking for your next opportunity, you can be confident that you are leaving a university with a global reputation.
