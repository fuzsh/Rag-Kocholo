        "text": "Overall 8.5\n\nStory 9.5\n\nActing/Cast 9.0\n\nMusic 7.5\n\nRewatch Value 7.0\n\nFun and cute\n\nAlthough it is short, and therefore the story is a little to quick for my taste, it is a very funny show and you can easily watch all of them in a row. Important not to miss the alterante ending, which I prefered (but both endings are fine for me).\n\nCharacters' interactions are very interesting as well, they are caring for each other at first (some sort of \"team spirit\"), then starting to realize have body switch is an open door to new experiences, but it all very cute in the end.\n\nThe cast is really good in their acting, once they switched bodies they really can play the original character and it looks great. Definetly the best for me is Patrick's performance, with Xio CHi (the student) trapped in A Bu's body (the Sauna owner)\n\nKind warning, BL lovers might be a little disappointed by the show, as it is not the main plot. I originally started to watch it for this reason, but honestly I didn't mind at all the fact that it was not the center of the show.\n\nIn any case, I recommand highly to watch it, it won't take you long and you'll definetly laugh in front of it!\n\nRead More\n\nWas this review helpful to you?\n\nOverall 6.0\n\nStory 5.0\n\nActing/Cast 9.0\n\nMusic 7.0\n\nRewatch Value 5.0\n\nShort Review: Nice so-so story with very good “main” casts.\n\nBL moments: 6.50 I was actually dissapointed. This not a hardcore BL. If you are looking for the “sweet, puppy-eyed, super-yummy long stares” between two young men... Nah! You’ll get a not so young gay (A-bu in HuaHua’s body) in a woman’s body selfishly looking for the love of his/her gay life. Though the ending for A-bu was good, it was nit explicitly shown, only hinted.\n\nXiao Chi into A-bu’s body: And this is where i think a lot my disappointment comes from... Xaio Chi/ChiChi in Abu’s body, the moment their spirit/sould swapped I was like “uh-uh. Young-young BL is dead.” And then I thought “Old-young BL probably.” But geez, the BL moments were more of an after thought of the writers. BUT that kiss when he was drawing the customer tried to make up for this, but still in the end, no BL for Xiao Chi.\n\nHuaHua into Xiao Chi’s body: I got to say this. I watched this series because of Edward. I remember him from the Red Balloon series and saw that this is tagged as another BL. I thought he will be cast as gay here. But yeah... he was not. His character’s soul though is gay (see above) but as HuaHua in Xiao Chi, he is cast as M-F couple.\n\nActing: 9.00 acting of the main characters were good. Edward Chen (Xiao Chi) definitwly had improved since the Red Balloon seriesz\n\nCinematography: 8.00 Shots were of the usual tv-like caliber. Some scenes are good but some transitions are too abrupt. Or I just felt that way because each episodes were short.\n\nSetting/locale/interaction with people surrounding them: 5.00 it was only addressed on ChiChi/HuaHua’s situation. And too few scenes were depicted that the characters had swapped bodies/soul. Its as if the people around them knew they had been swapped. No weirdness, no “massive” change in lifestyle, etc. (Except for HuaHua/A-bu’s mentrual period.)\n\nStory/Writing: 6.50 for the underlying FRIENDSHIP theme, 5.00 for the rest. the premise although not unique has promises which the writers did not expounded more. The beginnings (ep 1-4) were good and then they went down into mediocrity. Maybe they had ran out of ideas to support the core story and end up doing pairings until they reach a so-so ending.\n\nRead More\n\nWas this review helpful to you?"
