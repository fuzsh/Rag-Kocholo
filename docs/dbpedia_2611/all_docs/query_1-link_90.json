        "text": "Refresh Man is a romantic comedy television show that premiered on TTV on March 6, 2016, and aired till June 26, 2016. The show's main cast includes popular Taiwanese stars such as Aaron Yan, Lene Lai, Joanne Tseng, and Roy Chang, among others. The show is directed by Jeffrey Chin and is written by Huang Hui-ting and Lu Yiwei. It is produced by Kingone Wang and co-starred by many talented actors, including Marcus Chang, Tracy Chou, and Cherry Ngan, among others.\n\nThe show is a classic romantic comedy that portrays the story of two high school classmates, Ji Wen Kai (played by Aaron Yan) and Zhong Yu Tang (played by Joanne Tseng), who reunite as adults after Ji Wen Kai returns to Taiwan from the US. Wen Kai is a successful businessman and a CEO of a multinational firm, while Yu Tang has been working hard at a stagnant job at McUseless (a fictional restaurant chain) for the past ten years. Not only does Wen Kaiâs return rekindle Yu Tangâs unrequited love for him, but it also drives her to change her life by starting her own business.\n\nWen Kai and Yu Tang's professional and personal lives intersect when Wen Kai's company, MUSE Cosmetics, acquires McUseless, and he tasks Yu Tang and her team with revamping the failing restaurant chain. This is where the fun begins as the show portrays the challenges faced by Yu Tang and Wen Kai as they try to improve the lackluster image of McUseless and save the restaurant chain from going bankrupt. Along the way, the two leads face several setbacks, from rival firms to power struggles within the company, and their personal feelings for each other.\n\nRefresh Man does an excellent job of portraying the tension between Yu Tang and Wen Kai's personal and professional relationship. Yu Tang, who has harbored feelings for Wen Kai since high school, finds herself struggling with her attraction towards him, especially since Wen Kai is now her boss. On the other hand, Wen Kai is more focused on his work than his personal life and struggles to understand Yu Tang's feelings.\n\nHowever, despite the romantic subplot, the main focus of the show is Yu Tang's and Wen Kai's personal growth. The show is about their journey towards becoming better versions of themselves. Yu Tang, who has been stuck in a job she hates for ten years, has given up on her dreams and is unsure of her abilities, finally finds purpose in starting her business. Wen Kai, who has spent his entire adult life focused on work, learns about the importance of balancing work and personal life, and ultimately falls in love with Yu Tang. The show also portrays the importance of teamwork, friendship, and loyalty.\n\nRefresh Man is a show that holds its own, despite being just another predictable romantic comedy. The show's natural humor is impressive, and the characters are endearing. The show also benefits from a remarkable cast, with Aaron Yan delivering a charismatic performance as the arrogant CEO. Joanne Tseng is also impressive as the hardworking and plucky Yu Tang, and their chemistry is electric. The show's supporting cast is also worth mentioning, adding their flavor to the show's comedic elements.\n\nThe show's production is also remarkable, with colorful and vibrant visuals. The show's theme song, âLove is Beautiful,\" performed by Jam Hsiao and Lene Lai, adds to its charm. Refresh Man is a breezy and entertaining watch, and though it's not groundbreaking, it achieves what it sets out to do.\n\nIn conclusion, Refresh Man is a well-crafted and entertaining romantic comedy with charming characters, a remarkable cast, and a predictable yet enjoyable plot. The show's theme of personal growth and the importance of following one's dreams makes it relatable, and its humor keeps the audience engaged. Refresh Man is a show that delivers what it promises, and it's a must-watch for fans of the genre."
