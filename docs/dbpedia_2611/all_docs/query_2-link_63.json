        "text": "Background:\n\nThis drama was okay, the Love story between Da Hua (Nikki Xie) and Ouyang Tai aka Terry (Chris Wu) was my favorite. I was rooting for them since the beginning. Nikki played the character Da Hua very well. She had to play two different people with different personalities. She even made it believable!\n\nSubstitute Princess tells the story of how the GM of a major company (Terry) needs to find a substitute for his fiance Lian Yang who has had a major accident where she falls off a cliff on a adventure with him.\n\nIn order to save her father the torture of knowing what has happened Terry goes out and finds Da Hua and with a little plastic surgery she is transformed into his fiance. Only she doesn‚Äôt sound like her at all. With Da Hua‚Äôs ability of memorization she is able to transform herself into Du Liang Yan and together they both set out on a journey that blossoms into something more.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nAfter watching the series, somethings kind of urks my nerves. Just want you guys to know I was team Terry the entire series! Just look at him! He‚Äôs so amazing and that smile :).\n\nMoving on‚Ä¶This photo right here NO NO! The writers kind of played it off that Guan Jun (James Wen) would be the one to end up with Da Hua. I really didn‚Äôt care about Da Hua or Guan Jun just Terry. I hated Da Hua even after she decide to marry Terry but then because someone speaks up and reveals Guan Jun‚Äôs true feelings she cancels the wedding. WHY..WHY..WHY‚Ä¶.!!!\n\nI did like this series in the beginning though. The whole girl who doesn‚Äôt have that much gets swept off her feet by a sophisticated man in power is always a seller. But then, the writers go off on different directions and the show didn‚Äôt seem as appealing. What happened to the ‚Äúvillains?‚Äù There were supposed to be villains, they were there in the beginning such as Terry‚Äôs secretary, Lene Lai who wants to marry him and there is the gangster daughter who is interested in Guan Jun. They are shown in the opening credits and in some episodes portraying their villain characters but then they stops. You get the feeling that there was going to be more scheming..at least from the secretary. Even the gangsters daughter turned good in the end..NO, villains must get what they deserve at the end and that is defeat.\n\nAnyway even though the ending was a little disappointing least it was Terry in the end a happy viewer. I do recommend this drama though and hope you guys love it as much as I do üôÇ\n\nHere are my favorite songs from the drama.\n\nThe opening song, ‚Äù Because You‚Äôre There,‚Äù by Dream Girls\n\nThe ending song, ‚ÄúWoman That is Like a Girl,‚Äù by S.H.E.\n\n‚ÄúMemoria Day‚Äù (The Moment) by Aaron Yan\n\nThis song is not particular a favorite but its not that bad,I still like it, ‚ÄúWhy Bother,‚Äù by James Wu\n\n‚ÄúAlso I,‚Äù by S.H.E.\n\nThanx for reading,\n\n-Charmed üôÇ"
