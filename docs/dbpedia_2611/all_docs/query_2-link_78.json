        "text": "हिंदी से नेपाली - Our Hindi to Nepali translation tool is powered by Google Translation API. You can start typing in the left-hand text area and then click on the \"Translate\" button. Our app will then translate your Hindi word, phrase, or sentence into Nepali.\n\nThe translation only takes a few seconds and allows up to 500 characters to be translated in one request. Although this translation may not be 100% accurate, you can still get a basic idea, and with a few modifications, it can be quite accurate. This translation software is evolving day by day, and Google Engineers are continuously working on it to make Nepali translation more intelligent and accurate. Hopefully, one day it will produce near-perfect translations!\n\nThe Nepali language is widely spoken, with more than 30 million people around the world speaking it. For those who cannot speak Nepali, translating from Nepali to Hindi can be quite difficult. Many websites offer translation services for a fee. While it is a good idea to pay for translating large amounts of text (such as books or articles) or for professional services, there is no need to pay for commonly used sentences, greeting messages, and other informal uses. For these purposes, our tool can be quite helpful.\n\nYou can copy the translated text and then share it on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, or email it to your friends or family."
