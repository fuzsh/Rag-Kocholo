If your name has a direct meaning, we can translate your name instead. Examples of names that can be translated, instead of transliterated include \"Summer\", \"Joy\" or \"Angel\".\n\nIf you don't find your name below, just email me at help@orientaloutpost.com\n\nMore names are added each week - Just email me at help@orientaloutpost.com if you want yours added!\n\nThere are 10955 names listed below - hopefully one of them is yours...\n\nT\n\nthibault\n\nDon't worry if your name in not on any of these lists. We can custom transliterate virtually any name into Chinese.\n\nPlease just email me at help@orientaloutpost.com if you need your name transliterated. If you name is not common, please give me some clues as to how it is pronounced phonetically.\n\nThis page is often searched for as:\n\nNames in Chinese Letters\n\n...Though technically, the term \"Chinese letters\" is incorrect, as they are ideograms, glyph, symbols, or characters, but not letters."
