        "text": "Did you know that the scientific name of the lion’s mane mushroom, Hericium erinaceus, literally translates to hedgehog in Latin?\n\nThis is because it’s thought to look like a faceless hedgehog.\n\nPerhaps you might think this mushroom looks more like a lion’s mane, as it’s commonly referred to. Or do you think it looks more like a beard or a monkey head, which are all synonymous with Hericium erinaceus?\n\nIf you’re wondering, “Is there a wild poisonous lion’s mane mushroom?” Today, we’ll answer your question, delve deeper into the unique characteristics of lion’s mane, and explain how there’s more to this fungi than the brain-supporting properties it’s known for. We’ll also explore:\n\nLion’s mane mushroom lookalikes\n\nHow to identify lion’s mane mushrooms while foraging\n\nOther sources for acquiring lion’s mane\n\nHow to pick the right lion’s mane supplement for the first time\n\nTwo Lion’s Mane Mushroom Lookalikes\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Hericium means hedgehog in Latin. Hericium species, including the lion’s mane, have icicle-like structures resembling a hedgehog’s spines, making them easy to misidentify.\n\nOther Hericium mushrooms in the Hericium genus include:\n\nHericium americanum (Bear's head tooth)\n\nHericium coralloides (Coral tooth fungus)\n\nFeatures of Hericium Americanum - Bear's Head Tooth\n\nThe bear’s head tooth fungus grows on living or dead hardwood species and softwood trees as well.\n\nHericium americanum (Bear’s head tooth) has the following main features:\n\nClusters of branches bearing spines\n\nSpines look like dripping candle wax\n\nUp to a 12-inch wide fruiting body\n\nSpines are between 1–4” long\n\nIt’s white when fresh but turns yellow as it ages.\n\nFeatures of Hericium Coralloides - Coral Tooth\n\nThis mushroom is also known as the coral tooth fungus and resembles a branched hard coral—hence the name.\n\nHericium coralloides wild mushrooms have the following features:\n\nGrows on hardwood species such as oak, silver maple, and sugar maple trees\n\nWhite when fresh but turns tan as it matures\n\nFruiting body has multiple irregularly shaped branches of varying lengths\n\nBranches fork off from the stem and from other branches\n\nShort spines averaging ⅓” long grow from the branches\n\nNow that we’ve learned about the two lion’s mane mushroom lookalikes, let’s explore proper identification techniques for lion’s mane and what distinguishes it from these doppelgangers.\n\nIdentifying Lion’s Mane Mushrooms in the Wild\n\nThe lion’s mane mushroom grows on decaying or live deciduous and hardwood trees and can also be found on beech and oak trees. It appears widely throughout North America, Canada, Europe, and Asia.\n\nYou can find lion’s mane mushrooms on fallen logs—including dying hardwood trees—or much higher on a living tree’s trunk. It's a cool-weather mushroom and can be found in late summer and fall in North America or in winter and spring in warmer climates.\n\nThis Hericium species has the following characteristics:\n\nWhite while fresh but turns yellow as it matures\n\nLarge fruiting body of up to 16 inches in diameter\n\nRounded mass of icicle-like spines\n\nLong spines of up to 2 inches long\n\nWhen harvesting Lion’s Mane, look for these characteristics: It grows on hardwood trees and has a round mass of icicle-like spines.\n\nOther Names for Lion’s Mane Wild Mushrooms\n\nLet’s now look at how all the other common names for H. eracineus describe its features.\n\nLion’s mane mushroom: While growing, its long spines look shaggy and resemble a lion’s mane.\n\nMonkey head mushroom: Its large fruiting body and hair-like structures bundled together look like a monkey’s head. Something to keep in mind when mushroom foraging.\n\nBearded tooth mushroom: The lion’s mane mushroom spines are also referred to as teeth, a mushroom structure unique to Hericiums. Bundled together, the teeth, which are longer than 1 inch, look like an old man’s beard.\n\nFaceless hedgehog: When the lion’s mane mushroom is young, it is shaped like a snowball, and its spines are relatively short. When foraging lion’s mane, know that it looks like a faceless hedgehog at this stage.\n\nPom pom mushroom: The round, shaggy look of lion’s mane resembles a cheerleader’s pom poms.\n\nKey Distinguishing Characteristics and Differences Between Lion’s Mane Mushroom Lookalikes\n\nIf you’re foraging Lion’s Mane, its key identifying feature is its snowball-like shape, from which the spines emanate.\n\nBoth H. americanum and H. coralloides spines grow from branches that emerge from the stem or other branches. But, H. erinaceus doesn't branch and its spines hang from a central stalk.\n\nThe following table highlights the differences between a lion’s mane mushroom and its lookalikes to help you differentiate between them when mushroom foraging.\n\nExpert tip: Though the genus name Hericium means hedgehog in Latin, only lion’s mane (H.erinaceus) is referred to as hedgehog mushrooms.\n\nNote: There's a completely separate mushroom known as the hedgehog mushroom that has a cap-and-stem mushroom shape with “teeth” instead of gills on its underside. However, this mushroom isn't in the same family as the Hericium. It belongs to the Hydnaceae family instead. As a cousin of chanterelle mushrooms, it is likewise a delicious edible mushroom.\n\nLion’s Mane Mushroom Lookalikes Health Benefits\n\nFortunately, none of the lion’s mane mushrooms lookalikes are poisonous.\n\nThese three species in the Hericium genus are edible and can be used for culinary purposes.\n\nNutritional Profile of Lion’s Mane and Its Lookalikes\n\nLion’s mane mushrooms are not only delicious but also have a rich nutritional profile, which makes them an ideal culinary mushroom.\n\nMost people claim they have an earthy taste with a hint of seafood flavor, but apart from taste, what really matters is their nutritional value.\n\nLike the other culinary functional mushrooms, such as shiitake and maitake, lion’s mane is an ideal source of protein, fiber, and other nutrients essential for a healthy diet [1].\n\nComparative to lion’s mane mushroom (H. erinaceus), there is little research on the nutritional and functional properties of its lookalikes, H. coralloides and H. americanum. One exception concerns the antioxidant properties of these mushrooms. There is more than one study that confirms the high antioxidant content of H. coralloides and H. americanum [5,6]. In fact, one study found that H. coralloides has even higher levels of antioxidants than lion’s mane.\n\nHowever, lion’s mane mushroom is a mushroom that has been extensively cultivated, so it is the Hericium mushroom that you can find and buy most easily. Take advantage of the accessibility of lion’s mane to tap into this rich source of antioxidants and nutrients.\n\nBrain-Supporting Properties of Hericium Mushrooms\n\nHericium mushrooms also contain compounds known as hericenones and erinacines [2]. The lion’s mane mushroom has been used extensively to study these compounds.\n\nStudied effects of hericenones and erinacines:\n\nProtect your body’s nerves and neurons [2]\n\nSupport healthy memory function\n\nShield your brain from the normal cognitive decline [3]\n\nSupport a positive mood and relieve oxidative stress [3]\n\nSo, are these lion’s mane mushroom benefits from the hericenones and erinacines interchangeable with the other mushrooms in the Hericium genus? There is very little research yet to guarantee that this is true.\n\nHowever, one study identified compounds unique to H. coralloides that appear to have qualities that induce nerve growth and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [4]. The compounds in lion’s mane are similar and induce the same kinds of effects. Both these mushrooms’ compounds have implications for supporting brain and nervous system health. The study’s findings further support Hericium as a mushroom genus with brain-boosting properties.\n\nSources of Fresh Lion’s Mane Mushroom\n\nFortunately, foraging is not the only way to get fresh lion’s mane mushrooms because they are sold in grocery stores and farmers’ markets. You, however, have to ensure you buy organic mushrooms.\n\nMushrooms are very absorbent and will soak in pesticides and pollutants when grown inorganically. These chemicals are almost impossible to wash off once absorbed by the fungus, and you might end up ingesting them in your cooked lion’s mane mushrooms.\n\nTo ensure you buy organic fresh lion’s mane mushrooms, check food markets that sell organic foods.\n\nIf you’re in the United States, ensure that the mushroom packaging has an organic seal from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This proves that the mushrooms are organically farmed, have passed inspection, and were grown using natural processes.\n\nIf you can’t find fresh lion’s mane from grocery stores in your area, consider growing your own. You can easily order lion’s mane mushroom growing kits online.\n\nCooked vs. Extracted: Best Way to Take Lion’s Mane Mushroom\n\nWhile adding fresh mushrooms to your diet is a good way to get their nutritional benefits, you won’t get all of the lion’s mane mushroom health benefits this way. Your body can’t absorb most of the active compounds from the cooked mushrooms.\n\nActive compounds such as hericenones, erinacines, and beta-glucans are responsible for most of the lion’s mane mushroom health benefits, like its brain-boosting traits.\n\nThese compounds must be extracted using specific mushroom extraction processes suitable for lion’s mane.\n\nExtract powders have a higher bioavailability of active compounds, which means your body gets all the benefits of these functional mushrooms.\n\nHowever, you should exercise extra caution when buying a lion’s mane supplement since not all supplements are equal.\n\nSome are made from non-organic mushrooms, while others are made from mycelium (the “root system” of the mushroom). Using a mycelium-based supplement means you get more starch than health-benefiting compounds.\n\nConsider the following while picking a lion’s mane supplement for the first time:\n\nIs the supplement made from the mushroom (fruiting body)?\n\nDoes the product label indicate a beta-glucan content of at least 15%?\n\nAre the supplements extracted using hot-water extraction?\n\nIs the supplement organic and tested for purity?\n\nThis buying guide for lion's mane mushroom powder extracts provides more details on why each of the above factors is crucial. Following it will ensure you get a lion's mane powder extract that has the beneficial compounds you require to reap the lion's mane's broader health advantages.\n\nBoost Your Mental Focus and Clarity With Real Mushrooms’ Lion’s Mane Supplements\n\nReal Mushrooms provides Organic Lion’s Mane Extracts in powder and capsule form, from 100% real mushrooms (fruiting bodies).\n\nAfter harvesting lion's mane, we use the hot water extraction method to ensure our supplements have a high beta-glucan content of more than 25%.
