        "text": "Despite advances in the treatment, non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world [1]. In particular, the overall prognosis is poor for the metastatic stages, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 8 to 10 months. Even in the early nonmetastatic stages, the 5-year survival rate is as low as 50% [2], [3]. Prognostic markers are needed to stratify patients with different risk outcome. Several biomarkers have been evaluated in NSCLC, but only a few have proven to be clinically relevant. An activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is both a well-described predictive marker of benefit of EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors but also a debated prognostic marker of better OS [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. As EGFR expression has been associated with OS in head and neck, colorectal, and esophagus cancer [10], [11], [12], attention has been directed toward the use of EGFR expression as a prognostic marker in NSCLC, but contradicting results have been demonstrated [13], [14], [15], [16]. The EGF system is complex, and the effect of ligand-receptor interaction depends on a variety of different factors, which provides a plausible explanation for the divergence observed between studies that only evaluate EGFR expression in general. EGFR is one out of four related receptors from the EGF system and is capable of forming homodimers or heterodimers with one of the three other receptors when activated by a ligand. Several ligands from the EGF system such as amphiregulin (AREG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor–α (TGF-α) only activate EGFR, whereas some have the ability to activate several combinations of the four EGF receptors like heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), epiregulin (EPI), and betacellulin (BCL). Most knowledge on the role of the ligands in NSCLC is from in vitro studies or from smaller clinical studies. In vitro studies have suggested that the biological effect of EGFR activation is dependent on the specific activating ligand as well as the dimerization partner [17]. Yet, no clinical studies have evaluated the effect of the network of receptors and ligands influencing EGFR in NSCLC. Furthermore, the majority of the clinical studies exploring EGFR expression are based on immunohistochemistry which is a semiquantitative method with a great risk of interobserver variability. Quantitative gene expression analyses provide a more accurate measure and are therefore more suitable for studies comparing expression levels. Prospectively, we have collected fresh tumor samples from patients suspected of lung cancer. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to evaluate the gene expression of the network of receptors and ligands of the EGF system affecting EGFR as a prognostic markers in NSCLC.\n\n3. Discussion\n\nThe impact of EGFR expression on OS in NSCLC is controversial. Studies evaluating EGFR expression as a prognostic marker have presented contradicting conclusions [13], [14], [15], [16]. In a meta-analysis by Nakamura et al., expression of the EGFR was not a prognostic marker in NSCLC [13] as opposed to what has been found in other cancers [10], [11], [12]. In vitro studies have indicated that it is not EGFR in itself but the summed effect of the EGF system that leads to tumor growth [17]. In certain studies, coexpression of the other receptors from the EGF system has been evaluated as a prognostic factor, though without convincing results when known clinical confounders are taken into consideration [21], [22], [23]. Expression of the complete network of ligands and receptors interacting with EGFR has not been evaluated as a prognostic factor in NSCLC.\n\nIn concordance with the complexity of the EGF system, we have evaluated the gene expression of each receptor and ligand in 100 NSCLC patients EGFR wild type in a model. We found that this model predicts the outcome of the individual patient, whereas the individual receptor or ligand does not. Our findings support the hypothesis that it is not the individual receptor or ligand but the network that is reflected in the OS. Gene score models have been used in several settings to sum the effect of several markers that may be coexpressed but differ in impact on a given outcome [19], [24], [25]. We show by internal validation that our model is a strong prognostic marker in NSCLC patients even when the known clinical characteristics are taken into account. We also demonstrate that it is the increased expression of the ligands AREG, HB-EGF, EPI, and TGF-α and not the receptors that has the primary impact on the summed effect of the system because removing the effect of the receptors increases the fit of the model. To our knowledge, this has not previously been demonstrated in clinical samples. When establishing the score, we chose an arbitrary approach giving each marker the value of + 1 or − 1 and not the actual coefficient as is done elsewhere [19]. Because of to the small sample size, the actual coefficient for the individual marker is not reliable, especially when splitting into test cohorts of only 50. Optimizing the estimate would lead to a risk of overfitting, and therefore, we chose − 1 or + 1 as coefficients. By doing so, we accept the risk of not being able to incorporate the magnitude of each factor of the EGF system, but in contrast, we do not run the risk of assigning inaccurate coefficients.\n\nA major challenge in explorative gene expression studies is to establish normal values of expression. We identified 111 patients affected by symptoms leading to lung cancer suspicion but where the diagnosis was excluded based on a biopsy from a relevant area of the lung or lymph node. Because of to the consecutive nature of the study, the reference group is younger and there are more never smokers in this group. Despite these differences, we believe the reference group to be valid because it reflects the everyday clinical setting. From the reference group, cut points were defined, resulting in a test where expression above the cut points could be interpreted as truly elevated. Subsequently, we evaluated the prognostic value of the receptors EGFR, HER2, and HER3 and the ligands AREG, HB-EGF, EPI, TGF-α, and EGF. We found that only EPI was a prognostic marker of longer OS, whereas none of the receptors or the remaining ligands were significant predictors of outcome in a multivariate analysis taking the clinicopathological characteristics into account. This contradicts other studies [26], [27]. In a study by Sunaga et al., it was shown that high EPI expression could predict inferior outcome especially in KRAS-mutated patients [27]. It is known that 25% to 30% of NSCLC patients are expected to have a mutation in KRAS. The KRAS mutation status of our patients is unknown, which might explain the contradictory results. Our ability to find a correlation could also be explained by the definition of the cut points. We have used biopsies from patients entering the clinic with symptoms resembling lung cancer to define the cut points, whereas other studies exploring the role of EPI have used either the mean or median value of gene expression [27], [28] or predefined percentages of cancer cells expressing EPI[24], [25], [29]. By using our approach, we address the fact that the EGF system is not exclusively cancer related but also involved in other biological processes likely to take place in normal tissue (i.e., inflammation, etc.). Furthermore, the samples used in this study were collected with the intent to perform gene expression studies compared with studies where mRNA was extracted from archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples.\n\nDespite being unique in this regard, our study faced some limitations. Firstly, the cohort used in this study was consecutively collected, but stages I and II were underrepresented (19 patients), just as only 27 of the patients had squamous histology which was less than expected. We found no effect modification between the score and histology (data not shown), indicating that the expression of ligands had an equal effect in the squamous cell type as well as the nonsquamous EGFR wild-type patient. Secondly, though affecting EGFR, the receptor HER4 and the ligand BTC were not included in the final score model. HER4 was measurable only in 1 of 50 patients in the test cohort; it was not deemed relevant. In the literature, only a few studies have evaluated BTC in clinical samples, and because of limited tissue amount, we chose not to include it in this study. Our findings seem promising, but they need to be validated in an independent cohort. A better understanding of the role of EGFR in NSCLC patients without activating mutations in the EGFR can help generate new strategies for treatment development and perhaps improve the OS for NSCLC patients."
