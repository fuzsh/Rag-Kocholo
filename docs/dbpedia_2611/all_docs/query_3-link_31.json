        "text": "Taiwanese idol drama Die Sterntaler came to a surprisingly abrupt ending this past weekend, bringing in roughly about the same ratings (0.39) as it did when it first aired (0.34). I honestly don't have much to say about it that I haven't said before, except that I wasn't expecting it to end so quickly. It's said 18 episodes for forever on Wikipedia, but with the way things were going, I didn't think everything would wrap up so quickly.\n\nFor those who are wondering what the ending is and whether it stays true to the original jdrama... (SPOILERS) it's ambiguous. Female lead Xiao Cai (Nikki Hsieh) reunites with Yongxiu (Rhydian Vaughan) after Yongtuo (Sphinx Ting) gives her up, but then Yongxiu is busy plotting revenge against his father. Said father dies before he and Yongxiu can reconcile, and it turns out that the whole time Yongxiu was wrongly blaming his dad for the death of Yongxiu's parents (he's adopted). Xiangqi (Reen Yu) finally gets over Yongxiu and goes back to being a flight attendant, and then comes back a month later and says she's pregnant but she doesn't need Yongxiu to take responsibility for it. Xiao Cai heads back to Hokkaido because she's homesick, but Yongxiu stays in Taiwan because he's the boss of the hospital, and then Yongtuo randomly makes a trip to Japan because he still loves Xiao Cai. And.... that's how the drama ends.\n\nSo now that Die Sterntaler is over, what's going to take its place? I just realized that I actually have no idea what's airing during the Taiwanese Sunday night idol drama time slots, which is unusual because I usually keep up with it somewhat, so here's a quick rundown.\n\nKing Flower (金大花的華麗冒險) on TTV\n\nStarring: Nikki Hsieh, James Wen, Chris Wu, Lene Lai, Guo Shuyao (Yao Yao), MC40, Double Chao\n\nThis is the only one of whose existence I was marginally aware, since it aired right after Miss Rose, people have blogged about it, and I actually recognize a majority of the actors. While I think the acting side shows promise, I'm a little worn out from twdramas that air while they're being filmed, which I'm pretty sure is the case in this one since it's by SETTV.\n\nGeneral plot: Buck-toothed Jin Dahua (Nikki Hsieh) is harboring a crush on Lin Guanjun (James Wen). The two grew up together, because Guanjun's parents died when he was young and he was taken in by Dahua's mom, and he treats her like a sister and is never willing to admit that he has feelings for her. One day, Dahua sees Ouyang Tai (Chris Wu) with his fiancee Du Liangyan (Nikki Hsieh) in her mom's grocery store, and she gets jealous, wondering if she too could have a love like that if she became as pretty as Liangyan.\n\nOf course, the pretty couple have their own problems. Liangyan is the apple of her father's eye, and she's never done anything dangerous in her life, so as to keep her father from worrying. Inside, however, she thirsts to try something dangerous. After her engagement to Ouyang Tai, she gets her first taste of freedom and learns that he used to really like mountaineering. She pleads him to take her mountaineering with him. Ouyang Tai is a perfectionist and bears the responsibility of his family's business on his shoulders, and he deeply loves Liangyan and thus complies to her every wish. On their mountaineering trip, however, Liangyan falls off a cliff and is rushed to the hospital, changing the lives of everyone involved.\n\nSpring Love (美人龍湯) on FTV\n\nStarring: Mike He, Ivy Lin Yingzhen, Sato Mai, Nylon Chen, Fang Wenlin, Li Xuan\n\nFor some reason, I have never had an interest in watching any of Mike He's dramas (well, maybe Devil Beside You, but only because of Kingone Wang), and this one is no different. Nylon Chen's name caught my eye a bit, but I have no idea if he's a good actor, and for some reason, neither the opening nor ending themes are by him!? I mean, he dominates the majority of the soundtrack, but they gave the ending theme to freakin' Aaron Yan. WHY.\n\nGeneral plot: Long Tai (Mike He) is an extremely filial young man living in Japan. Every day he helps his mother Michiko (Fang Wenlin) in the fish market, and when the two return home, he takes on all the household tasks, in the hopes of lessening the toil on his mother. However, the long and exhausting years finally take their toll on Michiko's body and her heart gives out. Prior to her death, she reveals to her son that he is actually called Long Tianhao.\n\n26 years before our story begins, Michiko was working in Taiwan and fell in love with businessman Long Shoucheng. They secretly got engaged, but his parents were against the relationship. Long Shoucheng's mother even arranged a car accident so that Michiko would miscarry. Michiko promised her mother-in-law that she would leave Taiwan after she gave birth to the child. After giving birth to twins, she discovered that the younger brother (Long Tianhao) was weak and may not be able to survive, so she smuggled him away to Japan.\n\nMichiko's last wish was to see the wild sakura in the Long family home, so Long Tai/Tianhao decides to bring his mother's ashes to Taiwan. In a set of accidents, he is confused for his twin brother Long Tianhe and ends up winning some competition. Because Long Tianhe is supposed to be out of the country undergoing a surgery, Tianhe's childhood friend/rival Zhao Renhu (Nylon Chen) becomes suspicious.\n\nDue to a bet on the outcome of the competition, Zhao Renhu has to send his little sister Zhao Renmei (Ivy Lin) to help out with the Long family business for a year. He also wants her to find out why Long Tianhe suddenly looked so much healthier, since he apparently used to suffer chronically from illnesses. Renmei is not really willing to help out, though, since she doesn't understand why she's the one being punished for her brother's silly bet.\n\nAlthough she grew up in an affluent household, Renmei had a gloomy childhood because she was teased for her round stature and was always ignored by her grandmother. Also, no one knows that she has always had a crush on her brother's archenemy, namely Long Tianhe, even though he was cruel to her when they were little. Faced with the prospect of having to work for Tianhe, she tries to run away the night before but is discovered.\n\nShe's pretty miserable at the beginning, but then she sees that most of the Long household treats her well. Long Tai/Tianhao is still masquerading as his twin brother Tianhe, so he's obviously not as cruel to her. Renmei decides to find out why Tianhe changed so much.\n\nThere's more in the summary, especially involving some girl from Japan who's chasing after Long Tai/Tianhao, but this is getting super long, so we'll leave it at that.\n\nK Song Lover (K歌·情人·夢) on CTS\n\nStarring: Nicholas Teo, Cai Huangru, Evonne Hsu, Van Fan\n\nThe only actor from this whom I've actually seen in anything is Van Fan, the guy from Cape No. 7 and Unbeatable II. This is apparently a music idol drama sort of thing? I guess the concept is kind of interesting, but Roy Chiu is playing a rock singer in his upcoming drama, so I'd honestly rather watch that. But I'm sure the diehard Van Fan fans (lol) are excited about this one, since he's not in dramas often.\n\nGeneral plot: Gu Haoyu (Nicholas Teo), also known as Hao Zi, signs a contract with a record company because of his creative style. However, he later leaves the company to pursue his own ideals and creates a boyband called SUPER 131.\n\nJust as Hao Zi is losing faith in the music industry, an under-achieving ruffian and record producer named Du Fei (Van Fan) comes calling. He says that Hao Zi has talent but is in need of training, and he wants Hao Zi to join a band of his own, called Super Seed, and participate in Asia's number one music competition. Crazily enough, Hao Zi agrees to the plan.\n\nI'm guessing the rest of the drama leads up to the competition finale, and goes through how Hao Zi gets along with his fellow band members, all of whom are very random people who are passionate about music and were found by Du Fei. He's even roped in his ex-girlfriend Karen (Evonne Hsu), who's in charge of singing and dancing rehearsals. Will Super Seed win the competition? Probably, but even if they don't, I'm sure Hao Zi's growth as a person and as a musician is more of the selling point for this drama.\n\nOn a random note, K Song Lover is one of the silliest drama names I've ever heard. If you're wondering why... does it make you want to watch it? Exactly.\n\nBorrow Ur Love (借用一下你的愛) on CTV\n\nStarring: Amanda Chu, Dylan Kuo, Eli Shih, Cherry Hsia, Allen Chao, Linda Liu\n\nI'm surprised I haven't heard anything about this one, since I thought Amanda (The Fierce Wife) and Dylan (The Outsiders) were fairly well known. But maybe the stupid drama name scared people away. Seriously, I'm trying to decide which one's worse, this one or K Song Lover. I gotta say, though, the plot of Borrow Ur Love is certainly the most intriguing among the four in this post, but I guess that's not saying much.\n\nGeneral plot: Xie Ping'an (Amanda Chu) works for a lawyer hired by a gourmet street in a renowned shopping center. She's passionate and sincere and has a crush on one of her managers, Li Ziwen (Eli Shih). In a freak accident she bumps into Ye Chen (Dylan Kuo), a Brother Sharp sort of character who was recently released from prison, when she gets involved in a kidnapping of the shopping center president Bai Mingli (Linda Liu).\n\nLuckily, Ye Chen rescues both her and President Bai. As a result, he becomes President Bai's personal bodyguard, and he's also given the responsibility of finding her long-lost biological daughter. It also turns out that Ye Chen was childhood friends with Li Ziwen, and that they'd lived together during their high school years. When Ziwen accidentally murdered a hoodlum, Ye Chen took the fall for him but rejected all prison visits and didn't even tell his friend when he was released.\n\nZiwen, of course, is extremely grateful to his friend and finds a place for Ye Chen to live. Of course, since this is a drama, this happens to be the room next door to Xie Ping'an and her best friend Xie Xile! After an awkward shower scene (wait, is this Office Girls?), Ye Chen discovers that Ping'an has a crush on Ziwen, and he threatens to reveal her secret unless she prepares late-night snacks for him.\n\nAs Ye Chen searches for President Bai's daughter, President Bai also announces that she plans to get rid of the gourmet street in the shopping center. Ping'an offers to take on the case and ask President Bai for a favor, but she's rejected straight out, causing Ping'an to declare war against President Bai. At that time, Ye Chen discovers the whereabouts of President Bai's long-lost daughter, who was sent to the very orphanage that Ping'an and her roommate/bestie Xili grew up in, on the very same day that the two girls were sent there.\n\nA DNA test reveals that Ping'an is President Bai's biological daughter, and in a fit of over-protectiveness, President Bai thinks that the previous kidnapping was part of a larger conspiracy aiming to harm her daughter. In order to protect Ping'an, she plans to announce that Xili is her daughter. On the day of the announcement, which is on Valentine's Day, Ping'an discovers that Xili and Ziwen like each other. After President Bai announces that Xili is actually her daughter, Ping'an collapses inside, even though she keeps up a strong front and pretends that the person she likes is actually Ye Chen.\n\nAgain, this is a drama, so it turns out President Bai is suffering from a brain tumor. She wants Ye Chen to figure out who's behind the kidnapping conspiracy, and she says that she'll announce the truth about her daughter after that's all figured out. Ye Chen, who sees Ping'an as a stand-in for his younger sister and dearly loves her as a result, wants the damage done to Ping'an and to Xili to be lessened as much as possible, and thus he agrees to figure out who wants to hurt President Bai and her family. Once you borrow something, it's easy to borrow it again as long as you return it. But when you borrow someone's love, how do you return that?\n\nI probably won't be watching any of these, simply because I have too many other dramas to catch up on at the moment. But I may keep Borrow Ur Love in the back of my mind, and if people start raving about any of the others, I might give them a shot. But in the meantime, it is back to Swordman and Love Destiny (which is freakin' 86 episodes... arghhh) for me.\n\nThe idol band plot is becoming popular if it's even hit China. Last year, Korea had K-pop Ultimate Survival drama and now this, not to mention other dramas that revolve around idols or idol groups like Full House: Take 2 and of course the classic You're Beautiful.\n\nThere's a number of different manga/manhwa that revolves around idols, so I wouldn't be surprised to see more such dramas pop up.\n\nKing Flower sounds like it might be overbearingly cheesy and goofy, but I might try to watch an episode or two. Staying far away from twin dramas and Mike He. Similar to what you said, he's not a reason for me to watch a drama, with his questionable acting skills, without there being good actors, plot, etc. behind him.\n\nBorrow Your Love, hmm, I'll have to see if it's being subbed and I want to try Swordsman. I watched an episode of Beauties of the Emperor since it was on dramafever now, didn't care much for it, but it did put me in the mood to watch more c-dramas.\n\nLove Recipe? Which one is that? I remember a twdrama a while back called that. Any good?\n\nOops, I meant Love Destiny, not Love Recipe. (Gosh, these \"love\" names are driving me crazy.) Love Destiny is a currently airing cdrama that I am super behind on watching. Love Recipe was a really awful twdrama that I only tried watching because it had Rhydian Vaughan, but I only got through two episodes because of how bad it was. :|\n\nI was really surprised to see that DramaFever had licensed Beauties of the Emperor, but I guess they're expanding their Chinese-language repertoire. I doubt they'll sub Borrow Ur Love, though, since I'm pretty sure the only twdramas they do are the ones produced by SETTV.\n\nIf you're in the mood for cdramas, I'd definitely recommend checking out Swordman. It's not good by any stretch of the imagination, but it is ridiculously entertaining. :P Here's a website that has the first three episodes subbed: http://chenguangsorchard.blogspot.com/search/label/swordsman\n\nThanks for the helpful info. It's always nice to have another site to go to for subs.\n\nYeah, I'm glad to see Dramafever is expanding their repertoire. Knowing you'll get reliable (if not great subs), eventually is great. I'm still waiting for Japan to allow someone (anyone) to stream their dramas legally so we have options for that as well.\n\nI watched episode 1 of Swordsman, and like you said, it's definitely entertaining, even if the CG looks like its stuck in the 1990s. I also enjoyed the questioning of the girl about her clan's actions. Her character and Chen Qiao En's are the only ones that really look interesting so far.\n\nHeh, I was actually considering applying for one of DramaFever's translation jobs once I'm done with school, but then they took the job opening down. :( I guess they got swarmed with applications or something. I do find it surprising that jdramas haven't officially partnered with any streaming/subtitle sites yet. Maybe DramaFever will expand in that direction in the future?\n\nAhahaha, the CG in Swordman... Well, it's decent for the most part, but anything involving special-effect animals definitely looks outdated. There's one scene, where a monkey steals something from the main character, that's particularly laughable.\n\nI agree that Chen Qiao'en's character is one of the more interesting ones. In fact, you could probably argue that she's the main character in this adaptation... lol. I think it was stupid of Yu Zheng to change her character from a eunuch to a crossdressing girl, but if he was trying to up the romantic elements in this drama, it definitely worked.\n\nI did some skipping around in later episodes to try to figure out what happens to Chen Qiao En's character. It looks like she falls for Wallace's character, but does he like her back? Or does he like the other girl?\n\nInquiring mind wants to know please.\n\nI don't think Linghu Chong ever explicitly says he likes Dongfang Bubai. At one point he says she's in his heart or something like that, so that can kind of be interpreted as liking her back, except he's just too confused about the situation to really say so straight out. It doesn't help that there's one part where DFBB switches outfits with Ren Yingying (the other girl), which makes LHC think that the girl who healed him was DFBB, when actually it was RYY.\n\nHe's pretty straightforward about his love for Ren Yingying, though, so he definitely likes her. The situation with DFBB is a lot more complicated, but you could see it as he sort of likes her but isn't quite sure how to deal with such a relationship, so there's little chance of anything coming out of it.\n\nHey, I have just finished watching King Flower...\n\nPlease watch it immediately.. It's so damn good, especially with all the scenes of Chris Wu.\n\nHe nails it...\n\nI am now officially his number one fan.. :)"
