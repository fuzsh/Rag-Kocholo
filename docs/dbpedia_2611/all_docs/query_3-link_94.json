        "text": "Love Keeps Going (Template:Zh) is a 2011 Taiwanese drama starring Cyndi Wang, Mike He and Eli Shih. It is based on Taiwanese novel, Wang's Love Song (Template:Zh).\n\nIt was first broadcast in Taiwan on free-to-air China Television (CTV) from 5 June 2011, every Sunday at 22:00 to 23:30 and on cable TV Gala Television (GTV) Variety Show/CH 28 on 11 June 2011, every Sunday at 21:00 to 22:30. The premiere episode on CTV achieved an average rating of 1.84.[1]\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nTemplate:Cleanup rewrite\n\nZha Mei Le (Cyndi Wang) is illustrious, humble and hardworking. She is also well-behaved, obedient, caring and kind. Her vast collection of certificates (including IT expertise to a baking license) is a testament to her enthusiasm. Despite her faultless exterior, she hides a bittersweet past. An accidental incident of eavesdropping led her to discover that neither of her parents, while going through their divorce, wanted custody of her, purely due to her being stupid. As a result, she has since worked hard to develop skills, gaining love and approval in the process.\n\nHer boyfriend, Han Yi Feng (Eli Shih) still falls in love with her, as a result of her mass abilities and generous nature. His mother and sister both are impressed by and greatly admire her from the start of their relationship. Mei Le even helps achieve what she thinks is Yi Feng's dream of opening and running a bakery. There is a slight marring of this idyllic plot, with the introduction of Yi Feng's brother, the spoilt, rich and famous Han Yi Lie (Mike He). Mei Le makes a terrible first impression on him but she is determined to change that.\n\nAll seems well with the couple engaged to be married. However, in a cruel twist of fate, Yi Feng shows his true character and is not at all what Mei Le thought him to be. When she finds out that their relationship is not as pure as she thought it was, she is set with the difficult task of rediscovering herself, along with help, and in the process, learns to trust and fall in love again.\n\nCast[]\n\nActor Character Relationships Cyndi Wang Zha Mei Le (Template:Lang)/He Yan Qin 何言沁 Main character/younger sister of He Yan Shao (Template:Lang) Mike He Han Yi Lie (Template:Lang) Zha Mei Le (Template:Lang)'s later boyfriend, younger brother of Han Yi Feng (Template:Lang) Eli Shih Han Yi Feng (Template:Lang) Zha Mei Le (Template:Lang)'s original boyfriend, older brother of Han Yi Lie (Template:Lang) and Han Yi Fei (Template:Lang) Zhang Shan Wei Zha Yu Cheng (Template:Lang) Older brother of Zha Mei Le (Template:Lang) Albee Huang Han Yi Fei (Template:Lang) Younger sister of Han Yi Feng (Template:Lang) and Han Yi Lie (Template:Lang) Michelle Zhang Guo Xuan Xuan (Template:Lang) Bread shop assistant.
