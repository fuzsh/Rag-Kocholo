I was just randomly browsing but saw Penny’s post about this movie, and how she was telling us to watch and support her. (Click here for the movie’s Facebook page.) This was written and directed by Alice Wang in 2015. (Go here for the article.) Supposedly, this is a story focused on women and their livelihood and the struggles they faced.

Penny’s character was A Qin (阿勤). Her character was both righteous and loyal.

Other female leads in here included Candy Wang (王奕瑾), Lene Lai (賴琳恩), and Francesca Kao (高慧君). The male leads consisted of Duan Jun Hao (段鈞豪) and Wang Xiang Yu (王翔宇).
