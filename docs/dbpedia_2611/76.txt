Dandelion Love was 40 episodes long, but it definitely could have been only 30. The last ten episodes really dragged. Overall, the acting in the drama is not very good. I love me some Danson Tang, but he didn’t do a good job in this drama, and don’t even get me started on Alice Tseng. Both her acting and her character were irritating. The two best actors, who played the two most interesting characters, were Lene Lai and Nylon Chen. I thought they played their roles very well, even if it took Nylon a few episodes to truly become comfortable playing someone who couldn’t speak. Oh, and side note: these two are married in real life!! I also thought the main character’s father (Weng Jia Ming) did a good job.

The plot of the drama was a simple love story/slice of life. The way the plot developed in many parts, especially the way Lena Lai’s character developed, was sloppy. SPOILERS: When I didn’t even feel sad that one of the main characters had died, I knew there was something wrong. That being said, I still watched the whole thing, and it certainly wasn’t torture. The first seven or so episodes with the kids were entertaining, and the love stories were sweet as well.

Watch If: You’re a fan of Danson Tang (he was the reason I started watching), Lene Lai, or Nylon Chen. Also, if you like longer dramas that take you beyond marriage and happily-ever-after, then this might be a drama you’ll enjoy.

Don’t Watch If: You want an emotional drama that really makes you connect with the characters. Also, if you struggle watching dramas over 20 episodes, then I wouldn’t suggest this drama for you.

Overall Score: 5.25
