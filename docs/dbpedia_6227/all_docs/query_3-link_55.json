Mount Olive was the second-highest in the conference with student-athletes named to the All-Academic Team.\n\nStudent-Athletes must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or higher on a 4.0 scale to be eligible. The GPA is calculated based on the student-athlete's cumulative average through the previous semester and each student-athlete must have attended their member institution for at least one academic year. Academic All-Conference Teams are comprised of juniors and seniors who play in one of Conference Carolinas' twenty two sponsored sports.\n\nBelow are the men's and women's student-athletes that were named to this year's respective teams."
