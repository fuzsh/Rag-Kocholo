        "text": "Children often go in the footsteps of their star parents. The road to Hockey for Alexander Ragulin, the son of the famous Soviet hockey player was open, but he chose another way. Contrary to the desires of parents, Alexander Jr. became an actor and a singer, his creative career just begins.\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nAlexander Ragulin-Jr. - Son of the famous Soviet hockey player Alexander Ragulin. Judging by the official biography of the Great Athlete, at the time of his son, he was official marriage with Lyudmila Karaush, which divorced in the late 80s. The mother of the boy was Natalia Nikolaevna Orlova, therefore, Alexander - the extramarital son athlete. Sasha has a consolidated brother for Father, Anton Ragulin.\n\nAlexander Ragulin\n\nFull Alexander Ragulin was born in Moscow in 1981, up to 24 years old wore the name Mom - Orlov. Despite the fact that parental relationships were not registered, the father took an active part in the life of the Son. He dreamed of giving him to hockey, Mom - on volleyball, but Sasha chose football. Alone, not reporting related links with hockey player, the boy passed the selection in Sports CSKA, played the team under 14, where the captain was.\n\nBy these years, Sasha realized that he did not make success, he did not quite sports. In an interview, he said that maybe he would continue to play sports, but he did not have such a coach as. Sport biography The young men ended up.\n\nAlexander's mother worked in the General Staff and dreamed to be the Son to become a military. After graduating from School, Ragulin-Jr. enters the Cherepovetsky Military Engineering Institute of Radio Electronics. In addition to studying there, he plays all five years in the local KVN team.\n\nAfter receiving the lieutenant stars and distribution back to the capital Ragulin parallel to the service continued to engage in creativity. Alexander entered the music school in the class of vocal. Having received the title of senior lieutenant, the young man clearly realized that his vocation was to be an artist.\n\nRegarding such a decision, the famous father called the Son of the Cranc on the letter \"M\": in his opinion, the officer had to defend his homeland. But Alexander-younger firmly decided to change his profession, and he could not leaving his mother's epaulets, nor father.\n\nAfter the death of Pope, Alexander took his name, resigned from the army and entered the guitis - the military unit was extremely surprised, Mom - a little disappointed. After military wages, the scholarship seemed a tiny, but financial position began to stabilize after the first roles.\n\nMusicals and films\n\nThe actor received the first role in the musical \"Scarlet Sails\" - Gray in Him saw Borodin A. V., in whose workshop, Alexander received an education. Together with the role, confidence came in tomorrow: Ragulin began to invite to episodic roles, then in the musical \"Ordinary Miracle.\" Alexander participated in the TV project \"Find a monster\" - a show in the format of casting, which released TV Center TV channel.\n\nThanks to the musical talent, Alexander was invited to a leading actor in a successful Music \"Count Orlov\", in which it still is busy. The actor remembers that as soon as he saw the announcement of a passing casting on the project, immediately went to him. The surname of Orlov is directly connected with Alexander, because with her he lived almost a quarter of a century.\n\nIn 2013, the artistic film \"Legend №17\" came out on TV screens, where Alexander played the great defender Alexander Pavlovich Ragulin, his father. After the premiere of the film \"Legend №17\", Vladimir Tretyak specially visited the performance of \"Count Orlov\" to personally admit to Ragulina, how touched it the film and the image created by the son of a hockey player.\n\nPersonal life\n\nPersonal life actor does not hide, but does not advertise. It is known that he is happy in marriage, with his wife Olga Azhaza met while studying in Gitis. Young people were busy in some performances, sang in musical duets and did not notice how friendship turned into love.\n\nAlexander first admitted in his feelings: came up to the girl and said that she was ready to live with her and give birth to children. Olga thought for several days, agreed. Three months later, the lovers were signed, in 2012 they had a son Yegor. The boy grows strong, sports, Alexander plans to give it to hockey. But not upset, even if the son decides, for example, embroider with a cross.\n\nAlexander wanted to attend childbirth, but because of a manic desire to make his contribution to any case, it was decided to leave him at home, otherwise he would have helped the obstetrics. In the morning, he took his wife to the hospital, and before the evening play on the phone, the father heard the baritone of the newborn son.\n\nAlexander's family lives on principle, looking at each other, but in one direction. Ragulin and Azhazha - like-minded people, with the same interests and hobbies. Family couple is glad when it turns out to be in one project, play and sing together.\n\nAlexander Ragulin now\n\nIn 2018, the \"First Channel\" successfully passed the multi-veneer, where Alexander played Efim's headman. The actor managed to be impossible: play a negative character endowered with its truth, which is understandable to the viewer. The fans of the project allocate Ragulin as one of the most chaismatic and bright participants in the picture.\n\nIn addition to filming and musicals, Alexander Ragulin earns on corporate events and celebrations, writing scenarios, songs and congratulations. An important place in his life is a family: with his wife and son, he tries to spend every free minute.\n\nAlexander adheres to the opinion that smartphones and social networks make people hostage progress, we do not have time for more useful interests. It is probably why his page in \"Instagram\" is replenished extremely rarely. In the last post, he in the video with the son of Egor congratulates all women from March 8.\n\nMusicla and filmography\n\n2009 - the film \"Ivan Grozny\"\n\n2010 - Music \"Ordinary Miracle\"\n\n2011 - the film \"Northern Wind\"\n\n2012 - Musical \"Count Orlov\"\n\n2013 - The film \"Legend №17!\"\n\n2013 - Series \"Real Guys\"\n\n2014 - Music \"Oliver Twist\"\n\n2016 - Movie \"Poor People\"\n\n2017 - film \"Lev Yashin. Goalkeeper of my dreams \"\n\n2018 - TV series \"Filter Gremota\"\n\nOn May 5, one of the legendary Soviet hockey players was born Alexander Ragulin. He entered the story not only with his brilliant game on ice, but also by won the maximum hockey game collection of medals of the Olympic Games, World Championships and Europe. Their Alexander has 22.\n\nGolden Boy\n\nHis first victory in the Winter Olympics took place in Innsbruck. In 1964, Ragulin was included in the symbolic national team of the Olympic Games. Four years later, the Soviet hockey player felt the \"taste\" of the Olympic gold at the tournament in Grenoble.\n\nAlexander first among the Soviet players reached the status of a tenfold world champion. But the victories could be more at least two. But the world championships 1961 and 1972 ended for the USSR team bronze and silver, respectively, which at that time was regarded as a failure. And if you consider that from 1961 to 1965, the World Championships were held every two years, and not every season, as now, the \"affected\" ragulin medals becomes even more.\n\nTo the gold of the Olympic Games and World Cup, the hockey player added nine at the European Championships and the Soviet Union as part of the Great CSKA.\n\nPartners in the club and the national team remembered Alexander with a friendly and peaceful man. But it is noted that when Ragulina was droked, they provoked it on ice - it is in response with a double energy put the intruder in the corner of the ice box.\n\nHockey Chemistry\n\nAlexander Pavlovich Ragulin was born on May 5, 1941 in the family of famous architects. But along the path of the parents, despite their desire, the boy went categorically refused. His heart since childhood got sick.\n\nIn hockey, like most of the famous athletes, Alexander fell by chance. The first steps on Ice Alexander Ragulin began to do in the school team. There he played with his brothers - Anatoly and Mikhail. Thanks Nikolay EpsteinHonored Coach of the USSR, Alexander Ragulin became even more interested in hockey. At the invitation of Epstein, the young athlete was in the Resurrection \"Chemist\".\n\nAlready in the first official matches, Ragulin was highlighted with powerful dimensions, so that the rivals could not bother with it. Alexander's branded game manifested itself in an excellent vision of the site and accurate transmissions, heavy duty throw.\n\nVyacheslav Fetisov (right) presents the national sports premium \"Glory\" in the nomination \"Legend\" famous hockey player Alexander Ragulina. Moscow, 2004. Photo: RIA Novosti / Vladimir Fedorenko\n\nLong to keep such a hockey player in a mediocre team it was impossible. And in 1962, a significant moment occurred in Alexander's life: he was invited to CSKA - the strongest club of that time. Like most hockey players, who were crossing the \"Army\", Alexander immediately received a challenge to the national team of the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the World Championships and Olympiad, Ragulin surprised rivals with a great organization of the game. He has established himself with a hockey player who simulated the actions of the entire team. Partners called Alexander respectfully - San Palych. He helped them to feel confidence in their abilities. In addition, Ragulin possessed a naked little, and this ability dramatically distinguished him from other defenders.\n\nOn the way to the third Olympic Gold\n\nAlexander Ragulin received the first individual award at the 1966 World Championships. San Palych scored six points and ahead of the statistics of the legendary Anatoly Firsovaand Boris Majorova. Thus, Alexander was awarded the awards \"Best Protector of the Tournament\".\n\nIn the short list of significant victories of Ragulin, his last 1972 Olympics is a mansion. It was in Sapporo, Alexander Pavlovich won the third Olympic Gold. It should be emphasized that Ragulin, as well as the current president of the Federation Hockey Federation Vladislav Tretyak,have an equal number of titles on world championships.\n\n\"We drove in Sapporo only for gold, and it seems to me that if the Canadians were even played, then we would still become the first. Very strong and balanced we had a team. We were ready to beat absolutely all. In the same 1972, we proved that in hockey, it is able to play not only in Canada, but also in the USSR, and no worse, \"recalled later Ragulin.\n\nOn matches with the participation of San Palycha Ice Arena were filled with thousands of spectators. IN North Americawhere he was afraid like fire, the Russian received the nickname \"Big Rag\".\n\nWith hockey in life\n\nAfter completing the career, Alexander Ragulin was headed as a children-youth school CSKA as a coach. He also worked at the Novosibirsk Club SKA. But on the bridge at the legendary defender it turned worse than on the site.\n\nIn 1997, he was introduced to the Hall of Glory IIHF, and at the beginning of the XXI century he was elected president of sports public organization \"Hockey veterans.\" Ragulin worked as part of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation physical culture and sport. In 2001, San Palycha solemnly awarded the highest award of the IOC - Olympic Order, and in two years he was recognized as a laureate of the National Sports Prize \"Glory\" in the nomination \"Legend\". In 2004, he was elected to the Hall of Fame of Family Hockey.\n\nThe Great Hockey player died in the Burdenko hospital on the night of November 18, 2004. Was buried at the Vagankovsky cemetery.\n\nBut the memory of him will remain in the centuries. In 2013, the Russian feature film was published - \"Legend number 17\". In the center of the narration, of course, not Ragulin, but it also appears in the script. Interestingly, the role of San Palycha performed his son Alexander Ragulin Jr. Like the father once, San Sanych did not go along the path of his parents. In sports, he did not find a seat. But he was submitted to the stage of the theater - he became a wonderful actor. Now it remains to wait leading role - In the film about the Father.\n\nAlexander Pavlovich Ragulin Born in Moscow for a month and a half before the start of the Great Patriotic War, May 5, 1941. The boy appeared not alone - almost simultaneously saw the world of his brother - Anatoly and Mikhail. Troyashki became a surprise for the famous architects of Pavel Nikolayevich and Sofia Viktorovna Ragulin, but even more surprise were their physical development. Since childhood, the boys were slender, and the mother was very worried about their health. Having encountered in the evacuation of the famous Leonid Utusov, Sophia Ragulina recognized the artist and approached him to say hello. Talking, the woman showed him his children and appeased on their hoodoobu. \"Do not worry, the healthy will be,\" the cliffs answered her and as if she looked into the water. Subsequently, it became obvious that the Ragulins brothers would be real heroes, those on whom the Russian land holds.\n\nThe brothers went similar ways, but to different purposes. Anatoly Pavlovich was an instructor of sports, a master of sports of an international class, a well-deserved coach of the USSR. For a long time led classes in the cosmonaut detachment. Mikhail Pavlovich faded Flvorball, became a master in this sport. But Alexander Pavlovich pretended to the \"Ice Fighter\" career. And did not lose.\n\nAlexander Ragulin won the highest among all hockey players the number of medals (27) on Olympic Games, World and European Championships.\n\nTRERKTROY olympic champion (1964, 1968, 1972), 10-fold world champion (1963-71, 1973), 9-fold champion in Europe (1963-70, 1973) and the USSR (1963-66, 1968, 1970-73), the best defender of the championship Mira 1966, Member of the Legendary Super Series of the USSR - Canada in 1972. The second winner of the World Cup 1972, the third winner of the CM-1961. Silver winner of the USSR Championships 1967, 1969. In the team, CSKA defeated the European Champions Cup draw in 1969-73.\n\nIn the USSR Championships Ragulin played 427 matches and scored 63 washers. At the World Championships, Europe and the Olympic Games in the composition of the USSR national team held 102 matches, scored 14 washers.\n\nAll three brothers who have been learning in the 51st Moscow School, referred a great future in music. Hockey for them for a long time was only a hobby, they played for the school team, and the main events of their life at the time took place on stage. Sasha studied to play at the double bass, tolya - on the piano, and Misha - on the cello. Moreover, all three perfectly painted, and the teachers celebrated all certain abilities to painting. This is how fully confirmed the proverb that a talented man is talented in everything. And who knows, perhaps the world would also hear about the great double bassist Alexander Ragulin, if not Nikolai Semenovich Epsteinwho finally took the magnificent three to hockey space. Interestingly, the guys were in the same plane, but in different positions: Senior Anatoly became a goalkeeper, Alexander - Defender, and Mikhail - Forward.\n\nThe brothers fell into the Resurrection \"Chemist\", which has long been famous for its technical and plastic hockey. The power game Ragulin was not necessary to study - the mighty dimensions allowed them to easily click any rivals as fried seeds, but the brilliant possession of the technique and the \"smart\" game was a visiting card Alexander. In addition, Ragulina-average featured softness and accuracy of gear, as well as a throw of incredible power. It was him in 1962 he was invited to CSKA and the national team of the Soviet Union, which predetermined his fate until the end of life.\n\nAt the World Championships and Olympic Games, the rivals immediately turned their attention on the overall defender, winning every collision. He surprised not only his physique, but also a brilliant organization of the game. San Palych, as it (despite the young age) called the team's partners, literally in grains built the actions of the entire team. He was, as it were now called, a dispatcher with a brilliant vision of a platform and an extreme passage. And the imperturbability of Ragulin became the arrival in the towns. If other legendary defenders - Eduard Ivanov or Nikolay Sologubov - turned his comrades with his charismaticity and excitement, Ragulin instilled confidence and calm in them. Such a subtle feeling of the head attack at that time, perhaps, there was no defender. It was apparently the music school, where the proverb about patience and labor is most relevant.\n\nUnlike many modern \"heavyweights\", Alexander Pavlovich's Tafgai peavilovich also did not and in risen. He was peaceful, benevolent, did not bother anyone in life or ice arena. But if someone in inexperience or nonsense tried to rush to him or tie a fight, he simply clap off the offender in the corner of the site, so so that he crackled not only the equipment, but also Rybra.\n\nIt is also worth noting the usefulness of Ragulin in the attack. At the 1966 World Championship, the Soviet defender scored 6 (4 + 2) points, ahead of glasses, for example, the legendary striker Anatoly Firsova, and on the goals - even Boris Majorova. It is not surprising that it was Alexander Pavlovich who received a prime a better defender of the tournament.\n\nAmong all the awards of one of the most titled people in the history of hockey, you need to highlight it last Olympiad. - Sapporo-72. It is on these games Ragulin (along with Vitaly Davydov, Viktor Kuzkina and Anatoly Firsov) got his third olympic gold. Subsequently, this record was not able to beat anyone, although the list of three-time champions were added Vladislav Treyk and Andrey Khomutov. But according to the number of titles at the World Championships, Alexander Pavlovich and Vladislav Alexandrovich holds dual leadership - they have such trophies of 10.\n\n\"In Sapporo, we went only for gold, and it seems to me that if the Canadians were even played, then we would still become the first. Very strong and balanced we had a team. We were ready to beat absolutely all. In the same 1972, we proved that in hockey, not only in Canada can play, but also in the USSR, and no worse\"He said about the Olympics and the legendary USSR Super Series - Canada, which also took part.\n\nThe authority of Ragulin in the national team and the club was uninterrupted. More experienced players of CSKA and the National Team addressed to another young and green sachets for the resolution of internal conflicts. If with a question for any reason it was impossible to approach the coach, the hockey players went to the smart, educated, who had a thin felt fee of the Palych, which became for them with a certain \"last instance\" over time. His life experience, the right view of the problems and congenital kindness kept the family situation in the team, which many years have revived the current national team mentors - Bykov and Zakharkin.\n\nUnlike the world's undervalued goalkeeper Viktor Konovalenko, Iichf more than once recognized Ragulin with the best defender of the planet, noting his vision of the game and extraordinary composure. It was known far beyond the countries of the socialist. On games with the participation of \"Big Rag\" (as they were called in North America) thousands of spectators gathered, and even after the completion of Career, San Palych traveled with the command of veterans in many ways, sometimes not at all hockey countries. For example, in South Africa (yes, you did not hear!) He was met with love and joy. Even in this African Power, many have heard of the great Soviet hockey player.\n\nLeaving Loda, Ragulin became a coach in the children-youth school CSKA, she worked for some time in Novosibirsk SKA and took the most active part in the life of the All-Russian Club young hockey players \"Golden washer.\" IN last years He participated in working with veterans of domestic hockey: He was the president of the regional sports public organization \"Veterans Hockey\", he worked as part of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation in physical culture and sports.\n\nThe Great Hockey player died on the night of November 18, 2004 in the Burdenko Hospital, and was buried in Moscow at the Vagankovsky cemetery. For many years in the city of Sud Vladimir region Annual Alexander Ragulin tournament is held, and since 2004, the memory of the famous hockey player is held.\n\n\"Hockey is a performance ... Hockey lovers come to the Palace of Sports because they are interested in performance on ice. Agree that the real fan worries not only the number of heads, but also how they were clogged, as the game was played, as teams played. I sought joy in hockey ...\",\" said Alexander Pavlovich somehow. We hope he found that he was looking for.

Son, Ragulin Anton Aleksandrovich (1969 year.), - Entrepreneur. Granddhack - Ragulina Victoria Antonovna (1997.Rezh.) And Ragulina Ekaterina Antonovna (2000 years.).\n\nFor a month and a half before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, three twins were born at one Muscovite. They were called Tolery, Sasha and Misha. The war began. Sophia Viktorovna - so called the woman - left with children in evacuation in Kemerovo. Once, putting sons in homemade sledges, she went out into the street. Male passed by.\n\nSorry, I seem to you, I learned, \"Muscovite himself took him. -You Leonid Osipovich Rockov?\n\nYes it's me. I arrived at concerts with your orchestra.\n\nMeet: My Gemini. How do you find them? Aren't they thin?\n\nDo not worry. They will grow up - the healthy will be, - answered the cliffs. - After all, I am also twin, I have a sister!\n\nThe great master of the Soviet pop was not mistaken - the twins really became healthy. They knew the entire hockey world - the Ragulins brothers! Especially succeeded by Alexander - three-time Olympic champion, 10-fold world champion, 9-fold European champion, 9-fold USSR champion!\n\nAlexander, a student of the 51st school of the Frunzensky district of Moscow, referred, as well as his brothers, a big future, but not on the ice site, although the twins have played successfully for the school team (in the Frunzensky district they knew the MTS hockey players, as Misha called Misha, Tol, and Sasha Ragulina), \"they successfully engaged in the district music school: Sasha in the class of double bass, Tolya - Piano, Misha - Cello. Eyewitnesses say that at that time somehow it was not believed that Ragulins would be preassed on the ice platform more than on stage.\n\nFrom the hugs of the music of Alexander Ragulin, as well as his two twin brothers (all the success was predicted not only in music, but also in painting), Nikolai Semenovich Epstein in the world of hockey. Anatoly, born 15 minutes earlier than everyone, became a goalkeeper, Alexander - Defender, Mikhail, the youngest, - attackers.\n\nThen in the team \"Chemist\", where Ragulins got, not in honor there was a proverb \"The power is - the mind is not necessary.\" Accordingly, in Voskresensk, young and taught. So Sasha was added to the hectares of the nature of the weather, and excellent ownership of technique, and addiction to the game devoid of straightness.\n\nThe softness and seittences of the gear, a powerful and accurate throw - all this quickly allocated Alexander Ragulin, which in 1962 was almost simultaneously invited to CSKA and included in the USSR national team (his two brothers entered the army club a year later) not only among the defenders, but also among attackers. For example, at the World Cup and Europe and Europe, 1966, held in Ljubljana, this hockey player \"Goal + Paz\" bypassed (4 + 2) the famous striker Anatoly Firsov (3 + 2), and on abandoned washers - even Boris Majorov himself The account of which turned out to be three accurate gets. At that tournament, Ragulin was called the best defender of the planet.\n\nNo matter how the rivals of the USSR national team at the World and Europe championships, in the Olympic Games, could not Munya Alexander Ragulin. And every collision ended with him the same thing - the attack chose!\n\nPossessing a powerful physique, Palych (or San Palych), as it always, despite the young age, was called in CSKA and the USSR national team, did not build its game only on the powerful martial arts and the fulfillment of purely destructive functions. Excellent platform vision, deposited technique, calm and prudence allowed Ragulin to be a true design designer. Having mastered the washer, he immediately substituted Paz directed partners in the attack.\n\nPerhaps Ragulin was not on ice so excited as, say, Edward Ivanov, but before Nikolai Sologubov, but no one from the defenders at that time had a Ragulin's subtle calculation, combined with extraordinary composure.\n\nAlexander Ragulin was not Grubian. On the contrary, goodwill has always proceeded from him. He gave back to hockey hooligans in his own way: he squeezed somewhere in the corner of the site at the side of the side of Other in his arms, but so that Grubian, the scent of the hit terrible defender, began to crack the bones inside hockey armor.\n\nIn many countries of the world, the audience, barely hesing about the arrival of the USSR team (in our days Ragulin, at the head of the team of veterans, often turns out to be abroad. Including, which seemed to be from Hockey South Africa), it was specially walked to look at Alexander Pavlovich.\n\nIf in the command of CSKA sometimes there were internal conflicts, then the parties went beyond their resolution to Palych. The coaches when they needed to determine the measure of punishment for those who guessed, turned to the same Palych. He was always a kind of last authority, this officer, once, like two twin brothers, finished the Moscow Regional Pedagogical Institute.\n\nLeaving ice, Ragulin became a coach in the children-youth school CSKA. By the way, his appearance at one time in CSKA took advantage of all: the hockey player, the Army Club and the USSR national team. Ragulin worked as a coach in Novosibirsk SKA. And today he \"taxes\" all veterans of the domestic hockey.\n\nAlexander Pavlovich Ragulin was awarded the Order of the Labor Red Banner, two orders of the \"Honor Sign\", the Order of Honor."
