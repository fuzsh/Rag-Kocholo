        "text": "On February 1, 1948 in the second national championship, CDKA defeated Krylia Sovetov 8:1 in front of 10 thousand spectators at Dynamo Stadium. Four goals were scored by Vsevolod Bobrov, who had missed most of the previous season, two by Evgeny Babich, one by Army playing coach Anatoly Tarasov, and one by Vladimir Venyovtsev. At the end of the derby, Army club defender Vladimir Menshikov was disqualified for one month for hitting an opponent.\n\nOn this day in 1955, the Army team scored one goal without response in each period against the reigning national champions, their countrymen from Dynamo (3:0). They were scored by Ivan Tregubov, Viktor Shuvalov and Vladimir Brunov.\n\nOn February 1, 1961 in Voskresensk near Moscow, CSKA led by Alexander Vinogradov broke the resistance of Khimik - 4:1. Veniamin Aleksandrov hit twice the Anatoliy Ragulin’s goal and was supported by Konstantin Loktev and Igor Dekonskiy.\n\nTwo years later, in Kalinin (Tver), the Army team from Moscow, which was trying to regain the league title, thrashed their farm outfit SKA 9:1. Firsov scored a double, Aleksandrov, Yury Moiseev, Valentin Senyushkin, Volkov, Almetov, Dekonsky and Vladimir Brezhnev each scored a goal. SKA (Kalinin) finished in tenth place among the twenty participants of the 1962/1963 championship, ahead of Chelyabinsk \"Traktor\".\n\nOn that day, at the 1964 Olympics in Innsbruck, the USSR national team backed by the Army team from Moscow thrashed the Swiss team 15:0. Defender Eduard Ivanov scored a double, as was done also by Alexander Ragulin, Konstantin Loktev, Veniamin Alexandrov, Leonid Volkov, and Anatoly Firsov who turned 23 that day.\n\nOn February 1, 1967, our team in its Ice Palace on Leningrad Avenue made a dozen scores in the goal of Minsk \"Torpedo\", while conceding four, all in the second period (12:4). They were scored by Vikulov (3), Anatoly Ionov (2), Viktor Yeremin (2), Firsov, Almetov, Brezhnev, Aleksandrov, Moiseyev. Loktev who previously finished his career came out on the ice. Coach Tarasov brought him back to the team that had lost the lead to Spartak.\n\nOn the same day in 1970, CSKA defeated Traktor 5:2 in the home game. The young unit of Yuri Lebedev - Vyacheslav Anisin - Alexander Bodunov had a big game for the winners, scoring two goals. Bodunov opened the scoring, while Anisin scored the winning goal. Viktor Polupanov, Mishakov and Firsov also scored.\n\nIn 1972 in Sapporo, our national team had a good training while playing with West German stickhandler before the Olympic Games. Firsov's poker, double of Vladimir Petrov, goals by Boris Mikhailov, Vladimir Lutchenko and Yevgeny Mishakov helped to defeat the opponent 14:1. Valery Kharlamov came on the ice with Firsov and Vladimir Vikulov, while Yury Blinov played with Petrov and Mikhailov.\n\nOn February, 1, 1973 the Army team defeated \"Traktor\" with double-digit score 10:4, but lost the first period 1:2. Vikulov scored a hat trick, Mikhailov and Petrov doubled; players who also distinguished themselves were Kharlamov, captain of the team Viktor Kuzkin, and newcomer Vladimir Gostyuzhev, for whom this was his first hit in a CSKA uniform.\n\nThree years later, on the eve of the Olympics in Innsbruck, the Red Machine had its last readiness test. Their opponent - Austrian club Fillacher SV - featured seven players from our team, including the trio of Mikhailov - Petrov - Kharlamov, and defenseman Alexander Gusev. The Soviet team had broken the resistance of the home team only in the third period - 11:7. Boris Alexandrov, Gennady Tsygankov, Viktor Zhluktov scored for the winners, while Kharlamov (twice), Mikhailov, Petrov, and Gusev scored for the losers.\n\nOn that day in 1977 in Luzhniki, CSKA regained the Soviet championship de facto, scored seven goals without response against Khimik, which goal was defended by Alexander Pashkov. Petrov and Alexander Volchkov each made two scores; Gennady Tsygankov, Mikhailov and Anisin made one each.\n\nOn February 1, 1981, in Minsk, the Army team played their second game against the domestic Dynamo. The day before, the home team was defeated 3:9, now 1:6. By the second break, though, the ice was tied 1:1. Petrov (twice), Kharlamov, Aleksander Lobanov, Viktor Zhluktov and Vladimir Krutov scored.\n\nA year later, CSKA let victory over Dynamo slip away in the penultimate minute in Luzhniki in their 2:2 derby. Alexei Kasatonov and Krutov put our team ahead, but the white-and-blues managed to pull ahead.\n\nOn February 1, 1986 in Setun, CSKA as the leader and national champion had no problem defeating \"Traktor\" 7:1. No one was surprised by the goals of KLM: Krutov had a double, Makarov had a goal, and neither was surprised by the goals hit by experienced champions Irek Gimaev and Andrei Khomutov. Young Igor Vyazmikin, Evgeny Davydov and especially 17-year-old Pavel Kostichkin delighted the visitors with their irresistible shots. Junior defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, who further will win a gold medal at the World Championships in April, played at the center-forward position.\n\nOn that day, before departing to Canada for the 1988 Olympics, the Red Machine played the first of two test matches against Finland. The game in Joensu was a 5:5 draw. In the third period our team was trailing 2:5, but scored three goals through the efforts of Sergey Makarov, Vyacheslav Fetisov and Igor Larionov. The first two goals were scored by Vyacheslav Bykov and 18-year-old Alexander Mogilny. Yevgeny Belosheikin defended the first two periods, failing four shots.\n\nIn 1991, in Luzhniki, our team had to catch up with Torpedo Yaroslavl three times and ended up tied 3:3. The team’s youth was especially distinguished by Igor Malykhin, his namesake Chibirev and Pavel Bure, who tied the game 32 seconds before the final siren.\n\nOn February 1, 1999 in the CSKA Ice Palace, the hosts lost 2:3 to Torpedo Yaroslavl in the penultimate minute of the game. Our team managed to level the score twice through the efforts of Yegor Mikhailov and newly crowned youth world champion Alexander Zevakhin. In March these rivals will meet in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nExactly ten years later, in their first KHL season, CSKA lost 0:2 to HC MVD in Balashikha, missing both goals in the first five minutes. A year later these rivals will cross sticks in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nOn February 1, 2011 in Riga our team heroically defended the advantage obtained in the first period against Dynamo from Latvia. Goals by captain Nikolai Pronin and Denis Parshin gave CSKA a 2:1 win.\n\nOn this day in 2013, CSKA led by Vyacheslav Butsaev, who replaced Valery Bragin at the helm, defeated Spartak 4:2 in front of a packed stands at the Sports Palace on Leningradsky Prospect. Brothers Alexander and Igor Radulov were distinguished: the younger scored 4 (1+3) points, the older 2 (1+1). The winning goal was scored by defenseman Yakov Rylov, one more puck was scored by Niklas Persson. After the derby, a fan war broke out on the grounds adjacent to the CSKA Sports Complex, culminating in numerous detentions of fans by police.\n\nOn February 1, 2015 in Ufa, regular-season leader CSKA was stronger than Salavat Yulaev, 2:1. Jan Mursak opened the scoring when his team was short-handed, and Alexander Radulov brought the victory.\n\nTwo years later in Chelyabinsk, CSKA suffered its last loss of the regular season to Traktor, 3:4. That local setback was followed by a nine-game winning streak that spanned the entire first round of the playoffs and the opening game of the second round."
