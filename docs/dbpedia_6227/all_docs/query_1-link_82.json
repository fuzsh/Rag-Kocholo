This diverse range of images includes official posters for the Summer and Winter Games set in their historical context, and linked to pervading themes such as politics, commerce, the Olympic symbols, cultural and physical diversity, and urban regeneration.\n\n4795.00 руб.*\n\nBeijing 798: Reflections On Art, Architecture And Society In China\n\nBook Description Beijing 798 is a study in contrast--one location, two milieu, fifty years apart. Reflecting on art, architecture, and society, the images and texts in this book offer a microcosm of the radical social and cultural changes that haveswept through Beijing (and for that matter China) over the last 50 years. East German-designed military factory turned contemporary art and culture center, Beijing 798 is captured in 200 vintage black and white images of the industrial space and its programs at the height of the revolutionary milieu of the 1950s, and also through an equal number of color photographs of a radically different milieu--50 years later in the present. In the contrasting images of the past--model workers, Great Leap Forward parades, East German state visits, Big Character Posters --and today's images--contemporary art exhibitions, rock and roll concerts, artist studios, galleries, and restaurants--this book bears witness to the birth and becoming...\n\n2866.00 руб.*\n\nSusan Brownell\n\nBeijing's Games: What the Olympics Mean to China\n\nWhy is hosting the Olympic Games so important to China? What is the significance of a quintessential symbol of Western civilization taking place in the heart of the Far East? Will the Olympics change China, or will China change the Olympics? Susan Brownell sets the historical and cultural contexts for the 2008 Beijing Olympics Games by placing it within the context of China's hundred-year engagement with the Olympic movement to illuminate what the Games mean to China and what the Beijing Olympic Games will mean for China's relationship with the outside world. Brownell's deeply informed analysis ranges from nineteenth-century orientalism to Cold War politics and post-Cold War China bashing. Drawing on her more than two decades of engagement in Chinese sports, the author presents evocative stories and first-person accounts to paint a human picture of the passion that many Chinese people feel for the Olympic Games. It will also be essential reading for journalists and sports enthusiasts...\n\n2239.00 руб.*\n\nLillian M. Li, Alison Dray-Novey, Haili Kong\n\nBeijing: From Imperial Capital to Olympic City\n\nFew world cities have a record as long, as fascinating, or as well-documented as Beijing's. A capital almost continuously for more than a thousand years, the city has been Khubilai Khan's Mongol headquarters, home to emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the main stage for Communist-era achievements and upheavals. \"Beijing\" is the first book in English to trace this vibrant city's history from its earliest days to the present. It highlights recent changes in the city as its more than fifteen million people live through record-level economic growth and intensive preparations for the 2008 Olympics. Focusing on the lives of ordinary residents and rulers alike, the authors examine the controversial destruction of historic districts as well as the construction of new residential and business districts and Olympic venues. Extensive photographs and paintings, many not previously published, offer a window onto Beijing not only in major phases of its past, but also in its startlingly...\n\n3136.00 руб.*\n\nTom Caraccioli and Jerry Caraccioli\n\nBoycott: Stolen Dreams of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games\n\nWith a thorough exploration of the political climate of the time and the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, this book describes the repercussions of Jimmy Carter's American boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. Despite missing the games they had trained relentlessly to compete in, many U.S. athletes went on to achieve remarkable successes in sports and overcame the bitter disappointment of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity dashed by geopolitics. Издание на английском языке.\n\n3628.00 руб.*\n\nAndrew Podnieks\n\nCanada's Olympic Hockey History, 1920-2010: Officially Licensed by Hockey Canada and Hockey Hall of Fame\n\nHockey made its Olympic debut at the 1920 games in Antwerp. Canada’s lopsided victories on their way to the gold medal — 15-0 over Czechoslovakia, a 12-1 shellacking of Sweden — set the stage for what was to become a decades-long dominance. This book documents each Olympic appearance in exciting detail, complete with extensive archival photography and personal player accounts.\n\n2852.00 руб.*\n\nJennifer Sey\n\nChalked Up: Inside Elite Gymnastics' Merciless Coaching, Overzealous Parents, Eating Disorders, and Elusive Olympic Dreams\n\n\"Sey writes of her career in internationally competitive gymnastics, which culminated when she won the 1986 U.S. national championship at age 17. From the start Sey was an underdog, ever the second-best athlete on the team hoping to prove herself with tenacity and toughness. She endured numerous injuries - including a broken femur, which could have ended her career - as well as an eating disorder, depression, isolation and tremendous strain on her family. With each new sacrifice that her parents and brother made to support her, the stakes crept higher, inuring them all to gymnastics' inherent physical and psychological trauma. After claiming the U.S. title, Sey was shell-shocked and exhausted, suddenly robbed of her lifelong motivation. I'd always been a fighter, a come-from-behind girl. Now that I was on top, the battle would be unwinnable. The memoir's poignant glimpses at Sey's adult struggle to reckon with her past are regrettably sparse, and her prose occasionally lapses into...\n\n2275.00 руб.*\n\nChina's Great Leap: The Beijing Games and Olympian Human Rights Challenges\n\nAn essential book for understanding China on the cusp of the Olympics, \"China's Great Leap\" draws on the expertise of many of the world's leading China experts. These writers examine the People's Republic of China today as its government and 1.3 billion people prepare for the 2008 Olympic Games. When Beijing first sought the Games, China was still recovering from the upheavals of Maoist rule and adapting to a market revolution. Today China wants to engage with the outside world-while fully controlling the engagement. How will the new leaders in Beijing manage the Olympic process and the internal and external pressures for reform it creates? \"China's Great Leap\" will illuminate China's recent history and outline how domestic and international pressures in the context of the Olympics could achieve human rights change. Learn about key areas for human rights reform and how the Olympics could represent a possible great leap forward for the people of China and for the world. With...\n\n2430.00 руб.*\n\nChristopher A. Shaw\n\nFive Ring Circus: Myths and Realities of the Olympic Games\n\nThe shiny rings of the Olympic Games have grown tarnished over the years as doping, corruption, and other scandals rise to the surface. Those scandals are the tip of the iceberg, according to author Christopher A.Shaw, the lead spokesperson for several anti-Games groups. \"Five Ring Circus\" details the history of how Vancouver won the bid for the 2010 Games, who was involved, and what the real motives were. It describes the role of corporate media in promoting the Games, the machinations of government and business, and the opposition that emerged. Disturbing questions come to light: Why does the International Olympic Committee pay no taxes? Who are the real estate developers behind the Vancouver bid? Why are mega projects paid for with tax dollars? What are the true costs of the Games? The Olympic Games, once considered the pinnacle of athleticism and fair play, have become a cesspool of greed, backroom deals, and...\n\n666.00 руб.*\n\nLeigh Olsen\n\nGoing for Gold: The 2008 U.S. Women's Gymnastics Team\n\nWith the hottest gymnasts in the country flipping their way into the spotlight, the U.S. has the team to beat in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
