        "text": "ALBANY – While Barry Tallackson successfully burst onto the professional scene for the Albany River Rats, Ari Ahonen continues to play the best hockey of his career.\n\nIn his professional debut, Tallackson tallied a goal and an assist in the first period to set the tone and Ahonen made 29 saves to notch his seventh consecutive victory for Albany, which rolled past Bridgeport, 5-3 on Wednesday at Pepsi Arena.\n\nAlthough long since eliminated from the playoff hunt, the River Rats (29-48), who have won 10 of 12, continue to emerge as one of the hottest teams in the American Hockey League.\n\n“It was great,” said Tallackson, who was selected as the game’s first star and will turn 22 today. “The first game to get two points is pretty sweet. I was at the right place at the right time and playing with good linemates.”\n\n“It definitely took a couple shifts,” said Tallackson, who joined the Rats after completing his senior season with the University of Minnesota, a career which included two Frozen Four titles and another championship appearance this year. “I was a little uptight, I was a little nervous, I’m playing in the big time now. A little nervous, but after a couple shifts I got used to it and played my game.”\n\nAhonen, in his fourth pro season, has registered a career-high four shutouts and has allowed eight goals during his seven-game winning streak.\n\n“It’s a team sport, though,” Ahonen said. “Wins come with good team defense, so it’s not just me making the saves. We had a really nice run last week and we still have three games to go, so hopefully we can get it going again.”\n\n“Ari played well all year and so has Clemmer (Scott Clemmensen),” Albany coach Robbie Ftorek said. “We just weren’t able to get enough goals for them early on and now we’re playing much sounder in the defensive zone.”\n\nBridgeport (35-43) got within 2-1 on Barrett Heisten’s goal at 16:15, but the Rats struck again as Tuomas Pihlman finished off a 2-on-1 break with Adrian Foster and scored on a wrister at 6:11 of the second.\n\nThe Sound Tigers again drew within one on Rob Collins’ goal at 8:56, but Albany’s Brian Gionta tipped in an Ivan Khomutov drive at 11:45.\n\nAleksander Suglobov scored his team-leading 25th goal on a blast from the right faceoff circle for a 5-2 Rats advantage."
