The first 30 personalities selected for the Hall of Fame were inducted and honoured during the 1997 World Championship in Helsinki. Since then, IIHF Hall of Fame classes have been inducted with honorees coming from around the globe in three categories: Player, Builder, Referee and the Richard \"Bibi\" Torriani Award for outstanding careers by players from non-top hockey nations. The Paul Loicq Award is given for outstanding contributions to international hockey.\n\nThe permanent headquarters of the IIHF Hall of Fame is located in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, where artifacts and memorabilia from around the world is displayed. Every year the legends are inducted on the medal day of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship."
