        "text": "Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, Nashville Predators forward James Neal and Anaheim Ducks defenseman Sami Vatanen were among the high-profile players made available on Sunday for the Vegas Golden Knights to select in the N.H.L. expansion draft.\n\nNow it is up to Golden Knights General Manager George McPhee to pore over the list of unprotected players and select one from each of the N.H.L.’s 30 teams by Wednesday.\n\nFleury, a member of three Stanley Cup champion teams, was left unprotected by Pittsburgh after he agreed to waive the no-movement clause in his contract. The Penguins instead protected Matt Murray a week after he led them to win their second consecutive championship.\n\nThe Predators were put in a bind by exposing Neal, a 10-time 20-goal-scorer, because they elected to protect a fourth defenseman.\n\nVatanen was the odd-man out in being left unprotected from a deep and talented group of Ducks defensemen. But he will not be ready for the start of the season after having surgery to repair a shoulder injury.\n\nNeal was not the only high-profile player left exposed by the Predators, who are coming off their first Stanley Cup finals appearance. Other notable Nashville players unprotected were the young forwards Pontus Aberg and Colton Sissons, who combined to score eight goals in the playoffs.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
