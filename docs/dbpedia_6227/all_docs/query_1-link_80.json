        "text": "Asymmetric warfare is arguably the main threat facing the United States since the end of the Cold War. Gone are the years when America knew who its enemy was, and more importantly, knew where it was. With the Obama administration now in the White House, this is a crucial juncture in American foreign policy making. The following pages examine the body of scholarship on asymmetric warfare as it has been impacted by the three primary components of American foreign policy: unilateralism, preemption, and military hegemony. This article asks two central questions. First it inquires as to whether these three key components of America’s foreign policy, popularly known as the Bush Doctrine, have been more extreme under the administration of President George W. Bush than they have under previous administrations. The second question is whether the Bush Doctrine has increased asymmetric warfare in the form of terrorism—or whether it has been an effective policy against it. The article begins by examining the Bush administration’s foreign policy as outlined in both the 2002 and the 2006 National Security Strategy (NSS), investigating the history of each of the three primary components of the Bush Doctrine in America: unilateralism, preemption, and military hegemony—and reviewing the opinions of a number of scholars, security professionals, and journalists as to whether the impact of these initiatives reduced global asymmetric warfare in the form of terrorism or whether it incited more terrorist activity.\n\nSince 9/11, the United States has achieved notable gains against al Qaeda, and also Daesh, all while avoiding another mass-casualty attack at home. Yet, institutionally, culturally, and in its capabilities, the United States government remains seriously ill-equipped for the task of countering irregular threats. Partly as a result, Islamist extremism shows no sign of being defeated, having instead metastasized since 9/11 and spread. Why, given the importance accorded to counterterrorism, has the US approach remained inadequate? What is impeding more fundamental reforms? The article evaluates the United States' way of irregular warfare: its troubled engagement with counterinsurgency and its problematic search for lower-cost and lower-risk ways of combating terrorism. It suggests needed reforms but acknowledges also the unlikelihood of change. Keywords: Since 9/11, the United States has developed the military capability of targeting and eliminating individual terrorist leaders and operatives. It has maintained a powerful conventional combat capability, which helped it overthrow the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Daesh in Iraq. It has amassed substantial operational experience in counterinsurgency in several theatres, and at times achieved impressive results at the tactical and operational levels. It has also developed and fielded materiel and structures relevant to counterinsurgency and stability operations. And yet, despite these advances, nearly two decades since the mass-casualty terrorist\n\nThe U.S. has spent the last two decades, during its short time as the singular superpower, engaging relatively successfully in counterterrorism. However, we have now entered a new era of Great Power Competition (GPC) with adversaries; Russia and China. In the last decade, these nations have either caught up to the U.S. or have gained a slight edge in several types of warfare, while they challenge the international order created and dominated by the U.S. In particular, Russian threats loom over our NATO Baltic allies, while Chinese threats loom over the South China Sea and Taiwan. The U.S. has inadequate conventional deterrence forces ing each of these theaters and likely could not respond to crisis in each area simultaneously. Concurrently, though not allied, Russia and China have increased cooperation. It will take many years for the U.S. to build adequate conventional forces to prevent each of these adversaries from asserting their will and taking and holding the sovereign territory of our allies or partners. Yet history reveals a type pf warfare for which we and our allies and partners can prepare for immediately at little cost to add a layer of deterrence to assist in denying ultimate victory to our adversaries with scarce dedication of resources. It is a type of warfare that can asymmetrically impose costs on an occupier by forcing him to devote substantial resources to his own security while also making his political consolidation of the occupied territory very difficult if not impossible. Its methods range from violence led by an authorized organization fighting to reclaim sovereignty, to passive and peaceful activities by the general population. This method of warfare, which must be organized, trained and equipped immediately, is resistance."
