        "text": "The club was founded in 1946 as CDKA (Centralnyy Dom Krasnoy Armii - Central House of the Red Army, referring to the Army community centre in Moscow). It was known as CDSA (with Red Army changed to Soviet Army) in 1952 - 1954, as CSK MO (Central Sports Club of the Moscow Military District) in 1955 - 1959, and acquired its current name in 1960.\n\nCSKA was almost as dominant in the European Cup. They won all but two titles from 1969 to 1990, including 13 in a row from 1978 to 1990. The team first coach was Anatoli Tarasov, who would later become famous as the coach of the Soviet national team. Tarasov coached the Red Army Team, either alone or with co-coaches, for most of the time from 1946 to 1975. The team's greatest run came under Viktor Tikhonov, who was coach from 1977 to 1996--serving for most of that time as coach of the national team.\n\nThe Red Army Team was able to pull off such a long run of dominance because during the Soviet era, the entire CSKA organization was a functioning division of the Red Army. Taking full advantage of the fact that all able-bodied Soviet males had to serve in the military, it was literally able to draft the best young hockey players in the Soviet Union onto the team. There was a substantial overlap between the rosters of the Red Army Team and the Soviet national team, which was one factor behind the Soviets\\\\\\' near-absolute dominance of international hockey from the 1950s through the early 1990s. By the late 1980s, however, the long run of Red Army dominance caused a significant dropoff in attendance throughout the league. Not surprisingly, discipline was quite strict, especially under Tikhonov. His players practiced for as many as 11 months a year, and were confined to training camp most of that time even if they were married. However, he mellowed somewhat after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nCSKA has remained one of the strongest clubs in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, though it has yet to win a championship. Off the ice, the massive exodus of Russian players to the NHL hit CSKA particularly hard, in part because, as mentioned above, nearly all of the country\\\\\\'s best players were on the roster. For a time in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was briefly unofficially known as \\\\\\\"the Russian Penguins\\\\\\\" after the Pittsburgh Penguins bought an interest in the team.[1]\n\nOne of the most feared lines in hockey history was the KLM Line of the 1980s. The name came from the last names of the three players, Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov, and Sergei Makarov. Together with defensemen Viacheslav Fetisov and Alexei Kasatonov, they were known as the Green Unit because they wore green jerseys in practice. The five-man unit formed a dominant force in European hockey throughout the decade. All five players were later permitted to go to the NHL in 1989, with mixed results. Krutov had the shortest NHL career, lasting only one season in Vancouver; Makarov (who won the Calder Trophy in 1990) and Kasatonov were out of the NHL by 1997; Fetisov and Larionov won the Stanley Cup twice together with Detroit before Fetisov retired in 1998; Larionov would win a third Cup with Detroit in 2002, before retiring from New Jersey in 2004.\n\nAt the IIHF Centennial All-Star Team, out of 6 players selected 4 players once played at CSKA Moscow.\n\nNotable players:\n\nBoris Alexandrov\n\nHelmuts Balderis\n\nVsevolod Bobrov\n\nPavel Bure\n\nValeri Bure\n\nNikolai Drozdetsky\n\nSergei Fedorov\n\nVyacheslav Fetisov\n\nAnatoli Firsov\n\nAlexander Frolov\n\nAlexei Gusarov\n\nValeri Kamensky\n\nAlexei Kasatonov\n\nNikolai Khabibulin\n\nValeri Kharlamov\n\nAndrei Khomutov\n\nVladimir Konstantinov\n\nKonstantin Korneyev\n\nAndrei Kovalenko\n\nVyacheslav Kozlov\n\nIgor Kravchuk\n\nVladimir Krutov\n\nViktor Kuzkin\n\nIgor Larionov\n\nSergei Makarov\n\nVladimir Malakhov\n\nBoris Mikhailov\n\nBoris Mironov\n\nDmitri Mironov\n\nGrigory Mkrtychan\n\nAlexander Mogilny\n\nMikhail Orekhov\n\nVladimir Petrov\n\nNikolai Pronin\n\nAlexander Ragulin\n\nAnatoly Tarasov\n\nVladislav Tretiak\n\nGennady Tsygankov\n\nNikolai Zherdev\n\nViktor Zhluktov\n\nSergei Zubov\n\nIce sports complex CSKA named after Bobrov hosted the last hockey match\n\nThe ice sports complex CSKA named after Vsevolod Bobrov hosted the last professional hockey match\n\nIt was the game of the quarter-finals of the Kharlamov Cup between the Red Army and Dynamo Moscow.

The new hockey stadium will accommodate at least 10,000 spectators.
