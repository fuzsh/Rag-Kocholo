        "text": "Lighting the Lamp With Rick Ackerman\n\nIt was one hell of a deal that brought about the establishment of the New Jersey Devils hockey club. Of course, the actual birth of the franchise began here in Missouri when the NHL granted an expansion franchise to Kansas City. The Scouts began play in 1974. The club was so terrible in so many ways that after only two years, the franchise was relocated to Denver as the Colorado Rockies. Eventually the franchise was purchased by New Jersey shipping tycoon John McMullen, who finally won approval from the NHL in 1982 to move the team to the Garden State as the Devils.\n\nThe Devils did not qualify for the playoffs for six of the first seven seasons in East Rutherford, New Jersey, at the Brendan Byrne Arena (renamed the Continental Airlines Arena and later the Izod Center), seating 19,040 for hockey. In 2007 the Devils moved to the Prudential Center (The Rock) in Newark, seating 16,514 for hockey. I guess the owners figured the team would do poorly and attendance would suffer since the Rock seats some 2,500 fewer fans.\n\nThe Devils qualified for the playoffs for the next five seasons and went to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1994, losing to the Stanley Cup champion Rangers. The following year, New Jersey won the Cup, sweeping Detroit in four games. The Devils would repeat five years later in 2000, defeating the Dallas Stars, led by Conn SmytheTrophy winner Scott Stevens. Three years later New Jersey captured its third NHL championship, defeating Anaheim in seven games in 2003. The Devils would return to the Finals in 2012, but lost to Los Angeles, the last time they participated in postseason play.\n\nThe Blues and Devils have never met in the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nThe two franchises have made a number of trades over the years, though. The Blues consummated two trades with Kansas City, obtaining Chris Evans and a fourth-round draft choice for Larry Giroux in October 1974. The draft pick turned out to be goaltender Mike Liut, selected 76th overall in 1976. Another deal saw the Blues acquire forward Lynn Powis and a second-round pick from the Scouts for forwards Denis Dupere and Craig Patrick in June 1975. The second-rounder turned out to be Brian Sutter, taken 20th overall in 1976.\n\nThe Blues also made two trades with the Colorado Rockies, obtaining defenseman Bill Baker, 1980 Olympic Miracle hero, for Dick Lamby and Joe Micheletti in December 1981. Baker played 35 games (three goals, eight points) wearing the Note before moving on to the Rangers. Micheletti is better known as a television and radio broadcaster, starting with the Minnesota North Stars in 1991 before working with Dan Kelly on KMOX radio and with Ken Wilson on local television in St. Louis. Micheletti would move to New York after that to work with both the Islanders and Rangers, as well as cover the Olympics for NBC and CBS.\n\nA more important deal with the Rockies saw the Blues acquire defenseman Rob Ramage in June 1982 for two first-round draft choices, Rocky Trottier in 1982 and John MacLean in 1983. Ramage played six seasons in St. Louis, scoring 67 goals and 296 points in 441 games. In 1988 he was part of the trade with Calgary that saw Brett Hull come to St. Louis.\n\nThe Blues made two trades with the New Jersey in 1985, picking up popular checking-center Rick Meagher for winger Perry Anderson in August and obtaining Shawn Evans and a draft choice for center Mark Johnson in September.\n\nTen years later the Blues made a third trade with the Devils, dealing with long-time GM Lou Lamoriello. Esa Tikkanen, previously acquired from the Rangers with defenseman Doug Lidster for center Petr Nedved, was dispatched to New Jersey for a third-round draft choice, the forgettable Ville Nieminen, who played 14 pointless games before going to Sweden to play for the Malmo Redhawks. Defenseman Ricard Persson and winger Mike Peluso joined the Blues in November 1996 in exchange for Ken Sutton and a second-round draft choice. Persson lasted four seasons in St. Louis and Worcester and is best remembered for recording the primary assist on Pierre Turgeon’s series-winning goal in game seven against the Coyotes in 1999. Peluso played 44 games (two goals, five points) before moving on to Calgary. In February 1996, defenseman Chris McAlpine and a draft choice came to St. Louis for popular center Peter Zezel. McAlpine played 141 games over four seasons, while Zezel played only 23 games over two seasons in New Jersey, registering six assists before moving on to Vancouver for two seasons.\n\nA terribly troubled Mike Danton and a third-round draft choice (No. 101 overall, Konstantin Zakaharov) became St. Louis property in June 2003 in exchange for a third-rounder (No. 93, Ivan Khomutov). Neither Russian ever played in the NHL. Danton played one season for the Blues, notching seven goals and 12 points in 68 games before pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in July 2004 and being sent to prison. He was granted parole five years later in September 2009 and continued his hockey career at St. Mary’s College before resuming his professional career in Europe in 2011. The Blues would make three more trades with the Devils, obtaining a first-round draft choice (Patrik Berglund) for two draft picks in 2006, forward Cam Janssen for defenseman Bryce Salvador in 2008 and a fifth-round pick (Niko Mikkola) for Matt D’Agostini in 2015.\n\nHalf of the Blues 30 games have now been decided by one goal, and the Blues have won nine and lost only two in regulation, with four losses in bonus time. Not too shabby, eh?"
