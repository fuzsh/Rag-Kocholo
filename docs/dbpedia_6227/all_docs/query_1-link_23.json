        "text": "It’s commonplace that college hockey players are in and out of the line-up due to injury. But what happens when an assistant coach goes on the disabled list. Sure, the injured coach can sit behind a desk, use the phone and push pencils but what about the on-ice coaching. Well, apparently there is a provision in the NCAA that allows for a “provisional” on-ice coach. That’s where Grand Rapids, MN native Kurt Kleinendorst comes to the rescue. He’s been hired as a provisional coach mainly for on-ice instruction and coaching until coach Mike Gibbons is able to return to the ice. At this point, the length of time is unknown, but it could be up to six months as Gibbon’s recovers from a late summer water skiing mishap resulting in hamstring surgery.\n\nKleinendorst, a fellow “Iron Ranger”, is a product of the legendary Grand Rapids, MN high school programs of the 70’s. Following an exemplary high school career he skated for Providence College, then of the ECAC, racking up nearly 200 points during his four years of play. That led to a hockey career spanning a period of seven years with stints for the US Olympic Team, Tulsa of the CHL, Salt Lake City of the IHL, Utica in the AHL and a couple of seasons in Europe. He then leveraged that experience into his second hockey career as a coach that continues today. His experience in coaching is quite extensive from being a head coach in the East Coach Hockey League and American Hockey League, to an assistant coaching position in the NHL with the New Jersey Devils. He’s also coached the US National Under 18 team, one year at the University of Alabama- Huntsville and most recently spent two years in the Minnesota Wild organization as head coach of the Iowa Wild.\n\nThe bottom line is it’s a luxury for head coach Bob Motzko to have the availability of a coach that’s pretty much seen it all over his 25 year coaching career. And, certainly this will not be the last gig for Kleinendorst, still only 54 years old. Obviously, he’s enjoying this temporary position as he told the St. Cloud Times ” It’s only day one, but this group really seems to be grounded, seem to be genuine and they have tons of skill. I couldn’t tell you the last time I’ve stood out in practice with that amount of skill and that’s a compliment to Bob. It’s fun to coach a team that’s got that kind of potential”.\n\nNice comments from a coach who’s been around the block a few times.\n\nNotes: Former SCSU Head Coach, Craig Dahl is back in St. Cloud for some SCSU hockey alumni gatherings this weekend and to attend the Minnesota State University- Mankato series. He spent some time at SCSU men’s hockey practice yesterday and came away very impressed with the high-tempo practice sessions engineered by coach Motzko and with the young talent on this years SCSU squad. He was also invited to the locker room to give a talk to the team – all of whom were not even born when Coach Dahl started the Huskies Division I program in 1987. Coach Dahl is in the financial services industry in Rochester, NY and also is a volunteer coach for the Nazareth College Golden Flyers, members of the ECAC West D III conference.\n\nNotes: Minnesota Score Radio will be broadcasting the “SCSU Hockey Report” on AM 660 WBHR-ESPN, “the Bear”. I’m told it will air every other Friday between 3-4 PM and repeating on Sunday at 9 AM and is hosted by long-time sports hosts, Wally Langfellow and Eric Nelson. The program reach is from the Twin Cities to Bemidji. It can also be picked up via internet stream.\n\n-Bill Prout-\n\n."
