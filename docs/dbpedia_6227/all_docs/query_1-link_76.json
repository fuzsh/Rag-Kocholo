        "text": "The Sovereign Sovjets and so on...\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTämä sivu on saatavilla myös suomeksi. This page is also available in Finnish.\n\nThe 1970’s\n\nThis decade meant, that the Sovjet Union took over the Olympic and World Championship hockey. The North-Americans only showed their sportmanship in these games now and then. Team Finland was trying to find its style of play and a long-run development. The mental side might have needed some developing too... But even the Swedes had little means to block the eastern block. By the end of this decade the World Championship North-European teams had to think about the NHL and also the flopped WHA...\n\n1970 Stockholm\n\nThe Maple Leaf country was supposed to start the World Championships of this decade. The locations planned for the tournament were Winnipeg and Montreal. But then... Avery Brundage from the IOC threatened again to block ice hockey from the Olympic tournament for using the pros. The International Ice Hockey Federation had already given a permit for using nine professional players in the tournament. Some people might find the thinking of Avery Brundage interesting: the twenty-year-old lieutenant-colonels, doing nothig else but practising hockey ever day, were true amateurs... So, the permission for using pros was postponed. For pretty obvious reasons Canada gave up the IIHF and Olympic tournaments for eight years.\n\nAnd then: for the second time in a row, a stand-in city was the host, by co-incidence again Stockholm! Inspired again by a home-crowd the Swedish team naturally took the silver-medal. But Team Finland made history in Stockholm too, winning Sweden for the first time on the IIHF tournament level, by 3-1. The Swedish coach, Arne Strömberg, has been told to have called the Finnish team being a collection of strange individuals: Matti Keinonen as a whirlpool, Jorma Vehmanen hunting the puck at the blue line. And Veli-Pekka Ketola being the “tower of Pisa”. The Sovjet coach Tarasov’s comment about them was: “How come such a fine collection of individuals can be such a poor team?” Later, Veli-Pekka Ketola from this team Finland become the first Finnish to play pro in Canada...\n\nThe crown jewel came, when Finland beat Czechoslovakia too in the same tournament . Despite this triumph, Team Finland had to face a six-year streak of placing-fourths. The only exception being the fifth place in Sapporo 1972. One reason in this tournament for the fourth place was a lost to East-Germany by 3-4.\n\nUSSR: Viktor Konovalenko, Vladislav Tretjak; Vitali Davidov, Anatoli Firsov, Valeri Harlamov, Aleksander Jakusev, Vladimir Lutshenko, Aleksander Maltsev(15+6), Boris Mihailov, Jevgeni Misakov, Valeri Nikitin, Vladimir Petrov, Jevgeni Polagjev, Viktor Polupanov, Aleksander Ragulin, Igor Romisevski, Vladimir Sadrin, Vjatseslav Starsinov, Valeri Vasiljev, Vladimir Vikulov.

(10 5 0 5 31-40).\n\n1971 Berne, Geneva\n\nThe northern kingdom finally gave the tournament forward to the former kingdom of European hockey: Switzerland. After two years absence, there was a North-American team in pool A. The US Team won Czechoslovakia 5-1, Keith Christiansen shared the position as the most penalized player with a West-German called Alois Schloder (the total minutes being 18). Despite its traditions, the USA had to face pool B in the next tournament...\n\nThe Czechs and the Slovaks played a tied score with the Sovjet Union and won them once. Then came the Swedes.... winning by 6-5. So, in a way one can say, that An Eastern National Club Team had replaced the traditional Canadian National Club Teams. Just like the Canadians had done before: the Sovjets were presented by ZSKA Moscow players, with some additions from the other clubs. And just like in the good old Canadian times, this team USSR’s players took five first spots in the scoring statistics. The goalie of the team, Viktor Konovalenko, was highly regarded in this tournament. Earlier, it was thought many times, that his maverick style of play caused as much gray hair to his defencemen as to the forwards of the opposing teams.\n\nWith Finland… again the keyword being if. Probably it is only natural, that the “if” was Sweden. In a two-round series Finland was leading the first game 1-0. Then the things happened in Swedish style: the puck moved to the goal by a Finnish skate. In the second round game the scores were 1-1 too. Then Lauri Mononen faced a five-minute penalty... and the final score was 1-2 for Sweden. Curiously the Finnish team missed the first-ever medal by just one point. The defenceman Ilpo Koskela being the best scorer might tell something about the games of Finland.\n\nUSSR: Viktor Konovalenko, Vladislav Tretjak; Gennadi Tsigankov, Vitali Davidov, Anatoli Firsov(10+9), Valeri Harlamov, Viktor Kuskin, Juri Ljapkin, Vladimir Lutshenko, Aleksander Maltsev, Aleksander Martinjuk, Boris Mihailov, Jevgeni Misakov, Vladimir Petrov, Aleksander Ragulin, Igor Romisevski, Vladimir Sadrin, Vjatseslav Starsinov, Vladimir Vikulov, Jevgeni Simin.

(10 4 1 2 31-42).\n\nThe Olympics\n\n1972\n\nSapporo\n\nFor the first time the Winter Olympics took place in Asia. And for the first time the IIHF arranged its own tournament in the Olympic year. One could easily name these tournaments as the additional-tournaments. The Second World War –time emperor Hirohito had now become a regular representative monarch, wondering about the violent nature of hockey. His countryman, Teiji Honma, had presented a samurai-ninja –style mask in the international hockey already in 1936. But in this tournament a plastic, cage-like goalie’s mask made its break-through. Another break-through was made by the most North-American –style playing European goalie, his first name being Vladislav... The Sovjets had lost a December before by 1-4 against Finland in Moscow and it was time for the grand-old man Konovalenko to step aside. Also Anatoli Firsov had to step aside after this tournament. There has been talks about a possible effort by him to defect... There has been talks about that too, that this Sovjet team played in an exceptionally “Canadian” style.\n\nUSA won its qualification game against Switzerland by 5-3. But after that “God blessed America” in the most spectacular manner. The team reaching the silver-medal being basically the same team facing pool B in the previous year’s World Championship tournament. Finland won Norway in its own qualification game by 13-1, so the game series as a whole they had more goals for than against. In the final series the team was fifth with less goals for than against. Maybe getting to know the Japanese culture inspired the whole Finnish team to have its moment in this tournament: Finland won Sweden for the first time in the Olympic level by 4-3. A Swedish player’s comment being: “I don’t mind, they can sometimes even beat the Sovjets”. Because of this game, Sweden remained fourth.\n\nCanada was absent from this tournament and from the next Olympic tournament too. They were more interested about certain games against the Sovjets this year. Also during the next few years, the World Championships remained to the Red Machine... or to the eastern block anyway.\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Aleksander Pashkov; Vitali Davidov, Viktor Kuzkin, Aleksander Ragulin, Anatoli Firsov, Igor Romishevski, Jevgeni Mishakov, Jevgeni Zimin, Gennadi Tsigankov, Vladimir Lutshenko, Aleksander Jakushev, Vladimir Shadrin, Valeri Vasiljev, Aleksander Maltsev, Valeri Harlamov(9+6), Boris Mihailov, Vladimir Petrov, Vladimir Vikulov, Juri Blinov.

(6 4 0 2 23-18).\n\n3. Czechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Vlado Dzurilla; Josef Cerny, Jiri Holik, Josef Horesovsky, Vaclav Nedomansky(8+3), Jiri Kochta, Oldrich Machac, Frantisek Pospisil, Eduard Novak, Ivan Hlinka, Bhuslav Statsny, Vladimir Martinec, Vladimir Bednar, Rudolf Tajcnar, Karel Vohralik, Jaroslav Holik, Richard Farda. (6 4 0 2 34-15).\n\n5. Finland: Jorma Valtonen, Stig Wetzell; Juha Rantasila, Seppo Lindström, Heikki Järn, Heikki Riihiranta, Ilpo Koskela, Pekka Marjamäki; Lauri Mononen(7+0), Timo Turunen, Juhani Tamminen, Veli-Pekka Ketola, Lasse Oksanen, Esa Peltonen, Matti Keinonen, Harri Linnonmaa, Matti Murto, Jorma Peltonen, Jorma Vehmanen, Seppo Repo. (6 3 0 3 27-25).\n\nThe World Championships\n\n1972\n\nPrague\n\nIn the first tournament ever arranged in the Olympic year the Sovjet Union finally lost its streak of Champions’ titles. The socialistic realism had taken its tow, and the creator of the Grand Sovjet hockey had been replace by a coaching team of Vselodov Bobrov-Nikolai Putshkov. A statement by Firsov was: “Bobrov is a perfect nobody”. So, there might have been some frictions within the team for this change. Czechoslovakia made its domestic tournament a jubilee, after getting the Championship title for the first time for 23 years. Even the Holik brothers, known to be very different personalities, were their best friends now. Switzerland, unfortunately, returned to the pool A one year after they had arranged a pool A tournament. The most noticed person in this tournament was Gaston Furrer, bein the most penalized player in the tournament with 28 minutes. But they had one good game too, winning Finland 3-2...\n\nSo Finland remained fourth, again. By winning Sweden 5-4 they dropped their neighbour to the third place, which might have brought some kind of comfort. Lauri Mononen was acting like a super-hero. He was the first Finnish player ever to be in the top ten in scoring statistics, being even better than the best Swede. Another great moment for this Team Finland was also a victory by 13-3 over West-Germany. But maybe the fourth place somehow depended on the absence of the North-Americans these years...\n\nThis tournament was a bulls-eye by the IIHF. But in the future these Olympic year’s World Championships may have had some kind of in-between spirit... of course the economical reasons haven’t effected the IIHF in this matter!\n\nCzechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Vlado Dzurilla; Vladimir Bednar, Jiri Bubla, Josef Horesovsky, Milan Kuzela, Oldrich Machac, Frantisek Pospisil, Rudolf Tajcnar; Richard Farda, Julius Haas, Ivan Hlinka, Jaroslav Holik, Jiri Holik, Jan Klapac, Jiri Kochta, Vladimir Martinec, Vaclac Nedomansky(9+6), Josef Palecek, Bohuslav Statsny.

(10 5 1 4 49-33).\n\n4. Finland: Jorma Valtonen, Stig Wetzell; Juha Rantasila, Jouko Öystilä, Pekka Marjamäki, Timo Nummelin, Heikki Riihiranta, Pekka Rautakallio, Pertti Valkeapää; Lauri Mononen(9+6), Juhani Tamminen, Lasse Oksanen, Timo Turunen, Seppo Repo, Veli-Pekka Ketola, Esa Peltonen, Matti Murto, Seppo Ahokainen, Harri Linnonmaa, Matti Keinonen. (10 4 0 6 47-48).\n\n1973\n\nMoscow\n\nThe Luzhniki arena enlightened the fierce come-back of the Red Machine. Their best-ever score being 100-18 in a ten-game series. The “troika” formed by Harlamov-Mihailov-Petrov scoring 43 goals altogether. So, the times they had been a-changing from 1924, when Harry “Moose” Watson had scored 37 goals in 5 games alone. But Sweden was this time a team not easily giving up, losing only 3-4! But the Sovjets had Tretjak, presenting the most North-European saves style as a goalie again. Ragulin made history by being a World Champion for the tenth time! The Sovjet team got only six first spots in the scoring-statistics.\n\nAgain the North-American teams were absent. The Americans playing still on pool B level, despite their previous Olympic success. When The Team Canada was playing exhibition games for the games against the Sovjets, Ulf Sterner from Sweden played in an un-Swedish style, by hurting a Canadian player’s tongue. But in the NHL he hadn’t made it in the 1960’s, where WHA had by now become the first challenger for the NHL for years. This new rival might have saved the level of North-American hockey. WHA opened doors seriously for the European top players and paid proper salaries too. Competing with the NHL, they may have needed a certain amount of top players...\n\nFinland played its most maverick tournament ever, by being penalized for 129 minutes as a team. But the long-time defenceman Lalli Partinen played his best tournament here. The legendary Finnish whirpool, Matti Keinonen, finished his international career here, stretching his arms to the audience, while leaving the ice for being penalized. Despite this meant an extra-penalty for him, this also meant a No-More-Brazilian-soccer-like playing in Team Finland...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Aleksander Sidelnikov; Valeri Vasiljev, Aleksander Gusev, Jevgeni Polagjev, Juri Ljapkin, Gennadi Tsigankov, Vladimir Lutschenko, Aleksander Ragulin, Boris Mihailov, Vladimir Petrov(18+16), Valeri Harlamov, Aleksander Martinjuk, Vladimir Shadrin, Aleksander Jakushev, Juri Lebedev, Aleksander Maltsev, Aleksander Bodunov, Vjatseslav Anisin, Aleksander Volkov. (10 10 0 0 100-18).\n\n2. Sweden; Christer Abrahamsson, William Löfqvist; Tommy Abrahamsson, Mats Åhlberg, Roland Bond, Arne Carlsson, Inge Hammarström, Anders Hedberg, Björn Johansson, Stefan Karlsson, Tord Lundström, Ulf Nilsson, Börje Salming, Lars-Erik Sjöberg, Dan Söderström(7+6), Ulf Sterner, Karl-Johan Sundqvist, Håkan Wickberg, Kjell-Arne Wikström, Dick Yderström. (10 7 1 2 53-23).\n\n3. Czechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Jiri Chra; Peter Adamik, Jiri Bubla, Richard Farda, Ivan Hlinka, Jaroslav Holik, Jiri Holik(5+10), Josef Horesovsky, Jan Klapac, Jiri Kochta, Milan Kuzela, Oldrich Machac, Vladimir Martinec, Vaclav Nedomansky, Jiri Novak, Josef Palecek, Frantisek Pospisil, Bohuslav Statsny, Karel Vohralik. (6 1 3 48-20).\n\n4. Finland; Antti Leppänen, Jorma Valtonen; Pekka Kuusisto, Heikki Riihiranta, Seppo Lindström, Ilpo Koskela, Jouko Öystilä, Pekka Rautakallio, Lalli Partinen; Henry Leppä (3+5), Timo Sutinen, Esa Peltonen, Timo Turunen, Veli-Pekka Ketola, Juhani Tamminen, Matti Keinonen, Seppo Ahokainen, Lauri Mononen, Seppo Repo. (10 3 1 6 24-39).\n\n1974\n\nHelsinki\n\nThis tournament finally meant Helsinki to become a Finnish hockey-city. The arena called “Helsingin jäähalli” had been there for eight years and the facilities had been repaired to a proper condition. The city hosting a year later an important European cold-wartime conference had arranged a box for the honored guests too.\n\nThe Sovjet team was in a class of its own again. Though in the first round the European arch-rivals, Czechoslovakia, won them by 7-2. Later this year the two players of this Czech team, Vaclav Nedomansky and Richard Farda, moved to North-America in the own right. Though their government might not have said: “Right!”... Finland had its team of the decade. But its luck changed, when the goalie Antti Leppänen his hurt leg against Sweden, the game ending 3-3. After that game Finland won Czechoslovakia by 5-2, but after the game the goalie Stig Wetzell was caught for ephedrine in a doping-test. So, officially the Czechs won by 0-5. The sensational thing with this doping was, that the sample B was negative. Some have had their doubts about the leading doctor of the tournament, that was fired from his position as a Team Finland doctor before the games... though a Swede called Ulf Nilsson was caught for ephedrine too. Him playing regularly in North-America later. So, Finland had to use their third goalie, a stand-by goalie being Seppo Repo, a goalie in his junior-team times. The most memorable moment later was Finland’s Veli-Pekka Ketola’s diving into the goal, thus scoring the winning 5-4 goal against Czechoslovakia. If there hadn’t been doping, Sweden would have been second and Finland third. Czechoslovakia remaining fourth.\n\nAfter this team Finland started gradually to lose its touch by the end of the decade. One reason being probably the change of national hockey-professionalism. In the previous decade the old-timers of the national team used to play pro in countries like Austria. Now, the direction was North-America for the players in their prime...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Aleksander Sidelnikov; Aleksander Gusev, Valeri Vasiljev, Vladimir Lutshenko, Gennadi Tsigankov, Juri Ljapkin, Kusnetsov, Satalov, Boris Mihailov(9+6), Aleksander Petrov, Valeri Harlamov, Aleksander Maltsev, Vladimir Shadrin, Aleksander Jakushev, Sergei Kapustin, Vjatseslav Anissin, Aleksander Bodunov, Juri Lebedev, Vladimir Repnev. (10 9 0 1 64-18).\n\n2. Czechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Jiri Chra; Jan Suchy, Oldrich Machac, Frantisek Pospisil, Jiri Bubla, Milan Kuzela, Miroslav Dvorak, Vaclav Nedomansky, Jiri Holik, Richard Farda, Vladimir Martinec(10+5), Ivan Hlinka, Bohuslav Statsny, Jiri Kochta, Josef Palecek, Jan Klapac, Vladimir Veith, Bohuslav Eberman, Josef Augusta. (10 7 0 3 57-20).\n\n3. Sweden: Christer Abrahamsson, Curt Larsson; Tommy Abrahamsson, Gunnar Andersson, Arne Carlsson, Björn Johansson, Kjell-Rune Milton, Lars-Erik Sjöberg, Karl-Johan Sundqvist, Mats Åhlberg, Per Olof Brasar, Anders Hedberg, Stig-Göran Johansson, Stefan Karlsson, Tord Lundström, Willy Lindström(7+5), Dan Labraaten, Ulf Nilsson, Lars-Göran Nilsson, Håkan Pettersson, Dan Söderström, Håkan Wickberg. (10 5 1 4 38-24).\n\n4. Finland: Antti Leppänen, Stig Wetzell, Jorma Valtonen; Seppo Lindström, Pekka Marjamäki, Juha Rantasila, Heikki Riihiranta, Timo Saari, Seppo Suoraniemi, Jouko Öystilä; Veli-Pekka Ketola(7+3), Seppo Ahokainen, Juhani Tamminen, Esa Peltonen, Timo Sutinen, Henry Leppä, Jorma Peltonen, Lasse Oksanen, Harri Linnonmaa, Seppo Repo, Matti Murto. (10 4 2 2 34-39).\n\n1975\n\nMunich, Düsseldorf\n\nThis tournament took place in the most dualistic manner: the first week being played in an arena with a very high temperature in Munich. Then the second one in a very cold arena in Düsseldorf. The rink was surrounded only by nets, so Willy Lindström from Sweden was once hanging from them like a fish.\n\nNorth-America returned after a while to the pool A level, though still only by the USA. Some of the Finnish public were wondering, if the talks about ephedrine in bubble-gum were true, thinking about the American consumption... The most memorable North-American performance was the one by Mike Polich, being the most penalized player with 34 minutes. But still the American audience, coming from West-German military bases, strongly supported their team. Though that didn’t help this time, the first country playing hockey outside Canada remained the last in the final standings. Poland beame fifth with a routine performance.\n\nThe only surprise in this tournament was the routine: The Sovjet Union was a definite number one, Czechoslovakia a definite number two, Sweden a definite number three. In addition, Finland followed its routines by being fourth. As usual, Finland had won Sweden 2-1 in the first round, losing by 1-2 in the second round. Against Czechoslovakia Finland won shots on the cage, but the other team won the game by result. One thing causing friction in this team was obviously the previous-year coach Kalevi Numminen, favouring a Russian-like hockey, being replaced by Seppo Liitsola. He was favouring an old-fashioned, more Canadian-like style of play... Pekka Marjamäki became an All-Stars player from this Finnish team, the best scorer too. And the most penalized player of the team. The Finnish goalie, Antti Leppänen, caused som trouble in this tournament too, but now it was only his skates, not injury. Very probably the Finnish coaching team felt relieved after the opening game against USA...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Viktor Krivolapov; Valeri Vasiljev, Vladimir Lutshenko, Gennadi Tsigankov, Juri Ljapkin, Juri Fedorov, Aleksander Filipov, Juri Tjurin, Boris Mihailov, Vladimir Petrov, Valeri Harlamov, Aleksander Jakushev, Vladimir Shadrin, Vladimir Vikulov, Viktor Shalimov(11+8), Aleksander Maltsev, Vjatseslav Anissin, Juri Lebedev, Sergei Kapustin.

(10 5 0 5 36-34).\n\nThe Olympics\n\nInnsbruck\n\nThese games got into a stand-in city! The Americans making clear in a referendum, that they did like the Winter Olympics for Denver 1976. But with no taxes. Getting something for free and not giving anything in return might sound a bit non-American... So the Austrians had their second domestic games after twelve years. After this tournament, it took them twenty years to compete on the pool A in a domestic tournament. Their neighbouring country, West-Germany, was playing this time on the pool A tournament, a year after their domestic tournament.\n\nSweden faced the same thing in this tournament as Canada six years before. Officially a reason for their absence was the flow of their players to the North-American pro-leagues. Canada sent this time some officials to follow the tournament... So, for the first time team Finland was seriously considered as a favourite for medals. Pospisil faced a doping test, which was positive. But Poland didn’t become positive for this, getting a victory, but no points.\n\nThe Sovjet Union took the gold medal, though this tournament had been the main aim of Czechoslovakia too. Novy scored 0-1 and Hlinka 0-2. Then the Sovjets took care of the rest, though Novak still scored the third Czech goal. The final result being 4-3 for the Sovjets. The Sovjet coach was thinking, that team Finland became a bit too arrogant after their game against Czechoslovakia. They lost the game by 1-2, but played a great game. Like in the previous year, the Finnish goals were more for than against this time too. Without the help of a qualifying game. Besides this, an exhibition game against the Sovjet Union before the Olympics had been won! This time the word was “if” again... the Austrian mathematics helped the West-German team to the bronze-medals with more goals against than for. In the game Finland-USA the Sovjet referee Dombrowski showed the real face of Finlandisation by not approving a goal, that would have meant a tied game. USA was leading 4-5. In a slow replay it seemed a goal to be approved, the tied goal would have meant a Finnish bronze... Now Finland, USA and Western-Germany had the same points in the final standings. By coincidence this time the crucial thing considered was the games between the teams instead of goals-for-and-against. Later, the Finns learned more about a former Czech-German, Erich Kühnhackl, of this team...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Aleksander Sidelnikov; Vladimir Lutschenko, Gennadi Tsigankov, Aleksander Jakushev, Vladimir Shadrin(6+4), Valeri Vasiljev, Aleksander Maltsev, Vladimir Petrov, Valeri Harlamov, Boris Mihailov, Viktor Zluktov, Aleksander Gusev, Sergei Babinov, Juri Ljapkin, Sergei Kapustin, Viktor Shalimov, Boris Aleksandrov.

Now there were even talks about this tournament being their main aim of their season... Meanwhile in Team Finland there was a revolt against the head coach Seppo Liitsola, lead by Pekka Marjamäki. So, for example, an old-timer goalie Jorma Valtonen entered this team from Val Gardena, Italy. Later in the fall, while preparing for the first Canada Cup ever, Antti Heikkilä was named as the new head coach for Finland. At very first, he was considering having Seppo Liitsola as a trainer. In the spring of Poland, Team Finland was assembled from the promising players of the future, though this time they hardly reached the fifth position in the final standings. This time the skillfull playing Swedes had Stig Salming as a star, having penalties for 37 minutes.\n\nThe very first star of the tournament was the hosting Team Poland, though. Having lost to the Sovjet Union by tens of goals for years, now they had a sensational victory by 6-4. But this didn’t stop Poland to end up to the last spot in the final standings and end their position as a pool A team. For some reason they didn’t quite fulfil their promise as a top country in the 1930’s. In the 1970’s the reason was Erich Kühnhackl, a German star in the “pool A” game of this tournament. Later he also caused shivers to the spine of Finnish players sometimes, by just being on the ice.\n\nIn general this tournament was overshadowed by the tournament of the fall. For this tournament, to be called The Canada Cup later, Canada and USA assembled their best professionals to play against the Sovjets, Czechoslovakia and Finland. Naturally only Finland and Sweden had official professional players in their teams, on this stage mostly from the WHA. The most penalized player of Katowice 1976, Stig Salming came from an NHL club, Toronto Maple Leafs. Today the tournament has a humble name called The World Cup.\n\nCzechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Vlado Dzurilla; Oldrich Machac, Frantisek Pospisil, Jiri Bubla, Milan Kajkl, Milan Chalupa, Miroslav Dvorak, Frantisek Kaberle, Vladimir Martinec(9+11), Jiri Novak, Bohuslav Stastny, Marian Stastny, Ivan Hlinka, Jiri Holik, Eduard Novak, Milan Novy, Jaroslav Pouzar, Frantisek Cernik, Peter Stastny.

(10 2 4 4 35-41).\n\n1977\n\nVienna\n\nIn the arena called ”Wiener Stadthalle” the IIHF tournament was presented by Team Canada for the first time for eight years. Finally the national team was not assembled by the amateurs and not even by the minor league professionals. From now on the birthplace of modern ice hockey sent players from the teams, that didn’t make it to the Stanley Cup rounds. Many of these Canadian teams had difficulties in motivation. Also this team was named as a “Team Zoo” by the Canadian press. Wilf Paiement can be considered as a symbol of the Canadian national teams of this time in a way. He was on top both in scoring stats and penalties. But one can say, that so did a Sovjet players called Valeri Harlamov too. By the appearances of Paiement the European hockey audience learnt to know a concept “police”. Phil Esposito is best remembered for his throwing of the helmet, thinking “not a thing for a professional”.\n\nCzechoslovakia won an IIHF title for the first time for two times in a row. Czechoslovakia got this title in a more Swedish style than the Swedish themselves. The team called “Tre Kronor” won Sovjet Union twice and this meant that the Czechs got the first place in the final round, after being the third in the first one. In addition to all this, their equalizing goal 3-3 against Canada happened to be an offside. The Swedish Team’s victories over Sovjet Union also meant a bronze medal for the Red Machine. Since this was their lowest performance for 16 years, they might have been disappointed.\n\nFinland played a routine tournament, fifth in the final standings with more goals for than against. But the routine meant one of the greatest Finnish victories ever, against Rumania by 14-1. Losing only to the USA, while playing for places 5-8 in the final standings. The new head coach Lasse Heikkilä may have been a bit too much a routine professional. After this tournament his main achievement was to coach a club called Porin Ässät to the Championship of the Finnish League. The same spring there was some turbulence within the Finnish national team...\n\nCzechoslovakia: Jiri Holecek, Vlado Dzurilla; Oldrich Machac, Frantisek Pospisil, Jiri Bubla, Milan Kajkl, Frantisek Kaberle, Miroslav Dvorak, Milan Chalupa, Vladimir Martinec, Milan Novy(7+9), Bohuslav Ebermann, Jiri Novak, Ivan Hlinka, Jiri Holik, Marian Stastny, Jaroslav Pouzar, Eduard Novak, Vincent Lukac.

(10 5 0 5 45-43).\n\n1978\n\nPrague\n\nThis was a jubilee tournament of Czech hockey, that had begun 70 years earlier. But the Sovjet Union had a jubilee with winning the Championship title, despite having real beginning of play 38 year after the hosts. Though this time they were lucky too; they scored exactly those two goals to win Czechoslovakia they needed with goals-for-and-against. The Canadians, having started the modern form of ice hockey about fifty years before the Czechs, took the bronze this time.\n\nIn their opening game, the Canadians were leading Finland by 4-1. But finally Finland reached a victory by 6-4, having their second win over the Maple Leaf in an IIHF tournament. Against the Czechoslovakian team Finland played in their 1970’s manner; first leading by 4-1, losing finally by 4-6. After this they played still one very good game against the Sovjets. Then a West-German called Erich Kühnhackl came along and the Finnish team lost a bit their touch. That bit, that in the final series for places 5-8 their most important victory was against East-Germany in the final round by 7-2. This secured their position on the pool A the next year. The reason for such a poor performance with the best possible team might have been the new head coach, Kalevi Numminen. At this time one Helsinki –team played an old-fashioned rough-ride North-American hockey, and so did a team from the Finnish west-coast city, Pori. The traditional skillful playing of the Finnish hockey-founding city, Tampere, being very far from this style. And the same thing with Jokerit, Helsinki. Turku, together with Rauma, both on the Finnish west-coast, were having a style between these two. Maybe the Finnish hockey culture still needed some form of unification...\n\nA thing worth mentioning, Erich Kühnhackl was the first player to win the scoring statistics outside a medal-winning team after the Second World War, scores being 8+8. Though he was born in Czechoslovakia... The same year football (or soccer) was having its own World Championship tournament in Argentina. One comment being: “People say, no-one knows, what happens in the country during the tournament. But do we know, what happens in Czechoslovakia during the hockey World Championship tournament?”\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Aleksander Pashkov; Vladimir Lutshenko, Vjatseslav Fetisov, Vasili Pervuhin, Gennadi Tsigankov, Zinetula Biljaeletdinov, Juri Fedorov, Boris Mihailov, Vladimir Petrov, Valeri Harlamov, Aleksander Maltsev(5+8), Vladimir Golikov, Aleksander Golikov, Helmut Balderis, Viktor Zhlukotv, Sergei Kapustin, Juri Lebedev, Sergei Makarov.

Their thanks for this was winning the title with style. The local audience paid a lot of interest to the three players of the Canadian team with Russian roots. Though the other North-American team got more interest from the press, spending a lot of time in the night-club. There is also an urban legend, that one of the players came to the game from a company of a woman. This team showed its future abilities, though, by having a tied score against Czechoslovakia by 2-2. In the qualification round West-Germany showed also its skills against the Sovjets, losing only by 2-3. Team Poland also gave a hard time for Sweden, losing only by 5-6. In the medal series, there was excitement... for example, the Sovjets winning Czechoslovakia by 11-1 and 6-1. This tournament was a farewell to the legendary troika by Mihailov-Harlamov-Petrov in a World Championship tournament.\n\nFinland had paid its dues. Winning the series for places 5-8 with a strong, though routine-like performance. The only difficulties being against the American team, having a tie by 1-1 in the qualification round and losing by 2-6 in this series. The American team was given no chance whatsoever for the forth-coming Olympic tournament. This tournament meant the end of the national team career for the Finnish star of this decade, Pekka Marjamäki. Starting his career in the Swedish League in the beginning of the next decade. So, Finnish hockey had gone forward, despite all the ups and downs.\n\nThe Sovjets showed some showmanship, having the players of the teams interviewed, while coming to the arena by bus. The showmanship being practiced a long time before the World Championships being held in the Sovjet Union, them arranging an Izvestija –tournament before Christmas since the end of the 1960’s. Sometimes the tournaments had been visited by the North-American teams, but mostly there were only European teams.\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Vladimir Myshkin; Gennadi Zigankov, Vladimir Lutshenko, Valeri Vasiljev, Sergei Babinov, Zinetula Biljaletdinov, Vasili Pervuhin, Jurek Gimajev, Sergei Starikov, Boris Mihailov, Vladimir Petrov(7+8), Valeri Harlamov, Helmut Balderis, Viktor Zhluktov, Sergei Kapustin, Sergei Makarov, Vladimir Golikov, Aleksander Golikov, Aleksander Skvortsov, Juri Lebedev, Aleksander Jakusev.

The Red Machine was still going strong, but the end of the Cold War had its consequences by the end of the decade. A golden medal right in the beginning of the decade meant a new wave of interest in North-America to the international tournaments of one of the most North-American team sports. Sweden also got its first gold-medal for decades, still in a Swedish style...\n\nThe Olympics\n\n1980\n\nLake Placid\n\nThe United States showed its good taste as a host. The Olympic Village being placed into a future juvenile-penitentiary. They also showed the American modesty by building an arena for 8,000 spectators... The whole population of Lake Placid being 3,000 inhabitants. In addition to all this, mr. James Earl Carter run a boycott for the Summer Olympics. So his countrymen lost their medals there. Naturally, the president didn’t think about his re-election...\n\nThe hosts started their tournament with a 2-2 tied game against Sweden. Some were wondering their good luck... Then the Team USA won Czechoslovakia and finally the Sovjet Union in the final series. This meant the Olympic gold. This being the first international gold for North-America for 19 years.By making history the history repeated itself; the Americans won with an unknown team of students, a bit like in Squaw Valley. The coach being by coincidence the first reserve-player to be sent home from the 1960 gold-medal team: Herb Brooks. Besides this, Dave Christian’s father had been in the 1960 team. Eric Strobel started to promote the brother of ice hockey, bandy, in the United States after this tournament. Behind the Americans and the Sovjets Sweden took the bronze with a routine performance. This place being their fate in all the Olympic tournaments in this decade.\n\nFinland faced a sensation in the first game: the team being beaten by Poland by 4-5. Then Finland won Japan somehow by 6-3. But then the team won Canada by 4-3, the team that had returned to the Olympic circles, this time with an amateur-team. Finally, Finland was the fourth, for the first time with no “if”s. Though, Finland only lasted for the first two periods in their games. Leading them all after the first two ones and then stumbling the third one. Luckily, though, not losing all the games. Maybe the team still needed that final bit, both mentally and fysically...\n\nUSA: James Craig, Steve Janaszak: William ”Buzz” Schneider, John Harrington, Philip Verchota, John O’Callahan, William Baker, Kenneth Morrow, Michael Ramsey, Robert Suter, David Christian, David Silk, Mark Johnson(5+6), Robert McClanahan, Mark Pavelich, Steven Christoff, Neal Broten, Mike Eruzione, Eric Strobel, Mark Wells.

(7 3 1 3 31-25).\n\nThe World Championships\n\n1981\n\nStockholm\n\nIn this tournament the Red Machine was striking back! After the lost of the Olympic gold Viktor Tihonov drastically renewed the national team and started an over-human training programme. The one lasted for years, the players meeting their friends and relatives for thirty (=30) days a year. Maybe Tihonov loved his team more than his family... Even the absence of Valeri Harlamov didn’t matter now. He had gone the other rinks the previous year by a car-accident.\n\nThe final series was a bit less exciting than the previous year, Sweden losing to the Sovjets by 1-13. Besides the Tre Kronor, also Czechoslovakia had more goals against than for in the final standings. In their final game the Canadians played a tie 4-4 against the overwhelming Sovjets. Whenever one Canadian player, disliked by the audience for his rough style, appeared to the ice, the classy Swedish spectators were booing all the time. The best Swedish scorers Håkansson and Sundström had both soccer-like points (4+0). Though a Czechoslovakian called Eduard Novak had been an even more pure goal-scorer nine years earlier (9+0). The best scorer being for a change someone outside the grand six in this tournament. Not being the one causing grey hair to Team Finland, but Holger Meitinger from the same team (8+12).\n\nThe games of Team Finland practically ended after the first game in the qualification phase. They lost to Canada by 3-4 and this meant a place outside the medal series. The not-so-motivated team played later a tie against West-Germany by 4-4, then later 3-3 against the still Olympic-gold celebrating Americans. Ending up to the 6th place in the final standings with more goals for than against was advancing though, when one is thinking the failed tournaments of the 70’s... Maybe the teams’s talks about “beggar’s banquet” already before the tournament told the same story.\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Vladimir Myshkin; Vjatseslav Fetisov, Aleksei Kasatonov, Valeri Vasiljev, Nikolai Makarov, Zinetula Biljaletdinov, Vasili Pervuhin, Sergei Babinov, Sergei Makarov, Vladimir Petrov, Vladimir Krutov, Viktor Shalimov, Sergei Shepelev, Sergei Kapustin, Aleksander Maltsev(6+7), Vladimir Golikov, Nikolai Drozdetski, Aleksander Skvortsov, Viktor Zhluktov, Andrei Homutov, Juri Lebedev.

So, the prestigious two oldest Finnish fullroof-arens in Tampere and Helsinki shared this tournament. Team Finland gave a traditional farewell –tournament to their head-coach in his last one: a routine performance with a routine place in the final standings. The biggest vigour burning out already in the first game against Canada. They were getting over their jetlag, beating Finns by 9-2. The Finnish team was a bit too tense...\n\nIn the final series the Sovjets became the World Champions. The best Team Canada of the 1980’s was just about getting their silver-medal. The team also included a certain Wayne Gretzky, assuring, for example, a Finnish legendary whirlpool Matti Keinonen about his abilities. Though he had been skeptical in the beginning. One can also mention, that Gretzky was the top-scorer in this WC. The silver-medal would have needed a Sovjet win over Czechoslovakia. And voilá; the final game between them ended up as a tie by 0-0. They both played with that kind of style, that even a second-division Finnish team would have beaten them easily. Thanks to those division-two teams. One might wonder, why the audience was booing to the teams playing the final game. The Americans balanced the North-American performance by ending up to the pool B in the final standings. Though by coincidence in the pool A Team Italy their Italian sounded to be spoken with an American accent...\n\nTeam Finland had troubles even after the beginning. The trouble being one Erich Künhackl, but Finland won West-Germany by 4-3 in the end. After their shocking opening performance the Finnish Team had their chance to the medal rounds, though. This would have needed a victory in the final game in the first round. They did turn 1-3 to a tie 3-3. But that was it.

But all quiet on the eastern front, the Sovjets taking the gold and Czechoslovakia taking the silver. The Canadians were on a medal for the second time in a row on the Olympic and WC level. For the first time for fifteen years. The all-stars team had the following nationalities: Sovjet Union, Sovjet Union, Sovjet Union, Sovjet Union, Sovjet Union and... Sovjet Union. In this tournament the Sovjets had their 42nd win in a row. The previous record had been made between 1937-1949 and then the all-stars would have been the following: Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada and... Canada. One could sing: “…Nothing’s gonna change my world...” Despite the development of the game after the decades...\n\nWith Finland the history repeated itself with the exchange of the head-coach: first the team played suprebly against the biggest countries of hockey. And still a tie with the Swedes by 4-4 made sure a streak of not-lost games against this team for years... Then came the failures against the minor teams again. But one can say, that the newcomer had ideals. This future manager of Pori Jazz Festival and the City Theatre of Turku, Alpo Suhonen, was the first head-coach to say: Finland has taken enough influences by now and it’s about time to create an own style. But he faced the resistence of the most conservative Finnish hockey people. One reason being, that he had been serving in the military without a gun. One might think about the coaches oversees, that had never been in the military... Well, Suhonen was later a NHL-coach.\n\nSo, this tournament showed again, that Finland still had too much differences within its hockey-culture. The skillful Tampere teams(Tappara, Ilves) and Jokerit(Helsinki) here, Ässät(Pori) and HIFK(Helsinki) –club representing old-fashioned Canadian hockey there. TPS from Turku and Lukko from Rauma being something between these two extremeties. Internationally, Finland still had to face Erich Kühnhackl from West-Germany...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Vladimir Myshkin; Sergei Babinov, Zinetula Biljaletdinov, Jurek Gimajev, Vladimir Subkov, Aleksei Kasatonov, Vasili Pervuhin, Sergei Starikov, Vjatseslav Fetisov, Helmut Balderis, Vjatseslav Bykov, Andrei Homutov, Mihail Vasiljev, Viktor Zhluktov, Sergei Kapustin, Vladimir Krutov, Igor Larionov, Sergei Makarov(8+9), Aleksander Maltsev, Sergei Shepelev, Aleksander Skvortsov.

(10 2 2 6 30-40).\n\nThe Olympics\n\n1984\n\nSarajevo\n\nUnfortunately these Winter Olympics really had an Orwellian fate. Including the hockey arenas Zetra and Skenderija, not existing today anymore, or maybe as ruins. Just like the idea about Yugoslavia as the home of the southern Slavic people. But the ideals about amateur sports was cracking in this tournament too; the International Olympic Committee had variable opinions about the players of the former WHA. So was the case with the Wilson brothers too, playing in a Helsinki club called HIFK in Finland. Officially they were working in a laundry service. Naturally, the twenty-year old lieutenant-colonels of Sovjet Union and Czechoslovakia were pure amateurs again...\n\nFinland, despite being nervous this time too, had no trouble with the opening game, winning Austria by 4-3. Against Norway there was a taste of honey, victory by 16-2. Despite this, the old-timer goalie Jorma Valtonen hit his stick to pieces. The other goalie, Hannu Kamppuri, didn’t repeat his previous year’s treat, being the first Finnish goalie in the scores by having an assist. But then Canada showed its standard of players, and so did Czechoslovakia too. The US team of this tournament couldn’t handle the pressures caused by the previous Olympic tournament. But they got a tied game against Finland anyway. So Finland ended up to play for places 5-6. Then the Finnish team faced Erich Kühnhackl... and the rest of Team West-Germany. Though “The Big Eric” won the scoring stats by 8+6, he never entered the NHL. Probably thinking himself of being too slow. Strange, when thinking about the swift ones called Gordie Howe and Mario Lemieux...\n\nJust like the previous Olympic tournament, this one had no additional WC in the same year either. So Czechoslovakia didn’t get a World Champion title, ending up “only” to a silver medal. The Swedes facing “only” a bronze-medal too. In the final series they won one game, the goals-for-and-against being 3-12. So, the Sovjet Union had no trouble on their way to their sixth Olympic gold, thus equalizing their Olympic success with Canada. One can say, that they were still the only true Europeans to have won an Olympic hockey gold...\n\nUSSR: Vladislav Tretjak, Vladimir Myshkin; Aleksander Skvortsov, Vasili Pervuhin, Zinetula Biljaletdinov, Aleksei Kasatonov, Sergei Makarov, Sergei Starikov, Vladimir Krutov, Vjatseslav Fetisov, Aleksander Kozhevnikov, Igor Stelnov, Andrei Khomutov, Sergei Shepelev, Igor Larionov, Aleksander Gerasimov, Mihail Vasiljev, Nikolai Drozdetski(9+3), Viktor Tjumenev, Vladimir Kovin.(8 8 0 0 58-6).\n\n2.

(6 2 1 3 31-26).\n\nThe World Championships\n\n1985\n\nPraha\n\nDespite this tournament didn’t take place in the Olympic year, the history repeated itself in a way: though the Sovjet Union won the first round in a splendid way, Czechoslovakia won them by 2-1 on front of their home crowd, just like in 1972. This meant their World Championship title. Just like since 1983, the first round was excluded from the final standings. After the Czechoslovakian triumph, the Canadians won the Sovjets too by 3-1. For the first time in the WC-Olympic level after year 1962 Canada took the silver medal. Their success against the Sovjets was considered even in the middle of the Stanley Cup qualification rounds in North-America. The coach of the team was eagerly saying: “The thing that makes this victory even more valuable, is, that we are no super-stars. But players, who have dropped out of Stanley Cup”. A player scoring two goals against Sovjet Union was called Mario Lemieux... the Red Machine finally ended up to the bronze-medal. Them still being in shock after the game against Czechoslovakia and before a game against Canada. USA made history by being among the first four teams for the first time since Lake Placid.\n\nFinland made its best performance under the coaching of Alpo Suhonen. Despite it seemed impossible for him to gain a victory against West-Germany, Finland won Sweden twice by 6-1 and 5-0. But still even East-Germany seemed a bit hard to win. For Sweden, this was the first time since London 1937 to have a place lower than the 5th in the final standings. Norway was playing in pool B and Denmark somewhere in pool C. So, Finland was for the first time the best Scandinavian hockey country in an IIHF tournament. Well, this was the case in 1939 too. Finland being the only participant from the nordic countries... Hannu Järvenpää made Finnish history too, by being the best goalscorer of the tournament with nine goals.\n\nSo, Finland was heading upwards, despite all the difficulties. But still the spirit within the leadership of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation was: “I’ve got the puck, but I won’t pass!” How, one could see it before the next tournament...\n\nCzechoslovakia: Jiri Kralik, Jaromir Sindel; Drahomir Kadlec, Miroslav Horava, Eduard Uvira, Jaroslav Benka, Antonin Stavjana, Frantisek Musil, Radoslav Svoboda, Vincent Lukac, Darius Rusnak, Igor Liba, Jiri Hrdina, Vladimir Ruzicka, Pavel Richter, Jiri Lala(8+5), Dusan Pasek, Jiri Sejba, Oldrich Valek, Vladimir Kames, Michal Pivonka, Petr Rosol.

(10 4 2 4 39-31).\n\n1986\n\nMoscow\n\nWith new forwards in center and still the Red Machine was going on strong! During the game-nights in the Luzhniki arena there wasn’t a real doubt at any stage about the number one team of the tournament. Naturally the little harsh training and game conditions created by mr. Tihonov had affected the thing. The Glasnost hadn’t quite reached the Sovjet sports life yet. Czechoslovakia was this time playing in Finnish style and being for the first time since Cortina 1956 outside the best four teams. A cartoon was published in Czechoslovakia, where a man is shouting a Czech slogan “Do toho!” and then kicks the kicks the tv-screen in.\n\nAlpo Suhonen had had it and left his post just before the tournament. Rauno Korpi and Olli Hietanen formed the temporary coaching team called “The Korpi fire-brigade”. After hardly winning USA by 4-3 these hastedly hired coaches got their team to the medal series. For a moment the fourth place seemed to turn to a first medal ever. Then there was the second last game, Finnish team leading by 4-2 like later in the WC tournaments. There were 41 seconds left and then there were two goals scored against Finland swiftly. Well, the goalscorer was Anders Carlsson and the team was called Sweden.\n\nThen in the final game seemed to become a tie by 3-3. Then, in the 17th minute of the third period a man called Tony Tanti scored the 3-4 goal. After the Czechoslovakians and the Swedes now even Canada knew, how to get a medal with more goals against than for. After the tournament mr. Korpi was weeping, telling the audience, that one day that medal...Despite the surprisingly balcaed performance one can say, that luck played its part with this Team Finland too. Czechoslovakia failed with their training camp and the North-Americans could have assembled slightly better teams. But no question, that all the top teams had attended the tournament and so the 4th place was well deserved. In the next tournament the Finnish were weeping for some other reasons...\n\nUSSR: Vladimir Myshkin, Jevgeni Belosheikin; Vjatseslav Fetisov, Aleksen Kasatonov, Zinetula Biljaletdinov, Vasili Pervuhin, Sergei Starikov, Aleksei Gusarov, Igor Sztelnov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Sergei Makarov(4+14), Igor Larionov, Vladimir Krutov, Andrei Homutov, Vjatseslav Bykov, Viktor Tjumenev, Sergei Svetlov, Mihail Varnakov, Sergei Jashin, Juri Hmylev, Valeri Kamenski, Sergei Ageikin.

(10 4 3 3 35-34).\n\n1987\n\nVienna\n\nThe main topic of this tournament was Miroslav Sikora! And at the time of this tournament it was rather unpleasant to be Finnish. When Team Finland was surprised by West-Germany, then Kalervo Kummola of Finland, by co-incidence and in the name of fair-play, showed the records of Miroslav Sikora from the Polish national junior team. So the game was turned to Finland’s favour. The next phase took place in the court of Vienna. So, the case was turned to West-Germany’s favour again. The headquarters of the IIHF was located in Vienna at the time and this may have played its part. Kummola could have thought the reputation of the Finnish people at some point. For some reason the local audience made probably a world-record in booing, whenever Finland entered the ice. In the shadow of Sikora the all stars –team had two German players for the first time: a defenceman Udo Kiessling and a center called Gerd Truntschka, naturally from the West one.\n\nThe Sovjets got their sympathy the other way. They were the first silver-medal team ever without losing a single game! The reason being, of course, the final series without the qualification round points. The Canadians showed their spirit by playing a tie by 0-0 against the Sovjets. Then they got tired, again, and Sweden run them over by 9-0. Czechoslovakia improved their performance from last year, now entering the bronze-podium by routine. The final series without the qualification points had been used since 1983. The reason being the scandal tie by 0-0 the previous year...\n\nThinking about the Finnish performance, the Team Finland was a shadow of the one of the previous year. After this tournament Korpi went on to work for the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation and after that he went on even further with the legandary Finnish club called Tappara. Despite the routine-like performance this time the success was finally looking for Finland. It only needed a coach, putting all the necessary pieces together. Though this might have been the Finnish trouble already for some time. Like a man called Tarasov said in the beginning of the 1970’s: “How come you can assemble such a poor team from such good individuals?”...\n\nSweden: Anders Bergman, Åke Lilljebjörn, Peter Lindmark; Anders Eldebrink, Tommy Albelin, Mats Kihlström, Lars Karlsson, Peter Andersson, Robert Nordmark, Magnus Svensson, Tom Eklund, Thomas Rundqvist, Matti Pauna, Mikael Andersson, Bengt-Åke Gustavsson(3+8), Peter Sundström, Jonas Bergqvist, Lars-Gunnar Pettersson, Håkan Södergren, Lars Molin, Anders Carlsson, Peter Sandström, Håkan Loob.

(10 5 1 4 32-34).\n\nThe Olympics\n\n1988\n\nCalgary\n\nNow the Maple Leaf got such games, that were never even thought to be cancelled! But they also noticed the pressures caused by a home-crows. They began their performance,for example, by losing against Finland by 1-3. The Canadians showed their fair play spirit by getting the Finnish goalie a penalty for wearing a wrong mask. After the awkward beginning the Canadian play improved so much, that they would have deserved a bronze-medal. But a team, that lost final game by 2-9 against the Sovjets, got the position. Here’s a clue: their jersey was yellow with three blue crowns.\n\nFinland began its tournament with a traditional Finland’s North-American-tournament style; by losing by 1-2 against Switzerland. Luckily the team then beat France by 10-1. But came the promising win over Canada. Against Sweden Finland played by Swedish style; after about to lose their game by 1-3 they finally reached a tie by 3-3. Though the Finnish players were strikingly tense in their next game against Poland, they still could win by 5-1 and this made the feeling about this team being different from any previous Team Finlands. Then, in the medal-series, Finland-Germany was 8-0 for Finland. The best German effort being one shot to the pole of the cage, now without the Kühnhackl... Then Czechoslovakia won Team Finland by 5-2, the Finnish having congratulations for the debut-medal before the game. Then, the very last game against the Sovjet Union was won by Finland by 2-1. The Sovjets concentrating more on tourism. This made the Swedish press to speculate, whether the Sovjet intentionally lost their game, because of the previous year and Sikora. One official of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation, a legendary defenceman Lalli Partinen burst into tears, wondering, what made this team different. So, this fierce defenceman could have been a bit emotinonal for the first Finnish international tournament medal ever...\n\nUnlike Alpo Suhonen, Pentti Matikainen created the Finnish style of play without any declarations. And this style of play has only been developed by his successors. Though the strings of medal were waiting for some years, mr. Matikainen made a 75-percent ground-work for those successes, but the audience noticed better the 25 percent. The debut-medalists were welcome with flowers in their league-games after the tournament.\n\nUSSR: Sergei Mylnikov, Jevgeni Belosheikin, Vitali Samoilov; Vjatseslav Fetisov, Aleksei Kasatonov, Sergei Makarov, Vladimir Krutov(6+10), Igor Stelnov, Aleksander Kozhevnikov, Andrei Homutov, Igor Larionov, Vjatseslav Bykov, Aleksei Gusarov, Valeri Kamenski, Igor Kravtsuk, Ilja Prjahin, Sergei Jashin, Sergei Savetlov, Aleksander Tsernyh, Andrei Lomahin, Aleksander Mogilny, Anatoli Semjonov.

(8 4 3 1 33-21).\n\nThe World Championships\n\n1989\n\nStockholm\n\nAfter the Olympic Stadium and the traditional Johanneshov arena the Swedes got an arena nicknamed ”the greatest golf-ball in the world!” This arena was called Globen, meant for all kinds of occasions. Naturally the arena was built to the poorest end of Stockholm to make a higher profile there. The Sovjets got their higher profile by finally getting to the NHL too. So, now the Glasnost worked well. The best quintet got a permission to enter the league, but Aleksander Mogilny made history by defecting. Out of the famous five, those trained by hard facts of real life, made it very good. This wasn’t the case with Vladimir Krutov, after being taken care of for the whole of his career by the ZSKA Moscow. After this superstar flopped, he ended up to the division two in Sweden, fat and depressed. The intense concentration of the national team ended too. So, this meant the Russian gods to become mortal the next decade...\n\nFor the Canadians this was the next silver-medal tournament of this decade. Showing the signs of the next decade too. Csechoslovakia, after ending up to the fifth place in Calgary the previous year, now took the bronze-medal. Their players were looking eagerly over the ocean too. Though the consequences of a certain spring of Prague they had to wait til next fall to cross the Atlantic legally. Maybe this is why Sweden ended up to the 4th place in their domestic tournament. The previous 4th place at home for them had been in 1949. Maybe Globen demanded too much from Sweden... After being the second in the qualification group.\n\nAs an aftermath of the Olympic medal debut the previous year Finland now played a routine tournament. And Matikainen, instead of being fired, now got a post til 1992. So, this made one think, that the Finnish leadership could have improved...\n\nUSSR: Artur Irbe, Sergei Mylnikov, Vladimir Myshkin; Vjatseslav Bykov(6+6), Sergei Fjodorov, Andrei Homutov, Sergei Makarov, Valeri Kamenski, Vladimir Krutov, Dimitri Kvartalnov, Valeri Shirjajev, Vjatseslav Fetisov, Sergei Hmylev, Igor Larionov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Aleksei Gusarov, Aleksander Mogilny, Sergei Nemtsinov, Aleksei Kasatonov, Ilja Bjakin, Aleksander Tsernyh, Sergei Jashin, Svjatoslav Hasilov.

The most important change in the rosters was the adding of the thied goalie. The things changed also that way, that there were more motivated teams from North-America in the IIHF tournaments. Since more players moved overseas, the North-American style of play became more European than before. But still the Russians and the Czechs had sometimes palyers from the top European leagues...\n\nThe World Championships\n\n1990\n\nBerne, Fribourg\n\nSo, now even the Sovjets were looking for players from the NHL. The team roster happened to include also a player from the Finnish Champion, Turun Palloseura. Still the final result was the World Champion title, the last one for the name Sovjet Union. Besides this, the Canadian team was a sign for the future of these tournaments. They won their qualification group, the only lost point being a tied game against the Sovjets. But this time the motivation didn’t get them quite far enough... Canada finally ended up fourth, the star of the team being Eric Lindros. One coach had estimated him being “good in everything, but brilliant in nothing”. Eric himself said to be ready to play everything, but being a goalie. Finland played its own style again: first leading Canada by 0-4, leading then by 5-3, but finally losing by 5-6.\n\nGenerally speaking, this tournament was the weakest Team Finland performance run by head coach Pentti Matikainen. Right from the start Finland played, for example, a tied game by 3-3 against Norway. Then losing with a narrow margin against the Americans, and the same thing with USA in the second game. West-Germany played a tied game against Finland too by 1-1. This was one of Erich Kühhackl’s, the best European non-IIHF-medal winning player’s last tournaments. When Glasnost went even further than forward, that meant the end of the geographical term before the name of Germany... The string of hockey national championships stopped too with the eastern German clubs Dynamo Weiswasser and Dynamo Berlin. These two teams forming the entire East-German league.\n\nThe tournament took place in a historical hockey country, and a person from the staff of Team Finland thought the conditions being rather historical too. The arenas being modern some decades ago. In Finland a sailor had started to run a team with an NHL-model and the old arenas, covered in the early1970’s, were swiftly being modernised.

They had built an artificial ice-rink already in 1962. Covering this rink took place so late in the early 1970’s, that they had to play their home-games in Forssa, in province of Häme. Because of the appearance of their roofed arena the local people had named it as “The tin can of Kupittaa”. After being the main arena since 1973, this building was finally replaced by the World Championship arena. Because the Union Bank of Turku had purchased the rights the arena was named Typhoon. But because of the level of prices the new arena was nicknamed “Pythoon” by some people. The other nickname being, because of its appearance, “The biggest stock of grain in Turku”.\n\nThe Grand Old hosts Tampere and Helsinki shared the tournament in the qualification stage. Their old arenas, being the first ones covered right from the start in Finland, were still among the best ones in the country... This was the greatest effort for Team Finland to succeed in a domestic tournament so far. The performance being very good. But then... Sweden played against the team in Swedish style: first Finland was leading by 4-2, the game finally ending to a tie by 4-4. Sundin,scoring the last two goals, later scored a 2-1 goal to get the World Championship title to his team. They faced the already down-hill going Sovjets. Kühhackl couldn’t harm the Finnish team alone anymore... But an American called Jeremy Roenick scored a last minute goal, which meant a good-bye for Finland from the medal-series. But this time, instead of letting go, Finland played the series for places 5-8 brilliantly.\n\nIn the medal-series the Canadians made a better-than-average performance, gaining the silver medal. The Americans may have tried to help them further, but it wasn’t quite enough. Sweden played a proper game against the Sovjet Union. So, the Sovjets performed for the last time as Sovjet Union and took the bronze. This was the first World Championship for the Tre Kronor without comments about the absence of other top teams or rights of national team players. So, obviously they had a great sigh of relief...\n\nSweden: Rolf Ridderwall, Peter Lindmark; Håkan Loob, Thomas Rundqvist, Johan Garpenlöv, Per-Erik Eklund, Mikael Johansson, Peter Andersson, Tomas Jonsson, Mats Sundin(9+5), Jonas Bergqvist, Kjell Samuelsson, Charles Berglund, Calle Johansson, Bengt-Åke Gustavsson, Kenneth Kennholt, Nicklas Lidström, Fredrik Stillman, Mats Näslund, Jan Viktorsson, Anders Carlsson, Patrick Erickson, Tommy Södderström.

The French hockey team played better than for a while too; being the 8th best team. The Cold War was melting down in this tournament too, The Sovjet Union playing this tournament as the Commonwealth of Sovereign States. Then, already in the additional World Championship tournament of this year, Russia finally took the place of the USSR, though reamaining the 4th. But still in Albertville they had a golden path. The Maple Leaf created a refreshing atmosphere by gaining the silver medal. The first Olympic medal for twenty-four years, but the silver was even eight years further than that. The Finnish Team probably liked the Czechoslovakians dropping the Swedes off the medals. After Sweden had dropped Finland out of the top six by winning them by 3-2...\n\nFinland did its best to repeat the success of Clagary. But the then-trusted players were too trusted this time, being always a bit too slow. Teemu Selänne got a lot of attention. Like it happens many times, the center playing the puck for him, Mika Nieminen, remained too much as “Mika-who?”. Finally Finland remained the 7th with a slightly exhausted performance. Though in the fall of 1991, Pentti Matikainen had succeeded to coach his team to the 3rd place in the World Cup (Canada Cup at the time). The inner circle of the Finnish Ice Hockey Federation was planning to fire him again...\n\nThe IIHF was running bigger circles, starting to arrange the additional World Championship tournaments again in the Olympic years. Just like in the 1970’s, the arrangement seemed promising at the start, but very soon the tournaments of the Olympic years became tired and routine-like. The next improvement for the additional tournaments being the indipendence of Slovakia. Naturally, no-one thought money to play its part in the arrangement...\n\nThe CSS: Mihail Stalenkov, Andrei Terfilov, Nikolai Habibulin; Dimitri Mironov, Andrei Homutov(7+7), Vjatseslav Bykov, Andrei Kovalenko, Dimitri Juskevitsh, Aleksei Zhitnik, Aleksei Kovalev, Vladimir Malakhov, Darius Kasparaitis, Aleksei Zhamnov, Sergei Bautin, Igor Boldin, Nikolai Borshevski, Vjatseslav Butsajev, Jevgeni Davidov, Juri Khmylov, Sergei Peterenko, Vitali Prokhorov, Sergei Zubov.

A hockey nation with the names USSR/CSS/Russia made history by remaining the top four for the first time ever. Czechoslovakia did too, by remaining below the silver-medals for the first time at home since 1959. But they got the bronze, anyway. The Swiss Team made history by being among the best four for the first time since 1953. Maybe this tells something about the prestige of the World Championship tournaments among the top six countries in the Olympic years...\n\nThe Team Finland roster was almost totally changed after the Olympic tournament. This team winning all their games before the final. Sweden becoming the World Champion.... The team winning only one game in their qualification round, gaining one tied game and losing two. Then they played forward with the Swedish style. Team Finland, being happy about the first World Championship medal ever, lost the final. The Finnish Broadcasting Corporation had lost the rights about televising the games, when the national team was getting their medal in “the world’s most tv-like-game” ... Canada made history in this tournament by remaining outside the top six for the first time ever in an IIHF-tournament. Finland beating them in a Canadian style: Timo Peltomaa, known to be more like a rough-style player, scored a hat-trick against them. Jarkko Varvio making history too, by being the first-ever best Finnish player in total scores. Also, the all-stars of the tournament included a Finnish goalie, a defenceman and a forward for the first time. It seemed very obvious, why nobody talked now about firing the head-coach Matikainen...\n\nWithin four years Finland had made its break-throughs in the Olympic, World Championship and World/Canada Cup level. Without these performances the next Finnish national teams would have never gone as far as they did...\n\nSweden: Håkan Algotsson, Tommy Söderström, Peter Åslin; Petri Liimatainen, Fredrik Stillman, Arto Blomsten, Tommy Sjödin, Kenneth Kennholt, Peter Ottosson, Mats Sundin(2+6), Kent Roger Hansson, Patrick Carnbäck, Michael Nylander, Daniel Rydmark, Jan Larsson, Johan Garpenlöv, Peter Forsberg, Joakim Esbjörs, Calle Johansson, Anders Huss, Patrick Kjellberg, Lars Karlsson, Bo Mikael Andersson.

But this time there wasn’t such a fury at all. The former model person of communism called Boris Mihailov had now grown a hippie-hair. And coached Russia to its World Championship. After this the Sovjet/Russian hockey has had the same kind of period in the international tournaments as Canada after the 1960’s; the Maple Leaf didn’t reach real success with their first real national teams in the 1960’s and the Russians couldn’t make it anymore, after intense concentrating of the Sovjet times. Since now the ZSKA Moscow was only one of the top clubs...\n\nAnd again the Maple Leaf was brilliant in the beginning, winning its qualification group. The, in the final series, their motivation run out. In the quarter finals they could still win Finland. But then these Stanley Cup drop-outs didn’t make it either to the finals, or even to the bronze. That medal was taken by the Czech part of the former republic. Slovakia making its debut in the IIHF tournaments. To their misfortune they had to start from the pool C level. Winning their opponents by figures 20-0 the next few years may have shown their real level...\n\nFinland played a rotten tournament, ending up to the 4th place in the qualification group, even Germany did it better. Then, when the Canadians dropped Finland to the 7th place, a fierce aftermath took place. Without telling about it to the head-coach of the moment, Kalervo Kummola hired the first man he met as a new head-coach for the national team. Causing embarrassment in both countries, since Curt Lindström was considered as a has-been both in the silvery Sweden and in Finland... This swift turn might tell something about the Finnish leadership in hockey.\n\nRussia: Ilja Bjakin, Sergeri Shendelev, Andrei Trefilov; Maksim Mihailovski, Andrei Zujev, Aleksander Karpovtsev, Sergei Sorokin, Aleksander Mironov, Dimitri Frolov, Andrei Shaposnikov, Dimitri Juskevits, Igor Varitsky, Sergei Petrenko, German Titov, Andrei Homutov(5+7), Jan Kaminski, Aleksei Jashin, Sergei Putshkov, Aleksei Nikolishin, Valeri Karpov, Konstantin Astrtantsev, Vjatseslav Bykov, Vjatseslav Butsajev.

(6 2 1 3 8-12).\n\nThe Olympics\n\n1994\n\nLillehammer\n\nThe Norwegians arranged as modest Games as one can expect from a fore-running country of modern winter sports. These Games were called in a winter-like manner: “The Green Games”. In Hamar the tournament hockey games took place in a brand new arena, the main arena being the one called “Håkons-hallen”. The most innovative one was in Gjövik, bein built inside a cave. Thinking also about a possible protection of peole in the wartime...\n\nSo, many people thought the Finnish team to have a has-been as a new head-coach. Right from the start Finland had been winning Czech by 3-1, then Russia by 5-0, then Norway by 4-0... Until the Canadians could take advantage from the only murky moment of Team Finland, winning them and continuing to the final. This time Finland showed the real has-been of the tournament; winning Russia in the bronze-game by 4-0. Anything like this against the Russians had been played by Canada (1955 by 5-0) and Czechoslovakia (1974 by 7-2) in their Sovjet days. Mr. Lindström shaped the Finnish style created by Matikainen “lite bättre”, his Swedish slogan meaning “a little better”. Thus affecting more on the mental side, causing a Finnish sports commentator to say: “Whenever there is some foreigner telling to a Finnish team: “You’re so good”...” Slovakia made its debut on the pool A level very well, playing very good games, for example, against the Czech team. Reaching the 6th place in the tournament showed the start from the pool C level being exaggerated....\n\nFor the second time in a row the Canadians were trying to reach the first gold since 1952. Those days the Games were held in Oslo, Canada bein presented by the Edmonton Mercurys. The main article of the sponsor being Ford Mercury. Now those connections didn’t worry people that much. Canada was a penalty-shot away from their aim. The goalie handling the trial very well this time was called, by co-incidence, Tommy Salo...\n\nSweden: Tommy Salo, Håkan Algotsson, Mikael Sundlöv; Tomas Jonsson, Mats Näslund, Jonas Bergqvist, Charles Berglund, Håkan Loob, Daniel Rydmark, Fredrik Stillman, Patrick Kjellberg, Peter Forsberg, Kenny Jönsson, Jörgen Jönsson, Andreas Dackell, Christian Due-Boje, Niklas Eriksson, Roger Hansson, Roger Johansson, Patrik Juhlin(7+7), Leif Rohlin, Magnus Svensson, Stefan Örnskog.

The Canazei arena was like a small-town Finnish arena. This may tell something about the level of Finnish arenas. But then, on the other hand, the World Championship was used as an excuse to build a huge arena in Finland... One difference compared to the 1934 tournament was, that this one was the only World Championship one in team-sports in Italy this year.\n\nWhen the Winter Olympiad was after two years this time, naturally this was like an additional tournament. Of course the economy didn’t play any role in the IOC’s decision. Though this time the tournament wasn’t like a normal "
