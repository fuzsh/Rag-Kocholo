He won an Olympic gold in 1968 at Grenoble. He had heart issues and later that year he collapsed while playing basketball at the Spartak training ground on Vorovsky Street. A doctor on site tried to resuscitate him but he died before the ambulance arrived.\n\nThe official verdict was acute heart failure, although some said that blood was coming out of his nose and ears. Blinov was known to have been an excessive drinker in his days and had been exposed to alcohol since childhood. Reputedly according to teammates he was able to absorb more alcohol than anyone they had ever seen. Inducted into the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nBlinov\n\n1972 – Evgeny Babich [1921-1972] – Legendary national team player. He hanged himself in his bathroom at the age of 51.

He was known for never being late for trainings and always behaving impeccable. His downfall started during a trip to Finland when he was caught smuggling foreign currency at the customs, something that was a big no-no in the communist regime. He got a life suspension from hockey. At the same time his parents died. He quickly spiraled into depression and began to drink. He tried to commit suicide a couple of times and eventually hanged himself.\n\nOleg Volodyayev in the front row. Fifth from right (dark helmet).
