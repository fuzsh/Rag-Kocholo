1999–2008: Early years[]

Barys was founded on 26 November 1999 as the result of resolution accepted by the City Council of Astana.[7] The team was gathered in a semi-professional level by an enthusiast players who were annually playing an amateur tournament for the prize of Mayor of Astana and professional players who came from other teams of the Championship.[8] The team's name, Barys, is derived from the national symbol of Kazakhstan, translated as snow leopard.[9][10] Nikolai Myshagin became the first head coach in the club's history.[11] Under Myshagin rule, Barys earned silver medals in its first three season of play in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship.[12] Barys would stay there until 2009.[11] During the 2003–04 season, Barys squaded by junior players to serve as a base club for the Kazakhstan national junior ice hockey team.[11] In 2004, Barys was admitted into the Russian ice hockey system. They made their debut in the Pervaya Liga; in parallel, Barys kept a second team in the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship.[11] Barys' debut in Russia was interesting, with the team doing fairly well.[11] They played three seasons in the Pervaya Liga, where they finished respectively 3rd, 2nd and 1st of the Ural-Western Siberia Zone where they played. With this first place in 2007, Barys was allowed into the Vysshaya Liga.[11]

Barys however won the Kazakhstan Hockey Championship that year.[11] Barys' main team did not participate in the regular season of the league (however, its affiliate, Barys-2, did), but the league's format was so that the three best team of the league after the regular season would play the three best Kazakh teams (Barys' main team, Kazzinc-Torpedo and Kazakhmys Satpaev, all three were playing in the Vysshaya Liga) in the final round. Barys won the tournament, dethroning defending champions Kazzinc-Torpedo, en route to their first Kazakhstan Hockey Championship title.

In 2008, Barys applied to join the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League. The league's authorities allowed Barys in, making it the first Kazakh team to join the new league.

Arenas[]

Main articles: Kazakhstan Sports Palace and Barys Arena

At the time Barys was formed, the Kazakhstan Sports Palace just began construction. The lack of hockey rinks in Astana, forced Barys to relocate temporarily.[8] During the first two seasons of its existence, the team was based at the arenas of Temirtau, Almaty and Oskemen.[8] The Kazakhstan Sports Palace was opened on 6 March 2001 by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev with a game against Yesil Petropavlovsk.[8] It seats 4,070 in the hockey arena. In September 2011, league's authorities considered Kazakhstan Sports Palace the worst in the league.[33] The main reason was the regrettably little capacity.[34] Later, the team's owner Kazakhstan Temir Zholy decided to build the new 11,578 seat Barys Arena, which opened in 2015.[35][36]
