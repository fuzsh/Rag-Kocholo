With a career spanning over three decades, Matthews is the only player to have been knighted while still playing football, and is a legendary figure in the world of soccer.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nBorn on February 1, 1915, in Stoke-on-Trent, England, Matthews grew up in a family of football enthusiasts. From a young age, he showed a natural talent for the sport, and was playing for local teams by the time he was 15.\n\nA Stellar Career\n\nMatthews' professional career began in 1932 with Stoke City, where he would go on to play for 19 years, with a brief stint at Blackpool in between. During his time with Stoke, he helped the team win the Second Division title twice, in 1933 and 1963. With Blackpool, he reached the FA Cup final three times, finally winning the cup in 1953 in a match that would come to be known as the \"Matthews Final.\"\n\nIn addition to his club success, Matthews was a stalwart of the English national team, earning 54 caps between 1934 and 1957. He played in the 1950 and 1954 World Cups, and won nine British Home Championship titles.\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nMatthews' impressive career was recognized with numerous awards and honors. In 1956, he was named the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or, a prize given to the best European footballer each year. He was also the first winner of the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award, and was knighted in 1965 for his services to football.\n\nCoaching and Legacy\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Matthews went on to coach teams around the world, including a stint as general manager of Port Vale. He is remembered not only for his incredible skills on the pitch, but also for his tireless work promoting the sport and inspiring young players.\n\nIn 2002, Matthews was posthumously inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, a testament to his lasting impact on the sport. Today, he remains one of the most beloved and respected figures in English football history.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nPlayed for Stoke City and Blackpool between 1932 and 1965\n\nEarned 54 caps for England between 1934 and 1957\n\nWon the FA Cup with Blackpool in 1953\n\nWon the Ballon d'Or in 1956\n\nInducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002\n\nQuotes and Memories\n\nMatthews was known for his humility and kindness off the pitch, as well as his incredible skills on it. As he once said, \"I'm proud of what I've achieved, but I've never forgotten where I came from.\"\n\nThose who played with and against him remember him fondly, saying, \"Stanley was a true gentleman, and a brilliant footballer. He was an inspiration to us all.\" (Quote from Bobby Charlton)\n\nSir Stanley Matthews may have left us in 2000, but his legacy lives on, inspiring generations of footballers and fans alike."
