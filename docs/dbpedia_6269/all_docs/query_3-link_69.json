        "text": "He attacked with such pace and I believe he was more of a danger than Pele at the time—he was a phenomenon, capable of sheer magic.\n\nIt was difficult to know which way he was going to go because of his legs and because he was as comfortable on his left foot as his right, so he could cut inside or go down the line and he had a ferocious shot too.\n\nGarrincha would have been a real star today, no question about it—a superstar.\n\nWe knew Robert had talent, but the Premiership has made him take on a new dimension. It was similar for me. I remember when I arrived in England people wondered whether I was going to explode under the physical commitment.\n\nRobert has shown proof of his intelligence. Technically, he was always there, but his game has become more direct. You feel that he has become liberated on and off the pitch. He is giving everything he has. When you have technique like his, you know you can come out of things well anywhere on the field.\n\nAs a footballer it is important to be yourself and live your life—not to live in a bubble, not enjoying your life. That is what I admire about Beckham. The attention that follows him, is not easy to live out your life. But he does it.\n\nMy opinion on Robben? He was my player and I know better than many what a fantastic player he is.\n\nI also know that because of his speed and because of his creativity he is punished a lot with fouls by opponents who cannot stop him. I also know that sometimes he tries to get an advantage and he tries to get a free kick or he tries to get a penalty."
