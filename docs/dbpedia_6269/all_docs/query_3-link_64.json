An outside right forward player, he was one of the greatest dribblers in the history of football and one of the greatest players from England. He was the first from the Britain to be knighted and also the only footballer to be knighted while still active in the game.\n\nHIS-STORY :\n\nStanley Matthews was born on February 1, 1915 in Hanley town (Stoke-on-Trent) of Staffordshire county, England. He was the third son of his parents and his father was a local boxer named Jack Matthews who was popularly known as Fighting Barber of Hanley’s. Matthews joined Hanley’s Wellington Road School where he was a perfect learner. At an early age he was very fond of playing football and especially keen on his dribbling skills in school with children and countless hours in the backyard of his house.\n\nWhen he reached the age of thirteen, he has decided to become a footballer but his father wanted him to become a professional boxer and follow his footsteps. His father started training him boxing and once he was taking a rigorous training session under his father, he started vomiting. At that time his mother stood firm and convinced his father that their son should follow his own passion and become a footballer. His father recommended him to join England Schoolboy club and he received his first call-up in 1929 in a dramatic way in front of around 20,000 people at Dean Court, Bournemouth. His father died in 1945 and he made a promise on his deathbed that he would win an FA Cup final and look after his mother Elizabeth.\n\nIn 1932, he became a professional footballer and two years later played for his country for the first time in an international competition. After completing war service in the RAF in 1947, he left Stoke city and switched to Blackpool Football Club where he played for the next 14 years. Matthews then rejoined its home town Stoke City in 1961 and ended his international career as a football player in 1965.

Matthews had two children from her namely Jean and Stanley Jr. who went on to become a professional tennis player. While managing Port Vale in 1967, he met 40-year old Mila on a tour of Czechoslovakia. She was the group interpreter of the trip, while Matthews was still married, he was convinced that he had found his true love of his life in Mila. He divorced Betty and married Mila with whom he spent his remaining life. A statue of him is installed outside Stoke City’s Britannia Stadium and another one in Hanley.
