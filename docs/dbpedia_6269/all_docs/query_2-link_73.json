Repeat several times, making sure players practice faking to go both ways.\n\nTo progress, repeat the practice, but this time the players dribble the ball a short distance before attempting the Matthews Move.\n\nDevelopment\n\nPlayers split into pairs with a ball for each pair. The player with the ball dribbles towards a passive defender and performs the Matthews Move. The player with the ball and the defender both turn to face each other again. The attacker repeats the drill, but fakes to go the other way.\n\nAfter several attempts with both feet, the players switch roles.\n\nRelated Files\n\nCore-043-the-matthews-move.pdfPDF, 226 KB\n\nGame situation\n\nTwo teams of 4 players line up approx 20-25 metres away from goal. The 1st player from team A must use their skill to beat the 1st player from team B and score a goal past a goalkeeper.\n\nAfter the shot, the 1st player from team A becomes the defender in the 1v1 situation and tries to stop the 2nd player from team B.\n\nAward points for successfully creating space for the shot, and also for scoring. The team with the most points wins.\n\nWhat to call out\n\n“Start slowly at first to get technique right”\n\n“Keep the ball under close control”\n\n“Now blast past the defender”"
