        "text": "It was a game of back garden tennis that proved to be the beginning of the end of Stanley Matthews’ long football career.\n\nThe winger strained a back muscle at home in Blackpool in the summer of 1963 after he had been a major player as Stoke City won promotion back to the old Division One.\n\nHe was still in the team for a famous opening day 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, but his back trouble refused to ease, and he only made it for eight more league games and four cup ties.\n\nMatthews still had time to get on the scoresheet in a 2-2 FA Cup fifth round draw with Swansea on February 15, 1964, with what proved to be his final goal for Stoke. But by then, the Sentinel had already revealed he had “virtually retired from football after speculation dating back many years”.\n\nAn article published on Matthews’ 49th birthday, as Stoke were beating Blackburn 3-1, suggested he would only be making occasional outings from then on – to beat Billy Meredith’s record as the league’s oldest player. The Manchester City and Manchester United legend had been 49 years and 245 days old when he played his final game in 1924.\n\n“At the end of next season he will have his testimonial and leave the game which he has so superbly adorned and served for so many years,” wrote the Sentinel’s Stoke City writer Norman Gosling.\n\nIt meant that everyone knew that any game Matthews played in 1964/65 could very well be his last.\n\nAnd in the end he only played one; against Fulham at the Victoria Ground on February 6, 1965 - 54 years ago today - five days after he had turned 50 and a month after he had been knighted in the Queen’s New Year’s honours list.\n\nFulham – and full-back Jim Langley – had been keen to play their part in history.\n\nIn their own match programme a week earlier, the London club wrote: “We could not think of a finer player than Gentleman Jim to oppose the old master on what would be a memorable occasion.”\n\nSir Stan set up the second goal for John Ritchie in a 3-1 win in front of a 28,585-strong crowd, but admitted: “I was feeling swarms of butterflies in my tummy, but that is nothing new when I play.”\n\nGosling added: “It was no mere record-breaking appearance. His performance, a major contribution to victory, made the dubious enthusiastic, and his admirers over 33 years were thrilled again by the delicacy of ball control, the precise pass, the quick burst for the return and the accuracy of the placed centre. This was a great virtuoso at work.”\n\nSeven weeks later it was confirmed that Matthews had indeed hung up his boots.\n\nHe came back onto the pitch again before the final home game of season, against Sunderland on April 24.\n\n“I want to thank you all for your wonderful support,” he told fans. “Next season I will be with you all, hoping that Stoke City win the First Division championship.”"
