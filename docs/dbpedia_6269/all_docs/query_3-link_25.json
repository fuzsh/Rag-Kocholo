        "text": "Football mourned the loss of one of its most brilliant sons last night following the death of Sir Stanley Matthews, at a private hospital near his home in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nThe news of the death of one of football's greatest wingers, who became a legend during a playing career that spanned 33 years, came hours before England's friendly against Argentina at Wembley last night.\n\nBoth teams wore black arm bands for the match and a minute's silence was held before kick-off.\n\nSir Stanley, 85, a former Stoke City, Blackpool and England winger who was twice a European footballer of the year, was admitted to the North Staffordshire Nuffield hospital last week after suffering a fall at his holiday home in Tenerife, Spain.\n\nPélé once described him as the man who could show us how football should be played, and he is still considered one of the greatest players ever to grace professional football, where he became known for his mesmerising dribbling skills.\n\nHis biographer, Peter Buxton, a retired sports editor who covered Sir Stanley's halcion days as a Stoke City player, said: \"Sir Stan really was a living legend. He stood for everything that was good in sport.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Bobby Robson said: \"He had immense skill - a beautiful dribbler.\"\n\nDavid Davies, chairman of the Football Association, said: \"He was a great ambassador. He served football all over the world long after most players packed it in.\"\n\nSir Bobby Charlton said: \"I loved Sir Stanley. Magic, absolutely magical player.\"\n\nSir Stanley, who played until he was 50, later turned his hand to management with Port Vale, and was renowned for his fitness. He jogged every morning and would fast on one day a week.\n\nBut two years ago he suffered a heart attack. His wife Mila, who died last year, said then the trouble was he still thought he was 55."
