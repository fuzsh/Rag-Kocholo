        "text": "These days it's unusual for a footballer to play at the top level beyond the age of 35. Goalkeepers are an exception, of course (Brad Friedel and Mark Schwarzer are still at it in their early 40s), but for an outfield player to pick up a Premier League winner's medal at 39, as Ryan Giggs did this season, is considered little short of miraculous. That's why the achievements of Stanley Matthews continue to fascinate: still playing at 50; still scoring in the FA Cup at 49; still winning England caps at 42; still doing his bit to help Stoke City win promotion at 48 when he'd first done it 30 years previously. A geriatric's dribble isn't a pretty sight, but the midlife Matthews dribble was a work of art.\n\nEven at the time, his longevity was seen as freakish. Fans came to gawp, so they could tell their grandchildren: \"I saw Stanley Matthews in his prime.\" Speculation about when he would retire dragged on for over a decade. Aged 44, he missed half the season, because of dodgy knees and an attack of lumbago. But there were later seasons when he played in most games. After finally hanging up his boots, he reflected that he might have done it prematurely.\n\nWhat was his secret? Fitness, obviously: he came from a sporty family and was taught the importance of speed and stamina from an early age. Diet, too: while his teammates boozed and caroused, he ate salads, drank fruit juice, fasted every Monday and packed his cupboards with phials of vitamins. Self-contained, not to say aloof, he didn't much go in for team training, preferring to work out alone on Blackpool beach.\n\n\"Matthews taught us the way football should be played,\" said Pelé, and sportswriters describing his swerves and feints struggled to find the right analogy: he was a magician, they said, a pickpocket, a dragonfly, a one-man circus. Not everyone joined the adulation. Some dismissed his trickery as \"continental\", a grave offence, and his England teammate Billy Wright called him a \"pain in the neck\" because he never passed. Treading a lonely, muddy path along the touchline, he expected the ball to come to him without his having to go looking for it, and rarely if ever helped out in defence. With 71 league goals in 697 appearances, he wasn't even much of a scorer. None of this should have mattered: his gift for leaving full-backs on their backsides and delivering dangerous crosses made him invaluable to any team. He was also a money-spinner, whose appearances typically added 10,000 to a gate. But his manager at Stoke, Bob McGrory, found him too cocky, resented his stardom and was happy to sell him off to Blackpool for £11,000. Stan was 32 then, and seemingly in his twilight.\n\nIn reality, the best was yet to come. The 1953 FA Cup Final against Bolton is known as the Matthews final, since he was instrumental in helping Blackpool recover from 3-1 down to win 4-3. But that's a little unfair on the other Stanley in the team, Mortensen, whose hat-trick was no less crucial. Jon Henderson's biography describes several other matches with equal claim to be Matthews's greatest: a 5-2 defeat of Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, for instance, and a 4-2 defeat of Brazil at Wembley when he bamboozled Nílton Santos, then the leading full-back in the world. Internationals and FA cup matches brought out the best in him – and in those days the FA cup was far more prized than it is today.\n\nIn later years, Matthews was said to be picky about which matches he played in, steering clear of would-be cloggers. Opponents who went in hard were criticised even by their own fans. And referees took pains to protect him: the England full-back Ray Wilson said you only had to cough in his vicinity and the whistle would blow. By the time he played his last match he had added a knighthood to his CBE; perhaps that was why the Fulham full-back that day deferentially waved him past rather than risk damaging an icon.\n\nIn retirement, Matthews had a brief, disastrous spell as a manager of Port Vale and more successful spells coaching abroad, notably in the townships of apartheid South Africa. He also left his wife of 40 years, Betty, to take up with the four-times married Mila Winterova, who when they first met was still an agent – code name Greta – for Czechoslovakia's secret police. Though herself shrouded in secrets, Mila brought Stanley out of his shell: people found him friendlier and more relaxed. He called her the love of his life, no less so than football."
