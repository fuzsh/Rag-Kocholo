        "text": "\"The term skill refers to a player's ability to select, organize, and execute an action appropriate to a given situation in an effective, consistent and efficient manner. Skill can be distinguished from technique, which refers to a basic motor action or movement pattern. Skill is the ability to use a technique appropriately and effectively at the right moment. Techniques form the building blocks upon which skill is developed. It is therefore essential that as a result of the skill acquisition process learners know how and when to apply techniques effectively. The key features of skill are that it is:\n\nGoal Directed (Players have a purpose and know what they are attempting to do).\n\nEffective and reliable (The goal is achieved with maximum certainty and consistency).\n\nAdaptable (To meet a variety of performance contexts).\n\nEfficient (It uses no more effort than necessary).\n\nLearned (Developed with practice and experience).\" (Williams, Horn & Hodges, 2003)"
