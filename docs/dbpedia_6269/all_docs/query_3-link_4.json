        "text": "Sir Stanley Matthews remains one of England's most famous footballers and was known as the Wizard of Dribble. But he was also arguably the first global icon, paving the way for superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. And it all began in Ghana, writes Scott Anthony.\n\nFootball is the closest thing the planet has to a global popular culture.\n\nWherever you go in the world, you'll find people kicking a ball around, watching matches in cafes, wearing replica shirts, and betting or playing football games on their phones.\n\nYet the idea of a footballer as a global icon is a relatively recent phenomenon. The idea that a footballer could bring nations, classes and races together had to be invented. And it was an idea that was arguably invented in Africa.\n\nThe story begins 60 years ago in Ghana when veteran English footballer Stanley Matthews strode out to play for Accra's Hearts of Oak against Kumasi Kotoko.\n\n\"Matthews' visit had a tremendous impact,\" says football writer Fiifi Anaman. \"When I spoke with some of the players about it, they said they couldn't believe Matthews came - it felt almost as if a god was walking among them.\"\n\nThe media had hyped up the visit, speculating how local hero Baba Yara, \"Ghana's King of Wingers\", would measure up against the superstar of European soccer.\n\nMatthews was mobbed on arrival and more than 80,000 spectators turned up to watch his first three matches against Kotoko, Sekondi Hasaacas and Kumasi Cornerstone.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Matthews was presented with an ivory sword and installed as a \"soccerhene\" (soccer chief) in front of the press.\n\nEven more importantly, Matthews arrived as Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah, was trying to create an identity for Ghana - a country knitted together from numerous different ethnic groups under colonial rule.\n\nRemoving the portrait of Elizabeth II from stamps and coins was easy but it was more difficult to create new symbols capable of bringing the new nation together.\n\nIn particular, President Nkrumah stressed the need for real-life examples. He wanted to emphasise the idea that you live your values rather than passively inherit them.\n\nThe success of Matthews' tour helped convince Mr Nkrumah that sport could also play a significant role in the dissemination of African values.\n\nAt this defining moment, Matthews was playing alongside the early greats of Ghanaian football such as James Adjaye, Chris Briandt and CK Gyamfi, who would go on to define that greatness.\n\nUltimately, Ghana's president believed that sport was the perfect vehicle for the expression of pan-African idealism.\n\n\"By meeting together in the field of sport,\" Mr Nkrumah said, \"the youth of Africa will learn what our elders were prevented from learning - that all Africans are brothers with a common destiny.\"\n\nIn the years immediately after independence, Ghanaian football would not only serve as a vehicle for the development of what the president termed \"the African personality\" but be invested with the hope that it could help build a new kind of global solidarity.\n\nThe England international, aged 42 when he arrived in Ghana, was a compelling if unusual figure.\n\nHe had become a celebrity during World War Two when Allied authorities promoted the matches of touring All Star XIs to keep up morale in war zones.\n\nHere Matthews was a propagandist's dream. In addition to his amazing dribbling ability, he was never booked and lived an ascetic life. The contrast between Matthews' modesty and the icons of Fascist sport could not be clearer.\n\nIn later life he favourably contrasted the collective spirit of African football, especially in Soweto, with the economic bigotry he saw taking over the game in the UK.\n\n\"Going into the townships at a time when racial discrimination was at its most intense [was] something that had all kinds of ramifications,\" remembered Archbishop Desmond Tutu. \"It made a dent in the apartheid armoury.\"\n\nIn Ghana, President Nkrumah's politicisation of football would prove a double-edged sword, as the regime's centralising and authoritarian tendencies eventually brought the league into disrepute and fanned regional factionalism.\n\nInternationally, however, African governmental activism broke the European and South American duopoly over football and in the process the idea that football was an uncontainable and universalising global force was born.\n\nScott Anthony is a fellow at the Johannesburg Institute of Advanced Study"
