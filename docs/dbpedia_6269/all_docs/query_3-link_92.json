        "text": "As others have said it's difficult to judge, but I'm honestly doubtful his highest level of performance came at this time.\n\nNo doubt he achieved recognition and fame for still being a great player at a late age though, and he is most often recognised for his performance in the 1953 FA Cup Final. He was a star in both the 30's (including a noted performance away in Germany) and the 40's during possibly England's most successful period albeit in 'friendly' matches mainly (4-0 in Italy, 10-0 in Portugal etc).\n\nHe sometimes switched to playing as inside-forward I believe during a game and he was an ok goalscorer (some footage on a video posted by Excape Goat on the All-Time Draft Selection thread shows a left footed finish after running through in the inside left channel and a free-kick goal IIRC). However, clearly his main asset was assisting goals - he was pretty much the opposite of Cristiano Ronaldo in terms of aims and playing style I think for example.\n\nWingers were mainly providers for the inside and centre-forwards in the era he played in - his goalscoring record isn't as good as Tom Finney's but he played less as an inside forward (Finney even played for his club as a deep-lying centre-forward late in his career). Numorous people do rate Finney above Matthews within England I think including those around when they played but as many or more probably rate Matthews ahead and he's the more famous worldwide. I think Finney is seen as more complete, though as good as his dribbling and assisting was (and he was more two-footed, pretty much equally good with right and left) most people see Matthews as the best in terms of his wingplay - he's known as the Wizard of the Dribble.\n\nIf there's a player who did peak at such a late age, I'd suggest perhaps Roger Milla rather than Stanley Matthews .\n\nVery hard to judge but I'd feel top 30 all-time might be more realistic than top 20. If longevity was given a big weighting then top 20 might become more realistic and ditto greatness in own era, fame etc.\n\nHere's a paragraph I found to illustrate the point I was making:\n\n\"\n\nThe pre-match line-up of the teams seemed to justify Hitler's assertions of German superiority, for the bronzed, smart and fit-looking German players contrasted favourably with the less impressive appearance of their English counterparts, who had just completed a long and arduous season. However, once the match commenced and the early German attacks had been foiled, the English team began to assume the upperhand, with Stanley Matthews prominent on the right wing. He sped past Muenzberg, and centred for his fellow winger, Cliff Bastin, to force the ball home after Len Goulden's initial shot had been parried. But a German equaliser scored by one of the Austrian players, Pesser, threatened to turn the game until two goals in five minutes, first by Jackie Robinson and then by Frank Broome, restored England's control of the match, a point confirmed by Matthew's dazzling run through the opposing defence for the fourth goal. Although the Germans pulled a goal back just before half-time, Robinson resumed the goal-scoring soon after the interval. Then Pesser capitalised upon an error by Vic Woodley in the England goal to bring the score back to 5-3, but before the end of the game Matthews, as if to cap a superlative performance, combined with Goulden, who scored perhaps the best goal of an exciting and skilful match.\"\n\nIt was taken from this page which is otherwise focused on propaganda etc in football:\n\nhttp://www.historytoday.com/peter-beck/england-v-germany-1938-football-propaganda\n\nMatthews is certainly more famous but I find it difficult to rate his performance. He played after all not in the most successful era of the NT.\n\nTelling for his fame is that a certain Fons Van Brandt marked him two times out of the game. Van Brandt was for a week a national hero. Also goalkeeper Pol Gernaey became famous for saving a shot of Matthews (Matthews congratulated him during and after the match). Matthews was also the idol of Sjaak Swart and an example for Coen Moulijn.\n\nMatthews was certainly a very sportsmanlike figure and a gentleman. Maybe he was also a bit patronising but I recently read the book that was published to commemorate the 50 years existence of the Dutch FA (with attention for the Belgians) and also they were in 1948 still very convinced of British superiority in football.\n\nIf you contrast his gentleman-like behaviour with the attitude of Pelé then it becomes apparent what I mean. Pelé played in 1963 with Brazil a match against the Netherlands. Rinus Bennaars tracked him and marked him out of the game, with fair means. Pelé could not appreciate this though and stepped after 30 minutes out of the pitch, and did not came back.\n\nThat was partly the reason I felt it would be wrong to assume Matthews (plus probably Finney and Mortensen too; I dunno maybe not Mortensen) were at their very best in the 50's. Especially at International level Finney and Matthews would seem to have shone more in the 40's.\n\nHowever:\n\n1) The likes of Tommy Lawton, Wilf Mannion and Neil Franklin played for England in the 40's but weren't part of the team in the 50's.\n\n2) England's results in the 40's were, except for British Championships, officially in friendlies though maybe more like Test Matches in Cricket ie not just warm-up games for tournaments like nowadays so the best teams would be picked mainly. Some of the results in the 50's were also very good (wins over Germany, Brazil etc) in contrast to the World Cup results in the main. The Munich disaster and losing the likes of Duncan Edwards is a factor for the '58 World Cup though.\n\n3) The Hungarian 'Magic/Magnificent/Mighty Magyar' side was clearly very high quality and was getting generally great results so England were just not an exception. From the highlights I saw of the Wembley game, Matthews did seem to show his age a little in terms of his style of play possibly but as you said he wasn't the reason for the loss and it's true that the FA Cup Final months prior to that was a great game for him and he was still able to dribble very well and pick out passes/crosses very effectively at that time. Maybe the 40's England team with younger wingers Finney and Matthews plus Tommy Lawton up front etc would've seemed a closer match for Hungary but I'm sure Hungary would still have excelled in any match-up billed as the Game of the Century.\n\n4) The Uruguayan side which knocked England out in 1954 gave Hungary (without Puskas) a close game too.\n\nHmmm, in the 1940s the international scene was basically non-existent or very minimal. You had those war years and the first couple of years afterwards were also not very prosperous. Some Dutch and Belgian international games were cancelled because of a lack of interest of the public and a lack of funds/priority. I think the rest of war torn Europe had also their problems in sports. So I'm a bit curious about what Matthews and Finney did in that decade.\n\nIf I took a look at the 1950s squads I see indeed no Mannion etcetera but I do see familiar names as Billy Wright, Nat Lofthouse, Jim Dickinson and Tommy Taylor (maybe I overlooked some). Dunno about the strength of the water carriers though.\n\nAbout the Hungary match: I read a piece of Glanville where he had the theory that the Swedish team were able to reach a draw because they essentially marked some key players of Hungary's system out of the game. England played a few weeks later against Hungary. I sensed that it was according to him more of a matter of tactics than quality although this can also be a bit too nostalgic from his side.\n\nAnyhow, in the 1940s and 1950s it seems there was not much opportunity to show themselves on the international stage. In the 1950s the age was maybe a factor, as you have said before.\n\nOf course, you cannot blame single individuals for playing with 'bad' team-mates and therefore a lack of success. On the other hand, there are zillion great footballers from smaller countries (Sweden, post 1940s Austria, Scotland for example) who do not get a great amount of recognition too, because they also had to play with less-gifted team-mates or a squad that lacked depth. Hence, sometimes I feel that English players are sometimes a bit overrated (or others underrated, depending on the perspective). Same with Italian defenders in general. It seems to be the case though that the failures of England cannot be blamed on Matthews, and that should be appreciated I think.\n\nMaybe your rating is wrong. In the aforementioned book to commemorate the 50 years existence of the Dutch FA he (Matthews that is) is named as the best wing-player in Europe. A verdict made in 1948, thus before the famous Matthews final.\n\nAnd as said before, players marking him out of the game reached the frontpage.\n\nMaybe he was not by miles the best in a year, but he was I think certainly of a Figo like level, and that for a decade, if not more.\n\nWhen WWII started he was 24. He was 30 when it ended. It cost him the whole peak of his career.\n\nHe was already 38 by the time of the '53 Matthews final, and 42 when he last played for England.\n\nWhile he played on, still playing for Stoke (in Div 2) until he was 48, albeit with one final game aged 50, it would be fair to say that he was past his best in the 1950s.\n\nIt's likely he was one of the very best players in the game in the 1930s (with less competition) and would probably have been so in the 1940s if war hadn't got in the way, but would have inevitably declined as he got older.\n\nTo be honest I think it's perhaps unlikely that he's in the 20 best players of all time, but he was good enough to be worthy of consideration when drawing up such a list.\n\nThe question would be how such a list was compiled.\n\nFurther down there are awards for the world's best players in each position. In 1917 it lists Italian defender Renzo di Vecchi as the world's best, and award he picks up in three further seasons.\n\nItalian football was crap in that era. Just four years earlier my team Reading - not even in the football league at the time - went to Italy and beat the full Italian team (including di Vecchi) 2-0. Milan were beaten 5-0, Genoa 4-2 and even Pro Vercelli were beaten 6-0.\n\nI would suspect more than a certain level of bias has gone into those awards, or Italian players of the era would get nowhere near, which makes them a rather poor reflection of talent.\n\nIf it's just a list you've made up it hardly amounts to evidence of Matthews being restrospectively overrated, just your lower opinion of him.\n\nWere the 1930s less competitive, in terms of domestic club football? Why?\n\nEngland's friendlies up to the end of the mid 1930s.\n\n95 06.06.1908 Vienna Austria 6- 1\n\n96 08.06.1908 Vienna Austria 11- 1\n\n97 10.06.1908 Budapest Hungary 7- 0\n\n98 13.06.1908 Prague Bohemia 4- 0\n\n102 29.05.1909 Budapest Hungary 4- 2\n\n103 31.05.1909 Budapest Hungary 8- 2\n\n104 01.06.1909 Vienna Austria 8- 1\n\n126 21.05.1921 Brussels Belgium 2- 0\n\n132 19.03.1923 Highbury Belgium 6- 1\n\n134 10.05.1923 Paris France 4- 1\n\n135 21.05.1923 Stockholm Sweden 4- 2\n\n136 24.05.1923 Stockholm Sweden 3- 1\n\n138 01.11.1923 Antwerp Belgium 2- 2\n\n141 17.05.1924 Paris France 3- 1\n\n143 08.12.1924 West Bromwich Belgium 4- 0\n\n146 21.05.1925 Paris France 3- 2\n\n150 24.05.1926 Antwerp Belgium 5- 3\n\n154 11.05.1927 Brussels Belgium 9- 1\n\n155 21.05.1927 Luxembourg Luxembourg 5- 2\n\n156 26.05.1927 Paris France 6- 0\n\n160 17.05.1928 Paris France 5- 1\n\n161 19.05.1928 Antwerp Belgium 3- 1\n\n165 09.05.1929 Paris France 4- 1\n\n166 11.05.1929 Brussels Belgium 5- 1\n\n167 15.05.1929 Madrid Spain 3- 4\n\n171 10.05.1930 Berlin Germany 3- 3\n\n172 14.05.1930 Vienna Austria 0- 0\n\n176 14.05.1931 Paris France 2- 5\n\n177 16.05.1931 Brussels Belgium 4- 1\n\n180 09.12.1931 Highbury Spain 7- 1\n\n184 07.12.1932 Chelsea Austria 4- 3\n\n186 13.05.1933 Rome Italy 1- 1\n\n187 20.05.1933 Berne Switzerland 4- 0\n\n190 06.12.1933 Tottenham France 4- 1\n\n192 10.05.1934 Budapest Hungary 1- 2\n\n193 16.05.1934 Prague Czechoslovakia 1- 2\n\n195 14.11.1934 Highbury Italy 3- 2\n\n198 18.05.1935 Amsterdam Netherlands 1- 0\n\n200 04.12.1935 Tottenham Germany 3- 0\n\nAlso...\n\n20.04.1908 Germany, Berlin 5-1\n\n13.03.1909 Germany, Oxford 9-0\n\n14.04.1911 Germany, Berlin 2-2\n\n21.03.1913 Germany, Berlin 3-0\n\nSo who are these 10 strong nations England avoided playing?\n\nUruguay, yes, but Olympics & WC apart, Uruguay themselves didn't play a non-South American team until 1961."
