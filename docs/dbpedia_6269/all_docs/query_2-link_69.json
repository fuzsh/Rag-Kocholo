The large-scale project required a substantial quantity of flooring to meet the daily demands of use by students and staff.

        "text": "The construction of an ultramodern education centre has provided a permanent tribute to one of football’s greatest players. Sir Stanley Matthews Academy in Stoke-on-Trent, the birthplace of the late Stoke City and England winger, established a fitting tribute upon its opening in May 2014.\n\nThe expansive site accommodates 1050 students and holds Business & Enterprise Maths Specialist Academy status. Ormiston Academies Trust (OAT) funded the £19m new build project. This innovative not-for-profit organisation is one of the largest multi-academy trusts in England. The academy forms part of the UK Government’s Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative.\n\nThe project was designed and specified by Associated Architects, Birmingham. It features over 4500m2 of Polyflor products across its substantial floor space, all installed by Westcotes Flooring Company, Leicester. The design team at Associated Architects favoured two Polyflor products: Classic Mystique PUR and Polysafe Vogue Ultra PUR.\n\nClassic Mystique PUR met the demands of this high-traffic environment. Across all circulation areas, it demonstrated incredible durability, abrasion resistance, lifelong polish-free maintenance and optimum appearance retention. Aesthetically, it provided a tonal, non-directional appearance, with a perfectly balanced blend of neutral colours and warmer tones. It is also 100% recyclable via Polyflor’s Recofloor scheme.\n\nThe similarly appealing Polysafe Vogue Ultra PUR was the preferred flooring across the academy’s stores, classrooms and laboratories. This robust, textured and hygienic product offered a selection of colours, adding individuality across each location.\n\nIn its continued efforts towards sustainability, these Polyflor materials achieved individually certificated British Research Establishment (BRE) Global A+ ratings, contributing towards the overall project’s ‘Very Good’ BREEAM rating.\n\nToday, the Sir Stanley Matthews Academy instils ambition within its pupils daily, maintaining a lasting legacy for its namesake."
