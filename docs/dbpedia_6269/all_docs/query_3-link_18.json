        "text": "Sir Stanley Matthews, a legendary figure in British soccer who played professionally until he was 50 years old and was the first pro soccer player to be knighted, died yesterday at a hospital in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England. He was 85.\n\nIn a career that spanned more than three decades, Sir Stanley was one of soccer's premier players, renowned as the Wizard of Dribble for his playmaking skills. He was also known as the First Gentleman of Soccer, having never received a warning from a referee or been expelled from a game for rough play.\n\nPlaying outside right, Sir Stanley was the first Englishman to be named European Footballer of the Year, achieving the honor twice. His signature game was the 1953 Football Association Cup final when, at age 38, he set up the last three goals, enabling Blackpool to defeat the Bolton Wanderers, 4-3, before a crowd of 100,000 and Queen Elizabeth II at Wembley Stadium in London. That game, bringing Blackpool its first title, became known as ''the Matthews final.''\n\nWhen he retired in 1965, having played 33 seasons, he had made some 700 league appearances, for Stoke City and Blackpool, and had played in more than 50 games for England in international matches."
