        "text": "Valis III (PC Engine CD)\n\nThe first traditional action-platformer in the series; the base of your sword actually deals damage. It's definitely a step up visually from the previous game, having a lot more color and sprite animation. The story, what little is there, does finally add some world building and feels like a modest send off for the original protagonist. The music is solid, but like the previous entry, doesn't quite match the original game in the series. The first level is definitely catchy though.\n\nIt might be the most ambitious yet in the series in terms of gameplay, but it doesn't ever feel like it does much with those ideas or outright stumbles. Three separate playable characters, but they all mostly play the same in the majority of situations. You can alter your jump height slightly by holding up, but it adds nothing as the way platforms are spaced, you still have to be directly underneath (not jumping in an arc) to clear them. Sliding is also a mechanic, but it feels more like it's used for sliding on air to reach a nearby platform than in combat as it has some weight to it. Magic has secondary uses, such as freezing enemies to create platforms, but as magic ammo is limited and your attacks can destroy the frozen enemy while standing on it, it feels half-baked.\n\nAttack strength is determined by a meter; the longer you wait to attack, the stronger your next attack will be. While in theory this works as a mechanic, the game isn't balanced around it unlike some other series that have used this. Enemies are balanced around the maximum power and not the minimum power, so you get situations where minor enemies gang up on you and you can't fight back fast enough, or if you have to attack while moving/platforming, an attack you thought would kill an airborne enemy didn't and now you've fallen into a pit. You also have the Weapon Level mechanics of the previous games, so if you die, you're back down to zero in the middle of a boss fight.\n\nThis tends to be the most talked about game of the series, but I don't quite see it. I definitely want to like more, but the innovations that are often cited, I feel half-baked. Also the last two bosses are completely broken and full of attacks I have no idea how you can reasonably dodge. Ex. The second to last boss attacks you like the Yellow Devil, but with no set pattern, larger hitboxes, takes more hits, etc.\n\nValis IV (PC Engine CD)\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is probably the most sound of the series and feels the most put together. Three separate characters, but they each have their own attributes and attacking strengths. The level design is dynamic, varied, and rewards you for experimenting with characters. Controlling characters feel like they have just about the right amount of weight (except for Amu's second jump, which has incredibility strict timing). While you still have to deal with Weapon Levels (that sadly determines HP size), Magic has a meter that charges on it's own (though getting hit by an enemy resets it to zero).\n\nOn a base gameplay perspective, I think this is the best of the series. The story and presentation is also pretty solid; I honestly think I like Lena's journey more than any of Yuko's. The music is also hard early 90s, with a lot of electronic instruments and guitar solos. The caveat unfortunately is just how long and hard the game is. It's the hardest of the series by a fair margin with enemies ganging up on you constantly and appearing out of nowhere. The levels themselves are also twice as long as previous entries, and the final boss feels almost impossible even with Save States/Rewind. The game, somehow though, has a secret hard mode (requiring a 2nd controller to access/cannot be accessed on the Debug Menu) with hidden extra levels after the end-credits with a new boss as well. My goodness.\n\nValis Collections - Only Volume 1 is really worth anyone's time, if curious about the series or if you want to see what the PC Engine has to offer, it's probably worth it if it goes on sale. For whatever reason, even though only 1.5 of the games are good to decent, Volume 2 costs $5 more than Volume 1. Definitely only buy it if you're a diehard collector or if it's on sale for $15 or under (which is how much Valis IV costs by itself on the eShop).\n\nValis I/Valis IV > Valis II/Valis III >> Valis 1 (Genesis) >>>> Valis (MSX)/Syd of Valis IMO\n\nPersona 4 Arena: Ultimax (played on Switch)\n\nI didn't touch the game's online mode, and I only did one run of arcade mode, but I beat the four story modes 100%.\n\nThe game's fun to play, and it's well written (especially by the normal standards of fighting games), with the various stories giving us insight into the mindsets of the various Persona characters. However, the stories can be a little repetitive at times, especially Episode P4A which covers the events of Persona 4 Arena, this game's predecessor.\n\nHowever, the story modes outside of Episode P4A spoil major twists in Persona 3 and 4, and even some of the P4A stories heavily imply major spoilers for those games (mainly Persona 3). This means that a pair of 80 hour RPGs are almost required to play through before playing this game, making it hard to recommend for newcomers to the series who want to ease in with a fighting game spin-off.\n\nThe gameplay's accessible, with relatively simple controls and a story mode that's fairly easy to complete. (Though trying to 100% complete the Persona 4 story almost requires a guide) There are still some modes that I only scratched the surface of, but all in all, it's a fun game, though definitely not one that I'd recommend for beginners to the franchise.\n\nDuckTales Remastered (played on Steam)\n\nLife is like a hurricane here in Duckburg. Racecars, lasers, aeroplanes - it's a duck blur!\n\nI decided to play the game after having it in my Steam library for a while, and I've been hooked for the past day or so. I played through the game on Normal difficulty, and it's generally been a fun experience, with fairly short levels and a reasonable difficulty for the most part.\n\nThe music is a highlight - the Moon theme is a standout, but all of the levels are great in that regard. The gameplay is smooth, with Scrooge's pogo jumps feeling satisfying, and the animations are great. Plus, they brought back the surviving voice cast, which makes the whole experience feel like a controllable cartoon episode.\n\nMy only problem is the final level, where the difficulty takes a massive leap upwards. I haven't played the NES game, so maybe that whole game was like this originally, but while earlier levels had a few instant death obstacles, the final level is filled to the brim with them, while you only get three lives to beat the level with. (Which, in addition to those instant death obstacles, includes a race where losing it costs you a life and an escape sequence that requires fast, accurate platforming over a rising lava pit when the game was previously much more forgiving) I'm guessing it's even more difficult on Hard or Extreme, but even on Normal, it was a frustrating experience.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the game and I'm glad that I gave it a try. It's impressive to see how well the game holds up considering that it's a remastered version of an NES licensed game, which (from what I've seen) usually aren't held in high regard.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. (played through Super Mario All-Stars on the SNES Online app on the Switch)\n\nFull disclosure, I abused the rewind system. I only kept track of my deaths in the final two worlds, but in those cases, I died 35 times, which feels like a lot given how few lives you get.\n\nI had fun with the game - it's a classic for a reason, and the controls are pretty smooth, though I had trouble with getting the timing down for the springs. Most of the time, my deaths felt like my fault rather than the game being cheap, though there were some cases where I died repeatedly to Hammer Bros. the flame pillars in Bowser's castle, or a cannon firing two Bullet Bills back to back.\n\nA highlight was World 8-2, where it honestly felt like Bowser was throwing his whole army at me at once, which is impressive for an NES game. The game's tough, and there are some odd bits that only seem to be included in order to ramp up the difficulty (such as Mario turning back into small Mario when he's hit in any form), but I enjoyed my playthrough.\n\nStreets of Rage 4 (played on Switch)\n\nI beat the game, but I feel like I've only scratched the surface. It's a fun beat-em-up, though I'm lacking the history with the franchise, so I might be missing out on some of the excitement, but the gameplay feels smooth, nothing really felt cheap, and there's a TON of unlockable content (every version of every playable character from the past three Streets of Rage games can be unlocked here, even the boxing kangaroo). The game would likely be even better in co-op, though I didn't get the chance to try that out.\n\nLego Batman 2 (played on Xbox 360)\n\nI've never really gotten into the Lego games, but I gave this one a shot and I loved it. The gameplay's straightforward, but the open world is big enough that there's plenty to explore but not so big that it's overwhelming, going for 100% completion felt natural rather than seeming like a chore, and being able to patrol the city with the Danny Elfman theme playing in the background or fly through the city as Superman with John Williams's theme at full volume elevates the whole experience tremendously.\n\nPerfect Dark (played on Xbox 360)\n\nThis was one of the Rare games that I missed out on in the Nintendo 64 days; I had Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, Donkey Kong 64, and Diddy Kong Racing, but I didn't get Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, or Conker's Bad Fur Day. This makes the Xbox 360 version my first experience with the game, and it's nearly perfect. (my only issue is that sometimes, the objectives are unclear, leading to a lot of confusion on my part when I first played through some levels)\n\nJoanna Dark is a fun protagonist, and it's a shame that we haven't gotten more games in that series (aside from Perfect Dark Zero, which was poorly received compared to the original, though I'm still going to give it a chance). The other characters aren't as memorable (aside from Elvis - no, not that one), but it's still a fun spy-themed romp with a lot of twists and turns in the plot.\n\nI don't play many first person shooters (I tried Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, hearing that it was one of the best in the series, but a mission in Brazil was frustrating enough that I stopped playing the game), but Perfect Dark had great level design, with the auto aim making it a lot easier for me to get into. Also, the enemies generally stood out from the environment, and you can take enough damage that the game never really feels unfair, at least from what I've played of the Agent and Secret Agent difficulties.\n\nThe multiplayer has a lot of options - aside from split-screen death matches (or matches with bots, which is a nice inclusion), there are challenges that can be completed in solo or co-op, along with being able to play through the entire campaign in co-op mode or what the game calls \"counter-op mode\". (though I'm not sure if if the campaign playthroughs are limited to two players or not) In addition, as you play through the campaign or challenges and find weapons, you can use those weapons in multiplayer, allowing for a wide variety of gameplay types.\n\nThe game has a wide variety of achievements (20 in total, which seems like a lot for an Xbox Live Arcade game, in addition to in-game awards where you need to collect most of them for one of those achievements), though unlike the similar ports of Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, I'm not going to aim for all of the achievements. Some of them require impossibly precise coordination in co-op mode, while others require you to beat AI that outright cheat at the game.\n\nAlso, as a heads up: this game has some bonuses that you can get by having played Crackdown 2 and Perfect Dark Zero on the same account (a multiplayer character for Crackdown 2, and unlocking some cheats early/easily for Perfect Dark Zero), but for Perfect Dark Zero, your PDZ save file needs to have been created before your Perfect Dark save file in order to unlock the cheats. For some reason, they won't unlock if you play Perfect Dark Zero after playing Perfect Dark.\n\nLegend of Zelda Tears of The Kingdom\n\nThe Good\n\nIn many ways this is an incredible game. It takes what was great about Breath of the Wild and expands upon it in every way. They basically made a physics sandbox full of contraptions that you can glue together like planes, boats and cars and filled it full of little puzzles. It also scratches the open world itch really well with tons of ingredients to collect and cook for different effects, upgrade materials, and parts to improve your weapons with. Huge world with a sky and underground section that weren't present in the first game and tons of stuff to do. You have an enormous amount of freedom as most walls in the overworld can be climbed. You're not boxed in by mountains like a lot of games.\n\nThe Bad\n\nUnfortunately there are several things holding TotK back from a perfect score. Little Nintendoisms where Nintendo refuses to enter the 2020s.\n\nThe most predominant is that you are constantly micromanaging your inventory. Weapons break so quickly and although there is a new fusing mechanic where you can fuse monster parts and other weapons together it doesn't solve the issue. If anything it makes it worse as you can't do this from the menu. This means every new weapon, you must pick out a part from your inventory, toss it on the ground, and use the fuse rune to make a weapon worth using. This sucks if you need a new weapon during a battle and it's realistic to go through three weapons on a single group of enemies. In caves you need to make hammers by fusing a rock to a weapon to break down stone walls but you can easily go through six to a dozen weapons in a single area. You can also fuse parts to arrows for various effects. The issue with this is that you have to scroll through all your items, and there are hundreds, to find the part you want. You'll never fuse a fish or an apple to an arrow so why give you the option to do it?\n\nYou can make a lot of cool machines but they break after about a minute and a half so that really dampens the extent of what you can do. Would it be so horrible to just let you fly around the map?\n\nThe upgrade materials for armors are the same things you use to cook and improve weapons with. This means that you can easily waste a rare resource needed for armor. Or sell it for money. I never ended up making the most powerful weapons from monster parts because I was afraid I'd need them for upgrading. And on that note, monsters have rare drops which are too rare. If you want to upgrade the best armor you need 15 lynol guts but that can easily mean having to hunt 30-45 lynols because guts have bad drop rates. In my experience.\n\nThe voice acting is done really half-assed. Cutscenes are fully voice acted but everything else is written text with grunts. Also they didn't hire the best actors, notably Zelda doesn't give a very realistic performance.\n\nStory\n\nThe story is the same damn story as EVERY SINGLE LoZ GAME. Yes it has a little twist but come up with a new story FFS Nintendo. Ganon's the bad guy despite being the bad guy in the last game (which is never explained) and he's so 2-dimensional and stale. I've complained before about Nintendo being against unique characters and fresh stories.\n\nAnd a minor complaint, the game looks good but not amazing. There are some games like Horizon where I think 'damn this looks gorgeous' and this is not one of them. They decided to go with a cell shading art style that dates back to the game cube era.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nUltimately the game's strength are incredibly strong, it's a huge game full of creativity and fun. I really want to give this a perfect score but there are just too many flaws that make it not as good as games like Horizon or Elden Ring.\n\n9.5/10\n\nSam & Max Save The World (a.k.a. season 1 - played on Xbox 360)\n\nI wasn't sure if I'd played through season 1 before, but I had a great time with it. It's a humorous point-and-click adventure game in the style of older LucasArts games like Monkey Island, and I find it a bit of a shame that Telltale seemingly never went back to this style after the success of The Walking Dead. (it's understandable, but variety is the spice of life)\n\nOut of the six episodes, the highlight for me was definitely episode 4, or \"Abe Lincoln Must Die!\" The puzzles all felt natural, whereas there were some cases in other episodes where I needed to look up what to do. (the results made sense in hindsight, like putting a bug into a virtual world in order to mess up some aspect of it or using a coathanger to unlock a vehicle door that had its window slightly rolled down, but the game never gave any indication that these were even possible)\n\nThe writing was stellar and downright hilarious, with it easily being the main reason to play these games. The achievements were easy enough to get, though a bonus achievement in the last episode (where you have to show ten characters an item) can be kind of tricky given that you have certain limited windows of opportunity to make progress with it. It was funny, relaxing, and overall, I enjoyed myself immensely. (though I won't jump straight into season two - I learned from Fire Emblem that playing two games of the same genre/series really close together can lead to burn-out)\n\nLego Batman 3 (played on Xbox 360)\n\nI enjoyed this game, though not as much as Lego Batman 2. The open world aspect is gone, and replaced with a hub world. The hub world can still be fun to explore, but I preferred the open world from the last game since it allowed for lots of exploration without being so big that it was overwhelming.\n\nThis game has more of a focus on the Justice League, particularly with the Green Lantern side of things. (five of the last six levels deal with the Green Lantern mythos) It's good, and I love the added focus on Adam West's Batman, though I'd recommend the second one over this.\n\nYoshi's Story (played on Wii U)\n\nIt's a fun, short, simple game. Aiming the eggs on the Wii U can be a little clunky (you have to move the right analog stick to activate egg-aiming mode, but you have to actually aim it with the left analog stick), but it's charming, even if the level ending music can be more than a little grating on the ears.\n\nThere's a difficulty spike in the last level, but it was still enjoyable, and I liked the underwater level, which could get pretty tense at times given that you're limited in terms of being able to defend yourself. (unless there was something that I missed) The platforming was fun, and it seems like there's a good amount of level variety, though there's the kind-of odd decision to make it so you can only play one level (of a max of four) per chapter/area before it moves on. (so, for example, you have access to levels 1 and 2 in chapter 2 - if you pick level 1 and beat it, it moves on to chapter 3)\n\nThe Yoshi series isn't one that I've gotten too deep into outside of Yoshi's Story (I have Yoshi's Woolly World on the Wii U, but I haven't beaten it), but I'll look into other games some time and try them out.\n\nTears of the Kingdom: All lightroots and shrines.\n\nI already left my TotK review but recently went back to complete the afore mentioned objectives. Although there is still a large amount to do, this review focuses on a more completionist view of the game. I also upgraded a ton of armor, which will be covered. There are 152 shrines and 120 lightroots in the game. Getting them all does get repetitive, especially for the lightroots, but I have always said it's better to have too much to do than too little, as far as open world games are concerned. TotK is HUGE and that's a good thing. And the majority of the shrines are clever little physics or device puzzles. There is a lot of diversity. Although there definitely are more \"defeat the grunts without your equipment\" and \"find the crystal\" shrines than there need to be. Overall they're fairly easy but finding creative ways to cheese puzzles can make you feel big brained. One thing I found quite ingenious was that the ground level shrines are always right above a lightroot so you can find one and use it to locate the other. This is great when there are so many shrines hidden in caves that are easily missed. All this is on top of 6 regular dungeons and the final gauntlet, which are where the game really shines.\n\nThe weapon, armor and upgrade system falls a bit short though. Really short. Frankly the costs need to be seriously nerfed. You can make ultimate weapons with several diamonds and other materials but they just break so easily that it's not even worth it. If your Hylian shield breaks for example you can buy another one for 3000 freaking rupees! It's outrageous. Diamonds are so valuable in this game and upgrading armor costs a fortune in both money and materials. This leads to several pain in the ass issues for completionists. 1 rare materials are too rare. Lynal guts for example drop from about one out of three Lynals. I needed 9 to upgrade my full armor set and had to hunt over 30 Lynals. Even simple things like Lizalfos tails are hard to come by. 2 Unlike in Breath of the Wild, the dragons which give you key materials can't be spawn camped and once you get 1 material from them you can't get another for 10 real world minutes. This makes farming them a huge pain. 3 you have to jump through a long series of elaborate hoops just to access the faries who will upgrade your armor. 4 Armors take a lot of materials that are very easy to accidently use (or sell) without even realizing it. Everything from cooking ingrediants to weapon buffs. If you want to make the strongest weapons with the fuse system, too bad: you need to save those materials to upgrade armor sets! It's a flawed system that pumps the breaks on your fun.\n\nI might as well mention Koroks too. These little tree spirits appear when you complete a little puzzel and let you expand your inventory space. This was a really clever idea that gets you exploring every inch of the map. My only complaint is there are only so many puzzles and they get repetitive after a while. Frankly the korok that you have to bring to his friend was grossly overdone and you kind of hate seeing him because it means dropping what you were doing to do his quest.\n\nIn addition to all this there are a ton of mostly usless armor sets to collect.\n\nOverall TotK has a massive amount of content that could take you well over a hundred hours to complete. It's a great way to expand a great game although with some tweeking needed. Still this is far more conent than most games offer and helps justify the heafty $70 price tag. I continue to rate the game 9.5 out of 10: extrordanary but with just enough flaws to keep from getting a perfect score.\n\nDragon's Dogma (originally for PS3)\n\nThis game is like planting the bulb of an orchid then marketing it as a flower before it has even sprouted: it has the seeds of a great Dungeons and Dragons style open world game but sadly falls massively short in a plethora of key areas. You play as the Arizen in a medieval quest to slay a dragon. The main gimmick of this game is the pawn system. You have the ability to summon up to 3 other characters to fight for and serve you in your quest. While this sounds good in theory, it has a lot of poorly designed issues around it. I could write an entire page on how the menus, maps, combat, quests, etc all are poorly designed but I'll focus on what I found were the biggest issues. Starting at the top, the stamina system paired with the encumbrance system. You have very little stamina and are constantly over-encumbered, which makes stamina regen slow to a crawl. The idea is that you have 4 characters worth of inventory space. The issue with this is that you're the main one to pick up items so your character's inventory gets clogged incredibly fast. This means that you must manually open the menu and give items to your pawns to carry. The issue with this is you can't use a pawn's item. It's constant micromanaging of inventory. It's frequent that you switch 2 of your pawns out for new ones as they don't level up; if you do this without removing the items from their inventory, you lose them without warning. Pair this with the poor stamina system. You are forced to slowly walk everywhere because your stamina regens so slowly. You need stamina for special attacks and if you run up to enemies you won't have any. A simple solution to this would be to not consume stamina while not in battle but that's not the case. It's just a very poorly thought out system. Pair this with another issue: the enemy spam is ridiculous! You literally fight hundreds of enemies on any given journey from A to B. And did I mention the game doesn't even have a dodge button for its Dark Souls style combat? Given how much you're forced to back track due to a poorly implemented fast travel system, you spend an enormous amount of time walking slowly forward into huge packs of grunt enemies. To make matters worse, there's no \"flee\" command for your party. Your pawns will keep fighting when you try to run away and if one dies you must backtrack and resurrect them or lose them. See what I mean? It's a hot mess. In addition, the plot is poor and quests frequently are vague and sometimes broken. I had a crucial NPC simply not load and I ran around for an hour before looking it up online and reloading the area to finally get it to work.\n\nSorry for the big block of negativity but this game was fully of incredibly boneheaded decisions from the devs. I didn't even finish it. I will say, it has elements that are very fun. It's a shame they didn't play out better. 5/10 Don't recommend.\n\nIt's been a while since I've posted in this thread. lol\n\nFire Emblem Warriors (Switch)\n\nVery much a game that hinges on whether or not you bought the DLC. This was my first Warriors game, and I can safely say that it is definitely a junkfood game. A game that is good in short bursts, but hard to sit through for long play sessions. When you get combos and juggles going, it feels amazing, but the amount of repetitiveness and grinding required as you progress is really daunting.\n\nThe game without the DLC is pretty mediocre, but with it, it boosts the game's content by almost 200% and makes many missions much more enjoyable. I honestly can't imagine playing this game in it's vanilla state. The DLC characters offer playstyles and weapon skills that almost feel required to clear some missions. Ex. In the base game, there are only 3 Lance Users and they are all Pegasus Knights who play the same/have the same weaknesses. Or how missions only allow Bow Users (up to 4) but the base game only has 3 (1 of which is Anna, who I didn't unlock until over 100 hours into the game).\n\nI did pick up the 3DS version + DLC before the eShop closed and it seems to run fine, but there is zero-point in buying this version without it now.\n\nIt took me about 250 hours to 100% the game + DLC, so it's hard to deny I got my moneys worth. It's a shame that it didn't receive a Definitive Edition with the DLC on cart or any extra content. The character roster is pretty unbalanced in terms of gameplay styles and representation (I hope you like FE Fates), so adding in another Dragon Stone/Bow user or a fan favorite like Ike or Roy would have gone a long way.\n\nIf you do play the game, just make sure to initally bring Chrom/Niles/Ryoma into every mission so you can Support with them and unlock their skills on other characters. Also do not play the game with the Fire Emblem permadeath gimmick on; while it's hard to die, it will only add to the amount of grinding you have to do to revive the character and could potentially soft-lock your game if all of your characters of a weapon type die.\n\nHime's Quest (GBC)\n\nA Zelda clone. Not much to say other than it's a harmless licensed game. It's super easy and entirely linear, and probably not worth going for 100%, but there is definitely a lot of love put into it by the development team for what is otherwise a free web browser game on Crunchyroll's website.\n\nThe biggest nitpick is mostly that you never get to upgrade your sword, so it never really feels like you grow stronger on your journey. Every enemy in the game takes between 2-5 hits to kill, so combat feels fairly stale after the first dungeon. Enemies also drop health ups more often than coins (1 coin per enemy only), so bum rushing enemies/bosses is often easier than learning patterns or grinding money for more bombs/arrows.\n\nI'm glad that a physical version game out so when the web browser version shuts down, it'll still be around. The game is charming and the music is great. I can definitely seeing this being a perfect introduction to the Zelda formula for Kids. That said, if it does get a Steam/Switch digital release, I wouldn't pay more than $5~10 for it. I would be curious to see the same dev team tackle a more ambitious sequel as I think they have the talent for it.\n\nInfamous: Second Son\n\nI've been interested in this game for a while. If you've ever seen one of those social media posts of pics that \"go hard\" or whatever? That's the vibe this game gave to me as a kid. And in my sophomore year of high school, my friend was a fan of the game and he showed me all the playable abilities on YouTube. I finally caved and downloaded the game (free with one of the PS Plus tiers) when Penny Parker, one of my favorite streamers, mentioned it in relation to Prototype (a similar game by a different developer). I also had high expectations because Sucker Punch's other projects included Ghosts of Tsushima and the Sly Cooper games, which I've heard fantastic things about.\n\nThe game has a really fun opening - spray painting police billboards in your punk rock getup and doing parkour on the docks of your tribe's hometown. Then you accidentally get some guy's powers and inherit smoke abilities, which let you dash through most objects in an invulnerable ashy form. After a tough decision when the main villain arrests you, you cross the bridge to Seattle and the world is open. The goal? Augustine has encased your tribe's limbs in concrete with her own abilities, and it's up to you to inherit her own powers and use them to heal your family.\n\nThe draw of this game is unlocking new abilities that allow you to progress further, and upgrading those abilities to become stronger and faster. For instance, you can fire smoke projectiles, and if the conditions are met, you can upgrade your smoke projectiles to knock down enemies with just a headshot (usually takes 5-30 hits depending on the enemy type and weapon type). You can dash through the air with Smoke Dash, and upgrade it to dash twice in the air.\n\nThe movement in this game is really solid - Smoke Dashing through a vent to reach the top of a builiding instantaneously, then dashing forward and hovering onto a high-speed train to reach your next destination. I won't spoil them, but some of the later abilities get even crazier, especially with the proper upgrades. In order to upgrade your abilities, you'll have to find Shards, which can be taken from Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) tech. That means destroying toll booths, shooting down DUP drones, and blowing up DUP Mobile Command Centers, heavily protected vehicles you'll have to push through a small army to get to. But the upgrades are worth it, and by postgame, you're pretty much unstoppable.\n\nRemember that \"tough decision\" I mentioned earlier, before the world opens up? Well, that's a choice between confessing that yes, you inherited powers from an escaped superhuman convict, or staying silent and letting your entire tribe take the blow. These two choices don't change the events, but they will determine which morality you begin with, good or evil. This affects the kinds of upgrades to your abilities you can get (for example, having a faster fire rate with evil, or faster healing rate with good), what happens in the story, how Delsin acts in dialogue and cutscenes, and which side missions you'll want to be doing.\n\nThere is a LOT to do on the map, some of it busywork to get the 100%, like shooting down DUP cameras or taking down secret DUP agents hiding in the crowds, but there's also a lot you can do that isn't neccessary, yet will build up your good or evil karma (unlocking more abilities and giving you cooler jackets). An example of a good sidequest being busting a drug deal and nonlethally subduing the dealers, and a bad one being harming and/or killing a group of anti-superhuman protestors.\n\nHonestly, I did want to give this game a fair shake, and replay the whole thing on \"Infamous\" mode after my emotionally fulfilling \"Hero\" playthrough. But it was clear that this is the kind of game you play once, maybe twice, ever. It's just very slow, there's no way to skip cutscenes and there's no such thing as a New Game +, so I can't just blow through all the enemy encounters. And while it's a great game, a lot of it feels like doing similar chores over and over, chase missions and whatnot. And the combat could really use some more abilities - the same three-hit combos, light ammo and heavy ammo were not doing it for me. The most fun ability is the postgame one, which is extremely powerful and lets you decimate every encounter. When every enemy feels like a bullet sponge, the final power really helps the postgame stuff from feeling like a slog.\n\nThat's not even counting the boss fights. Goodness gracious, these are some bad ones. One of them has you destroy each and every neon sign in the room to deprive your opponent of their Neon ability, and THEN you have to wittle down their health bar as they teleport across the screen over two or three minutes. Another can only be defeated with heavy bullets, and you have to jump back and forth across platforms to recharge at - with precision platforming in this game so rare, it came as a shock. The final boss has some cool ideas, but really lost steam halfway through once the goal became \"dodge under its legs, wait for your heavy ammo to recharge\".\n\nWhat Infamous: Second Son lacked in combat, it made up for with its writing. Keep in mind, I played the Hero story, so some things may vary from other playthroughs, but at least in what I played, Delson is a young, strong-willed protagonist who loves his brother and his tribe, is learning new powers, and shoots quips with his enemies at an insanely fast rate. The childlike wonder in his voice when his mission involves climbing up the side of the Space Needle to beat up some bad guys is one of my favorite moments in the story. Nolan North does a great job, and on that note, the entire voice cast is astounding, especially Travis Willingham as Delson's brother, Reggie, who brings so much love and comedy to this game. The juxtaposition between Delson, a laid-back graffiti artist with a long list of arrests, and his brother, the police chief responsible for each one of those arrests, is obvious, but that divide between them makes it all the more heartwarming when Reggie comforts his brother, who is terrified of his brand-new abilities, in a hug. Or at the end of the game, when Delson avenges his brother's death at the hands of the antagonist, Augustine.\n\nThe conflict, yes, is between you and the main antagonist, Augustine, who leads the DUP and locks up superhumans like you. But the real tension lies in the public opinion of Delson and the other superhumans, and how the governemtn and the DUP influence that opinion. While the official term for supercharged humans in this game is \"Conduits\", the government has coined the term \"Bio-Terrorists\", believing Conduits to be too strong to keep on the streets, or alive at all. You're labeled a terrorist as soon as you recieve your powers, even though you've done nothing but save people. The questions this game asks about how our governments deal with threats and minorities are very real and well-stated. I especially love the graffiti art that Delson can put up around the city - depending on your morality, it can either be light-hearted and funny, or vulgar and violent - though either way you'll generally end up making some kind of statement about law enforcement and the abuse of power in government.\n\nThe graffiti sections are very fun - you turn your controller sideways, hold it like an Aerosol can, shake it, and press R2 to spray with motion controls over a stencil. Very much screams \"I am an early PS4 game and I will insert needless touch and motion controls into cutscenes and gameplay\". (Speaking of which, the way you refill your abilities is with tapping the touchpad at a chimney, neon sign, etc, but it feels natural so I didn't mind). The fact that you're putting your art on public property without permission does make the Hero path a little questionable, but all of your graffiti on that path will be good-natured or humorous and I love seeing the art, so I didn't think much of it. There must be at least 50 or 60 unique pieces betweeen the good and evil variants for each individual tagging location.\n\nFor me, the best part of this game was the addicitng gameplay loop of doing sidequests to get better powers and using those better powers to do more side misisons and so on. It's a really fun, addicting ten or so hours, maybe thirteen if you're doing 100%, and double that if you want the full experience of playing through both stories. I highly do NOT reccommend that last option though, because there's really not much to justify replaying. Although I will say, the final cutscene of the evil route is breathtaking.\n\nTo put my thoughts in summary, Infamous: Second Son is a really cool game, and if it had the combat of Insomniac Spdier-Man or Batman Arkham, I would give it a 10/10. It's still great, the combat is easy to overlook when so much cool stuff is happening, but when you've cleared up the main story it definitely slows down a bit. I reccommend it!\n\n8/10\n\nP.S. Do NOT do the Paper Trail mission. Apparently it used to be a cool ARG type thing, but the website for it went down, so now it's just a string of side missions that make zero sense.\n\nSpiderman 2 (PS5)\n\nThe direct sequel to Marvel's Spiderman. It's an open world beat em up type game but with a lot of side activities to break up the repetitive fighting.\n\nThe good:\n\nAlthough the story's about what you'd expect from a superhero game, the boss fights are epic and there's a lot of side stories that flesh out the characters. You really feel like they're actual people and not one dimensional heroes. The side activities are a big improvement in the fun factor from the first game. Although it can be a little hard to tell what to do at times they overall do a good job of guiding you through the various missions and games. You do a wide variety of things from stealth missions to flying for some reason. That brings up the web wings. Now you can glide around New York. This is a great fix for some problems with the first game, namely that web-slinging requires the AI to find a building and sometimes it doesn't and you faceplant into the ground. Now you can cross open areas like rivers better. New York is beautifully rendered and vibrant with life. You can zip around the city really fast and it's a joy to explore.\n\nThe bad:\n\nFirst of all this game has a serious case of early game suckage. Your characters, yes there are 2 Spidermen now, are pathetically weak at the start until you unlock several upgrades. Most of my deaths were early game. That's not helped by the fact this game has an incredibly steep learning curve and that's coming from a veteran of Spiderman one. To be fare they did a pretty good job of making you control complex, ultra-athletic characters but not perfect. There are many times when what you're trying to do simply doesn't work and it gets frustrating. This is compounded by the controls. There are far too many options. For combat you have attack, dodge, jump, heal, web-zip to enemies, parry, 4 special moves activated by holding the L button down and pressing a face button, web attack, 4 gadgets activated by holding the R button down and pressing the face buttons and L3+R3 for a super burst when your meter's full. All your gadgets and special moves take time to recharge, as do web attacks so you literally have 9 timers to keep track of. This is all when 2 dozen thugs are shooting guns at you and trying to kill you with various weapons. It's far too much to keep track of and the game would have been better with only special moves and no gadgets. To make matters worse, all your special moves and gadgets do essentially the same thing: disable groups of enemies. It doesn't really matter which ones you use and when. I ended up just rotating through the special moves and gadgets frantically as I attacked and dodged. This game is extremely mash heavy btw. Eventually you get the hang of it but a simplified combat system with more meaningful special moves would have greatly improved the game. Also the map is pretty small for an open world game and reused from Spiderman 1.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nSpiderman 2 can be epic and tons of fun if you're willing to work through the adjustment period and deal with some occasional frustrating moments. Playing as the Spidermen grants a lot of freedom and is more fun than other superhero games. Overall the gameplay could have been better thought out but is fun regardless.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and Phoenix Wright: Justice For All\n\nI have never reviewed a book before, let alone a visual novel! I guess I'm going to do this in a less conventional sense, then.\n\nCapcom is known for their crazy-ass bosses - from Monster Hunter to Mega Man to DMC to their vast fighting game collection - and I must say, Phoenix Wright may not have boss fights in a literal sense, but the courtroom chapters sure feel like them. The sound effects for the menu, the music, and especially \"Objection!\", these sounds do a great job at making you feel like what you're doing is a great big deal and a huge battle, even though it's technically just talking to people and yelling a lot. The witnesses and murderers all have such incredible animation, it felt like each antagonist topped the last in terms of animation and personality. I get the same feeling from pulling out evidence after evidence that I do from pulling off a long Tony Hawk combo or securing a three-stock in Smash. If there is one negative thing I have to say about the court cases, it's that the ways in which Mia helps the player out can fluctuate greatly between hand-holding and dropping you off a cliff. Sometimes I've figured out the mystery before it is promptly over-explained to me, other times I've had to look up a guide while squinting my eyelids to avoid spoilers. However, the investigations have this aspect much worse, to the point where I was stuck for a whole hour twice, both in Justice For All, because I was lost on where to go, and what to present to who. The ability to present characters to other characters slightly increased the length of the investigations, I must say.\n\nI really feel like not a single case went to waste. Virtually everything is tied up in a nice little bow at the end of each of the two games. My favorite case had to be Rise from the Ashes. For spoiler reasons I cannot discuss why, but it's just so so good. And it felt the least frustrating in terms of \"where do I go, who do I talk to\" out of all the cases I've played so far.\n\nI also think a great part of this series is the lovable characters. The humor mostly hits, although whenever Nick treated Maya like crap I had to groan. Even after she's been starved for two days he has the ****ing audacity to make fun of her for wanting to eat a lot of food?\n\nMy biggest complaint is just how much repetition there is when I can't figure out where to go or who to talk to. It breaks the immersion consistently, and makes me not want to play, although the plot always reels me back in for another hour or two until I eventually realize it's midnight.\n\nEdgeworth. Edgeworth edgeworth edgeworth. He is my GOAT. He is the literal best guy ever. If I had to pick my favorite of the two games, I gotta go with the first one cause I like him way more in that one.\n\nMy favorite characters (apart from Edgey-poo) are the Skye sisters, Von Karma, Damon Gant, and Ini Miney. The former two are just very sweet characters - Damon Gant is super intimidating and a fitting final antagonist for technically having supreme power over our two main characters. Von Karma was the only character who did the \"i'm the prosecutor so the judge follows my orders actually\" and it be consistently funny, it wasn't as funny when Franziska did it. And Ini Miney is just probably the most evil character in the series in my opinion, what she did was so visceral and unbelievable. It's chilling.\n\nAA 1: 8/10, same for AA 2 though I prefer the first."
