        "text": "Combat-Based Platformer\n\nA style of game that has platforming elements, but with more emphasis placed on fighting enemies than precise maneuvering through the level and its obstacles. Notable examples include Ratchet &amp; Clank and early Ninja Gaiden games.\n\nConveniently Obscured Nudity\n\nDue to crafty camera angles and conveniently placed objects in the environment, the nudity in the scene is obscured from view.\n\nEnd Credits Songs\n\nWhen a song is played over the end-credits, often by a famous artist.\n\nEnemy Roll Call\n\nAll the enemies in the game show up in the credits, sometimes before the people who made the game.\n\nExtra Life\n\nEarning an extra life, either by collecting a 1up or by hitting a certain score.\n\nHigh Score\n\nIn many games there is a ranking system, the players with the highest point value are listed in a \"high score\" table.\n\nJ-Pop\n\nJapanese pop music, also known as J-Pop, refers to the most popular and mainstream music produced in Japan. It is commonly featured in many rhythm games as well as other genres.\n\nMonsters That Look Suspiciously Like Genitalia\n\nPeople that make games are crazy, that's been evident since the 70s. Like a lot of crazy people they look at too much H.R Giger and realize that the human body is a truly disturbing thing.\n\nPower Up\n\nPower Ups can be used to give the controlling character, or any other character, temporary or permanent upgrades.\n\nSequel\n\nA sequel (also called a follow-up) is a game that carries forward the gameplay concepts, and often the story, of a previous game to which it is officially linked.\n\nSlideshow Cutscene\n\nThe limitations of early gaming hardware, especially in the 8-bit and 16-bit days, made animated story sequences impractical for many games. One popular alternative was to convey the story through a series of still images, often with text and music alongside them."
