After something of a wild turd hunt to track those files down, I did as you said and that has fixed the issue. I also set Turbo R as my console on start-up again, and it no longer crashes on start-up. So, those missing files must've been the culprit.\n\nThank you for this gift in development. I've really been enjoying exploring more software for this odd little Japanese computer. Even bought Dim X and cranked on the 3D feature.\n\nSo, another question I would have in light of this would be in regards to the BIOS files for the MSX/MSX2. Because I actually had those BIOS files already, as they were required for the original MSXDS emulator on the DS, and I dropped them all in the Root>3ds>fMSX3DS directory as opposed to the FMSX3DS folder in the root. Are they of any use at all in that directory, or is fMS3XDS indeed loading the MSX/MSX2 BIOS from Retroarch?\n\nAnd I guess in regards to the sound issues I'm having... apparently it is often a general issue with certain fan-translated-English ROMs themselves. Tinkering between certain settings -- such as forcing the SCC+ soundchip -- has varying results. Fixes certain things in one game, breaks certain things in others.\n\nPost automatically merged: Mar 24, 2024\n\nI think I remember there a way to improve the sound quality of scc games. Forgot how it goes, but ive done it. I have experienced the same issue with turbo R though\n\nWith the SCC+ soundcard, perhaps? Don't know of any other way you could possibly improve the sound apart from using a potentially superior soundcard that the individual game was programmed for.\n\nI've explored this issue a little more, and apparently a lot of English fan translations romhacks just have inherent sound issues, such as the Project Melancholia English translation of SD Snatcher. Apparently, the SCC & SCC+ sound cards just straight-up don't work for it on most emulators. I myself always get the PSG sound, even when the game detects the SCC+ card and I command it to use it. Apparently someone devised a fix for this issue in Retroarch using dummy soundcard files. I downloaded them and threw them in the appropriate folder directories in fMSX3DS as well as in the Retroarch directories, and it hasn't made any difference. However, *not* forcing the SCC+ soundcard in the fMSX3DS emulator options settings leaves the sound in SD Snatcher broken. Enabling it at least fixes the standard PSG sound. But then, alternatively, forcing the SCC+ soundcard breaks the sound in Metal Gear 2, and disabling the setting fixes the sound in that. So, there seems to be a lot of individual idiosyncrasies regarding various MSX ROMs in terms of sound.\n\nBut certain games are still missing certain sounds/sound channels and whatnot, no matter what I tweak in the settings. And just generally, I feel like the sound is really low and subdued on this thing, even when I got the 3DS volume cranked full-blast.\n\nThanks for this super cool and niche emulator! I wanted to report a major bug I encountered in MSX2 Dragon Quest 1 (specifically with Django's partial English translation applied):\n\nAfter speaking to the old wizard in the starting castle area who rapidly flashes the screen with light after speaking to him, the color palette of the entire screen became incredibly washed out, with not even resetting the console or saving in-game making it go away on that save. Only starting a new save got rid of it, but when I went back over to him, it happened again. I'm pretty sure that's an important NPC, too.\n\nI also had a couple questions and some feedback:\n\n-Why does the \"no scale\" option under the \"screen stretch\" option display the image in the corner of the screen instead of the center? Is there a way to center it?\n\nI also remember that another option, I think \"keep aspect\" when the separate \"screen filter\" option is disabled, made the image about 10 pixels horizontally off-center.\n\n-The navigation sensitivity in the emulator settings menu is very high, meaning you have to be actively careful and precarious during basic navigation for it to not fly all over the place. A similar thing happens with needing to very quickly jerk the stylus away from the touch screen to not accidentally select, say, the wrong MSX model mode to reset to when using that screen/the virtual keyboard on it to bring up a menu. I think the sensitivity should be adjusted to match digital UI standards where such issues don't exist, and the user doesn't have to exert such vigilance.\n\n-Whenever you exit and re-enter the emulator menu, it has no cursor memory and doesn't remember where in the menu you last were. Having to navigate through the entire menu from the top to get back to the function you want to use every single time quickly gets tedious, especially for the save state and screenshot menus all the way at the bottom.\n\nI think that cursor memory should be implemented, and pressing the B button/bound \"back\" inputs should just take you back one menu layer (with cursor memory for between layers, too) instead of backing you out of the menu entirely. The start button/touchscreen/etc should be what's relegated to an instant exit. All of this would further align with menu design standards."
