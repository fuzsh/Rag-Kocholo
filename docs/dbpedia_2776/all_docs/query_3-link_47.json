Of course we had to make sure that the new Duo is a perfect match for our releases and so we had a little test run with a bunch of our titles. And… Good news! Continue Reading\n\nBLACK FRIDAY SALE 2023\n\nAnd our Black Friday sale 2023 is now live!! Starting today (November 22nd) and running until Thursday next week (November 30th), we’re offering you great discounts on many titles from our back catalogue. And worldwide shipping is of course still included in all our prices. (this year’s sale has ended). Continue Reading\n\nCLEAVERS AND BROOMSTICKS V2\n\nFinally available! Took us only six years to bring you updated re-issues of our Splatterhouse and Magical Chase sets from 2017. For Splatterhouse we added a second HuCard with the brilliant romhack Splatterhouse Chrome and a great looking TG16 version of Magical Chase is now available as well.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nNow Shipping\n\n[updated May 8th] TG16 and (regular edition) PC Engine HuCards of Dinoforce are now in stock. If you pre-ordered one, you probably already got a shipping notification :) We have a few copies directly available on hand, so new orders are currently shipping within a few days. Check the rest of the posting for shipping updates on other pre-order items. Continue Reading\n\nDINOFORCE\n\nWe already teased it a little while ago and some of you might have guessed correctly already. We’re very happy to bring you DINOFORCE on HuCard for PC Engine and Turbografx-16 setups. HuCards are currently available in stock and the game’s ROM file can be downloaded free of charge as well! Enjoy! Continue Reading\n\nPC ENGINE 35TH ANNIVERSARY SALE\n\nToday the PC ENGINE is celebrating its 35th Anniversary. October 30th, 1987 was the launch of the original white PC ENGINE system in Japan. Of course we’re also celebrating with a BIG SALE starting today and running for a full month until Black Friday at the end of November. [NOW OVER]\n\nContinue Reading\n\nSuperGrafx Collection\n\nWhile the SuperGrafx wasn’t NEC’s most successful endeavor, the system is of course still an important part of the PC Engine family. With its graphical power it offered some of the finest titles of its time and with more and more compatible systems becoming available, it’s time to honor the system by collecting its most important titles into one gorgeous collection. Continue Reading\n\nPC-FX Essentials\n\nAnd now for something completely different! Well, almost…. If you’re an avid PC Engine collector, then there’s a good chance, you like NEC’s successor system, the PC-FX just as much. And this is why you might need our PC-FX Essential Collection.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nSHOOTING LEGENDS V\n\nTwo full years since our last entry to the series and we’re back one final time with the fifth and final chapter in our Shooting Legends series. Once more four incredible PC Engine shoot’em ups collected in one neat set. Continue Reading\n\nCYBER WEEK SALE 2021\n\nAnd our Black Friday sale 2021 is now live!! Starting today (November 25th) until Sunday next week (December 5th), we’re offering you nearly our complete back catalogue with some great discounts off the regular prices. And worldwide shipping is of course still included on all the prices. This year’s sale has ended. Continue Reading\n\nMEGA ENGINE LAUNCH\n\nWe just opened orders for the first batch of Mega Engine units. If you registered your interest earlier this year, then you already got an invitation email with a link to our Mega Engine order form.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nKeio Yugekitai MCD\n\nKeio Yugekitai is one of the two pack-in games for our Mega Engine machine, but is of course also available on its own. Keio Flying Squadron (as it was known in the west) beefs up its classic horizontal shoot’em up gameplay with a storyline told through FMV scenes and (unfortunately) a quite brutal difficulty curve – especially for players new to the genre.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nSailor Moon\n\nStarting in mid-July 2021 all orders will include a free copy of Bishôjo Senshi Sailor Moon (in English) on Super CD-Rom². It’s a Digital Comic (or what you would call a Visual Novel these days) from 1994 with a story-arc exclusive to the game. Continue Reading\n\nMEGA ENGINE\n\nOur last hurrah for 2020 is a first look at our upcoming PC Engine CD and Mega CD player called Mega Engine.

Starting today (11/25) and lasting till Saturday (December 5th), we’re happy to offer you between 25 and 40% discount on all our box sets released between 2014 and 2019. (our sale has now ended!) Continue Reading\n\nARCADE CARD GEMS\n\nNEC’s mid-90s Arcade Card upgrade to the PC Engine can certainly be considered a somehow ill-fated endeavour. Only a handful titles make good use of the whopping 20mbit of extra memory, while still remain worth playing to this date. Our new set compiles the four most interesting Arcade Card titles into one box.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nPCE & CG Mini HuCard Dummies\n\nEarlier this year we saw the release of the PC Engine Mini. While nothing for the serious PC Engine gamer, it makes a great collectible or a great gift for somebody you want to introduce to the PC Engine universe. Continue Reading\n\nDEAD OF THE BRAIN 1&2\n\nOriginally released almost 12 years after the PC Engine’s release, Dead of the Brain 1&2 marks the very last official commercial release for our favorite console. The game collects both installments of the Cyberpunk / Zombie adventure series into a single game. Continue Reading\n\nFMT LADIES\n\nStarting in mid-august all orders will include a free copy of Final Match Tennis Ladies on Super CD-Rom². FMT is not only considered one of the best tennis games of all time to this very date, but also (along with Bomberman) one of the best multi-player titles on the PC Engine. Continue Reading\n\nTransparent PCE Shells\n\nGreat PCE-related products deserve your attention! Martin at Retro Game Restore (located in Taiwan) has produced fantastic looking PC Engine replacement shells. Have a look! Continue Reading\n\nCORONA UPDATE\n\nCorona is still affecting postal services around the globe. There are still some service limitations or suspensions in place to several countries all around the world. Here you can find an overview of what’s still causing problems. We will continue to update this thread accordingly. Continue Reading\n\nHUCARD BASICS\n\nPart of why the PC Engine system had such a cult following in the 80s was certainly Hudson’s and NEC’s engineering marvel called HuCard. While the format itself wasn’t really new, HuCards allowed for a much larger rom size compared to earlier card-based game formats – easily rivaling much larger game cartridges of the same time and thus combining state of the art game sizes with one hell of a sexy format. Continue Reading\n\nCAMP CALIFORNIA\n\nAs a little gimmick for all fans of the American TurboGrafx-16 and Turbo Duo library out there, we just stocked Camp California. Certainly one of the typically underrated platformers available for the system and originally exclusive to the US. Continue Reading\n\nCYBER WEEK SALE\n\nWelcome to our Cyber Week Sale 2019 (and let’s celebrate 5 years PCEWorks while we’re at it). Instead of joining the craze on just a single day, we’ll offer you great discounts for a whole week! (our sale has now ended…) Continue Reading\n\nSHOOTING LEGENDS IV\n\nHere we are with the 4th instalment in our Shooting Legends series. Four more masterpieces to round up your shooting collection. Perfect for long winter evenings at home with your PC Engine. Continue Reading\n\nFORGOTTEN WORLDS\n\nTo accompany the 4th and final instalment in our Shooting Legends series, we got a single version of one of the greatest arcade conversions out there on the PC Engine. Continue Reading\n\nACTION AND ARCADE II\n\nOur first new set for 2019 and in almost a year. And yes, the PC Engine’s library does indeed offer interesting titles that are not exclusively shoot’em ups, so we’re happy to introduce the second volume in our Action and Arcade line-up. Continue Reading\n\nBonk’s Adventure\n\nStarting this spring all orders will include a free copy of Bonk’s Adventure. This is the first adventure of Bonk (PC Genjin in japanese), soon-to-be mascot of the PC Engine. One of the most iconic jump’n’runs to come to the PC Engine. Continue Reading\n\nAkumajo Dracula X 25th Anniversary\n\nToday (October 29th, 2018) marks the 25th Anniversary of Akumajo Dracula X – Chi no Rondo. To commemorate the anniversary of the iconic PC Engine entry of the Castlevania series, we have prepared a new 25th Anniversary edition of the title. Continue Reading\n\nDRACULA X BLU-RAY\n\nFor customers who already own a copy of Dracula X, but still want to get the Blu-Ray disc from the 25th Anniversary boxset, we have a couple of boxed Blu-Ray copies available. Continue Reading\n\nDARK LEFT\n\nStarting in late August 2018 all orders* will include a free copy of Dark Left (*limited to one per person). Dark Left was only (re-) discovered very recently. Continue Reading\n\nFANTASM SOLDIER\n\nAlthough VALIS wasn’t exclusive to the PCE by any means, the series just feels home on NEC’s 8-bit power house. This boxset compiles the four PCE entries to the series while adding the English versions of Valis II and III as well as the Japan-exclusive Visual Collection disc for a whopping 7 CDs in total. Continue Reading\n\nHUCARD SLEEVES\n\nWe just added HuCard sleeves to our catalogue. These are a perfect replacement for your missing or sticky HuCard (or TG-16) sleeves. Of course they also match Sega Master System (or SG1000) cards or any other similar sized cards.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nDEDEN NO DEN\n\nOur new freebie for orders during the first half of 2018: starting right now all orders* will include a free copy of Tengai Makyô Deden no Den (*limited to one per person).\n\nContinue Reading\n\nPC ENGINE 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE\n\nAt the end of this month our favorite video game console, the PC ENGINE will celebrate its 30th Anniversary. To commemorate this date, we’re having a BIG SALE running until October 29/30. (The sale is over.)\n\nSAVE YOUR DATA!\n\nPC Engine setups are notorious for one thing: losing their saved data. The internal save banks on the interface units and inside the Duo systems are using capacitors to hold their data over time. So even back in the days not using your system for a year or so meant whispering goodbye to your save games. Continue Reading\n\nCLEAVERS & BROOMSTICKS\n\nThis month’s double feature focuses on two of the most iconic PC ENGINE titles, SPLATTERHOUSE and MAGICAL CHASE. But instead of just aiming at the PCE renditions of these titles, we went beyond the scope of our regular presentations and created two neat little fan packages, that aren’t exclusively aimed at PCE users, but at fans of these two games in general.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nSUMMER CARNIVAL ’92\n\nAnd a new freebie for the upcoming summer: starting right away, all orders* will include a free copy of Alzadick: Summer Carnival ’92 (* limited to one per person). Continue Reading\n\nDRAC’X DELUXE RESTOCK\n\nOver the next month we’ll try to restock some of the out-of-stock items. First title back in stock is the Deluxe Edition of Akumajou Dracula X. If you signed up for an email notification, you should have gotten that email by now. EDIT: all gone.\n\n3rd Limited Ed. Coin\n\nStarting with this April’s ACTION AND ARCADE boxset, we got a new batch of limited edition coins available. This time featuring Bonk (known as PC Genjin in Japan). Continue Reading\n\nPUZZLE AND ACTION\n\nWhile shoot’em up fans had some good times with our last boxset, let’s not forget that the PC Engine had a tremendous line up of really great titles of all varieties available. With our PUZZLE AND ACTION set, we focus on four great and unique titles, that shouldn’t be missing from any collection.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nX’mas Double Feature\n\nWith the year coming to an end, we have two more PC Engine Memories boxsets for you to enjoy. SHOOTING LEGENDS containing Spriggan, Spriggan mark2, Steam Hearts and Nexzr (plus Nexzr Special) and MAHJONG DREAMS bringing you one of the rarest PCE titles in existence. Continue Reading\n\nFREE THRILLS!\n\nMore good news: included with all orders* over the next few months will be a copy of Dungeon Master: Theron’s Quest (* limited to one per person). Continue Reading\n\nQUINTESSENTIAL WORKS\n\nBefore we head off into an exciting winter with brandnew titles, here’s one more set for the new PC Engine fans out there.

Continue Reading\n\nGUNHED SPECIAL CONTEST\n\nIncluded in our new Caravan Battle Stage box is GUNHED SPECIAL and for the next five weeks you can submit your scores to win a prize! Continue Reading\n\nCARAVAN BATTLE STAGE\n\nAvailable now is the CARAVAN BATTLE STAGE boxset, which compiles our three previously released caravan titles (Cycho Rider, Force Gear and Twin Bee Returns) and adds the title that started the whole caravan affair on the PC Engine – the so called “Special Version” of GUNHED. Continue Reading\n\nTHE FINAL BATCH\n\nof the BEST OF JAPAN boxset is now available in stock. One last chance to get our first boxset. Contents are identical to the original release from 2014. Cosmetics of the boxset were slightly updated.\n\nFree Bombs!\n\nGood news: every order* over the next few months will include a free copy of Bomberman (* limited to one per person).\n\nNew Limited Ed.

It’s actually a very elegant description of what PC Engine collectors certainly represent. The closest English periphrasis would be something like “the vanguard of the analogue rebellion” or “les pionniers de la rébellion analogique” in French or “アナログ回帰への先駆者” in Japanese.\n\nPCEWorks shall be our contribution to this very movement. Stop playing digital downloads or games you can’t own. Enjoy physical releases, enjoy unboxing them, enjoy feeling them and enjoy playing them on real hardware!\n\nLimited Edition Coins\n\nEach of the Limited Edition “PC Engine Memories” boxsets will come with an exclusive gold coin (well, not actually gold, but really shiny anyway and amazingly collectable!).
