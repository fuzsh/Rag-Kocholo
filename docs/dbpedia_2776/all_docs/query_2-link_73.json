        "text": "Valis: The Fantasm Soldier for Nintendo Switch\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection comprises the first three titles in the beloved video game series, for the first time ever localized in English.\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier\n\nWhat would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World – because she thought he was cute?! You’d think she’d been duped – and you’d be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one – and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World – the one she warned, “Don’t go out with him, he’s the Dark…” But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.\n\nValis II\n\nFrom the ashes of your ravaged homeland, the legendary sword Valis calls out to you. Its power transforms you into a ferocious warrior against the evil forces of King Magus. Crush Zarooga, the fearsome red dragon! Battle the unspeakable Death Pod! But beware! Magus has sworn a blood oath to destroy you and capture Valis, to possess its power forevermore. Summon all your fury to face Magus in an epic struggle over the fate of your countrymen.\n\nValis III\n\nYou are Yuko Ahso, a student in the Human World, called to fulfill your destiny in the Dreamland. Your mission is to wield the Sword of Valis to defend Dreamland against attack from the Dark King Glames. Glames seeks more territory to replace his disappearing Dark Kingdom. His powerful Sword of Lethus is the magical counterpart to Yuko’s Sword of Valis. Whoever has the pair controls enormous destructive power. Yuko’s twin sister, Valna, is the new Queen of Dreamland. Yuko needs Valna and her powerful magic in the battle against Glames, but Valna is trapped in a crystal block. Only with the help of Cham and her fighting spirit can Yuko free her sister. Can Yuko depend on Cham who was born of the Dark Kingdom? Yuko must defeat the evil bosses Garther and Kolilanba before Cham and Valna can help. You must evade and destroy Glames and his subordinates. Yuko, Valna, and Cham can slide, high-jump, and use special attacks with fire, ice and thunder. Increase your power by picking up attack items as you go. But time is running out. The fate of Dreamland hangs in the balance!\n\nThere is also a Collector’s Edition that comes with:\n\nthe game (region free)\n\nalternate cover\n\n4-disc original soundtrack\n\nreversible 18″ x 24″ poster\n\n3 art cards\n\nPVC Valis sword keychain\n\n3 pin set\n\nAvailability / Price\n\nStandard: open-preorder / $39.99\n\nCollector’s: open pre-order / $89.99\n\nPre-order window\n\nopens: January 7th, 2022\n\ncloses: February 6th, 2022\n\nWant the game?
