        "text": "The efficiency between 30W and 120W is the most interesting here, I read a review of the Antec 650W, it seems to do best at 100W up to 400-500W. But really 250W is the starting mark for the 90% rating.\n\nyeah but the ea-450 is better at the lower numbers\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...ea-450&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\n\nthe curve shifts to left with lower watt psu\n\nhere is a review on a lesser watt antic\n\nhttp://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&op=Story&reid=35\n\nIt says \"Over 96% efficiency\" in the link. But you need to buy an additional power brick for it to convert AC-DC.\n\nHere's the kit that includes a 8.5A / 102W adapter: http://www.mini-box.com/picoPSU-150-XT-102-power-kithttp://www.mini-box.com/picoPSU-150-XT-102-power-kit\n\nBut you would probably want a bigger one given your peak watts. Here's 16A max. http://www.mini-box.com/12v-16A-AC-DC-Power-Adapter. It's >87% efficient\n\nhttp://www.mini-box.com/picoPSU-150-XT-102-power-kit\n\nit is a decent solution but looks like 162 watt is max op says he should stay in the 100 to 120 at max. It could work for him. I found an antec ea 380 watt link.\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...-pla-_-NA-_-NA\n\nthis should give 80 percent at the 75 watt and up it is 45 bucks the solution above is 87 percent and costs about 100 .\n\nif op pulls 50 watts average endlessly the 80 percent is 62.5 watts the 87 percent is 57.5 watts so 24/7/365 is 43.8 k watts a year at 20 cents per k watt he breaks even in about 6 years\n\nbut atech has a review on it\n\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/3902/antec-earthwatts-ea-380d-green-380w/6\n\nif the op has 115.0 volt power source .\n\nthis has a 79 percent at 38 watts and a 84 percent at 76 watts.\n\nAt 84% this would pull 59.5 watts for a constant 50 watt pull. the 87 % would pull 57.5 that is only 2 watts an hour or 17.5 k watts at the same 20 cents a k watt more then 13 years to break even."
