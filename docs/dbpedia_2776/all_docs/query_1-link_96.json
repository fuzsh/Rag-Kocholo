        "text": "The official Twitter account for the Valis series has announced the western release of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection. The three games originally released for the PC Engine will be available on Switch in 2022. It’ll be possible to get it digitally or in a Limited Run Games physical edition. This release celebrates the 35 years of the sidescroller action franchise, which also received multiple console versions.\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection includes the three first games in the series. The first one, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, was originally released in 1986 for PC-88, but the PC Engine remake is widely recognized as one of the best editions of the game. In it, the King of the Dark World threatens the human realm and the Dream World. Only a girl called Yuko can fight against his forces using the mythical Sword of Valis.\n\nIn Valis II a new tyrant called Megas wishes to erase any potential threat to his throne. He orders the destruction of Yuko’s hometown, but she survives the attack and it just becomes the fuel for her to fight against him. Valis III has yet another dark lord (Glames) rising up. However, Yuko won’t be alone to defend Earth and the Dream World from this new menace, counting with the help of the Dark World warrior Cham and the mage Valna.\n\nPre-orders for the physical edition of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection will be available in January 2022, but a release date for the collection is still pending. We’ll keep you updated as publisher Edia and Limited Run Games announce more details for this classic collection. Check out a Japanese trailer below:"
