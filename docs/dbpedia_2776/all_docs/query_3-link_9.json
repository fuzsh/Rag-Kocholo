        "text": "When we last left plucky high schooler Yuko, she’d been transported to the mystical world of Vecanti, gifted the mighty Valis sword (along with a set of kinky bikini armor), and used her fresh new gear to vanquish the evil tyrant Rogles before returning to Tokyo to resume her everyday life. Valis II unsurprisingly sees her doing pretty much that exact thing again, except that Rogles’ older brother, Megas, is the one causing a ruckus this time.\n\nOriginal it’s not, though that was never really the point of the series to begin with. Valis titles were meant to show off scantily-clad anime girls to the greatest extent the technology of the time allowed. On the TurboGrafx-16 (and its Japanese counterpart, the PC Engine) that meant leveraging the console’s CD-ROM functionality to cram as many voiced cutscenes as possible in between the decidedly rote side-view action stages. Assuming you can make your peace with that, the games proper tend to make for breezy lightweight diversions. They’re nothing you haven’t seen done before, and better, but you can conversely do worse.\n\nWhile very much cast from this mold, 1989’s Valis II also holds the dubious distinction of being the weakest of the four Valis entries produced for the hardware. The nominal first outing, Mugen Senshi Valis, is a 1992 remake with significantly upgraded control, mechanics, and visuals. Parts III and IV and generally more full-featured due to their multiple playable characters. That leaves the comparatively basic and dowdy II as the odd one out.\n\nYuko’s goal is to jump and slash her way through five extremely long levels before moving on to a sixth and final one that takes the form of a relatively brief auto-scroller. The sheer length of the stages is arguably Valis II’s Achilles’ heel. By the halfway point of each, I was well and truly tired of swatting at the same handful of enemies in front of the same mediocre backgrounds. Compounding this is the overall lack of dynamic platforming scenarios or interesting environmental hazards. It’s a no-frills “walk forward and hammer that attack button” sort of game. Bosses are nothing to thrill over, either, unless you count the chuckles their amateurish pre-fight voice acting frequently elicits. You can outlast most by simply staying put and firing away until they explode.\n\nThe designers put in a token attempt to add some variety via the inclusion of four different projectile shot pickups for the Valis sword and a handful of limited-use magic abilities like a rotating shield and a time freeze. Again, however, these are hardly revelatory by genre standards. In a crowning irony, the saga’s trademark element, its cutscenes, are actually displayed smaller and in lower detail here than in later installments, too. That leaves the soundtrack to stand as the sole unqualified high point. Smooth ’80s synth and drum machine ditties that wouldn’t have been out of place in any given anime of the era? Sign me up for that!\n\nWhen all is said and done, Valis II is a work profoundly of its time. Its presentation alone made it a standout during that brief interval when the TurboGrafx/PC Engine was poised at the cutting edge of the industry, effectively the first and only CD-ROM gaming platform. That hype sold units and made a lasting impression on the public at large. Even kids like me, who only knew of it from magazine screenshots and their accompanying effusive text blurbs. Can I recommend is as an isolated action-platforming experience all these years later? Nah. But I instead prefer to view it as a one-of-a-kind digital time capsule, worth a quick playthrough purely to glimpse how the future looked back at the dawn of the 1990s.\n\nEdo no Kiba (“Fang of Edo”) is a 1993 sci-fi action game by Riot, the same internal development team that produced Psycho Dream for publisher Telenet Japan the year previous. The title’s callback to Japanese capital Tokyo’s pre-modern moniker Edo is significant, as it reflects the game’s samurai cyberpunk art direction. Despite playing as a cop in high-tech powered armor battling robot terrorists in the year 2050, you still fight with a sword and many of your opponents resemble the Terminator by way of Akira Kurosawa. This style was seemingly all the rage at the time, as also evidenced by Compile’s Musha and CAProduction’s Hagane. Unlike those two, however, Edo no Kiba never scored a release outside Japan.\n\nIf you caught my review of Psycho Dream a few months back, much of what I said there applies to Edo no Kiba as well. That is, it’s another bare bones, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it effort that barely qualifies as mediocre. Heck, the most interesting thing about it is probably how difficult it is to cleanly slot into a genre. It’s an auto-scroller, but not a shooter. It handles somewhat like a beat-’em-up in the ground movement department, yet it doesn’t have any of the combos, throws, or other signature moves this naturally primes you to expect. It’s not an action-platformer, as there’s no platforming. In the end, I suppose it’s a game where the screen scrolls on its own and you hit stuff. Call that what you will.\n\nYour character’s abilities are nothing to write home about. Jumping and the basic sword slash are self-explanatory. Holding down the attack button raises the sword in a guard position and allows it to block some shot types, although there seems to be no way of telling which other than trial and error. The real trick is to master throwing the sword by pressing forward while in guard stance. It will then travel the full length of the screen before boomeranging back, dealing heavy damage to bosses and potentially taking out multiple regular enemies in a row. If you find yourself in trouble, you have a super bomb attack that can be triggered once per life. Not that I never found myself needing it. The action simply isn’t that hectic. Opponents are few and far-between across the six extremely brief stages.\n\nEmpty as it can feel at times, Edo no Kiba somehow manages to run quite poorly. Slowdown and flicker are as prominent here as they are in legitimately fast-paced and chaotic SNES contemporaries such as Contra III and U.N. Squadron. Coupled with the stiff controls, the result would be downright frustrating if it wasn’t for the instant in-place respawns and extremely generous continue system. You start with five lives and nine continues on the default difficulty setting. I bumped the difficulty up a level on my first playthrough, granting me just five continues instead, and still had no trouble clearing it.\n\nEdo no Kiba isn’t all bad by any means. It’s easy to pick up and play, a few of the giant mecha bosses are well drawn and fun to square off against, and the driving, hard-edged soundtrack showcases some beefy percussion. For me, though, there’s no escaping the fact that the game as a whole feels half-baked, as if it was rushed or even unfinished. The conspicuous lack of enemies in the back half could well indicate the latter. Psycho Dream, unexceptional as it was, at least delivered more than this via its inclusion of two playable characters. Why would you want to play this when Hagane handles the same concept and aesthetic exponentially better? Beats me. Oh, wait! I got it! Edo no Kiba is the only game I know of that shouts its title at you whenever you pause. Really. A cheesy voice sample blurts out “Edo no Kiba!” each and every time. It’s hilarious. That’s gotta count for something…right?\n\nRiot’s Psycho Dream is an example of a Super Nintendo game that almost was. Judging by magazine coverage and the existence of preliminary box art, it was apparently just on the verge of being released here in North America under the name Dream Probe in late 1993, but publisher Telenet Japan never went through with it. Why, I’m not exactly sure. Perhaps it came down to Psycho Dream’s extremely short length or its bizarre subject matter. Or, and this is the theory I happen to favor, they took a hard look at its tepid critical reception in Japan and realized that it simply wasn’t up to snuff.\n\nPsycho Dream posits a near future where fully immersive virtual reality movies have emerged as a new form of entertainment. Some viewers have become addicted, opting to retreat ever deeper into a technologically-induced dream state as their physical bodies waste away. One such poor soul, a girl named Yūki Sayaka, has become lost in a digital work entitled “Story of the Ruined Capital.” A pair of expert troubleshooters, Ryō Shijima and Maria Tobari, are brought in to infiltrate the program and retrieve Yūki from the perilous depths of the simulation before it’s too late. If nothing else, I’ll give Riot kudos for taking on this “dream diving” concept years before such films as Paprika and Inception. I do wish they could have included proper in-game cut scenes to bring their backstory to life, though. This was the one thing Telenet projects were most known for, as evidenced by their popular Valis series.\n\nYour first order of business is to choose whether you want to play as Ryō or Maria. There is, unfortunately, no two-player mode. The duo have practically identical melee attacks and movement capabilities with one major exception: If you can survive long enough to fully upgrade your character’s main weapon by collecting the hilariously yonic power-ups dropped by defeated foes, you’ll eventually come across a red one that will transform him or her into a superpowered ultimate form. Ryō’s is a cyborg that fires a spread of ricocheting lasers in six directions, while Maria’s is a scantily-clad fairy that shoots homing orbs and can glide through the air. The overwhelming utility of the orbs alone makes Maria the stronger hero. This transformation lasts until three hits are sustained, whereupon the character reverts all the way back to the very first weapon power level and the cycle begins anew. You also have have a limited stock of full-screen super attacks if things get too hectic. These would be a lot more useful if enemy placement wasn’t fairly sparse as a rule.\n\nBelieve it or not, that’s really all Psycho Dream offers in terms of game mechanics. Apart from that, it’s the most basic action-platformer imaginable. Button mash your way to the stage boss and whack it until it explodes. Do that six times and you’ve won. A complete playthrough clocks it at around a half hour and the relatively slight variation between Ryō and Maria may not be sufficient to make upping your total time investment to a full hour feel worthwhile.\n\nIt would certainly help Psycho Dream’s case if these particular six stages were exceptional in any way. Well, no dice. This level design is uninspired at its best and utterly insipid the remainder of the time. Take the second area, which consists entirely of a small room with a few holes in the ceiling that periodically disgorge minor baddies. Kill enough of them and the holes begin to disappear one by one. Once you finally clear them all . . . the room resets and you get do it over again. Then you fight the boss and that’s level two done and dusted. Ugh.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the visual design largely fails to do the game’s promising sci-fi setup justice. The scenery and inhabitants of Yūki’s computerized nightmare really aren’t all that memorable. It’s tough to get excited about traversing a subway, a forest, or a blue cave, only to then do battle with bosses like a big bug, another big bug, and a big jellyfish. You know the ball was dropped when Kabuki Quantum Fighter on the humble 8-bit NES presented a more compelling virtual reality hellscape. So much creative potential squandered. The lone bright spot is the deliciously off-kilter musical score by Michiko Naruke of Wild Arms fame. Jittery, creepy, and borderline discordant at times, it’s experimental in the best of ways; the ghost of a truly trippy game that should have been.\n\nAs much as I’d prefer to be extolling the virtues of yet another gem of a Japanese exclusive this week, Psycho Dream is barely passable, even by the middle-of-the-road standard set by other contemporary Telenet/Riot releases. It is at least a quick and easy playthrough, so you might still consider devoting an hour or so to soaking in its fascinating soundtrack. Beyond that, however, I guarantee nobody’s going to need to risk their life tearing you away from this one.\n\nBy this point, I think I have a pretty good grasp of what a typical early ’90s CD-ROM game from Telenet Japan is: A short, bare bones playthrough bolstered by some sweet music and lavish (for the time) cinematic cut scenes. Last Alert, Mugen Senshi Valis, and my subject this week, Exile, are all cut from this same cloth. These are true style-over-substance exercises centered on showcasing the flashier possibilities of the new storage medium above all else. Not objectionably so, thankfully, as the gameplay that is present is always broadly competent. Still, top billing rightfully goes to the soundtrack and cut scenes. It turns out that Exile also has its very own ace in the hole, though, courtesy of its English localization by Working Designs.\n\nExile’s plot is a wild one. Our hero, Sadler, is an Assassin, and I don’t just mean in the informal sense of a dude who murders people. He’s a member of the Nizari Ismailis, the original Shiite Muslim sect that inspired the term via a corrupted form of the Arabic hasisi (“hashish-eater”), this moniker being based on the group’s supposed ritual drug use. The historical Assassins thrived in the 11th through 13th centuries, right around the same time the Crusades were in full swing. With these Christian invaders rampaging through his homeland, Sadler and his rotating cast of NPC buddies set off in search of a way to put an end to the strife. Along the way, they get wrapped with Templar knights, druids, and even a bit of time travel, among other things. And yes, that makes this a video game with Assassins, Templars, and a time travel gimmick well over a decade before Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed franchise kicked off. Coincidence? Beats me.\n\nActual play is divided up into two main modes. One is a simplified Dragon Quest style overhead view in which Sadler and company stroll around chatting up the locals for clues on where to go next and browsing shops. Entering specific buildings triggers the transition to the side-view action-platforming mode where all combat takes place. Here, Sadler can jump, duck, slash with his sword, and activate a small number of magic spells. Magic is quite limited, comprising only fire and ice projectiles plus a healing spell. It’s all rather basic, but it gets the job done. As this is technically an RPG, slashing up baddies will eventually result in permanent health and magic gauge increases. I recommend you do this right away, in fact, since taking a few minutes to grind out five or six extra levels on the rapidly respawning bugs in the first area will result in much smoother progress throughout.\n\nThat’s about all you need to know to play Exile. It’s hardly what I’d call a deep experience. You’re rarely able to pick between more than two or three locations to visit at any given time, making exploration almost nonexistent. Nor is there puzzle solving per se. If you need a certain item for your quest, you’ll eventually come across it in the natural course of play with no real thought required. It reminds me of Gargoyle’s Quest on the Game Boy in that all its RPG trappings are ultimately window dressing. That leaves the action-platforming as the main event and it’s serviceable at best. It lacks a noteworthy twist or gimmick to set it apart from any other game where some guy swings a sword at monsters.\n\nEnter Working Designs. As mentioned in a few of my previous reviews, this now-defunct publisher was both loved and hated by the gaming public for its irreverent approach to English localization. Their work on Exile was further complicated by a firm directive from platformer holder NEC, who wanted the English version scrubbed of its potentially controversial real world religious themes. These two factors combine to make the TurboGrafx-16 release of Exile one weird, wacky trip. The religious whitewashing is hilariously paper-thin. Christians are now, get this, Clispins. As if we still couldn’t figure out who these maniacs with bright red crosses on their outfits rampaging through the Middle East are supposed to be. It’s even funnier when the hammy amateur voice actors are forced to say it aloud. Clispins . . . Lord have mercy. On top of that, the trademark Working Designs playfulness clashes garishly with some of the more serious situations. In what I’m sure was meant to be a harrowing moment, a heretic burning at the stake quips about how much he hates mesquite. If that wasn’t silly enough, Sadler’s reply to him made me drop the controller, I was laughing so hard. The contrast between the original intent and the script we were given is so bizarre that I can’t help loving it.\n\nOn the whole, I can recommend Exile. It’s not brilliant or essential or anything like that, just a no-frills action RPG with quality music and some semi-accidental laugh-out-loud moments. It commits no egregious design sins and is thus a decent enough way to pass three hours or so. Telenet Japan delivers again, provided you keep your expectations nice and modest.\n\nTelenet’s Valis series of action-platformers was an unknown quantity to me growing up. I read about its entries on the Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, and Super Nintendo in magazines, so I knew it had something to do with a high school girl in a skimpy outfit battling monsters with a magic sword. Said publications were especially keen to hype the presentation of the TurboGrafx releases, which harnessed then-cutting edge CD-ROM technology to deliver lush soundtracks and loads of fully voiced anime style cut scenes. Until this week, though, I’d never actually sat down and acquainted myself with the swashbuckling escapades of magical girl Yuko.\n\nNaturally, I wanted to begin with the first game, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier. The original 1986 versions were for various Japanese home computers, however, so I sought out one of the later console ports. Of those, the consensus seems to be that the 1992 PC-Engine CD-ROM remake, Mugen Senshi Valis: The Legend of a Fantasm Soldier, is far and away the best. Looking at the contenders side-by-side, it’s easy to tell why. The PCE edition is miles above the rest graphically, and those CD bells and whistles have their intended effect of punching up a stock “everyday kid is whisked away to a fantasy realm and declared the Chosen One” plot. Don’t worry if you don’t understand Japanese, by the way. It’s the sort of narrative one can follow regardless.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about Mugen Senshi Valis was that it isn’t nearly as gratuitously sleazy as I was expecting. Yuko’s bod was always front and center in the franchise’s marketing, but the exploitation factor here is limited to her metal bikini “armor” and the odd obligatory panty shot. Beyond that, there are no awkward sexual situations interrupting her seven stage mission to run to the right and cut down the minions of the dark lord Rogles. Pretty tame in a post-Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball world. Fans of full-on hentai had to wait until 2006’s Valis X for their naughty tentacle fix. No, I won’t be covering that one.\n\nAs for the gameplay, this is an overall competent side-scrolling hack-and-slasher. Yuko has no shortage of options for dealing with the bloodthirsty beasts plaguing the Dream World of Vecanti. Her standard jump is complimented by a nifty Mega Man-esque ground slide that doubles as an attack. The Valis Sword’s default swing can be supplemented by five different projectile types, each of which can be further upgraded by collecting that same power-up icon multiple times in a row. Dying will remove one level of weapon power, so use caution. Last, and certainly not least, are Yuko’s six spells. These are obtained one at a time by defeating bosses and cost variable amounts of magic points to activate. The most useful for me were Earthquake, which damages all non-flying enemies on-screen, and Tornado, which envelops Yuko in a protective force field that effectively acts as extra health.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s the generally weak level design of Mugen Senshi Valis that holds it back from greatness. The areas Yuko battles through are universally small and simplistic. They look gorgeous and don’t lack for enemy variety, yet I can’t escape the impression that all Yuko’s cool powers feel like overkill when her quest is so short. For example, I barely felt the need to employ spells at all before the finale in Rogles’ castle. These mediocre blink-and-you’ll-miss-’em stages stand out all the more given how much effort clearly went into the pixel art, music, and cut scene production. They’re never sloppy or outright terrible, mind you. They just come across as the bare minimum necessary to ship the product. Factor in unlimited continues and the average player will be able to experience everything the game has to offer within a couple hours.\n\nAll that said, don’t mistake the above criticism or the brevity of this review with contempt on my part. Squandered potential aside, I enjoyed Mugen Senshi Valis for the slick, high energy style-over-substance exercise it is. In retrospect, it’s really nothing special and there’s no mystery why the Valis brand fell off the radar once CD-ROM drives started going mainstream. Still, if you’re in the mood to revisit a simpler time when the novelty of high-pitched schoolgirl melodrama on your humble home gaming rig felt like science fiction come to life, I can think of far less agreeable ways to do so.\n\nI’ve long had a fondness for the sort of pick-up-and-play fantasy action first popularized by Atari’s 1985 arcade smash Gauntlet. There’s just something exhilarating about choosing a hero from a stable of familiar sword & sorcery archetypes, then blasting though hoards of monsters and grabbing as much treasure as possible, all with a friend (or three!) at your side. The two Dungeon Explorer titles on the TurboGrafx-16 did this formula proud, so I thought I’d move over to the Genesis and see what the Sega camp had to work with around the same time.\n\nArcus Odyssey comes to us from Wolf Team, one of the now defunct Telenet Japan’s three internal game development divisions. Telenet’s output in general was known for being mostly decent, if a bit rough around the edges. That definitely holds true for Arcus Odyssey, which is rather ugly by 1991 Genesis standards. Apart from a slick cinematic opening depicting the evil sorceress Castomira being defeated and sealed away by her good rival, the visuals here are almost uniformly drab.\n\nFortunately, looks aren’t everything. Peer past those muddy graphics and the one or two-player quest to save the land of Arcus from a revived Castomira is pretty entertaining. It begins, of course, by having you select one of the four playable characters on offer. They vary in terms of attack range, weapon damage, starting health, and the like. Each also has his or her own selection of magic spells. I went with Diane the elf archer, and she turned out to be a great beginner’s pick. Her arrows don’t start out particularly strong, but her ready access to healing magic gives her unparalleled staying power.\n\nThe eight stages of Arcus Odyssey play out from an isometric overhead perspective. You’re able to move and fire in eight directions, and thus a good deal of the strategy involves determining ideal angles of attack against specific foes. In addition to firing your main weapon and using the occasional spell or item, you have the ability to summon a shield that can block most enemy projectiles. The catch being that you can’t move or shoot while defending this way.\n\nNone of the areas you’ll visit are especially complex, with the odd exception of the third, which is inexplicably larger and more difficult than any of the rest. Instead of only requiring you to perform simple tasks to open the way to the main boss, such as talking to an NPC or defeating one or more mid-bosses, level three is a maze-like pyramid containing five locked doors and their accompanying keys. I actually thought Arcus Odyssey would turn out to be quite the challenging playthrough when I reached this point, only to see things calm back down immediately after and stay that way right through to the very end. Strange.\n\nOne thing to be aware of up front is that despite being commonly described as an action-adventure or even an action RPG, Arcus Odyssey is a pure linear hack-and-slash affair at heart. Your sole means of boosting your character’s stats are the gems dropped by certain defeated bosses. These will grant a permanent increase to either maximum health or weapon power, depending on whether the gem is shining blue or red when you collect it. This mechanic appears to have been swiped directly from Dungeon Explorer, although I can’t say I really mind. It works!\n\nFinally, I have to highligh the quality soundtrack here. It represents early work by the incredibly prolific and revered Motoi Sakuraba, so you know it’s worth a listen. In conjunction with the overall solid gameplay and co-op functionality, it makes Arcus Odyssey an easy recommendation for fans of this style of game. The abrupt difficulty spike in the third stage is an odd hiccup to be sure, but the unlimited continues and password system mean that it can absolutely be overcome with a little persistence. A Super Famicom port, Arcus Spirits, was released in 1993. However, that version is effectively the same adventure set to downgraded music. In other words, stick with the original. Your ears will thank you.\n\nMilitary-themed run-and-gun shooters were a mainstay of ’80s gaming. No arcade or home console library was complete without these grim depictions of lone wolf super soldiers machine gunning their way through legions of faceless goons. Primarily inspired by the international phenomenon that was the Rambo film franchise, a few of them even starred the man himself, though most publishers opted for stand-in ptotagonists over shelling out those big Stallone bucks.\n\nEnter Shin-Nihon Laser Soft, a short-lived subsidiary of Telenet Japan that brought Red Alert to the PC Engine in 1989. Red Alert’s claim to fame was its use of the system’s then cutting edge CD-ROM peripheral to add anime style cutscenes and voice acting to the familiar overhead run-and-gun formula. But a funny thing happened on the way to Red Alert’s North American debut as Last Alert the following year. Literally. The Japanese version’s generally respectable voice work was replaced with an amateur English dub so out-and-out ludicrous that it’s likely the only reason Last Alert is remembered at all these days. I’m reminded of how the Mega Drive port of Zero Wing’s “all your base are belong to us” opening scene has long since eclipsed any discussion of its merits as a game.\n\nIronically, this goofy dub is about the best thing that could have happened to Last Alert. Getting to hear our chisled one man army protagonist Guy Kazama spout lines like “Garcia, nobody can hire my feelings!” with all the grace and gravitas of a high school drama dork hopped up on Mountain Dew is vastly more entertaining than the action on offer. Not to say that the gameplay here is horrible. Last Alert is certainly playable and doesn’t suffer from any especially egregious design missteps. At same time, however, I can’t escape the feeling that those CD bells and whistles were the main point all along.\n\nI can describe Guy Kazama’s campaign against the sinister Force Project and their world-threatening superweapon Indra in two words: Long and mediocre. I’m talking no less than 23 stages of the most resolutely average small arms combat ever programmed. Guy can move and attack in the expected eight directions. One button fires his unlimited ammo gun and the other deploys grenades, homing missiles, and other limited use backup weapons. Most stages require Guy to simply reach and defeat a boss at the end. A handful include miscellaneous objectives, such as rescuing hostages or planting bombs, that must be accomplished for the boss to appear. The bulk of the opposition is made up of bog standard grunts who’ll either stand in place and take the occasional potshot at Guy or slowly jog after him while doing the same. Yes, it all works and yes, it grows quite tiresome by the halfway mark. At least it’s also remarkably easy, so you won’t have to waste any more of your time on memorization or practice.\n\nThe only standout mechanic for me is the experience system. Hitting certain score thresholds will gradually level Guy up from his starting rank of Ranger all the way up to a rank nineteen Super Hero. Every level adds another box to Guy’s health meter and a new, more powerful gun is added to his inventory every four levels or so. It’s a solid idea in the context of a lengthier take on the genre and I got more enjoyment out of seeing what my next rank title and weapon upgrade would be than I did out of the actual gunfights.\n\nVisually, the sparse backgrounds and underdetailed sprites are barely a step up from those seen in Capcom’s Commando four years prior. That’s an eternity in ’80s game development terms. We can’t blame the hardware for this, either. Data East’s Bloody Wolf made it to the PC Engine a few months before Last Alert (on a regular low-capacity HuCard, I might add) and still managed to look significantly nicer. The soundtrack fares a bit better, although it never approaches the dizzying heights of a Lords of Thunder or Ys Book I & II.\n\nLast Alert isn’t much to look at and is entirely too basic and repetitive to sustain player interest over the minimum ninety minutes or so it takes to complete a playthrough. As far as old school commando bloodbaths on the TurboGrafx-16 go, the aforementioned Bloody Wolf is the superior game. On the other hand, my fellow lovers of all things camp will treasure every misbegotten syllable of Last Alert’s dialog. If you’re the type to sit through an incompetent movie just for the “so bad, it’s good” factor, you’ll be right at home blasting away as Guy Kazama.\n\nLike many here in North America, the widely available Super Nintendo release of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys served as my introduction to the series back in the ’90s. I played it with a friend and mainly just remember how much we cracked up at the area where a neverending stream of pissed-off birds keeps pouring out of the sky and all you need to do to rapidly level up protagonist Adol is make him stand there with his sword held up as this avalanche of angry avians kamikaze into it ad infinitum. Magnificent. For decades, that’s all Nihon Falcom’s venerable saga was to me: A forgettable SNES action RPG with the easiest, and funniest, level grinding ever. Having recently rediscovered Ys via the remarkable Book I & II for TurboGrafx-CD, I thought it might be fun to renew my acquaintance with Wanderers.\n\nAh, but why limit myself to one platform this time around? Originally released for Japanese home computers in 1989, Ys III became one of the few games to appear on all three major 16-bit consoles in 1991. I couldn’t decide which version to play, so I didn’t! Instead, I’m pulling out all the stops to bring you my first triple review! That’s right: I played through the Genesis, Super Nintendo, and TurboGrafx-CD editions of Ys III back-to-back. So you don’t have to, I guess. How do they compare? Which is the best overall? Read on!\n\nFirst, I should probably break down how Ys III works and weigh in on whether any iteration of it is actually worth playing. It has a reputation among hardcore fans as a black sheep entry. So much so that many consider it to be completely superseded by its own official 2005 remake, Ys: The Oath in Felghana. Why? Some point to its status as the lone side-scroller in the franchise. The same could be said of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, though, and I adore it. No, above all, Ys III is simply too basic for its own good.\n\nWanderers from Ys begins with the title characters, red-haired swordsman Adol and his faithful companion Dogi, stopping in for a friendly visit to Dogi’s home town. They soon discover that the region’s power hungry ruler is hatching a plot to revive an ancient demon of tremendous power and it falls on Adol to sort everything out. He’ll accomplish this by charging down a fixed sequence of corridors, furiously dicing up everything in his path.\n\nYs III pares the action RPG down to its barest essentials. The player is afforded no freedom when it comes to where to go or what to do next. There’s one town, two shops, and a handful of dungeons that feature plenty of enemies, but zero exploration or puzzle solving. If it wasn’t for the experience system and periodic dialog scenes, you could easily mistake this for a typical pure action-platformer of the period. Such is its strict linearity and unwavering focus on hack-and-slash.\n\nFor all that, Ys III might have still been a-ok if the combat was top-notch. Unfortunately, it suffers from a general lack of feedback that leaves it feeling floaty and disjointed. Adol and his foes don’t tend to react to each other’s attacks, so you never get the impression that the characters on-screen are truly interacting. This tactile element is so fundamental to the success of any action game that we only tend to notice it in its absence. That absence makes the game tougher than it otherwise would be, too, as enemies that manage to touch Adol are prone to linger there, doling out constant damage. Be sure to rack up tons of experience early on, and make liberal use of your ability to save progress nearly anywhere.\n\nThe sole standout aspect of Ys III is the spectacular soundtrack by Mieko Ishikawa, who was somehow able to maintain the epic energy of the first two games without the aid of former co-composer Yuzo Koshiro. Apart from that, we’re left with a woefully shallow action RPG that’s unlikely to impress fans of either genre, let alone both. While not legitimately terrible, it’s well below the usual Ys standard. It is at least short, however, and I suppose there are countless worse ways to spend two or three hours of your life.\n\nNow, on to the comparisons!\n\nGenesis\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent music that closely resembles that of the computer originals.\n\nWell balanced combat, neither punishingly difficult nor a complete pushover.\n\nCons:\n\nBy far the worst translation job. Character and place names have been altered, syntax is consistently awkward, and misspellings abound. You know I giggled when the shopkeeper asked if I wanted to “buy harb.”\n\nSuper Nintendo\n\nPros:\n\nBest in-game graphics thanks to larger, more detailed sprites.\n\nMost accurate translation. Character and place names maintain continuity with other installments and the dialog reads reasonably natural.\n\nFastest experience grind due to the exploitable instant enemy respawns unique to this version. Think those crazy birds I mentioned.\n\nCons:\n\nWorst music. Questionable sample choices mar some brilliant compositions, leaving them sounding weak and a little cheesy at times.\n\nExtra-durable enemies that constantly respawn disrupt the balance of combat. This is the most difficult playthrough of the three for all the wrong reasons.\n\nTurboGrafx-CD\n\nPros:\n\nUtterly spectacular CD soundtrack that begs to be heard.\n\nLovely opening and closing cutscenes.\n\nCons:\n\nThe choppy background scrolling might literally give you a headache if you stare at it too long. I can’t overemphasize what an almighty eyesore this jittering mess is throughout.\n\nThere’s voice acting for the majority of the main cast. Wretched, low effort voice acting that isn’t even goofy enough to be amusing. They shouldn’t have bothered.\n\nArguably too easy.\n\nWinner: Genesis. It can’t quite match the Super Nintendo’s visuals or the TurboGrafx’s stunning CD music, and its script really would have benefited from some additional proofreading. Despite that, it suffers from the fewest major issues and is ultimately the most balanced, best playing option. If you seek out only one 16-bit port of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, make it Sega’s."
