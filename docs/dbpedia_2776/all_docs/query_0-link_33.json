        "text": "01/22/16»I decided to try to fix whatever is broken on these pages, and if I have time add new content...\n\nI have many years of catch-up to do, although the Valis series is no longer.. a few things popped up here and there...\n\nI will feature them, including the porno valis game. Yes, porno.\n\nFor now :\n\nI recovered what I could on the media section and added Valis 2, Valis 3, and Valis 4. Full ISO's with Audio, available for anyone to download! New 2011 mix by Juan Daniel to be uploaded soon, as will new content be added to the media section!\n\nValis for Vodafone - 2005 - (Japan only)\n\nBandai networks corporation and Talnet Japan released a new Valis game for the \"Vodafone live!\" (a mobile phone in Japan) 525 ¥ to download for unlimited play! I wish I could play get my hands on this Valis title, or at least try it out. But, since it's only available for cell phones in Japan. I don't think that's going to happen any time soon. It's claimed to feature great graphics with scaling, rotation, sprite distortion, transparencies and nice animation. It's even got those great anime sequences featuring those girls... :) Game play is similar to Valis 2 (you run around killing baddies with your Valis sword and pick up power ups, sounds like good times!) Apparently there is a shop where you can buy sexy nurse costumes. (drool).\n\nOut: 05.18.05\n\nSize: 1.8 meg\n\nType: 256K appli (V6 series vodaphone)\n\nWhat is Valis? ¬\n\nValis, The Legend of a Fantasm Soldier, is one of the coolest \"old school\" video game series ever; Anime style art, Girls with swords in battle armor, and cool music. What else could one want? Anyway, I got a lots of fun stuff here; Game Reviews, Roms, Pictures etc. If your a Vails fan, or just becoming one, I think you will enjoy these pages.\n\nSome background on Valis ¬\n\n\"Valis\" is hard to define, the easiest way to describe it is a sword with a mind. In case you have not figured it out yet, Valis the name of a video game. Full title: Valis Legend of a Fantasm Soldier this is only the title of the first game, as many others fallowed. The first Valis games came out on 8-bit machines like the MSX computer & Nintendo Famicom. Later released for 16-bit systems; PC Engine/Turbo Grafx, Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, and Super Famicom/Super Nintendo.\n\nValis is great 2D side scrolling platformer.. eg. Castlevaina, MegaMan etc. The game includes kick ass anime sequences, anime style graphics, and nice music (especially CD versions). I myself put my head down in shame when one plays a cart version when they could be playing the PCE CD/DUO version of it insted. But, thats the way it goes I guess.\n\nThere were rumors of a actual Valis Anime OVA out there somewhere. Unfortunately, I have been told by a number of people, that they have looked through anime release lists in Japan and have never seen it listed. So I guess those rumors where not true. I was told that there might be a few mangas out there somewhere... Interestingly enough, a guy once told me that there was all kinds of Valis related Art/Mangas in old Japanese MSX mag, but I never got any scans of those so who knows about that. It's not likely I will ever run across that magazine."
