        "text": "Even without technical advancements in the emulation side, especially with unoptimized rewind tools and English subtitles, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection II still is a great gift from Edia to the fans of this incredible series. I still feel Valis IV should have been included in the first collection and the absence of Mega Drive's version of Valis III bothered me a little but, overall, as a retro games fan, I can say it in no uncertain tone that the nostalgia hits the mark.\n\nReview in Portuguese | Read full review\n\nValis: The Ghost Soldier Collection II includes four games from the Valis franchise that complement the first compilation released a while ago. We have Valis IV in its PC-Engine CD Rom² version, Valis: The Fantasm Soldier in its Mega Drive/Genesis version, Syd of Valis for Mega Drive/Genesis and an extra is Valis: The Fantasm Soldier in its MSX version, the first title of the franchise from 1986, although a couple more versions are still missing. Despite this, recovering this franchise has been very worthwhile, and with this second compilation we complete the adventures of Valis that will give us good times of fun.\n\nReview in Spanish | Read full review"
