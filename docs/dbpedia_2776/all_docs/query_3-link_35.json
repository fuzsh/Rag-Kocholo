        "text": "After over a decade in the hands of private collectors, a new Sega CD game is about to make its debut. Burning Fists: Force Striker is currently being finished up by Good Deal Games and is slated for release at next month’s CiniClassic! To whet your appetite, Sega-16 has a full preview, including some info straight from GDG itself and even a beta video! Miss it not!\n\nDuring the ’90s Virgin Games was one of the premier Genesis 3rd party companies, racking up hits like Aladdin, Global Gladiators, and Cool Spot. One of the men responsible for its success was Dr. Stephen Clarke-Willson, Virgin’s former V.P. of Worldwide Product Development. From working with David Perry to the purchase of Westwood Studios, he was a key player in the company’s massive success.\n\nIt’s been ported to just about every platform on Earth, but it’s always just as grand. Delphine Software’s Flashback: The Quest for Identity set a new standard in just how much could fit into a cartridge, and it showed us that a great story, wrapped around excellent gameplay, was the true way to create a classic.\n\nIn perhaps the saddest twist for a gaming franchise, Telenet Japan has once and for all proven that nothing is sacred. A new game in the Valis series was released this past Monday, but there’s an evil twist that is sure to enfuriate fans everywhere. Sit down, take a deep breath, and prepare for your childhood to die a litttle more as you read our feature Valis: Downfall of a Franchise.\n\nRemember when the Genesis launched and there were so many cool games to play? Yes, that September and the following months were chock full of great releases, and among them was Mystic Defender, a spiritual sequel, of sorts, to the Master System’s SpellCaster. It had great graphics and gameplay, and plenty of weird enemies to dispatch."
