But indeed, how can we combine it with the English translation?\n\nI tried to patch the translation on the FRS-patched game, but that seems to undo some of the turbofixing, as the intro demo goes way to fast. @sd_snatcher what do you think?\n\nThe current version of the English translation patch contains a lot of the original files and restores them on different locations of the disk when applied. It will have to be recompiled for the disks with my enhancement patch v3 already applied.\n\nI asked Manuel Pazos (the main programmer of the English patch) some time ago, and he mentioned that he would try to recompile it after my release. I don't know if he's having enough time right for this right now though.\n\nsdsnatcher73 wrote:\n\nWonâ€™t the ultimate final version also fix?\n\nFrom the README:\n\nQuote:\n\nQ: Why so many versions for an enhancement patch? Can't it be done all at once?\n\nA: Consider this a work in progress. This is a huge game, and it's not possible\n\nfor a single person that has a RealLife(TM) to all the enhancements and\n\nfixes at once.\n\nAlso some aspects, like the drumkit, required to be done in incremental\n\nsteps, since it's very hard to tweak it the way you want given the\n\nconstraints of the replayer, and also it's done via reverse engineering, so\n\non each increment, more about the replayer was learned.\n\nBut do not wait for more improvements so soon, as I need to take a\n\nbreak from this game for a while.\n\nThe README also has some more juicy backstage info."
