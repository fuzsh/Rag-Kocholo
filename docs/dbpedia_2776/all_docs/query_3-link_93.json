The Australian version does exist. Clay Fighter US/EU dumped, Australia undumped Columns Sega Game Toshokan version Undumped, but probably same from retail All Game Toshokan ROMs have the same base code from the Game Toshokan cartridge itself, however Columns also received a retail release in Japan.

FIFA International Soccer US/EU dumped; Japan undumped Flicky US/EU dumped, Japan undumped The Japanese release of Flicky was a Game Toshokan exclusive, but every other Game Toshokan game (including Fatal Labyrinth) was dumped, so wtf... The Flintstones (Ocean) Undumped Sega Channel release, so the final is likely lost. drx is known to have a prototype. Fun 'n' Games EU/US dumped, Australia undumped Galaxy Force II \"Rev B\" and some unidentified revision dumped, \"Rev 0\" and \"Rev A\" undumped Revision names from no-intro's undumped list.

Jim Power: The Arcade Game Bad dump Exact issue unknown. This is a prototype of an unreleased game, so a good dump is very unlikely. J. League Pro Striker 2 Sample Undumped Junker's High Bad dump Exact issue unknown. This is a prototype of OutRun 2019, but a good dump may still be very unlikely. Lemmings US/EU/JP dumped, Korea undumped Mega Bomberman US/EU dumped, Korea undumped Mega Games 10/Sega Top Ten/10 Super Jogos Only 10 Super Jogos dumped Mick & Mack as the Global Gladiators US/EU dumped, Brazil undumped MLBPA Baseball US dumped, Australia undumped Mortal Kombat 3 US/EU dumped, Brazil undumped Nagoya Home Banking Undumped Bulls versus Blazers and the NBA Playoffs Japan Dumped — but see description The list indicates that there is a mismatch between the checksums in collector Xacrow's dump and in Cowering's GoodGen set.

NHLPA Hockey Undumped A version of NHLPA Hockey '93 specifically programmed for compatibility with the HeartBeat Catalyst.

Sonic 3D Blast US/EU dumped, Korea undumped The Story of Thor Japan prototype Bad dump Exact issue unknown. This is a prototype, so a good dump is very unlikely.

Reportedly complete and ready for manufacturing, likely has NES and SNES cartridge counterparts (reportedly with working cross-platform multiplayer), and may also be compatible with the Edge 16.[1] TinHead Both versions should be dumped just to be sure the Ballistic logo isn't in one of them as the present dump says Spectrum HoloByte Tintin in Tibet Should be redumped from all versions ROM sets presently use the French name, however the game was distributed using localized names, so this would only serve as verification. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron US/EU dumped, Korea undumped no-intro has a JP ROM, but there was no JP release — misnomer? Tom and Jerry: Frantic Antics US dumped, Japan and Korea undumped Triple Score: 3 Games in 1/Mega Games I Europe (Mega Games I) dumped, US (Triple Score: 3 Games in 1) undumped Valis III Japan ????? — see description The no-intro ROM name was changed after the list was made to \"Valis III (Japan) (Rev A).md.\" However, the list says they have 1.1, and are missing 1.0.
