        "text": "The third installment in the highly acclaimed ‘Valis: The Fantasm Soldier’ reissue series has arrived. This edition finally includes the popular titles ‘Valis: The Fantasm Soldier (PC-88 version)’ and ‘VALIS: The Fantasm Soldier (Family Computer version),’ which had particularly high demand for a reissue. Furthermore, the collection boasts a substantial volume with a total of five titles, adding ‘Valis: The Fantasm Soldier II (MSX2),’ ‘VALIS III (MEGA DRIVE),’ and ‘SUPER VALIS IV.’ This is the ultimate culmination of the Valis revival, a must-have for Valis and retro game fans.\n\nThe ‘Valis: The Fantasm Soldier’ series is a side-scrolling action game released as a PC game in 1986. The unique world where a high school girl in a sailor uniform and bikini armor battles demons, along with its solid action and story, captured the hearts of many game fans. This led to the production of numerous sequels and ports to other platforms. Even now, over 35 years since its inception, it remains a title supported by fans both in Japan and abroad.\n\nIn addition to the appreciation mode that allows you to fully enjoy the BGM and visual scenes, synonymous with the Valis series, there are additional features that let you thoroughly enjoy the charm of Valis. These include indispensable save and load functions for game strategy, and a ‘rewind’ feature that lets you go back and try again if you make a mistake."
