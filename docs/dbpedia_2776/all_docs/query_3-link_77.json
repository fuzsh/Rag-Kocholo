        "text": "In this week's Z-Club livestream, Zuiki gave a long-awaited update on some of the software coming to the X68000 Z — its miniature version of Sharp's X68000 16-bit home computer.\n\nIn case you're unaware, the X68000 Z does include a built-in emulator that allows you to load up and play your pre-existing games on the machine, but will also be home to a bunch of retro reissues that have been specifically designed to run on the X68000 Z.\n\nLast month, for instance, saw the release of The Exact Perfect Collection (across Beep, Amazon Japan, and other storefronts), while Game Collection Vol. 1 — a 5-game compilation — came pre-packaged with the main console unit on an SD card. As Ashley Day noted in our review, despite coming on an SD Card, only a single title included in the Game Collection Vol. 1 was actually available to play upon first getting the console, with the others instead being listed as \"coming soon\". That number has since grown to two, with Arcus Odyssey joining the two different versions of Mad Stalker made available last year.\n\nHere's a list of the software Zuiki announced dates for:\n\nGranada May 2024\n\nFZ Senki Axis May 2024\n\nGame Launcher for Midi-Compatible Games June 2024\n\nLagoon Summer 2024\n\nGenocide Summer 2024\n\nMurder Club DX (Game Collection Vol. 1) Summer 2024\n\nKiss of Murder Autumn 2024\n\nManhattan Requiem Autumn 2024\n\nNostalgia 1907 (Game Collection Vol. 1) Autumn 2024\n\nSol Feace Winter Winter 2024\n\nValis II Winter 2024\n\nShooting68K Z-Edition Winter 2024\n\nAnd here is a list of software that is yet to get a release date:\n\nRobot Construction R.C.\n\nKeeper\n\nGradius II\n\nSalamander\n\nTwin Bee\n\nDetana!! TwinBee\n\nCastlevania\n\nQuarth\n\nTōdō Ryūnosuke Tantei Nikki: Ōgon no Rashinban (The Golden Compass)\n\nKohakuiro no Yuigon: Seiyou Karuta Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (The Amber Colored Testament)\n\nRally Bike (Game Collection Vol. 1)\n\nWe'll try and keep you posted as more updates become available."
