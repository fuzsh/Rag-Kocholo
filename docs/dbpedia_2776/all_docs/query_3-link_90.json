Those of you who are especially knowledgeable about the featured console are encouraged to contribute any information that you think would be beneficial in the comments section. If you are new to the featured console and still have questions, you can also use the comments section and I will do my best to help you out.\n\nThis guide was originally published back in 2007, but it has been expanded and brought up to the standards of our newer guides! Lots of information on the Japanese version of the system has been included, since the TurboGrafx-16 experience benefits greatly from multi-region gaming.\n\nAlso see: Games That Defined The Turbo-Grafx 16\n\nBackground Information\n\nHudson Soft, the company responsible for the creation of the PC Engine (what the TurboGrafx-16 was called in Japan), was founded in 1973, and started out selling, and then later developing for, early computers. The founders were big fans of Hudson-style locomotives and named their company and some of their CPU designs after them.\n\nHudson Soft was the first 3rd party game developer for Nintendoâ€™s Famicom (NES) and over the life of the console they were quite prolific, programming and publishing a number of best-selling titles. Their first Famicom title was a version of their computer game Nuts & Milk. Hudson continued to publish titles on Nintendo systems even as their own PC Engine console was competing directly with the Famicom, and later, the Super Famicom (Super NES).\n\nHudson dabbled in hardware development, a factor which lead to the creation of the PC Engine. Once they had worked out the core chips that would power their new console system, they partnered with electronics giant NEC to manufacture the hardware. In Japan, NEC and Hudson both visibly backed the system, both with development and marketing. In the US, Hudson stayed out of the spotlight and NEC took full responsibility for the system.\n\nHistorical Impact\n\nFirst of the 16-bit Era: Hudson designed the PC Engine as a successor to Nintendo’s Famicom. The system uses a custom 8-bit CPU developed from the same CPU family as the Famicom, though much faster and more capable, and with improved audio capabilities. The CPU is paired with a 16-bit graphics chip. Despite the CPU’s 8-bit design, it is just as fast as the CPUs in the Super NES and the Sega Genesis when performing game-relevant operations. Because the PC Engine was the first system of a new generation, it lacks some of the special hardware capabilities of its later competitors, but due to solid design principles and the PC Engine CD ROMÂ² it was able to remain competitive.\n\nFirst CD ROM Console: The PC Engine CD ROMÂ² add-on was the debut of CD ROM discs as a game medium in the home console market. Sega eventually released a CD ROM expansion for the Mega Drive in 1991, several years after the PC Engine CD ROMÂ² had already demonstrated the viability of the technology. Famously, Nintendo partnered with Sony to release a Super Famicom CD ROM drive, only to see that partnership collapse. Sony’s work with Nintendo laid the groundwork for Sony’s own Playstation console.\n\nBuilt-In Turbo Button: All TurboGrafx-16 controllers and all but the first generation of PC Engine pads featured turbo functions for buttons I and II. The basic pad, one of the most comfortable pads made to date, has 2 simple toggles with off, slow, and fast. The TurboStick, a joystick resembling a lighter-weight, rounded-edged, black NES Advantage, featured two sliders for variable turbo and buttons to turn turbo on and off.\n\nFirst Controller Multitap: The PC Engine Multitap was released in 1987 and was the first peripheral of its kind. It allowed up to 5 controllers to be attached to the PC Engine.\n\nFirst Fully-Powered Portable: The Turbo Express, released originally in Japan as the PC Engine GT, was a hand-held version of the TurboGrafx-16. It was not the first portable system on the market. It was, however, the first portable system designed to run the exact same games as the home console.\n\nStrengths\n\nFirst to Market: In Japan, being first to market for the 16-bit generation meant a sales advantage. The Sega Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) never caught up, and it took Nintendo’s own Super Famicom, the true market successor to the Famicom, to knock the PC Engine into 2nd place. The success and longevity of the PC Engine in the Japanese market is analogous to the Sega Genesis’s success in the US market.\n\nCD ROM Technology (Japan): The PC Engine CD ROMÂ² allows the PC Engine to do a lot of things that were only seen on PC games at the time, like full-screen stills and cinemas. It also brought Red Book audio to console gaming, which meant excellent soundtracks and voice acting.\n\n2D Shooter Library: In both Japan and the US, the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 was the console to own for fans of shooters. It wouldnâ€™t be until the Sega Saturn was released that players had so many impressive shooter options to test their mettle.\n\nUpgradeable CD Add-On: The Super System Card (release in Japan and the US) and the Arcade Card (released only in Japan) provide more memory to the CD ROMÂ² base unit so that more data can be loaded from CD at once. This means levels can be longer, feature more varied graphics and improved animation, and have more sound effects. The practical effect of these upgrades was that the quality of CD ROM titles improved greatly over the years. Though the Arcade Card was released late in the system’s life, it allowed the PC Engine to host the best 16-bit ports of a number of Neo Geo fighting games.\n\nHudson Soft: Though many other developers created great games for the PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16, Hudson was the most prolific developer, and that wasn’t a bad thing. Hudson’s games were usually excellent.\n\nBalanced Design: Though the PC Engine lacks some advanced features like hardware scaling and rotation and a second background layer, the hardware is robust and well-balanced. It has good sprite handling capabilities, excellent color display abilities, an audio chip with flexibility and good digital sample playback, and a CPU that is capable of coordinating the system’s various functions with power to spare. See the Technical Specifications section for more detail.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nFirst to Market: Being first to market meant giving competitors a technology target. The TurboGrafx-16 has often been criticized for lacking hardware support for a second background layer, and for including the audio functions in the CPU instead of giving them their own dedicated silicon. What was an advantage in Japan was a disadvantage in the US.\n\nCD ROM Migration: Due to the high price of the TurboGrafx-CD in the US, and the fact that CDs hadn’t yet pushed cassettes out of the music market, the expansion was a tough sell for US customers. As CD releases started to supplant cartridge titles in Japan, the US market became a little starved for options. The lack of CD ROM penetration meant CD titles were slower in coming, and the decline of cart-based development on the system made it difficult to sustain the more affordable base unit.\n\nHigh Hardware Prices (US): The TurboGrafx-16 was initially expensive in the US, and the TurboGrafx-CD attachment and Turbo Express were even more so. The TurboGrafx-CD expansion debuted at $399, which was rather pricey for a peripheral. When the Turbo Duo was finally released it cost $299, which was quite reasonable for all the system could do and for the pack-ins included with it. Unfortunately, the TurboGrafx-16’s market share had fallen far enough that it was difficult to convince US consumers to give $300 to the last-place contender instead of Sega or Nintendo.\n\nVirtually Required Add-ons (US): The TurboGrafx-16 had a large number of peripherals, and, depending on the way you preferred to play, they were often required purchases. The system shipped with 1 controller port and only RF out, and not one TurboChip game had a save battery in it. You had to buy a TurboTap to play with even 2 players and if you wanted stereo AV out you had to pony up for, at the very least, a TurboBooster. Some of the best TurboChip games needed save capabilities to avoid dealing with messy passwords, but the cheapest save memory option was the $40 TurboBooster Plus. Later revisions of the PC Engine system added AV capabilities, but the TurboGrafx-16 system was never revised. Thankfully, the TurboGrafx-CD included AV out and CD and HuCard compatible save memory in addition to allowing you to play CD ROMÂ² games.\n\nPunished By Nintendoâ€™s Third Party Rule: Nintendo punished publishers who released titles for competing consoles. This meant early releases were dominated by Hudson and Namco titles, as both companies were too large and too integral to Nintendo’s success to punish. While some original developers flourished on the PC Engine, many companies that made their success on the Famicom and NES either never developed for the PC Engine or came over too late to help the US market regain ground. By the time Nintendo was rebuffed in court it was too late for the TurboGrafx-16 in the US. NEC was often criticized for odd decisions about which games to bring to the US, but Nintendo’s anti-competitive practices undoubtedly clouded this issue.\n\nNEC America: NEC America mishandled the nation-wide American debut of the TurboGrafx-16. Marketing was weak outside of large metro areas and the original pack-in, Keith Courage in Alpha Zones, was not the most appropriate pack-in title for the US market.\n\nLack of 3rd Party US Publishers: NEC’s struggles in the US market made other companies reluctant to release titles in the US. NEC America usually dominated release schedules. Working Designs was one of the only licensees to localize more than a couple games in the US, picking up some strong titles NEC America and, later, Turbo Technologies passed over.\n\nFew RPGs: Japanese gamers didn’t lack for role-playing titles, but not many RPGs were brought to the US, so American RPG lovers were left out in the cold.\n\nChanging Hands Late in the Game: NEC America handed control of the TurboGrafx-16 over to Turbo Technologies, Inc. (TTI) in 1991. By this point the US market was slipping dangerously. TTI managed to keep games coming until late 1993, and they remained on the market for a while afterwards selling what stock remained, but they never managed to turn things around. Eventually remaining inventory was passed to TurboZone Direct, a small company that persisted for a few years before running out of steam.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nCPU: HuC6280, custom 8-bit CPU based on the 65C02 running at 7.16 mhz.\n\nGPU: HuC6270, handles sprites, background tiles, and all other display effects.\n\nMemory: 8 KiB work RAM, 64 KiB VRAM. With PC Engine CD ROMÂ², an additional 64 KiB, 256 KiB, or 2304 KiB work RAM, depending on the system card used, and 64 KiB ADPCM RAM.\n\nSprite Capabilities: Up to 256 sprite pixels per line and up to 64 sprites on-screen at once. Available sprite sizes are 16×16, 16×32, 16×64, 32×16, 32×32, 32×64. Sprites of any available size can be mixed on-screen, unlike some other systems which limited developers to only two sprite sizes at a time.\n\nColor Capabilities: System palette of 512 colors. Up to 16 sprite and 16 tile palettes can be used simultaneously. Each palette has 16 colors available, though one color must be shared across all palettes of the same type as transparent. Maximum on-screen colors is approximately 480 (video mode trickery can be used to display more).\n\nResolution: Variable, though for practical intents and purposes, the standard resolutions were 256×239, 336×239, 512×224\n\nAudio capabilities: 6-channel PSG stereo audio driven by the CPU. Each channel can generate a programmable waveform or play back low quality digital samples. Two channels can be paired for medium quality digital sample playback (8-bit to 10-bit). Channels 1 & 2 can be paired for LFO (low-frequency oscillation) and channels 5 & 6 can produce white noise. The PC Engine CD ROMÂ² unit is able to play back CD-quality Red Book audio and also added a single ADPCM channel for medium quality digital audio playback. A CD title can therefore provide a total of 8 audio channels of different types, or, thanks to a Red Book audio soundtrack, take less of a hit from pairing PSG channels to take advantage of the more advanced audio features available.\n\nConsole Hardware Variations and Upgrades (US)\n\nTurboGrafx-16\n\nFor its US release, the TurboGrafx-16 was doubled in size over its Japanese counterpart, possibly following the theory that Americans think bigger is better, and aided and abetted by some extra RF shielding required by the FCC. The TurboGrafx-16 features RF out only and a single controller port that uses a much larger controller connector than the Japanese PC-Engine. It also has an enormous expansion port that juts from the back of the unit and shipped with a plastic cover that attached over this and made the shape of the system more uniform. The expansion port is identical to the PC Engineâ€™s expansion port and the TurboGrafx-16 can use all Japanese add-ons, and vice versa, assuming the add-ons can fit to the shape of the case. Despite the console’s size, the black case design was pretty impressive-looking.\n\nShop for TurboGrafx-16 System on eBay TurboGrafx-CD\n\nThis monstrous peripheral attaches to the expansion port and features a platform on which the TurboGrafx-16 rests. It is effectively the Japanese CD ROMÂ² add-on with a different shape and name. It allows the TurboGrafx-16 to play CD games and features 64 KiB of RAM into which to load game data and an ADPCM chip that provides an extra digital audio channel. It changed the face of gaming by allowing games to feature Red Book audio for spoken dialogue and soundtracks. It also increases the amount of game data that can be stored, meaning that a game can feature lots of cinema intermissions, both still and animated. The only drawback to this is that the limited data cache means lots of loading times between level sections or intermissions.The TurboGrafx-CD containes a removable CD drive slightly larger than early portable CD players. The AC adapter that came with the CD attachment powers both the TurboGrafx-CD and the TurboGrafx-16. The AC adapter that normally powers the TurboGrafx-16 can then be used to power the removable CD unit when detached and allow it to serve as a semi-portable CD player. It shipped with the CD ROMÂ² System 2.0 card. The TurboGrafx-CD features AV stereo output and save memory for CD and TurboChip games.\n\nShop for TurboGrafx-CD System on eBay Turbo Express\n\nThe Turbo Express is a handheld version of the TurboGrafx-16. Unlike the Gameboy or the Game Gear it accepts the same cart-based games as the console system and displays them on a small, high-quality LCD screen. Like many early LCD screens it suffers from “ghosting” due to a slow refresh rate, but the screen is one of the better quality ones available at the time. Being a full member of the Turbo family, it includes turbo switches, to this day a unique feature in a handheld.The Turbo Express features the ability to link to another unit for two-player action on select games, and it also features a TV tuner add-on. Due to the quality of the screen, it was almost as good as dedicated portable TV models and wasn’t much larger. The Turbo Express’s primary flaws were the price and the rather short battery life, flaws that were not easily remedied given the technology of the time. Not until the Sega Nomad would anybody again attempt to put a full-powered console into a portable case. Notably, the Nomad, too, was a market failure.\n\nShop for Turbo Express System on eBay Turbo Duo\n\nThe Turbo Duo was the last hurrah in the US. Designed in Japan and barely modified for the US, this system combines the TurboGrafx-16, CD ROMÂ² drive, Super System 3.0 BIOS, and Super CD expanded memory (see the Japan section) into a single, sleek, compact console. It still has only one controller port, but uses the smaller Japanese controller connection. It debuted in the US at $299 and featured an impressive set of pack-in games. The system came with an Ys I & II CD, Ninja Spirit on TurboChip, and a Super CD with Gates of Thunder, Bonkâ€™s Adventure, Bonkâ€™s Revenge, and a hidden copy of Bomberman that was unlockable with a code. There were some packages that featured a different TurboChip game.\n\nShop for Turbo Duo System on eBay Super System 3.0 Card\n\nWhen the Turbo Duo was released the remaining inventory of the TurboGrafx-CD add-on had its price slashed, and as an effort to let others in on the game TTI also released a US version of the Super System 3.0 Card, allowing the TurboGrafx-16 with TurboGrafx-CD to play Super CD ROMÂ² games. The Super System 3.0 Card shipped with the 4-in-1 SuperCD that was also packaged with the Duo, meaning you were never without at least 4 great games to play. The 4-in-1 SuperCD was one of the best deals on the market at the time: two great platformers, a fun puzzle/party game, and one of the best shooters ever.\n\nShop for Super System 3.0 Card on eBay Pioneer LaserActive\n\nThe Pioneer LaserActive is an odd beast, and is quite rare and expensive. It is a Laser Disc player that features an expansion port on the front. There are three modules, called PACs, that were made for use with the LaserActive player: a karaoke PAC, a Sega Genesis PAC, and a TurboGrafx-16 PAC. The TurboGrafx-16 module features a TurboChip slot and a PC Engine-style controller port. With this module attached, the LaserActive can play TurboChip games, CD ROMÂ² games, Super CD ROMÂ² games, and, with an Arcade Card, Arcade CD ROMÂ² games. There are also a few LD-ROM games that require the TurboGrafx-16 PAC. These titles typically play video from the Laser Disc and use the TurboGrafx-16 hardware to generate an overlay.\n\nShop for Pioneer LaserActive System on eBay\n\nConsole Hardware Variations and Upgrades (Japan)\n\nPC Engine\n\nTiny, white, and square is the first release of the PC Engine console hardware. It features a single controller port, a large expansion port that fills almost the entire back of the system, and RF out. The initial release came with a 2-button pad without turbo switches. The basic shape of the pad is very comfortable and would not be changed until near the end of the system’s life. Pads with turbo switches were included later. This model was probably what was used as the basis for the US TurboGrafx-16 console.\n\nShop for PC Engine System on eBay PC Engine CD ROMÂ²\n\nThe PC Engine CD ROMÂ² add-on (pronounced CD ROM ROM) allows the PC Engine to play CD games. It is white, like the original PC Engine console, and the CD ROM drive itself is removable and identical to the US TurboGrafx-CD drive unit. The Japanese base unit, however, is very different from the US base unit. Whereas the TurboGrafx-CD, when attached to the Turbografx-16, looks like the T-shaped tetrad from Tetris, the PC Engine CD ROMÂ² base unit (called the IFU, for Interface Unit) allows the PC Engine and CD Drive to sit side-by side, much like the second model of the Sega CD paired with a Model 2 Genesis. A cover can be attached and the whole thing can be hauled around like a small briefcase, complete with handle.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine CD ROMÂ² on eBay PC Engine Core Grafx\n\nThe Core is a redesign of the PC Engine console. It is dark gray, similarly shaped, and includes a DIN 5 plug for AV out (with the appropriate cable) instead of RF out. It also features a CPU revision, the HuC6280a, which purportedly fixes some minor audio issues.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Core Grafx on eBay PC Engine GT\n\nIdentical to the US Turbo Express other than the logo printing.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine GT on eBay PC Engine Shuttle\n\nThe Shuttle is basically a PC Engine with a redesigned case, a custom expansion port which lacks CD support, and AV out. It does rather look like a spaceship, making the name quite appropriate.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Shuttle on eBay SuperGrafx\n\nThe SuperGrafx is a major revision of the PC Engine base architecture. It features an additional HuC6270 graphics chip with its own 64k of VRAM and bumps the system work RAM from 8KiB to 32KiB. The CPU remains unaltered save that it is the HuC6280a revision also used in the PC Engine Core. Thanks to the added graphics processor and memory, the SuperGrafx can display 2 independent backgrounds and up to 512 sprite pixels on a line, or up to 128 total on-screen sprites, though developers had to be careful to keep the sprites balanced between the two GPUs.The system features the same expansion port as the PC Engine, though due to differences in the shape of the case requires an adapter cable to connect to the PC Engine CD ROMÂ². The SuperGrafx was purportedly created as a response to the Super Famicom, but it didn’t attract much development. It carried a high price tag and only had 7 commercially released games to take advantage of the extra hardware. Fortunately, the SuperGrafx is backwards compatible with all PC Engine games, including CD games.\n\nShop for SuperGrafx on eBay PC Engine Core Grafx II\n\nThe Core II is a medium gray release probably intended to simplify the system and reduce cost. It uses the original HuC6280 instead of the revised version and features the same DIN 5 AV port as the Core.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Core Grafx II on eBay Super CD ROMÂ²\n\nThe Super CD ROMÂ² pairs the classic CD drive unit with a revised base unit that extends out behind the PC Engine instead of beside it. It is the same gray color as the Core II. It was designed to be connected to the SuperGrafx without an adapter. These changes are all largely cosmetic. The most important improvements are under the hood. The Super CD ROMÂ² features an updated BIOS (revision 3.0) and increases data storage from 64 KiB to 256 KiB. This allows CD games to cache more data from CD, meaning longer levels with more graphics and program data. During the 16-bit era it was very common for game publishers to put how big their game was in megabits (actually mebibits, or Mib) on the outside of the box. 256 KiB is 2 Mib. Some early PC Engine games are only 1 Mib. This means that the graphics and program data for a single level or area can be up to twice the size of some early game releases. Most of the best CD games on the system came out during the SuperCD era.\n\nShop forÂ Super CD ROMÂ² System on eBay PC Engine LT\n\nOne of the most sought-out models by collectors, this unit pairs a PC Engine bottom with integrated controls and a hinged LCD screen on top that closes over the system like a clam shell. It doesn’t use batteries but rather relies on a power adapter and therefore must be plugged in. It even has an expansion port and can be connected via a cable to a PC Engine CD ROMÂ² or Super CD ROMÂ² unit to play CD games.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine LT on eBay Super System 3.0 card\n\nRather than forcing consumers to buy a whole new CD expansion unit to play Super CD games, NEC bundled the 3.0 BIOS and the additional memory required to play Super CD ROMÂ² games into a system card you cam insert into the cartridge slot of your old PC Engine and CD ROMÂ² system.\n\nShop for Super System 3.0 Card on eBay PC Engine Duo\n\nIdentical to the US Turbo Duo with a slight change to the case for the region.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Duo on eBay Duo R\n\nA new model of the Duo was released with a slightly different shape and white color scheme. Some of the internals were revamped, likely to reduce cost and improve durability.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Duo R on eBay Arcade Card and Arcade Card Pro\n\nThis was the PC Engine’s last gasp to try to preserve market share in the face of the Super Famicom’s late era 16-bit dominance. It upgrades the SuperÂ CD ROMÂ² or Duo to 2304 KiB (18 Mib) of cache RAM. The Pro version is for use with the original PC Engine CD ROMÂ² and includes the System 3.0 BIOS, expanded SuperÂ CD ROMÂ² memory, and the added Arcade Card memory. There were not many dedicated releases that were Arcade CD ROMÂ² only, but those releases use the extra memory to feature tons of animation and graphical data. One of the most graphically impressive shooters of the 16-bit era and some of the best 16-bit console ports of Neo Geo fighting games are the expansion’s legacy. There are also some Super CD ROMÂ² games that were designed to detect the Arcade Card and use the extra memory for enhanced animation in cinema sequences.\n\nShop for PC Engine Arcade Cards on eBay Duo RX\n\nThis unit looks very similar to the Duo R, but features a 6-button controller that is different in design from the Avenue Pad 6.\n\nShop forÂ PC Engine Duo RX on eBay\n\nOfficial Mini Console\n\nTurboGrafx-16 Mini / PC Engine Mini\n\nEven though this is a software emulation solution, it is an rather official Hudson/Konami product and has decent performance solution for certain use cases. While die-hard retro gamers wouldnâ€™t choose it as their only TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine, itâ€™s a nice solution for either those new to classic gaming or want to re-explore something they grew up with or as an extra low-cost, easy family machine that works wonderfully on modern TVs via HDMI video output. Â It comes bundled with a a respectable game library of 58 titles (and there are hacks to allow you to add extra game ROMs) and the software interface is pretty nice â€” including a great interface for save states. Â The unit comes with one replica controller.\n\nShop for TurboGrafx-16 Mini System on eBay\n\nShop for TurboGrafx-16 Mini System on Amazon\n\nModern Video Output Options\n\nThe original TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine hardware was actually quite limited in native video output, offering only RF (pretty much the worst video output for game consoles). Â Unless you want to go super-retro, you’re going to want to go a different route (even Composite or S-Video would be very retro, but a stark upgrade to RF)\n\nOn old-school commercial CRT TVs (RF/Composite/S-Video)\n\nYou could stick with native RF output, but not advised\n\nIf you want a cheap way to have Composite output (those old school Yellow/Red/White cables), you could get an adapter like this Hyperkin AV Adapter (about $20).\n\nThe next step up would be the db GrafxBooster TTP. designed by DB Electronics, this unit adds many video outputs to the TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine using a Sony CXA1645Â video encoder IC. You can output Composite, S-Video, and RGB/Component out of this unit with the proper cables.\n\nEasiest Output to Most Modern Displays: HDMI adapters\n\nThe best rated HDMI adapter for the TurboGrtafx-16 as of this writing is the Hyperkin TG16 HDMI cable.\n\nRetailers like Amazon also carry the HDMI cable from LevelHike that has decent reviews, but not quite as strong as the Hyperkin.\n\nAnd donâ€™t forget, you do have the option of using the TurboGrafx-16 Mini (using software emulation) to play via HDMI.\n\nNote: Â Even though HDMI is a great format, the above solutions won’t have quite as good of image processing as the component video solution below. Â These HDMI solutions should only be viewed as the cheap and easy routes vs best video quality.\n\nCRTs and Flat Screens that Support RGB / Component video\n\nThe next step up would be the db GrafxBooster TTP. designed by DB Electronics, this unit adds many video outputs to the TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine using a Sony CXA1645Â video encoder IC. You can output Composite, S-Video, and RGB/Component out of this unit with the proper cables. Â For component output, you will need to use the Sega Genesis/Megadrive Model 2Â HD Retrovision Component cables\n\nTerra Onion’s Super SD System 3 offers composite and RGB AV output via a Genesis / MegaDrive model 2 mini-DIN style output. Â We will cover that in more detail below as it also offer’s extra features.\n\nIt’s also possible to mod a system for RGB Output. Â Feel free to check out RetroRGB’s TG16/PCE section for more info.\n\nHigh-End Video + Flash Card + ODE Hardware: Super SD System 3\n\nNot only does this piece of hardware provide you a video upgrade, but it also provides flash cart and ODE (Optical Disc Emulator – replacing the need for CD hardware) Â Terra Onion’s Super SD System 3 offers composite and RGB AV output via a Genesis / MegaDrive model 2 mini-DIN style output in addition to bootingÂ CD or HuCard games via an SD card. Â The unit connects to your PC Engine console by means of the expansion port (also compatible with Core Grafx, Core Grafx2 and Super Grafx models) emulating not only CD-ROM units but also System Cards, while at the same time it provides high-quality RGB video output.\n\nShop for Super SD System 3 on eBay\n\nShop for Super SD System 3 from Stone Age Gamer\n\nGame Library\n\nGames That Defined the TurboGrafx-16Â – If you want to check out the games that made the biggest impact on the original TG16 demographic, this guide will take you through the biggest titles.\n\nThe TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine Shmups Library – The TG16/PC Engine is one of the VERY BEST consoles on which to play old-school scrolling shooters. There’s so many great shmups on the system that I had to break the guide into two parts: Part 1: Console Exclusives and Part 2: Arcade Ports (and don’t overlook part 2 as it still shows some of the very best ports and some hidden gems)\n\nThe Cheapest TurboGrafx-16 Games Worth Your TimeÂ -Â If you need a good place to start your collection on a budget, this list should be your first stop.Â It will cover most of the TG16 essentials.\n\nTurboGrafx-16 Hidden GemsÂ – If you’ve already got the most popular games under your belt, this Hidden Gems list will help you expand into the best under-appreciated games\n\nRarest and Most Valuable TurboGrafx & PC-Engine GamesÂ -Â Be on the lookout for these valuable titles\n\nTurboGrafx-16 Games That Pushed The Limits of Graphics & SoundÂ – If you’d like to check out some of the titles that made the most of the NEC hardware, give this guide a look. Â You might find some interesting technical gems.\n\nGame Formats\n\nHuCard / TurboChip: This game cartridge form factor is only slightly larger, and about twice as thick, as a credit card. The cases they came in are the same size and shape as a CD case. The HuCards are housed in rubbery plastic sleeves and held in place by a plastic clip or a blob of glue. HuCard/TurboChip games can be stored in their cases in the same CD racks with their CD ROMÂ² brethren.\n\nSystem Cards: The System Cards are HuCards that provide the CD ROM BIOS code, and sometimes cache memory, so that the PC Engine or TurboGrafx-16 can control the PC Engine CD ROMÂ² add-on. There are several system card releases (see Console Hardware and Upgrades). The original PC Engine CD ROMÂ² is not able to play any CD games without a system card in the cartridge slot, and later CD ROM hardware variations required the Arcade Card to play Arcade CD ROMÂ² games.\n\nCD ROMÂ², Super CD ROMÂ², and Arcade CD ROMÂ²: I don’t have to tell you what a CD looks like and we’ve covered quite fully what it can do. Suffice it to say, the CD ROM is the PC Engine’s gift to console gaming and probably the most profound legacy of any home console system.\n\nAccessories (US)\n\nTurboTap\n\nThe worldâ€™s first multi-tap. It is a rectangular block with 5 controller ports and a cable out the other end that connects to the single controller port on the front of the TurboGrafx-16. Unfortunately this device is required for any number of players greater than one, but many TurboGrafx-16 games support 2 or 5 player play so it is a worthwhile investment.\n\nShop for TurboTap on eBay TurboPad\n\nBasic system controller. Comfortable gamepad with a responsive rocker pad and 2 action buttons with built-in turbo capabilities.\n\nShop for TurboPad on eBay TurboStick\n\nJoystick for the TurboGrafx-16 with variable turbo and a nice, large base and bright orange joystick knob. It is quite durable, too. I used one of these for years and it never even flinched. Comparable in quality and durability to the NES Advantage, though quite a bit lighter. The joystick knobs of the TurboStick and NES Advantage are identical in shape and threading, and I often switched them, creating an all-black TurboStick and a rather unattractive NES Advantage.\n\nShop for Turbo Stick on eBay TurboBooster\n\nThis add-on plugs into the expansion port and mimicks, in appearance, the plastic dust cover, keeping the TurboGrafx-16â€²s uniform shape. It adds AV Stereo out. It was originally priced at $30.\n\nShop for Turbo Booster on eBayTurboBooster Plus\n\nNearly identical to the TurboBooster, but with save memory included so you can save your high scores or, in a few cases, your progress, without having to input annoying passwords. Useful for saving games for Dragon’s Curse and the Neutopia games.\n\nAccessories (Japan, Unique Only, Highlights Only)\n\nAV Booster\n\nAttaches to the expansion port on the PC Engine and adds AV ports, just like the TurboBooster, but much smaller, to match the smaller PC Engine’s size.\n\nShop for AV Booster on eBay Tennokoe Bank\n\nA HuCard with save storage that lets you store or swap your CD ROMÂ² unit’s (or Tennokoe 2’s) save memory to one of 4 storage banks. You cannot store specific save files, only the entire save memory. You can also swap in place, so you can maintain a total of 5 save configurations: 4 on the card and 1 on the CD ROMÂ² unit itself.\n\nShop for Tennokoe Bank on eBay Tennokoe 2\n\nAttaches to the expansion port on the PC Engine and adds save memory, like the TurboBooster Plus, but smaller and without AV outputs.\n\nShop for Tennokoe 2 on eBay MemoryBase 128\n\nA special save memory unit that plugs into the controller port and allows a controller to be daisy-chained from it. Support for this peripheral is limited to certain titles and it cannot replace a standard save unit.\n\nShop for Memory Base 128 on eBay NEC Avenue Pad 3\n\nA three button PC Engine pad. It was released to coincide with Forgotten Worlds on Super CD ROMÂ², a game that really needs three action buttons. With a standard, two button pad you have to use Select for one of the functions, which can be cumbersome in play. A few other titles can specifically take advantage of the third button, and when it isn’t explicitly supported it simply mirrors the Select button, which can be useful by itself.\n\nShop for NEC Avenue Pad 3 on eBay NEC Avenue Pad 6\n\nAn excellent six button pad designed for release at the same time as Street Fighter II’. Some later games also support it, including all the Arcade CD fighting game releases. Definitely bests the comfort and response of the default SNES pad and might even be competition for the Sega Genesis six button pad.\n\nShop for NEC Avenue Pad 6 on eBay\n\nFlash Carts\n\nA flash cart is a video game cartridge that will allow you to play games (ROMs) on real hardware. This is not only a way for you to try out a full library of games on original hardware, but also make switching games easier and not worrying about cleaning cartridges as much.\n\nIn most cases, playing a game from a flash cart is identical to playing the actual game cart. Flash carts can vary in features between models, each with their own pros and cons. Most flash carts are extremely easy to use.\n\nTurbo Everdrive (from Krikzz): $86\n\nTypically the Gold Standard of Flash cart brands, its hard to go wrong with Krikzz’s Everdrive as long as you know the limitations. Â Both PCEngine and TurboGrafx-16 systems are supported (however, Cart may not work properly with region modded systems). Â Even though, this should be obvious to experienced retro gamers, the Turbo Everdrive only takes care of cartridge-based games on the TG16/PC Engine that used the HuCard format. Â If you have CD-based games, you’ll need to still had a CD player, have discs to read or use an ODE (like the Super SD System below)\n\nThe TurboEverdrive boastsÂ Instant loading and even hasÂ Street Fighter II mapper support. Â The cartridge features and on-board reset button to let you change games quickly. Â Â The Turbo Everdrive supports MicroSD cards up to 32GB and uses the FAT32 file system. Â It also has 4Mbyte of RAM memory.\n\nShop for Turbo Everdrive on eBay\n\nShop for Turbo Everdrive on Amazon\n\nShop for Turbo Everdrive at Castlemania Games\n\nShop for Turbo Everdrive at Stone Age Gamer\n\nSuper SD System 3 (from Terraonion): $290\n\nThis is part flash cart, part ODE (Optical Disc Emulator – replacing the need for CD hardware), part AV mod! You can boot CD or HuCard games via an SD card. It also offers composite and RGB AV output via a Genesis / MegaDrive model 2 mini-DIN style output. To quote the above link…\n\nSuper SD System 3 connects to your PC Engine console by means of the expansion port (also compatible with Core Grafx, Core Grafx2 and Super Grafx models) emulating not only CD-ROM units but also System Cards, while at the same time it provides high-quality RGB video output.\n\nA simple and intuitive interface, compatible with CD-ROM (.cue) and HuCard (.pce) images.\n\nIntegrated System Cards for CD-ROM2, Super CD-ROM2 and Arcade CD-ROM2 systems. You can play any of your games with no need for the System Card or the original accessory.\n\nSuper SD System 3 lets you save games directly on the MicroSD card memory, which means you have a virtually endless capacity with no need for any other accessories.\n\nThanks to the integrated RAM memory, loading games is practically instantaneous for ROM in the .pce (HuCards) format and much faster than usual with ISOs (.cue) for CD-ROM titles.\n\nCompatible with high-capacity MicroSD cards (up to 128 GB). RGB AV output, with composed video and stereo sound (Mini DIN connector compatible with the Mega Drive 2 cable). Software can be updated free of charge.\n\nAs you might be able to figure out from the above the Super SD System is an excellent option if you want to get a simple authentic PC Engine setup but invest in a modern hardware companion to take things to the next level.\n\nShop for Super SD System 3 on eBay\n\nShop for Super SD System 3 from Stone Age Gamer\n\nFurther Comparison\n\nPlease see this link from Stone Age Gamer for a comparison table between the Turbo Everdrive and the Super SD System 3Â\n\nDIY Low Cost Flash HuCard\n\nHandmade flash card that is simple and affordable. It is a 1 MiB (8 Mib) flash device with a USB interface and software that allows you to switch regions and even eliminate the US region check code. Does not support any games larger than 8 Mib (Street Fighter II’ was the only commercial title that meets this criteria).\n\nImporting\n\nJapanese HuCard games have a different cartridge pin out from US TurboChip games. In order to use Japanese HuCards in a US system you need an adapter or a switchable system mod.\n\nTo use US TurboChips in a Japanese PC Engine you need more than an adapter. US games do a region check on the system, a check a PC Engine can’t pass. If you have a PC Engine and want to play TurboChip games you have to open the system and cut a particular pin on the CPU. This solution apparently does have a couple rare incompatibilities, so it isn’t perfect. Some people perform mods that allow not only switching the necessary data lines but also disconnecting and reconnecting the critical CPU pin, thus preserving compatibility as well.\n\nAll CD games lack region protection and will work on US and Japanese systems, provide the proper System Card is available.\n\nThe CD ROMÂ² System Cards are all region-specific and have the same constraints as HuCard and TurboChip games. There are no US region Arcade Cards, only Super System 3.0 and System 2.0 cards.\n\nJapanese controllers use a smaller connector than US TurboGrafx-16 TurboPad controllers. The US Turbo Duo and later TurboPads use the Japanese-style connector. This means that earlier controller peripherals were not compatible with the later Turbo Duo or Japanese units without a converter. TTI tried to remedy this by selling TurboTaps (see Accessories, above) that were modified to connect to the Turbo Duo with the smaller connector but featured 5 old-style ports so you could use old-style controllers. The inverse was available from a few tinkering fans and later from Turbo Zone Direct, the company that took over sales of the remaining inventory from TTI when it finally folded.\n\nEmulation\n\nSince our last update, the emulation scene is much improved. While most emulators do have some very minor issues, mostly finicky issues with sound or rare controller input delays, they largely look and sound great.\n\nEmulation on PCs\n\nThis used to be the $20 Magic Engine, but no more. ME is still a great emulator, but it is no longer the best. Many still find it the easiest to use, however. It uses a custom, non-Windows GUI, much like many other emulators that originated at about the same time and earlier. ME’s flaws are minor and include the lack of a modern Windows GUI and a volume balance problem between PSG, Red Book, and ADPCM audio that requires adjustment, something you can do manually within the program.\n\nMost Accurate Emulation: Mednafen is the clear winner. Mednafen is a multi-system emulator designed for Windows, Linux, Mac, and a few others. Source code is also available for enterprising types. It is able to tackle almost any PC Engine game thrown at it like a champ. What keeps Mednafen from being perfect? No GUI. There are a couple 3rd party GUI game loaders, but you still have to make most of your configuration changes using hotkeys or in the config file. If you don’t mind the command line, you won’t have a more compatible experience shy of real hardware.\n\nBest Windows Emulator: Ootake takes the prize in this category. Though developed in Japan, the menus are all in English, and the accompanying text files have rudimentary English translations as well. It isn’t quite as good as Mednafen for accuracy, but it has a proper Windows interface, is pretty easy to use, has pretty good emulation accuracy, roughly matching Magic Engine, and it’s available for free. Not only that, but it’s constantly being updated, and just in the past couple years has had recording and playback support added to it. Like Mednafen, the source code is available for those who want to play around.\n\nBest Emulator for Tool-Assisted Play: If you want to get into creating Tool-Assisted Speedruns, you’ll want BizHawk, the multi-system emulator designed by the TAS Videos community at tasvideos.org. It draws heavily on Mednafen’s code base, though it doesn’t share Mednafen’s accuracy. It can be difficult to use at times due to the complexity of some of the functions, and it does have some issues with a few PC Engine games, but you can do some crazy stuff with it, like recording gameplay inputs and playing them back, frame advance, memory viewing, and encoding recordings to AVI.\n\nNintendo Virtual Console\n\nStarting on the Nintendo Wii, the Nintendo Virtual Console supports a pretty solid number of TurboGrafx-16 games with its specialized emulator, including a few CD and Super CD titles. Emulation quality is generally pretty good. A couple Japanese games are even offered, untranslated of course, including Gradius II and the legendary Dracula X. This is the most affordable legal alternative to buying a physical copy of Dracula X. Games are available for purchase on an individual basis and are relatively affordable.\n\nMultiple Devices/Handhelds/Consoles: RetroArch\n\nIf you are either somebody that enjoys a consistent emulator interface across a handful of devices (like an Android or iOS device, a Raspberry Pi or older consoles and handhelds), RetroArch is an established front-end that can install a variety of emulator cores that have common controller and system configurations. See our guide: RetroArch: The Emulation Ecosystem Powering Consistency & Customizability\n\nCurrently, the top recommendation for a TG16/PCE core on RetroArch is Mednafen. Â It works quite well on most hardware.\n\nDedicated FPGA: MiSTer\n\nMuch like Analogueâ€™s high end clone systems, MiSTer utilizes FPGA for hardware-based emulation, striving for the most accurate experience aside from the original hardware. See our full guide for the MiSTer FPGA project. The MiSTer project supports a lot of different systems in the forms of â€œcoresâ€ and the TurboGrax-16/PC Engine is one of the more mature and technically impressive cores.\n\nâ€œThe CD implementation is very sensitive to read timings, and MiSTer is the only implementation that gets it correct, in cases, more consistent and precise even than real hardware which is notoriously inconsistentâ€ –MiSTer developer, Kitrinx\n\nWe now have a cycle-accurate MiSTer FPGA core that delivers the best PC Engine emulation experience possible anywhere, ever. And not by a little, MiSTerâ€™s PCE core is objectively more accurate than any other option. According to SmokeMonster, one of the leading voices in MiSTer community: â€œthe PC Engine coreÂ plays excellent- so well that I sold my RGB modded PC-Engine Core Grafxâ€\n\nThe core was built by many of the same people who have been working on PCE for twenty-plus years, and perfected by HDL experts like Srg320, Sorge, Kitrinx, and others. Srg320 initially used logic state analyzing to create the initial core from which the core blossomed. The core is a hardware model of a TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine/SuperGrafx/SuperCD/Duo in HDL, with all system cards integrated, from Super System 1 to the Arcade Card. In hardware terms, you can think of it as an RGB modded SuperGrafx with Super CD-Rom2, Arcade Card, Memory Bank 128, OSSC, and every controller and peripheral ever made by NEC.\n\nWhen CD support was added recently, many people didnâ€™t realize that the entire core essentially had an engine swap, and the processor, GPU, and other components were replaced with new cycle accurate soft-cores based on chip decaps and investigations by Furrtek, David Shadoff, Kitrinx/Rysha, and others. It also has the only hardware-modeled color palette implementation ever, based on new work by Furrtek, Artemio, and coded by Kitrinx. Few cores can rightfully claim â€œcycle accuracyâ€ but PC Engine is one of them, and it is a testament to the level and quality of work that has gone into the core, which spans decades.\n\nThe primary difference between software emulators is that the MiSTer core takes advantage of FPGAâ€™s killer featureâ€”like a real PCB, FPGAs can do multiple things at exactly the same time. This is especially important for PCE because its video controller circuit adds wait states in order to simultaneously rotate CPU access and video display states. This functionality allows the FPGA implementation to go where no software emulator could in 20+ years of development.\n\nIn fact, the FPGA core is so accurate that if you load PC Engine games in SuperGrafx mode, you get the exact same quirks that you have on a real SuperGrafx when its switch is in the wrong position (the console had a switch for SGX/PCE modes for backwards compatibility). On the audio side of things, the coreâ€™s sound is equally bespoke, with proper filters for every individual sound channel tuned by Kitrinx using Artemioâ€™s MD Fourier software.\n\nBeyond simply replicating hardware, the core is built within the MiSTer framework and thus can expand upon it with new options like audio and video filters, cheats, overscan trimming, CD audio balance adjustment, more sprites on screen (reduced flickering), etc. It supports 100% of the PCE family library by means of implementations that users might not notice, like its Memory Base 128 support for example.Â\n\nAll controllers have been implemented as well, from 2 to 6-button, along with multi-tap support and even mouse and pachinko controllers, all via USB, or with real original controllers via SNAC thanks to David Shadoffâ€™s hard work. SNAC serial add-ons are controller dongles that allow native controllers to interface directly to the FPGA with zero lag.\n\nDue to all this impressive development, the MiSTer is currently the most accurate way to play PC Engine & TurboGrafx 16 family of hardware and software outside of the relatively expensive and complex original hardware.\n\nHomebrew\n\nThe PC Engine homebrew scene used to be pretty low-key, but it has seen a resurgence as of late. There are currently six major titles that have been released commercially, a few others in ROM format or bundled, and a few tech demos. There are an additional 6-9 titles currently under development by several different developers. Here are the titles released commercially which are currently available. Any of these titles can be purchased at Good Deal Games or, excepting Revival Chase, directly from the developers. (NOTE: Thus far, only CD titles have been released, but Aetherbyte has a cart title in the works on a homemade cartridge.)\n\nMindRec: A programming and web development company that does PC Engine development on the side, if only because BT Garner of TurboList fame is the man in charge. They were the first on the commercial homebrew scene for the PC Engine and have been dormant for some time, but with the reprint of Meteor Blaster DX there are indications that change is coming.\n\nImplode: A colored block puzzler with explosives. Included on the CD are Crash and Humpball as well, a couple bonuses that will hopefully not keep you from the main attraction.\n\nMeteor Blaster DX: A souped-up Asteroids clone. Recently reprinted on proper pressed CDs (no more CDRs). Includes a Caravan mode and the puzzle game Loop as extras.\n\nAetherbyte: A veteran programmer, a talented newcomer, and an amazing artist have created what seems to be a classic arcade revival on the TurboGrafx-16. One of their hallmarks is insisting on using chiptunes soundtracks despite making CD games (which typically feature Red Book audio soundtracks). Once you hear their chiptune work, however, you’ll agree that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.\n\nInsanity: A colorful Berzerk port with a dark, droning, retro-techno soundtrack. Has an Xbox360 release as well.\n\nPyramid Plunder: A Pac-Man clone that mixes things up with powerups, multi-screen levels, and level and enemy graphics that change as you advance through the game.\n\nFrozen Utopia: Several creative individuals from the PC Engine community who are, together, a powerful force for gaming.\n\nMysterious Song: A port of a DOS RPG with redone content. Has cut scenes and voice acting as well as a suitable CD soundtrack. It is a little on the short side but hews closely to classic RPG sensibilities. You’ll feel just like it’s 1990!\n\nTouko: A mysterious Frenchman with amazing PC Engine powers. He only has one complete commercial title so far, but it won’t be his last. Like Aytherbyte he’s sticking closely to the arcade classics that the PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 missed out on back in the day.\n\nRevival Chase: A remake of the classic arcade game Lock n’ Chase. Exclusively available with the classic games magazine Revival, which, fortunately, has a US version. The US issue this title is paired with is 45. Here is a link to help you procure this one. Includes a hidden shooter.\n\nAffordability\n\nA PC Engine or TurboGrafx-16 unit is one of the more expensive retro consoles, running $65 to $180Â without all the packaging. Â You can check our Retro Console Hardware Price Guide for more detailed breakdown of values for different models and conditions of packaging.\n\nGetting a TurboGrafx-16 with TurboGrafx-CD and Super System 3.0 Card can be a pricy affair, and finding the TurboGrafx-CD can sometimes be a challenge. Cheaper, though still not exactly cheap, would be some variety of Duo or PC Engine with PC Engine CD ROMÂ² and Japanese Super System 3.0 or Arcade Card. Â Again,\n\ncheck our Retro Console Hardware Price Guide for more detailed breakdown\n\nUS TurboChip games are comparatively expensive, depending on the title. Most of the cheap games are the ones few people want. That said, there are some good titles that were produced in large enough numbers that the prices are still reasonable. Japanese HuCard games are significantly cheaper… in Japan. Prices get jacked up on eBay when the items are being sold internationally, and international shipping is usually expensive. The cheapest prices are on Amazon.co.jp, but there is no option for international shipping. If you have a contact in Japan who has the time and patience, however, this can be a great option to pick up some very reasonably priced titles.\n\nWith the exception of some of the more in-demand titles, CD ROMÂ² games of various stripes can be pretty affordable, with the US titles generally costing more than the JPN titles. The up side is that you can burn the truly rare and expensive titles from ISOs and play them on US or Japanese systems after youâ€™ve emptied your bank account for the required hardware.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Wiiâ€™s Virtual Console is the most affordable solution for playing many of the US TurboGrafx-16 games available through the service. For key titles like Military Madness it is the most affordable way to enjoy critical classics by far. Now that the Virtual Console has some CD and Super CD titles, there’s even more reason to look to theWii for your TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine fix.\n\nWhen you click on links to various merchants on this site and make a purchase, this can result in this site earning a commission.\n\nAffiliate programs and affiliations include, but are not limited to, the eBay Partner Network or Amazon Associates."
