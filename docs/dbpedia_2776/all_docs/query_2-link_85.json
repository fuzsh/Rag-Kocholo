        "text": "Edia today announced Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection 2, a new package of classic titles for Switch. Note that the title may change at a later date.\n\nThe upcoming collection will contain the PC Engine version of Valis IV in addition to the SEGA Genesis editions of Syd of Valis and Valis: The Fantasm Soldier.\n\nThe original Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection previously released on Switch (with an English release to boot), which contained Valis: The Fantasm Soldier, Valis II, and Valis III from the PC Engine. Some new elements were included such as Sound Mode and Visual Mode, along with a “rewind” function. All of these features will be back for Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection 2.\n\nA release date for the collection has not been announced at this time. However, it should eventually be made available in the west just like the original Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection. We’ll bring you mode information as further details surface.\n\nSource\n\nShare this:\n\nRelated"
