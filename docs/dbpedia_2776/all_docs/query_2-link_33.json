Recruited by the emperor during the past, Toe guarded Megas's tower base during the events of Valis II. After Haizen's defeat at hands of Yuuko, Toe had to wait for the Valis warrior to also confront him. It was a matter of time for them to fight while Megas himself watched personally their battle. Toe was in disadvantage and begged his master to help him, but Megas didn't respond and let Yuuko finally kill him, thus ending the battle and his life.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nToe is an scared and effeminate warrior, but a loyal general of Megas, although not the best one. He highly respects Megas and looks up on him, but sometimes his nervousness makes him to ask Megas for help he knows he will not get.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nTou is an swordsman. He can jump in circles quickly with his sword to attack from air. On the ground he can use his sword normally to attack at range or launch a fire slash from it toward his enemies. To make his moves even stronger, he can make a mirror clone of himself.\n\nIn Valis SD/Syd of Valis, Tou's skills in battle are almost totally changed.Here he isn't a swordsman anymore, but he attacks by flying and diving from the air. He can also shoot multiple fire balls from his hands. The platform where the player stands makes the fight a bit harder.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nToe appeared in the PCE-CD/TGCD version of Valis II as the fifth boss and the last before Megas. In Valis SD/Syd of Valis, although unmentioned, Toe appears in the cover of the Japanese version and in the second act of the last stage as a mini-boss without dialogue.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
