For the Famicom version of this game, see Mugen Senshi Valis (Famicom). For the Sega Genesis version of this game, see Valis. For the Turbo CD version of this game, see Mugen Senshi Valis (Turbo CD).\n\nMugen Senshi Valis (夢幻戦士ヴァリス, Mugen Senshi Valis Valis: The Fantasm Soldier) was the first game in the Valis series. Telenet Japan originally developed and published Valis in 1986 for the MSX and PC-88 home computers. It is a side-scrolling platformer. The Valis series stars a Japanese schoolgirl named Yūko Asou (麻生 優子, Yūko Asou Asou Yūko), who uses a mystical sword called Valis to defend Earth, the spirit world and the dream world. Wielding the game's titular sword, the main character fights through each level's enemies while jumping across ledges, then confronts a boss at the end of each level. At certain points in the game, gameplay pauses, and cinema scenes regarding the game's storyline play.\n\nThe original Valis first came out on the MSX and PC-88 home computers. The gameplay is mostly straightforward, although Yuko has to vaguely look through levels to find jewels strewn about the rather large landscape. Unfortunately, these computers were not very powerful and as a result, the game is fairly difficult to play. The first game was remade several times, once for the Famicom in 1987, where it was made less linear and more adventure like. Next it was remade for the Sega Genesis, where it reverted to a straightforward linear run and slash game with better graphics. And finally, after the final game of the series was published, it was released for the PC-Engine CD, which is generally considered the best remake of the game, as well as the best product in the series. The game spawned three sequels including Valis II, Valis III, Valis IV.\n\nTitle screen"
