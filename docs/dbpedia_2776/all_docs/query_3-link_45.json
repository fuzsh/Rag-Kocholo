        "text": "SINGAPORE– Drone Logistics Ecosystem (DLE) is forging a partnership with Sedaxis Advanced Materials, one of India’s fast growing companies in the Composites equipment, 3d printing and materials space. With a 25+ year old presence in Composites and a ~ 4-year-old presence in Additive Manufacturing using Polymers and Composites, this partnership would bring the latest developments in composites and additive manufacturing to DLE members. This can further help set up collaborations with companies, research institutes and universities involved in the AM Centre of Excellence jointly launched by Sedaxis and their academic partner VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology) in Chennai, India. Collaborations can include education on Additive Manufacturing of Composites, Technology implementation, Pilot studies and Scaling up activities. With a state-of-the-art Centre comprising AM technologies across SLS (selective laser sintering), FDM (fused deposition modelling), Continuous fibre co-extrusion (Extrusion) and Resin, DLE member companies can now tap into the extensive benefits provided by Sedaxis’s additive manufacturing arm for their drone design enhancement, performance optimization, supply chain optimization, prototyping, R&D and series production activities.\n\n“The global drone industry has important ramifications for border security, food security, near-mile and last-mile deliveries, healthcare supply chains and more. As with any aerial vehicle, weight reduction is a critical aspect to improve both range and payloads. Composites have been proven to do just that and it’s time the drone industry adopts this as a standard for most of their products. DLE is an excellent global initiative for members to collaborate on product development, market access, consulting and contract manufacturing and we at Sedaxis are thrilled to be able to contribute to these objectives and help grow the safe and sustainable adoption of drones across industries”, said Mr. Vishwanath Godavarty, Business Head, Sedaxis 3D Printing.\n\n“What makes the rapidly emerging drone industry exciting is the unlimited access to new technologies that did not existed couple of decades ago. The industry is driven by young entrepreneurs keen to explore new material and more sustainable material compered to the traditional aerospace industry that is limited to stringing certification processes. Together with Sedaxis we would explore further the application of additive manufacturing for prototyping and small-scale production, while looking into implementation of manufacturing processes for scaleup and mass production”, Dr Ali Jahanshahi, Global Executive Director of DLE.\n\nDrone Logistics Ecosystem™\n\nDLE is a global/virtual network of Companies, Universities, the Public/Governments, and Investors operating in the drone logistics industry.
