        "text": "n/a\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier, called Mugen Senshi Valis (夢幻戦士ヴァリス) in Japan, is a 1991 action game for the Sega Mega Drive. It was originally released for the MSX, PC-8801, and X1 home computers in 1986.\n\nDespite being the first game in the Valis series, the Mega Drive version is a remake that was released after Valis III was ported to the console.\n\nStory\n\nYuko is walking when the weather repeatedly changes from raining to dry. Yuko notes that she dreamed about it the night before, and in that dream, she heard a voice call her. Suddenly, her friend Reiko appears, speaking in a very unusual fashion before leaving \"for a while.\" While Yuko wonders why Reiko was acting weird, a monster appears out of nowhere and attacks. The voice from Yuko's dream calls out again — this time coming from someone in real life — and that person throws Yuko the Valis sword, allowing Yuko to attack not only this monster but all the monsters coming in.\n\nThat person turns out to be Valia, a being from a fantasy world that exists in another dimension, but is bound to the dimension Earth is in (\"the real world\") by the internal \"Yin\"/\"Yang\" balance of people's souls — which has come out of balance because of Yin's power \"Vecanta,\" which has caused \"people\" to \"entertain\" themselves with war. Rogles, a king of another dimension, is behind this manipulation. To ensure his victory, Rogles took the power of \"Yang,\" put it in the Phantasm Jewel, and broke it into pieces, scattering them across dimensions and guarding them with his best guards. Yuko most now collect the pieces and use the power of \"Yang\" to defeat Rogles.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is a platformer played as the Japanese schoolgirl Yuko Asou.

The magic power can be selected from the pause menu with START . She can cast the magic with + . Magic abilities cost magic points, which can be restored by finding items.\n\nYuko has a hit point gauge that indicates her health. She loses hit points when she takes damage from enemies, but she can restore her health by finding items. She loses a life when she loses all of her hit points and must restart the stage. The game ends if the player runs out of lives.\n\nMagic\n\nEarthquake Causes an earthquake that attacks enemies on the ceiling and the ground. Costs 6 MP.
