        "text": "Overview\n\nAlthough the first incarnation on the PC Engine, this is the second in the series of heroic schoolgirl platform games. It’s a very simple game at heart and the action is more focused on enemy patterns than intense platforming. Although your weapon is a sword, it is capable of firing energy bolts which can be powered up by collecting icons, as well as switched to alternative attacks such as two-way, homing missile and a nice wave attack that destroys enemy shots. There are a selection of minor bosses dotted around each level, with the primary boss encounter announced Darius-like at the end.\n\nComment\n\nValis II is a very uneven game, in all respects. The graphics range from downright horrible to quite pleasing from level to level - sprites are merely adequately drawn and animated and as a package the game looks a bit shoddy and unprofessional. There are some nice tunes, but they use a range of terribly cheap sounding synths to produce them, and it’s only nostalgia that saves many of them for me. The gameplay is simple and controls are responsive enough, but the level design does let the game down, especially in later levels that slowly become over-long and a chore to play. But despite all this, there are moments of enjoyment to be had. As one of the earlier Telenet games, it’s typical of their output - lots of visual scenes, iffy graphics and slightly crummy gameplay, but strangely hard to actually dislike.\n\nsunteam_paul"
