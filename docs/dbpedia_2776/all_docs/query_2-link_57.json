        "text": "This article is over 2 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nThe Nintendo Switch will get more ports of classic Valis games. Edia announced that it has started developing Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 for the console. It will contain the 1991 PC Engine release of Valis IV and the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) versions of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier and SD Valis.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSD Valis was an arranged version of Valis II with chibi character designs, while Valis IV was the final mainline title in the series. Even though the SNES version of Super Valis IV is available in the North American Nintendo Switch Online lineup, there were many changes from the original release. The inclusion of Valis IV in the new collection will complete the original PC Engine tetralogy on the Switch.\n\nEdia had previously compiled the first three titles and released them on Nintendo Switch in late 2021. It also released the English localization of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection on the North American Nintendo Store on February 10, 2022.\n\nThe company will release the second collection in a similar way to the first one. It will first hold a crowdfunding session where people in Japan can literally pre-order the package with additional bonuses. Afterward. it will put up the compilation on Nintendo eShop.\n\nJust like the first collection, players will be able to rewind their playthroughs with a new feature not available on the original platforms. The compilation will also include art and music gallery modes.\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection 2, which contains Valis IV, SD Valis, and the Sega Genesis version of Valis, will be available on Nintendo Switch."
