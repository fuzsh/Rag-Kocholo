        "text": "https://retrocdn.net/images/0/04/RenovationProducts_logo.png\n\nRenovation Products was Telenet Japan's US publisher of Sega Mega Drive games, publishing both Telenet's own games and several non-Telenet Japan titles. When Telenet stopped developing on Sega's systems in 1993, Sega acquired the studio (though not before publishing a single SNES game, Telenet's Doomsday Warrior) and they promptly disappeared.\n\nCompany\n\nVery few of Renovation's games were released in Europe, however a deal was at one point struck with Ubisoft for distribution in that region[3], which was subsequently challenged by Sega for undisclosed reasons[4]. No games were officially released, however, and Ubisoft themselves did not publish a game for Mega Drive hardware until Street Racer in 1995.\n\nPresident Hideaki Irie would later become COO of Sega of America .\n\nGaiares advertising campaign\n\nMain article: Jamie Bunker.\n\nIn 1990, Renovation Products selected one of their game testers, Jamie Bunker, to be the spokesperson for the upcoming Sega Mega Drive game Gaiares' advertising campaign.[7] Bunker posed with the game's United States release in a series of three advertisements, with each labeling the seventeen-year old spokesman a \"professional gamer\". Contrasting with the often juvenile and exaggerative statements of other game advertisements of the day, Renovation Products' advertisements simply featured a visibly genuine Bunker presenting the game with a recommendation of its quality, and has become one of the Mega Drive era's most fondly-remembered advertising campaigns.\n\nSoftography"
