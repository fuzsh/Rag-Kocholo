        "text": "Valispace is a collaborative Requirements and Systems Engineering Tool that allows you to derive product requirements from high-level needs, design your system taking into account physics calculations, automatically and continuously verify your product and lets engineers of all disciplines review and converge on optimal solutions in agile engineering cycles.\n\nThe software allows you and your team to work more efficiently when building complex hardware such as satellites, power plants, or autonomous vehicles, etc.\n\nIn a product cycle, there are various softwares such as ERP, PLM which aid in the product development. Valispace acts as your central Requirements and Systems Engineering Tool with an AI-assisted and Data-Driven Systems Engineering (DDSE) approach, which can be used in the different parts of the project and streamline your entire engineering process, from requirements definition to system design, verification, and validation, as shown in the image below.\n\nValispace is a collaborative and intuitive browser-based software and can be deployed both in the cloud or in-house on company servers.\n\nSome reasons you might want to use Valispace:\n\nToday, all your engineering calculations are done in isolated Excel sheets which are not connected\n\nYou want to solve an engineering problem and be able to track and trace the history and also share your work\n\nYour team needs central Data Storage with always up-to-date values\n\nYou want to be notified automatically when someone changes a design value that will impact your productsâ requirements\n\nTrack every parent and child requirement of the system and make sure that they are verified at the end of the product cycle.\n\nUse the help of AI to write, improve, breakdown and find inconsistencies in your requirements.\n\nTo get some ideas of what you can use Valispace for, visit our website.\n\nValispace is continuously looking for ways to Empower Engineers. Currently, our software provides the following features for you and your team:"
