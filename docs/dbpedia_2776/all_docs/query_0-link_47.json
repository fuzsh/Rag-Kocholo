        "text": "Pi Model or other hardware: Raspberry Pi 3 B+\n\nPower Supply used: 2.5A Power Supply from canakit\n\nRetroPie Version Used: 4.4\n\nBuilt From: Pre made SD Image on RetroPie website\n\nUSB Devices connected: keyboard, controller(when I want to play 2 players game)\n\nController used: PS3 controller\n\nError messages received: no error message\n\nLog found in /dev/shm/runcommand.log (if relevant):\n\nGuide used: Followed basic starting guide from official website, and MSX section of RetroPie-Setup from Github\n\nFile: all msx files\n\nEmulator: lr-bluemsx\n\nAttachment of config files:\n\nHow to replicate the problem:\n\nI just bought a new Raspberry Pi 3 B+, and installed latest version (4.4) of RetroPie as instructed. Everything looked ok, except msx emulator. It was not pre-installed, so I had to manually installed the lr-bluemsx emulator from optional package.\n\nI copied all msx bios in /home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS/Machines/Shared Roms/ and game roms in /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/msx as instructed. But it does not work. The game lists show up without problem, but it just go back to the game list screen if I lauch the game from the list. no error message, nothing happen. Lauch, become black screen for 1-2 seconds, go back to the game list. Not a single game work with bluemsx. I launched with verbose logging, nothing shows up. There must be something wrong.\n\nI tried to install lr-fmsx emulator, and most of games work in fmsx without problem, so I can tell there is no problem on my game roms or bios, but bluemsx emulator itself for some reason.\n\nI researched many articles and forums, and tried everything I can. I checked retroarch.cfg and see if there is problem on system directory setting, but it looks normal. I updated, deleted, reinstalled bluemsx, and updated retroarch, but nothing works.\n\nHere is my runcommand.log. (I just typed them all, since I don't know how to copy the log from retropie to the PC. Sorry.)\n\nparameters:\n\nExecuting: /opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/bin/retroarch -L /opt/retropie/libretrocores/lr-bluemsx/bluemsx_libretro.so --config /opt/retropie/configs/msx/retroarch.cfg \"/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/msx/Galaga (set 1).rom\" --appendconfig /dev/shm/retroarch.cfg\n\n/opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh: line 1006: 25490 Illegal instruction /opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/bin/retroarch -L /opt/retropie/libretrocores/lr-bluemsx/bluemsx_libretro.so --config /opt/retropie/configs/msx/retroarch.cfg \"/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/msx/Galaga (set 1).rom\" --appendconfig /dev/shm/retroarch.cfg\n\nIs the \"illegal instruction\" normally appears on runcommand.log like that?\n\nBecause someone mentioned that bluemsx core should be msx2 in core config, I checked the retroarch-core-options.cfg, but there is not a single line about bluemsx in the core option config file. I can see all other emulator setting in the core config including fmsx, but no bluemsx config in the file. Is this normal? or do I have a missing config?\n\nPlease help me to fix the problem. Thank you."
