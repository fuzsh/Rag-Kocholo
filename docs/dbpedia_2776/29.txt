The official Twitter page for Valis announced earlier today that the English digital edition of Valis The Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 is available now on the Nintendo Switch eShop.

It's an announcement that has seemingly come out of the blue, with the Japanese version of the game having launched all the way back in September of last year.

This collection contains the following games from the series: Valis IV (PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16), Syd of Valis (Mega Drive/Genesis), and Valis The Fantasm Soldier (Mega Drive/Genesis, MSX). It costs Â£37.69, with the games not yet being sold separately.

It's important to highlight that this has collection nothing to do with the Retro-Bit release we covered last October, but is instead a sequel to Edia's Valis: The Fantasm Soldier Collection released back in February of 2022 for Nintendo Switch. That Switch collection featured ports of the PC Engine versions of Valis The Fantasm Soldier, Valis II, and Valis III, and also came with modern additions like a rewind mode, sound mode, and visual mode.

Here's the description of the collection from the Nintendo eShop:

"Your adventure with Yuko is not over yet! The legendary bishojo action game series is back with its 2nd collection.

"The Valis: The Fantasm Soldier series began as a side-scrolling action game on Japanese PCs in 1986. These armor-clad gals captured the hearts of many fans throughout the years with extremely satisfying gameplay and unique worldbuilding that led to the creation of many sequels over the years that have been developed and ported across many console generations. Even now, 35 years after its debut, the Valis series still has many passionate fans all over the world."
