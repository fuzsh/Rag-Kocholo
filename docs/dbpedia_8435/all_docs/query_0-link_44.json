The place your study should be away from distractions, such as TV and in quite place where others in family don‟t sit and talk or move around. Make sure the lighting is good and table & chair are comfortable. Remove clutter (‫شور‬, ‫ )پریشانی‬a cluttered desk can make your mind cluttered too. So avoid having everything useless, all the books that you have ever used in school or college etc on the table. Just keep those book‟s you will need that day, according to what have you planed to study. Do not study on your bed because It is for relaxing and sleeping and that‟s the message yours brain gets if you sit and study on it. 2. Organize your study spot. Have everything you need to study with you. All books and stationeries should be within your reach. If you get up to something you will lose focus. 3. Turn it off. Turn off electronic devices like computers, cell phones etc. Only use your computer if you need it for your studies, otherwise you will be tempted to stray and start browsing. Even if it is for a few minutes, it will shift your focus away. Did you know that there are self restraint, self-control and think that can keep you away from the websites and software that are the difficult to resist. If you can block facebook, at least for a few hours not for days. 4. Clarify objectives. Know how much syllabus have to cover and in how much time, Go though out the exam syllabus and truthfully decide which subjects need more attention, may be because of the lengthy course or because it is difficult and requires a lot of learning. Then set objectives that should included how much time you will give to which subject, which topics you will do in which order and makes sure there is time for revision. Once you have set a clear goal, you will be in a better position to focus on it and attain it. 5. Tackle the difficult part first. Your power of concentration is higher in the beginning of your study session. Do the most critical and challenging topics and first then move on to the\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n18\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\neasier ones. If you do the easier tasks first, you will be thinking and stressing about the harder ones the whole time, reducing your productivity and ability to focus. Sometime the least desirable part of an assignment may be time consuming and it could drain/kill all your available time. So try to limit your time and selfsupervise to move on to easier matters, if absolutely necessary. 6. Break it up. Study for say one hour then take a five minute break. This will help your brain recharge. But don‟t over-do the brake. The brake can mean anything moving around, having a little snack, or just closing your eyes and relaxing. 7. Give in to temptation. You can your break in a useful way by giving in to the temptation that is really making you lose focus while studying. And by „temptation‟ I mean things like Facebook, messages, phone etc. just get it out of your system so that you can relax and get back to studying without your mind wondering if your friends messaged you or not. Let‟s be practical, social media and phone addition are really distracting and cannot be controlled in a day. So rather than wasting hours wondering about them while you should be focusing on learning check them out and kick out thoughts to concentrate on the next study session. Ultimately you‟ll be able to get more done. But this step should only be flowed when blocking yourself from these distractions. 8. Follow your body clock. There are certain times of the day when all of us are super-charged and when we are low. It‟s due to our body clock that has its own way of working and different people have different peak energy times. Some people learn best early in the morning and can‟t keep their eyes late in the night. Listen to your body and study during that time. 9. Sleep well. You need to have enough sleep each day. No concentration tips and tricks are going to work on a tired body and mind. 10. Eat well. If you eat healthy, your mind will be healthy too. Fruits, vegetables and dairy products will keep your energy level up and make you fit for any task.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n19\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nPAKISTAN SHORT HISTORY IDEOLOGY What is Ideology Science of ideas, visionary speculations, manner of thinking ,characteristic of a class or individual, ideas on the basis of some economic, social or political theory or system is called Ideology. It contains those ideals, which a nation strives to accomplish in order to bring stability to its nationhood. \"Ideology is a plan or program which is based upon philosphy\".(George Lewis) Ideology of Pakistan Pakistan is an Ideological state and the ideology of Pakistan is an Islamic ideology. Its basic princple being: \"The only sovereigner is Allah\". Islam acted as a nation building force before the establishment of Pakistan. Ideology of Pakistan basically means that Pakistan should be a state where the Muslims should have an opportunity to live according to the faith and creed based on the Islamic principles. They should have all the resources at the disposal to enhence Islamic culture and civilization. Quaid-e-Azam once said: \"Pakistan was created the day the first Indian national entered the field of Islam\". From the above statement, it is clear that Ideology of Pakistan is an Islamic state. Two Nation Concept The fundamental concept of Ideology is that Muslims should get a separate identity. They should have a separate state where they could live according to Islamic rules and principles, profess their religion freely and safeguard Islamic tradition .On one occasion Quaid-e-Azam said: \"The Muslims demand Pakistan where they can rule in accordance with their own system of life, their cultural development, their traditions and Islamic laws.\" Thus, this fundamental concept of Ideology led to the concept of two nations in the Sub Continent and resulted in the formation of Pakistan.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n20\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nPAKISTAN MOVEMENT Need for a Separate Homeland Hindus and Muslims had lived peacefully together in India for centuries but after the British invasion in South Asia and their undue support to Hindus life became very difficult for Indian Muslims. In fact, the Muslims were a separate nation who always adhered to their religious identity. The British and the Hindus in spite of their great efforts could not put a wedge into the Muslim unity and their love for the national character. The creation of Pakistan owes much to this feeling of adherence to their national image and religious identity.\n\nSome Factors Creating the Idea of a Separate Homeland 1. Desire to establish an Islamic State Islam is a complete code of life for the Muslims and they are eager to implement it in their personal and collective life. Islamic code of Life or Islamic Ideology cannot be implemented until a pure Islamic Society free from all other unIslamic influences is established. The desire to establish an Islamic State was also one of the factors to demand a separate homeland. 2. Two Nation Theory The Two Nation Theory played an important role for demanding a separate homeland according to which Hindus and Muslims are the two nations and therefore they cannot live together. Quaid-e-Azam once said, “Hindus and Muslims though living in the same towns and villages had never been blended into one nation. They were always two separate entities”. So the Muslims should have a separate State where they could lead their individual and collective life in accordance with the Islamic principles.\n\n3. Historical Collusion Hindu and Muslim historical collusion started when Muhammad Bin Qasim defeating Raja Dahir founded Islamic government in the subcontinent. Many battles were fought between Hindus and Muslims under Muslim Rule. The historical collusion continued also during the British Regime. Hindus, cooperating with British, tried to diminish Muslim culture and their way of life but they remained futile. The future of Muslims was obvious in such condition; therefore they decided to demand for the separate homeland. 4. Hindus and British Since the British snatched power from Muslims they were doubtful about the faithfulness of Muslims. So Hindus and British joined hands to destroy the\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n21\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nMuslims morally, socially, economically and politically. They reserved all higher civil, judicial and military appointments for British only while Muslims were debarred from all official positions. The Islamic educational system was replaced by British one. Then Muslims were forced to change their religion to Christianity and were compelled to send their children to co-educational institutes and abandon purdha. This was the reason that Muslims became fed up with both British and Hindus and decided to have a separate homeland. 5. British Parliamentary System Indian National Congress demanded the British Parliamentary system of government in India which meant majority rule. The implementation of this simply meant the Hindus slavery of Muslims since they were in majority. This was the reason that Muslims stressed on separate electorates and got it accepted. Separate electorate was the first brick in the foundation of demand for separate homeland. 6. Shuddi and Sangathan Movement Hindu Muslim Unity evaporated in the year after the Khilafat Movement and Hindu Muslim Riots began. The poison of differences between the two nations aggravated with the passage of time. The differences reached to the peak when Shuddhi and Sangathan movements began. The Shuddhi Movement aimed at the mass conversion of certain backward groups of Muslims into Hindus by force whereas the Sangathan Programme sought to organize the Hindus into a Militant force to flight with the Muslims. 7. Activities of Maha Sabha Maha Sabha was established in 1900. It was a non political party until the Shuddhi and Sangathan Movement started. These movements motivated Maha Sabha to be involved in politics. It proved to be the worst enemy of Muslims. The party declared Muslims as outsiders and said that Muslims have no relation with India. If they want to leave it then they could leave it happily but if they want to leave it then they could leave it happily but if they want to live in India, they will have to accept Hindu Mut. So it was impossible for Hindus and Muslims to live in a country together.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n22\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\n8. Protection of Urdu Language Urdu was considered to be the language of Muslims in the subcontinent. In 1867 the Hindu-Urdu controversy began with some outstanding Hindus of Banaras demanding replacements of Urdu by Hindi as the court language. The supporters of Hindi claimed for it a national status whereas the Muslims hotly denied it. As the controversy spread the two languages became more and more exclusive. Muslims got very disappointed when in April 1900 UP Governor Sir Antony Mac Donnell gave Hindi the status of National language with Urdu. That is why Muslims felt the need to set a political party. Then after a detailed discussion at last All India Muslim League was established in 1906. Maulvi Abdul Haque (1870-1961) has rightly said, Urdu Language placed the first brick in the foundation of Pakistan. It is a reality that it was one of the major reasons for demanding a separate country. 9. Protection of Muslim Culture Hindus with the consent of British during the Congress Ministries burnt and looted the properties and houses of Muslims. Moreover, the signs of Muslims past glory were damaged. Educational Syllabus was changed. Urdu was replaced by Hindi and the Muslim students were forced to worship statues of Gandhi in their schools. The Muslims of India, therefore, decided that the Muslim culture could be protected in a free and separate Muslim State. 10. Narrow mindedness of Hindus Hindu is a narrow-minded nation who does not believe the philosophy of equality. They considers themselves superior and used to call Muslims 'Maleech' (impure). There was no concept of eating and drinding together. Furthermore Muslims were not allowed to touch the food items of Hindus. There was only way out for the Muslims to demand a separate homeland. 11. Economic Hardships During the period of British Government, Hindus practically threw out Muslims from the fields of trade and industry. All the business, industrial and services opportunities were occupied by Hindus and some degraded jobs were left for the Muslims. Muslims of India became the political slave of British and economic slave of Hindus. To come out from this vicious circle at last Muslims decided to demand for a separate homeland.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n23\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\n12. Congress Ministries During the period of Congress Ministries (1937-1939). Hindus did worst possible injustice with Muslims. The Hindu-Muslim riots were usual during the Congress rule. Band-e-Mataram three coloured flag and statue of Gandhi were introduced at national level. Urdu was replaced by Hindi and slaughtering cow was banned. Muslim leaders showed their resentment before Gandhi and Jawahar Lal Nehru. Gandhi showed his helpless while Nehru plainly and openly said that there were only two nations in India. Congress and British and the rest should follow them. After this statement, nothing for left for Muslims but to present Pakistan Resolution in 1940. Role of Students in Pakistan Movement Muslim students played an important role in Pakistan Movement. The Modern Muslim Student is a post 1857 phenomenon. He is directly or indirectly a product of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan‟s movement for the promotion of modern education amongst the Muslims popularly known as the Aligarh movement. Aligarh students became the pace-setters in behaviour and dress for the rest of Muslim India. Young men from the Punjab, Bengal, Madras, Sindh, KP, UP, Bombay & Hyderabad lived for years at Aligarh as students under the same roof played on the same fields wore the same uniform and developed a remarkable homogeneity. The thus laid, unconsciously or conciously, the foundation of a nation which was to demand and get a homeland in later years. After the end of Khilafat movement, the political situation in the country was rapidly changing. The Role of Women in the Pakistan Movement The Muslim women played great role in the struggle for Pakistan. The great leaders from all over Sub-continent were in the fore front in fight for Pakistan and our women stood side by side with them. They went from house to house to raise funds for Pakistan Movement. They encouraged their men to make every sacrifice for attainment of Pakistan. They organized meetings and processions to attract the attention of world of their great cause. Role of Ulema in the Pakistan Movement Ulema and Mushaikh completely changed the atmosphere of subcontinent and charged their followers to sacrifice everything for the pious cause of the Pakistan\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n24\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nmovement. Without the struggle of Ulemas the ideological and spiritual support would be weakened and religious and social regeneration of Muslim society, which provided the cementing force to the idea of Pakistan would miss. Undoubtedly the dream of Pakistan would not be realized if Ulemas, Mushaiks and reformist did not play their due role. Ex. Maulana Mahmudul Hasan, Maulana Hasrat Mohani, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Maulana Husain Ahmed Madani, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Ulemas like Pir Jamat Ali Shah declared Quaid -e- Azam “Waliullah” fighting for the right cause. Muslims of India could not be prepared for such a big revolution without the effort of the Ulemas. The Establishment of Pakistan (August 14, 1947) Pakistan emerged on the map of the world as an independent state on August 14, 1947. Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province, Kashmir, and Bengal. The areas with the Muslim majority formed Pakistan while the provinces and states with Hindu majority called India. The British transferred the power to the Indians and Pakistanis. A massive migration of 14.5 million people from both sides took place on this occasion because India was divided into two parts on the basis of Hinduism and Islam. 7,226,000 Muslims while7, 249,000 Hindus and Sikhs crossed the borders. As soon as the Division of India was announced by the British on June 3rd 1947. The so-called Hindu claims of being on good terms with Muslims were unfurled. In August 1947 they came at cross purposes with the Muslims overnight and started a “Holi of Blood” against the division of Maha Bharat, the counterpart of the “Mother Cow”. The dynamite of 1000 years‟ hatred against the Muslims exploded and a massive number of Muslims was martyred in their homes, streets and areas. Muslims were followed on the ways to Pakistan. The ladies were kidnapped, dishonored and succumbed to death for the penalty of being Muslims. The biggest migration of the world took place on bullock carts, trains and on foot. The nights facilitated the torturous journey to Pakistan when the days became the fanatic murderers of “Muslaaz” and “Musleez”. The Hindus and Sikhs ambushed to murder the people with whom they used to live for centuries.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n25\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nInitial Problems of Pakistan The emergence of Pakistan, after a long and ardous freedom movement, was infact a great victory of the democratic idea of life. The Indian Muslims happily and valiantly laid down their lives and properties to achieve a destination in which they saw the fulfillment of their dreams of living an independent life free from Hindu or British dominance.Quaid-e-Azam on 15th August ,1947 said: \"My thoughts are with those valiant fighters in our cause who readily sacrificed all they had including their lives to make Pakistan possible.\" 1.Choice of Capital The first problem that Pakistan had to face was to choose a capital to form a Government and to establish a secretariat. Karachi was chosen as the capital of Pakistan.Quaid-e-Azam took the office of the Governor General Liaqat Ali Khan was appointed as Prime Minister and a Cabinet of experienced persons was selected. Arrangements were to be made to bring the officials who had opted for Pakistan from Delhi to Karachi. 2.Unfair Boundary Distrbution A boundry commission was set up under a British Chairman,Sir Cyril Redcliff.He misused his powers and handed over Muslim majority areas like Gurdaspur,Ferozpur and Jullander to India hence providing them a gateway to Kashmir.Quaid-e-Azam called it: \" An unjust, incomprehensible and even perverse award.\" 3.The Massacre of Muslim Refugees in India On the birth of Pakistan Hindus and Sikhs became more furious. In a planned move Muslim properties were set on fire and they were compelled to leave Bharat for Pakistan with nothing but their lives. Millions of refugees were killed before they reached Pakistan. Many migrants were looted and had to be provided boarding immediately as they reached Pakistan. 4.Division of Military and Finantial Assets In order to embarrass Pakistan financially. India did a lot of dishonesty in the matters of Pakistan which were concerned with its benefits.Pakistan was promised to get Rs.750 million but the Bharat Government refused to give. Pakistan received only 200 million. Pakistan also did not receive the due share of the military assets. This dishonest attitude put Pakistan into great difficulties.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n26\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\n5.Canal Water Dispute Most of the river flowing in Pakistan have their origin in India. In 1948 India stopped water supply to Pakistani canals to damage the Pakistani agriculture.However on 9th September 1960 on agreement called \"Indus Basin Treaty\" was signed between the two countries. 6. Kashmir Dispute Kashmir dispute is the most important and unsolved problem. Kashmir is the natural part of Pakistan becaouse at the time of partition 85% of the Kashmir's total population was Muslim. The Hindu dogra rule, who was secretly with the Govenment of India declared Kashmir as a part of India. Pakistan has continously insisted that Kashmir must get their right of self determination but due to non-coperation of India, Kashmir issue still remain unsolved. 7.Constitutional Problem The constituent assembly failed to frame a constitution even in eight years. Lack of a permanent constitution created, chances of unscrupulous interference in democratic progress of Pakistan. 8.Annexation of Princely States All Indian princely states were given the right to link up with either of dominions. However, the fate of following states remained undecided. Junagadh The Muslim Nawab governing junagadh favoured in acceding to Pakistan. But Indian Government sent Army troops towards Junagadh and occupied the state by force in November,1947. Hyderabad Deccan Hyderabad Deccan was the largest and richest state ruled by Muslim ruler Nizam who decided to remain independent. But pressure tactics began to be applied by Indian Government and Mount Batten .India attacked Hyderabad on 13th September 1948 and forcibly annexed this state to India. 9.Electrcity Problem Due to transfer of Muslim majority areas to Bharat and unfair demarcation, electricity system of West Punjab was disrupted, because all power stations were at Mundi a predominantly Muslim majority area, gifted to Bharat but Quiad-eAzam said:\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n27\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\n\"If we are to exist as a nation, we will have to face the problems with determination and force.\" Pakistan came into being as a free Muslim state in quite unfavourable circumstances .It had no resources, it had to build up its administrative machinery from a scratch. But Supreme efforts were made by the Quiad-e-Azam and his colleagues to grapple with the situation. His golden principles \"Unity\" \"Faith\" and \"Discipline\" gave way to Pakistan for a bright future of a strong and well developed country. In his last message to the nation on 14th August 1948, he told the nation: \"The foundation of your state have been laid and it is now for you to build and build as quickly and as you can.\"\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah Mohammed Ali Jinnah was born on 25 December 1876 in Karachi, now in Pakistan, but then part of British-controlled India. His father was a prosperous Muslim merchant. Jinnah studied at Bombay University and at Lincoln's Inn in London. He then ran a successful legal practice in Bombay. He was already a member of the Indian National Congress, which was working for autonomy from British rule, when he joined the Muslim League in 1913. The league had formed a few years earlier to represent the interests of Indian Muslims in a predominantly Hindu country and by 1916 he was elected its president. In 1920, the Indian National Congress launched a movement of non-cooperation to boycott all aspects of British rule. Jinnah opposed this policy and resigned from the congress. There were by now profound differences between the congress and the Muslim League. After provincial elections in 1937 the congress refused to form coalition administrations with the Muslim League in mixed areas. Relations between Hindus and Muslims began to deteriorate. In 1940, at a Muslim League session in Lahore, the first official demand was made for the partition of India and the creation of a Muslim state of Pakistan. Jinnah had always believed that HinduMuslim unity was possible, but reluctantly came to the view that partition was necessary to safeguard the rights of Indian Muslims.\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n28\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nHis insistence on this issue through negotiations with the British government resulted in the partition of India and the formation of the state of Pakistan on 14 August 1947. This occurred against a backdrop of widespread violence between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, and a vast movement of populations between the new states of Pakistan and India in which hundreds of thousands died. Jinnah became the first governor general of Pakistan, but died of tuberculosis on 11 September 1948.\n\nDr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal Poet of the east Allama Muhammad Iqbal was born on 9th November 1877 in Sialkot.

But the Muslim state proposed by him came into being on 14th August 1947.\n\nSir Syed Ahmed Khan Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was born in Delhi on 17th October 1817. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was a great reformer.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan knew that the Muslims could not achieve this goal without education. He set up a Persian school at Muradabad in 1859. This school was upgraded to the college in 1875. This college was upgraded to the college and the university level after his death. The educated Muslims of the early twentieth century were the product of this institution. He urged the Muslims to acquire knowledge first and then they should take part in the politics of the subcontinent. After the war of independence, his position was not less than that of a great political reformer for Muslims. Aligarh Movement had the following objectives: 1. To build confidence between the British and the Muslims. 2. To persuade the Muslims to get scientific knowledge and learn English language. 3. To hold back the Muslims from the collective politics. His main focus was on Aligarh to achieve his goals. He established Mohammadan Anglo Oriental School. It was a symbol of a broad movement affecting every phase of Muslim life. The actions taken by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for the educational uplift of the Muslims left a far-reaching impact on the political, social, economic and religious aspects of the Muslims. The Aligarh movement showed new ways to press and opened the doors of economic prosperity for the Muslims of the sub-continent. Congress and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan In 1883, Lord A.O. Hume formed an organization called Indian National Congress. The aim of this party was to provide a political platform for the Indians. Many Indians joined this party. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was an open minded and large hearted person. He was a great patriot at first he considered all who lived in India as one nation and was a great advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity. He looked both Hindus and Muslims with the same eyes. He said, “By the word “Nation”, I mean only Hindus and Muslims and nothing else. Our interests and problems are common and therefore, I consider the two factions as one nation.” But unfortunately the attitude of Hindus and Congress compelled him to reconsider his ideas about one nation. He felt sorry to see that both Congress and\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n30\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nHindus looking against the interests of the Muslims. Congress ignored the Muslims totally. He failed to bring Hundus and Muslims closer on a single platform. He saw that the Hindus never come forward with open mind and always adopted a policy to damage the Muslim cause, so Sir Syed Ahmed Khan advised the Muslims to keep themselves away from it. On 1st October 1906 Sir Agha Khan led a Muslim delegation and met the Viceroy Lord Minto at Simla to demand a separate electorate for Muslims in the coming reforms. The viceroy save a good response to them. There being no political party for Muslims at that time a strong need for it was felt. God Almightly enabled them to form Muslim League.

He was born in 1878 in Rampur, India. He belonged to the Yousafzai, tribe of Pashtoons. Despite the early death of his father, the efforts, determination and sacrifice by his farsighted mother Abadi Bano Begum enabled him and his brothers to get good education. Their mother mortgaged almost all her landed property and sent them to the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Aligarh. Both of the Ali Brothers graduated from this College. Mohammad Ali showed exceptional brilliance throughout his College career and stood first in the B.A. examination of the Allahabad University, later in 1898 Mohammad Ali proceeded to Lincoln College, Oxford for further studies where he got honors degree in Modern History and devoted himself more to the study of history of Islam. After his return to India. He took charge as education director for the Rampur state and later for almost a decade served in the Baroda civil service. He possessed remarkable brilliance as a writer. He wrote articles in various newspapers like “The Times”, “The Observer” and “The Manchester Guardian” as well as other major English and Indian newspapers in both English and Urdu. He was man of a versatile genius and played a great part in the endeavors against\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n34\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\nthe British colonial rule. He was a great orator and still greater Journalist. He became firm opponents of British rule under the combined shock of the Balkan wars and Kanpur Mosque incident in 1913. His relentless determination and ardor in the cause of India‟s freedom, and his persistence in pursuing the goal most dear to him won him the respect and affection of his numerous countrymen. He launched his famous weekly The Comrade, in English, from Calcutta, on January 14, 1911, written and edited by one man and produced on expensive paper, The Comrade quickly gained circulation and influence. After twenty months the paper moved to Delhi the then new capital of British Empire. Later in 1913 he started publishing an Urdu-language daily Hamdard as well. Mohammad Ali worked hard to expand the Aligarh Muslim University then known as the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College and was one of the cofounders of the Jamia Millia Islamia in 1920, which was later moved to Delhi. Jauhar was among the founders of All India Muslim League and attended first meeting in Dhaka in 1906. He served as its president in 1918 and remained active in the League till 1928. Being a Muslim and passionate believer of caliphate he played active role in Khilafat movement. He represented the Muslim delegation that travelled to England in 1919 to persuade the British government to influence the Turkish Mustafa Kamal not to depose the Sultan of Turkey, who was the Caliph of Islam. British rejection of their demands resulted in the formation of the Khilafat committee which directed Muslims all over India to protest and boycott the government. In 1921, M. Ali formed a broad coalition with Muslim nationalists like Shaukat Ali, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari and Indian nationalist leader Mahatama Gandhi, who enlisted the support of the Indian National Congress and many thousands of Hindus who joined the Muslims in a demonstration of unity. He wholeheartedly supported Gandhi‟s call for a national civil resistance movement and inspired many hundreds of protests and strikes all over India. He was arrested by British authorities and imprisoned for two years for what was termed as a seditious speech at the meeting of the Khilafat Conference. He was the sixth Muslim to become the President of Indian National Congress in 1923. Mohammed Ali‟s elevation to the Congress president ship helped to legitimize his position in nationalist circles but within months he began to drift away from congress. This had a great deal to do with\n\nEver Success - General Knowledge\n\n35\n\nSaad Book Bank, Lahore\n\ndeteriorating Hindu-Muslim relations and the Congress inclination towards the communal forces of Hindu Mahasabha. Mohammad Ali‟s anxieties were heightened by the growing fissures in the Hindu-Muslim alliance in Bengal and Punjab and the rapid progress of the Arya Samaj, the Hindu Mahasabha, the shuddhi and sangathan. The publication of the Nehru report in August 1928 proved the last nail in the coffin of Hindu Muslim unity. Mohammed Ali pleaded Muslims to send a separate delegation in 1930s London Round Table Conference to represent Muslims. His appeal symbolized the collapse of the old alliance on which Gandhi had built the non-cooperation movement and clearly showed that only Muslim League spoke for the Indian Muslims. Although seriously ill he joined the delegation led by the Aga Khan with the firm conviction that critical collaboration with the British at the Round Table Conference would bring greater political benefits. His speech at the Round Table Conference, which turned out to be his last sermon appeared to be the last wish of dying man. „I want to go back to my country, „Mohammed Ali declared, „with the substance of freedom in my hand. Otherwise I will not go back to a slave country. I would even prefer to die in a foreign country so long as it is a free country and if you do not give me freedom in India you will have to give me a grave here.‟ Mohammed Ali a chronic patient of diabetes died soon after the conference in London on January 4, 1931 in London and was buried in Jerusalem in the court-yard of Masjid-ul-Aqsa.\n\nMaulana Shaukat Ali Both brothers Shaukat Ali and Muhammad Ali were among the architects of Pakistan‟s freedom.

In that situation he stands for the betterment of Muslims not only Muslims of sub-continent he had soft corner in his heart for Muslims all over the world. He worked for the unity of Muslims of subcontinent and the world. He was among the first ones who brought political awareness in not only Hyderabad but also worked hard for political awareness in other Muslim majority areas of subcontinent.

He was a religious person and want Muslims and Islam stability in India and all over the world. As a part of Hyderabad state Bahadur Yar Jung wasn‟t theoretically allowed to join any political party. But he voluntarily worked for Muslim league. He was both emotionally and practically attached with Muslim League. Major reason of joining Muslim League was his emotional attachment to Mohammad Ali Jinnah and purpose to get a separate homeland for Muslims. Sudden death of Bahadur Yar Jung in 1944 was a great loss of Muslims. His enigmatic death is still a mystery. If he endured the outcome of Pakistan would be different today.\n\nSARDAR ABDUR RAB NISHTAR Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar was born on June 13, 1899 at Peshawar and belonged to Kakar tribe.
