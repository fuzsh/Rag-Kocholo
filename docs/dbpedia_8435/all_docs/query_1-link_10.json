The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 659,396. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 8,093 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Malawi to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of Malawi population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n2,310 live births average per day (96.26 in an hour)\n\n504 deaths average per day (20.98 in an hour)\n\n-22 emigrants average per day (-0.92 in an hour)\n\nThe population of Malawi will be increasing by 1,784 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of Malawi 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of Malawi was estimated to be 21,298,322 people. This is an increase of 3.06 % (631,977 people) compared to population of 20,666,345 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 639,830. Due to external migration, the population declined by 7,853. The sex ratio of the total population was 1.002 (1,002 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for Malawi population in 2023:\n\n818,181 live births\n\n178,351 deaths\n\nNatural increase: 639,830 people\n\nNet migration: -7,853 people\n\n10,662,137 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n10,636,185 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nMalawi population density\n\nMalawi population density is 179.8 people per square kilometer (465.6/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Malawi divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Malawi. The total area of Malawi is 118,480 km2 (45,745 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in Malawi\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Christianity17,977,72382.8 %Islam2,822,58913.0 %Religiously Unaffiliated542,8062.5 %Folk or traditional religions369,1081.7 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Tuesday, August 20 2024).\n\nMalawi age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Malawi had the following population age distribution:\n\n45.1 52.2 2.7\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n9,600,858 young people under 15 years old ( 4,810,652 males / 4,789,993 females)\n\n11,127,095 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 5,553,963 males / 5,572,919 females)\n\n570,582 persons above 64 years old ( 244,505 males / 326,077 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the Malawi population pyramid has an expanding type. This type of pyramid is common for developing countries with high birth and death rates. Relatively short life expectancy, as well as low level of education and poor health care are also describe such kind of population age distribution model.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Malawi age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in Malawi is 91.4 %.\n\nAs we can see the dependent part of population is comparable to the working part. It means that each working person in Malawi must provide goods for himself and cover expenditure on one child or aged person additionally. The value of 91.4 % shows that the pressure on productive population in Malawi is very high.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in Malawi is 86.3 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in Malawi is 5.1 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Malawi age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Malawi is 51.7 years.\n\nThis is below the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 50.9 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 52.5 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 7,691,120 persons or 65.75% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Malawi are able to read and write. Accordingly about 4,006,344 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 72.99% (4,232,244 persons). 1,566,224 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 58.64% (3,458,876 persons). 2,440,120 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 74.92% and 75.2% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 75.06%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Malawi population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nMalawi population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 19512,983,068N/A %19523,042,2531.98 %19533,104,2982.04 %19543,168,9772.08 %19553,236,4162.13 %19563,306,5952.17 %19573,379,8982.22 %19583,456,1282.26 %19593,535,5092.30 %19603,618,0532.33 %19613,704,2302.38 %19623,793,7782.42 %19633,886,8702.45 %19643,983,4082.48 %19654,083,8342.52 %19664,187,8822.55 %19674,295,8952.58 %19684,407,7532.60 %19694,523,7962.63 %19704,643,4902.65 %19714,766,9522.66 %19724,894,1782.67 %19735,026,5162.70 %19745,164,8032.75 %19755,310,5512.82 %19765,465,6652.92 %19775,632,5123.05 %19785,808,1443.12 %19795,986,9093.08 %19806,163,4382.95 %19816,332,0732.74 %19826,489,8142.49 %19836,652,6612.51 %19846,851,8882.99 %19857,117,6903.88 %19867,468,9674.94 %19877,905,7165.85 %19888,390,2676.13 %19898,857,9315.57 %19909,241,3854.33 %19919,503,2352.83 %19929,643,4011.47 %19939,698,2550.57 %19949,728,1600.31 %19959,795,4620.69 %19969,934,0881.42 %199710,144,8402.12 %199810,409,8072.61 %199910,704,5762.83 %200011,002,3422.78 %200111,291,5402.63 %200211,573,9902.50 %200311,858,1002.45 %200412,151,8342.48 %200512,465,2252.58 %200612,801,2512.70 %200713,159,2632.80 %200813,535,9082.86 %200913,929,6752.91 %201014,335,5762.91 %201114,752,6002.91 %201215,180,2492.90 %201315,619,4702.89 %201416,066,2692.86 %201516,519,3002.82 %201616,976,5362.77 %201717,439,6342.73 %201817,908,6482.69 %201918,387,9772.68 %202018,880,7212.68 %202119,458,0933.06 %202220,053,1213.06 %202320,666,3453.06 %202421,298,3223.06 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
