        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nEstablished in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA, the country held multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year. Bakili MULUZI became the first freely elected president of Malawi when he won the presidency in 1994; he won re-election in 1999. President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party in 2005. MUTHARIKA was reelected to a second term in 2009. He oversaw some economic improvement in his first term, but was accused of economic mismanagement and poor governance in his second term. He died abruptly in 2012 and was succeeded by vice president, Joyce BANDA, who had earlier started her own party, the People's Party. MUTHARIKA's brother, Peter MUTHARIKA, defeated BANDA in the 2014 election. Population growth, increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthern Africa, east of Zambia, west and north of Mozambique\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n13 30 S, 34 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 118,484 sq km\n\nland: 94,080 sq km\n\nwater: 24,404 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 101\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Pennsylvania\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 2,857 km\n\nborder countries (3): Mozambique 1498 km, Tanzania 512 km, Zambia 847 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nsub-tropical; rainy season (November to May); dry season (May to November)\n\nTerrain\n\nnarrow elongated plateau with rolling plains, rounded hills, some mountains\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 779 m\n\nlowest point: junction of the Shire River and international boundary with Mozambique 37 m\n\nhighest point: Sapitwa (Mount Mlanje) 3,002 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nlimestone, arable land, hydropower, unexploited deposits of uranium, coal, and bauxite\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 59.2% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 38.2% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 1.4% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 19.6% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 34% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 6.8% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n740 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation density is highest south of Lake Nyasa\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflooding; droughts; earthquakes\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\ndeforestation; land degradation; water pollution from agricultural runoff, sewage, industrial wastes; siltation of spawning grounds endangers fish populations; negative effects of climate change (extreme high temperatures, changing precipatation pattens)\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: Law of the Sea\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; Lake Nyasa, some 580 km long, is the country's most prominent physical feature; it contains more fish species than any other lake on earth\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n19,842,560 (July 2018 est.)\n\nnote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 60\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Malawian(s)\n\nadjective: Malawian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nChewa 34.3%, Lomwe 18.8%, Yao 13.2%, Ngoni 10.4%, Tumbuka 9.2%, Sena 3.8%, Mang'anja 3.2%, Tonga 1.8%, Nyanja 1.8%, Nkhonde 1%, other 2.2%, foreign .3% (2018 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nEnglish (official), Chichewa (common), Chinyanja, Chiyao, Chitumbuka, Chilomwe, Chinkhonde, Chingoni, Chisena, Chitonga, Chinyakyusa, Chilambya\n\nReligions\n\nProtestant 33.5% (includes Church of Central Africa Presbyterian 14.2%, Seventh Day Adventist/Baptist 9.4%, Pentecostal 7.6%, Anglican 2.3%), Roman Catholic 17.2%, other Christian 26.6%, Muslim 13.8%, traditionalist 1.1%, other 5.6%, none 2.1% (2018 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nMalawi has made great improvements in maternal and child health, but has made less progress in reducing its high fertility rate. In both rural and urban areas, very high proportions of mothers are receiving prenatal care and skilled birth assistance, and most children are being vaccinated. Malawi’s fertility rate, however, has only declined slowly, decreasing from more than 7 children per woman in the 1980s to about 5.5 today. Nonetheless, Malawians prefer smaller families than in the past, and women are increasingly using contraceptives to prevent or space pregnancies. Rapid population growth and high population density is putting pressure on Malawi’s land, water, and forest resources. Reduced plot sizes and increasing vulnerability to climate change, further threaten the sustainability of Malawi’s agriculturally based economy and will worsen food shortages. About 80% of the population is employed in agriculture.Historically, Malawians migrated abroad in search of work, primarily to South Africa and present-day Zimbabwe, but international migration became uncommon after the 1970s, and most migration in recent years has been internal. During the colonial period, Malawians regularly migrated to southern Africa as contract farm laborers, miners, and domestic servants. In the decade and a half after independence in 1964, the Malawian Government sought to transform its economy from one dependent on small-scale farms to one based on estate agriculture. The resulting demand for wage labor induced more than 300,000 Malawians to return home between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s. In recent times, internal migration has generally been local, motivated more by marriage than economic reasons.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 46.17%(male 4,560,940 /female 4,600,184)\n\n15-24 years: 20.58%(male 2,023,182 /female 2,059,765)\n\n25-54 years: 27.57%(male 2,717,613 /female 2,752,983)\n\n55-64 years: 3%(male 284,187 /female 310,393)\n\n65 years and over: 2.69%(male 234,776 /female 298,537) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 91 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 85.3 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.7 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 17.4 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 16.6 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 16.5 years\n\nfemale: 16.8 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 223\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n3.31% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 3\n\nBirth rate\n\n40.7 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 8\n\nDeath rate\n\n7.7 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 100\n\nNet migration rate\n\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 91\n\nPopulation distribution\n\npopulation density is highest south of Lake Nyasa\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 17.2% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 4.19% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n1.075 million LILONGWE (capital), 905,000 Blantyre-Limbe (2019)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 0.92 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.79 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2018 est.)\n\nMother's mean age at first birth\n\n18.9 years (2015/16 est.)\n\nnote: median age at first birth among women 25-29\n\nMaternal mortality rate\n\n349 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 31\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 42.1 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 48.6 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 35.5 deaths/1,000 live births\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 42\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 62.2 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 60.2 years\n\nfemale: 64.3 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 200\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n5.43 children born/woman (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 9\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n59.2% (2015/16)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 95.7% of population\n\nrural: 89.1% of population\n\ntotal: 90.2% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 4.3% of population\n\nrural: 10.9% of population\n\ntotal: 9.8% of population (2015 est.)\n\nCurrent Health Expenditure\n\n9.8% (2016)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.02 physicians/1,000 population (2016)\n\nHospital bed density\n\n1.3 beds/1,000 population (2011)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 47.3% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 39.8% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 41% of population (2015 est.)\n\nunimproved: urban: 52.7% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 60.2% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 59% of population (2015 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n9.2% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 9\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS\n\n1 million (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 10\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths\n\n13,000 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 18\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\ndegree of risk: very high (2016)\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (2016)\n\nvectorborne diseases: malaria and dengue fever (2016)\n\nwater contact diseases: schistosomiasis (2016)\n\nanimal contact diseases: rabies (2016)\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n5.8% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 173\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n11.8% (2015)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 56\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n4% of GDP (2017)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 104\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 62.1%\n\nmale: 69.8%\n\nfemale: 55.2% (2015)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 11 years\n\nmale: 11 years\n\nfemale: 11 years (2011)\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\n\ntotal: 8.5%\n\nmale: 6.7%\n\nfemale: 10.6% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 140\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: Republic of Malawi\n\nconventional short form: Malawi\n\nlocal long form: Dziko la Malawi\n\nlocal short form: Malawi\n\nformer: British Central African Protectorate, Nyasaland Protectorate, Nyasaland\n\netymology: named for the East African Maravi Kingdom of the 16th century;

The country’s economic performance has historically been constrained by policy inconsistency, macroeconomic instability, poor infrastructure, rampant corruption, high population growth, and poor health and education outcomes that limit labor productivity. The economy is predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about one-third of GDP and 80% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of exports, although Malawi is looking to diversify away from tobacco to other cash crops.The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. Donors halted direct budget support from 2013 to 2016 because of concerns about corruption and fiscal carelessness, but the World Bank resumed budget support in May 2017. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program but recent increases in domestic borrowing mean that debt servicing in 2016 exceeded the levels prior to HIPC debt relief.Heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, with corn being the staple crop, Malawi’s economy was hit hard by the El Nino-driven drought in 2015 and 2016, and now faces threat from the fall armyworm. The drought also slowed economic activity, led to two consecutive years of declining economic growth, and contributed to high inflation rates. Depressed food prices over 2017 led to a significant drop in inflation (from an average of 21.7% in 2016 to 12.3% in 2017), with a similar drop in interest rates.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$22.42 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$21.56 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$21.08 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 145\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$6.24 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n4% (2017 est.)\n\n2.3% (2016 est.)\n\n3% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 79\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$1,200 (2017 est.)\n\n$1,200 (2016 est.)\n\n$1,200 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 223\n\nGross national saving\n\n3.9% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n-2.8% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n2.8% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 178\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 84.3% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 16.3% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 15.3% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 27.9% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -43.8% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 28.6% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 15.4% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 56% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ntobacco, sugarcane, tea, corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava (manioc, tapioca), sorghum, pulses, cotton, groundnuts, macadamia nuts, coffee;
