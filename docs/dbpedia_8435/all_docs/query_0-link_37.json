SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE WITNESSES JAMES R. LYONS, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE PAUL W. JOHNSON, CHIEF, SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE PEARLIE S. REED, ASSOCIATE CHIEF GARY A- MARGHEIM, DEPUTY CHIEF FOR PROGRAMS MANLY S. WILDER, DEPUTY CHIEF FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND BUDGET ANALYSIS JUDITH C. PALENSKY, DIRECTOR, BUDGET PLANNING AND ANALYSIS DIVISION STEPHEN B. DEWHURST, BUDGET OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF AGRI- CULTURE Mr. DURBIN. Grood morning. This morning we're considering the budget for the Soil Conservation Service for fiscal year 1995. We are pleased to be joined by James Lyons, who is the Assistant Sec- retary for Natural Resources and Environment, Paul Johnson, Chief of the Soil Conservation Service, Pearlie S. Reed, Associate Chief, Gary A. Margheim, who is Deputy Chief of Programs, Manly Wilder, Deputy Chief for Strategic Planning and Budget Analysis, Judith Palensky, Director of Budget Planning and Analysis, and our friend, Steve Dewhurst. Mr. Lyons, we have your statement for the record. We invite you now to highlight it and tell us a little bit about your needs for next year. Opening Remarks by Assistant Secretary Mr. Lyons. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of Secretary Espy, I want to thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the fiscal year 1995 request for the Soil Conservation Service. I have been on board almost a year now as the Assistant Sec- retary for Natural Resources and Environment, and I will admit this is my first experience and exposure to the administrative budget process. I've had the pleasure of working with the sub- committee members before in my capacity as staff to the House Ag- riculture Committee, working with Chairman de la Garza. It's very different downtown, I can assure you, and I know you are aware of that. (1) You have my written remarks, so I will not go into matters in great detail. My real purpose in being here this morning, Mr. Chairman, is to introduce Paul Johnson, who is the new Chief of the Soil Conservation Service. We are excited about having Paul on board, heading up our con- servation efforts as a part of the Secretary's natural resources team. Paul's background is that of an Iowa fsirmer, a forester, and a former state legislator. He is very active in a number of issues particularly related to water quality and the Iowa landmark groundwater protection bill. He's been a leader in agricultural conservation for a number of years, and we're confident he'll continue to show that leadership at the helm of the Soil Conservation Service. He is joined by Pearlie Reed, who was formerly the state con- servationist from California. Pearlie has broad experience and brings to the team a wealth of information and understanding about the organization itself. I think between the two of them, we have a very effective leadership team. Before I turn to Paul, I would like to highlight a few of the issues and concerns we have with regard to the budget. BUDGET ISSUES AND CONCERNS First, I would say that the budget reflects the Administration's commitment to fiscal responsibility in government, and an attempt to address, of course, the budget deficit concerns. I know you've heard that many times before. However, we have made a sincere commitment to try and estab- lish priorities in a way that will allow us to achieve our primary conservation goals while addressing these budget deficit concerns. There are successful and important programs we recognize with- in the budget that had to be reduced in size if we were to meet our budget deficit targets. We had to make some tough choices, and I know we will have a chance to discuss those this morning. We believe the process that led to the hard choices we had to make in the present Soil Conservation Service budget could be im- proved, but to do so, we need your help. We look forward to work- ing with you and your staff in developing this budget, and perhaps also worMng towards a new approach to developing the fiscal year 1996 request. There are many competing demands for services and assistance from the Soil Conservation Service, and we must go through a ra- tional process for examining these needs and trying to balance them with funds to pay for them. We will work with our employees, our customers and our con- stituencies to try and achieve these objectives. This is in fact what we've done in developing this important budget. You will see, Mr. Chairman, that we have placed priority in a number of areas. We have an impending deadline for completion of the conservation compliance plans at the end of this year. We are investing resources in our conservation operations program to try and achieve that goal, and to try and provide complete service to those farmers who have to complete their conservation plans by that time. We are also placing high priority on addressing water quality concerns. That is reflected in a number of areas. It also is reflected in the budget of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, particularly in investments in the Wetlands Reserve Pro- gram. I know that you have had some discussions with the folks from ASCS already. You are aware that the Secretary has presented a proposal for USDA reorganization. As a part of that proposal, we would seek to fold the conservation cost-share programs of the ASCS' into a new agency we call the Natural Resources Conservation Service. I know there has been a great deal of controversy about that. There's been a subcommittee mark-up by Chairman Stenholm here in the House. Yesterday, Senator Leahy marked up his reorganiza- tion bill, over at the Senate. I would point out that our efforts in this regard are to try and provide as efficient and effective service as we can to all the con- stituencies who seek conservation services from USDA. Our ultimate goal is to provide the conservationists with all the tools necessary to do the job on the ground. We feel this kind of reorganization is the best way to get at it. I would make one further point before I turn things over to Paul, Mr. Chairman. We are serious about trying to improve the effi- ciency of our operations and the effectiveness of our service deliv- ery system. In that vein, we are about to launch our own review and reinvention effort as a means of assessing what kind of Natural Re- source Conservation Service we need, what kind of structure, per- sonnel and resources are necessary to meet not only the challenges that remain in this century, but those that well face as we enter the next century. This process will be a broad process. We will work closely with our sister agencies as well as with the public. We look forward to working with you and your staff as we conduct this assessment and begin the process of restructuring our organization to deal with those conservation challenges we face down the road. Thank you very much. Mr. DURBIN. Thanks, Mr. Lyons. Mr. Johnson? Statement by SCS Chief Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the fiscal year 1995 budget request for the Soil Conservation Serv- ice. I would add at the start that I have been on this job for two months, and because of that, I don't pretend to know all the tech- nical ins and outs of this, but I brought some very good people along with me, and together I think we will do our best to answer your questions. We look forward to working with you as we move ahead to define an agenda for conservation in the context of today's economic and environmental challenges. Our current concerns are centered around the highly erodible land conservation program, wetlands, reorganization, and the Midwest flood relief efforts. 1985 FARM BILL The end of this year is a milestone in the process established in the 1985 Farm Bill, and farmers are expected to have their con- servation plans in place at the end of this point. We expect that the vast majority of farmers will have met this challenge, and will be well-positioned to carry on with this success in the years to come. Current status reviews show that over 90 percent of the farmers will have their plans in place. As the national average, erosion rates on a highly erodible land will be down to six tons per acre compared with 17 tons per acre before we started. I think this is a major accomplishment, and something that all of agriculture can be very proud of. Beyond 1994, farmers are expected by law to continue their con- servation work, and we will continue to make it our priority to help farmers meet this challenge. WETLANDS In regards to wetlands, SCS has been given major new respon- sibilities for the delineation of wetlands on agricultural land. We take this responsibility very seriously in terms of the opportunity we now have to reduce the confusion producers have experienced in confronting this issue, and also to insure our improved effective- ness in protecting these important resources. I have put together a special team to oversee this effort. They are presently staffing up, both in Washington and across the nation, to deal with the wetlands issues. The 1995 budget includes an increase of $15.6 million, and 265 staff years to help with this workload. The budget also incorporates a number of initiatives related to USDA reorganization and streamlining plans. First and foremost of these is the consolidation of USDA con- servation programs under the new Natural Resources Conservation Service. I would like to emphasize that our plans to seek broad-based input into the development of our plans for renewing the Soil Con- servation Service from our employees, our customers, our partners, and those with an interest in the conservation mission of this de- partment, including those who don't always agree with us. In that, I think it is very, very important if we're going to get conservation on the land that all people who are affected by it are involved in that process. We want to do the best possible job of enhancing our ability to deliver services at the field level. We will do this by building on the strengths our people and our programs already have, and I believe they are considerable. This will be a long-term initiative. MIDWEST FLOOD RELIEF Finally, I would mention briefly the ongoing Midwest flood relief effort. Over 40 percent of these projects eligible for our assistance in the nine states that are impacted by this disaster are either completed or under contract. The recently-enacted supplemental would give us the opportunity to move ahead to meet other needs, including additional enroll- ments in the Emergency Wetland Reserve Program, and repairs of large agricultural levees. We will keep the Committee informed of progress in this effort. 1995 SCS BUDGET REQUEST In summarizing our 1995 budget request, there have been some decisions in terms of our program priorities. The budget request for these programs traditionally administered by SCS is $726 million, a net mnding decrease of $196 million, or about 21 percent below the 1994 appropriation level. SCS technical assistance and the planning capabilities, which we consider our very highest priority activities, will be maintained. This assistance would emphasize the protection of wetlands, in- cluding the strengthened delineation responsibility mentioned ear- lier, and assistance for a 300,000 acre enrollment under the regular Wetlands Reserve Program. Other priorities include support for maintenance of the highly erodible land conservation plans, water quality, and assistance to urban and rural communities for the protection of soil and water resources. The watershed construction program would be eliminated, and reductions are proposed in financial assistance provided through the Great Plains Conservation Program, and through RC&D. Without question, Mr. Chairman, this is a tough budget. We are committed to the need for fiscal responsibility and to make the very best use of the resources available to continue our work in protect- ing the soil and water resources of this country. Thank you. We would be happy to entertain any questions. [Clerks note. â ^The biographical sketches of Mr. Lyons, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Reed appear on pages 110 through 112.

The Explanatory Notes appear on pages 130 through 231.] contract employment Mr. DURBIN. Thanks, Mr. Johnson. Let me ask either you or As- sistant Secretary Lyons to apprise us of the current number of con- tract employees within the agency, and if you would at the same time, tell us your current level of FTEs and your planned reduction in force to meet the Administration's goal. Mr. Johnson. With regards to contract, we at present have 110 staff-years on contract, primarily in developing software and work- ing in our computer areas. The employment reduction figures, we are going from a ceiling in 1993 of 13,862, 1994 of 13,711, 1995 of 13,172, although only about 12,800 are affordable under our present budget, and then on down by 1998 to 12,750. Mr. DURBIN. We are, of course, going to do our best to work with the Department to meet these reduction-in-force goals. We are try- ing to keep in perspective the number of contract employees in each agency in hopes that we can add that as part of the discussion in how to meet these goals. 6 The net result will be the same in terms of reducing the tax- payers' liability for the services that are rendered, but I think it's only fair to consider contract employees as well as the full-time civil service employees as we get into this decision process. We are finding that each agency currently has some contract em- ployees. We have to decide whether or not the services that are being provided through contracts are so unique or cost-effective that they should remain under this type of approach. I assume that that will be part of your thinking as you deal with the out-year budgets after this first voyage which you are on here. Mr. Johnson. We will do our best on that issue. WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM Mr. DuRBlN. Let me ask you about technical assistance. One thing that puzzles us is the request by the Administration for a rather substantial expansion of the Wetlands Reserve Program, $240 million to include 300,000 more acres, almost tripling the amount that is currently underway through this program. Aiid of course, the role of your agency in providing technical assistance is very important. Based on the 1992 pilot program, SCS technical assistance costs were about $124 an acre. If we increase the program to 300,000 acres, this comes to about $37.2 million. It will cost you that much to provide the technical assistance needed to get this effort under- way, and yet your request for all technical assistance for next year is only $28.1 million. Mr. Lyons. We are trying to do more with less, Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid. Mr. DURBIN. You obviously would have to. Doesn't this assume then that you wouldn't be using technical assistance dollars for other programs? Mr. Lyons. I think that reflects some of the budget realities. I am sure someone on the staff can give you an estimate of the need and why we came up with that specific number. We are going to continue to attempt, given the Umited resources, to provide the technical assistance at a lower cost. I think the first year or two of WRP was a learning period for us, as well as for ASCS in developing the process. We certainly hope we can reduce the cost of providing technical assistance on WRP acres. Whether or not we can service all the acres that are proposed for enrollment is going to be a matter to be determined in the field. We will certainly try and find what support we can. I don't know if Paul can give a more specific answer than that, but obviously it presents a challenge that we recognize. Mr. DURBIN. Have you allocated the $28.1 million increase for technical assistance as to how much will be used for wetlands re- serve and how much will be used for other purposes? [Pause.l Ms. Palensky. At this point, we have not specifically allocated that. Mr. DURBIN. That puts us in a delicate position, because if we don't agree with the premise of increasing the Wetlands Reserve Program by 300,000 acres, it would then lead us to conclude that $28.1 million is unnecessary, or some part of that amount. So we are going to need some guidance from you in terms of how much you would allocate for that purpose so that we keep the other technical assistance aspects of the agency intact as the next fiscal year gets underway. Would you provide a table, for the record, showing the cost of technical assistance provided to each of the pro- grams you administer for fiscal years 1990 through 1994 as well as estimates for fiscal year 1995. Mr. Johnson. We will be happy to provide that information for the record.

Is the increase of $28,120,000 for technical assist- ance provided for ASCS conservation cost-share program adequate to cover the actual need? Mr. Johnson. Yes, the increased funding is adequate to cover technical assistance needed in 1995 for the ASCS conservation cost- share programs. Proposed funding in the 1995 budget would in- crease the total staffing level for conservation technical assistance provided by reimbursable and directly appropriated funds by ^ percent to 9,448 staff years. The major change in funding tech assistance for the ASCS conservation cost-share programs wou a technical one. Currently, technical assistance is funded as of the ASCS program account through a reimbursable agreei with the Soil Conservation Service. The 1995 budget proposes to fund the technical assistance directly in the Conservation Oper- ations appropriation account. The change is proposed to reflect the creation of a new USDA agency, the Natural Resources Conserva- tion Service, which would include the ASCS conservation cost-share programs except for the Conservation Reserve Program and the Soil Conservation Service programs. WATERSHED AND FLOOD PREVENTION OPERATIONS Mr. DURBIN. Let me talk for a minute about the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations program. This budget request pro- poses to eliminate this program, noting the $25 million request is for phase-out costs. From our perspective, this is one of the main programs of your agency, and I guess I'm a little bit surprised with this proposal when you consider the Administration's environmental commit- ment. This program has been an important part of environmental clean-up, and an important part of overall ecosystem management relating to agriculture. We're concerned about how many projects will be left uncompleted at this point, and who will complete them and continue to improve our watersheds. Mr. Johnson. You're absolutely right. The watershed program has been a very important part of our history, and it still is today. We have a very large number of projects that are in the planning stage. The numbers I have in front of me right now are 595 projects currently in the construction phase, with remaining Fed- eral costs of $1.2 billion. Most of the 595 projects currently in construction are multi-pur- pose. Sixty-five percent have flood prevention as a purpose, 40 per- cent have water quality, 20 percent have water-based recreation, and 15 percent have domestic water supply as a purpose. According to our present budget, no new construction or land treatment contracts will be signed after June 1st, 1994. About 400 contracts in 47 states will not be signed in 285 active projects that were funded in 1994. Mr. DURBIN. What happens to the projects? 10 Mr. Johnson. Some of the projects will be picked up and carried on by local entities. There certainly is local money going into those projects. The others, without the funds, we certainly are not going to be able to carry on with them. Mr. DURBIN. Are there any other Federal programs that they can turn to for completion? Mr. Johnson. I'm not aware of other Federal programs dealing specifically with these issues, but as I mentioned, there are a lot of projects that will go on with local funds, and with state dollars. Mr. DURBIN. Are you continuing to sign-up projects under this program in this fiscal year? Mr. Johnson. We have, but we will certainly stop that under the new budget proposals. Mr. DuRBiN. I would hope so. I think that might be misleading to some of the local sponsors if there is a suggestion that there will be money, and the Administration on the other hand is eliminating the program. Mr. Johnson. There are a number of projects on the books in the watershed program that we are taking a very good look at. The program has changed over the years from one of primarily construction to one of many more land practices. We are in a tran- sition stage there. I've also asked that we would take a very good look at the water- shed projects that we have done, and that we are planning, and make sure that they fit with the needs of society and the needs of our interest in the future to build more multi-purpose uses for those projects. THE 1995 FARM BILL Mr. DURBIN. Let me turn to another subject, perhaps a little cos- mic in nature. In light of this last conversation we had here about the elimination of the watershed program, we are about to embark on a debate over the parameters and direction of the next farm bill. Of course, in the context of budget deficit reduction, we will be making some pretty difficult choices, as we have in the past. In the area of soil conservation, could you outline for me what you consider to be the highest priorities in the next farm bill, in light of the budget realities and what, in 60 days, you have found to be a fact in your new job? Mr. Johnson. First of all, I think it is very important that we carry on the work that we've done over the years, working together with farmers to get conservation on the land with a voluntary edu- cational approach. We are good at that. We've had 60 yeairs of experience with that now, and I think it's essential that we continue to be able to do that. We have the process that was started on highly erodible lands back in 1985 and that's not going to go away. At the end of the ten year period which is December of this year, we will have in place a lot of practices on those highly erodible lands, but we must continue to work with those farmers. 11 As you know, farming can't be done by a recipe, and it's very im- portant that we work hand-in-hand with farmers to keep those goals of reducing erosion, I think as we look to the Clean Water Act, we're going to be much more involved in more holistic planning with farmers, and what we call ecosystem-based assistance where we don't just work on one issue such as soil erosion, but that we look at a much broad- er range of things. We started doing that back in the 1930's with our watersheds. There were multiple issues that we dealt with with farmers, and I think it's essential that we get back to that, and we get out on the land with the farmer and we talk about the needs of that land, and together, we put together the conservation practices. Mr. DURBIN. I'm sure that Iowa farmers, like Illinois farmers, get a little nervous when they hear the terms holistic and ecosystem. [Laughter.] Wondering whether Federal government agents are far behind enforcing these practices and what it's going to cost. Mr. Johnson. Yes. Mr. DURBIN. I have found, as you have, I'm sure, with your back- ground, that the role of farmers in environmental protection is often overlooked. There is a real dedication by the vast majority of farmers to do the right thing with their land. TTiey are frightened by the prospect of dramatic changes in the way they're going to farm in the future which might increase their costs without any help from the government. I guess that really gets to my final point, and that is, do you see, in the next Farm Bill, the need for more effort by the Federal Government for cost- sharing as we try to come up with new conservation goals, and goals consistent with your agency? COST SHARING ASSISTANCE Mr. Johnson. Cost-sharing has always been an important part of getting conservation on the land, and I think it is important, and there are many ways to look at cost-share. There is the ACP pro- gram. We have our Great Plains program. These are all very im- portant. I think as we look to the 1995 farm bill, and look at possibilities here, we should broaden our thoughts a little bit, think a little bit more in terms of innovative ways of doing things. A great deal has been talked about â stewardship payments of one sort or another, and I would like us to take a good look at that. In that regard, I've asked that we pull together some forums around the country and start talking with farmers and with people out on the land, and get some of their ideas on how best we can do that. We have a tendency here to know what farmers need inside the beltway. I've been here two months, and I'm already feeling that tendency. Mr. DURBIN. Suppress that, if you can. [Laughter.] Mr. Johnson. I'm doing my best. One way I want to do it is to make sure that throughout this country we have a very major dia- logue on conservation and how we do these things together. Mr. DURBIN. Fine, and I thank you for that. 12 Mr. Lyons. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuRBiN. Yes. THE 1995 FARM BILL Mr. Lyons. If I could just briefly comment on three points on the farm bill. Having lived through the 1990 Farm Bill, as a member of the staff on the Hill, it was an interesting and enlightening ex- perience to see how this came together. Of course the work we did with the Appropriations Committee was critically important in that vein. But Paul has hit on a very important point. We need to be more efficient and more effective at what we do, and we need to have a wide-range of tools to work with in providing conservation assist- ance to producers, as well as to others who seek conservation serv- ices. I know you are well aware that the demands placed on the Soil Conservation Service now extend beyond simply rural America and into suburban areas, and it is creating a whole new kind of service that we have to provide. What we need to ensure is that we have a wide-range of tools to work with so we can tailor conservation plans to the needs of particular producers. That is one of the reasons we've proposed to shift programs around and put them all in one place. The conserva- tionists on the ground will have a complete tool kit that may run from simply providing technical assistance to providing cost-share assistance where the need truly exists, to land set-aside or ease- ment programs, whatever comes of CRP or the conservation ease- ment programs, or WRP-type programs. We need to custom-tailor a plan to meet producers* specific needs. That is critically important because as we try to look at things on a watershed basis, on a holistic basis, rather than stir- ring up fears of creating a new regulatory framework, we're really tr3dng to provide relief and target assistance to psirticular needs where the problems are particularly great. That's the benefit of looking at the landscape on a watershed basis. Traditionally we've provided assistance to every producer as if the needs were equal across-the-board. As the dollars get tighter, as the resources become more limited, we have to be more focused. This allows us to look at things in context and really target the assistance where it is needed. If we have a wide range of tools and an adequate tool kit, then I think we can do a much more efficient job of delivering the resources and the assistance where it is truly needed. We'll get better conservation for it in the end which is ultimately our goal. Mr. Johnson. We could talk about this all day. Mr. Durbin. I want to defer to my colleagues too. Mr. Johnson. But I think it is very important as well that we try to mesh the programs that we have together with other Federal and state and local agencies. We're doing our best to do that, and I think under the Secretaiys reorganization plans where cost-share programs would be together with the Natural Resources Conserva- tion Service, we would be able to host that process, and really look forward to doing it. 13 I think we have some exciting times ahead of us. EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS Mr. DURBIN. The budget request also proposes to reduce employ- ment by 730 staff years in fiscal year 1995. You propose to reach this reduction through attrition and buy-outs. What is the agency's normal rate of attrition? What action would you have to take if you do not receive buy-out authority? Mr. Johnson. The Soil Conservation Service normally experi- ences an attrition rate of about 3.5 percent. The normal attrition rate will not produce sufficient losses of staff in fiscal year 1995 to meet the decrease of 730 staff years. Much of the decrease is relat- ed to the elimination of the Watershed and Flood Prevention Oper- ations Program. If we do not receive buy-out authority, most of our temporary and intermittent staff will be eliminated to make up the difference, and full-time employees that would normally work on watershed or fiood prevention projects will be reassigned to other programs. The buy-out will provide us more flexibility to manage our decrease in staifing levels. STREAMLINING EFFORTS Mr. DuRBiN. As part of the overall streamlining efforts at the De- partment, many administrative and financial management fiinc- tions at both the headquarters and field levels will be consolidated with those of the Forest Service. Since the Forest Service receives its funding through another subcommittee, how will these costs be separated and budgeted for? Mr. Johnson. At the present time we intend to continue budget- ing and applying costs as we do now. The two agencies will use in- novative management concepts such as lead agency and centers of excellence to perform administrative and financial management functions for both agencies, but each agency will be responsible for paying for its own staff carrying out a particular function. WETLAND DELINEATIONS ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS Mr. DuRBiN. The Administration has acted on wetlands deter- minations and has made SCS the lead agency responsible for delin- eating wetlands on all agricultural lands. You are requesting an in- crease of $15.6 million and 265 staff years to help defray the costs. What is the actual financial impact this will have on your agency's workload and budget? Mr. Johnson. We have estimated that the additional cost will be approximately $16 million annually. These costs are based on the number of additional on-site visits required as a result of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act permit requests and the additional training needed for our technicians to make consistent determina- tions. Numerous estimates of this workload have been made. The information from the Corps of Engineers indicates that SCS will need to make an additional 25,000 determinations annually to service Section 404 requests. Mr. DuRBlN. The notes state that a portion of those funds would cover the additional workload related to appeals. Why do you an- ticipate a greater number of appeals? 14 Mr. Johnson. The number of appeals of Food Security Act deci- sions is expected to increase in 1994 and 1995 for several reasons. First, SCS places a moratorium on the general completion of wet- land determinations in May, 1991, in anticipation of a possible change in wetland criteria. The signing of the Memorandum of Agreement, MOA, in 1994 resolves the question about wetland cri- teria; therefore, SCS is now able to resume wetland detenninations for the rest of the country. Each new wetland determination is ap- pealable. Additionally, the MOA established the procedures to be used to certify wetland determinations as required by the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act, FACTA. When SCS notifies producers that a wetland is to be certified, that deci- sion is also appealable. We expect that most of these remaining wetland determinations and certifications will be completed during fiscal years 1995 through 1997. Second, the MOA also gives SCS the responsibility of making wetland determinations on agricul- tural land for purposes of the Clean Water Act. This will increase the number of wetland determinations requested, and each is ap- pealable. Finally, the 1990 FACTA allowed persons with Food Se- curity Act violations to receive most of their benefits if the Agricul- tural Stabilization and Conservation Service determined that the producer acted in good faith without the intent to violate. However, the good faith sanction can only be used once in 10 years for a wet- land violation and once in 5 years for a compliance violation. Pro- ducers who have already received one good faith sanction, and who violate again, will be more likely to have substantial amounts of benefits at risk, and will be more likely to appeal the decision. Mr. DuRBiN. Describe, for the record, the delineation and appeals process. Mr. Johnson. We will provide that information for the record. [The information follows:] 15 THE DELINEATION PROCESS SCS makes wetland determinations when a Form AD-1026 is received from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service indicating that a determination is needed, and for persons who request determinations for purposes of the Clean Water Act. SCS makes determinations either off-site, using approved mapping conventions and inventories in the office, or on-site by visiting the wetland site and, if needed, a comparison site. Comparison sites may be used to make determinations on disturbed sites where evidence required for making a determination, including soils, vegetation, or hydrology, has been altered or destroyed. Using comparison site procedures, a natural or undisturbed site that has the same soils, landscape position, and general features as the disturbed site, is used to establish what the natural condition of the disturbed site would have been. Wetland delineations are made by establishing that the three wetland criteria -- hydric soils, wetland hydrology, and a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation â are met for the site. SCS relies on tested, established standards for wetland delineations, including soil surveys, aerial photos, published lists of hydrophytes, computer models for determining hydrology, and indicators of wetland features that are peer-reviewed, tested, and accepted by the scientific community. When SCS has determined the presence of a wetland, the land owner, operator, and all others associated with the tract are notified of the decision and given an opportunity to appeal the decision. THE APPEALS PROCESS The FOOD SECURITY ACT administrative appeal procedure allows producers who feel they have been adversely affected by SCS decisions to request review of the following types of decisions: - Highly erodible land determinations - Disapproval of a conservation plan or system - Determination that a producer is not actively applying a conservation plan or not using an approved conservation system - Wetland determinations, including converted wetland determinations - Determinations that a wetland conversion has minimal effect - Approval of a plan for wetland restoration, mitigation, replacement, or non-agricultural use - Eligibility of an area for Conservation Reserve Program or Wetland Reserve Program. Four levels of appeal, representing the four layers of line officers, are provided: The district conservationist, the area conservationist, the state conservationist, and the Chief of SCS. At the first level of appeal, an administrative record is compiled which includes all documentation relied upon in making the decisions, correspondence to and from the appellant, and other pertinent records. A site visit is always made at the district conservationist level, and may also be made at the area conservationist and/or state conservationist level. Appellants may request a hearing at the state conservationist's level. At each level of appeal, the appellant is allowed 15 days to appeal to the next higher level . 16 Appeals to the Chief of SCS are reviewed by technical staffs at the appropriate national technical center and National Headquarters. Decisions by the Chief are the final level of administrative appeal. The appellant is informed by letter of the decision on the appeal and the basis for the decision. If the decision indicates a violation of the FOOD SECURITY ACT provisions, SCS notifies the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) of the decision. ASCS makes determinations as to the effect of the decision on eligibility for Department of Agriculture program benefits, producers affected by the decisions, eligibility for good faith exemption, and other administrative matters. In the interest of reducing the number of appeals and improving communication with producers, SCS is now exploring the use of alternative dispute resolution at the lower levels of the appeal process. 17 NUMBER OF WETLAND DETERMINATIONS Mr. DURBIN. How many determinations will be needed? Mr. Johnson. The SCS has completed determinations on over 2 million farms prior to January 1, 1994. It is estimated that 1 mil- lion more initial determinations are needed to complete the job on agriculture lands. However, that is not the end of our responsibil- ity. The Food, Agricultural, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 and the Memorandum of Agreement with the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Corps of Engineers requires that all wetland determinations completed prior to January 6, 1994 will need to be recertified. They will also need to be evaluated on a five-year cycle. COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES ON HIGHLY ERODIBLE CROPLAND Mr. DURBIN. The 1985 Farm Bill required all farmers to have an approved conservation plan on all highly erodible cropland by De- cember 31, 1989, in order to continue their eligibility for program benefits. The law also requires that these measures be installed by December 31, 1994. We are coming up on this deadline quickly. What is the status of this directive? What percentage of acreage is in compliance to date? Mr. Johnson. The status of this directive is that it is still in ef- fect. SCS continues to work with producers to help modify plans where needed, and to help producers implement these plans on schedule to the extent possible. The Midwest floods of 1993 have delaj'ed the installation of some practices, and some farmers will not be able to get all of their practices installed before January 1, 1995. However, SCS will use temporary one-year variances to the extent necessary to allow these flood-delayed farmers additional time to install their practices. At the end of fiscal year 1993, SCS documented that at least 70% of the acres with Food Security Act conservation compliance plans had all of the scheduled practices in- stalled. However, in the statistically random sample of tracts on which status reviews were conducted in 1993, SCS found that less than 4 percent of the tracts visited were not on schedule to the ex- tent that SCS determined that the farmer was not actively apply- ing the approved conservation compliance plan. Recognizing that additional work will be needed in 1994 to complete the installation of all scheduled practices, we believe that all farmers who intend to be in compliance with their plans can accomplish what is need- ed. In some cases, a temporary substitute practice, such as a grass seeding or a cover crop, may be needed if it is not possible to install a structural practice on time. Mr. DuRBlN. This means that 30 percent of the acres covered under existing compliance need practices installed. I imagine that these are the most difficult installations. How will you meet this workload with only ten months remaining? Mr. Johnson. Although the status of plans that have been in- stalled reports that only 70 percent are complete, additional infor- mation provided by the status review findings indicate that farm- ers who intend to remain eligible for USDA benefits have signifi- cantly more than 70 percent, perhaps closer to 90 percent, of their practices installed. We recognize that some of the remaining prac- 18 tices to be installed are structural and there may be limited avail- ability of contractors, cost-sharing, and technical assistance, but we believe that the farmers who intend to be eligible for USDA bene- fits will be able to do so. Mr. DURBIN. Do you have the necessary resources to assist all farmers in meeting this deadline? Mr. Johnson. SCS has never provided all the technical assist- ance to every farmers at every location needed to install their con- servation compliance plans, and this year is not an exception. We were never intended to be the sole supplier of assistance. Contrac- tors, Conservation District personnel, consultants, and the farmers, themselves are able to do much of the needed technical work, and so we believe that the remaining task is not insurmountable. QUALITY CONTROL FOR COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES Mr. DURBIN. At last year's hearing, Mr. Bridge testified to some concerns the agency had with regards to quality control processes and overall consistency with compliance activities. These concerns had to do with the poor quality of some of the compliance plans that were developed to meet the deadline, the adequacy of docu- mentation of findings during status reviews, and the quality and effectiveness of management controls. What has been done to ad- dress each of these concerns? Mr. Johnson. SCS has made a major effort to review and im- prove the deficient conservation plans so that they are effective tools in helping farmers meet their conservation treatment require- ments. To provide for improved consistency and analysis of status reviews, SCS developed a standard form to record status review findings. During 1993, SCS employees visited over 215,000 highly erodible cropland fields to measure erosion reduction and deter- mine status. Conservation compliance plans were considered as being actively applied on 96 percent of these fields, and we found that the annual soil loss had been reduced by an average of 17.5 tons per acre. We believe that the Nation's farmers have made great strides in learning about and carrying out the conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985. With regard to quality and effectiveness of management controls, we have established a comprehensive system of state, regional, and national oversight in response to OIG audits and other concerns. Each State Conservationist is now required to develop and carry out a state quality control plan. The quality control plan assigns specific staff responsibility and identifies actions and schedules for the quality control activities, including reviews of field decisions and documentation. In addition, the National Technical Center staffs, under guidance from the Assistant Chiefs, conduct quality assurance reviews within every state. A national team has con- ducted in-depth reviews of four states and will review more this year. Although we have made a great deal of progress, we still have some problems to address. For example, there is some concern that a predominant use of crop residue management may lead to inad- equate soil savings, particularly in years with unfavorable climatic conditions. Others are concerned that too much residue will in- 19 crease plant diseases. We will address this issue based upon the best available science and make adjustments where necessary. Tliere is also some concern that Alternative Conservation Sys- tems, ACS, are not achieving consistent and substantial erosion re- ductions, and that producers are retaining benefits even though significant reductions are not being achieved. Within the next two months, we will be receiving an OIG audit of ACS's. Our ACS needs to be consistent, based on sound economic and agronomic reasoning and provide erosion reduction. I also recognize that our present appeals process is burdensome. In that regard, I have established a team to review that process and make recommendations for improvement. It is important to do the best, credible, fair job. We are not here to put farmers out of business. But we should not reduce the ero- sion reduction targets, or look the other way. We are here to help farmers put conservation on the land. FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION OPERATIONS AND CONSERVATION COMPLIANCE Mr. DURBIN. Please update the table that appears on page 194 of last year's hearing record showing the amount appropriated for conservation operations and the amount spent on conservation compliance provisions to include fiscal year 1994. Mr. Johnson. We will provide a table for the record that updates the information through fiscal year 1994. [The information follows:] CONSERVATION COMPUANCE AND CONSERVATION OPERATIONS EXPENDITURES [In thousands of dollars] Year Consen/atlon op- erations Conservation compliance 1985 364,920 1986 348,669 57,532 1987 399,671 165,993 1988 444,391 183,219 1989 465,435 193,347 1990 477,377 198,347 1991 509,509 213,131 1992 564,251 238,960 1993 576,740 245,093 1994 591,178 283,160 EMERGENCY WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM Mr. DURBIN. Part of the $340.5 million that was just appro- priated in the Emergency Supplemental will be used to expand the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program in the nine Midwest States affected by the flooding of 1993. How many acres are currently en- rolled in the program? How much will it be expanded? Mr. Johnson. Through the end of February SCS has received ap- plications for 43,680 acres requesting enrollment in the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program. Of these applications, 25,400 acres are being reviewed for enrollment leaving 18,280 for potential enroll- ment at the present time. Using funding from the 1994 supple- mental, we will hold another, more extended, signup this spring in 20 which we hope to enroll considerable new acreage into the pro- gram. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM AND INFOSHARE Mr. DURBIN. The requested increase of $6.5 million to provide technical assistance for database development investments to im- plement geographic information system, GIS, technology and sup- port InfoShare projects to improve field office operations leads me to a couple of questions. First, provide a brief description of what a geographic information system does. Mr. Johnson. GIS is a computer-based technology that allows the user to input, store, manipulate, analyze, and display geo- graphic data or information about places on the earth's surface. A GIS can be thought of as a database management system with each map representing a data layer of information. With GIS technology, SCS can not only consider what natural resources exist in a county or state, but also show where those resources exist on the land- scape in relation to each other. For example, a GIS can quickly screen areas for potential water quality problems by analyzing different layers of geographic infor- mation. It can quickly determine and graphically display which soils are highly erodible from a digital soil survey for a given area. This information, when combined with slope and stream data, can provide SCS and the land user with locations and acreages of land that will probably deliver sediment, pesticides, and other contami- nants to streams and ground water. Mr. Durbin. How will this system relate to the Department's overall InfoShare proposal? Why are you requesting a separate ap- propriation, can't this be accomplished within the development of InfoShare? Mr. Johnson. The InfoShare project will provide the hardware and general software for the GIS systems in USDA including SCS. We believe InfoShare will also provide USDA the resources to de- velop geographic databases needed to make effective use of GIS for all agencies. InfoShare plans for the next few years, however, are concentrated on the communication networks and computer plat- forms and software to make data sharing a reality in USDA. SCS has current GIS needs to support agency programs such as the Na- tional Cooperative Soil Survey, Conservation Technical Assistance, and other ongoing programs. The $6.5 million requested in the budget is for purchase of digi- tal orthophotography which will be the base map for recording digitally georeferenced natural resource information in the future. The orthophotography will initially be used primarily for mapping and digitizing soil surveys which can be used by GIS. The orthophotography purchase at this time is necessary since it is the basis for all future GIS database development using geographically based data developed by or for SCS. We need to begin the procure- ment of the basic technology now to be ready to implement GIS when the core InfoShare systems are available in several years. Digital orthophotography procurement at this time will com- plement InfoShare since its use will promote data sharing between agencies and standardize data collection. 21 Mr. DURBIN. You state that most of the work involved in this proposal would be contracted to the private sector. Why would you contract this work out as opposed to doing it in-house? Mr. Johnson. SCS currently does not have the capability to produce the quantity of orthophotography needed. There are pri- vate sector contractors that have demonstrated the capability to provide this product at competitive prices and it would not be effi- cient to gear up Federal employment and production facilities for a major project that would last only five or six years. For these rea- sons contracting for the development of digital orthophotos to the private sector is preferred. USDA SUB-OFFICES ON RESERVATIONS Mr. DURBIN. The FACT Act of 1990 directed USDA to establish and staff a sub-office on reservations for a minimum of one day per week, if assistance was requested. The explanatory notes state that many of the more than 310 reservations and four areas of trust land are taking steps to request assistance. How many reservations currently have an established sub-office? How much are you spend- ing to operate these sub-offices? What would the total cost be to provide a sub-office on every reservation? Mr. Johnson. SCS presently has 25 sub-offices on Indian Res- ervations. Fifteen of these offices are staffed with one or more em- ployees fiill time. In accordance with USDA regulations, tribes fur- nish the office space. The cost of operating the 25 sub-offices is ap- proximately $1,875,000. In the immediate future, we estimate that another 40 reservations could request sub-offices. Added to the 25 current offices, the land area represented would make up 95 per- cent of the Indian agriculture land in continental U.S. The esti- mated total cost for the 65 offices would be $3,500,000. U.S. CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN Mr. DURBIN. The U.S. Climate Change Action Plan lists a num- ber of actions in all sectors of the economy that the U.S. will take in order to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Please provide this list for the record. Mr. Johnson. I will provide the Usting for the record.

The budget request includes an increase of $3.0 mil- lion to support three initiatives. One initiative would assist live- stock producers in developing methane capture systems to recover and use methane emissions. Would you tell the Committee how you propose to do this and give us some examples on the uses of meth- ane that are recovered. Mr. Johnson. The initiative calls for expanding the AgSTAR pro- gram with livestock producers. The AgSTAR program is a vol- untary agricultural program which encourages widespread use of methane recovery technologies to increase livestock production profits. Methane recovery systems collect the methane produced by liquid manure management systems so that the methane can be used as a fuel for on-farm energy production. SCS has been in- volved in assisting producers with animal waste management sys- tems for years, and AgSTAR is part of the technology we provide to producers. The SCS is a partner with the Environmental Protec- tion Agency and the Department of Energy in this program. Mr. DURBIN. You have another initiative that will focus on im- proving grazing lands management as a possible way to reduce methane emissions. Please tell us how this will work. Mr. Johnson. SCS is involved in the Climate Change Action to improve ruminant productivity and product marketing which has as one of its benefits the reduction of methane emissions. The SCS work will center around improving grazing lands to increase effi- ciency of production of red meat on individual animals which re- duces the number of animal units per acre for profitable operations and also reduces methane emissions. As part of this program, SCS will implement many of the recommendations which are contained in the report. Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative for Private Grazing Lands. Mr. DURBIN. The Agricultural Research Service, ARS, is also doing some work in this area. Are you coordinating your efforts with ARS? Mr. Johnson. Yes, SCS efforts are being closely coordinated with the work of ARS on this Climate Change Action item. ARS has con- tributed significantly to our proposed approach of improving graz- ing lands for increasing livestock production efficiency. STAFFING FOR THE SOIL SURVEY PROGRAM Mr. DURBIN. For soil surveys and investigations, you propose an emplojrment reduction of three percent below the fiscal year 1993 base. What is the fiscal year 1993 base level and how many staff years does this translate into for fiscal year 1995? Mr. Johnson. The fiscal year 1993 base staff year level is 1,163 fiiU-time equivalents funded by direct appropriations and 119 full- time equivalents funded by reimbursable agreements. The 1995 budget proposes a three percent reduction, or 35 full-time equiva- lents, in staff years funded by direct appropriation to reflect the Secretary of Agriculture's streamlining efforts and the President's Executive Order mandating a government-wide reduction in Fed- eral employment. This reduction combined with the other proposals 27 in the 1995 budget would provide an overall employment level funded by direct appropriation of 1,118 staff years. GEOGRAPHIC IhfFORMATION SYSTEM SOILS DATABASE Mr. DURBIN. You are requesting additional funding of $2.5 mil- lion for soil surveys to support geographic information systems. How does this request relate to the $6.5 million we talked about earlier? Mr. Johnson. The President's budget proposes a total increase of $9.0 million to create a computerized geographic information sys- tem, or GIS, database that is needed to achieve the efficiencies, savings, and improved farmer services proposed in the USD A InfoShare initiative. A $6.5 million increase is requested under the conservation technical assistance program to provide highly accu- rate aerial digital orthoepist base maps which become the primary reference point for all digitized geographically referenced informa- tion stored in the GIS. Soil surveys are the most important basic data set of the GIS. They must be digitized before computer as- sisted conservation or planning can take place. New soil surveys are already being digitized for this purpose, but they cover only about 75 counties of the nation. The remaining soil survey informa- tion must be converted into digital form to provide full GIS bene- fits. A $2.5 million increase is requested for the soil surveys and investigations program to start digitizing recently completed soil surveys for the GIS. Data compilation and quality control would be carried out by current soil conservation staff, and the digitization would be carried out on a contractual basis with others. Recently completed soil surveys would be digitized first, and older surveys would be updated within current funding before being digitized. COMPLETED SOIL SURVEYS Mr. DURBIN. How many soil surveys were completed and pub- lished in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 and how many do you expect to publish in fiscal year 1994? Mr. Johnson. We were able to complete and publish 48 soil sur- veys in fiscal year 1992 and another 55 in 1993. In fiscal year 1994, we anticipate completing and publishing 53 soil surveys. STATUS OF THE THIRD RESOURCE CONSERVATION ACT APPRAISAL Mr. DURBIN. At this time last year, a plan of work for the Third Resources Conservation Act Appraisal had been completed and was undergoing technical analyses. What is the status of this plan? Mr. JOHNSON. The Third Resources Conservation Act Appraisal, RCA III, Plan of Work has been implemented. Over 50 major projects have been initiated as described in the September 1993 RCA Fact Sheet number 4 and Status Report which we will submit for the record. The Soil Conservation Service has the leadership in USDA to coordinate the appraisal and the National Conservation Program. We are also worWng with 19 other Federal agencies. U.S. Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency have been extremely helpful in providing us data and support as have several USDA agencies.

This report will be updated with 1992 NRI data by July 31, 1994. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION A Public Participation Plan is scheduled for completion by December, 1993. At the present time, the plan includes public meetings, an opinion survey, training modules for states, and briefing materials. Two external review committees-for policy and technical aspects-have been established. A public meeting will be held on November 16, 1994 in Washington. Regional and/or state public meetings are planned to begin in the summer of 1994. 34 INFORMATION Several methods of disseminating information about the Third RCA Appraisal are being developed The attached Fact Sheets will be part of a briefing package that should be completed soon. It will be distributed to all State Conservationists, National Technical Centers, as well as National Headquarters staff A newsletter, \"RCA NOTES\" will be distributed on a bimonthly basis A special series of RCA publications and working papers will be launched before December 31, 1993. B 35 COST AND TIMING OF THE THIRD RESOURCE CONSERVATION ACT APPRAISAL Mr. DURBIN. It was estimated that the cost of its implementation would be about $1.2 million annually including staff time. Is this still an accurate figure? Mr. JOHNSON. We used about $1.2 million of our national head- quarters fiscal year 1993 budget to work on the RCA III Appraisal. We plan to use $3.1 miUion in fiscal year 1994 and $2.8 million in fiscal year 1995. Mr. DURBIN. Based on this appraisal, a National Conservation Program would be developed by December 1997. Is this still an ac- curate date? Mr. Johnson. Yes, the Soil Conservation Service will provide the leadership for USDA to obtain public input into the development and formulation of the National Conservation Program for fiscal years 1998 through 2007. EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS FOR CONSERVATION OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES Mr. DURBIN. For snow survey and water forecasting activities, the budget request proposes to reduce employment from the fiscal year 1993 base by 2.6 percent. What is the fiscal year 1993 base level and how many staff years does this translate into? Mr. Johnson. The base level for all employment reductions is the number of staff years funded by direct appropriations in fiscal year 1993. The fiscal year 1993 base level for snow survey and water forecasting activities is 78 staff years. The reduction from fis- cal year 1994 to fiscal year 1995 would be 2 staff years. Mr. Durbin. Provide this same information for the plant mate- rials centers activities which propose a 2.9 percent reduction. Mr. Johnson. The fiscal year 1993 base level for plant materials centers activities is 140 stsdff years. The reduction from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 1995 would be 4 staff years. Mr. Durbin. Why is the percentage reduction different for all these accounts? Mr. Johnson. In response to the Secretary's Departmental Streamlining plan and the President's Executive Order mandating a reduction of Federal positions by the end of fiscal year 1998, fed- eral agencies' staff year estimates for 1995 were reduced by 3 per- cent of their anticipated fiscal year 1993 levels. The Soil Conserva- tion Service was reduced by 730 staff years for a savings of $43.6 milUon. This reduction was further distributed to each program ac- tivity based on the estimated 1993 staffing levels for these pro- grams. Individual program reductions were not redistributed in the President's 1995 budget to reflect actual fiscal year 1993 staffing levels. Consequently, the percentage reduction for each program ac- tivity shown in the 1995 budget will not necessarily be consistent for each program activity. OPERATION OF PLANT MATERIALS CENTERS Mr. Durbin. Please update the table that appears on page 218 of last year's hearing record showing the plant materials centers 36 annual operating costs to reflect flscal years 1993 and 1994 actuals and flscal year 1995 estimates.

STATUS OF PLANT MATERIALS CENTERS RENOVATION Mr. DURBIN. You are now in the fourth year of a flve-year plan to renovate facilities and equipment at these centers. What is the status of this initiative? Are you still on schedule? Mr. Johnson. The flve-year plan to renovate plant materials cen- ter facilities is progressing at investment of about $2.4 million an- nually. We have prioritized the renovation of facilities and equip- ment to be implemented each year, and the upgrade has been fruit- ful to date. 'Hie greenhouses, seed cleaning facilities, equipment, and office space that have been repaired, replaced and/or upgraded have signiflcantly increased the technical capabilities of the pro- gram. However, the renovation is not keeping pace with the time table in the original plan for a couple of reasons. The original ren- ovation plan was prepared in 1988 using current costs, and it in- cluded only the equipment and facilities that had reached the end of their useflil and safe life. Since then, the plan has not been re- vised to reflect the impacts of inflation and other increased costs for equipment and facilities that were part of the initial renovation plan, nor has the plan been revised to include the cost of the addi- 37 tional equipment and facilities that have reached the end of their useful and safe lives since the plan was prepared. We have been developing a long term strategy to protect the federal investment in the plant materials centers and maintain technical capability within the annual appropriation. We want to adequately address the issues that will allow us to avoid requesting additional funds in the future for another renovation initiative. Our first priority is to complete the backlog of buildings and equipment describea in the current renovation initiative. Next, we will replace and/or up- grade the additional backlog of useless and/or unsafe buildings and equipment that has developed since the initiative was planned.

SCS conducts snow surveys and develops water sup- ply forecasts using an automated system called SNOTEL. You are in the process of upgrading this system and expect it to be com- pleted during fiscal year 1994. What is the status of this upgrade? Mr. Johnson. The amended SNOTEL upgrade will essentially be completed as planned this year. Starting in fiscal year 1995, we will continue to invest about $1,000,000 annually to maintain the sophisticated electronic SNOTEL network data collection equip- ment and to support the hardware and software required to oper- ate the program's National Water Resource Database. This level of expenditure will be necessary to continue to provide operational ef- fectiveness, employee safety, and protection of the Federal invest- ment in the SNOTTEL network system. CONSERVATION PROGRAM PRIORITIES Mr. DURBIN. Tell us from a purely technical standpoint, if you could only fund one conservation program, other than technical as- sistance, which one would you choose? Mr. Johnson. It is difficult to rank USDA conservation programs in order of importance because each program is unique and contrib- utes to solving different environmental and conservation problems that range from wetland conservation, fish and wildlife enhance- ment, stream corridor management to erosion prevention, etc. USDA needs a variety of tools that include technical assistance, soil investigations and interpretations, easements, and financial as- sistance to address the scope of environmental and conservation problems. However, if we were to rank USDA conservation programs in pri- ority order, we would have to put the National Cooperative Soil Survey Program immediately after the conservation technical as- sistance program for purely technical reasons. These surveys which are accomplished through a National Cooperative program involv- ing other Federal, State, and local governments and are focused on providing information to the American public. The soil is the mediator between farming practices, agricultural chemicals, waste disposal, and the environment. Consequently, the conservation and sustainability of soil quality is a fundamental first step to environment improvement. Soil surveys provide the in- ventory of the Nation's basic resource to determine the inherent ca- pabilities of the land and from that derive conservation treatment needs and the most sustainable use of the land. With this basic re- source information, lands most vulnerable to erosion, acidification, compaction, pollution, and other forms of soil degradation can be identified. Once these areas are identified, soil survey information is used by conservationists, farmers, ranchers, urban planners, en- vironmental engineers, and other Federal agencies. State and local organizations to design and install site specific conservation prac- tices and to make better informed decisions regarding the appro- priate land use. The result is remediation of the degradation of soil quahty, sustainability of agricultural productivity and improve- ment of intimately related resource problems such as water quality and wetland degradation. 43 PERSONNEL AND FUNDING LEVELS FOR TECHNICAL SERVICE CENTERS Mr. DURBIN. Please update the table that appears on page 204 of last year's hearing record showing the personnel and funding level for each of the four regional technical centers to reflect fiscal year 1993 actuals and fiscal years 1994 and 1995 estimates. Mr. Johnson. I will provide for the record a table that reflects the information requested.

For River Basin Surveys and Investigations, the budget request proposes to reduce emplojmient from the fiscal year 1993 base by 3.0 percent. What is the fiscal year 1993 base level and how many staff years does this translate into for fiscal year 1995? Mr. Johnson. In fiscal year 1993 there were a total of 207 direct staff years in support of the River Basin Surveys and Investiga- tions Program. In support of the Secretary's streamlining efforts and the President's Executive Order mandating a reduction in Fed- eral employment, SCS is reducing employment in "
