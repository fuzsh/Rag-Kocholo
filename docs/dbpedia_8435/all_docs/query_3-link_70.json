        "meta_description": "Downloadable! The context of the education system in Malawi is strongly marked by demographic pressure, a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, striking poverty, and very low human and social development. The Malawian education system has to develop within a heavier demographic context than that of its neighboring countries. Malawi's population, estimated at 13 million inhabitants in 2008, is increasing at the rate of 2.4 percent per year. The 5-16 year old age group represents 37 percent of the total population. This is the highest proportion of that age group in the entire Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. It is estimated that the population growth rate will slowly decrease, but that the primary school age group (6-13 years old) will increase by 20 percent between now and 2018. If universal primary education is reached before 2018, primary school places for 4.8 million children will be needed in 2018.This represents 45 percent more primary school places compared to 2008.",
