        "meta_description": "In Malawi, poverty is prevalent and about four out of five families live in substandard homes with little hope of ever being able to afford a decent house. A typical village hut is built of mud bricks with a dirt floor and grass-thatched roof, which requires frequent repairs. These conditions put the families at high risk of all kinds of diseases with leaky roofs making the house damp and mud floors attracting insects. There are about 1.5 million orphans and vulnerable children in Malawi out of a population of 18.57 million and approximately 21,000 new units are needed every year for the next 10 years to meet housing demand – this far exceeds supply.",

        "text": "The housing need in Malawi\n\nMore than half, or 58.9 %, of the 4.8 million housing units in Malawi are substandard homes. Typically, these houses are made of mud walls and grass thatched roofs. To meet the current housing demand, an estimated 21,000 new units will have to be constructed annually in the next 10 years.\n\nAnchored by the conviction that safe and affordable housing provides a path out of poverty, Habitat for Humanity Malawi has helped over 75,000 families to access decent housing. We work with vulnerable groups to build or improve the place they call home, improve water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, help families recover and rebuild following disasters, and provide informal vocational training. We also advocate for security of land tenure as well as sustainable and inclusive policies and systems that promote access to decent housing.\n\nHabitat’s contribution in Malawi\n\nWorking with vulnerable groups\n\nHabitat for Humanity Malawi builds homes and sanitation facilities with orphans and other vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities in rural communities. We also provide complementary services such as training to raise awareness of malaria and HIV prevention as well as property and inheritance rights. To date we have supported over 7,600 households.\n\nWater, sanitation and hygiene\n\nWe help improve the health and well-being of informal settlement residents and rural communities through constructing user friendly, sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene, or WASH, facilities. We build communities’ capacity to manage the WASH structures and conduct hygiene and sanitation campaigns to raise awareness. To date, 30,652 households have since been served through our WASH interventions.\n\nDisaster risk reduction and response\n\nHabitat Malawi empowers local communities to build back safer and better after disasters and trains local masons to increase their knowledge and skills in building disaster resilient homes. To date we have supported over 16,010 households.\n\nAdvocacy\n\nWe advocate for greater access to land and housing. We als o promote policies that increase access to decent housing for vulnerable groups and low-income families, including the enactment of the National Urban Policy and security of land tenure.\n\nVolunteer engagement\n\nDuring the pandemic, Habitat Malawi connected with volunteers through virtual builds that provide follow ups on construction progress. With the easing of restrictions, we welcome more opportunities to engage with volunteers in various ways to contribute to Habitat’s mission and\n\nachieve long term, sustainable development.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nDonate\n\nTo donate directly to Habitat Malawi, please contact us via the details below or visit habitat.org/donate and select “Designate your donation” to donate to Habitat Malawi.\n\nVolunteer\n\nThe Global Village program is resuming region by region until a safe and quality experience can be provided at scale worldwide.
