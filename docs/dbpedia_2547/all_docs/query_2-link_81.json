        "text": "Eight Biblical Women Who Changed the World\n\nMary Magdalene — demon-possessed, prostitute, or Jesus’s wife? We love to pigeonhole people, catalog them in neat little boxes and shelve them, so we don’t have to think about them again. However, this often keeps us from digging deeper and searching for what may lie beneath. After learning more about Mary Magdalene, I see her as an example of a female whose devotion to Jesus was so profound it transcended all labels and gender norms.\n\nShe was the first at the tomb on Easter morning. Christ chose her to spread the news of his resurrection, the one he entrusted to share that earth-shattering message over and above his 12 disciples. So, of course, it should come as no surprise that her name has been dragged through the mud by those who cannot imagine a woman taking preeminence over men — and feel the need to besmirch her character."
