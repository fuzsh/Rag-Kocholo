        "text": "This article examines the opera music by P.I. Tchaikovsky from the point of view of its Christian orientation as a leading trend in the development of the national opera style of the 19th century and the manifestation of liturgical symbolism in it at different levels of the musical and dramatic whole. Most of the opera compositions of the composer are investigated in the context of the manifestation of iconic elements of Christian culture in them, which is common to Western and Eastern European, with a later branching into two main branches: Catholicism and Orthodoxy. The main liturgical symbols in the drama and musical fabric of opera compositions are highlighted, their gradual increase in each subsequent opera composition by P. Tchaikovsky is noted, in connection with the composer's search for spiritual truths and his appeal to certain subjects, which became the basis for the libretto of opera compositions. The greatest attention is paid to the composer's late operas: \"The Maid of Orleans\" and \"Iolanta\", as compositions with the most pronounced symbolism of the Christian cultural tradition. The question of the manifestation of liturgical symbolism at different levels is revealed: from the general dominant idea of the composition, which can be defined as the main line of drama, its deep focus, to more particular ones, through certain dramatic, stylistic, musical techniques and verbal texts, to musical and intonational formulas, intonation stable complexes, which over time received the status of a symbol, a certain sign of a complex expression of the liturgical musical and intonational, verbal and semantic field, became rhetorical figurations, such as \"Rest with the Saints\" in the Orthodox tradition and \"Dies irea\" in the Catholic.\n\nJonas Lundblad analyses two late cycles of organ music by Franz Liszt, Missa pro Organo and Requiem, both of which were intended exclusively for the Catholic liturgy, more specifically the spoken or Low Mass, and were composed in an introverted, austere and, at least at first glance, simple style. Liszt here eschews the outward drama and technical challenges of his previous organ music as well as much of the expressiveness of his vocal church music. Both works are based on Mass compositions for male choir and organ, but the substantial differences in relation to the original vocal works, while related to the different liturgical contexts of the respective compositions – the sung and the spoken Mass, respectively – are also the fruit of a new conception of the function of (organ) music in the liturgy. Liszt here moves beyond the idea of purely devotional music (intended to express or enhance [the congregation’s] religious feelings), but neither does he wholly subscribe to the total subservience of music to the proclamation of the kerygma that in the Cecilian movement led to the cultivation of an archaic musical style. Instead, according to the author, in these works Liszt intends to support and express the manifold living interaction between the individual believers and the ‘objective’ drama unfolding in the liturgy. He does this through an innovative approach to harmony which avoids traditional cadential resolutions in favour of enharmonic or semitone-based connections and destabilizes the keys of individual movements, subordinating them to the tonality of the cycle as a whole.\n\nFranz Biebl’s Ave Maria is one of the most well-known small-scale choral pieces written in the latter half of the twentieth century. Since its introduction to American choirs in 1970, it has become an important part of the standard choral repertoire and is often performed perennially, especially at Christmas. It was integral to the rise in popularity of Chanticleer, the American professional male chorus, and remains closely associated with the ensemble thanks to it being recorded and published in the United States under Chanticleer’s auspices. Despite these facts, very little has been written about the composer or his iconic setting of the ancient prayer to the Virgin. This project attempts to collect currently available biographical and historical information from sources in Germany and the United States and to reveal new discoveries from personal interviews and previously unpublished letters and recordings. I begin with a comprehensive biography of the composer and the circumstances surrounding the composition of the Ave Maria. I then provide a musical analysis of the piece, uncovering its formal design and signature harmonies. A chronicle of the Ave Maria’s reception in the United States follows, with attention paid to its “discovery” by American collegiate glee clubs, its close association with Chanticleer, and its role in an important legal battle. I conclude with anecdotes and reflections pertaining to the Ave Maria that attempt to help explain why the piece has been so impactful to countless choirs and their audiences."
