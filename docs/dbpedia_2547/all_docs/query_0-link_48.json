        "text": "“How men have to fight for a little freedom! When will the time come when all men will have equal justice?”\n\n– Clara’s diary, Dresden 1849\n\nThe Dresden Revolution\n\nThere’s a weird myth that Clara Schumann was a staunch apolitical conservative. Which is easily disproved by her diary entries detailing the Dresden Revolution. Not only was she living in Dresden during the revolution, she rescued her children during the battle while seven months pregnant.\n\nHer diary’s detailed accounts of the events from May 3rd to 11th in 1849 are striking and horrific.\n\nContent Warning: Violence, death, descriptions of war and terrorizing of civilians.\n\nMay 3rd: Violence breaks out\n\nThe violence broke out in Dresden “like a lightning flash in a clear sky” reads the Litzmann bio. Clara and Robert went on a dinner outing to a restaurant villa, and shortly after they returned home, Clara writes:\n\n“Drums sounded a general alarm, bells rang from every tower, and soon we heard firing. The King had refused the imperial constitution, and they had taken out the poles of his carriage so he couldn’t flee.”\n\nMay 4th: Tensions rise\n\nClara and Robert walked into the city center to find utter lawlessness. Men with scythes stood guard while barricades were built with dug up street cobbles. The King had fled during the night, but soldiers were encamped with cannons near the castle.\n\nThey saw 14 bodies on display in the hospital courtyard as a spectacle. There was no fighting for 24 hrs but Clara writers,\n\n“The tension was dreadful; how would it all end? In what spilling of blood!”\n\nMay 5th: Robert escapes with his life\n\n“A terrible morning!” Clara writes. Rebels knocked on their door wanting Robert to join the revolutionaries in their fight. After Clara refused them twice, they threatened to search the house for him. So Robert and Clara escaped.\n\nClara doesn’t say why Robert couldn’t fight. Some assume it was because he didn’t believe in the cause or was cowardly. More likely it was Robert’s precarious health. His chronic “nervous condition” would’ve made a violent battle impossible to endure. Also, Robert, the sensitive poet, was never a fighting man.\n\nI’m honestly not sure if he knew how to fire a gun. It’s a good thing they ran. He likely would’ve died in the fighting.\n\nBut they fled so quickly to save Robert, they left their children behind with the nanny. Clara writes:\n\n“I was very distressed, but there’d been no time to take the children with us. Besides Robert thought we should be back by evening, though I did not believe it, especially as shortly before we left, they began to storm the city and fight.”\n\nClara, seven months pregnant with her son Ferdinand, took the train out of town with Robert. They walked to the estate of a friend, an old military general and his family living in the small town of Maxen.\n\n“My anxiety all day was frightful, for continually we heard the thunder of the cannon, and my children were in the city. In the evening, I wanted to go into the city to fetch them, but I found no one would accompany me.”\n\nNeither Robert, nor any man, would go into the city with her, not even for the children, for fear of their own lives. Insurgents were conscripting all men capable of fighting into the battle against the king’s soldiers. But eventually Clara found another woman brave enough to go with her.\n\nOnly later in July does her diary say her third son was born. We have to count backward to know she was in her third trimester when this was happening!\n\nMay 7th: Clara rescues her children\n\n“I went to the city at 3 in the morning, accompanied by the daughter of the estate manager. It was a terrible [carriage] drive. I was anxious lest I should never come out of the city again! I did not think that I should return that self-same way, today…\n\nWe walked across a field… We entered [the city] amidst the continuous thunder of the cannon, and suddenly we saw 40 men with scythes coming toward us. At first, we did not know what to do, but we plucked up heart and went quietly through.”\n\nThey walked for miles. When they finally reached Clara’s home, she found all the houses on the street shut.\n\n“It was horrible! Dead silence here; in the city incessant firing. I found the children still asleep, tore them at once from their beds, and had them dressed, put together a few necessaries, and in an hour, we were once more together in the field outside the city… Before dinner we were back in Maxen.”\n\nRobert was beside himself, of course. Clara doesn’t say his opinion on her rescue adventure. (It’s possible, since she left in the middle of the night, she left while he slept.)\n\n“My poor Robert had been spending anxious hours, and was therefore doubly happy now.”\n\nThe Revolutionary Battle:\n\nThat day, she writes of great respect for the revolutionaries, and clearly hoped they would win:\n\n“The people are behaving splendidly, I should never have expected such courage of the Saxons. Reinforcements pour into the town incessantly… But the soldiers also continually receive fresh contingents from Prussia which exasperates the people to the highest pitch.”\n\nThe fighting continued on May 8 – 9. The friend’s estate where they stayed had some aristocrats in residence. Clara writes of discord:\n\n“All these aristocrats spoke of the people merely as canaille and rabble, till it made one quite uncomfortable—our host is the only liberal minded person and tells them roundly what he thinks!”\n\nThe fighting came to an end when fires broke out across the city, destroying whole blocks of buildings including the opera house. The soldiers threatened to bombard the chief barricade, so the provisional government and many revolutionaries, including Richard Wagner, were forced to flee the city.\n\nAftermath of Death and Destruction\n\nOn May 10th, Clara describes frightening violence committed by the Prussian soldiers:\n\n“They shot down every insurgent they found. An inn keeper had to look on while soldiers shot a room full of 26 students one after the other. They are said to have thrown dozens of people from 3rd and 4th story windows.”\n\nHere Clara writes her cry of outrage:\n\nHow men have to fight for a little freedom! When will the time come when all men will have equal justice? How is it possible that the belief can so long have been so deeply rooted among the nobles that they are a different species from the bourgeois!”\n\nOn May 11th, Clara and Robert visited the city and walked the battle grounds:\n\n“One sees thousands of bullets in the houses, whole pieces of wall are broken away, the old opera house has been destroyed by fire… It is terrible to see… Walls of houses were broken through to enable the insurgents to correspond with each other through several houses. How many innocent victims there have been, killed in their own rooms by bullet holes. The Frauenkirche is full of near 500 prisoners.”\n\nThe streets were torn up. Martial law reigned. Thankfully their friends allowed them to stay outside the city with them for weeks. Clara’s father visited and – in evidence that denial is part of human nature – Friedrich Wieck didn’t believe any of the atrocities they’d seen.\n\nEven after they returned home in June, the Prussian soldiers still occupied the city and they were obligated to feed them. Clara complained that food was scarce for months.\n\nThe Exile of Richard Wagner\n\nRichard played an important role in the Dresden revolution. Clara writes:\n\n“Kapellmeister Wagner is said to have played a part among the republicans, to have made speeches from the town hall, to have caused barricades to be built after a system of his own, and many other things!”\n\nBy “other things,” Clara means he was also in the tower of the Frauenkirche, posted as lookout for the invading Prussians. The famous soprano, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, Richard’s favorite singer and Clara’s friend, was also at the barricades and imprisoned for a short time afterwards. #badassdiva\n\nClara Schumann really was admiring and full of respect for Richard’s heroic acts. (They weren’t enemies yet!) A few days later, “bills were issued for Wagner’s apprehension.” There was a legit “WANTED” poster out for Richard’s arrest. He’d be forced into exile in Switzerland. Clara wouldn’t see him again for another ten years, not until after Robert died.\n\nMusical reaction\n\nThe week of the revolution Robert started composing all sorts of German patriotic choral works, songs, and marches inspired by the revolution. Clara was a little busy taking care of her transplanted family during those weeks, oh and then giving birth to her sixth child. But later she wrote choral works and her opus 23 Jucunde Songs to the poetry of political poet Hermann Rollett. The poetry is packed with patriotic symbolism for a united and free Germany.\n\nClara Schumann was a liberal supporter of revolution who expressed those beliefs in her compositions and in her concert programming.\n\nTime for some romantic indulgence. I’ve written multiple posts, probably hundreds of tweets, emphasizing Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann’s professional relationship.\n\nBut it was not strictly professional between them. It was also very personal. Music was love for Clara – thanks to her relationship with Robert – and that rubbed off on Johannes real fast. Love and music were intertwined and inseparable for them.\n\nIf you’ve not read about their professional relationship yet, please START HERE: How Clara Schumann was Brahms’s Mentor Not His Muse or watch the YouTube video\n\nIf you already know about THAT, you may luxuriate in some of young Johannes Brahms’s first love quotes to Clara Schumann. I say love “quotes” because, very few of the letters which survive are what I’d call “love letters.”\n\nThe format of his letters from 1854-56 was basically this: he talked about music, her concerts, his favorite composer of the week, and her kids. He told her musical jokes, shared industry gossip, and always mentioned Robert and hopes for his recovery. Then he’d get embarrassed he hadn’t composed anything to send her, asked when she’d be home, confessed how he longed for her, then maybe asked to kiss her hand. The end.\n\nSo they’re not love letters exactly, but some real romantic zingers amongst daily musician talk.\n\nThe key is – while Robert was alive until July 1856 – Johannes addressed Clara 90% of the time with FORMAL pronouns. In German, there are informal pronouns for family and lovers “Du,” but Johannes mostly stuck to the formal, respectful pronouns “Sie” in letters to Clara, pre-Robert’s death. They were clearly not lovers. His feelings were reverential loving admiration.\n\nYes, I mean it, Clara was not cheating on her husband. Johannes was exceedingly careful to remain respectful of her being a married woman.\n\nBut he still wrote some real heart-stoppers the winter of 1854-1855 . . .\n\nJohannes Brahms’s first love declaration to Clara Schumann\n\nThe first time Johannes wrote Clara he loved her—it was a joke.\n\nShe was depressed her husband was in the hospital and exhausted by having to give concert tours to support the whole family. 21-year-old Johannes loved to make her smile:\n\n“Would to God I were allowed this day instead of writing this letter to you to repeat to you with my own lips that I am dying of love for you. Tears prevent me from saying more! ~ Prince Brah”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Dec. 15th 1854\n\nClara had given him a copy of 1001 Arabian Nights, so he copied this quote for her to entertain her. At the end of the month, Johannes wrote to Robert honestly about how much he admired and loved her:\n\n“How long the separation from your wife seemed to me! I had grown so used to her uplifting presence and had spent such a magnificent summer with her. I had grown to admire and love her so much that everything seemed empty to me and I could only long to see her again.”\n\nJohannes Brahms to Robert Schumann, Dec. 30th 1854\n\nAfter giving 20 concerts across Germany between Oct. 26-Dec. 20, Clara spent Christmas at home then set off for the Netherlands, her first foreign tour without her husband in 13 years. Johannes joined her there for a week. The day after his return to her house in Düsseldorf, he wrote her a letter full of longing and levity:\n\n“My beloved friend, Night has come on again and it is already late, but I can do nothing but think of you and am constantly looking at your dear letter and portrait. What have you done to me? Can’t you remove the spell you have cast over me? …\n\nHow are you? I did not want to ask you to write, but do so long for letters from you. Besides I know only too well how you are—you are holding your head up. So just write me a word or two occasionally and I shall be happy—just a friendly greeting to say that you are keeping well and that you will be back in 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 days!…\n\nDo cheer me with writing me a few lines. I want them so badly but above all I want you.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Jan. 25th, 1855\n\nJohannes’s next letter was entirely about comforting her against her worst fears for Robert. The following letter, after telling her about her children, Johannes writes:\n\n“Your portrait is looking kindly down upon me and I should like to stay the night here, lost in thoughts of you; possibly you are thinking of me too. I feel as if you were.\n\nOh, if only the time could go by quickly. I long for peace—for you. If only you could be quite happy again! You have suffered long and severely enough… At the present moment I am thinking too much of you, and I get no peace… I have resolved to get some fine music paper and occasionally send you a song or a melody instead of my words. It is in any case more eloquent than my words, but I can’t send it to you without music paper!”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Feb. 7, 1855\n\nHe adds a mournful melodic counterpoint exercise (which became the Adagio in his op. 36 sextet many years later) and hoped to start learning to write fugues. The next week, after news of Robert, he wrote:\n\n“Beloved Frau Clara… You were vividly in my thoughts, and I had to lay my book aside because I so distinctly felt you sitting by me… How happy you have made me! I may be so bold as to breathe the gentlest of kisses onto your lovely hand…”\n\nJohannes to Clara, March 3rd, 1855\n\n“My Dearly Beloved Clara, There was no letter by the first post this morning from you. You have no idea how longingly I wait for every post… Every day now seems to me an eternity and I cannot settle down to anything or get myself to work. I cannot even play or think.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, March 21st 1855\n\nClara came home for a few week’s reprieve. They studied theory together and Clara composed her final Romanze in B min. for his 22nd birthday. Josef Joachim gave Franz Liszt’s 4-hand arr. of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony to Johannes for his birthday. Clara and Johannes played it every day for weeks.\n\nClara left for more concerts, and Johannes wrote her every other day:\n\n“My Clara… If only I could send you something really beautiful, which could plainly express my love for you and show you how much I long to have you back!”\n\nJohannes to Clara, June 20th, 1855\n\n“My Beloved Clara… You are quite right to be indignant about the abominable weather… I am so sick of the icy damp air… But, my beloved, you see, as soon as you are here again the sun will come out, and summer will return in all its glory. All that has happened is that it has lost sight of you. That is why it is mourning…\n\nI always kiss the children from you, but I would very much like to give you the kisses back again.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, June 23rd, 1855\n\n“I cannot tell you how I long for your return. I can no longer exist without you. I want so much to be able to hold your hand again and to sit beside you. Everything and everybody seems to me so cold… Please go on loving me as I shall go on loving you* always and forever.\n\nWholly yours, Johannes”\n\nJohannes to Clara, June 25th 1855\n\n*This is one of the few exceptions where he slips in an informal “Du” pronoun, as though he accidentally forgot to write “Sie.”\n\n“Beloved Frau Clara… I am really quivering with expectation of seeing you. Each time I am parted from you it becomes more difficult.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, June 27th 1855\n\nIn July, they went on a walking tour together through the Rhineland – with a lady’s companion for a third wheel. If you’re wondering what Clara thought of all of this, her diary leaves clues:\n\n“I cannot say what a pleasure I find it to enjoy all this with Johannes. He draws in great breaths of nature, and one grows young with him. It is true that I am often sad and that distresses him, but it is only natural that the more inspiring our surroundings, the heavier my heart should grow at the thought that my beloved husband is alone and forsaken whilst I am free to enjoy the glories of nature and the society of the best of friends…”\n\nClara Schumann’s diary, July 1855\n\nAnd that’s the first year of their correspondence. There were 43 more years. Over 750 letters survive.\n\nLots more to say about this relationship beyond Johannes’s sweet love words. In case you haven’t read the following, here are some more blog posts with full details:\n\nWhy Clara was Johannes’s mentor not his muse\n\nWhy Clara and Johannes never married (Or why Johannes would’ve made a terrible husband)\n\n“There is nothing greater than the joy of composing something oneself and then listening to it.”\n\nClara Schumann’s diary, 1846\n\nThe most frequent question I get in my social media DMs comes from women who are confused by the quote, “A woman must not desire to compose,” written by Clara Wieck in 1839.\n\nIt is among her most famous one-liners. Without the crucial context, it implies Clara Schumann thought women shouldn’t compose. It’s mislead many to believe that the reason Clara stopped composing was because she didn’t think she should.\n\nWhich is absolutely false.\n\nAt age 20 when Clara wrote that sad quote, she had only published 11 of her 23 opuses. She did not stop composing. She was only half done. But it’s a very difficult quote to make sense of. Why would one of the greatest, most respected musicians and composers of the 19th century write such a thing? The short answer is: insecurity.\n\nEvery creator has moments where they look at their work and think some version of, “This is trash. I suck. Why do I bother? I should quit.”\n\nFor women during the 19th century, they dealt with so much messaging and heard so often in society that it was wrong for them to compose, their insecurity would often inhabit this gender prejudice. That quote of Clara’s should have quotes AROUND IT. She was parroting what she’d been taught, but the point is:\n\nShe kept on writing music anyway.\n\n(A version of this article was first published on the Donne Foundation blog in 2021. Please check out their website and all the amazing work they’re doing for women composers.)\n\nClara Schumann’s Imposter Syndrome\n\nThe full context of the quote also completely changes its meaning. Clara was basically having a the kind of moment in which we all can relate. If Clara had had social media, her post for the day would’ve been like, “I quit. I can’t do this anymore. Why should I bother? Everyone thinks I suck.”\n\nIn other words, she didn’t actually quit. She was just having a bad day. Even Clara had days where she hated herself, wallowed in depression, and battled imposter syndrome.\n\nShe was young when she wrote it – only 20 years old – but she had just published her 11th opus! This was after her piano concerto opus 7. (For more context, it’s the same age of 20 as when Robert and Johannes were publishing their FIRST opuses.)\n\nBelow is young Clara Wieck 1840, at age 20, the year she wrote the infamous quote, 16 years before she quit composing in 1856.\n\nAlso Clara’s motivation for writing such a harsh statement turns its meaning upside down: She wrote it in response to inadequacy after hearing about ANOTHER WOMAN COMPOSER. (Talk about a moment where she wasn’t really thinking straight…phew!)\n\nMarie Pleyel (1811-1875)\n\nIn 1840, Marie Pleyel, a pianist rival of Clara’s, was having a triumphant tour across the continent. When Marie performed in Leipzig, Clara’s father began duplicitously supporting Marie the way he used to support his daughter. (Yes, Friedrich Wieck did some really awful sh*t in protest of Clara’s engagement to Robert.)\n\nClara was understandably devastated that her father chose to support another woman above his own daughter. She wrote in her diary:\n\n‘Everything that I read about [Marie Pleyel] is an ever clearer proof that she is above me; and if this be so I can hardly fail to be completely downcast. I think that I shall submit to it in time, for indeed oblivion is the fate of every artist who is not creative. I once thought that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose—not one has been able to do it, and why should I expect to? It would be arrogance, though indeed, my Father led me into it in earlier days.’”\n\nClara Schumann’s diary, 1839. (Taken from the Berthold Litzmann biography of Clara Schumann published in 1902, translation by Grace E. Hadow)\n\nIrony of ironies, Clara wrote the quote in response to a rivalry with another woman composer, Marie Pleyel.\n\nClara’s father was on a rampage to sabotage his daughter’s career in retaliation for her refusing to end the engagement to Robert. It was all very tragic and embarrassing. He withdrew his support for Clara and publicly told everyone that Marie Pleyel was better than his own daughter. This had a devastating effect on twenty-year-old Clara’s confidence, though Clara never heard Marie play. The two women never even met.\n\nThe diary entry is full of contradictions, a private painful confession not written out of sense or logic. Clara was upset and confused by the betrayal of the man who’d been her parent, teacher, and career champion.\n\nShe contradicts herself multiple time within the same diary entry: claiming Marie was “proof she is above me” then undermines all women composers. Clara neglects to note, or is unaware of the fact, that Marie was eight years older than her. These inconsistencies show Clara’s vulnerable age of twenty. Though she’d already achieved an international renown as a formidable piano virtuosa, as a composer she was struggling for confidence.\n\nOther similarly contradictory statements appear in her letters around this time. Writing to her fiancée almost two years before the diary entry:\n\n“I always console myself by thinking that I am a woman, and they weren’t born to compose. I often doubt myself. But I remember that you did not want to speak of doubts anymore; I agree with you! Doubt is a disastrous word and also a disastrous state to be in.”\n\nClara Wieck to Robert Schumann, March 4th 1838\n\nShe realizes, even as she’s writing it, that to judge herself based on gender is a statement of self-doubt — or what today is termed imposter syndrome. Her recognition of these thoughts as self-doubt hints that she knew it wasn’t true.\n\nClara Schumann Loved Composing\n\nHer desire to write music, no matter her turmoil, was irrepressible. Clara composed for another fifteen years after these writings. Her opuses 12 through 23 included some of her best works—her piano sonata, piano trio, dozens of lieder, piano romanzes, violin romanzes, a first movement of a second piano concerto, and more.\n\nShe supported other women composers, helping Josephine Lang publish songs, performing Fanny Hensel, and loving the operas of Pauline Viardot. Though society told her she should “not desire to compose,” she never could suppress it or condemn other women for it. Her desire overpowered her self-doubt, thankfully.\n\nClara’s passion for composition shines through in her diary on October 2nd, 1846. At age twenty-seven (already a mother of four), her confidence was growing. After hearing her new Piano Trio in G-minor played for the first time, she writes:\n\n“There is nothing greater than the joy of composing something oneself, and then listening to it.”\n\nClara Schumann’s diary, October 2nd, 1846, age twenty-seven\n\nAmidst her extraordinary career, full of laurels and unparalleled success, her statement implies her love of writing and hearing her own music soared above her joy in performing.\n\nWhy did Clara Schumann stop composing at age 37?\n\nShe doesn’t say, but there are many possibilities.\n\nThe timing, 1856, intersects with the death of her husband. It’s possible her grief played a role in the end of her creations. French composer, Louise Farrenc also stopped composing when her daughter died. Writing music as gifts for her husband had motivated almost half of Clara’s works during marriage. Without him, perhaps it simply hurt too much.\n\nComposition also requires leisure time. American composer, Florence Price wrote that a painful injury became a boon for her creations, “When shall I ever be so fortunate again as to break a foot.” It enabled her the time to write some of her greatest orchestral works.\n\nClara Schumann, age 34 in 1853\n\nAt age 37, Clara’s leisure time all but disappeared when she became a single parent. Under the strain of the perpetual concert tours necessary to support her seven children and her husband’s hospital care, the luxury to compose fell on the sacrificial pile.\n\nThere’s also the factor of reviews and public prejudice against women. Critics were brutal of most women composers and misogyny in Germany got worse and worse in the mid to late 19th century. (I’m still researching this, but Clara’s decisions were definitely influenced by the society around her.)\n\nIn other words, Clara quit composing for many reasons, but because “a woman should not desire to compose” was not one of them.\n\nMisogyny Against Women Composers\n\nPublications attesting to how women should not or could not compose were numerous in the 19th century. Here’s one a pamphlet circulated in 1873 by Otto Gumprecht titled “Women in Music”:\n\n“Explains the lack of women in music as a natural outgrowth of women’s supposedly essential inability to handle challenging intellectual tasks such as music composition.”\n\nAs quoted in Brahms in the Priesthood of Art by Laurie MacManus\n\nThat this harmful rhetoric made its way into Clara’s diary is no surprise. In fact, Clara’s confession is irrefutable proof of how these messages affected women composers, of the internal struggles they faced because of the external messages. Thanks to Clara’s diary no one can try to say that women weren’t bothered by what people said about them.\n\nPerhaps Clara’s belief on the subject of women composers should be summed up as confusion—confusion that society preached she should not be capable of what she innately desired.\n\nMy plea for the future: When we speak of Clara Schumann the composer, may the line we quote of hers not be one of self-doubt but one of irrepressible desire:\n\n“There is nothing greater than the joy of composing.”\n\n~ Clara Schumann\n\nThis story is classic. A historic day in music history, the day 20-year-old Johannes Brahms met the woman who would make his career and, in many ways, define the rest of his life. The story has been told and retold so many times, it’s hard to know what’s true anymore. The details of the day Johannes Brahms walked into Clara Schumann’s parlor may be just lore—who knows! But most recountings don’t mention what was happening with Clara that day.\n\nHint: She wasn’t exactly looking for a lifechanging encounter.\n\nOctober 1st, 1853, the day Johannes walked through their front door, the Schumanns were frankly a mess. Both Clara and Robert’s lives were on a teetering brink of collapse—though if you’d asked them, they would’ve said, “Everything’s fine!”\n\nUhhh, no, it wasn’t.\n\nClara’s Career Crisis\n\nJust before Johannes’s arrival, Clara realized she was pregnant again, for the 10th time with baby number 8. The concert tour she’d planned for England the next spring—one she’d been wanting since she began English lessons at age 19—had to be cancelled again. Her diary is full of despair:\n\n“My last good years are passing away, and my powers too—there is certainly reason enough for me to distress myself. I am more discouraged than I can say.”\n\nShe was terrified her career would soon be over, and she was wasting her last years caged to motherhood. (It wasn’t true, but she didn’t know that.)\n\nFor Robert’s part, his position as director of the Düsseldorf Symphony was on tenterhooks. He’d missed the first two subscription concerts of the previous season for being debilitated with nervous attacks and melancholy. His health had improved over the summer, so both he and Clara asserted that he was better. But other people from outside observed differently. Robert’s first subscription concert of the season, at the end of October, would be his last chance to prove himself.\n\nAnd so, it’s no wonder that when Johannes knocked on their door, they saw him like a savior sent from heaven, a bright light in their depressing circumstances.\n\nHow did Johannes Brahms meet the Schumanns?\n\nAt age 20, Johannes left Hamburg the previous spring to do a recital tour with a violinist friend. He met a host of people along the way—most importantly, Josef Joachim. The two were instant best buds. Josef, so enchanted by Johannes’s compositions, sent him off with a letter of introduction to the Schumanns.\n\nJohannes literally walked there. He was on a walking tour along the Rhine, stopping at the homes of other people, turning hearts with his work and his handsome charm. Although—not without mishap. He had horrible stage freight which sometimes made him too nervous to play—which happened in Weimar in front of Franz Liszt.\n\nYes, young Johannes had performance anxiety.\n\nBut he skipped into Düsseldorf and knocked on the Schumanns’ door.\n\n(From here, the tale might be just lore. I haven’t found it in any letters or diaries, but lots of biographers and lecturers have repeated it so I’ll share it too!)\n\nBrahms has arrived.\n\nSupposedly… The first day Johannes knocked on the door, the Schumanns’ eldest daughter, thirteen-year-old Marie answered. Her parents had gone out, she told him, he should call back tomorrow.\n\nSo the next day, he knocked again. This time Robert answered in his dressing gown and slippers. To say the least, it was awkward. Robert in his informal attire, his no doubt stressed expression, and his difficulty focusing on conversations, coupled with Johannes’s shyness, well… Not much was spoken. Except the exchange of the letter from Joachim, then Johannes sat at the parlor piano to play.\n\nHe began with his first C Major sonata, the one that references Beethoven’s Hammerklavier and the Waldstein on the first page. He barely finished the first page before Robert stopped him. “I must get Clara,” he said and left to get the only person whose opinion mattered to him.\n\nAs is so typical of these stories, Clara’s actions aren’t mentioned, but I imagine she was vexed, tired, and not interested in hearing the music of some stranger come to call. She had a house full of children, maybe some very unwelcome morning sickness, and the prospect of a failing career before her. But join Robert she did, and listened to Johannes.\n\nAnd listened. And listened some more.\n\nAt the end, Robert put his hand on Johannes’s shoulder and said, “You and I, we understand each other,” then invited Johannes to return for lunch the next day. But Robert had said so little—and apparently Clara as well—or perhaps something else happened, but Johannes was reticent to come back.\n\nRobert’s diary entry was simply, “Brahms from Hamburg—a genius.” Clara’s entry is effusive and detailed and obviously meant to show not just her reactions but her husband’s as well:\n\n“This month introduced us to a wonderful person. Brahms, a composer from Hamburg—20 years old. Here again is one who comes as if sent from God. –He played us sonatas, scherzos etc, of his own, all of them showing exuberant imagination, depth of feeling, and mastery of form. Robert says that there was nothing that he could tell him to take away or add.\n\n“It is really moving to see him sitting at the piano with his interesting young face which becomes transfigured when he plays, his beautiful hands which overcome the greatest difficulties with ease (his things are very difficult), and in addition to these remarkable compositions. …What he played to us is so masterly that one cannot but think that the good God sent him into the world ready-made.\n\n“He has a great future before him, for he will first find the true field for his genius when he begins to write for the orchestra. Robert says there is nothing to wish except that heaven may preserve his health.”\n\nOr perhaps she should’ve simply wished for him to come back, because the next day, Johannes didn’t show for lunch. I suspect he was very socially awkward. Clara had to go out and find him. She had to search all the inns in town and bring him back with her.\n\nI can’t help envisioning what that was like—Clara going out to search for the nervous young Johannes. She was likely anxious to make sure he didn’t leave town—to make sure he came back. She and Robert wanted more of his music!\n\nBrahms Moved In\n\nThey eventually convinced Johannes to stay with them for the month, at least until Joachim came and played on Robert’s fateful, final subscription concert.\n\nClara started giving him piano lessons, immediately, seemingly without Robert’s knowing. When Johannes played for them one evening and his playing was markedly better, Robert wrote to Joachim, “I suspect my wife is behind it.”\n\nEven so, Johannes was reluctant to stay. They had to coax and convince him not to leave. Was his reluctance simply out of modesty? Not wanting to be a burden in their already full household? Or was it something else?\n\nRobert’s failing health must have been hard to watch. Clara’s denial, insisting that Robert’s health was improving and he was getting well, could not have been easy to witness.\n\nOr were there other reasons? Was Johannes experiencing awkward feelings for Clara from the start that made it uncomfortable living in the same house with her and her husband? Those countless hours sitting together at the piano, working on not just his technique but his compositions, put them in daily close contact for hours at a time.\n\nWhatever the reasons for his hesitancy, Johannes relented and stayed. Clara’s diary entries for the month mention him almost every day.\n\nProbably next you’ll want to read about how Clara was more Johannes’s mentor than his muse. Or maybe you’re more interested in Why Clara and Johannes Never Married (Or why Johannes would’ve made a terrible husband).\n\nMany of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms’s orchestral works have Clara Schumann’s fingerprints—quite literally—all over them. Her input is most obvious on Robert’s piano concerto and on Johannes’s first piano concerto, but third on the list of works she most influenced is, perhaps, Johannes’s German Requiem.\n\nEarly seeds of the work are visible in Clara’s diary over a decade before Johannes began it—a work written for the living whose text choices reflect the very purpose music and poetry served in their lives: trösten, i.e. comfort and consolation.\n\nThe “poetry” was the most important part of the work for them.\n\nJohannes sent Clara the words for movements one and two before he shared the music with her, asking her approval in choosing German above Latin. The theme of comforting the bereaved runs throughout, most overtly in the text of the first and fifth movements. One line in the third movement could sum up the meaning of the whole work: “Wess soll ich mich trösten?” [Who should I console myself with?]\n\nThe work is, in essence, about the search for comfort in the face of grief.\n\nThe Requiem’s Origins\n\n“Oh how beautiful music is! It consoles me so often when I’d like to cry…”\n\nClara Wieck to Robert Schumann, 1838\n\nTeenage Clara wrote that to Robert before they married. Johannes figured this out about her—how music was her source of comfort—early in their relationship. Days after Robert jumped in the Rhine, Johannes returned to Düsseldorf and knocked on Clara’s door:\n\n“He said he had only come to comfort me with music, if I had any wish for it.”\n\nClara Schumann’s diary, March 1854\n\nThe first seed for the idea—echoed in the Requiem’s first full performance at the Bremen Cathedral on Good Friday in 1868—was likely planted for Johannes the spring of 1855. He and Clara went to see Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis at the great, unfinished cathedral in Cologne.\n\nBoth of them heard the work for the first time. Clara’s diary reflects Johannes’s reaction, “It quite overpowered us.” And the next day:\n\n“Johannes and I went over the Cathedral, and the same idea struck us both that the Mass, in its greatness and its art, is like the Cathedral, which looks as if it too were the work of the gods.”\n\nClara’s diary, April 1854\n\nCuriously, Clara adds the Biblical quote: “But to our feet no resting-place is given!”\n\nAfter the trip they went home to Düsseldorf and began studying the Ninth Symphony together, playing it 4-hands every day for weeks. They also delved deeply into the study of fugue writing, which Clara had mastered the previous decade (see her opus 16 Preludes and Fugues). Johannes had not yet learned how to write them.\n\nYes, Clara was partiality responsible for Johannes’s meticulous obsession with counterpoint.\n\nRobert’s Death and Clara’s Grief\n\nThe theme of death runs through many of Johannes’s choral works throughout his life (see Nicole Grimes’s book from Cambridge UP, Brahms Elegies). This began shortly after Robert’s death.\n\nJohannes visited Robert perhaps four or five times in the hospital over a period of two years, while Robert slowly deteriorated from syphilis. Clara and the children were forbidden by the doctors to visit. His responsibility, in addition to the visits, was to give Clara hopeful reports of Robert’s condition, which was a lot to ask of a 21-year-old.\n\nJohannes admired Clara’s grief, described her tears and pain as “beautiful,” and he struggled to comfort her genuinely, not superficially.\n\n“How your letter frightened me yesterday and touched me to the core, it is so clearly imprinted with the greatest pain. What you have suffered, and what you are suffering now! Oh, in that hour I probably could not have comforted you, because whoever comes with pathetic comfort does not feel the great pain…”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Jan 1855\n\nAt age 23, he watched Clara sit beside her emaciated and no longer cognitively lucid husband (wracked by hallucinations and fits of violence) for two days, until Robert was finally released from his earthly suffering and died. Johannes was Clara’s primary shoulder of support during that week and in the months that followed. The experience—the brutality of death, the cruelty of mortality, the mercilessness of fate, along with the painful grief of the loved ones left behind—marked young Johannes for the rest of his life.\n\nThe struggle to comfort Clara only grew worse:\n\n“I want nothing more than to comfort you, but how? It seems to me so indescribably hard what you suffer… If you could feel the love with which I think of you so often, you would sometimes be comforted. I love you unspeakably, my Clara, as much as I can.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, October 1856\n\nHe told silly jokes to try to make her laugh and sent her music. But even as she was giving 30-plus concerts per season on tours across the continent, Clara’s grief lingered for years, turning into a grief disorder, longing for her own death.\n\nJohannes tried to encourage her, compassionately but also in a preacher-like fashion:\n\n“My dear Clara, you really must try hard to keep your melancholy within bounds and see that it does not last too long. Life is precious and such moods as the one you are in consume us body and soul. Do not imagine that life has little more in store for you. It is not true… Why do you suppose that man was given the divine gift of hope? … Do not make light of what I say, because I mean it. Body and soul are ruined by persisting in melancholy, and one must at all costs overcome it.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Oct. 1857\n\nBut Johannes composed a gravesong for her, his opus 13 Grabegesang, in 1858. Clara’s reply, after sharing her critiques and favorite phrases:\n\n“I have had it in my mind for days. I should like to have it sung at my grave some day—I believe that in writing it you must have thought of me!”\n\n~Clara Schumann to Johannes Brahms December 20th, 1858, about Grabgesang op. 13\n\nBut in retrospect, Johannes did not recall bearing Clara’s grief as difficult, in fact, the opposite. Six years later he addressed her urge to apologize for burdening him:\n\n“You often complain to me about all the things I had to hear or suffer, and I only heard and experienced the most beautiful things with you. I lived like I was in heaven, even when you were sad and serious.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Dec. 1864\n\nFor Johannes, grief was not something to fear or avoid but rather something he found beautiful to witness, a sign of deep love which he admired and treasured. Yet he did fear it for himself, the grief that awaited him, dreading the day he would lose his beloved mother:\n\n“My love only makes me anxious that mother will get even older, who knows how soon I will have the deepest pain.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, April 1864\n\nJohannes spent lots of time conducting a women’s choir, and wrote many choral works, including a Mass he never finished. He premiered and published the D minor Piano Concerto, but his first attempts at the C minor symphony were abandoned in 1862, to Clara’s consternation, shortly after he sent her the first draft. Writing an actual requiem was not an option yet—mainly because he was too young.\n\nRobert’s Requiem\n\nRobert composed a Requiem with the traditional Latin text two years before his hospitalization. Johannes and Clara both heard Robert speak of the work alongside ideations of his own death, likening it to Mozart’s, as in composed for himself.\n\nNot yet 30 years old, Johannes probably didn’t want to scare himself, or Clara, to death by writing his own Latin Requiem.\n\nClara spent many years agonizing over whether to have Robert’s Requiem published posthumously, asking Johannes’s opinion on the work and his help editing it. Johannes hints why his Requiem does not include metronome markings, as he advised Clara against it for Robert’s:\n\nI find it both impossible and unnecessary… You will write new numbers each time… Also bear in mind that you cannot have choral and orchestral works played to you for this purpose – and on the piano, because of the lighter sound, everything plays more lively, faster, and also gives in more easily in tempo.\n\nJohannes to Clara, April 1861\n\nIn 1861, Johannes’s new choral pieces were performed on a concert with Cherubini’s Requiem, which he told Clara was a “beautiful” work. He also performed Robert’s Requiem für Mignon in Vienna in 1863 which pleased Clara very much.\n\nCoincidentally or not, Clara finally succeeded in publishing Robert’s Requiem in 1865, the same year Johannes began his German Requiem.\n\nNo doubt Johannes and Clara were very aware that Richard Wagner’s long-awaited Tristan und Isolde also premiered in 1865. (It’s hard not to see the contrast between the drama and the Requiem, and the possibility that some of it was reactionary. For example, the repeated V-I at the beginning of the very morbid second movement, as if Johannes is saying, you cannot avoid death by withholding resolution. It’s already here.)\n\nThe First Composition Year, 1865\n\nIn February of 1865, the event happened which finally pushed Johannes to compose his Requiem. His mother died very suddenly of a stroke. He wrote Clara of the news:\n\n“And so take comfort in the fact that God made our farewell to our mother as mild as possible… We shouldn’t complain about the harshness of the fate that took away a 76-year-old mother from us; we can only mourn our loss quietly and make sure that our sister doesn’t feel it too harshly.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Feb. 1865\n\nHe was more worried about Clara’s reaction and about comforting his sister than he was able to express his own grief in writing. Clara responded:\n\n“My dear Johannes, finally the moment has come, when you too should have the great pain which you have so often feared.”\n\nClara to Johannes, Feb. 1865\n\nJohannes was living in Vienna, and once back at his apartment in March, he replied:\n\nMy dearest Clara, Through your kind, heartfelt letter I felt your closeness in the way one could only wish to feel the closeness of one’s friends…\n\nTime changes everything, for better or worse, not changing, but forming and developing. And so, after the sad year, I will only later lose and be deprived of my good and dear mother more and more. I don’t want to write about how much consolation our loss actually had, how it ended a relationship that could only have become increasingly murky.\n\nAnd for that I can only thank heaven for allowing my mother to grow so old and to pass away so gently…\n\nJohannes to Clara, Feb. 1865\n\nHe and Clara also talked around this time about the extreme vanity of many artists and their pandering to be popular with the public and to please the critics:\n\nIn general, it’s like this: life here, the whole of Vienna, is becoming more and more comfortable, but the people and even the artists are becoming more and more disgusting, the way they face the audience and the critics, play in front of them and depend on them, is deteriorating. Everyone feels like taking part in the scam.\n\nJohannes to Clara, March 1865\n\nWhen Clara cancelled her concerts in Vienna because of a hand injury, he wrote her words of some uncharacteristic preachiness, clearly spending some time with his Bible:\n\nAbove all, I hope that you take the matter as a whole not as befits a Christian who is supposed to lustfully carry large and small crosses, but as befits a person who, like you, has always done his duty nicely , well, what can be expected from the deity, and also not you but the Tiergarten [where she fell and injured her hand] caused this misfortune.\n\nI know it’s easy to preach, but your heart shouldn’t be heavy with earthly worries – you don’t need to be afraid of the hereafter.\n\nJohannes to Clara, March 1865\n\nHe began composing again. In April, his letter to Clara contained the most often excised movement of the Requiem, “Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen” (How lovely is thy dwelling place), and hints about a larger work:\n\n“The choral piece is from a kind of german Requiem, which I’m currently flirting with… Hopefully you have some quiet time for my scribbling and for a few lines of criticism.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, April 1865\n\nAlso in the letter was a booklet of songs (unnamed) and questions to be answered about publishing his Paganini variations, before Clara left to give concerts in England.\n\nJohannes’s next letter shows how the idea of a German Requiem has taken root and his hope not to abandon it like he had the symphony, the mass, and many other things:\n\nDearest Clara,\n\nIt’s so annoying that you really are in England now, that the most beautiful spring has nothing to do with you, that I’m still causing you useless trouble with notes and all that! [He discusses when he plans to arrive in Baden at the end of May.]\n\nIf it’s still early enough, please don’t show Joachim the choral piece [Wie lieblich sind deine Wohnungen] – in fact it’s probably the weakest in the whole German Requiem. Since this [requiem] might not disappear until you get to Baden, read the beautiful words here that start it.\n\nA choir in F major without violins, but accompanied by harp and other beauties:\n\n“Blessed are those who suffer,\n\nfor they shall be comforted.\n\nThose who sow with tears\n\nwill reap with joy.\n\nThey go and cry\n\nand bear noble seeds\n\nand come with joy\n\nand bring their sheaves.”\n\nI compiled the text from the Bible. The chorus I sent is No. 4.\n\nThe 2nd is in C minor and in marching tempo:\n\n“For all flesh is like grass\n\nand all the glory of man\n\nlike the flowers of grass.\n\nThe grass has withered\n\nand the flowers fell off” etc.\n\nSo a German text you can like as much as the usual Latin?\n\nI hope really to bring a kind of whole [piece] together, and wish to retain courage and desire for once.\n\nJohannes to Clara, April 24, 1865.\n\nWithin that letter, the line breaks for the Requiem text quotations are those which Johannes wrote. These point to how he organized them more like poetry rather than biblical verses.\n\nIn Clara’s response from London on May 1st, the first paragraph encourages him to find a comfortable place to work and not spend too much time strolling in the spring weather. She discusses the publication order of the Paganini variations, and then:\n\nI like the chorus from the Requiem very much, I think it must sound wonderful – I especially like it up to the figured passage, what I don’t like so much is where it goes on:\n\nbut, that’s a small thing! I hope you don’t let the Requiem evaporate [verduften], and after such a beautiful beginning, you can’t. No doubt the beautiful German words are dearer to me than the Latin ones, thank you for that too.\n\nClara to Johannes, May 1865\n\nPerhaps somewhere along the journey of publishing Robert’s Requiem, she had expressed regret or frustration to Johannes about the Latin text and a desire for a German one. How much meaning a German text had for Clara, Johannes, and all north German Lutherans requires a little historical context.\n\nWHY GERMAN?\n\nThe north Germans were the first in Europe to separate from the mighty Roman Catholic Church in 1517 with the Reformation lead by Martin Luther. There were wars fought and tens of millions – whole generations of Germans – died defending their right to have independence from the corruptions of Papal supremacy.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the German people were still divided into dozens of vulnerable small nation states, surrounded by and still under threat of invasion from all catholic sides: the French, the Austrians, and the Pope. The Franco-Prussian War was around the corner, two years after the Requiem’s premiere in 1870 when the French would invade Germany once more. The Lutheran Germans were still in many ways considered the barbarians of central Europe by their catholic neighbors. The roots of German Romanticism, the pursuit of great art by all the artists of this period, was driven by the desire to prove that Germans were not lesser humans but prove their worth with a rich sophisticated culture.\n\nSo, singing a Requiem in Latin felt a little like giving themselves over to death in the language of their oppressor. A work in their own language held an unimaginable amount of humanist consolation, pride in their identity, and also assertion of their equality—a very democratic, enlightenment-esque idea. A requiem in German was radical. As was a requiem without any mention of Jesus Christ. Even the work’s use of the choir in every movement, with none dedicated to soloists, seems a reference to how it is a work for the people—as in not for the glory of clergy or aristocrats.\n\nClara and Johannes believed in God but Art, poetry, music—that was their religion.\n\n[Note: If you are doing research for program notes or another publication, please credit me, Sarah Fritz, for my research or… maybe hire me to write it for you.]\n\nFrom her concert tour in London, Clara wrote Johannes, anxiously looking forward to their summer together in Baden, clearly with high hopes for his new compositions:\n\n“Please, tell me soon, how you are and what you weave? I think to myself, you are very hardworking and will soon refresh me with new beautiful things.”\n\nClara to Johannes, May 1865\n\nPresumably Johannes and Clara spent the summer in Baden-Baden going over the first drafts of the opening movements of his Requiem. Sadly, no diary entries or correspondence survives. Though in a letter in the autumn, Johannes wrote her:\n\n“I think of you often in the most beautiful adagio tempo and quite con espressione.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Dec. 1865\n\nComposition Year Two, 1866\n\nBy 1866, Johannes was 33-years-old, somewhat closer to an age when a Requiem was an appropriate composition, though still relatively young for such an intense work about human mortality. In contrast, Clara was quite a bit closer, now aged 47.\n\nThe next mention of the Requiem in Clara’s surviving diaries and correspondence comes the following summer, on August 17th 1866. Johannes arrived at her house in Baden, not just with the Requiem, but also with his first measurable beard, which made Clara “most indignant”:\n\n“It quite spoils the refinement of his face.”\n\nClara’s diary, Aug. 1866\n\nAbout the Requiem she writes:\n\n“He played some magnificent numbers from a German Requiem, and also a string quartet in C minor. But I am most moved by the Requiem; it is full of thoughts at once tender & bold, I have no clear idea of how it will sound, but in my own mind it sounds glorious…”\n\nClara’s diary, Aug. 1866\n\nThe next month, she spent the afternoon of September 16th with 4 other composers, including Max Bruch and Johannes, playing thru the Requiem, “…which is full of wonderful beauties and bold ideas.”\n\nFor Christmas in 1866, Johannes sent Clara “the beautiful Christmas promise,” a piano reduction of the Requiem:\n\n“I was very pleased with the piano reduction of the Requiem, and I really enjoyed it again. I just want to be able to sing all the voices at the same time – by the way, your arrangement is beautiful, plays comfortably and yet is so rich.”\n\nClara to Johannes, Dec. 1866\n\nAfter spending her Christmas holiday enjoying her present, she writes her most significant surviving opinion and critique of the work:\n\n“I still have to tell you that I am completely filled with your Requiem, it is a very powerful piece that touches the whole person in a way that little else can. The deep seriousness, combined with all the magic of poetry, has a wonderful, shocking and soothing effect. As you know, I can never really put it into words, but I feel the entire rich treasure of this work to the core, and the enthusiasm that comes from every piece moves me deeply, which is why I can’t contain myself from saying it.\n\nI recently went through it with Bruch and Rudorff, twice, and they felt the same way as me, they were also completely moved. One thing I had already noticed several times, and the gentlemen found it too, namely that the 5th movement was somewhat stretched towards the end, the beautiful climax is repeated twice, and the second time it no longer seems as such. [This refers to what became the 6th movement, as the 5th movement “Traurigkeit” had not yet been composed.]\n\nI hope you get through with the performance of the work — only the large pedal point fugue is actually very difficult. Oh, if I could hear it, what I wouldn’t give!\n\nBy the way, I still have to tell you that I think the piano reduction is excellent, and only to you can it seem defective, because you have everything in mind.\n\nI couldn’t show your Requiem to Hiller because he wasn’t here and I only saw him once a few hours before I received it.”\n\nClara to Johannes, Jan. 1867\n\nClara was always fond of “beautiful pedal points,” and Johannes knew her “weakness” for them, so every pedal point, particularly at the beginning of movement one, add BCC: Clara.\n\nMost of Johannes’s letters from 1867 and 1868 were destroyed because he was very coarse and often rude. (Clara returned to him the ones she didn’t like, at his request in 1888, and he dropped them in the Danube.) Perhaps the reason for his ill-mood is visible in the next set of songs he sent to Clara that fall.\n\n“I have never been able to get through the F sharp minor song [op. 48/7 Herbstgefühl] without tears coming to my eyes, which of course, as you will say, happens easily. I only believe that the mood in it is your own as long as you wrote it – it would be a great pain for me if I had to believe that you often felt that way! No, dear Johannes, you, a man of talent, in the prime of life, with life still ahead of you, must not give room to such brooding thoughts.”\n\nClara to Johannes, Oct. 1867\n\nClara was understandably horrified that Johannes was having thoughts akin to suicide, though she rather insensitively urged him to find a rich girl to make him happy in Vienna and get married. The letter ends with her best wishes for the Requiem’s Vienna premiere:\n\n“If only I could hear the Requiem on December 1st! I will be with you with all my thoughts.”\n\nClara to Johannes, Dec. 1867\n\nThe Premiere\n\nThe Vienna premiere was a flop. It was hissed by the audience. (How Johannes ever expected Catholic Vienna to appreciate a German Requiem, I don’t know.) But it was also under-rehearsed. The critic Eduard Hanslick wrote that the third movement fugue – the pedal point one which Clara highlighted as “difficult” – sounded like a train roaring through a tunnel.\n\nClara was still writing lovely hopes to Johannes about seeing it:\n\nHow much I live in hope that on April 10th, I’ll be among your listeners. My heart beats faster when I think about hearing your Requiem so soon.\n\nClara to Johannes, from Brussels, Jan. 1868\n\nHer presence at the premiere in Bremen meant much to Johannes, as the ill reception in Vienna weighed on him:\n\n“If you could listen on Good Friday, that would be an incredible and great joy for me. That would be half the performance for me! If something goes according to plan, you should be surprised and happy. But unfortunately, I’m not the kind of person who gets more than what people good-naturedly give him, and that’s always very little. So I’m bracing myself that this time, like in Vienna, things will be rushed, too rushed and fleeting; but come on!! … let me hope you’ll listen on April 10th. It’s not just about hearing, seeing is just as important to me.”\n\nJohannes to Clara, Feb. 1868\n\nHe also asked her about what fees she received from publishers for Robert’s Requiem to give him an idea what to ask for his. Then thoughtlessly, carelessly he asked when she was going to stop her concert tours and move to Vienna with him – which Clara interpreted as his saying her playing was no longer good and she should give up performing.\n\nThe Bremen Cathedral on Good Friday\n\nClara almost did not go, she was so hurt, and also depressed about two of her children suffering from illnesses that would kill them in a few short years. Thankfully, her daughters convinced her she should go to Bremen for the premiere anyway.\n\n“We arrived just in time for the rehearsal—Johannes was already standing at the conductor’s desk. The Requiem quite overpowered me… Johannes showed himself an excellent conductor. The work had been wonderfully studied by Reinthaler (the chorus master). In the evening, after the rehearsal, we all met together—a regular congress of artists.”\n\nClara’s diary, April 9th\n\nAt the performance, supposedly, Johannes himself walked Clara down the cathedral aisle to sit at a place of honor in the front pew—a sign of respect to her dominance in their artform, her influence on his work, and befitting a widow at her husband’s funeral.\n\n“April 10th Good Friday: Performance of the Requiem… It has taken hold of me as no sacred music ever has before… As I saw Johannes standing there, baton in hand, I could not help thinking of my dear Robert’s prophecy, ‘Let him but once grasp the magic wand and work with orchestra and chorus,’ which is fulfilled today. The baton was really a magic wand and its spell was upon all present, even upon his bitterest enemies. It was a joy such as I have not felt for a long time.”\n\nClara’s diary, April 10th Good Friday\n\nAfterward, they all went for a meal and congratulatory speeches.\n\n“After the performance there was a supper in the Rathskeller, at which everyone was jubilant—it was like a musical festival. Reinthaler made a speech about Johannes which so moved me that (unforunately!!!) I burst into tears. I thought of Robert, and what joy it would have been to him if he could have lived to see it…\n\nJohannes pressed me to stay in Bremen for another day… I wished I had not given way to him…”\n\nClara’s diary, April 10th (cont.)\n\nWhat she means by that last comment is revealed in her next letter.\n\nAfterward\n\nThe diary says later in April that Johannes was “rough and inconsiderate.” Her next letter to him explains that she was hurt when he brought up publishing Robert’s last variations, written during his hallucinations at the very end of his life. A work she considered “sacred,” was not yet ready to publish, and was angry Johannes had broken his promise not tell anyone else about them.\n\nAs he would so many other times when they argued, Johannes sent her new music as reconciliation: the final addition to the Requiem.\n\nDear Johannes, my thanks for your “Traurigkeit” comes late… I have heard so many comforting things about your “Traurigkeit” in Cologne that my consolation has become very unnecessary, but I feel compelled to say that I find the piece wonderful, both in its mood and in its artistic execution. I’m happy that it’s not missing from the Requiem and I’m not missing it from mine! Thank you again for that.\n\nClara to Johannes, May 1868\n\nWith his appeal to Clara’s weakness for beautiful music, forgiveness achieved. In the autumn, they finally managed to meet up in Vienna at the same time and give concerts together.\n\nNote: If you are researching for a publication, please credit Sarah Fritz.

Please contact claraschumannchannel [at] gmail [dot] com\n\nOne of the most searched questions about Clara is…\n\nWhat are Clara Schumann’s best works?\n\nBecause Clara was an epically self-critical composer, (famously so) she didn’t publish anything unless she knew it was good—damn good. Her standards were impossibly high, so it’s no exaggeration to say there’s greatness in all of Clara Schumann’s works.\n\nBut I’ll tell you which are her greatest, which are most famous, and which are my favorites.\n\n[This post is also a YouTube video, if you’d prefer to watch me talk. And here’s a playlist, if you wanna listen to the works in this post while reading it.]\n\nOverview of Clara Schumann’s Compositions\n\nSince most people think Clara composed little music, I’ll start with a catalogue overview. (For a full list of her compositions along with public domain scores, I always use IMSLP.)\n\nHer early works (1829-1840) were written by the young virtuoso pianist, Clara Wieck, BEFORE she married that other composer you may have heard of. Hehe.\n\nFrom her first opus at age 10 to opus 11 at age 20 – all were published under Clara Wieck. And with the exception of her opus 7, Piano Concerto, they’re all solo piano works.\n\nHer middle period (1841-1848) – published as Clara Schumann, opuses 12-17 along with others without opus – was marked by her deep dives into Beethoven sonatas, Bach fugues, and advanced counterpoint. She composed more solo piano works, two dozen lieder, preludes & fugues, a sonata, and a piano trio.\n\nHer late period (1853-1855), her final opuses 20-23, were all written during the summer of 1853. Plus, my FAVORITES, her last two romanzes without opus.\n\nIn total Clara Schumann composed over 30 works in 4 categories:\n\nSolo Piano (15 opuses total) op. 1-6 & op. 8-11 (Clara Wieck), Sonata WoO, op. 14-16, op. 21, & two romanzes without opus\n\nChamber Music – Op. 17 Trio for piano, violin, and cello; Op. 22 Romanzes for violin and piano; March for piano four hands\n\nLieder – op. 12 – 13; a dozen WoO; op. 23; Part songs without opus\n\nOrchestral Works: Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 7 (She began a second concerto in F minor, but only completed the exposition and two piano manuscript.)\n\nThere are lots of arrangements of her work—including some for choir and many orchestrated editions. (But that’s another post!) She was a great virtuoso pianist so all her works are with piano. And none of them are easy. (Sorry beginners!)\n\nSome are enjoyable for the practiced amateur to play, but most require advanced technique to master.\n\nEarly Works (1829-1840) – Clara Wieck’s Compositions\n\nThere are lots of highlights in opuses 1-5, but Clara Wieck performed the Impromptu: Le Sabbat from opus 5, Quatre Pièces Caractéristiques for years, including in Paris in 1839. A humorous, crowd pleaser with lots of virtuoso flash that was also published as Hexentanz or Witch’s Dance.\n\nHer opus 6 Notturno, written in the style of Chopin, has a hauntingly beautiful melody and some of Clara Wieck’s signature advanced harmonization. (Like a French Augmented 6th resolving to tonic. *GASP* Theory nerds will love it.)\n\nThe Mazurka in that opus 6 is one her husband and Johannes Brahms were kind of obsessed with quoting in their music.\n\nHer opus 7 PIANO CONCERTO in A minor – a work that influenced all the concertos that came after it, packed with such beauty and virtuosity, I’ve written many blog posts on it.\n\nAnd a NY Times article. Yup.\n\nBadass virtuosa, Clara Wieck, wrote more epic technical feats in her opus 8 Variations de Concert on a Bellini theme and the opus 9 Souvenir de Vienne, lovely yet masterful variations on Haydn’s hymn tune, “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser.” (A tune which got new words a few years after Clara wrote this – which in the 20th cent. became what we know as “Deutschlandlied” or the German national anthem.) Then Clara’s opus 10 Scherzo is a flashy encore (along with the Op. 14 Scherzo).\n\nHer first set of lyrical romanzes is opus 11 Trois Romances sans paroles, the transitional opus from the virtuoso to the maturing works of her…\n\nMiddle Period (1841-1848)\n\nClara Schumann stepped away from flashy virtuoso works and did intensive study into Bach and Beethoven, sonata form and advanced counterpoint. She wrote works like her Piano Sonata in G minor that went unpublished & unperformed until the 1990s!\n\nShe took up song writing and wrote some of the best Lieder in the repertoire like Liebst du um Schönheit. (If you like her husband’s Widmung, you’ll LOVE this one.) And my personal favorite, Die Lorelei, packed with references to Schubert’s Erlkonig. Plus her opus 13 Sechs Lieder is a seamless song cycle.\n\nShe mastered writing Bach-style fugues and advanced counterpoint to write her op. 16 Preludes and Fugues. Then Clara wrote her pinnacle 4-movement work, her Piano Trio in G minor that’s been recorded by the Beaux Art Trio AND a new recording with Anne Sophie Mutter. (Definitely listen to those!)\n\nBut then, for 7 years, Clara Schumann published nothing, and she feared her composing days were over. Until…\n\nThe Late Works of Clara Schumann (1853-1855)\n\nIn 1853, Clara and Robert were finally able to afford an apartment large enough that Clara could have her own study on the second floor. Where she could play all day without disturbing Robert’s composing, for the first time in her 14-year marriage… YIKES!\n\n[I wrote about why and how messed up that was here.]\n\nBUT thanks to that little study—a room of her own—in one summer, Clara Schumann wrote her final opuses 20-23.\n\nHer opus 20 variations on her husband’s theme, Johannes Brahms loved so much, he made his own version. Her opus 21 Romanzes for solo piano, the first is her most dissonant work, full of heart wrenching chromaticism. Her opus 22 Romanzes for violin and piano were inspired by and dedicated to her favorite chamber music partner, the great violinist and composer, Josef Joachim. Her last song cycle, her op. 23 Jucunde Songs, were written on poems from a novel by the political poet, Rollett.\n\nThe Last Romanzes Without Opus\n\nHer last two compositions—Romanze in A minor and Romanze in B minor Without Opus—are two of my favorite pieces in all of music. IMO some of the most beautiful, heartbreaking music ever written. The second, the B minor Romanze, was composed as a gift for Johannes Brahms.\n\nThey’re mournful, sad, heartbreaking pieces. You can hear how her husband was sick and dying. They inspired some of Johannes’s intermezzos 50 yrs later.\n\n(If I had my way, these two romanzes would be as famous and well-known as Johannes’s most popular intermezzos. That’s where they sit in my heart.)\n\nWhen Robert died in 1856, Clara stopped composing. Why? Partly because she was heartbroken but also because…\n\nWhy did Clara Schumann stop composing?\n\nShe had 7 kids to support as a single parent at age 36. She gave concert tours for 40 more years to support her family. And changed the repertoire and concert tradition to what we have today!\n\nSo now you know some of the greatest works by Clara Wieck-Schumann.\n\nAnd this is only scratching the surface…\n\nYou can listen to all these works in this playlist. And you can find the music scores in public domain on IMSLP."
