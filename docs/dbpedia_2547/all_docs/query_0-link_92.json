        "text": "From Hymn melodies for the whole year from the Sarum Service-books:\n\nOn the Feast of S. Mary Magdalene (July 22) :\n\n1st Evensong: Collaudemus Magdalene ... ... ... 45\n\nMattins: Estimavit hortolanum ... ... ... 67\n\nLauds & 2nd Ev.: Maria, noli flere ... ... ... 45\n\nOnce again, I have written on this feast day previously (also here, where you can listen to an Orthodox Communion hymn for this feast), but with this post I am looking to complete my Sarum hymn listings specifically. Follow along with the full office here, at Breviary Offices, from Lauds to Compline Inclusive (Society of St. Margaret, Boston, 1885). I'll link-in via iFrame at the bottom of the post too.\n\nMelody #45 is the same tune used for Urbs Beata Ierusalem and Angulare Fundamentum, sung On the Feast of the Dedication of a Church; Oremus hymnal online has a midi of the plainsong. It's a pretty and distinctive tune.\n\nThis melody is also used on several other \"Proper of Saints'\" days: at Visitation, on \"The Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross\" (on May 3 - and not the same holiday as the September 14 \"Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross\"), and on the Feast of \"S. Vincent M.\" That's an interesting group of days! I'm going to try to learn more about this; I wonder especially if this melody has been over the centuries closely associated with Urbs Beata Ierusalem and Angulare Fundamentum - and whether or not those hymns (and thus this melody) had special resonance in the minds of Christians. Obviously, UBI and AF are hymns that call to mind the church itself; you find them in the \"Church\" section of the 1982 hymnal under their current incarnations, \"Blessed City, Heavenly Salem\" and \"Christ is made the sure foundation.\" I've heard the latter hymn in particular used at ordinations and at other special occasional ecclesial celebrations; they are definitely associated in my mind with the church itself. So I'm wondering how all that relates to the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene; I'm going to see what I can find out.\n\nThere are two versions of \"Blessed City, Heavenly Salem\" in the 1982 Hymnal, and one of them - Hymn #519 - uses the original plainchant melody.\n\nMelody #67 is the same one used for Tibi, Christe, Splendor Patris on the Feast of St. Michael and All Angels:\n\nHere's G. Vianini's version of Tibi, Christe, Splendor Patris, sung to this melody:\n\nThese seem to be obscure hymns, and it was quite difficult to find out much about them. Then the 1902 book, Description and History of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Munster Square, London, came to the rescue. The book contains English translations of two of the hymns: Collaudemus Magdalene and Maria, noli flere - as well as a few others. I'm including all five hymns from the book here, just for the interest value; Collaudemus Magdalene and Maria, noli flere are #s III and IV below. I find the text of Maria, noli flere to be especially beautiful; the mystical \"Gardener of the thirsty mind\" image is astonishing!\n\nHYMNS FOR ST. MARY MAGDALENE'S DAY,\n\nOF THE XI., XII., XIV., AND XVII. CENTURIES.\n\nI. LAUDA MATER ECCLESIA.\n\nNow let the Church in earth and heav'n\n\nTo Christ upraise her melody:\n\nBy sev'nfold grace from devils sev'n\n\nA captive soul is now set free.\n\nFull oft she sinned of whom we tell,\n\nMary, the sister of Lazarus;\n\nWho, from the very jaws of hell,\n\nRepentant life hath shewn to us.\n\nTo Christ the Healer see her go,\n\nWith precious ointment for her Lord:\n\nThe Good Physician speaks, and lo!\n\nHe heals her sickness by His Word.\n\nO unction from a broken heart!\n\nO rivers from those laden eyes'!\n\nSuch choosing of love's better part\n\nBrings pardon with a glad surprise.\n\nThis loving Saint was first to see\n\nThe Victor, rising from His rest:\n\nThe earliest joy was hers to be\n\nWho loved Him most, who loved the best.\n\nNow God in mercy grant to us,\n\nIn life's incessant storms and cares,\n\nThat all the Saints most glorious\n\nMay aid us sinners with their prayers.\n\nTo God Alone be glory giv'n,\n\nFor sev'n-fold pow'r and glad release:\n\nTo souls of men, from sin forgiv'n,\n\nHe gives new life and joy and peace.\n\n(S. Odo of Cluny, 11th Century-)\n\nII.âMANE PRIMA SABBATI.\n\nDawning was the first of days,\n\nWhen from death our Hope and Praise,\n\nSon of God rose gloriously;\n\nTrampling down the infernal King,\n\nPower of darkness vanquishing,\n\nForth He came 'victoriously.\n\nWhen the risen Lord was seen,\n\nBlessed Mary Magdalen\n\nWas the herald whom He chose,\n\nNews of promised joy to bring\n\nTo His brethren sorrowing\n\nO'er their Master's dying throes.\n\nO thrice blessed eyes that first,\n\n(When the chains of death were ourst,\n\nSin destroy'd and Satan quell'd),\n\nChrist, the King of all, beheld.\n\nThis was she who was of old\n\nLost in sin so manifold,\n\nBut at Jesus' feet obtain'd\n\nGrace to pardon all that stain'd.\n\nMutely suing, grief renewing,\n\nLo! she proveth how she loveth\n\nChrist supremely, by her tears;\n\nWhen adoring and imploring,\n\nHe regardeth and rewardeth,\n\nStilling self-accusing fears.\n\nMary sweetest! as is meetest,\n\nFor thy holy deeds and lowly,\n\nThee we hail as \"Ocean Star \";\n\nName thou bearest which thou sharest\n\nWith that other blessed Mother\n\nWho in rank outshines thee far.\n\nOne a queenly title gaineth,\n\nOne, a sinner, grace obtaineth;\n\nEach upon the Church's night\n\nHeralded returning light.\n\nOne the Gate whereby Salvation\n\nDawn'd amain on all creation;\n\nThe other world-wide bliss restored\n\nAnd blazon'd forth the risen Lord.\n\nMagdalen! our praises heeding,\n\nAid our vows by interceding,\n\nO befriend us and commend us\n\nAt the throne of Christ above!\n\nThat the Fount of Expiation\n\nWho effaced her degradation,\n\nReconcilement from defilement\n\nMay vouchsafe us in His love.\n\n(Sarum Gradual, 11th Century.)\n\n111.âCOLLAUDEMUS MAGDALENE.\n\nSing we now the praise of Mary,\n\nAll her tears, her joy, her love;\n\nHigh in laud we raise our voices,\n\nWhile our hearts in concert move;\n\nSo the nightingale descanteth\n\nSweetly to the plaintive dove.\n\nNought the number of the feasters,\n\nSeeking Jesus, did she fear;\n\nShe her Master's feet anointed,\n\nWash'd them with the falling tear,\n\nWiped them with her tresses, gaining\n\nPardon through her love sincere.\n\nLo, the cleans'd doth wash the Cleanser,\n\nStream to Fountain floweth fain;\n\nBalm that from the flower distilleth,\n\nFragrance sheds on flower again;\n\nAnd the dew from earth ascendeth\n\nTo the heav'n that gave the rain.\n\nSpikenard in the alabaster\n\nIs her offering pure and rare;\n\nShe, in pouring of the ointment,\n\nDoth a mystic sign declare;\n\nSick, anointeth her Physician,\n\nTo receive His healing care.\n\nGazed the Lord with special favour\n\nDown on Mary tenderly;\n\nMuch she loves; her sins, though many,\n\nHave forgiveness full and free;\n\nOn the Resurrection-morning\n\nShe shall Jesus' herald be.\n\nGlory be to God, and honour,\n\nWho, true Paschal Sacrifice,\n\nLamb in death, in strife a Lion,\n\nDid the third day Victor rise,\n\nAnd the spoils of death, as trophies,\n\nBare triumphant to the skies.\n\n(Sarum Breviary, 14fh Century.)\n\nIV. MARIA, NOLI FLERE.\n\nWeep not, Mary, weep no longer,\n\nNor another seek to find:\n\nHere indeed the Gardener standeth,\n\nGardener of the thirsty mind.\n\nIn the spirit's inner garden\n\nSeek that Gardener ever kind.\n\nWhence thy grief and lamentation?\n\nLift, faint soul, thy heart on high,\n\nSeek not memory's consolation,\n\nJesus Whom thou lov'st is nigh;\n\nDost thou seek the Lord? thou hast Him,\n\nThough unseen by human eye.\n\nWhence thy sorrow, whence thy weeping?\n\nTrue the joy thou hast within;\n\nUndiscerned abides within thee\n\nBalm to heal the wounds of sin;\n\n'Tis within, why, vainly roving,\n\nSeek disease's medicine?\n\n'Tis no wonder if thy Master\n\nPass thy knowledge while He sows;\n\nFor His seed, the word eternal,\n\nUnto fulness in thee grows;\n\n\"Mary,\" saith Heâthou, \" Rabboni,\"â\n\nAnd the soul her Saviour knows.\n\nThou didst wash the feet of Jesus,\n\nThee the Fount of grace did lave;\n\nMay we, by that dew's refreshment,\n\nWhich to thee remission gave,\n\nShare His glory, Whom thou sawest,\n\nRisen a Victor from the grave.\n\n(Sarum Breviary, 14th Century.)\n\nV. MARY MAGDALENE.\n\nWhen blessed Mary wip'd her Saviour's feet,\n\n(Whose precepts she had trampled on before)\n\nAnd wore them for a jewel on her head,\n\nShewing His steps should be the street,\n\nWherein she henceforth evermore\n\nWith pensive humbleness would live and tread:\n\nShe being stain'd herself, why did she strive\n\nTo make Him clean, Who could not be defil'd;\n\nWhy kept she not her tears for her own faults,\n\nAnd not His feet? Though we could dive\n\nIn tears like seas, our sins are pil'd\n\nDeeper than they, in words, and works, and thoughts.\n\nDear soul, she knew Who did vouchsafe and deign\n\nTo bear her filth; and that her sins did dash\n\nEv'n God Himself: wherefore she was not loth,\n\nAs she had brought wherewith to stain,\n\nSo to bring in wherewith to wash:\n\nAnd yet in washing one, she washed both.\n\n(George Herbert, 1633)\n\nI was also able to find the Mattins hymn, Estimavit Hortolanum, in the book Medieval Hymns and Sequences; it's another Magdalene hymn based on the Gardener motif. Here's the full entry; sing it to melody #67, as prescribed above:\n\nAestimabit Hortolanum\n\nThe very elegant hymn, Pange lingua Magdalenae, of English origin, is in the Sarum Breviary divided into three, for Vespers, Matins, and Lauds. I translated it for the Hymnal Noted; but it was thought too complex for popular use. The Lauds hymn was accidentally kept: the other translations lost. It is in the Clewer edition of the Day Hours.\n\nAs the Gardener, Him addressing,\n\nWell and rightly she believ'd:\n\nHe, the Sower, gave His blessing\n\nTo the seed her heart receiv'd:\n\nNot at first His Form confessing,\n\nSoon His Voice her soul perceiv'd.\n\nShe beheld, as yet not knowing\n\nIn the mystical disguise,\n\nChrist, That in her breast was sowing\n\nDeep and heavenly mysteries:\n\nTill His Voice, her name bestowing,\n\nBade her hear and recognize.\n\nShe to Jesus, Jesus weepeth,\n\nOf her Lord removed complains;\n\nJesus in her breast she keepeth;\n\nJesus seeks, yet still retains:\n\nHe That soweth, He That reapeth\n\nAll her heart, unknown remains.\n\nWhy, kind Jesu, why thus hiding,\n\nWhen Thyself Thou would'st reveal?\n\nWhy, in Mary's breast abiding,\n\nFrom her love Thyself conceal?\n\nWhy, True Light, in her residing,\n\nCan she not Its radiance feel?\n\nOh, how strangely Thou eludest\n\nSouls that on Thee have believ'd!\n\nBut eluding, ne'er deludest,\n\nNor deceiv'st, nor art deceiv'd;\n\nBut including, still excludest;\n\nFully known, yet not perceiv'd.\n\nLaud to Thee and praise for ever,\n\nLife, Hope, Light of every soul!\n\nThrough Thy merits may we never\n\nBe inscribed in Death's dark roll,\n\nBut with Mary's true endeavour\n\nAll our sins, like her, condole! Amen.\n\nHere's a peek-in to the SSM Breviary entry:\n\nThe foundation stone of St. Mary Magdalene Munster Square was laid in 1849; the church's founder was influenced by the Oxford Movement of the 19th Century.\n\nHere are a few images from their Gallery page:\n\nBelow I've included a big chunk of the book's \"History of the Church\" chapter; I wanted to see how and why Mary Magdalene was chosen as the name for the parish, but so far haven't discovered this.\n\nAbsence of a Church in any district is certain to ensure the deterioration of the neighbourhood at no very distant date. On the other hand, the provision of a dignified Church in any locality greatly improves the surrounding vicinity. This statement is borne out in a remarkable degree in the history of St. Mary Magdalene's.\n\nWhen London, in Georgian days, gradually extended its borders and spread further afield, Osnaburgh Street and Munster Square with the surrounding property, were built (c.1810) in a substantial style. Osnaburgh Street, and others near by, were provided with stables to each house, and it appears that the inhabitants at first were people of means and some position. Like all newly built-on districts, it retained, too, some of its rural surroundings for a considerable period. The country was not nearly so far away then as now, and the village pound and village pond of St. Pancras were still on the sites of Holy Trinity Church and Portland Road Station, even within the memory of people still alive. But no Church accommodation of any description was provided for many years, and the area with all these additional rows of houses continued part of the gigantic parish of St. Pancras. It is evident that it was, moreover, recognised, even in those apathetic days, that the parish had outgrown the accommodation of the original little Church of St. Pancras, since, in 1819, the then Duke of York laid the foundation stone of the new Church, as we know it now, which was consecrated in 1822.\n\nIn 1818 Dr. Blomfield had been appointed Bishop of London, and he devoted himself very largely to increasing the number of Churches in his Diocese. With this object he founded the Metropolis Church Scheme, which had for its object the building of Churches in London, where the Church accommodation was ridiculously small in proportion to the ever-increasing population.\n\nChrist Church, Albany Street, was the first Church built by this scheme, and was finished in 1837. It was to Christ Church that Mr. Stuart used every Sunday to go for his eight o'clock Communion, when staying with his father in Harley Street during the Oxford vacations, and whenever he went there he always dropped a piece of gold into the box, \" For the Building of the New Church,\" which subsequently formed the nucleus of the fund for purchasing the site of St. Mary Magdalene's.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Eton, and at Baliol College and New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he came under the influence of Dr. Pusey, he took his degree, and in about 1845 he was ordained, Mr. Wardell of Winlaton, in the Diocese of Durham, giving him a title. He next became an assistant-priest to Mr. Powell, of Cirencester, and afterwards he volunteered to assist Mr. Edward Munro in carrying on the College, which he had founded for the higher education of boys of the lower middle-class.\n\nHe then joined Mr. Dodsworth's staff at Christ Church, Albany Street, and while there he conceived the idea of devoting himself and his fortune to what eventually became his life's work, at St. Mary Magdalene's. It is said that he offered the Bishop of London to found a Church and to serve it in such part of London as had the most evil reputation, and the Bishop indicated the then York Square neighbourhood. He may possibly have also been influenced in his choice by Dr. Pusey, who was well acquainted with its terrible condition.\n\nFor all the forty or so years since the houses had been built, no Church had yet been erected within sight, and the neighbourhood had deteriorated rapidly. The proximity of the barracks, situated at the back of Cumberland Terrace, had also tended to lower the tone of the inhabitants. The result was that no respectable people would take a house in York Square, on account of the stigma attached to any one dwelling there.\n\nIt is typical of the man that Mr. Stuart not only sold his estate to pay the entire cost of the Church, and for its endowment, but he himself took a house in the notorious square itself as his own residence.\n\nThe site of the Church was originally occupied by a coach factory, and the site having been provided, as before indicated, by the congregation of Christ Church, the foundation stone was laid on July ioth, 1849, by Mr. Baron Alderson, an old friend of Mr. Stuart's.\n\nThe Holy Eucharist was celebrated in Christ Church, and the service was fully choral, five choirs combining to give effect to its performance, viz., those of St. Andrew's, Wells Street, Margaret Chapel, a selection from St. Mark's College, the boys of the Chapel Royal, St. James', and the regular cboir of Christ Church. They were conducted by the Rev. T. Helmore, whose Psalter (Noted) was used for the Psalms, which were chanted antiphonally by priest and choir. The Rev. John Keble preached the sermon. . After the Service, a procession was formed to proceed to the site, consisting of about seventy surpliced Priests and a surpliced Choir of eighty, followed by the greater part of the congregation. The service of the laying of the stone included two sets of Versiclesâcommencing respectively, \"O how amiable are Thy dwellings,\" and \"Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious,\" the 8410 and 127th Psalms, sung to grand old Gregorian tunes, and prayers, including one for consecration of the stone. The stone was then formally laid, and an anthem followed. The blessing, pronounced by Mr. Dodsworth, concluded the ceremony. The procession then returned to Christ Church in the same order, and a banquet subsequently took place the same day.\n\nThe building of the Church, however, occupied a longer time than had originally been expected on account of difficulties with the foundations, but in three years the first part of the Church was ready for consecration, and on April 22nd, 1852, the Church of St. Mary Magdalene was consecrated by Bishop Blomfield, and the following, in the handwriting of Mr. Stuart, is the earliest entry from the Parish Book :â\n\n\"The Right Rev. Lord Bishop of London consecrated the Church of St. Mary Magdalene on this day. Messrs. Holland and Charrington, parishioners of the new District Parish, with the Rev. Edw. Stuart, Perpetual Curate, presented the petition for consecration.\n\n\"The Prayers were said by the Rev. E. Stuart; the Lessons were read by the Rev. M. Shaw, and Rev. W. F. Powell, of Cirencester. The Epistle was read by the Rev. W. F. Burrows, and Holy Communion was administered by the Bishop, assisted by the Rev. E. Stuart, Rev. W. F. Burrows, and Rev. J. W. Molyneux, Assistant Curate of St. Mary Magdalene's, to 300 communicants.\n\n\"The Sermon was preached by the Bishop of London, and the offertory, amounting to ^190, was set aside for the building of Schools in the new District.\n\n\"In the evening there was Service at seven o'clock, after which a Sermon was preached by the Rev. F. D. Maurice, Professor of King's College.\"\n\nIt may be mentioned in passing that the anomalous title of \"Perpetual Curate,\" which was shared with the incumbent of Christ Church, Albany Street, and many other comparatively recently erected churches, and new districts, was altered to that of Vicar by the passing, in i860, of the Marquis of Blandford's Act.\n\nThus began the actual history of the Church, the Jubilee of which we have been spared to keep this year (1902). How far reaching may be the results of the single-hearted labours of Mr. Stuart and those others who have ministered and laboured at St. Mary Magdalene's, no man can tell. It is sufficient for us to know that the whole moral tone of the Parish was visibly improved even before Mr. Stuart's death, and the improvement has continued ever since.\n\nThe lines on which Mr. Stuart worked to attain this end and in which he has been followed by his successors, were to make the word Thorough the motto of the Church, and this single word best sums up his own life and teaching, as well as the Church and the services.\n\nAnd he was not afraid to adopt such practices of the Roman branch of the Catholic Church as were fit and edifying, leaving them the \"monopoly,\" as he was wont to write, of compulsory confession, of compulsory celibacy, of miraculous images, and of prayers in Latin. He also strongly championed the voluntary use of private confession in both his teaching and writings. He always insisted, however, on having the congregation with him before he added to the ceremonial or otherwise altered the services. For this purpose he preached on Vestments, Incense, or whatever it. might be, before introducing them, besides writing pamphlets and leaflets with the same object. He also compiled a Hymn-book at a time when the paraphrased versions of the Psalms were almost the only metrical songs used in Churches. Several of these hymns are now -included in the new Hymn-books now in use in the Church. He made the Services and Music bright, congregational, and hearty. One of the customs he borrowed from abroad was that of Open-air Processions, on the greater festivals, in addition to those in the Church. In these he introduced girls in white, with different coloured scarves, as well as the regular choir with the banners of the Church. He admitted that such processions were then (1873) unusual, but hoped that would not be the case much longer. He further justified the proceedings in a tract he published at the time by appealing to common sense and to Biblical tradition, as well as similar efforts of dissenters and others.\n\nAt Christmas, Good Friday, Easter, and Whitsun, he always circulated leaflets, the specimens of which, with the extracts from his other writings on pages 48 to 50 will suffice to show the type of the man, and the direct clearness of his teaching.\n\nIn his social work he was as conspicuous as a pioneer as in the services. The Christmas dinners and presents, treats to the children of the schools, their parents, and poor people generally, have always been one of the traditions of the parish. For many years, too, he held annual summer excursions to Rye House, charging the participants one shilling each all round towards their share of the day's expenses, people in better positions being invited to increase their contribution. As far back as 1855 he formulated the rules for St. Mary Magdalene's Club, which was most successful, and in whichâas in all the work connected with the Churchâhe took a great personal interest, and towards the success of which he devoted several hours of his own spare time each week. This social side languished somewhat at the time of his death, but was revived by Mr. Ponsonby, and is now succeeded\n\nhoping that a good Vicarage house would be handed over to his successors free of debt. The corner stone was laid on the morrow of St. Mary Magdalene's Day, 1895, and the house was first occupied in 1896.\n\nMr. Hitchcock's health was not very good, and after a voyage to the Cape had not done all the good that was expected, it became necessary for him to resign. The Rev. W. H. Jervois, who had been assistant priest for five years at St. Giles's, Reading (Mr. Ponsonby's original parish), and twelve years at St. Matthew's, Westminster, was appointed Vicar in 1896, by the Bishop (Temple) of London, to whom the patronage had fallen by the original settlement.\n\nDuring the past six years the schools have been enlarged, the new Institute has been opened, the congregation has become more parochial, and thus the Church has started on the second half-century of her work.\n\nThe Church's work, whether in general or in any individual parish, must be one of faith, always certain of her divine commission and the divine promises, always looking upward, always confident, always content to leave results in the hands of God. The time will come when the densely populated area bounded by Euston Road, Hampstead Road, and Drummond Street will be annexed to the parish, bringing with it a large increase of responsibility and an imperative call for fresh effort; it is therefore necessary from a purely human point of view to put forth our best energies now on behalf of the present population to bring home to them the Catholic Faith, and so to make them \"workers together with God,\" at least by their example of Christian living.\n\nThere are many things still wanting to complete the Church, particulars of which will be found elsewhere, but these notes will indicate what has, by the grace of God, been accomplished in the past, and assuredly we mayitook forward to like blessings in the time to come."
