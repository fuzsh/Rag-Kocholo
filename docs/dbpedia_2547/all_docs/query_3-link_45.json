        "text": "“Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven devils had been cast out”\n\nLuke 8:2.\n\nThe first was that I was very busy.\n\nThe second—I was different from you: whatever happened to you could\n\nnot happen to me, not like that.\n\nThe third—I worried.\n\nThe fourth—envy, disguised as compassion.\n\nThe fifth was that I refused to consider the quality of life of the aphid,\n\nThe aphid disgusted me. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.\n\nThe mosquito too—its face. And the ant—its bifurcated body.\n\nOk the first was that I was so busy.\n\nThe second that I might make the wrong choice,\n\nbecause I had decided to take that plane that day,\n\nthat flight, before noon, so as to arrive early\n\nand, I shouldn’t have wanted that.\n\nThe third was that if I walked past the certain place on the street\n\nthe house would blow up.\n\nThe fourth was that I was made of guts and blood with a thin layer\n\nof skin lightly thrown over the whole thing.\n\nThe fifth was that the dead seemed more alive to me than the living\n\nThe sixth—if I touched my right arm I had to touch my left arm, and if I\n\ntouched the left arm a little harder than I’d first touched the right then I had\n\nto retouch the left and then touch the right again so it would be even.\n\nThe seventh—I knew I was breathing the expelled breath of everything that\n\nwas alive, and I couldn’t stand it.\n\nI wanted a sieve, a mask, a, I hate this word—cheesecloth—\n\nto breath through that would trap it—whatever was inside everyone else that\n\nentered me when I breathed in.\n\nNo. That was the first one.\n\nThe second was that I was so busy. I had no time. How had this happened?\n\nHow had our lives gotten like this?\n\nThe third was that I couldn’t eat food if I really saw it—distinct, separate\n\nfrom me in a bowl or on a plate.\n\nOk. The first was that. I could never get to the end of the list.\n\nThe second was that the laundry was never finally done.\n\nThe third was that no one knew me, although they thought they did.\n\nAnd that if people thought of me as little as I thought of them then what was\n\nlove?\n\nThe fourth was I didn’t belong to anyone. I wouldn’t allow myself to belong\n\nto anyone.\n\nThe fifth was that I knew none of us could ever know what we didn’t know.\n\nThe sixth was that I projected onto others what I myself was feeling.\n\nThe seventh was the way my mother looked when she was dying,\n\nthe sound she made—her mouth wrenched to the right and cupped open\n\nso as to take in as much air… the gurgling sound, so loud\n\nwe had to speak louder to hear each other over it.\n\nAnd that I couldn’t stop hearing it—years later—grocery shopping, crossing the street—\n\nNo, not the sound—it was her body’s hunger\n\nfinally evident—what our mother had hidden all her life.\n\nFor months I dreamt of knucklebones and roots,\n\nthe slabs of sidewalk pushed up like crooked teeth by what grew underneath."
