        "text": "Obvious though it may seem, it is easy to forget that, both as a composer and as a teacher, Jules Massenet (1842-1912) had a profound influence on French music.\n\nRather reserved by nature and not one to engage in polemics in the media arena, Jules Massenet does not immediately stand out as a pioneer in the field of music or as a theorist of operatic reform. The sign of a certain wisdom, a decision to focus his efforts on composition, the composer’s moderation may also be explained by the fact that he attained key positions in French musical life at quite an early age. There was no point in criticising his contemporaries when he held the most prestigious positions – professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire and member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts at the age of thirty-six – and when his works were internationally successful. To understand Massenet’s aesthetics, we only have to listen to his works and those of his students. Taking care to avoid repetition by varying his choice of subject – fantasy, fairy-tale, classical myth, the medieval, the exotic, and so on – he constantly provided the major European stages with ambitious works. He also trained a generation of artists who were long to remain grateful to him: Gabriel Pierné, Xavier Leroux, Gustave Charpentier, Augustin Savard, the brothers Paul and Lucien Hillemacher, Alfred Bruneau, Paul Vidal, Reynaldo Hahn, Henry Février and Florent Schmitt were among the many artists who took their master’s vision into the heart of the twentieth century.\n\nThe high road\n\nMassenet came from a relatively privileged background and his conscientiousness in his studies stood him in good stead. He received his first piano lessons from his mother and entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1853. He was awarded the premier prix for piano at the age of seventeen, went on to study in the music theory class, and embarked on a career as a virtuoso concert pianist, while acting as supernumerary timpanist at the Théâtre-Lyrique. In 1863 he was awarded the premier prix for counterpoint and fugue, and the same year, studying composition with Ambroise Thomas, he won the Conservatoire’s top musical honour, the Prix de Rome. On his return from the three statutory years at the Villa Medici, he was commissioned to write his first opéra-comique (La Grand’ Tante), but he did not immediately devote himself exclusively to opera. During the 1870s, he was a founding member of the Société Nationale de Musique (which promoted French music and enabled rising composers to present their works in public), and there he distinguished himself both as a composer and as an accompanying pianist. He also showed an interest in the composition of orchestral works and hybrid forms; in 1873 he composed the oratorio ('drame sacré') Marie-Magdeleine and the incidental music to Leconte de Lisle’s verse drama Les Érinnyes (1873); another oratorio (this time entitled 'mystère'), Ève, followed in 1875. The success of Le Roi de Lahore at the Paris Opéra in 1877 made him the leading composer of opera in France, and the following year he attained the highest of academic honours when, on the death of François Bazin, he was appointed to take his seat at the Académie des Beaux-Arts (one of the academies of the Institut de France). He was only thirty-six years old. France, then in search of new heroes capable of countering Wagner’s influence on European music, naturally turned to Massenet.\n\nA successful teacher\n\nIn the year of his election to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, Massenet also joined the Paris Conservatoire as professor of composition, again replacing François Bazin. Ambroise Thomas, who had been his teacher, was by then the director of the Paris Conservatoire and he proved innovative in his running of the institution. Classes in music history (1871) and orchestration (1873) were introduced, and the concerts known as 'exercices publics', giving students exposure to the real world of public performance, once again became important events in the Parisian calendar. To this policy of opening up the establishment to the contemporary artistic world, Massenet contributed his expertise as a successful composer. His pupils witnessed the triumph of Hérodiade (1881), Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). And as a teacher he passed on his success; indeed, most of the winners of the Prix de Rome were students of his: Lucien Hillemacher, Georges Marty, Paul Vidal, Xavier Leroux, Augustin Savard, Gustave Charpentier, Charles Silver, André Bloch, Henri Rabaud, Max d’Ollone, Florent Schmitt, to which prestigious list may be added the names of Alfred Bruneau, Reynaldo Hahn and Raoul Laparra, for whom Massenet’s teaching was extended to include guidance on how to achieve success on the capital’s opera stages. On the death of Ambroise Thomas in 1896, Massenet was offered the directorship, but he decided to turn away from the Conservatoire. 'Free at last and forever rid of [his] chains' (Mes Souvenirs), henceforth he was able to devote himself entirely to composing for the theatre."
