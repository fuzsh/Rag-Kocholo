        "text": "It seemed like quite a while since I had settled down with a Persephone book, and so reading this one felt like quite a treat. After a good Christmas haul, I have now amassed a lovely little pile of unread Persephone books to add to my enormous collection of already read Persephone books.\n\nThe New Magdalen by Wilkie Collins might seem like a surprising addition to the Persephone list, but it isn’t really. Wilkie Collins was a man ahead of his time in his attitudes to society and women – and he was often angered by the injustices that he saw around him. I read a lot of Wilkie Collins about thirty years ago, and The New Magdalen was one I had read before, I had retained some memory of it, but little of the detail. It is of course from the genre called the sensation novel – and is a great page turner.\n\nThe novel centres on Mercy Merrick a young ‘fallen’ woman, as the society of that time would have judged her – who sets about trying to rehabilitate her character, and reputation in an unforgiving society. She sees her chance and takes it – but nothing is ever as simple as that.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the sensation novel, then you’ll know the kind of thing you’re going to get. It’s a very particular kind of storytelling, quite different from modern novels, but in that it does provide a degree of escapism, which I appreciated. The world of the sensation novel is small and full of coincidences. This is necessary for the plot to move along at the cracking pace that it does, so the modern reader needs to let go of that inner cynic that is apt to cry “really!” So, a principle character only needs to sit and idly remember someone they once loved/met/was inspired by and the reader knows that person will be turning up soon, and anyone they meet in one place will be part of the family or social circle they settle into later.\n\nMercy Merrick has had a difficult life already when we first meet her, one that had led her to a refuge for fallen women in London. Each time she has begun a new life, a new job, someone finds out about her past and it all comes crashing down.\n\n“For three years past all that a sincerely penitent woman can do I have done. It doesn’t matter. Once let my past story be known, and the shadow of it covers me: the kindest people shrink”\n\nHaving left the refuge again, Mercy is now working as a nurse in France during the Franco-Prussian war. As the novel opens Mercy is sheltering in a small cottage, as the French and Germans close by try to blow each other to pieces. With her in the cottage is a French officer, a surgeon some wounded men and another young woman in need of shelter. Grace Roseberry is on her way from Canada to England. English born, she hasn’t been back since she was a child, and now with her father recently dead, she has no one in the world. She is however carrying letters of introduction from her father to a Lady Janet Roy – who Grace hopes will take her in, and employ her as a companion in her large London mansion. Grace confides all of this to Mercy as they sit waiting for the crisis to end. However, the cottage is badly shelled, and Grace takes a direct hit.\n\nMercy takes her chance – in terrible fear of being discovered, but desperate for a chance, she swaps places with Grace Roseberry, who lies lifeless in a French cottage. She takes Graces clothes, the precious papers and calling herself by the name Grace Roseberry she makes her way to England and to the home of Lady Janet Roy.\n\n“To the mistress of the house, and to all who inhabit it or enter it, she is known as Grace Roseberry, the orphan relative by marriage of Lady Janet Roy. To herself alone she is known as the outcast of the London streets; the inmate of the London Refuge; the lost young woman who has stolen her way back – after vainly trying to fight her way back – to Home and Name. There she sits in the grim shadow of her own terrible secret, disguised in another person’s identity, and established in another person’s place. Mercy Merrick had only to dare, and to become Grace Roseberry if she pleased. She has dared, and she has been Grace Roseberry for nearly four months past.”\n\nAlthough she has had a difficult life, and has now entered into a fraud, Mercy is a good woman, the reader knows this immediately, Mercy is constantly conflicted by what she is done, and grateful for everything that comes after. Lady Janet takes her in, gives her a home, employs her as a companion, and soon starts calling Mercy her adopted daughter. One of the men who helped liberate her from the cottage is Horace, a friend of Lady Janet’s and is clearly smitten with Mercy, and is soon asking her to marry him. Lady Janet’s nephew Julian is a clergyman, a man with a strong social conscience he is often out of step with the narrow, thinking of the society in which he lives. Mercy once heard him speak, while she was still at the refuge and has never forgotten him. Julian is also deeply affected by Mercy. Julian has been contacted by someone asking him for help, a young woman is in need of assistance after being caught up in the war in France and terribly injured.\n\nFor Grace Roseberry hadn’t been killed, she had been terribly injured and it has taken a long time for her to be recovered enough to travel to England. She is full of anger, looking for revenge desperate to right the wrong she realises has been done to her. She is proud and in no mood for forgiveness or charity. I’m sure it is no coincidence that one of these women is called Mercy and the other Grace, for one of them has both these attributes, and one of them has neither.\n\nThe New Magdalen is definitely in the thumping good read category of novels. Great page turning escapism and a story that reveals all those anxieties that people of the Victorian era held – anxieties which resonate still, even in 2022."
