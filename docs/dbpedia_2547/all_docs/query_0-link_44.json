        "text": "All photographs by Wojciech Grzędziński / NIFC\n\nTuesday 31.08.21 18:00\n\nMoniuszko Hall of the Teatr Wielki – Polish National Opera\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nAnd so we arrive at the final concert of this remarkable Festival, Chopin and His Europe 2021. It has been a long and winding road of the most exquisite musical pleasures and some occasional bathos. The Artistic Director Stanisław Leszczyński is to be congratulated once again on his unstinting efforts to 'keep the show on the road', especially in the face of the pandemic which has so curtailed international travel for artists.\n\nAs a 'foreign critic' I find the international publicity restrictions in Poland a severely limiting cultural barrier of the most unfortunate kind, especially in view of the Polish musical renaissance now in progress. There is in progress a rich rediscovery of Polish Early Music, Baroque, Classical and Romantic - the reason I keep this Reviewer's Notebook in English.\n\nOther musical festivals in Poland suffer from the same fate of ignorance abroad of what is actually taking place here musically. The remarkable Actus Humanus in Gdańsk, the superb Wrocław Cantans, the Bach Festival in Świdnica, the International Chopin Festival in Duszniki Zdrój, the Warsaw Autumn Contemporary Music Festival to name only the most outstanding. Well, I do what I can...\n\nDorothee Mields soprano\n\nKrešimir Stražanac baritone\n\nPhilippe Herreweghe conductor\n\nCollegium Vocale Gent\n\nThe Orchestre des Champs-Élysées\n\nGabriel Fauré\n\nRequiem, Op. 48\n\nFauré wrote of the work:\n\n'Everything I managed to entertain by way of religious illusion I put into my Requiem, which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest.' He also said after many years as an organist accompanying funerals and requiems, he said his goal in this composition was was '...to stray from the established path after all those years accompanying funerals! I’d had them up to here. I wanted to do something different.'\n\nThese sentiments were encapsulated completely in this performance. This placid, meditative and contemplative mood was beautifully preserved by the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées, and choir under Philippe Herreweghe. The Pie Jesu was eloquently and movingly sung by Dorothee Mields. Perhaps there could have been a touch more drama in the expressiveness .... Of the many versions he wrote, I am unsure which one was performed on this occasion.\n\nJohannes Brahms\n\nBegräbnisgesang for mixed choir and wind instruments, Op. 13\n\nI was unfamiliar with this early masterpiece of Brahms that is both tragic and mysteriously optimistic. A most unusual composition of 1858, two years after the death of Robert Schumann. One can assume fond memories of Schumann inspired this small Requiem. He uses wind instruments to delineate the character of the work. Brahms orchestrates with the mahogany colours of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trombones, and tuba not forgetting timpani. There is an absence of strings sections. The ancient, quasi-liturgical text gives the work an archaic character. One is reminded of Renaissance Gabrieli brass consorts in Venice and Bach cantatas. This short piece was remarkably effective during this concert.\n\nIgor Stravinsky\n\nSymphony of Psalms\n\nIn the summer of 1929, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky commissioned a symphony from Igor Stravinsky to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of Boston Symphony Orchestra. However, the composer by this time in his life had returned to religiosity and the Russian Orthodox faith of his childhood and youth, arguably the most authentically Russian of all cultural values.\n\nThe symphony for Koussevitzky would be transmuted into the Symphony of Psalms, a choral work based on the Latin bible. He chose the Catholic Latin text, as instrumental accompaniment was not permitted in liturgical Orthodox music. It was completed during August 1930 in Nice.\n\nStravinsky orchestrates the Symphony of Psalms an unusual concentration of flutes, trumpets, and pianos, omitting clarinets and high strings such as violins, violas as. Stravinsky chose verses from psalms 38, 39 and 150. The double fugal writing of the second movement is monumental with architectural symbolism. The chorus intones that God 'heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery.' and the chorus sings 'And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.'\n\nNothing resembling The Rite of Spring, this symphony reveals his novel neoclassical style of clarity and restraint.\n\nThe Finale is a setting of text of Psalm 150. Stravinsky wrote: “the allegro in the 150th Psalm was inspired by a vision of Elijah’s chariot climbing the heavens [11 Kings 2, 11]; I do not think I had ever written anything so literal as the triplets for horns and piano to suggest the horses and the chariot. The final hymn of praise must be thought of as issuing from the skies; agitation is followed by the calm of praise.” A feeling of rather 'heavenly tranquillity' concluded the work.\n\nThis fine performance was a fitting conclusion to the 50th anniversary of the death of Igor Stravinsky in New York on April 6th 1971. His funeral was held in Venice a little over a week later. He is buried on Isola de San Michele.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nMonday 30.08.21 20:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Chamber Music Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nChloe Jiyeong Mun piano\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nMazurka in B major Op. 56 No. 1\n\nMazurka in C major Op. 56 No. 2\n\nMazurka in C minor Op. 56 No. 3\n\nOverall Mun played these mazurkas with great sensitiveness and expressively.\n\nNo. 1 in B major\n\nEngaging nostalgia was expressed here by Mun within its harmonically adventurous and fragmented nature. The mazurka rhythm emerges clearly.\n\nNo. 2 in C major\n\nFerdynand Hoesick described this mazurka that has such a rustic dance feel as follows: ‘The basses bellow, the strings go hell for leather, the lads dance with the lasses and they all but wreck the inn’. I felt Mun was quite boisterous and rumbustious to satisfy the character of the work.\n\nNo. 3 in C minor\n\nI always felt this mazurka as not based in reality but in nostalgic dream and memories. I felt Mun brought great fragility to this refined work which drifts over the Mazovian plain on a summer breeze, fading away to nothing as the first autumn leaves fall into a stream...\n\n24 Preludes, Op. 28\n\nI felt this to be a spectacular and formidable account of this popular cycle. However, for me was too overtly 'pianistic' in a virtuoso sense and rather predictably straightforward with what one might term, 'closely studied and learned expressive gestures', rather than spontaneous, organic expressions of emotional turmoil. There could have been far more contrast displayed in the distinct character of each prelude.The utter despair of No: 2 in A minor is a clear example. There was no hint of the haunted nature of some preludes, haunted by the ghosts of Valldemossa and the demons that inhabit our lives. I felt, however brilliant her execution (and it certainly was that), the approach lacked true personal individuality, audience communicative electricity and a characteristic 'voice' in its sheer perfectionism, unless one regards this quality as an individual characteristic in itself. The metaphysical underside of these works, the dark realities were buried far beneath the surface brilliance.\n\nThe slightly imperfect execution of a task in life has a curiously attractive human quality, especially in musical performance. I feel famous labels in the the recording industry, for quite understandable commercial reasons, insists on the 'perfect' account of any recorded work with no blemishes (pace Grigory Sokolov who only agrees to release carefully selected recordings of his live concerts). Oddly, a great pioneer of this perfectionist ideology was the great Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. I tend to feel it is an unfortunate physical and cosmetic trait of our times in many areas of life. Mun gave a phenomenally virtuosic, not sufficiently expressive and on occasion, excessively emotional, account of the cycle, at least for my taste. Is not Chopin a master of understatement and suggestion in the Preludes?\n\nIt would of course have been impossible for Chopin to have ever considered performing this complete radical cycle in his own musical and cultural environment (not least because of the brevity of many of the pieces). It is unlikely ever to have even occurred to him to do this, the way programmes were designed piecemeal at the time. I tend to feel the performance of them as a cycle is of course possible but not entirely justified. In some of his programmes and others of the period, a few preludes are scattered randomly through them like diamond dust. Each piece contains within it entire worlds and destinies of the human spirit and deserves individual attention rather than being a brick in a monumental edifice.\n\nIt is now well established by structuralists and Bach scholars as a complete and symmetrical work, a masterpiece of integrated yet unrelated ‘fragments’ (in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century sense of that aesthetic term). Each prelude can of course stand on its own as a perfect miniature landscape of emotional feeling and tonal climate. But ‘Why Preludes? Preludes to what?’ André Gide asked rather gratuitously. One possible explanation is that the idea of 'preluding' as an improvisational activity in the same key for a short time before a large keyboard work was to be performed was well established in Chopin's day but has been abandoned in modern times.\n\nThe Preludes surely extend the prescient Chopin remark 'I indicate, it's up to the listener to complete the picture'.\n\nClaude Debussy (1862-1918)\n\nImages I\n\nImages II\n\nDebussy wrote in a letter to Edgar Varèse: ‘I love pictures almost as much as music.’ The connections between creative arts has always preoccupied me. Robert Schumann in the mid-19th century wrote: ‘The painter can learn from a symphony by Beethoven, just as the musician can learn from a work by Goethe.’ Debussy painted pictures with tones and became associated with Impressionism in the manner of the French painter Monet.\n\nPebble thrown into Loch Katrine, Scotland\n\nMystery lies in the quiet opening of the Reflets dans l’eau. The pianist Marguerite Long, a contemporary of Debussy, said that the composer referred to the opening motif as ‘a little circle in water with a little pebble falling into it’.\n\nDebussy greatly admired French culture of the 18th century, so the choice of inspiration being Jean Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) is not unexpected. I would however have thought the clavecin pieces of François Couperin and paintings by Watteau closer to Debussy’s temperament but obviously he considered not. Another misconception of mine perhaps. The Hommage à Rameau is ‘in the style of a Sarabande’ a slow, stately 18th-century dance with a deeply affecting melody. I found her account expressively attractive but the different colours and voices can be brought forward with more subtlety and judicious use of the pedal.\n\nMouvement is pure piano virtuosity of breathtaking difficulty by Debussy, as if it was an endless etude. Mun with her extraordinary finger dexterity, performed this impressively. However, greater lightness would have created the agitated impressionistic effect of leaves in the wind that develops into the gusts of a storm, with prominent internal voices, as Debussy surely intended.\n\nIn one's soul, one needs that curious, almost pantheistic feeling for nature and Impressionism that is so embedded in the music of Debussy. The reason I love Polish trees is their leaves vibrate in the breeze like a Monet painting. The Poissons d'or from Images II was exceptionally impressionistic and ravishing. In performing Debussy on the piano, one should aspire to be a seductive performer ….. these works are not virtuosic showpieces.\n\nAgain, these compositions, which are in reality glorious paintings in sound, should give the listener a feeling of searching improvisation and a diffuse impressionistic quality of pianistic colour, in much the same way as an 'image' magically coalesces under the brushstrokes of an artist on a canvas placed on an easel. Mun achieved this creative ambiance only in part. Her indispensable technical brilliance tended to overshadow the creation of the wonderfully, luminous atmosphere Debussy intends for us. One needs to rise some way above keyboard facility, exploring the intangible realm of lyric poetry. A more creative use of the pedal would have created this diaphanous filter through which we hear and see in the mind's eye some of these alluring 'Images'.\n\nAleksander Skriabin\n\nPiano Sonata No. 4 in F-sharp major, Op. 30\n\nThis young Korean pianist now tried valiantly to take us into the realms of magic, the mystical and the metaphysical. For this work Scriabin wrote a programme: a poem describing flight to a distant star, which partly reads:\n\nThinly veiled in transparent cloud\n\nA star shines softly, far and lonely.\n\nHow beautiful! The azure secret\n\nOf its radiance beckons, lulls me …\n\nVehement desire, sensual, insane, sweet …\n\nNow! Joyfully I fly upward toward you,\n\nFreely I take wing.\n\nMad dance, godlike play …\n\nI draw near in my longing …\n\nDrink you in, sea of light, you light of my own self …\n\nThe poem works with the music in symbiosis. The notion of flight is ever present in his extraordinary mind - Prestissimo volando is the indication. In the first movement the 'Tristan' yearning of love and desire follows without a break to a movement of which Scriabin demanded ‘I want it even faster, as fast as possible, on the verge of the possible … it must be a flight at the speed of light, straight towards the sun, into the sun!’\n\nThe sonata ends in triumphal joy. Scriabin once wrote: ‘To become an optimist in the true sense of the word, one must have been prey to despair and surmounted it.’ The pianism here was formidable but one must also possess a deep neurosis to penetrate Scriabin and his uncommon psyche. The expression of Vehement desire, sensual, insane, sweet … requires the possession of an almost decadent and certainly singular imagination. Despite her brilliant fingers, I never felt Mun passed with us into one metaphysical dimension deeper, a creation which the visionary poetry surely demands.\n\nAn exceptionally promising recital by this young artist. More attention to the context in which any great work is conceived may allow a more emotional and expressive spiritual depth to emerge from this astonishing keyboard mastery.\n\nAs an encore, a sensitive and subtly moving Claire de Lune .... the 'perfect' choice.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSunday 29.08.21 18:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nNelson Goerner period piano\n\nPhilippe Herreweghe conductor\n\nThe Orchestre des Champs-Élysées\n\nPerhaps living in Warsaw and examining the youth of Chopin in detail, walking in his footsteps, has made me particularly aware of the genesis and gestation of his two youthful piano concertos.\n\nThe renowned Orchestre des Champs-Élysées period instrument orchestra assembled exceptionally large forces this evening for the Classical rather than Romantic orchestra of Chopin's period (five double basses!). I felt the resultant dynamic inflation rather overwhelmed the superb National Chopin Institute 1849 Erard piano in the fine rendition by Nelson Goerner, a master pianist of these concerti. The concertos were originally conceived in a chamber style and for far smaller forces than these that would allow the reduced instrumental counterpoint, polyphony, rubato and phrasing to expressively shine in balanced symbiosis with the period piano.\n\nPortrait of the young Chopin by Ambroży Mieroszewski (1829)\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nPiano Concerto in E minor Op. 11\n\nA few words about the E Minor Piano Concerto Op.11 and how I conceive of it. The review will then perhaps make a little more sense seen through the inescapable filter of my own life experience, that of just one listener.\n\nAs is well known, although designated No.1, it is actually his second concerto. The first written was in F-minor Op.21. The issue is not of the greatest chronological significance because Chopin’s two piano concertos were composed within a year of each other although different in essential character. Chopin always chose the E minor to impress at his rare concerts. I am always amazed at the nature of true genius displayed when Chopin was in his late teens. At its premiere in 1830, he played the piano part himself, and the concert marked his final public appearance as a pianist in Poland. Soon Chopin was to leave for Vienna and then Paris, where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nThe opening Allegro movement has the character maestoso which we find in the noble and proud polonaises, a measured grandiosity that should be dispatched with èlan and poetry. The styl brillant of the period should be clear to hear in its animation and what in Chopin's day was termed 'enthusiasm'. I felt the Allegro maestoso did not move forward with the irresistible, passionate impulse I think it requires, musical phrases slightly broken and not leading inexorably into one another like a mountain stream in the styl brillant.\n\nThe style owes so much to the sparkling momentum of the concertos of Hummel. Graceful rhapsodic sweeps remind me of eagles taking updrafts in the High Tatras. There are calm moments of reflection and fiorituras as delicate as Koniakowska lace. Nelson Goerner accomplished this in fine style, even if the orchestra was rather weighty and the Bach inspired polyphony unclear.\n\nAttempts to transform musical experience into the very different language of my words is fraught with difficulties. Forgive the hyperbole not so popular in 2021!\n\nThe Romanza-Larghetto has always taken me on an imaginative poetic flight as it did Chopin himself when he wrote about it to his close friend. In this Larghetto (there is another in the F-minor concerto)– its character is clarified in the score, following Mozart in choosing a Romance (the sole occasion Chopin used this designation in a piece) – a type of poetic reverie. In a letter to Tytus Woyciechowski, the composer wrote: 'It is not meant to create a powerful effect; it is rather a Romance, calm and melancholy, giving the impression of someone looking gently towards a spot that calls to mind a thousand happy memories. It is a kind of reverie in the moonlight on a beautiful spring evening.'\n\nThe divine melody at this slow tempo is perfectly ardent, one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. Lethargy from dreams begins to awake in a slow movement of unblemished, illusioned rapture.\n\nI conceive of it in daylight. In a sun-dappled grove, lovers lie in long grass by a stream among birches and willows as summer clouds drift towards the horizon. The heart rises with the swallow as leaves fall and drift on a slight breeze. Spider webs glisten in the sun in this slow dance of the heart. A threatening shadow of doubt and a sudden chill soon passes as dusk falls, the last pianissimo note of love thrown towards us by hand.\n\nThis creation of atmosphere was alluring and Goerner was as always subtle, refined and of delicate poetic sensibility. I felt however the orchestra did little to augment these feelings in any particularly idiomatic or creative way, although there were beautiful impressionistic episodes.\n\nThe Rondo follows attacca, without a pause, rousing us from poetic dreams and reveries with robust dance rhythms vivace and rhapsodic gestures. Here we encounter the playfulness, dancing, acting and extreme good humor of Chopin the young man, a neglected aspect of his character in the received paradigm of the later consumptive melancholic.\n\nThe character of the exuberant Polish krakowiak dance is present here, a syncopated, duple-time popular dance in contemporary Kraków. The characteristic rhythm, liveliness and amusement should be expressed with colour and verve. However, I felt the orchestra had not yet quite grasped what Chopin described as the 'Polish element' of the work in an otherwise reasonable performance. The movement seemed to me to embrace the krakowiak rhythms quite well and robustly but for me it failed to achieve energetic 'lift off' in what I might call le styl exuberant (to invent a French phrase).The theme of the episode – led in octave unison against the pizzicato of the strings – is all born of this virtuosic style brillant.\n\nThe entire musical population of Warsaw was drawn to the National Theatre for the premiere. One young singer was Konstancja Gładkowska. ‘Dressed becomingly in white, with roses in her hair' as Chopin romantically described her. She sang the cavatina from Rossini’s La donna del lago.\n\nPiano Concerto in F minor Op. 21\n\nThe Chopin F minor concerto follows the Mozart model and was directly influenced by the style brillant of Hummel, Kalkbrenner, Moscheles or Ries. Goerner expressed this internally iridescent style outstandingly well. Here in this early work Chopin magically transforms the Classical into the Romantic style.\n\n‘As I already have, perhaps unfortunately, my ideal, whom I faithfully serve, without having spoken to her for half a year already, of whom I dream, in remembrance of whom was created the adagio of my concerto’ (Chopin to his friend Tytus Woyciechowski, 3 October 1829).\n\nThe work itself was written 1829-30. As we all know by now, this concerto was inspired by Chopin’s infatuation, or was it youthful love, for the soprano Konstancja Gładkowska. Strangely, it was published a few years later with a dedication to Delfina Potocka. I felt again that the orchestra had not yet grasped nor well delineated the Polish rhetorical gestures concealed within the work.\n\nHowever, the Larghetto love song was moving and full of considered poetry and lyricism. The movement contains, together with the E minor concerto Romanza, arguably the most beautiful love song ever written for piano and orchestra. This unrequited love of Chopin for Konstancja Gładkowska that he 'enjoyed' at an inaccessible psychological and physical distance, produced yearning lyrical melodies of an intense order. As can be the way in life, it is said she preferred the attentions of the handsome, uniformed Russian officers to our poetic genius.\n\nThe testing Allegro vivace seemed to provide technical challenges for everyone, especially in orchestral and soloist co-ordination.\n\nIt thrills us with the exuberance of a dance of kujawiak provenance. It plays with two kinds of dance gesture. The first, defined by the composer as semplice ma graziosamente, characterizes the principal theme of the Rondo, namely the refrain. A different kind of dance character – swashbuckling and truculent – is presented by the episodes, which are scored in a particularly interesting way. The first episode is bursting with energy. The second, played scherzando and rubato, brings a rustic aura. It is a cliché of merry-making in a country inn, or perhaps in front of a manor house, at a harvest festival, when the young Chopin danced till he dropped with the whole of the village. The striking of the strings with the stick of the bow, the pizzicato and the open fifths of the basses appear to show that Chopin preserved the atmosphere of those days in his memory. (the distinguished Polish musicologist Mieczysław Tomaszewski)\n\nThe repetitions of styl brillant phrases of the kujawiak province (of which there are many) were not yet properly understood by the orchestra, although Goerner surely by now has it flowing in his bloodstream. The phrases were played in almost exactly the same way in terms of dynamics and articulation when they beg for creative and imaginative contrasts, or at the very least, shadows of the slightly distorted reflections in a mirror. A fine performance but not quite as commanding as I had anticipated from this exceptional period orchestra.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSaturday 28.08.21 20:00\n\nRoyal Castle Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nAlexandre Tharaud piano\n\nI unfortunately did not share a musical affinity with this esteemed musician and pianist, so would prefer not to comment my personal impressions of the performance.

However, as we all realize, a live performance is always superior to a recording (the electromagnetic emanations of a live musician affect the audience) and so it was tonight.\n\nThis recital was a unique and ultra-rare aesthetic treat - the opportunity to hear this guitar recital in the magnificent, yet intimate ambiance of the Ballroom of the Royal Castle in Warsaw.\n\nMarek Konrad Sokołowski\n\nDiligènza postale\n\nMarek Konrad Sokołowski (1818-1883) possessed the moniker 'Byron of the guitar' and was lauded to the skies in Europe but particularly in Russia. Born in 1818 near Berdyczów in present day Ukraine, he was largely self-taught from childhood. During the 1860s he made distinguished tours of Paris, London, Vienna, Milan, Berlin, Hamburg, Brussels, Vilnius, Leipzig, Poznań, Krakow, Warsaw, Lviv before highly distinguished aristocratic audiences. As a man, although earning high fees, he was outstandingly generous towards his impoverished family, especially his ill mother. An artist of the highest refinement he was deeply affected by the January Uprising (22 January 1863 – 18 June 1864) which resulted in Poles and Lithuanians being persecuted, undergoing arrest, suffering execution and or deported to Siberia.\n\nThis sadness of internal reflection bordering on despair, expressively and emotionally overlays his Etude in D major. A poignant piece ...\n\nA Mail Coach around 1850\n\nFeliks Horecki\n\nFantasy in D major Op. 40\n\nFelix Horecki (1796-1870) was a sparkling pupil of the great Italian guitarist Mauro Giulani (1781-1829) who had conquered Europe with his art. Horecki tragically injured his hand which resulted in his teaching the guitar in Edinburgh and composing pedagogical miniatures. In the Fantasy in D major Op.40 we have a perfect example of the entertaining and undemanding style brillant embraced by Chopin but performed on the guitar with great style and delicacy by Kowalski.\n\nJan Nepomucen Bobrowicz (1805-1881) was known as 'the Chopin of the guitar'. He was also one of the most renowned Polish performer-composers of the day and his original compositions on this recording support this contention. Also a publisher of literary works in Polish, he significantly aided the preservation of the language during the brutal Partitions of the country by smuggling hundreds of works across the frontier.\n\nHe produced some ravishing, idiomatic transcriptions of Chopin Mazurkas for the guitar. The Op.6 and Op.7 Chopin mazurkas, transcribed so musically for the guitar, although familiar, opened a window onto a different landscape of musical interpretation and content for me. The loving, slow tempo and gentleness of the finger-plucked sonority, the caressed melodies, transported me into an atmosphere of intimacy, colour and refinement rarely encountered on the percussive piano in a modern concert hall, except perhaps by pianists of great stature. Of course the folk element, and perhaps surprisingly a Sarmatian feel of the plucked Oud, were heightened on this modest instrument so popular with ordinary folk and Chopin himself. Sarmatian traits were cultivated in the Polish character in the eighteenth century.\n\nOn 2nd November 1830, Chopin left Poland for Vienna, never to return. He travelled in the coach with his teacher Józef Elsner and some friends as far as the Wola gate, not so distant from the old election field for Polish kings. In a typically protracted Polish farewell they alighted shortly after leaving the city, the coach was suddenly surrounded by a group of men. His old teacher had written a cantata which the assembled choir sang accompanied by a guitar, the instrument he particularly loved. The words implored Chopin to remember Poland and to hold the harmonies of the country close in his soul wherever he might be. When listening to these transcriptions for the expressive guitar, one cannot help but reflect on this poetic, melancholic image of tearful departure, the sorrows of exile and the inherent intense nostalgia of both sadness and remembered joys.\n\nThe mazurkas were not performed in this order as an integrated group but scattered throughout for variety like precious gems from a profligate Polish Countess.\n\nStanisław Szczepanowski\n\nIntroduction et variations brillantes sur un air national\n\nUne Larme. Morceau expresif\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis was supplanted after 1808 for men by the familiar Spanish guitar, although women tended to favour the more delicate English version so Łukasz Gołębiowski tells us in Games and Amusements of Various Classes (1831)\n\nI managed to find a rare recording of the English Guitar with 18th century guitar music written expressly for it by Handel and Geminiani including a charming piece by J.C.Bach for English Guitar and Violin accompaniment. Taro Takeuchi plays with a seductive tenderness. The instrument should be used far more often in recital !\n\n'The quiet tones, lower tuning and lush chords of the Spanish guitar accompany singing and satisfactorily support the human voice: the English guitar plays more substantial pieces.'\n\nThe finest craftsman was Henryk Rudert I. His instruments with gut strings were carved and inlaid with wood, silver and ivory. They were acclaimed for their rich tone.\n\nI had no idea how highly Polish guitarists and their compositions were regarded in nineteenth century Europe - this is sure to be a surprise for many.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxDwOIJp5p4\n\nFriday 27.08.21 21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nDolcissima mia vita - Choral music concert\n\nPhilippe Herreweghe conductor\n\nThomas Boysen lute\n\nVocale Ghent\n\nPietro Antonio Melli\n\n„Il Carlino”. Capriccio Cromatico\n\nCarlo Gesualdo da Venosa\n\nMadrigali a 5 voci, libro Quinto\n\nDon Carlo Gesualdo (1566-1613)\n\nDonna Maria d'Avalos (1562-1590)\n\nArt Nouveau Illustration by Léon Lebègue (1863-1944) from the \"Histoire de dona Maria d'Avalos et duc d'Andria\" by Anatole France (1902)\n\nThe life and work of the composer Carlo Gesualdo (1566-1613) has fascinated me all my musical life.\n\n'How much ruin lust has brought to the world is evident for the pages of writers filled with it, and there is no doubt whatsoever that it brings along with it all sorts of evils and discords, and weakness the body and does harm to all the virtues and goodness of the soul.' This is the opening sentence of the colourful tale of intrigue and murder of the year 1590 that transpired in Naples and detailed among the chroniques scandaleuses of the Corona MS. The story may be well known, but the language continues to entertain in our more secular and possibly tolerant age. 'Seeing her approach, he came without wasting time, and taking her in his arms, kissed her a thousand times - as she did him - and with the greatest ardour they were moved to enjoy together the ultimate amorous delight.'\n\nSuch were the first intimacies of the handsome cavaliere, Don Fabrizio Carafa, Duke of Andria, and Donna Maria d'Avalos, the intensely beautiful wife of the later immortal madrigal composer, Don Carlo Gesualdo. The affair was inevitably discovered, and Gesualdo planned his revenge with the complicity of his acolytes.\n\nThe subsequent investigation by the Grand Court of the Vicaria revealed among many tawdry details: '...at around six hours of the night...' Don Carlo asked his valet for some water and unexpectedly dressed. When his valet asked him where he was going at such an hour he replied 'hunting'. Further surprise evidenced by the hour elicited the remark: 'You will see the kind of hunting I am going to do!' Don Carlo gathered a sword, a dirk, a dagger and a small arquebus (a long gun similar to a rifle). He told his valet 'I am going to slay the Duke of Andria and that whore, Donna Maria.'\n\nTogether with three accomplices (servants) armed with halberds, he made towards Donna Maria's room. He smashed down the already weakened door shouting 'Kill that scoundrel along with this harlot! Shall a Gesualdo be made a cuckold?' The lovers were murdered in flagrante with firearm and sword and their bodies mutilated with deep wounds, puncturing even the wooden floor. Oddly, the Duke was reported to be wearing the Lady's night shirt. Don Carlo emerged from the bedchamber, 'his hands covered in blood', Even then he re-entered the room to inflict several more dagger thrusts, all the while muttering 'I do not believe she is dead.' Laconically, the record comments 'Little was seen of Gesualdo for a considerable period.'\n\nGesualdo was condemned by some for the crime but there was also a great deal of sympathy for the handsome lovers. Many poems by Tasso express a conflict of loyalties - the poet loved all the parties involved and was given immense emotional conflict by these understandable events, understandable given the Italian temperament of the time. According to the prevailing codes of aristocratic honour of the day, Don Carlo had little choice but to take some violent revenge.\n\nAs might be imagined, knowledge of these tragic and passionate events overlay any appreciation of his madrigals. It is next to impossible to consider the music entirely objectively out of this dramatic and violent context unless one is a musicologist. They deal with him exhaustively and extensively. As a listener, the task is near impossible, certainly considering the harmonically revolutionary and deeply expressive madrigals of Book V which we heard this evening.\n\nThe Period between the High Renaissance and the Baroque (1520-1620) can be considered the Age of Mannerism. The music of these last two books of madrigals by Gesualdo (Books V and VI) were considered, until modern times, as the effusions of severe neurosis but in hindsight, are among the greatest of avant garde musical compositions.\n\nThe performance tonight moved us into the enchanted realms of the highest in art and exerted an incontestable atmosphere of magic. One can of course analyse musicologically what the composer contrives with language, his novel and revolutionary word-splitting, the harmonic adventurism. Gesualdo, the writer of the texts, makes concentrated use of words such as 'joy', 'death and to die', 'to love', 'to sigh', 'to breathe', 'to weep' and other symbolic eroticism. He makes unmistakable reference, in one's possibly fervid imagination, to regrets of the tragic events of his marriage to the sensual and apparently libidinous Donna Maria.\n\nOne can trace the profound influence of the madrigalist Luzzasco Luzzaschi (1545-1607) in his compositions. However, this does not explain his 'alchemical' (my word) use of dissonance, counterpoint, bizarre melodic intervals, suspensions, chromaticism, enharmonic changes - all of which result in breathtaking emotional expressiveness.\n\nThe Vocale Ghent under Philippe Herreweghe transported us into another world of Mannerist force and power with their superb clarity of intonation and sureness of enunciating sublime micro-pitches. The enharmonic progressions were quite otherworldly. Emotional relief during 'rests' from this intensity, provided by the lutenist Thomas Boysen, were remarkable, welcome and profoundly affecting as a catalyst of time travel.\n\nIt was sensitive, musical and perceptive to mount this concert during the 50th anniversary of the death of Igor Stravinsky. The Russian was one of Gesualdo's greatest admirers in the 20th century. In 1960 he dedicated the Monumentum pro Gesualdo to him, an instrumental arrangement of three of Gesualdo’s madrigals. He wrote a highly amusing Preface to the brilliant book I am indebted to: Gesualdo The man and his music by Glenn Watkins (Oxford 1973). Stravinsky overturns the many misunderstandings of Gesualdo's music, referring to his mode of expression as dramatic and highly intimate with much dynamic shading. He visited the dilapidated castle at Gesualdo and with his poor Italian managed to alarm the tenants by apparently admitting publicly that he was the murderer of his first wife!\n\nA quite extraordinary concert of the highest art and for me the uncontested highlight of the entire festival.\n\nAlessandro Piccinini (1566-1638)\n\nRicercare Primo\n\nToccata Cromatica III & VI\n\nPassacaglia\n\nGirl with a Lute - Michelangelo Caravaggio\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKng6zhtgL0\n\nWednesday 25.08.21 21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nYulianna Avdeeva piano\n\nI always anticipate recitals by Yulianna Avdeeva since I first heard her perform at the 2010 XVI International Chopin Competition in Warsaw when I predicted she would win from her first stage. I wrote at the time:\n\nYulianna Avdeeva has a formidable and regal stage presence, magnificent technique and mature musicality as well as a great spirit - a true 'soul' in the old Russian sense. [...] She plays in a truly aristocratic manner with superbly expressive, blue-blooded tone of great self-confidence and pride. Her rubato is affecting and just the sheer number of subtle pianistic 'things' she does at the keyboard is so imaginative - a complete piano technique - all degrees of staccato up to staccatissimo, a wide dynamic range, cantabile, a detached presto or a caressing legato, the correct durations of notes carefully observed - she can do anything with those marvellous fingers. Avdeeva is also tremendously intense emotionally and utterly convincing.\n\nI have no reason to change my mind eleven years later except to observe that she has developed exponentially as a musician and pianist since those far off days.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nPolonaise-Fantasy in A flat major Op. 61\n\nIt is an ambitious choice even for a pianist of the stature Yulianna Avdeeva to open a recital with the immensely demanding Polonaise-Fantasie of Chopin. The work contains all the troubled emotion and desire for strength in the face of the multiple adversities that beset the composer at this late stage in his life.\n\nAvdeeva has developed greatly as an artist in recent years and was able to authoritatively grasp what various musicologists for better or worse have termed Chopin’s ‘Last Style’. The composers mental and physical state were fractured at the time of composition and this is ever present in this complex, highly demanding work – his last extended composition for the piano. He struggled with the formal design in a final attempt at musical renewal and forging a new aesthetic. Avdeeva sheer virtuosity and intimate understanding of the emotional landscape of the work mad for a fine performance.\n\nWładysław Szpilman\n\nSuite ‘The Life of the Machines’\n\nWładysław Szpilman\n\nThis highly enjoyable three movement suite by Władysław Szpilman, of all composers, a work entirely unknown to me, gives machines rather an attractive and affecting life of their own! Listening was rather like watching robots at work in a car assembly plant - fascinating, implacable but inexplicably carrying associative human emotions. Rather like automata that often reduced nineteenth century observers to tears. Not in this case! An explosion of virtuosic dance and amusement by Avdeeva. Imagine learning the work from memory!\n\nMieczysław Weinberg\n\nPiano Sonata No. 4, Op. 56\n\nThis venerated Polish composer lived in exile for some 57 years of his life. Mieczysław Weinberg (1919-1996) is a major composer of symphonies, chamber music, piano sonatas, operas and vocal works. His monumental Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies were appreciated and elevated internationally by the conductor Kirill Kondrashin, in addition to the support of Dimitry Shostakovich as well as the Borodin Quartet, Emil Gilels, Mstislav Rostropovich and Leonid Kogan.\n\nHis fertile and significant output is being progressively adopted by star performers such as Avdeeva. In this sonata she brilliantly revealed his individualism, fierce ethical anger, drama and intimacy His rediscovery is one of the great treasures of our musical times and Avdeeva is a penetrating and idiomatic interpreter and pioneer of this resuscitation of his sensibility.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nPartita No. 2 in C minor (BWV 826)\n\nA fine performance entirely without pedal which gave it arresting articulation and mavellous finger legato. Not a deeply individualistic and expressive performance (as say the recent Bach of Piotr Anderszewski) but far be it from me to criticize Avdeeva at this summit level of musicianship and pianism.\n\nSergei Rachmaninow\n\nPiano Sonata No. 2 in B flat minor Op. 36\n\nThe recital closed with one of my favourite piano sonatas, the Sonata No.2 in B-flat minor Op. 36 by Rachmaninoff (original 1913 - revised 1931). I know this is a desperately unfair comparison but in May 1982 I queued for 8 hours in London in the freezing rain to buy a fabulously expensive ticket for Horowitz's last recital in the capital. The Prince of Wales had invited him to play at the Royal Festival Hall and among a number of works was this Rachmaninoff sonata. What a recital that was! A standing ovation before he even played a note.\n\nI cannot listen to anyone playing this sonata without that experience haunting my musical memory, even though the great Ukrainian born in Kiev was past is best (b.1903 d.1989). His London 1968 recorded version is superior to my mind. Horowitz considered his meeting with Rachmaninoff the greatest musical experience and success of his life and adored the nineteenth century 'Russianess' of his music. He created a syncretic version of the original and reduced versions of this sonata with Rachmaninoff's permission but not being a musicologist I am unsure which version Avdeeva performed this evening.\n\nI felt Avdeeva plumbed the spiritual depths of this (dare I say this today in the absurd world of PC censorship) profoundly Slavic, quintessentially Russian soul - the suffering, conflicting emotions, contraditions, intimate introspection, anger, despair, the Russian steppe in panoramic vision, the bells of the Russian Orthodox Church (Rachmaninoff's The Bells was conceived at the same time as this sonata), the Great Gate of Kiev and the passionate personal references the massive work entails. Rachmaninoff himself said in an interview that music should be the 'expression of a composer's complex personality, [..] the country of his birth, his love affairs, his religion, the books which have influenced him, the pictures he loves...'\n\nAh, and those fervent tunes of his that speak so to the heart...I am not ashamed to love them. With many echoes of Horowitz, Aveedva transported me unresistant along this monumental spiritual and sensual path of musical rapture. A standing ovation for this performance.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_8LnIGMByE\n\nTuesday 24.08.21 21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nEarly Music Concert\n\nVáclav Luks conductor\n\nCollegium Vocale 1704\n\nCollegium 1704\n\nMarcin Mielczewski\n\nTriumphalis recurrit dies beati Martini\n\nMissa Triumphalis\n\nJan Dismas Zelenka\n\nMissa (1724)\n\nJan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745)\n\nBartłomiej Pękiel\n\nMissa a 14\n\nThis was a particularly uplifting concert in a spiritual sense especially if the echoes of one's past religiosity (as in my case) or present firm beliefs enable renewed confirmation of Christian faith - a need increasingly obvious with passing time and current events mirroring the past.\n\nThe conductor Václav Luks arranged the chronology of the parts of the Tridentine Masses above according to his own plan rather than the given forms. This gave me some confusion but did not detract one iota from the immanent beauty of the performance. As always the work by that great Czech genius Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) carried me to the heights ....\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1coTRmhqPro\n\nTuesday 24.08.21 17:00\n\nRoyal Castle Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nAngela Hewitt piano\n\nThe Ballroom of the Royal Castle is a superb musical venue and an aesthetically overwhelming room. Domenico Merlini, the distinguished eighteenth century Italian architect from Brescia who brought Palladianism to Poland, designed it with the allegorical guidance of king Stanisław Augustus. New gold leaf glisters from every crevice in a blaze of mirrored chandeliers.The Steinway in this cavernous, opulent Ballroom, is always far louder than one might anticipate.\n\nThe online sound balance is far superior.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nPrelude and Fugue in A minor (BWV 894)\n\nWith the renowned reputation Angela Hewitt has achieved for her performances of Bach on the piano, in concert and recordings, it would simply be mean-spirited, perhaps even clichéd of me, to indicate how I prefer Bach on the harpsichord. Her illustrious international career and many prestigious awards speaks for itself. Of course this composer of the greatest genius can be satisfyingly interpreted in almost any medium. However, the resonant acoustic of this remarkable room did rather inflate the dynamic and coarsen the texture of this fine performance.\n\nBach was renowned, especially at the magnificent courts at Dresden and Berlin, for his talent at improvisation at the harpsichord. This work, although written down and , gives us an image of this ability. We continually hear as Johann Nikolaus Forkel described Bach’s early works in 1802 as 'walking or jumping up and down on the instrument'. In this magnificent Ballroom, one could imagine as this 'concerto' unfolded, a glittering, entertaining assembly of princes, courtiers and dignitaries, in addition to their fashionable wives and possibly mistresses. Bach was always keen to impress at court and reap any possible financial or rewards in social status Although perhaps not conceived at the standard of his more considered works, BWV 894 is a magnificent virtuoso composition to which Hewitt gave full reign.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nSonata in D major (K. 284)\n\nHewitt chose another remarkable and unique work for her next item, this a sonata by Mozart astonishing among his clavier sonatas. He composed this work in March 1777 in Munich for Baron Thaddäus von Dürnitz. Clearly the Count wanted something special, a 'French style' brilliant composition. He received what Albert Einstein referred to as 'a miracle'.\n\nI am sure performing at the Royal Castle in Warsaw prompted the choice of this sonata by Hewitt being governed by the Polonaise en Rondeau contained within it and for the first time a tema con variazione. Einstein continues concerning the second version of the first movement as 'having a sensuous richness and a concert-like animation, which is a perpetual source of wonder'. These variations show Mozart's remarkable range of fertile, creative imagination.\n\nI have the same reservations concerning a Steinway in the acoustic of this sumptuous Ballroom tending to exaggerate dynamic, tone and touch of an otherwise impressive, virtuosic and idiomatic performance by Angela Hewitt.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nNocturne in F minor Op. 55 No. 1\n\nNocturne in E flat major Op. 55 No. 2\n\nScherzo in E major Op. 54\n\nIn many ways I perfectly understand the nostalgic temptation by Angela Hewitt to play Chopin in Warsaw once again, to rediscover her brilliant pianistic youth (ah, how I too feel this consuming need) , especially in this year of the International Chopin Competition. She took part in the scandal-plagued, 'Pogorelich', 10th International Fryderyk Chopin Competition in 1980, but was defeated in the third round (a phenomenal achievement in itself) by the extraordinary talents of that year. All prize winners went on to illustrious international careers. Ewa Pobocka has also even taken up the keyboard works of Bach in a profound and interpretatively deep manner.\n\nHewitt's remarkable but almost entirely forgotten performances during that competition is however available as a National Chopin Institute recording which I heartily recommend. The F-sharp minor Polonaise alone possesses the greatest imaginable nobility, żal, moving cantilena and glorious tone. The same could be said of the prodigious Fantasy in F minor Op.49, so vehement and nationalistically driven an account. Magnificent.\n\nThese performances, despite small musical solecisms, are a truly passionate revelation by this brilliant teenager that completely overturned, nay eclipsed, many preconceptions I had perhaps unfairly harboured concerning the now emotionally more disciplined, mature artist. She has, in some ways, now profoundly adopted the mantle of Glenn Gould (in reputation as a Bach performer, not similarities in interpretation).\n\nThis recording of Chopin by the young Angela Hewitt is an utter revelation.\n\nhttps://publikacje.nifc.pl/en/wydawnictwa-plytowe/artykul/4320_nifccd-631-angela-hewitt-sonata-in-b-flat-minor-mazurkas-op-50-fantasy-nocturne-etiudes-preludes\n\nand the NIFC shop\n\nhttps://sklep.nifc.pl/index.php?produkt=2_115\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nMonday 23.08.21 21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nSymphonic Concert\n\nNikola Hillebrand soprano\n\nGiulia Semenzato soprano\n\nKrystian Adam tenor\n\nLuigi De Donato bass\n\nVáclav Luks conductor\n\nCollegium 1704\n\nJosef Mysliveček (1737-1781)\n\nSinfonia from the opera Ezio (1777)\n\nOf course being an 'ignorant Westerner' concerning the golden age of Bohemian and Moravian musical life, I am unfamiliar with this composer. I know well the inspiring Czech music by Stamitz of the revolutionary Mannheim school, as well as Zelenka and Benda who all supplied superb music for Dresden, London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nI am becoming, I assure you, (with the Polish Musical Renaissance now in progress and increasingly due to this remarkable festival) far more familiar with rare Polish baroque opera and orchestral music. From the remarkably informative and impressive programme book of the festival, I learn that the Czech Josef Mysliveček wrote an opera seria entitled Ezio with a libretto by no less a person than Metastasio on commission from the Munich electoral court. It was also a milestone in the astonishing European career of the castrato Luigi Marchesi. With this background in my mind I enjoyed the performance very much!\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nBalletmusik z opery Idomeneo (K. 367)\n\nWhat a treat to hear this ballet music, too often omitted in performances of Idomeneo, Re di Creta, one of my favourite Mozart operas. The contrast within Mozart here between the formality of the classical style and his inhabitation of the cusp of the full-blown romantic is fascinating for me. The actual position of this ballet music with its magnificent Chaconne in the actual opera is still unsure. One cannot help but recall the amusing silent ballet scene in Amadeus when a ballet is senselessly performed without the language of music. This was an Excellent idiomatic performance 'danced' by the physically agile conductor Václav Luks.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nDer Schauspieldirektor (K. 486)\n\nIn 1786 by imperial command Mozart was ordered to compose an after-dinner entertainment for Joseph II and visiting dignitaries. At the time he was immersed in composing The Marriage of Figaro.\n\nBeing a formidable wit, Mozart decided on a satirical and highly amusing look at backstage politics and egos. In merely two weeks he conceived the work to be performed before a scintillating crowd at the Schönnbrunn Palace, Vienna on 7 February 1786 and at the Kärntnertor Theater, Vienna, 11 February 1786. Among those present were the Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands, Duke Albert of Sachsen-Techsen; his wife the Archduchess Marie Christine, Joseph II’s sister and the King of Poland’s nephew Prince Stanislas Poniatowski.\n\nFrom the Wiener Zeitung (8 February 1786):\n\nOn Tuesday, His Majesty the Emperor gave a festival at Schönbrunn for Their Excellencies the Governors-General of the Imperial and Royal Netherlands, and a gathering of the local nobility. Forty courtiers as well as Prince Poniatowski being invited, these escorted their own ladies, and at three o’clock set out from the Hofburg in pairs, travelling by both open and closed carriages. His Imperial Majesty accompanied Her Serene Highness the Archduchess Christine. The party alighted at the Orangery, which had been prepared most lavishly and attractively for luncheon for the guests. The table, beneath the orange trees, was most prettily decorated with both local and exotic flowers, blossoms and fruits. While His Majesty, the distinguished visitors and the guests partook of their meal, the Imperial and Royal Chamber Musicians performed on wind instruments. After the banquet, a new play with arias, called Der Schauspieldirektor was performed by actors of the Imperial and Royal National Theatre on a stage especially erected at one end of the Orangery. At its conclusion, an opera buffa, likewise newly composed for this occasion, and entitled Prima la musica e poi le parole, was given by the company of the Court Opera, on the Italian stage erected at the other end of the Orangery. All this time, the Orangery was most gloriously illuminated with numerous lights from candelabra and wall-brackets. After nine o’clock, the entire company returned to town in the same order, each coach being accompanied by two grooms with links.\n\n(The Complete Operas of Mozart Charles Osborne 1978)\n\nFollowing the substantial overture, the scene opens as Frank, an impresario, and Buff, a comic actor, have received permission to open a theatre in Salzburg. Frank is skeptical about starting a company in this 'land of sausage,' but Buff reassures him. 'Leave your good taste at home,' he insists, and think about selling tickets. They must produce vulgar and popular works, not masterpieces; they must promise people fine tortes and pastries but give them dumplings and sauerkraut; hire the cheapest actors and singers but bribe the critics to write glowing reviews. 'The world wants to be deceived,' he says. The high-minded Frank reluctantly consents to go along.\n\nThey begin by hiring dramatic actresses. Madame Pfeil is mediocre and vain, but her wealthy lover offers to contribute her fee. Then they meet her rival, the tragedienne Madame Krone, who performs a dramatic scene together with her colleague Monsieur Herz, and they hire them both. The comic actress, Madame Vogelsang, performs a scene with Buff, and she too is hired, but the tragedienne and the comedienne argue about their fees.\n\nNow that the company has several actors, they look for singers. Mme. Vogelsang and M. Herz recommend their spouses as opera singers. M. Herz presents his wife, who sings a dramatic Ariette: Da schlägt die Abschiedsstunde (There tolls the hour of departure) and Frank hires her. Another soprano appears, a Mlle. Silberklang, who is certain that Frank 'must without a doubt know of my reputation'. She sings 'a small Rondeau' for him Bester Jüngling! (Dearest youth) and she too is hired.\n\nMme. Vogelsang returns to introduce her husband, but by now, the two divas, Mme. Herz and Mlle. Silberklang are bickering about their fees and about who is to receive top billing. In the trio which follows Ich bin die erste Sängerin (I am the prima donna) M. Vogelsang attempts to mediate in vain. Eventually the dramatic actresses too join in the fray, and Frank, in despair, threatens to cancel his plans to form a company. At this, the women relent, and all is peaceful again -- until the next time. In a final ensemble Jeder Künstler strebt nach Ehre (Every artist strives for glory), Mme. Herz, Mlle. Silberklang and M. Vogelsang agree that they must put their art above personality. Nonetheless, the two divas cannot resist competing in a bit of vocal display, and the comedian Buff joins in with an ironic verse of his own. (Synopsis courtesy of Boston Baroque)\n\nThis was a highly entertaining, energetic and amusing performance of a rarely performed work by Mozart that reveals his highly witty imagination. Thank you!\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNPpmyCDOVE\n\nMonday 23.08.21 17:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nKate Liu piano\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nPiano Sonata in A minor (K. 310)\n\nKate Liu brought out the tragic, dramatic character of this dark sonata written in the tragic summer of 1778. Mozart's mother, Anna Maria, was fifty-seven and a uncomplicated woman who had sacrificed a great deal for her musical son. She became chronically ill but medical attention failed to save her despite the ministrations of Wolfgang Amadeus. She died on July 3, 1778. Mozart, at the age of twenty-two, was abandoned in Paris, a city he intensely disliked.\n\nLiu opened the Allegro maestoso in a noble, declamatory style, giving this opening a constrained melodic impetus and great inner strength. Reflective, rather melancholic, even tragic thoughts sensitively brush over the the feeling of disillusionment that suffuses this work. She gave the Andante cantabile con espressione a tender but disturbed personally interned, tender lyricism that was deeply moving. The Presto also contained the atmosphere of personal despair that Mozart expressly reserved for the key of A minor. This is not a conversational and charming piano sonata but a deep emotional expression of loss which Liu instinctively seemed to understand.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nNocturne in G major Op. 37 No. 2 (1839)\n\nThis Nocturne is filled by Chopin with happiness and light, but also as is also the case with this composer, with soulful reflection. Romance is in the ascendant here, a sense of illusioned and illumined dreams. The distinguished American music critic James Huneker (1857-1921) had no hesitation in deeming the second theme to be ‘the most beautiful melody Chopin ever wrote’. Liu gave the nocturne perfect and eloquent expression that was deeply affecting.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nBallade in G minor Op. 23 (1831-1835?)\n\nPenetrating the expressive core of the Chopin Ballades requires an understanding of the influence of a generalized view of the literary, musical and operatic balladic genres of the time. In the structure there are parallels with sonata form but Chopin basically invented an entirely new musical material. I have always felt it helpful to consider the Chopin Ballades as miniature operas being played out in absolute music, forever exercising one's musical imagination.\n\n‘I have received from Chopin a Ballade’, Schumann informed his friend Heinrich Dorn in the autumn of 1836. ‘It seems to me to be the work closest to his genius (though not the most brilliant). I told him that of everything he has created thus far it appeals to my heart the most. After a lengthy silence, Chopin replied with emphasis: “I am glad, because I too like it the best, it is my dearest work”.’\n\nMieczysław Tomaszewski paints the background to this work best:\n\nIt was during the 1830 years that what was original, individual and distinctive in Chopin spoke through his music with great urgency and violence, expressing the composer’s inner world spontaneously and without constraint – a world of real experiences and traumas, sentimental memories and dreams, romantic notions and fancies. Life did not spare him such experiences and traumas in those years, be it in the sphere of patriotic or of intimate feelings. [...]\n\nFor everyone, the ballad was an epic work, in which what had been rejected in Classical high poetry now came to the fore: a world of extraordinary, inexplicable, mysterious, fantastical and irrational events inspired by the popular imagination. In Romantic poetry, the ballad became a ‘programmatic’ genre. It was here that the real met the surreal. Mickiewicz gave his own definition: ‘The ballad is a tale spun from the incidents of everyday (that is, real) life or from chivalrous stories, animated by the strangeness of the Romantic world, sung in a melancholy tone, in a serious style, simple and natural in its expressions’. And there is no doubt that in creating the first of his piano ballades, Chopin allowed himself to be inspired by just such a vision of this highly Romantic genre. What he produced was an epic work telling of something that once occurred, ‘animated by strangeness’, suffused with a ‘melancholy tone’, couched in a serious style, expressed in a natural way, and so closer to an instrumental song than to an elaborate aria.\n\nI felt Liu captured the dramatic narrative more powerfully than most by adopting a rather moderate tempo, broad dramatic phrasing and poetic, highly emotional rubato. She carefully avoided the hysterical virtuosity which often tempts young pianists to become emotionally and meaninglessly carried away during this ballade at the expense of the deeply expressive narrative of the internal psyche and examination of emotional experience.\n\nJohannes Brahms\n\nPiano Sonata No. 3 in F minor, Op. 5\n\nSchumann in the role of music critic (an occupation he considered a literary art and elevated it for a period into such a rarefied region - I agree). He wrote a famous description of the performance in Düsseldorf of Brahms piano sonatas or 'veiled symphonies' composed by the young 20 year old composer in the Leipzig Neue Zeitschrift für Musik of October 1853:\n\n'...sooner or later … someone would and must appear, fated to give us the ideal expression of times, one who would not gain his mastery by gradual stages, but rather spring fully armed like Minerva from the head of Jove. And he has come, a young blood at whose cradle graces and heroes mounted guard. His name is Johannes Brahms…seated at the piano he began to reveal wondrous regions. We were drawn into ever more magical spheres. And the playing was absolutely inspired, transforming the piano into an orchestra of lamenting and jubilant voices.'\n\nBrahms met Hector Berlioz in Leipzig, who was impressed with the young genius and his music. 'I am grateful to you for having let me make the acquaintance of this diffident, audacious young man who has taken it into his head to make a new music. He will suffer greatly,' Berlioz wrote to the great violinist Joseph Joachim whom Brahms had recently befriended.\n\nThe Sonata in F-minor Op.5 is in five movements:\n\nAllegro maestoso\n\nThe nobility of Lake Geneva and the Dents du Midi in the distance from Glion above Montreux. The Chateau of Chillon so beloved of Lord Byron is in the bottom left-hand corner.\n\nThis early sonata was not well received, even considered a 'failure', the first movement as 'stiff and clumsy'. It is hard for me to credit such early descriptions of the imperial and noble theme of the opening.\n\nThe grandeur of this soundscape is depicted for me like a panorama of the monumental timelessness of the Dents du Midi in the Chablais Alps of the Swiss canton of Valais beyond Lake Geneva. I felt Liu captured the opening nobility well and soulfully and with great sensitivity. From the outset I felt this was to be a lyrical and poetic interpretation of the Brahms sonata, a romantic history of young love rather than a monumental philosophical expression of the darker conclusions of age.\n\nAndante. Andante espressivo — Andante molto\n\nThis deeply affecting romantic movement of the sonata is headed by a poem entitled Junge Liebe (Young Love) by Otto Inkermann who wrote under the pseudonym C.O. Sternau. The second movement was conceived with this quotation above the music and seems to follow the imagery, meaning and mood of the poem.\n\nLiu embraced the adorable melody of two illusioned lovers in an imagined song with a feeling of unsurpassed delicacy and tenderness. Her cantabile tone and refined touch were affecting and plumbed such emotional depths. I felt an intense, heartfelt, romantic yearning as we moved towards the unprecedented 'symphonic' exaltation and emotional resignation that is expressed in the Nachtstück song at the conclusion. The sentiment aroused was poignant and desperately moving.\n\nSuch surges of pure longing, such romantic emotion by Brahms must indicate something about his unrequited love for Clara Schumann. 'I would gladly write to you only by means of music, but I have things to say to you to-day which music could not express.' he wrote in 1854.\n\nBy 1855 this had blossomed into: 'I wish I could write to you as tenderly as I love you and tell you all the good things that I wish you. You are so infinitely dear to me, dearer than I can say. I should like to spend the whole day calling you endearing names and paying you compliments without ever being satisfied.'\n\nScherzo. Allegro energico avec trio\n\nLiu brought rhythmic and effervescent energy and drive to this movement. The central melody was particularly expressive in its sensitive legato phrasing.\n\nIntermezzo (Rückblick - Retrospect) Andante molto\n\nThere is deep Brahmsian gravitas in this movement, so full of nostalgic reminiscence and resignation. I see this movement not as funereal but the melancholic, even resentful reflections of enforced separation that follow any dwelling on the nature of love's passionate and tender utterances, imagined or otherwise consummated. The Beethoven fate motif Brahms evokes is inescapable.\n\nLiu brought a thoughtful depth to her interpretation at once eloquent and rather haunting. She created heartfelt nostalgia for past tender utterances between lovers with just a trace of resentful anger at the passing of now unattainable and possibly unrepeatable times.\n\nFinale. Allegro moderato ma rubato\n\nThis movement (a rondo) searches for its resolution almost in an improvisatory manner. Within it is embedded a musical cryptogram which was a personal musical motto of his close friend the violinist Joseph Joachim, the F–A–E theme, which translates into the thought-provoking and lovelorn conundrum, Frei aber einsam (Free but lonely). Liu created a wonderful variety of dramatic romantic resolution as the movement moved towards its triumphal and rhapsodic close.\n\nThis was a profoundly satisfying interpretation of bottomless romantic depth, a deeply satisfying interpretation of a monumental masterpiece that I shall always treasure in my memory of transcendent piano recitals. A priceless gem.

During that period, he also won a number of competitions, culminating with the winning first prize at the inaugural Paris Forum International de Clavecin in 1973.\n\nDuring his studies he founded the Collegium Musicum in Antwerp, conducting that ensemble and the Collegium Vocale to develop his interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. In 1985 (or 1987), he founded the orchestra Anima Eterna Bruge, a period instrument group, which he has conducted from the keyboard.\n\nJos Van Immerseel has gone on to establish a rare international career as a fortepianist and conductor specializing in music of the Baroque and Classical eras. A versatile musician who is accomplished on the organ and piano as well as harpsichord and fortepiano, he has in particular gained a reputation for his performances of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. He is in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he is known for his refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. Much of his performing is focused on music of the Classical and early Romantic eras. Vera Beths and Anner Bylsma regularly perform and record with him, as well, most notably in Schubert's chamber works. [Bach Cantatas Website].\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nIf one has closely read the 'bible' (originally published in French in Switzerland in 1970) Chopin Pianist and Teacher as Seen by his Pupils by Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger (Cambridge 1986) this arresting (and to some listeners arrestable) performance of Chopin, observed many of the first-hand accounts of Chopin's own playing and the general musical ambiance of the day. One must remember how far we are from the source of this music. These historical observations are often comprehensively ignored by modern 'virtuoso' performers on modern instruments in 2021 for entirely understandable musical, social, financial and career reasons.\n\nChopin once commented to his pupil Maria von Grewingk 'When you're at the piano, I give you full authority to do whatever you want; follow freely the ideal you have set for yourself and which you must feel within you;be bold and confident in your own powers and strength, and whatever you say will always be good.' He also observed: 'I merely suggest. It is up to the listener to complete the picture.'\n\nThis instrument is a copy of a grand piano by Fryderyk Buchholtz of Warsaw from c.1825–1826, held in the Museum of Local History in Kremenets, Ukraine.\n\nIt was based on the Viennese model which was popular at that time (built by the leading Viennese maker Conrad Graf, among others, and also employed by Polish makers). It was characterized by a case with rounded corners, resting on three turned column legs. The copy made by Paul McNulty is pyramid rosewood veneered, straight double-triple strung, with a Viennese action, hammer heads covered with several layers of leather, wedge dampers and a 6½-octave keyboard with the compass C1–f4. This keyboard is broader than the original Buchholtz keyboard (6 octaves, F1–f4), with several additional notes in the bass, making it possible to perform the works Chopin was writing in the late 1830s. This piano also has four pedals operating following stops: una corda, moderator, double moderator and damper.\n\nThe Chopin was played on this outstanding copy of the type owned by the Chopin family. It was clear from the outset that van Immerseel was concentrating on creating a beautiful tone, touch and almost linguistic expressiveness (of occasional incoherence) at the expense of the customary, extrovert virtuosity in Chopin, a feature which was remarkably absent. The tempo was considered and slow, the phrasing and rubato when present, deliberate. I received the distinct impression he was reading through this remarkable music deconstructively at leisure for his own musical discoveries rather than performing it for an audience. I found this whole rethinking process fascinating, instructive and individualistic in the extreme, even if disturbing. I will make a few comments on the pieces below.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nBallade in F major Op. 38\n\nChopin was working on the F major Ballade in Majorca. In January 1839, after his Pleyel pianino had arrived from Paris, he wrote to Julian Fontana ‘You’ll soon receive the Preludes and the Ballade’. And a few days after, when sending the manuscript of the Preludes: ‘In a couple of weeks, you’ll receive the Ballade, Polonaises and Scherzo.' So the conception took place in the atmosphere of a haunted monastery, threatened by untamed nature. Here was conceived the idea of contrasting a gentle and melodic siciliana with a demonic presto con fuoco – the music of those ‘impassioned episodes’, as Schumann referred to them.\n\nI felt van Immerseel gave us a definitely literary, narrative view of this work far more emphatically than most. There was a slow and deliberate unfolding of the 'opera'. The Leipzig encounter with Chopin Schumann experienced in 1840 is instructive. 'A new Chopin Ballade has appeared’, he noted in his diary. ‘It is dedicated to me and gives me greater joy than if I’d received an order from some ruler’. He remembered a conversation with Chopin: ‘At that time he also mentioned that certain poems of Mickiewicz had suggested his ballade to him.’ So the narrative balladic tradition did underlie this conception but as an inspiration, naturally as an organic growth and not in any programmatic way.\n\nWaltz in A flat major Op. 34 No. 1\n\nThe first version of the A flat major Waltz, Op. 34 No. 1 was written in Dĕčín, Bohemia, at the castle of the Thun-Hohenstein princes. In the summer of 1835, returning from a meeting with his parents in Karlovy Vary, Chopin stopped with the family of three sibling pupils. One of them, Josefina, would become the dedicatee of this Waltz. This is not a virtuoso's waltz but flows along lyrically as if for a cultivated amateur (the dedicatee) with a delicacy, tenderness, poetry and a waltz rhythm that Immerseel captured perfectly.\n\nBerceuse in D flat major Op. 57\n\nThe lullaby delicacy of sonambulant touch, the fragile murmuring of a mother, that van Immerseel achieved on the Buchholtz was magical. It is impossible to achieve such an ultra-pianissimo on the modern Steinway. Chopin was often criticized for playing too softly - why Berlioz commented he needed to place his ear against the piano case to listen to the rustling of elves!\n\nNocturne in C minor Op. 48 No. 1\n\nMarcel Antoni Szulc (1818-1898) worked as a teacher of classic languages and French in the St. Marie Magdalene high school and sporadically engaging himself as a sometime music critic. He conceived of this nocturne as ‘this magnificent hymn is proclaimed not by a feeble piano, but by a mighty organ – midst the sound of trombones and kettle drums’.\n\nThe fine Polish musicologist Tadeusz Andrzej Zieliński (1931-2012) felt that the melody of this Nocturne ‘sounds like a lofty, inspired song filled with the gravity of its message, genuine pathos and a tragic majesty’.\n\nIn this work I fear van Immerseel failed to achieve the monumental stature of this great work by adopting a rather soft dynamic.\n\nScherzo in B flat minor Op. 31\n\nThere was one aspect of this scherzo that van Immerseel understood better than anyone I have ever heard. That is the opening repeated triplet group.\n\n'This apparently so simple phrase could never be played to Chopin's satisfaction. 'It must be a question.' taught Chopin; and it was never played questioningly enough, never soft enough, never round enough (tombé), as he said, never sufficiently weighted (important). 'It must be the house of the dead,' he once said [...in his lessons] I saw Chopin dwell at length on this bar and at each of its reappearances. 'That's the key to the whole piece,' he would say. Yet the triplet group is generally snatched or swallowed. Chopin was just as exacting over the simple quaver accompaniment of the cantilena, as well as the cantilena itself.' (Russian writer Wilhelm von Lenz 1809-1883).\n\nI felt that van Immerseel understood this existential significance of the key triplet figure perfectly which gave an unaccustomed gravity and atmosphere of darker philosophical intent to the entire work that followed. Alright, it may not have been performed with the ultra-virtuosity we have become accustomed to and with more than enough solecisms, but even so we received a worthwhile threatening and ominous vision of this much maligned and often performed work, known informally and possibly pejoratively as the 'governess scherzo' (every musically accomplished governess of aristocratic children played it).\n\nFerenc Liszt\n\nBénédiction de Dieu dans la solitude; Funérailles from the cycle Harmonies poétiques et religieuses III S.173\n\nVan Immerseel then changed to another period instrument, an Erard of 1849, for one of the most extraordinary and convincing performances of Liszt I have ever heard. The colours, timbre, dynamic variation, texture and character of registers he extracted from this instrument made me feel I had never heard it played before, despite hearing it so often not only in this festival but in piano competitions in Warsaw performed on period instruments.\n\nThe historical background to Funérailles is important in order to understand the inspiration and sound quality that illustrates the deep tragedy that moved Liszt to write this work. The revolution in France, especially Paris, in February 1848, roused the Magyar national spirit of Hungarians in imitation, those who had been suffering under the yoke of the Hapsburg empire. However, the many ethnic groups within this empire were much divided against each other which doomed the uprising from the outset.\n\nDuring the war that transpired between Hungary and Austria, great atrocities and cruelties were perpetrated. As Liszt and Carolyne set out for Weimar in April 1848, the darkness of war had begun to settle over the land. Liszt wrote in some skepticism : I can hardly see any prospect of a favorable outcome from that ardent passion for clannish patriotism, which sows the wind only to reap the whirlwind!\n\nHe was greatly grieved over the outcome of the war especially when on October 6th 1849, the Hungarian Prime Minister Lajos Batthyány and thirteen Hungarian generals were summarily executed at Arad. This atrocity was the catalyst for Funérailles according to the convincing account offered by the great Liszt scholar and biographer Alan Walker.\n\nThe horrors van Immerseel extracted, that groaned from this Erard in a fractured, dark, growling timbre from the characteristically straight-strung lower register, produced an atmosphere of overwhelming darkness and tragedy from the tomb of huge double octaves. My hair was set on end by the ethereal pianissimo tremolos during this performance. This sepulchral Gothic effect was created in a way impossible with the homogenized sound of a modern instrument.\n\nDeux légendes, S. 175, No. 1 François d’Assise: la prédication aux oiseaux\n\nThe Deux Légendes of Liszt are two of the most original pieces in the entire piano repertoire. So rarely performed in recital - a unique experience. Sacheverell Sitwell, with great artistic perception, feels they belong to the art of the Jesuits, to the architecture and painting of the Seicento. We are reminded of the Italian Jesuit brother, Baroque painter, architect, decorator, stage designer, and art theoretician Padre Andrea Pozzo (1642-1709) and of the Baroque architect Baldassare Longhena (1598-1692).\n\nVan Immerseel produced the most extraordinary ultra-pianissimo celestial, heavenly, disembodied ethereal sound of birdsong in the extreme upper register of the Erard I have ever encountered. It appeared to be a type of divine descent of the incorporeal. One could imagine the iridescent colours as the plumage of various species of birds was displayed when they alighted and fluttered their feathers. Their various calls and chirping in answer to the holy words of St. Francis was so clear, their 'conversation' theatrical and fluent. Beneath this vocal activity was laid the serious immanence of the sermon.\n\nVon der Wiege bis zum Grabe, S. 512\n\nFrom the Cradle to the Grave, after a drawing by Mihály Zichy depicts three stages of existence: birth, the struggle for being, and death. Liszt wrote his last symphonic poem in inspiration (here rarely performed in the solo piano version).\n\nFrom the Cradle to the Grave Drawing by Mihály Zichy (1881)\n\nCzárdás obstiné (S. 225)\n\nThe final two late works, van Immerseel revealed a different, less seductive, almost brutal side to the sound of the Erard, especially the Hungarian dance known as the Czárdás. The colours and rustic timbre he extracted added an bucolic atmosphere one could palpably feel - astonishing in a word that gave these works a unique and arresting character.\n\nHis encore was rather unfamiliar to me, but I think it was a sketch for an Hungarian Rhapsody. Perhaps from the Liszt Tasso Sketchbook, the Hungarian Rhapsody XII Prose des Morts. Incredibly effective whatever!\n\nThis remarkable recital was so individualistic it gave much ground for analytical thought and took one out of the common run of recitals with a vengeance. I felt in some way were were being given abstract, yet recognizable forms of familiar (and some unfamiliar) works like the reality dislocation of a late Turner watercolour - recognizable in subject but viewed through a unique vision or prism. This recital was certainly not the usual standardization of approach to familiar works. I found my mind being removed in many ways from the vast virtuosic talents of the performer (our usual preoccupation in recitals in 2021) and being drawn unresistant into the depths of the music itself.\n\nIt is of identical construction to the instruments familiar to Fryderyk Chopin. Its composite frame comprises a hitch pin-block (the strings are stretched between the hitch pin-block and the wrest pin-block), six stress bars screwed to the hitch pin-block (counterbalancing the combined force of the taut strings, reaching up to 20 tonnes) and a bar brace in the treble. It is the predecessor of the cast iron piano frame used today. The keyboard covers 7 octaves (A2–a4), as on modern concert grand pianos. The instrument is straight-strung in single-, double- and triple-string unisons. It has an English action with double repetition and una corda and damper pedals, and the case is veneered with rosewood. The original, historical substance of the piano is preserved in its entirety, with the exception of the elements routinely changed with use. The instrument was restored using identical elements, made from the same raw materials and with the same technology, as in the mid nineteenth century. The piano was a gift for the Fryderyk Chopin Institute from the Ryszard Krauze Foundation.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiFArdDFZDQ\n\nSunday 22.08.21 17:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nPiano recital\n\nEric Lu piano\n\nFranz Schubert\n\nAllegretto in C Minor, D.915\n\nFerdinand Walcher (1799-1873), was a lawyer who worked for the Austrian War Office in the section devoted to Naval matters. He was a member of the musical circle surrounding Schubert, becoming a close personal friend of the composer by 1827. He was an amateur singer, possessed of a low tenor voice and renowned for singing Schubert’s songs ‘most beautifully.’ In May 1827, Walcher was posted to Venice, where the Imperial Fleet had its base. A month or so before Schubert had been a torchbearer at Beethoven's funeral (Who can do anything after Beethoven? - Schubert wrote to Josef von Spaun). In many ways perhaps this farewell to Walcher may have been also an adieu to Beethoven,\n\nWalcher returned to Vienna regularly, attending a performance of Ständchen, D. 920 in January 1828. One audience member recalled that Walcher had to go and get Schubert from a nearby beer cellar, as he had forgotten all about the concert. Walcher developed under Archduke Karl and then his son, Archduke Albrecht, eventually being knighted in 1865. (grateful thanks for this information to Maureen Buja).\n\nEric Lu brought his own particularly characteristic Schubert thoughtful nostalgic tone and touch to the piece, the singing quality he deeply understands from Schubert songs and poetry that the composer set to music. Expressively he brought an undercurrent of melancholy to the contrast of happiness and dreamlike joy that invests the simple opening statement. This was sometimes shadowed like a passing cloud across the sun by the harsh realities of life - a constant trope in the Schubertian musical imagination.\n\nFryderyk Chopin\n\nNocturne in C minor Op. 48 No. 1\n\nThis was a deeply moving performance that achieved almost Olympian stature of expression as we were taken on a great emotional and philosophical journey. A rhapsodic yet contemplative portrait of the soul's anguish, struggling under a degree of anger and resentment with the inevitable necessity of spiritual resignation to fate and destiny. A remarkable experience of heightened reality indeed.\n\nThe Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog c.1818 Caspar David Friedrich\n\nFranz Schubert\n\nPiano Sonata in A minor, Op. posth. 143, D 784\n\nAlfred Brendel wrote of Schubert: 'Schubert may well be the most astonishing phenomenon in musical history. The richness of what he accomplished in a life of merely thirty-one years defies comparison.’\n\nIn 1823, the year in which he wrote the Sonata in A minor, D. 784, Schubert's health was worrying. The venereal infection (syphilis) that he had contracted led to a period in hospital and to thoughts of inevitable and unavoidable death in the face of the lack of antibiotics. This disease would eventually kill him. In February he had written the sonata, but he was able to work in the spring and early summer (even in hospital) on the song cycle Die schöne Müllerin. In February he had written the Wanderer Fantasy and had also arranged a performance of his opera Alfonso and Estrella.\n\nSchubert, under the profound influence of Beethoven, had been experimenting with the classical form of the piano sonata. It has not always been the case that the sonatas of Schubert were considered close in expressiveness and depth to the sonatas of his God Beethoven. However Schubert uses different means and structure in what emerges as a pattern of Romantic 'psychological symbolism'. So much is clear in his songs based on the associative power of literature and poetry. In his sonatas too the seductive, vulnerable lyricism of dreams and the imaginative flights of the artistic temperament are at moments brutally interrupted by the emergence of the grim, inflexible and brutal reality of the world. The tenderness of a pastel drawing or watercolour suddenly contrasted with the concrete, forceful depiction of an oil painting.\n\nThe A minor Sonata in three movements, opens in a funereal mood and with the darkest of presentiments. The sonata contains only three movements and lacks the conventional scherzo which gives the work unusual emotional concentration. Lu instinctively understands the moody metaphysics of Schubert, the fatalism, the depths of his passionate life and inevitability of the heavy 'mortality tread' of this opening. He also understands the unique tone and touch required of this emotional composer. The contrasts and expressive, almost agonizing lurches of psychological mood, were hypnotic. He brought a fine and sensitive contrast in the blithe E major second subject.\n\nAlfred Einstein in his book Schubert (London 1951, p.245) draws our attention to the second subject in the major of the two outer movements as 'visions of paradise', lyrical and frail dreams of departed love or lost love reminiscent of the yearning mood of the song cycle Winterreise (a penetrating observation from the American author William Kinderman). The artist's dreams are ruptured by dark, ungovernable and tumultuous minor mode forces.\n\nThe slow movement, marked Andante, is in F major and follows its opening phrase with reflective understatement as the movement develops into rhapsodic declamation with marked inspiration of song. The final movement has a principal subject in rapid, highly emotionally agitated triplet rhythm, contrasted with a lyrical secondary theme in F major that Lu made sing with superb cantabile. We meander through remoter keys and the turbulent return of the first subject. Dance rhythms and a brief hallucinatory and momentary return to the secret despair of the opening bareness. A magnificent performance that elevated to work to a stature of great nobility of spirit in the face of harsh destiny and the inevitable decline of life force to which we are all subjected.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFranz Schubert\n\nSonata in A major, (D. 959)\n\nThe late sonatas were written during the last prolific months of Schubert's all too brief life, this one in 1828, mere months before his death. His sonatas were neglected until the twentieth century as they were thought to be inferior to those of Beethoven. Of course they possess the unique voice of a musical genius. Beethoven had died the previous year and in some ways Schubert felt he had inherited his mantle. As Alfred Brendel has pointed out, the three late sonatas (a sonata trilogy in fact), are closely connected motivically and tonally.\n\nThe opening Allegro suggested chamber music for strings, but surely the pivot of this sonata, on which the whole structure revolves, is the immortal Andantino movement in F sharp minor. The mesmeric main theme reminds one of Schubert's Heine songs and Der Leiermann from Winterreise. The melancholic contemplation, even obsession, was ever present. Lu achieved a degree of ferocious intensity at the climax.\n\nAlfred Brendel found a parallel with this movement and the painting The Third of May, 1808 by Francisco Goya, where the brutality of the firing squad and the defenseless human target are contrasted. The Scherzo. Allegro vivace- Trio and Beethovenian Rondo. Allegretto have a far more positive life outlook than that depicted in the bleak Andantino. The silences Lu brought to the conclusion were so eloquent of existential uncertainties before the passionate, almost desperate grasp at life at the Coda.\n\nThere is really nothing left for me to say about this deeply satisfying and spiritual performance.\n\nEncores in lyrical performances of great simplicity : Kind im Einschlummern (Child Falling Asleep) and Der Dichter spricht (The Poet Speaks) from Schumann's Kinderszenen (Scenes from Childhood)\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSaturday 21.08.21 21:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nChamber concert\n\nBomsori Kim violin\n\nRafał Blechacz piano\n\nI was unable for personal reasons to attend this concert so I am afraid the review is absent until I hear a later broadcast perhaps\n\nLudwig van Beethoven\n\nViolin Sonata in D major, Op. 12 No. 1\n\nJohannes Brahms\n\nViolin Sonata No. 3 in D minor, Op. 108\n\nClaude Debussy\n\nViolin Sonata in G minor\n\nKarol Szymanowski\n\nSonata in D minor Op. 9\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSaturday 21.08.21 17:00\n\nWarsaw Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nLieder recital\n\nInternet broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eOtNzmXBCA\n\nChristoph Prégardien tenor\n\nJulian Prégardien tenor\n\nMichael Gees piano\n\nThis was a unique, spiritual and humanly uplifting recital that restored one's faith in the power of familial love and human nature. A unique musical and personal connection of great intimacy between father and son. One truly needs such reassurances today. Readers of my other reviews of Christoph Prégardien will realize how highly I value his talents and what special occasions his recitals have become for me.\n\nOn 17th August 2019 at this same festival I wrote:\n\nOn this rarest of occasions, I had one of the deepest artistic experiences of my musical life. The renowned lyric tenor Christoph Prégardien sang with such subtlety and finesse the audience were reduced to utter stillness by the intense poetry of the performance and the meditative atmosphere this great artist created.

In June 2017, at the Frauenkirche in Dresden, I heard him sing madrigals and operatic excerpts with his son Julien in a superb concert to commemorate the 450th birthday of Claudio Monterverdi. They were accompanied by Anima Eterna Brugge conducted by Jos van Immerseel. Father and son touched foreheads at the conclusion which was a deeply moving gesture.\n\nA deeply moving interpretation that lifted the Schubert song Erlkönig Op. 1 (D. 328) to the heights of artistic and metaphysical transcendence,was when father and son Prégardien sang their respective dialogues that appear in the poem. This dramatization by father and son was poetically and artistically transformational. [See English translated of the poem below].\n\nThis concert was an excursion through the Classical-Romantic song repertoire, but unusual in that many songs had been arranged as duos.All wonderfully sung.
