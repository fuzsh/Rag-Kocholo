        "text": "Vaudevillian, song-and-dance man, tent show magician and juggler Bert Kalmar turned to writing parodies for the stage after a knee injury put an end to his performing career. However, at the urging of composer Ted Snyder, he soon put his talents to better use as a writer of popular songs. A chance encounter with pianist cum 'song plugger' Harry Ruby at Snyder & Waterson, a Tin Pan Alley publishing firm, led to what was to become a famous partnership. From 1918, Kalmar & Ruby turned out numerous hit songs, including \"Three Little Words\", \"I Want to Be Loved By You\" (famously warbled by Marilyn Monroe in Manche mögen's heiß (1959)), \"Who's Sorry Now\" (from Eine Nacht in Casablanca (1946), also a huge 1958 hit for Connie Francis), \"A Kiss to Build a Dream On\" (featured in Schlaflos in Seattle (1993), and many, many more.\n\nBefore moving to Hollywood in 1930, the team turned out prodigious sketches for Broadway shows, such as Earl Carroll's Vanities, as well as providing scores for musical comedies. They formed a particularly gainful association with The Marx Brothers, beginning with Animal Crackers (1930) (both stage and screen versions). The song \"Hooray for Captain Spalding\" was to become Groucho Marx's personal anthem over the next four decades and a valuable source of royalties for Kalmar & Ruby. In addition to their songs, the duo also concocted the madcap plots for Die Marx Brothers in der Uni (1932), Die Marx Brothers im Krieg (1933) and the Eddie Cantor farce The Kid from Spain (1932).\n\nThough the partnership endured well into the 1940's, it had undoubtedly suffered its ups and downs. These were in part detailed in the musical biopic Drei kleine Worte (1950), in which Kalmar (who had died three years earlier) was played by Fred Astaire and Ruby by Red Skelton. Production values were tops, the musical numbers were superbly staged. As to the story - well, that was pure Hollywood fiction. From the supposed split-up over a triviality, to the reconciliation affected by Kalmar's and Ruby's wives, it was all strictly formula material. Not to mention the dancing (brilliantly, as always) by Astaire (which the real Kalmar with his bum knee would have been hard pressed to do).\n\nIn the end, all that really matters is the enduring popularity of the songs and the fortuitous combination of talent which created them.\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter S. J. Perelman was one of the great American humorists, a master at short fiction involving word play and satire who influenced countless American humorists, including Woody Allen. He was born Simeon Joseph Perleman (though known as Sidney or Sydney to family and friends) on February 1, 1904 in Brooklyn, New York, and was raised in Providence, Rhode Island, where he attended Brown University.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, he became a cartoonist and humorist. His friends would include Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker, two of the key members of the famed Algonquin Round Table. (Perleman was never a member, though caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, who illustrated some of Perleman's books, once created a cartoon called \"Algonquin Round Table with S. J. Perelman Sitting in Booth Nearby\" the year of his death.)\n\nHe made his reputation writing short stories, satires and humorous pieces for \"The New Yorker\" and other top magazines. He described his short humorist pieces as feuilletons (French for \"little leaves\"), referencing a genre of French literature. He would often write parodies of popular culture, such as the hard-boiled writing of Raymond Chandler, or tales of his misadventures on his farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He began publishing his collected feuilletons in book form starting in the 1940s.\n\nPerleman made his Broadway debut writing the book for the Bobby Clark revue \"Walk a Little Faster\" that played over three months in the 1932-33 season. The following season his play 'All Good Americans\", co-written with his wife Laura (the sister of novelist 'Nathanel West') was not a success, lasting only 40 performances. Seven years later, the couple's \"The Night Before Christmas\" lasted just 22 performances. In 1943, Perleman was finally associated with a hit with the musical \"One Touch of Venus\", for which he wrote the book with his friend Ogden Nash. With a music by Kurt Weil and a production staged by the great Elia Kazan (arguably the greatest director in Broadway history), the show ran for 567 performances. His last outing on Broadway, the 1963 comedy \"The Beauty Part\", returned to his record of failure, lasting only 85 performances.\n\nPerleman had more luck with the movies. Perleman's first two screenplays were for the Marx Brothers' classics Die Marx Brothers auf See (1931) and Die Marx Brothers in der Uni (1932). He toiled as a screenwriter during the Hollywood studio system off and on from the early 1930s to the early '40s, as did his brother-in-law West. He won his Oscar for his last screenplay, for 'Michael Todd''s blockbuster In 80 Tagen um die Welt (1956), winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1956.\n\nS.J. Perleman was given a special National Book Award in 1978. He died in New York City on October 17, 1979 at the age of 75.\n\nEdward \"Eddie\" Cline began his career in the film business as one of the Keystone Kops. The former vaudevillian appeared sporadically in films as an actor until 1922, but became increasingly active behind the camera as a gagman and scenario writer for Mack Sennett. From 1916 he worked on a steady stream of two-reelers, either as director or assistant director, for such comedians as Buster Keaton, Ford Sterling and Mack Swain. An expert in slapstick comedy with an unerring sense of timing, Cline was consistently in demand by Hollywood studios during the 1920s and served short-term contracts with Fox (the \"Sunshine\" comedies), Pathe, First National, MGM and Paramount.\n\nDuring the sound era he had more periods of steadier employment, particularly at Universal (1939-45). He became the favorite director of comedian W.C. Fields. In fact, Fields would often demand Cline's participation, much to the consternation of the studios. In one instance, director Edward Sedgwick was assigned to the Fields comedy Ehrlich währt am längsten (1939), but was replaced by Cline just two days into shooting because he couldn't get along with Fields. Cline frequently worked out comedy routines by standing in for the Fields character in rehearsals. As for being able to get along with the notoriously prickly star, Cline believed in just \"letting him run with it\" and later editing out any unwanted ad-libs (which Fields had a habit of inserting at the end of his lines). Unfortunately, those famous ad-libs often tended to crack up the camera crew and ruin the take . . .\n\nCline directed Fields in some of his funniest comedies, including Mein kleiner Gockel (1940) and Der Bankdetektiv (1940) (the climactic car chase was largely due to Cline's input). He teamed up once more with Keaton for the anachronistic slapstick farce Die Unschuld und der Bösewicht (1940). Cline's output diminished by the mid-'40s and he retired from directing in 1951.\n\nAs 'Harry Ruby', Harry Rubenstein was a 'song plugger' for Gus Edwards and for George Gershwin at Jerome H. Remick's, the Detroit music publishing firm. He had unfulfilled ambitions to become a professional baseball player and had previously worked the vaudeville circuit as a pianist with The Bootblack Trio and The Messenger Boys Trio. Ruby's luck was to change after meeting the lyricist Bert Kalmar at a Tin Pan Alley publishing house. By 1918, the duo had formed a songwriting partnership which was to endure for almost three decades, resulting in numerous popular hits for Broadway shows and movies. Some of their best-known numbers included \"I Wanna Be Loved by You\", \"Who's Sorry Now?\", \"Three Little Words\", \"Give Me the Simple Life\", \"A Kiss to Build a Dream On\" and many more. A fictionalised biopic of Kalmar & Ruby, Drei kleine Worte (1950) (in which Ruby was played by Red Skelton), was released by MGM three years after Kalmar's death. Ruby lived on until 1974, but managed just one hit song on his own, the 1949 chart topper \"Maybe It's Because\".\n\nFollowing a two-year apprenticeship under Cecil B. DeMille as assistant director, Samuel Grosvenor Wood had the good fortune to have assigned to him two of the biggest stars at Paramount during their heyday: Wallace Reid (between 1919 and 1920) and Gloria Swanson (from 1921 to 1923). By the time his seven-year contract with Paramount expired, the former real estate dealer had established himself as one of Hollywood's most reliable (if not individualistic) feature directors. Not bad for a former real estate broker and small-time theatrical thesp. In 1927, Wood joined MGM and remained under contract there until 1939. During this tenure he was very much in sync with the studio's prevalent style of production, reliably turning out between two and three films a year (of which the majority were routine subjects).\n\nMost of his films in the 1920s were standard fare and it was not until he directed two gems with The Marx Brothers, Skandal in der Oper (1935) and Das Große Rennen (1937) that his career picked up again. Looking at the finished product it is difficult to reconcile this to Groucho Marx finding Wood \"rigid and humorless\". Maybe, this assessment was due to Wood being vociferously right-wing in his personal views which would not have sat well with the famous comedian. His testimonies in 1947 before the House Un-American Activities Committee certainly gained Wood more enemies than friends within the industry.\n\nRegardless of his personality or his habitually having to shoot each scene twenty times over, Wood turned out some very powerful dramatic films during the last ten years of his life, beginning with Auf Wiedersehen, Mr. Chips (1939). This popular melodrama earned him his first Academy Award nomination. At RKO, he coaxed an Oscar-winning performance out of Ginger Rogers (and was again nominated himself) for Fräulein Kitty (1940). Ronald Reagan gave, arguably, his best performance in Kings Row (1942) under Wood's direction. His most expensive (and longest, at 170 minutes) assignment took him back to Paramount. This was Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War drama Wem die Stunde schlägt (1943), bought for $150,000 (De Mille was originally slated as director). In spite of editorial incongruities and the relatively uneven pace, the picture turned out to be the biggest (and last) hit of Wood's career.\n\nSam Wood died of a heart attack on September 22 1949. He has a star on the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nRobert Florey became infatuated with Hollywood while in his teens. By the time he set off for America in the early 1920s he had written articles on film for Cinemagazine, La Cinematographie Francaise and Le Technicien du Film, acted and directed one-reel shorts in Switzerland and worked as an assistant for Louis Feuillade at his studio in Nice. Sent to Hollywood as a correspondent for one of his French publications, he decided to settle down and learn the film business \"from the bottom up\", first as a gag writer, then as director of foreign publicity for Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Rudolph Valentino. In 1924 he was signed by MGM as assistant director on a two-year contract, moving on to Paramount as full director in 1928. During this period of apprenticeship he learned the tricks of his trade under such experienced craftsmen as King Vidor and Josef von Sternberg. His first claim to directing fame were two highly acclaimed avant-garde short films, The Life and Death of 9413, a Hollywood Extra (1928), and Symphonie der Wolkenkratzer (1929) -- both heavily influenced by German expressionist cinema. Florey was also tasked with co-directing (alongside Joseph Santley) the first wacky comedy with The Marx Brothers, The Cocoanuts (1929), shot at Paramount's Astoria studio, near Broadway (Groucho Marx was not impressed with either director; he once said about them that \"one of them didn't understand Harpo [Harpo Marx] and the other one didn't understand English\").\n\nAfter a spell at the German studio UFA in 1929, Florey joined Universal in 1931. His request to write and direct Frankenstein (1931) with Bela Lugosi was initially accepted. However, producer Carl Laemmle Jr. ultimately disliked Lugosi 's make-up for the monster, and Lugosi himself resented not having a speaking part. Much of Florey's script also ended up on the cutting room floor, except for several key ingredients, such as the ending in the windmill. As consolation for missing out on the prestigious assignment (which went to James Whale), Florey was given a lesser project, Das Geheimnis des Dr. Mirakel (1932), with Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle, a demented Darwinian scientist who crossbreeds humans with apes. The stylized, distorted buildings of Florey's Parisian sets were once again reminiscent of German expressionism, notably Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920). Florey, from then on, was set on a career of helming second features for Warner Brothers (1933-35), Paramount (1935-40), Columbia (1941), Warner Brothers again (1942-46) and United Artists (1948-50). As a result of his affinity with horror and science-fiction, he did his best work in these genres. Die Bestie mit den fünf Fingern (1946) has become something of a cult classic and is notable for some clever montage and animation effects, as well as an effectively eerie atmosphere. Unfortunately, the anti-climactic downbeat ending (a result of studio interference) rather lessened the picture's overall impact.\n\nIn 1951, Florey stopped making features and became prodigiously active as a director of television episodes. In 1953 he won the first Directors Guild of America Award bestowed for TV direction, for The Last Voyage (1953). He also wrote eight influential books on the history of cinema.\n\nHumorist, playwright and screenwriter Norman Krasna went to great lengths planning for a career in law. He attended New York University, Columbia University and St. John's University law school but then abruptly changed his plans and started work as a copy boy at a New York newspaper. He had a brief stint as a drama critic for the Evening Graphic and wrote a column for the Exhibitor's Herald World and this likely awakened his interest in the film business. He was soon off to L.A. and finagled a job in the Warner Brothers publicity department. Upon seeing his first filmed play, The Front Page (1931), he decided there and then to become a playwright. Having obtained a copy of the original script, he re-typed it over and over to get the hang of style and methodology. This approach seems to have worked since Krasna soon published his first play (the comedy \"Louder,Please\") which opened on Broadway by November 1931.\n\nWhile not a huge hit, the play led first to a screenwriting contract with Columbia, then in 1935 with MGM. At MGM, Krasna met Groucho Marx and the two became lifelong friends (in 1948, they wrote a play together, \"Time for Elizabeth\", which had a brief run on Broadway). Within a relatively short period of time Krasna acquired a reputation for writing intelligent, witty scripts quickly. This ability naturally endeared him to thrifty-minded producers. He also had a penchant for clever one-liners (it would have been fun to sit in on conversational banter between Krasna and Groucho). Krasna did not only confine himself to screwball comedy but also occasionally turned out good original dramatic material such as Fritz Lang's indictment of mob justice, Blinde Wut (1936). He penned Mr. und Mrs. Smith (1941) for Alfred Hitchcock, wrote the perennial family favourite Weiße Weihnachten (1954), and the glossy romantic comedy Indiskret (1958) based on his own 1953 play \"Kind Sir\". For the most part, the accolades kept coming for his sophisticated comedies - often featuring mistaken identity (Die große und die kleine Welt (1956)), irascible, or curmudgeonly characters (Charles Coburn in Mary und der Millionär (1941) and Der Pilot und die Prinzessin (1943)), or men-of-the-world cured of their cynicism through love (Cary Grant in 'Indiscreet'). Krasna won an Oscar for 'Princess O'Rourke', one of four films he also directed. While most of his plots are now somewhat dated, his dialogue rarely fails to entertain.\n\nAfter leaving MGM in 1938, Krasna worked for the next twelve years as a free-lance writer dividing his time between Hollywood and Broadway. In 1950, he formed an independent production company with charismatic producer Jerry Wald at RKO. The enterprise was sadly short-lived. Just four films were produced out of a total of sixty originally stipulated. Krasna then went on to produce several films for various studios, including Vor dem neuen Tag (1952), which featured a young Marilyn Monroe. He also wrote Marilyn's penultimate film Machen wir's in Liebe (1960). That same year, he was honoured with the Laurel Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Screen Writer's Guild. Krasna retired in 1964 and died twenty years later in Los Angeles, aged 74.\n\nAlbert \"Al\" Boasberg, a luminary in the world of comedy and screenwriting, left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry during the early 20th century. Hailing from the vibrant city of Buffalo, New York, Boasberg's creative genius became synonymous with some of the era's greatest comedians, forging lasting connections with legends such as George Burns, Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton.\n\nIn the bustling days of Vaudeville, Boasberg's journey into the world of entertainment began at a sheet music store in Buffalo, where his knack for crafting witty gags drew entertainers seeking comedic inspiration. As fate would have it, a chance encounter with George Burns while peddling jewelry backstage at a local theater catapulted Boasberg into the heart of show business. Burns recognized Boasberg's talent, offering payment for polishing an old joke and sparking a series of encounters that would shape Boasberg's illustrious career.\n\nA prolific contributor to Hollywood's golden age, Boasberg's creative prowess graced over 60 features and shorts between 1926 and 1937. His timeless collaboration with Buster Keaton resulted in the iconic film \"The General,\" a masterpiece that, despite its initial box office struggles in 1926, is now hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nBeyond his contributions to the Marx Brothers' comedic repertoire, including the 1935 hit \"A Night at The Opera,\" and the 1937 classic \"A Day at the Races,\" Boasberg also showcased his directorial talents in seventeen short films and a feature. Notably, his lone feature, adapted from the radio serial \"Myrt and Marge,\" introduced audiences to the act that would later evolve into The Three Stooges.\n\nBoasberg's impact extended even into the 21st century when a snippet of his work found its place in the acclaimed film \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" First released in 2000, the movie pays homage to the enduring legacy of Boasberg's comedic contributions.\n\nTragically, Al Boasberg's brilliant career was cut short at the age of 45, just as he was on the brink of further collaborations with emerging Hollywood stars of the late 1930s and 40s. In the days leading up to his untimely demise, he was diligently crafting scripts for Jack Benny's radio show. On June 18, 1937, one day after signing a new contract, Boasberg suffered a fatal heart attack at his Beverly Hills home. His final resting place is in his beloved hometown at Forest Lawn Cemetery, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire laughter and admiration in the hearts of comedy enthusiasts worldwide."
