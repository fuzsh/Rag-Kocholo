Fields, and the Marx Brothers, whose 1933 classic, Duck Soup, McCarey directed. Later, as either writer or director, McCarey was responsible for a number of classic films, including Ruggles of Red Gap, The Awful Truth, Love Affair, Make Way for Tomorrow, My Favorite Wife, and An Affair to Remember. His 1944 film, Going My Way, was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won seven, including the first \"triple crown\" awarded to the same person for writing, producing and directing. Its sequel, The Bells of St. Mary's, received eight nominations, including Best Picture and Director.\""
