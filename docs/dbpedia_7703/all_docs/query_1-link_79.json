        "text": "Gustav said:\n\n...Stoo and Saboteur for your lists because I haven't even heard of some of those.\n\nWe hadn't heard of them either until...well, we did. So I'm glad to pass along what I can. Though, I'm sure you haven't heard of some of them simply because they were lost in the transition to DVD from VHS. The Mob was just released on DVD; Cry Danger still isn't on DVD; and I don't think Mr. Dynamite was ever released on video.\n\nStoo said:\n\nNice list, Sabbie.\n\nYours too, Stoo. I was torn between putting together a purely pulp adventure list or a film noir list, but decided on diversifying it a bit. It's still too crime heavy, but 1940-58 was the proverbial Golden Age of film noir.\n\nAnd here's a few more for anybody that's interested.\n\n1930s\n\n\"Barbary Coast\" (1935)\n\n\"The Dawn Patrol\" (1930)\n\n\"Scarface\" (1932)\n\n\"Okay, America\" (1932)\n\n\"Roadhouse Nights\" (1930)\n\n\"Little Caesar\" (1930)\n\n\"Captain Blood\" (1935)\n\n\"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang\" (1932)\n\n1940s\n\n\"High Tide\" (1947)\n\n\"The Black Swan\" (1942)\n\n\"The Blue Dahlia\" (1946)\n\n\"The Killers\" (1946)\n\n\"Border Incident\" (1949)\n\n\"Meet me in St. Louis\" (1944)\n\n\"Miracle on 34th St.\" (1947)\n\n\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)\n\n1950s\n\n\"Damn Yankees!\" (1958)\n\n\"High Society\" (1956)\n\n\"An American in Paris\" (1951)\n\n\"Gun Crazy\" (1950)\n\n\"On Dangerous Ground\" (1952)\n\n\"The Devil Makes Three (1952)\n\n\"Funny Face\" (1957)\n\n\"Naked Alibi\" (1954)\n\nI owe you a response here, and I'll do more, but here's the 30s, which is easier, since I know it the least of the three. I'll also stick to Hollywood film, since it seems to suit the question. And since I guess I'll make some rules to myself, to allow myself to stretch them, I'm allowing myself as many as three period pictures* and one non-star picture^ in each set of ten. Period pictures reflect, sometimes more strongly, what an era cares about, while the other exemption allows a worthy other to be included.\n\n1930s:\n\nThe Public Enemy (William Wellman, 1931)\n\n-Exemplary pre-Code gangster picture w/ James Cagney & Jean Harlow\n\nI Was a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (Mervyn LeRoy, 1931)\n\n-Socially conscious prison picture w/ Paul Muni\n\nDinner at Eight (George Cukor, 1933)\n\n-All-star ensemble comedy/drama w/ Lionel Barrymore, John Barrymore, Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, and Jean Harlow\n\nDuck Soup (Leo McCarey, 1933)\n\n-Anarchic, satiric comedy w/ the Marx Brothers & Margaret Dumont\n\nIt Happened One Night (Frank Capra, 1934)\n\n-Populist screwball comedy w/ Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert\n\nMake Way for Tomorrow (Leo McCarey, 1935)^\n\n-Sweet, sad, Depression comedic romance about aging, w/ Beulah Bondi, Victor Moore, and Thomas Mitchell\n\nSwing Time (George Stevens, 1936)\n\n-Light New York musical w/ Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (Michael Curtiz, 1938)*\n\n-Swashbuckling adventure w/ Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Claude Rains, and Basil Rathbone\n\nGone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939)*\n\n-Iconic Civil War epic w/ Vivian Leigh, Clark Gable, Thomas Mitchell, & Hattie McDaniel\n\nYoung Mr. Lincoln (John Ford, 1939)*\n\n-Unconventional, slow-moving biopic w/ Henry Fonda\n\n1940s:\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (John Ford, 1940)\n\n-Realist Depression adaptation of the novel w/ Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, & John Carradine\n\nThe Shop Around the Corner (Ernst Lubitsch, 1940)\n\n-Light, evocative romantic comedy w/ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, & Frank Morgan\n\nHis Girl Friday (Howard Hawks, 1940)\n\n-Fast-paced screwball comedy (contrast w/ above) w/ Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell\n\nSullivan's Travels (Preston Sturges, 1941)\n\n-Serious, satirical comedy w/ Joel McCrea & Veronica Lake\n\nCasablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942)\n\n-Hollywood-style war romance w/ Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, & Peter Lorre\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (Vincente Minnelli, 1944)*\n\n-Musical heralding onset of post-war darkness w/ Judy Garland & Margaret O'Brien\n\nDouble Indemnity (Billy Wilder, 1944)\n\n-Quintessential, sharp noir w/ Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, & Edward G.

(Gordon Douglas, 1954)^\n\n-Atomic age anxieties fought by science w/ James Whitmore & giant ants\n\nIt's Always Fair Weather (Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1955)\n\n-Unconventionally bitter musical seeped in the 50s w/ Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey, & Cyd Charisse\n\nAll That Heaven Allows (Douglas Sirk, 1955)\n\n-Adult melodrama of alienation w/ Jane Wyman & Rock Hudson\n\nRebel Without a Cause (Nicholas Ray, 1955)\n\n-Teen melodrama of alienation w/ James Dean, Natalie Wood, & Sal Mineo\n\nAround the World in 80 Days (Michael Todd, 1956)*\n\n-Lengthy, cameo-filled widescreen epic w/ David Niven & Cantinflas\n\nThe Searchers (John Ford, 1956)*\n\n-Racism-themed Western shows shift in use of stars w/ John Wayne & Jeffrey Hunter\n\nRio Bravo (Howard Hawks, 1959)*\n\n-Methodical, hang-out Western w/ John Wayne, Dean Martin, & Ricky Nelson\n\nNorth by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, 1959)\n\n-Slick thriller of the ad-man age w/ Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, & James Mason\n\nAnatomy of a Murder (Otto Preminger, 1959)\n\n-Solid, deliberate courtroom drama w/ James Stewart, Lee Remick, & Ben Gazzara\n\nI'm going to throw the 60s in there too, since it's the last decade of the studio system. And because Stoo's comment makes it seem necessary. This decade in particular can't be understood without the British inclusions; read which films seem to be missing as telling in itself.\n\n1960s:\n\nThe Apartment (Billy Wilder, 1960)\n\n-Sad romantic comedy about NYC offices w/ Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacClaine, & Fred MacMurray\n\nPsycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960)\n\n-The television aesthetic & non-mystical, non-atomic horror ascend w/ Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962)*\n\n-Elegaic Western shoots holes in myth w/ James Stewart & John Wayne\n\nThe Nutty Professor (Jerry Lewis, 1963)\n\n-Comedy auteur skewers Rat Pack & college culture w/ Jerry Lewis\n\nDr. Strangelove: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964)\n\n-Cold War black comedy w/ Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Mike Nichols, 1966)\n\n-Explicit language and adult themes in documentary-style drama w/ Elizabeth Taylor & Richard Burton\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner (Stanley Kramer, 1967)\n\n-Socially conscious drama on race is last pairing w/ Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, & Sidney Poitier\n\nCasino Royale (Ken Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish, & Val Guest, 1967)\n\n-The logical conclusion of film excess & a distillation of all 60s pop culture w/ David Niven, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress, & Woody Allen\n\nBonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967)*\n\n-American New Wave crime film of youthful rebellion w/ Faye Dunaway & Warren Beatty\n\nThe Wild Bunch (Sam Peckinpah, 1969)*\n\n-Violent, men-on-a-mission Western finishes what Liberty Valance started w/ William Holden, Ernest Borgnine & Robert Ryan\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nBringing Up Baby (1938) is another fine '30s screwball comedy, starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant.\n\nSuch a large baby too.\n\nSince Stoo and Herr Knight forced me to embark on yet another viewing of Casablanca, I've been on something of a Bogart run, his War Era pictures in particular.\n\nWhile not one of Bogart's finest outings, Sahara ranks as a personal favorite.\n\nThe below clip is from around the middle third of the flick. I was looking for a trailer, but couldn't seem to find one. It doesn't really give anything away in my opinion, but it does detail the movies core conflict -- ideology versus survival. It'll probably remind certain individuals of The Lost Patrol.\n\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rzjyW40XEEs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPassage to Marseille is another favorite. It's something of an unofficial sequel to Casablanca since almost all of the same cast is back again, but the story goes in a completely direction. Peter Lorre is an exceptional standout in this one. If for nothing else, check it out for its use of practical SFX.\n\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2_c20fCNMuY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAnd on an unrelated note, do make a point to see the ravishing Gene Tierney in The Shanghai Gesture. The things Josef von Sternberg gets away with under the Haye's Code is phenomenal. The concentric circles of Hell that are Mother Gin Sling's gaming establishment are equally great.\n\nLe Saboteur said:\n\nSince Stoo and Herr Knight forced me to embark on yet another viewing of Casablanca, I've been on something of a Bogart run, his War Era pictures in particular.\n\nWhile not one of Bogart's finest outings, Sahara ranks as a personal favorite.\n\nThe below clip is from around the middle third of the flick.

Eventually, I came across a magazine ad for Video Search Service, to whom I wrote a letter with requests and they were able to find & mail it to me! Good stuff and an early John Ford classic. Much closer to \"Lost Patrol\" is the WW2 flick, \"Bataan\", because the story & ending is almost identical.\n\nLe Saboteur said:\n\nPassage to Marseille is another favorite. It's something of an unofficial sequel to Casablanca since almost all of the same cast is back again, but the story goes in a completely direction. Peter Lorre is an exceptional standout in this one. If for nothing else, check it out for its use of practical SFX.\n\nCoincidentally, I happened to watch \"Passage to Marseille\" a few months ago after not seeing it in many, many years. It used to be one of my Bogie faves but not anymore. Claude Rains is great (as always) but it's like a propaganda film for France. The dialogue is too patriotic and flag-waving for my tastes now. However, it IS a well-made movie and intriguing because it shows a flashback within a flashback within a flashback within the main story frame. That's 4 levels of timeframe which go backwards and then forwards, which is cool.\n\nAnother good WW2-era Bogie flick is, \"To Have and Have Not\".\n\nFound and watched this last weekend:\n\nIt's the 1939 remake of a 1927 silent film, which was an adaptation of the 1922 Broadway play.\n\nFrom the back of the DVD cover:\n\nBob Hope built a career out of the persona of the fussy, fast-talking lothario spooked by sex, the blowhard who crumbles at the first sight of trouble, in The Cat and The Canary Hope gave this character its first outing and never looked back, the film to this day is still one of the best horror spoofs ever made.\n\nTen years have passed since the death of millionaire Cyrus Norman, his attorney gathers his six remaining relatives in his old mansion in the swamps of Louisiana to read the will. The family maid appears and announces that the spirits have told her that one of them will die that night and Hendrick, the local prison [actually asylum] guard warns them that 'The Cat' a homicidal maniac has escaped and could appear at any minute. This sets up a night filled with murders, mysteries and intrigue. Hope has one great one-liner after another in this old dark house mystery-comedy.\n\nI liked this film a lot. Right from the start as the attorney is being paddled through the bayou to the creepy old house, and then deserted by the boatman.\n\nSecret passageways, hidden treasure, plenty of atmosphere, an indication of the supernatural, and a sense of foreboding and isolation reminiscent of the zombie movies of the '30s and '40s, yet with humour running through it by way of Hope's character.\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nFound and watched this last weekend:\n\nIt's the 1939 remake of a 1927 silent film, which was an adaptation of the 1922 Broadway play.\n\nFrom the back of the DVD cover:\n\nI liked this film a lot.

Creepy yet funny whilst being atmospheric too. I never get tired of watching this. George Zucco (the attorney) seemed to make a career of being creepy.\n\nWhat a Carve Up was a film in a similar vein and was no doubt inspired by Cat and the Canary, that was made in 1960 or 61 though but has all the credentials of the old dark house movies of the 30's and 40's. In that one Sid James and Kenneth Connor provide the comic relief.\n\nThere were also 2 Basil Rathbone old dark house films that are good in this genre too, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death and Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear, both feature people within the house being murdered one by one. Well worth checking out.\n\nAndyLGR said:\n\nI watched this last week, and have seen it many times, I have it in a double DVD set with another Bob Hope film called Ghost Breakers.\n\nBut this version of The Cat and the Canary is IMO the best of the old dark house murder mystery films.

I've found they're available on YouTube:\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/hyf0_0DV_4Y?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2bsCJZ6el-A?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI'm downloading them now."
