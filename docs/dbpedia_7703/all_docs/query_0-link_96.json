        "meta_description": "Apr 5, 2021 - Los Angeles-born Leo McCarey was, along with Frank Capra, one of the most popular and successful comedy directors of the pre-World War II era. A triple-threat as writer and producer as well as director, McCarey made some of the most inspired comedies of the 1930’s. \n“I don’t know what my formula is. I only know I like my characters to walk in clouds. I like a little bit of the fairy tale. Let others photograph the ugliness of the world. I don’t want to distress people.” ~ Leo McCarey.
