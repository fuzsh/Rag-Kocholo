        "text": "Director / Producer / Screenwriter\n\n(1896-1969) Born October 3, Los Angeles, California, USATop 250 Directors\n\nKey Production Country: USA\n\nKey Genres: Comedy, Drama, Romance, Melodrama, Slapstick, Short Film, Screwball Comedy, Romantic Drama, Romantic Comedy, Religious Drama, Farce, Comedy DramaKey Collaborators: Robert Emmett Dolan (Composer), Hans Dreier (Production Designer), Cary Grant (Leading Actor), George Barnes (Cinematographer), Leroy Stone (Editor), William Flannery (Production Designer), Harry Bernard (Character Actor), Stan Laurel (Leading Actor), Bing Crosby (Leading Actor), Irene Dunne (Leading Actress), Oliver Hardy (Leading Actor), Vina Delmar (Screenwriter)\n\n\"Leo McCarey's supervision of 1930s and 40s Hollywood comedies is more akin to contract studio authorship than independent auteurism... After holding various jobs in the film industry, McCarey began writing gags and directing Charlie Chase two-reelers at the Hal Roach studio in 1923... In 1929 McCarey graduated to features and hit his stride. With a winning combination of zany humour and popular sentiment, he directed some of the era's biggest star vehicles.\" - Richard Armstrong (The Rough Guide to Film, 2007)\n\n\"Leo McCarey has always presented auteur criticism with one of its greatest challenges and one that has never been convincingly met... He worked consistently (and apparently quite uncomplainingly) within the dominant codes of shooting and editing that comprise the anonymous \"classical Hollywood\" style... Yet his name is on some of the best - and best-loved - Hollywood films (as well as on some that embarrass many of even his most fervent defenders).\" - Robin Wood (The St. James Film Directors Encyclopedia, 1998)\n\n\"Blending an explosive sense of humor with unabashed sentimentality, McCarey came up with such comedy gems as Ruggles of Red Gap and The Awful Truth and such maudlin pearls as Make Way for Tomorrow and Going My Way.\" - The MacMillan International Film Encyclopedia, 1994\n\n\"Leo McCarey represents a principle of improvisation in the history of the American film. Noted less for his rigorous direction than for his relaxed digressions, McCarey has distilled a unique blend of farce and sentimentality in his best efforts... McCarey's moments may outlive his movies... After enough great moments are assembled, however, a personal style must be assumed even though it is difficult to describe.\" - Andrew Sarris (The American Cinema, 1968)\n\n\"More than just a gag man, McCarey developed a fine storytelling sense. He also had a flair for sentimental stories, as proved by the wrenching portrait of old age, Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), the touching romance Love Affair (1939), and Going My Way (1944, for which he won his second Best Director Oscar, and snagged another for his screenplay).\" - Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia, 1995\n\n\"Jean Renoir once said that McCarey understood people better than anyone else in Hollywood. That facility enabled him to create warm, witty, sometimes zany comedies and gentle dramas.\" - William R. Meyer (The Film Buff's Catalog, 1978)"
