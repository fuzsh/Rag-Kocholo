The following year he signed with Fox (later Twentieth Century-Fox) and then made Wild Company (1930), an account of a spoiled youth (played by Frank Albertson) who is framed for murder; the drama is memorable for featuring Bela Lugosi, who portrayed a nightclub owner. McCarey next directed the popular musical Let’s Go Native (1930), which starred Jeanette MacDonald, Kay Francis, and Jack Oakie as people shipwrecked on a tropical island. He had even more success with Part Time Wife (1930), a comedy about an estranged couple (Edmund Lowe and Leila Hyams) who reconnect through golf. It was cowritten by McCarey, who contributed to the story or screenplay for most of his films. Next came Indiscreet (1931), a largely forgettable musical despite the presence of Gloria Swanson. The Kid from Spain (1932) was better, a lavish Eddie Cantor vehicle with songs, slapstick, and Busby Berkeley’s inventive dance sequences.\n\nIn 1933 McCarey signed with Paramount Pictures. There he worked with some of the most-renowned names in film comedy and honed his own freewheeling comic style, based on improvisational techniques learned during his days with Laurel and Hardy. His first effort for the studio was Duck Soup (1933), starring the Marx Brothers. Although a flop when released, it is now regarded as one of the greatest comedies of all time. McCarey also worked with W.C. Fields, George Burns, and Gracie Allen on Six of a Kind (1934) and with Mae West on Belle of the Nineties (1934), which was West’s final film before her screen image was tamed by the onset of the Production Code.\n\nIt was not until Ruggles of Red Gap (1935), however, that McCarey directed a film bearing many of his trademarks: a comic sense that blended reality and farce, a glorification of the American character concurrent with a condemnation of American materialism and naïveté, a reflection of McCarey’s own Roman Catholic values, and a warm sentimentality that usually transcended cloying sweetness. The comedy featured Charles Laughton as a butler who, while in Paris with his aristocratic employer, is won in a poker game by an American rancher (Charlie Ruggles) and his pretentious wife (Mary Boland) and is taken to their home in the West.\n\nThe Milky Way (1936) was arguably Harold Lloyd’s best sound picture, a fanciful tale of a meek milkman who ends up fighting for the middleweight boxing championship.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nMcCarey’s most personal film, Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), was a bittersweet indictment of the mistreatment of the elderly. It was a radical departure for the director, an unabashed tearjerker about an impoverished elderly couple (Beulah Bondi and Victor Moore) whose selfish children are not willing to house both of them, so they must live apart. McCarey showed a hitherto unrevealed facility for dramatizing serious emotion, which he would call on more frequently in the future.\n\nMcCarey then moved to Columbia Pictures, where he directed the classic Cary Grant–Irene Dunne screwball comedy The Awful Truth (1937). It centres on a bickering couple who separate after believing the other is unfaithful but eventually realize they still love each other. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including a nod for best picture, but only McCarey won an Oscar, for his stylish freewheeling direction. In accepting the award, he thanked the academy but said, “You’ve given me this for the wrong film.” The comment was a reference to Make Way for Tomorrow, which remained McCarey’s favourite among his works.\n\nMiddle years\n\nAfter signing with RKO, McCarey made the ultraromantic Love Affair (1939), in which Charles Boyer and Dunne portrayed strangers who fall in love during a cruise and plan to meet again in six months, only to have their reunion disrupted when Dunne is struck by a car, crippling her. McCarey worked on the script with his writers even as shooting was progressing, and the result is a classic tearjerker. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including for best picture, and McCarey received a nod for his work on the story. (He would remake the picture 18 years later as An Affair to Remember.) McCarey also cowrote the story for My Favorite Wife (1940), with Grant and Dunne. He was slated to direct it, but a near-fatal car crash forced him to hand the reins over to Garson Kanin, who turned it into a comic classic and one of 1940’s highest-grossing films.\n\nLess successful was Once Upon a Honeymoon (1942), a witless comedy-drama-romance. It starred Grant as a radio reporter who has to save a chorus girl (Ginger Rogers) from her Nazi husband (Walter Slezak) as the newlyweds honeymoon across war-torn Europe. A misfire for McCarey, it drew particular criticism for its almost lighthearted treatment of Nazism.\n\nMcCarey’s tenure at RKO ended, but Paramount was happy to obtain his services, particularly after his first film for the studio, Going My Way (1944), was a success. The shamelessly sentimental yarn—from McCarey’s own story—centres on Father Chuck O’Malley (Bing Crosby), a priest whose unorthodox methods initially earn the ire of a superior (Barry Fitzgerald). Going My Way was the biggest hit of 1944, and it nearly swept the Academy Awards, winning for best picture, director, actor (Crosby), supporting actor (Fitzgerald), story (McCarey), screenplay, and song (“Swinging on a Star”). McCarey had similar success with The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), in which Crosby returned as O’Malley, who is now at loggerheads with the mother superior (Ingrid Bergman) of a Catholic school. It earned eight Oscar nominations, with McCarey receiving a nod for his direction, and was the top-grossing film of 1945. Some observed that, in lesser hands, those two films would be unbearably saccharine. McCarey, however, skillfully balanced potentially maudlin moments with music and moments of low comedy, and he filmed scenes of sweetness and generosity with a calm simple detachment devoid of manipulative tricks.\n\nLast films\n\nMcCarey’s films that followed World War II bear a slightly cynical tone previously unseen in his work. Personal problems limited his output to five films during the rest of his career. Three years elapsed before Good Sam (1948), a feeble comedy in which Gary Cooper played a compulsive doer of good deeds, a trait that upsets his long-suffering wife (Ann Sheridan). Another extended period of inactivity followed, ending with My Son John (1952), a fervent anticommunist tract with Robert Walker as a seditious young man whose mother (Helen Hayes) tries desperately to save him.\n\nHis powers were clearly on the wane, but McCarey pulled himself together for An Affair to Remember (1957), a remake of Love Affair that is better-remembered than its predecessor, though some would argue that it is not as good. Grant and Deborah Kerr starred, and McCarey cowrote the lyrics to the Oscar-nominated title tune. Rally ’Round the Flag, Boys! (1958), starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, and Joan Collins, was McCarey’s first comedy in 10 years. It had scattered moments of proficiency, but it failed to capture the madcap humour of Max Shulman’s best-selling book. McCarey’s final film, Satan Never Sleeps (1962), was another anticommunist story, about two intractable priests (William Holden and Clifton Webb) in China who refuse to give ground to the local communists. It was a weak ending to the career of a once great talent.\n\nMichael Barson The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
