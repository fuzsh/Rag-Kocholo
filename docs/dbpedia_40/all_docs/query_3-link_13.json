        "text": "Peace has enjoyed its Partnership with Berkley Schools. The high quality educators they have provided us have allowed us to enrich our curriculum much more than what we would have been able to do on our own. They are easy to work with and have made our partnership extremely successful.\n\n-Michael Nelson, Principal, Peace Lutheran School\n\nSt. Anselm Catholic School has been a Shared Time partner of Berkley School District for 10 years. When I first met the team at Berkley, I was impressed with their offerings and their organization. As time has gone on, staff has changed but their level of professionalism has not. The offerings continue to work well with our school environment and schedule, and our teachers are dedicated and kind. We, at St. Anselm, feel close to the staff and feel like we can reach out to them anytime with any concern. We look forward to many more years in partnership with Berkley Schools!\n\n-Angela Kraetke, Principal, St. Anselm Catholic School"
