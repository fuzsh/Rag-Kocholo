        "text": "For French theatre history, the seventeenth century paradoxically stands out as both the Grand Siècle, or golden age, in which Pierre Corneille, Molière, and Jean Racine produced their masterpieces, and as a period of intense antitheatrical sentiment in which Jansenist theologians like Pierre Nicole and Catholic bishops like Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet composed treatises against the stage and its players. French historiographers have given the name la querelle de la moralité du théâtre, or the quarrel over the theatre's morality, to the diverse episodes that called into question the theatre's place in public life in prerevolutionary France.Footnote 1 This quarrel merits a performance analysis. Whereas theatre scholarship has devoted careful attention to the material features of early modern theatre practice, antitheatrical sentiment's story has largely been told as a progression of ideas.Footnote 2 In works that remain essential reading, scholars such as Moses Barras, Marc Fumaroli, Jonas Barish, Simone de Reyff, Jean Dubu, Sylviane Léoni, and Laurent Thirouin have examined the rise and development of French arguments against the stage, reconstructing French antitheatrical sentiment's intellectual history from antiquity through the French Revolution.Footnote 3 As demonstrated by titles such as Dubu's Les Églises chrétiennes et le théâtre [Christian churches and the theatre] and de Reyff's L’Église et le théâtre [the church and the theatre], enough of the period's antitheatrical fervor had religious roots that French theatre polemics are often also conceptualized as a conflict between the church and the theatre.\n\nSurprisingly, though, little scholarly attention has focused on the human interactions and embodied activities that facilitated the spread of antitheatrical ideas among priests. Histories of French polemics about the stage can therefore give the impression that actors had bodies whereas priests did not, creating a mind–body split in scholarship on antitheatrical sentiment by associating the theatre with materiality and the church with ideas. Alongside its use of writing, however, the Catholic Church used what theatre scholars could consider a performance repertoire to help transmit theological ideas, doctrinal propositions, religious values, and moral arguments to the laity. This repertoire consisted of the gestures, ceremonies, and sacraments that made up the liturgy, along with the modes of bodily comportment that helped churchmen forge their priestly identity at the altar and in daily interactions with parishioners.Footnote 4\n\nKnowledge about priestly repertoires matters for theatre history because priests at the parish level gave antitheatrical sentiment its teeth, transforming ideas about the theatre's moral harm into material consequences for actors. They did this by excluding actors from the sacraments. In a Catholic kingdom where sacramental participation and civic life were practically synonymous, exclusion had grave consequences for a person's well-being and reputation.Footnote 5 The nature of the sacramental exclusion imposed on actors varied from diocese to diocese but resulted in the marginalization of actors regardless of the exclusion's specific form. In some places, actors could not receive Communion or marry. In others, they were refused the last rites and Christian burial. In many places, they could not serve as godparents. Only by renouncing their profession could actors obtain absolution and restore themselves to sacramental participation. Priestly repertoires, in other words, played a crucial role in antitheatrical sentiment's history.\n\nTo reconstruct the early modern Catholic Church's bodily repertoire, especially as priests used it in relation to the theatre and its players, requires a performance analysis of liturgical manuals and other ecclesiastical texts such as episcopal edicts, seminary rules, and priestly correspondence. Chief among such documents is the diocesan Ritual, a type of liturgical book issued by the local bishop that gave instructions for conducting all the sacraments except the Eucharist.Footnote 6 In the same way that a Missal details what priests are supposed to say and do while celebrating Mass, a Ritual contains instructions for the other six Catholic sacraments.Footnote 7 When a bishop wanted the priests in his diocese to exclude actors from the sacraments, he made this clear by listing actors in the diocesan Ritual as “public sinners,” thereby disqualifying them from the sacraments until they publicly renounced their actions.Footnote 8 As Dubu has shown in his study of 127 diocesan Rituals published in France between 1600 and 1713, 30 percent of the Rituals published after 1649 excluded actors from the sacraments, whereas only 10 percent had classified actors as public sinners during the first half of the century.Footnote 9 An analysis of the diocesan Ritual's use in seminary training and parish practice between approximately 1640 and 1740 therefore offers one way to gain a more nuanced understanding of how attitudes against actors spread among French churchmen at the parish level.\n\nAlthough diocesan Rituals provide a documentary link between antitheatrical sentiment and concrete actions taken against stage players, or between ideas and materiality, many questions remain about how to interpret the evidence they provide. Given the bishop's responsibility for issuing a Ritual, a top-down hypothesis about the relationship between antitheatrical sentiment and the sacramental exclusion of actors implicitly informs scholarship on the theatre conflict. Dubu's approach, focused on the bishops who issued Rituals rather than the clerical teams who often composed them or the priests who used them, exemplifies this tendency. Stated explicitly, a top-down hypothesis would propose that antitheatrical ideas from treatises associated with the querelle de la moralité du théâtre inspired French bishops to list actors as public sinners, which in turn prompted parish priests to withhold sacraments from actors. This top-down version of events may certainly describe the transmission of antitheatrical ideas in some cases, especially after the 1660s. At least two important difficulties nonetheless challenge a top-down transmission hypothesis, namely, chronology and consistency.\n\nFrom a chronological perspective, the first Ritual to list comédiens (professional actors) as public sinners poses a puzzle.Footnote 10 Published in 1649, it predates by at least a decade the century's major French antitheatrical treatises by Armand de Bourbon, prince de Conti (1666), Nicole (1667), the abbé Joseph de Voisin (1671), and Bossuet (1694). Its location also raises questions. Whereas one would expect to find the first antiactor Ritual in Paris, the hotbed of theatre debates, the first Ritual to specify that comédiens should not receive the sacraments was instead issued by Félix Vialart de Herse, the bishop of Châlons, where the sparse archival traces of theatre professionals make it unlikely that parish priests had many encounters with actors. What prompted the bishop of Châlons to add comédiens to the list of public sinners at midcentury?\n\nCertainly, a growing tide of sentiment against the theatre during the first half of the seventeenth century provides important context. By 1649, English antitheatrical sentiment had already given rise to William Prynne's Histrio-Mastix (1633) and to the suppression of public theatres in England in 1642.Footnote 11 Debates about the theatre were intensifying in France, too. A protestant pastor named André Rivet published a pamphlet against plays in 1639, in response to which Georges de Scudéry published a defense of the theatre the same year. Between 1643 and 1646, Corneille's martyr plays, Polyeucte and Théodore, incited discussion about the theatre's capacity to represent sacred subjects. Most important, in 1641, at the behest of his chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII issued a royal edict in favor of actors. It declared that as long as their acting did not contain representations that could harm the public, such as “dishonest actions” or “lascivious words or words with double meanings,” actors were not to be held guilty for their profession.Footnote 12 As Henry Phillips and Déborah Blocker suggest, French bishops who listed actors as public sinners in the wake of Louis XIII's 1641 edict may have done so to counteract the king's effort to protect stage players from the condition of infamy inherited from Roman law.Footnote 13 Nonetheless, neither the edict of 1641 nor the still-developing circulation of treatises for and against the theatre explains why one bishop rather than another would list actors as public sinners at midcentury. The history of ideas does not fully elucidate the material facts.\n\nThe second challenge to a top-down hypothesis about the transmission of antitheatrical ideas among parish-level clergy has to do with the lack of consistency with which priests excluded actors from the sacraments. In Gaston Maugras's words, “everything is inconsistent” in the history of the French church's refusal to administer sacraments to actors.Footnote 14 To begin with, as studies of the early modern French theatre unanimously attest, not all bishops listed actors as public sinners. Although the number of diocesan Rituals to exclude actors from the sacraments increased sharply during the second half of the seventeenth century, most bishops chose not to exclude actors from the sacraments. The 30 percent of antiactor Rituals identified by Dubu represent an important share of French diocesan Rituals, but far from the majority, which either suggests that antitheatrical tracts had limited influence in episcopal circles or that other factors, beyond the theological arguments advanced by figures such as Nicole and Bossuet, helped determine whether a diocese adopted measures against actors.\n\nTo make an inconsistent situation still more unpredictable, not all priests refused sacraments to actors, even in those dioceses with an antiactor Ritual. French clergy did not, for example, refuse sacraments to Italian actors, even though diocesan Rituals did not specify that an actor's nationality had any bearing on their status as public sinners.Footnote 15 Nor did churchmen consider singers, dancers, and opera performers comédiens, which consequently spared them from sacramental exclusion.Footnote 16 Even within a single parish, variability occurred. Parish registers suggest that priests sometimes allowed actors to list an alternative profession so they could participate in the sacraments, especially for baptisms. Molière, for example, used his titles as “Valet de chambre tapissier du Roi” and “Écuyer” in parish registers that list him as the godfather at baptisms for his nephew in 1659 and for the children of fellow actors Du Parc in 1663 and La Grange in 1672, as well as baptisms in 1661 and 1663.Footnote 17 At least two of these baptisms were conducted in the Parish of Saint-Eustache, whose clergymen would later refuse to give Molière a Christian burial. The parish's priests thus knew Molière's profession as an actor when he served as godfather and chose to overlook it. Actors who lacked titles as illustrious as those possessed by Molière listed themselves as “bourgeois de Paris,” again suggesting that priests occasionally allowed for loopholes when it came to sacramental exclusion.\n\nA further element of inconsistency arises in relation to the clergymen who penned antitheatrical treatises. They were not the same priests who withheld sacraments from actors, creating yet another breach between the history of antitheatrical ideas and their implementation at the parish level. Bossuet provides the best example. Although in 1694 he authored a refutation of the stage, Bossuet never issued a diocesan Ritual in his capacity as bishop.Footnote 18 Conversely, the priests whose names have entered the historical record for withholding sacraments from actors did not compose treatises against the theatre. Nor did they, in general, belong to the highest ranks of the church. The three priests who refused to come to Molière's bedside—Fathers Lenfant, Lechat, and Paysant—were prêtres habitués, a type of priest that Annik Pardailhé-Galabrun calls “the true plebs of the clergy.”Footnote 19 Such priests lived together in a parish without any kind of benefice and supported the curate and vicar by conducting smaller religious services, such as masses for the dead and vespers, the revenues from which they shared in common.Footnote 20 As the century progressed, the likelihood that such priests had some kind of formal ecclesiastical training increased but, particularly during the first half of the seventeenth century, the average level of education for French diocesan clergymen was low, a trend that only gradually began to change after the 1640s with the foundation of France's first seminaries.Footnote 21 Even in the Parisian parish of Saint-Sulpice, where most known cases in which a priest refused sacraments to an actor occurred, and where the priests had a greater level of education thanks to their close connection to the parish's seminary, the clergymen who withheld sacraments from actors did not contribute any of their own pamphlets to the century's theatre debates.Footnote 22 To understand why some priests refused sacraments to some actors under some conditions therefore requires attention to the diversity of the early modern priesthood, the process of ecclesiastical professionalization over the course of the seventeenth century, and the particularities of a sacramental encounter that might make it more or less difficult for a priest to exert his authority in relation to an actor.\n\nIn other words, the story of antitheatrical sentiment needs its own performance history. The diocesan Ritual offers a starting point for a performance account of antitheatrical sentiment because it was not merely a prescriptive text that facilitated top-down reforms; it also functioned as a ceremonial object. When we focus on the ceremonial function of the diocesan Ritual and its relation to priestly performance rather than on its status as a prescriptive text, a different story of French antitheatrical activity emerges. A performance analysis reveals that the Ritual's physical presence during liturgical rites authorized a limited but nonetheless significant degree of ceremonial innovation on the part of clergymen who found themselves in situations for which the diocesan Ritual's content did not offer explicit instructions. This margin for innovation had important consequences for stage players—especially during the 1640s, when Catholic reform gained momentum in France and diocesan Rituals did not yet include instructions for how to deal with new cultural figures, such as the professional actor, who were gaining visibility and political legitimacy. Rather than trickling down from regulatory texts imposed by the church's elite, the diocesan Ritual's ceremonial status suggests that the idea of excluding actors from the sacraments emerged first among France's parish clergy in places where clergymen who did not belong to religious orders—known as secular priests—were struggling to professionalize by improving their ceremonial skills. Seminaries proved just such places. In them, ecclesiastical action against actors began as ceremonial experiments, captured the attention of France's higher clergy, and thereafter passed into normative documents like the diocesan Ritual, reinforcing antitheatrical discourses by enabling the theatre's opponents to cite the church's liturgical handbooks in their arguments against the stage."
