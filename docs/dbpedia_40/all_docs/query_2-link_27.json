        "text": "Well, if we only learned one thing from Ben Boycott’s first (seemingly of two) statement, at least we know who is in charge. Blessedly, there was much more to digest and learn than who makes the decisions but the unequivocal nature of the way Boycott spelled his intentions out let everyone know that he’s now in sole charge at the Football Club.\n\nThe circus has a new ringmaster folks and the clowns risk being fed to the lions.\n\nIn terms of content, Boycott gave plenty of indications of what is to come. Whether you take the sections around strategy and future plans at face value or wait to see the proof of the pudding is a choice we all have but openly publishing the basis of a vision feels pretty much like a decent step forward for this club. There are things missing that aren’t directly linked to the playing side of the club such as the sharp price increases, site development, commercial strategy and board structure but hopefully some of these will be referenced in part two of Ben’s communication.\n\nRefreshingly there was also plenty of reflection, honesty, acknowledgment of past failure and ownership of issues. Being fair, Leigh Pomlett was always open and transparent with his summation of events and looked to communicate regularly, but much of what Boycott published was/is new ground. Even as a summary, the statement contained more detail than I can previously recall.\n\nI also felt that the more opinionated and inherently personal parts of the letter added flavour and a transparency to the information provided. And the opinions included were often really telling.\n\n“It starts with me personally looking in the mirror, asking what has been going on at the club, asking what mistakes I myself have made and what mistakes the club has made, and asking how it is going to be different going forward.” is arguably the most self-critical sentence to come out of the football club in decades.\n\n“Blaming poor luck, however, is cheap and weak. The poor luck turned into a losing habit, which was allowed to snowball into the demise of a once-promising season.” is another brutally straightforward comment that I don’t feel would have seen the light of a club statement pre-Pomlett.\n\nSimilarly, “We need to understand why and make strategic changes as we make this critical next decision” is as fundamentally transparent as an acceptance of systemic failure and the need to change gets.\n\nBoycott’s public admission of inner searching, his willingness to be seen being vulnerable and what was essentially a recognition of a season failure is so far removed from the past it’s almost difficult to comprehend. The suggestion that if you don’t like it, then do one to Luton or Bournemouth or Rotherham doesn’t really feel like it’s from a different era, because it feels more like from a different galaxy. If there was any doubt that this is a different time, then the personal aspects and opinions within this letter spell it out as clear as it’s possible to do so. Evidently, Boycott understands that trust and respect is hard earned and easily lost.\n\nWhat also feels like something entirely fresh is the open publication of a strategy. For too long this football club has given the manager the keys to the first team and hoped they could drive. Dean Smith was the last appointment that could be considered successful and that was more than thirteen years ago. The new appointment will be our eighth attempt at trying to find a manager who can take us forward since Smith failed to finish the job he’d started.\n\nBoycott’s reference to not taking the easy way out by laying the sole blame at the manager’s door is the first of many welcome indicators around this issue. It is abundantly clear from the seven managerial casualties since December 2015 and the continued lack of progress on the pitch that the issues that have stopped the football club achieving the results and league position it is capable of run far deeper than the choice of manager(s). In appointing men that are League 2 course and distance proven, the local lad, the known quantity, the internal promotion or the experienced pro with experience of developing young players it could be argued we’ve tried sailing every type of managerial ship in order to find calmer waters. All have been found with their vessels listing amongst the rocks.\n\nOn the day Michael Flynn was appointed I tweeted that should he fail, we could be sure that the issue wasn’t the manager and I stand by that. The fact that Swindon acted so decisively once Flynn became available should also be telling. By their actions, they’ve completely discounted Flynn’s record here, just as Burslem Carol chose to do with Clarke. Both Vale and Swindon appear to have overlooked the lack of progress that their identified men made here, which arguably suggests that they felt it was the club rather than the manager that was the issue. I sense that Boycott has also recognised this. His reference to eight managers in eight years and the need for strategic changes suggest that after 12 months of listening and learning he has identified what he thinks are the issues.\n\nAlbert Einstein famously said that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” This is mirrored in Boycott’s reference to identifying “the singular individual who is the right fit for that moment, and empower them to implement their process, their style of play, their staff, and their playing squad to get the formula just right. When that hasn’t worked in one situation or another, we’ve terminated the manager, hired a new one, and gone again.”\n\nBoycott and his partners are no fools, their investment in a football club with little assets and competing on a different continent suggests plenty of ambition and a strong competitive streak to untap the potential they believes that they have identified. There would have been plenty of softer challenges much closer to home. Some will rightly question why Walsall and what is the pay back, and in truth that hasn’t really been fully answered but the only way Boycott and Trivela get a worthwhile payback on their investment is to improve us and move us forward. That will involve taking a lot of tough decisions and getting most of them right. Evolution or revolution? Both involve risk.\n\nAnd so to the Trivela vision, the meat and potatoes of this communication.\n\n“We’ll be working with a fresh plan and a fresh vision from here on. I believe in building a structure, a system, and a culture where a manager can come in if (and only if) they fit that strategy, and be a part of our building process.“\n\nThere are things in here that Boycott doesn’t say that are probably as important as the things he does. Despite the record of 1 win in 21 and absolute loss of any recognisable playing style the parting of ways with Flynn and Hatswell wasn’t universally expected. Continuity and particularly getting to that 3rd transfer window felt important and worth the patience to many. It’s worth noting that Flynn’s much heralded and welcomed arrival did come at the cost of a Director of Football. Jamie Fullarton might not have been the right appointment but it that doesn’t mean that the creation of the position was a poor idea, and it seems from Boycott’s letter that this is the intended direction of travel. Whether they gave Flynn the option of working this way or simply decided that he wouldn’t or couldn’t, the structure where the manager is no longer in complete charge of the football club could well have been as much of a breaking point as our desperate run of results since the Leicester cup tie. I really don’t underestimate the power of the (and only if) in the quote above.\n\nSelecting a manager to fit into what the club wants, rather than the club sacrificing parts of itself to fit into what a manager wants to be seems so blatantly obvious to me. As the bookmaker bingo got into full swing and names shortened an anyone who’s used Hilton Park Services in the last few weeks, the club appears to have positively used the time that Mat Sadler has taken the reins, rightly stepping back and reviewing requirements rather than racing towards another poor appointment.\n\nFinally, blessedly, the plan is more significant than the man.\n\nAnd I really do like the plan. Coincidentally, I asked a couple of friends at the last home game (before this letter) to tell me something positive that the football side of this club currently does well. The silence and subsequent shrugging of shoulders was deafening. Have a think yourselves – in terms of the football side of the club, what do we do well? What do you see that others might want to replicate? The list isn’t all that long.\n\nI’ve also long bemoaned the lack of identity that the football club and in particular the first team have, so the reference to a clear playing identity was great to see. It is really important. As was reference for our core values as a club – Service, Discipline, Excellence and Ambition. These, in reality, should be at the heart of any professional sports organisation but saying and doing are fundamentally different processes. Whilst not directly related to what happens on the pitch, what part of the Poundland Bescot Stadium experience has felt like excellence in the past decade? If you can’t get toilets, catering or stadium access right, what chance of you got of building a solid football infrastructure?\n\nThe constant change of manager also increases and empowers the prioritisation of short-term thinking. Of our last five managers, only Darrell Clarke has enjoyed the scope of recruitment across three transfer windows (his fourth window was probably the catalyst for his departure). This has to be part of the root cause of why we have quite so many summer squad overhauls and precisely why the implementation of strategy and recruitment plan driven by a DoF, or the somewhat grandiosely titled Trivela’s VP of Global Football, is key. Someone has to think long term and that is never going be a manager who lives and dies by the final score every Saturday and Tuesday..\n\nThe fact that the intention to build our recruitment structure on analytics and data is interesting. I’d have hoped, and expected, that we already did character and culture fit checks as part of the current recruitment process. It’s from where this blog got its name of course, but there have been squads, groups and individuals, past and present, where you wonder what due diligence was actually done. Recruitment via analytics and data seems very much to be in vogue and you only have to look at Brighton, Brentford and Southampton (over a decade) to see how effectively it can work. That said, in a post Brexit environment it is so much more difficult to recruit non-British players into Leagues 1 & 2 due to work permit requirements. Brighton and Brentford can make it work effectively as they’re recruiting current international footballers from clubs in top-flight football and European competition. However the days of raiding Feirense for Jorge Letaio or Logroñés for Zigor Aranalde are long gone and the restrictions will make recruitment from data much harder and potentially more expensive – the pool of players at our level will be significantly smaller and we’ll all see the same data, right?\n\nIntuition is also referenced and still has a significant role to play – I seriously doubt that you’d have taken any of Kyle Lightbourne, Troy Deeney or Tom Bradshaw on pre-Walsall in-play analytics alone and I suspect that seeing what others don’t is where the real value lies.\n\nThere were a couple of items, indirectly associated to recruitment but not mentioned in Boycott’s message that I genuinely hope are areas given more focus.\n\nScouting being one. On Twitter, I highlighted the 2nd Crewe goal as a goal that should never happen with a strong scouting system. It was basic stuff that we should never have fallen for and made we wonder how thorough our pre-game research had been. It wasn’t the only time I’ve thought this. Similarly, the amount of pre and at half time double substitutions we have made in the past 3 or 4 years is symptomatic of us setting up wrong and being forced to correct in order to stay in the game. It happens too regularly to not be linked. The visit to Barrow in August was probably the most obvious example I’ve seen of a team either not scouting the opposition well or just ignoring the reports. We’d lost that evening before we’d worked out how to set up against them. Maybe the days of sitting in the stands taking notes and compiling dossiers are over, maybe not. But whatever we do in this area appears weak and requires a review to my eyes.\n\nSecondly the January window. I referenced Clarke’s exit earlier and the probable link to the January window. That the last 7 managerial departures have happened after the closure of the January transfer window is, in my opinion, not unconnected. Sure, there have been exceptions – O’Driscoll being an obvious one but even the likes of Brian Dutton, who never got a transfer window, inherited a squad undermined by January departures. I genuinely can’t recall a positive January window, and that includes the infamous 2016 window where we celebrated standing still (shutters rolling down) whilst everyone around us improved their options. The January window hurts us almost every season and until we address this, expect much of the same.\n\nReturning back to what is in the strategy, the paragraph given to player development and academy integration identifies possibly the most critical element that needs to be significantly improved and Boycott was right to identify this. EPPP (the Elite Player Performance Plan) has impacted clubs lower down the pyramid with the system favouring the Cat 1 (usually Premier League) academies and I sense that this has had a chunky impact on us. How we recover and restart the conveyer from a system that is heavily loaded in the favour of those at the top of the pyramid is a task form someone with far greater understanding of the mechanics of youth player development than me. I take heart in the changes and introductions made in recent times and I’m genuinely pleased and relieved that topic was referenced in Boycott’s message. Getting this area right and delivering footballers to the first team is vital to long term growth and stability and I genuinely hope that it’s front and centre on Boycott’s radar.\n\nSimilarly the process once our young talent has broken through needs some serious consideration. The falling away of players like Alfie Bates and Sam Perry, the lack of any real opportunity given to Tom Leak and the preference of signing Danny Cashman over providing Ronan Maher with game opportunity are all somewhat disconcerting. Maybe Leak wouldn’t have been good enough but was Joe Low really that much better? The decline in performance of players such as Bates and Perry once they’d got to 20 games really needs to be understood as it happens all too often. The managerial mis-trust of our own young players also needs to be addressed. Additionally, whoever signed off on Danny Cashman, needs to recognise the impact this had in side-lining Maher’s season. It was such a pointless loan. Again, maybe the manager felt that he wasn’t 100% ready for the handful of minutes that Cashman got but the experience Maher would have gleaned from them would have been really valuable. Its another example of short term thinking overriding long term aims.\n\nIn summary, I’d have welcomed any sense of a plan given what we’ve experienced over recent times but I sense a decent amount of logic, thought and determination to get things right within Boycott’s letter.\n\n“And it’s not just about the next manager or the next player or the next match – it’s about us as the club, and putting one brick on another, over time. The next manager that we hire will be one absolutely critical component of this – but as a part of a thoughtful plan, not as the “be all, end all.” They will be coming into an increasingly well-defined Walsall Football Club, rather than coming in and redefining Walsall Football Club for themselves.“\n\nThere is obviously much to do and what feels like a real appetite at the top of the football club to address issues that either haven’t been seen or overlooked in the desperate scramble to exit League 2 in an upwards direction. That scattergun approach has failed and failed and failed and failed and finally we seem to be learning from our errors. That has to be positive.\n\nBoycott also references the process taking time but doesn’t mention the need for patience. That omission may be in order to not negatively affect season ticket sales but it is a trait that I suspect that we will all have to demonstrate, again. Having a plan is one thing, and it’s a decent starting point. However, rolling it out will take time, courage, an eye for detail, collective belief and a decent chink of patience. League 2 will be a tough division next season, strengthened by both promoted and relegated clubs. There may be no instant fix to the problem we have failed to solve for too long.\n\nI wish him well. We all win if Trivela get this right and whilst this feels like a fairly complex build, every part of it makes sense. Time, patience and holding our nerve will be the key to successful deployment. Rome wasn’t built on one managerial appointment or a solitary transfer window.\n\n(A guide on how to not have a successful football season.)\n\nAt half time last Saturday I called my wife. “I’ll be outside at twenty to five”\n\n“Why? What’s the matter?” came the response.\n\n“That’s enough for me this season” was about all I could offer. And it was. The sooner this lousy season was over, then so much the better.\n\nAnd it has been lousy.\n\nWe should have known what was coming relatively quickly last autumn, if only because the opening 10 games were a microcosm of the season that followed. We lost late at Tranmere after holding our own but were neither capable of carving out an opportunity to score or fit enough to withstand the home team’s late push. We then somehow conspired to lose at home to Doncaster, again unable to score or win a penalty shoot out that we were 2 goals up in. Forest Green gave us an object lesson in what L2 excellence looked like and an injury time equaliser punished us for being unable to put a dreadfully poor Scunthorpe to the sword. We hammered Mansfield out of nowhere. never turned up in Hartlepool and left Newport emptyhanded after failing to deal with a late set piece. And repeat, and repeat, and repeat.\n\nMy good friend and co-NNP writer @hallymk1 challenged me recently on whether this indeed was a missed opportunity of a season? Or could it only be judged as a missed opportunity if we’d had enough about us to challenge in the first place? Which he felt we hadn’t, and it’s a fair point. However, I can’t escape the feeling that the porosity of quality in League 2 this season provided a bona-fide opportunity for anyone capable of mixing a sprinkling of quality with a dose of consistency, organisation and fitness. Traits of which we fell well short of on all counts.\n\nIn both those opening ten games and the season that followed the running theme of our woes was a lack of goal threat. In 53 games this season, we failed to score more than once in 42 of them. Oldham & Colchester being the only teams we managed to score 2 or more against both home & away. The loss of Rory Holden understandably impacted upon creativity and goal threat but there were self-inflicted issues as well. Confusion reigned over Conor Wilkinson’s most effective position, Kieran Phillips was relentlessly played out of position, Matt Taylor’s vice like insistence on a lone front man with others behind or out wide, we signed a striker who was injured & never regained match sharpness and deployed a midfield that almost never broke the lines. All of which contributed to our inability to break down opponents.\n\nGeorge Miller did well, looking particularly sharp in front of goal early on. His game matured over the course of the season and whilst he didn’t score as many as those early weeks suggested he might, Miller finished the season as a robust leader of the line. Some will credibly point to missed chances that limited his haul to 12, and it’s difficult to argue too much apart from offering the counter-argument that we remember the misses purely because clear chances for strikers were so few and far between across winter and spring. Wherever he starts next season, and it seems increasing likely it won’t be in Walsall, he’ll be a far more rounded and deployable player than the player who started this one.\n\nElsewhere, Brendan Kiernan has offered occasional glimpses of threat and I’m sure he’d look far more dangerous in a team with more dimensions than the one from this season. I don’t think that he possesses the moment of magic capacity that Wes McDonald offered but he offers a far more consistent presence than Wes provided. After a change of manager, Conor Wilkinson showed what Jamie Fullarton and Matt Taylor were excited about once played down the middle with a partner. I sense that Keiron Phillips could have contributed much more than he did but his ability was utterly wasted out wide.\n\nFinally, we usurped our traditional and annual dogs-dinner of a January transfer window by paying a fee for an injured Devante Rodney. Time will tell on Rodney’s Saddlers career but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s started well. In fairness, he absolutely deserves the benefit of the doubt given his lack of fitness on arrival, but this was a signing that did nothing for Taylor, Fullarton, Rodney, Pomlett or the team as a whole. Even by Walsall’s January standards, agreeing terms with a player who couldn’t play for weeks and wasn’t fit when he did was poor business.\n\nDefensively, we fluctuated from occasionally promising to uncohesive to bordering on ridiculous with not much in between. Backs to the wall, ugly but deserved, clean sheets at Sutton, Forest Green Rovers and Port Vale were too often undermined by shockers at Hartlepool, Newport and Stevenage. Then there was the horror show at Swindon, an awful defensive giveaway at home to Barrow and the less said about Leyton Orient’s Banks’s visit the better. The only consistent defensive factors were inconsistency and collective frailty. We conceded far too many from set pieces, far too many late goals and far too many of the avoidable variety. Away from home, our inability to pierce the opponent’s resistance was regularly compounded by conceding at the first hint of pressure, al-la Salford. Similarly, our uncanny ability to quickly turn attack into concession was never better highlighted than Rochdale’s help-yourself-to-it winner.\n\nIn terms of personnel, Ash Taylor’s on field performance was in direct contrast to the excitement at his capture. Pedestrian and laboured, Taylor carried the can for the Hartlepool horror show and blessedly made for the exit at the first opportunity. This move was a real bonus, as the pain in carrying him for a further 18 months of substitute appearances and reserve football would’ve been significant, particularly with Joss Labadie and Conor Wilkinson now sidelined for an extended period.\n\nRollin Menayese’s fabulous first few months justified the deal he was offered but that form deserted him literally from the moment the ink had dried. Rollin would have hoped that his evening in Swindon was as bad as it’d get but a 17th minute withdrawal against Orient and the sparsity of opportunity since threatens his Walsall future. Menayese has proved he has the game within him but it’s clear that Flynn has doubts and it’ll be a significant rescue act if he’s to rebuild his career at Walsall.\n\nPick of the defensive bunch was Manny Monthe. At times he has been a giant amongst men and boy did we miss him in January. If he did what he was accused of then he fully deserved the suspension that he got. However, I’m a touch uncomfortable about the FA punishing a player (and club that wasn’t involved in the incident) with such a significant ban based upon “on the balance of probability”. Out of all of our early summer headline captures, Monthe had the strongest impact over the course of 2021/22, however his zero goal return for his height and physical presence is a real set-piece head scratcher.\n\nThe back three system Flynn deploys, incorporating Monthe, Hayden White and Donervon Daniels, looked like they had a plan at times and is probably our best bet for next season. With Flynn having all of pre-season to work on defensive solidity and a settled back line in place I’m expecting us to be much tighter next season. Which, to be fair, shouldn’t be overly difficult.\n\nA couple of new full backs will help that process and they should be easier to source than a new goalkeeper to replace the sublime Carl Rushworth. The Brighton stopper arrived with a highly regarded reputation and 46 games later departed with that reputation bolstered. I’m not a great fan of loan deals but this was a mutually beneficial season that saw Rushworth, his employers and Walsall all benefitting from him joining us. Rushworth looks to have all the tools to go a long way in the game and will take some replacing.\n\nPossibly the only loser in the Rushworth deal was Jack Rose. After shifting Liam Roberts from first choice, the arrival of Rushworth must have been a hammer blow and his lack of opportunity in the final year of his contract probably ensured a parting of the ways. When he did play, he never let us down and I hope he finds a first team chance elsewhere.\n\nAnd so to midfield, where Jack Earing, Liam Kinsella and Joss Labadie have been selection mainstays all season, despite our midfield never really dominating games or winning us matches. Earing often looks wasted playing so deep, the defensive midfielder who isn’t really a defender makes little sense. The experience gleaned from a full season of league football will be invaluable and I expect Earing to progress strongly again next season. Similarly, I would anticipate Flynn finding ways to increase Earing’s output.\n\nJoss Labadie frequently kicked everything that moved and occasionally things that didn’t. At Vale Park, Labadie delivered a full midfield master class, going through his repertoire of dark arts in an hour and a half of grit, determination, sheer bloody mindedness and point-blank refusal to accept anything but midfield control. He was immense but frustratingly, apart from that one dominating performance, I don’t think we ever saw the player that Taylor and Fullarton thought they’d nicked from Newport. The breaking of dressing room sanctum in Matt Taylor’s “I pleaded with him to not get another yellow” in the aftermath of the Scunthorpe shambles probably best encapsulates the frustration of Labadie’s season.\n\nLiam Kinsella is the enigma for me. Player of the Season twice, deservedly I should add, without ever memorably dominating a game of football. Overflowing in energy, commitment and willing, Kinsella has run, tackled, passed and harried himself into rightly being the first name on the teamsheet and deep into the hearts of the fanbase. He genuinely is one of our own. But his partnerships with Labadie and Earing were no more effective than those formed with Alfie Bates, Danny Guthrie, Stuart Sinclair, Joe Edwards, Isaiah Osbourne and/or George Dobson. For all of the many great attributes Liam contributes, his lack of presence in the final third is an issue.\n\nAnd then there is the near-criminally underused Sam Perry. His energetic performance in the heart of Neil McDonald’s 4-4-2 against Tranmere was really refreshing and reminded everyone that his first instinct was always forward. Similarly, Perry’s advance in between the strikers for the deadlock breaker against Port Vale highlighted what we’ve been missing all season (and before). That kind of late movement and opportunist run doesn’t happen with any of Earing, Kinsella or Labadie, all of whom prefer to sit in the pocket without ever genuinely dictating our in-possession play. Midfield needs to be a priority for Michael Flynn over this transfer window, not least because until we find a blend that includes creativity and control, any hopes of a top 3 or play off challenge will be slim.\n\nAway from League 2 football we won two cup games – an EFL Trophy win over a U21s and a scratchy 1-0 win at Kings Lynn in the FA Cup – and were out of all competitions when Swindon knocked us out of the FA Cup on December 4th. That Swindon pulled Manchester City out of the hat in Round 3 and collected the financial riches that arrived courtesy of TV broadcasts and a massive home gate was as painful a kick in the teeth as it gets. Personally, I can’t recall being quite so irritated since Hereford pulled out Manchester United after we stole defeat from the jaws of victory at Edgar Street 32 years earlier. For a club on a limited budgets and only spending what we have this was a minimum £1/2m opportunity that would’ve put a completely different perspective on Flynn’s summer ‘22 shopping activities.\n\nAnd then there was Scunthorpe away.\n\nScunthorpe have won once in 2022 and twice since Halloween. They lost seven straight games ahead of playing us and have squeezed in a further 12 defeats in 16 winless games since. That they beat us, deservedly, whilst playing for an hour with 10 men was a disgrace. Dress it up how you wish, hide behind injuries, suspensions formations and selections if you like, but there are no excuses that truly stand up. We were a shambles.\n\nAt any other club in the country, at any time of the season, that result, on the back of the 6 defeats that proceeded it, was a sacking result. And irrespective of how nice, charming, popular, hard-working, caring or willing Matt Taylor was, there was simply no escaping the inevitable. Looking back, the experiment with Matt Taylor simply didn’t work, despite it feeling like a really good fit at the time. Whilst he and Jamie Fullarton talked a really good game, the sparsity of their team actually delivering the aforementioned good game became an issue that neither could extract themselves from.\n\nTheir policy of early (relatively) high-profile recruitment didn’t bring anywhere near the anticipated level of expected success and the multi-week signing void and subsequent late crescendo of loan deals that followed suggested we’d done the bulk of our budget in week 1. For me, that chunky period with no signings unquestionably meant we started the season on the back foot. A starting position, that in truth, that we never fully recovered from. The only consistent theme being inconsistent performance.\n\nIn the end, Taylor’s loyalty to a system that plainly wasn’t working unquestionably did for him, but you also need to ask questions of his players who followed that shambolic evening and his departure with six points out of six against 2nd placed Tranmere and runaway leaders Forest Green Rovers. They undoubtedly contributed to Taylor losing his job.\n\nThere were positives, albeit fleeting ones. The win at Port Vale, where Taylor looked head and shoulders more of a manager and leader than his opposite number, was an incredible performance. As the Port Vale manager effectively threw his team under the bus with the now iconic “I’m embarrassed” post-game summary Taylor, by contrast, cut a mature, controlled and intelligent presence both on the touchline and in the press commitments that followed. In many ways, he looked an upgrade on Pomlett’s first (and second) manager. That he only lasted 11 weeks and 13 games after Vale Park was as much of a shock as it was unfortunate, but as discussed above, post-Scunthorpe Pomlett had little to no other option\n\nI have a lot of time for Leigh Pomlett and more patience than many. Despite inheriting relative financial stability and control he took on a football club in absolute decline three years ago. Deservedly relegated at the time of purchase, a squad in disarray and wanting out and a fanbase overlooked for the best part of a generation in revolt, this wasn’t ever going to be a five-minute job or one season turnaround. That Covid interfered with his first season and a combination of needing to trade Elijah Adebayo and Burslem Carol’s Clarke chase killed the second shouldn’t be lost, but neither should they be an excuse. After all, Covid affected everyone and Carol really did do us a favour in facilitating a press of the re-set button.\n\nI also fully recognise the fact that this is a big ship to turn around on relatively meagre resources and that he absolutely needs time for the good work he’s already done to take effect. Rome wasn’t built on a couple of transfer windows. He deserves a lot of kudos for the way he has recognised the importance in communicating to supporters and adding a personal feel back into the club. Without Pomlett, surviving Covid might well have been a even greater challenge. That said this season hasn’t reflected all that well on Pomlett. The fact we’re on our fourth manager in 18 months is both damning and damaging, bringing into focus how we identify serious candidates and do our research around them.\n\nSimilarly, the strategic implementation of a Director of Football, a correct pathway in my opinion, was abandoned long before any mid or long term benefit could be measured. A position introduced to bring football nous and knowledge into the boardroom of a professional football club (just have a think about that statement for a moment) and long-term stability, unapologetically abandoned inside a year. Pomlett’s comments on this in his recent Walsall Fan TV interview were confusing and had a feeling of contradiction. One moment praising the impact the DoF had “he did some really good stuff” then almost simultaneously thinking we needed a change “it ran out of runway”. His suggestion that we bought in “considerably more experience” than we previously had expects us to overlook Neil McDonald’s quarter of a century of post playing experience, less than a minute after listing Flynn, Wilkinson & Earing as Fullarton contact successes. Pomlett must have known that this question was coming, not least because the club have sidestepped it themselves, but the inconsistency in the response just doesn’t stack up in my head.\n\nIt was reassuring however that he will revisit this position at a point in the future.\n\nIrrespective of why Fullarton departed however, the fact he said goodbye so quickly raises questions. If Fullarton quit in search of another opportunity, what does that say about us? If Fullarton was pushed what does that say about our pre-employment diligence – for both the role and person? And if we decided the role wasn’t right or the scope was wrong (“the role definition needs to be thought out”), what does that say about our thinking or role creation? In any instance, we come out of it poorly.\n\nPomlett is no fool however, his business history, experience and success simply won’t have been built upon 6-month vanity projects and a hire ‘em, fire ‘em mentality, but what we’ve seen at Walsall is inescapable. I have absolute faith that he’ll get this right and lead the club back to League 1, but there need to be glimpses of light soon. There’s only so long the patience will hold when struggling in a league below our natural home.\n\nThe protests in February were a clear indication of patience being stretched and evidence that the post-Bonser honeymoon is well and truly over. Pomlett’s rabbit-out-of-the-hat capture of Michael Flynn will buy him and the club time, but he has a lot invested in Flynn just now. We enter season 4 of League 2 football without even mounting the remotest challenge at getting out in a positive direction so far, despite the frequent rhetoric around us expecting more. This needs to change and his eggs are almost exclusively housed in Flynn’s basket. If this manager fails and 2022/23 goes badly, which I genuinely doubt for what it’s worth, we’ll all be in choppy waters.\n\nInevitably there’s a lot riding on Flynn and a decent summer transfer window is essential. The 16th place finish we’ve just achieved officially ends the half decade long year on year deterioration in finishing position, but only just. There has been progress but it’s not exactly much to write home about and this has to change.\n\nIn the end, a season that never really got going, faded out without leaving much in terms of memories. We spent over 250 days of a 274-day season in the bottom half and spent as much time in the L2 relegation zone as we did in the top half. It would be wrong to suggest that it couldn’t have been worse, because Scunthorpe and Oldham will confirm it can. That said, adding in the consideration of retaining our league status when determining how successful a season has been is a major indication of just how far we’ve fallen.\n\nIt’s a long way back home from here.\n\n“But, unfortunately, he’s the head coach, and he will be leaving the business with immediate effect.”\n\nLeaving the business! Bloody hell, talk about missing the tone of the moment. Even Jeff didn’t publicly refer to us as the business. It does however offer an insight into current thinking. The mischievous part of my brain has long been telling the well-intentioned side that we’re a small business funding a works football operation and the clumsy use of English in such an important statement does little to deter those thoughts.\n\nAway from the frustration of the announcement, I think it’s pretty universally accepted that a parting of the ways with Matt Taylor was the only realistic conclusion to the run we’re on. Losing to rock bottom 10-man Scunthorpe, winless themselves in six games and with one clean sheet since August, was in the cold light of a relegation scrap, impossible to ignore – the inevitable straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nTo be fair, the camel has been struggling for a while. We don’t score, don’t create, can’t defend, have ingrained issues at set pieces and find ever-incredible ways to concede and get beat. Bristol Rovers somehow took six points off us despite never being in the lead in normal time. Carlisle and Stevenage claimed victories without ever needing to locate the third or fourth gears that neither of them actually possess and Northampton won’t enjoy a more straightforward away win across the rest of 2022. We’ve also taken one point and scored one goal in our two fixtures against possibly the poorest Football League team I think I’ve ever seen – take a bow Scunthorpe.\n\nThe lack of surprise at the set-piece flat footedness that facilitated the gap (chasm) that Scunthorpe exploited was pretty telling. Yes, we all know it was embarrassing but in truth, were you surprised? We’ve been throwing in defensive moments like that for months and as Head Coach, this is and was effectively on Taylor.\n\nI guess I should be honest at this point and note that I really didn’t see this coming. Maybe I was guilty of heart ruling head, but I was convinced we’d improve as this season progressed. Others told me different, particularly in recent months, and whilst I suspected they may be right, I wasn’t ready to listen.\n\nCapitulation and a relegation scrap never once crossed my mind. At least it hadn’t until about a fortnight ago and the Bristol Rovers defeat.\n\nThe warning signs were there from the outset however. Leaking goal after goal from corners early on in the season, an obvious lack of cutting edge, the ease at which Forest Green brushed us aside. That said. Hartlepool was probably the most blatant early marker, but every one of those bad days were neutralised by performances like at Sutton, Leyton Orient and thumping Mansfield at home.\n\nOff the pitch, a truly stellar showing at the first Fan Forum of this season offered more evidence that my hope and belief wasn’t misplaced. It was an evening where both Matt Taylor and Jamie Fullarton demonstrated levels of football intelligence, clarity of thinking and planning beyond anything I’ve ever heard from a Walsall manager. Whilst Darrell Clarke bluffed and bloke-d his way through his Forum, a quietly spoken and far more modest Taylor was considered, clear and convincing. Finally, we’d located a man with a plan, and I absolutely believed him.\n\nNegotiating an overnight M56 closure on the way back from Oldham, I dared to dream. Rory Holden was nearly fit, the new squad was gelling, a first-time coach was learning, the opportunity to improve again in January was close. What could possibly go wrong? Yes, we’d only beat Oldham and they were a shambles, but as I diverted through the dark roads of Wilmslow and Alderley I was convinced that the minimum from this season would be Top 7.\n\nThe win at Sutton soon followed. We were organised, adaptable, had stopped leaking from set-pieces and could win ugly. It was a genuinely ruthless 3 points. More of the same would surely follow?\n\nErm, no. It’s always the infection of hope that stings most.\n\nIndeed, once that October unbeaten run came to an end it’s pretty much been downhill ever since, with every sighting of blue skies punctuated by defensive error, needless concession and the obligatory result destroying late goal.\n\nThat Taylor didn’t help himself at times, is equally obvious. Whilst the novelty of a manager having a belief in a system and sticking to it was uber-refreshing after the formation, selection and substitution roulette preferred by his two immediate predecessors, it was his rigidity to his ethos that contributed to his downfall. Taylor’s dogmatic belief in his 4-2-3-1 system left us without a semblance of a Plan B and provided our opposition with less homework to do and increased time to prepare plans to nullify us.\n\nTuesday also highlighted something that had been bugging me for a while – we have been far too easy to referee. There’s no niggle, no dark-arts stuff, no behind the referee’s eye nonsense – like a reflection of our now ex-manager we’re almost too nice. We frequently put ourselves in compromised positions by picking up needless yellow cards and when things go against us, we either can’t argue for risk of a second card or choose not to. Imagine how Liverpool or Manchester United would have reacted had the opposition goalkeeper handled the ball five yards outside of the penalty area and fouled their striker running through. It was as nailed-on as it gets and we hardly appealed and never blinked. The Bradford penalty, as obvious as it was, was accepted with the minimum of resistance. There’s no pressure for the referee to be sure when you give him a free pass.\n\nYet despite all of the above, I have genuine sympathy for Taylor and don’t for one minute believe him to be the biggest issue at the Football Club business.\n\nHis players let him down, his Director of Football made an absolute hash of the January transfer window (despite the Fan Forum confidence/bluff/baloney) and anyone who thinks the manager is a bigger problem than the board is either blind, in denial or a close relative of Richard, Roy or Peter. Seemingly, no amount of managerial bloodshed appears to prompt a collective visit to the mirror or the thought that maybe it isn’t the just that manager that is the issue here. Don’t worry if you’re out of touch, out of ideas, out of energy or out of the EFL, just hire and fire Matt or Brian or Dean or Sean or Chris or Jimmy or whoever happens to be the next fall guy. That usually quenches the fires of discontent for a few months.\n\nWhoever Jamie Fullarton identifies to pick up the pieces from Matt Taylor will be our seventh manager since Dean Smith concluded he’d outgrown us and our 13th appointment in twenty years. This is neither healthy nor beneficial to long term stability. Similarly, I’d suggest that that level of turnover is a pretty clear indicator that the root of the problem lies elsewhere in the football club business. We’ve tried experience, youth, proven achievers, internal talent identification and club stalwarts – yet all end the same way. Put simply, either (i) they can’t all be dreadful or (ii) whoever identified them needs a new role.\n\nIndeed, if the core business of the business is actually football, I wonder if the board have ever considered why the only constants in the first team over the past decade are a dreadful January transfer window, a lucky-dip dependency on loans and the revolving door of players passing through. The volume of player turnover has to be unhealthy and does nothing to enable managers or the club to establish a style, identity or playing pattern.\n\nSimilarly, the filling out of the squad via youth loans is hurting us internally. Ask yourself – why would you sign youth terms for Walsall when you can go elsewhere and, if/when you make it to anywhere close to our level, you can spend a year here before moving on? The days of come here, make your way through the system, establish yourself at a young age and earn a move tend to evaporate when you’re continually offering these first team chances to Premier League U21s. The goldrush from finding the next Paterson or Henry is severely restricted by a Jake Scrimshaw, Adan George or Frank Vincent sized blockage. If the board can’t see this then I worry what they do see.\n\nThe Director of Football should be in no doubt that he is equally in the eye of the storm. Recruited to add football nous, structure and ensure stability and smooth transition, he is now overseeing the recruitment of a Head Coach, most probably his assistant and also a Head of Youth. We’re staring down the barrel of the National League, the academy feels like it is in the worst state I can ever remember and the consistent conveyor to the first team stopped quite a while ago. If ever football nous was needed, it’s now.\n\nAfter a bright start, our summer business faded. That southern based player we were so confident of signing never arrived and we entered the season without a centre forward of our own, which would’ve been unthinkable at just about any other time I can recall. Inevitably, we exited January in a poorer state than we entered, this time raising the bar somewhat by signing a player who wasn’t even fit. Even SunTanMan didn’t have that one in his transfer playbook.\n\nIt’s evident that the eyes of the fanbase are fixed on the DoF at present. Less than a year into the role, it would be grossly unfair to lump all of the blame upon his shoulders, but he has to carry a level of responsibility. Matt Taylor was his man and these are primarily his players. The Football Club from first team to academy is a shambles and we clearly haven’t got too much bandwidth for error. Identified and employed to permanently move us away from a crisis such as this, Fullarton urgently needs to pull a few rabbits out in his hat. Be in no doubt, the EFL trapdoor is wide open and we have no safety net.\n\nAs for the players, they are equally culpable. Unusually for Walsall, we did some pretty eye-catching early business. Conor Wilkinson, Joss Labadie=, Ash Taylor and Manny Monthe were high profile, budget sapping, early recruits. Whether we knew about what was hanging over Manny Monthe is a moot point but only he out of that batch of early captures has got close to repaying our investment.\n\nAsh Taylor never recovered from a poor start that culminated in a Hartlepool horror show and made for the exit at the first opportunity. Conor Wilkinson has been more in and out than flared trousers. Goals against Newport and Salford emphasise the ability he has, however one look at the Northampton free kick apologetically bobbling past him gives an insight into the flip side of the discussion. That Tyrese Shade was preferred to Wilkinson at the Scunthorpe must-win shouldn’t be lost. I honestly don’t want or mean to be disrespectful to Tyrese but Wilkinson needs to take a long hard look at why Taylor preferred an inexperienced Shade over one of his core summer captures at such a key moment. I’ll offer a clue – he wasn’t sat on the bench because he’s overflowing with on-field contribution. Indeed 16 starts and 4 goals wasn’t anything like the return that we thought we were investing in.\n\nAnd then there is Joss Labadie=. Without doubt the most Adam Chambers type player we’ve had since Adam Chambers, albeit without the same level of consistency, quality or discipline. Taylor, unusually for a manager, wasn’t overly shy of hinting at his irritation of players who made individual mistakes and you didn’t always need to fill in too many blanks to understand his dressing room ire. However, his direct criticism of Labadie’s= inability to avoid another caution at Scunthorpe was every bit as direct and unconcealed as his gushing praise for Liam Kinsella vs Northampton was an indirect censure. The lack of what happens in the dressing room, stays in the dressing room betrayed Taylor’s irritation with his captain.\n\nLabadie= proved at Port Vale that we had a genuine leader who could control a game of football and dominate the opponent. I haven’t seen that player since that fabulous Burslem night and if he is going to extend his stay here beyond one two-year contract, he’ll probably need to re-find that version of himself.\n\nIt may be too late for Taylor, but it isn’t too late for Labadie=, yet. If he can relocate his own form, after suspension, and pull the team back behind whoever takes over we may just have a chance at avoiding falling out of the EFL.\n\nThat we are talking about losing EFL status is a pathetic reflection of where we find ourselves. I admire Leigh Pomlett and think his management of the Covid crisis was fundamentally the reason that the club survived it. I watched his latest video on Wednesday morning, and he looked 15 years older than the guy who took over in 2019 and I’d be gobsmacked if he didn’t regret buying us. I also wholeheartedly believe he is doing everything he can to achieve his stated aims. That said, we continue to lose ground on EFL compatriots, our status in English football eroding season by season. This was always a big ship to turn around after 30 years under the previous incumbent and it was never likely to be the short League 2 tour that some envisaged. Time, and plenty of it, was always required. However, we’re almost 3 years into Project Pomlett, the decline continues and the football starting point is about to be reset for the third time. This has to change.\n\nAnd so another manager/head coach falls upon his sword. I genuinely have sympathy for Matt Taylor because this whole mess is not the fault of one man. Yes, we could defend set pieces better, not concede so late so often and 21st in League 2 will always be unacceptable but he’s only a contributory factor into a wider malaise. The win at Port Vale will always be the water mark to which I’ll hold him in my memory. That night he and his players reminded us all of what we want to be and what we should be, his counterpart contributing fully by reminding us of what we needed to cast aside and leave behind.\n\nFarewell Matt and genuine best wishes. Like others before you, it feels like you were the right man at the wrong time but, just now, it’s clear that we need to protect the business.\n\n“I don’t wish to be rude but how come you’ve ended up here?”\n\nThe question came in the last knockings of Darrell Clarke’s first Q&A night with fans and was very much meant as a compliment. For the best part of an hour and half Clarke breezed through what was the very friendliest of supporter examinations. He had charm, he was cohesive, he had a track record, there was humour, charisma, confidence, flamboyance, warmth and a belief. Most of all, he appeared to be bringing a credible plan, a blueprint out of League 2. It was a first class opening to his time here, he literally had the entire room feasting from his palms. We lapped it up – the post-Bonser boom was up and running.\n\nI’ve honestly returned back to that question many times over the past 20 months. Yet, whilst I suspect any deeper meaning was completely unintended, the clues to ‘why here’ were already evident. Hindsight, once again, proving to be the most belated of guides.\n\n“I don’t talk contract lengths”, “each game is a project”, “I don’t discuss injuries”, “my players, my coaching staff, my chairman, my supporters”, “winning football” – all were magical soundbites from the blossom of a new romance. Yet all became particularly tiresome and irritating as mounting numbers of defeats and draws combined with irrational levels of post-game chutzpah and “nowhere near a top 7 budget” soundbites to ensure that those honeymoon memories had long since faded. Opinions on Clarke have been split for quite a while but it’s clear that there were still many who still believed Clarke was the best man for the job he held. However even within the staunchest remaining believers, and I was absolutely amongst them, there must have been a level of fatigue around the nonsense, belligerence and pretence. I certainly felt it.\n\nThe collective shoulder shrug as news broke of Clarke climbing onto the M6 and heading six junctions north highlighted the likelihood that the ‘kids have grown up and moved on’ conversation really wasn’t all that far away.\n\nBeing completely fair, this was and remains a really tough job. For all the benefits of improved openness, communication and the willingness to listen that Leigh Pomlett re-introduced to the football club, a transformed budget wasn’t one of them. And whilst it is painful to admit, there aren’t many of our contemporary football clubs that currently appeal less. The rarity of long term, multi-contract stays at Walsall in recent times is a decent indicator of this.\n\nA near decade and a half of decline (one short period aside) will never be turned around in a couple of months, even when it comes alongside an upgrade of owner. The major things Clarke needed was time, patience and transfer windows and Pomlett undoubtedly gave them him. He also found the budget to provide Clarke with his top two transfer targets in the very first days of his appointment, with trusted allies James Clarke and Stuart Sinclair recruited to support and patrol the manager’s tone and expectations.\n\nThe blank canvas Clarke inherited also offered a sizeable opportunity to place an immediate stamp on his playing staff. Granted it came with the bargain basement, rough diamond recruitment challenges that building a squad here invariably brings but the opportunity to quickly fill the dressing room with your players is rare for new managers. One or two windows were never going to put everything right, but it did offer Clarke a real chance to make some good strides really quickly.\n\nFrustratingly there were at least as many misses than hits in Clarke’s first season acquisitions. Whilst work-in-progress signings such as Elijah Adebayo and Rory Holden evolved and have impressively thrived within Darrell’s project, others like James Hardy, Jack Kiersey, Nathan Sheron and Rory Gaffney had fleeting and genuinely forgettable Walsall careers. Clarke’s inability (or dogged refusal) to see what everyone else could in Gary Liddle whilst seemingly freezing Zak Jules from plans caused below waterline damage that he never fully repaired.\n\nSummer 2020 was an altogether different proposition. Covid-19 undoubtedly implicated the budget available to the manager but with a settled squad requiring only minor tweaks, hopes of a competitive season were high. Not least when Bristol City agreed to sell us Rory Holden. But amid the glow of a super bit of business, the permanent securing of Holden overlooked one massive point – this wasn’t actually a squad strengthening activity. This was a deal that returned that area of the squad to where it was when the season ceased in March. Essentially, we’d done our biggest and best piece of summer business on standing still.\n\nOn top of this I’d contest any opinion that suggested that the other recruits this summer improved upon what was there before. Because they haven’t. In short, we wasted the opportunity that the rarity of squad stability provided and, if anything, the team and squad went backwards over the lockdown. And that’s before I begin to rant over Danny Guthrie’s second season contribution.\n\nHowever, for all of the above, there has been plenty to be positive about. In that first meeting, Clarke talked proudly about his net profits from developing players during his stint at the Memorial Ground, and this continued just a fortnight ago with the deadline day scramble for Adebayo and Jules. Others have similarly improved under Clarke – Holden, Norman, Scarr and Gordon to name but four and the risk that they depart for greener pastures, or follow Clarke to North Staffordshire, is very real. Similarly, youth got its chance and whilst Alfie Bates is probably the only tangible evidence of Clarke’s willingness to bring players through, I think we’ll see more of a few others before this season is out.\n\nOn appointment, Clarke’s immediate focus rightly revolved around re-setting standards and dressing room cohesiveness. To his credit, the ethos of the dressing room is exponentially better than the snake pit that he inherited. Clearly, improvement on the stench that did for his predecessor wasn’t going to be difficult but amid the many post-defeat frustrations a perceived lack of effort from Clarke’s team never joined justifiable jibes about tactics, formations and individual errors. Under Clarke they never produced less than 100% and this shouldn’t be forgotten. He also found decent (undisclosed, obviously) money for Cook and Ferrier, this despite the fact that the entire football world knew how desperately we wanted rid. Don’t underestimate how well he & Pomlett did here.\n\nLast season’s opening day at Northampton was one of those moments that we’ll all remember fondly. Sold out away support – twice, a new era arrived with temperatures rocketing and hope restored. Clarke opened his Walsall career with the kind of 1-0 win that gets teams promoted. An afternoon where an organised, disciplined, combative, resilient and streetwise Saddlers team took energy from a raucous, high spirited away following and ground out a win that set a benchmark of what could be achieved. They didn’t win that day because they were better that their hosts, they won that day because we all wanted it more. Frustratingly, it was little more than a fleeting glimpse of what could have been – a football version of the speedboat in Bullseye (kids, ask your dad). Look at what you could’ve won… and it was gone long before it got close to getting wet.\n\nIndeed, whilst a Saturday special at Salford, a fabulous win at Tranmere and home win against Bolton intermittently hinted what this team was capable of, their lack of clean sheets, the litany of individual errors and an inability to put teams away when on top in games proved the legacy from which Clarke walks away.\n\nAnd then there was the football. “Winning football” as Darrell likes to describe it. We can argue long and hard over about hoof ball, long ball, the percentage game or pass-pass-lump but only a very few would described it as pretty. And his Saddlers average of one win in three doesn’t exactly feel like the dictionary definition of winning football. Similarly, it’s hard to ignore the lack of clean sheets, 13 in 62 league games to be precise and a full 17 games since the last one. Add in the fact we only managed one solitary 1-0 win since the opening day of the season and the issues become relatively obvious. When you need to score multiple times to win, it tends to limit the regularity of picking up 3 points. Nicking a 1-0 when you haven’t played well or created much is a beautiful and productive habit that we didn’t see or have, and yes, I also struggled to recall the last time we did that.\n\nSo, returning back to the original question. How come he ended up here? For all the talk, all the bravado and all the promise, the Emperor’s clothes proved just a little too transparent. System flexibility is all well and good but after 62 league games I still don’t think Clarke knew his best system, his best goalkeeper, his best centre half pair/trio, his best defender or midfield make up. Elijah was his front man, Holden his number 10 and Scarr an automatic choice in defence. The rest wasn’t exactly bingo, but it was over complicated by projects, bluff and overthinking. Apologies for being somewhat disrespectful but you don’t need a ‘project plan’ to beat Darlington or a no-wins-all-season Southend, you just need to turn up and execute what you do well. The first time I heard Ray Graydon talk he discussed putting round pegs in round holes, players knowing their roles, having a system that works and players can understand, “they’re generally not the brightest” he quipped. And whilst I fully accept that football has evolved in the past 21 years, these are common sense basics that haven’t.\n\nAnd does it really matter if we keep the length of Zak Jules contract secret? Irrespective of a 2 or 3 year deal, he left anyway. All it actually achieved was to irritate season ticket holders and alienate the manager.\n\nHis record at Salisbury and Bristol Rovers suggested Pomlett had struck gold when appointing Clarke. He was a popular appointment and judging by his performance at that opening meet the manager evening his interview would undoubtedly been first class. In reality, Clarke probably struck gold in finding a very patient Pomlett and Burslem Carol’s willingness to part with hard cash probably saved us and Leigh from a messy mid-late summer divorce that, in reality, neither party could realistically afford.\n\nThe basic reality is whilst turning this football club around is a pretty sizeable task, I honestly don’t think that we’re any further forward than where we were on that brilliant opening afternoon at Sixfields. There’s another summer rebuild ahead, probably on the back of a player exodus, new players to develop, a budget that doesn’t stretch that far and a bastard of a league to escape from in the right direction. Truthfully, I’m not sure Clarke fancied it and I suspect he could see the sands of his Bescot time running low. Certainly, the first part of that sentiment has been reflected in some of the interview snippets that have come from his first press conference in Burslem. I’d also evidence the latter by suggesting that Leigh Pomlett’s post-departure video reeked of the fact that he had become jaded by the histrionics and extremities of working with ‘his man’ and our lack of progress.\n\nClarke’s decision to jump ship ensures he leaves WS1 with his headline stock relatively undamaged. However, the baggage that came in the small print was incredibly tiresome and unproductive. I had a lot of time for Darrell Clarke and was happy to cut him, and the doubts I perceived, some slack but there’ll be no sleep lost in my house at his departure.\n\nAs Clarke admitted, he’s done what’s best for him, and that is absolutely his prerogative. You certainly can’t knock his honesty. Right now, however, I think that we need, and the chairman deserves, someone who’ll do the best thing for the football club. Not just today, but tomorrow and the day after.\n\nGood luck Brian.\n\nThe King has chosen to be dead. Long live the King.\n\nWe’re onto Part 3 of our My Top Three series with Darren Fellows offering his choices. If you’ve missed the fist two blogs, please click on the links to catch up on Richard’s Spring 96 blog and Matt’s Ones That Matter. They’re both great reads.\n\nPlease feel free to record your memories about Darren’s choices or add your top three in the comment section at the bottom – we really appreciate all the comments added. We’ll have more of these in the coming days but for now let’s go back to some great times of unity and joy. Enjoy.\n\nUnited We Stand.\n\nThere are so many great moments and memorable goals. So many highs and chinks of blue sky amongst what often feels like a sea of dark grey clouds. Reflection and thinking about this piece tells me that even in the frustrating times there’s some great ones ahead and the goals that define them will inevitably become the memories of that moment. I really could’ve chosen dozens.\n\nTom Bradshaw’s instinctive debut goal at Port Vale, where we saw the first glimpse of what we’d poached was high on my list as was Romaine’s bullet a year later at a deserted Blackpool. Both are modern day special moments. Looking further back, all four goals on that incredible night at Watford were each worthy of note, as was David Kelly’s hat-trick goal against Bristol City. A little further back, it’s hard to choose just one from tsunami of Alan Buckley goals that got me forever hooked and if I’d have been at Sheffield United I’d have probably written about the late penalty that Don Penn converted. For the Bescot years, I considered the two late(ish) goals against Scunthorpe on the penultimate Saturday of 94/95, with Charlie Palmer’s equaliser arguably being the most important goal of the decade right up until the moment Ray Graydon walked through the door. After that, you could choose Andy Rammel’s header that beat Stoke, Chris Marsh’s goal against Oldham or any of the 2003/04 opening day four goal extravaganza against West Bromwich Albion.\n\nBut, whilst they were great, they didn’t make my final three. All three chosen were away from home, all three were important in many ways, all three were in incredible times of club unity and all three are really important to me. So, in no particular order;\n\nAndy Rammell vs Luton Town\n\n26th September, 1998\n\nMy memory tells me that it was little more than a tap in, but he had a bit more to do than that. The Darren Wrack half cross / half cut-back cutting afforded Andy Rammell the millisecond of space and time he needed to get to the ball in front of his marker. A smartly judged and deft first time finish eliminated the goalkeeper from the equation and the ball looped into an unguarded far side of the net. As Rammell threaded himself between the back of the net he’d just found and the converted terrace behind it, an afternoon of frustrating stalemate exploded into celebratory pandemonium. A sizeable and increasingly believing away following going absolutely nuts, mirroring similarly fevered on-pitch celebrations. The realisation that this wasn’t just a decent start to a season, but something more solid was dawning on many.\n\nIt wasn’t particularly pretty, it wasn’t a team goal crafted from twenty-odd passes and to be fair, when the moment came, Rammell (and his manager) would’ve been disappointed had he not converted. But it was brutal, particularly in the simplicity of its execution – a tackle won in front of the back four, a pass that released Darren Wrack on right hand side, the cross that crafted the opportunity and a striker who came alive in that space between the penalty spot and six yard line. It wasn’t route one by any means but it was every bit as cutting. Seven seconds of aggressive and well executed possession that proved the difference between one and three points. It wasn’t the only 1-0 win based on similar foundations in that magical season but it was almost certainly the first ‘marker’ result.\n\nTo be honest, it was a game where we should’ve been long out of sight before Rammell finally broke 86 minutes of deadlock. Indeed the afternoon was a bit of rarity in that magnificent season in the fact we dominated the game and wasted a handful of chances before finally crafting something we couldn’t miss. That we didn’t spend the last fifteen minutes camped in on our 18 yard line was similarly unusual.\n\nFor me, whilst wins at Gillingham and Wycombe signalled that Ray Graydon might have put together a squad and system that looked capable of making those pre-season favourites for relegation look a nonsense, Luton was the first landmark win of what was a truly magnificent season. They were unbeaten at home and had made a strong start. Yes, it was only 1-0 but we battered them for the entire afternoon, arguably all ten outfield Walsall players winning their individual battles.\n\nA line had been drawn, the marker set. We were good, we had something about us and a manager and team who everyone could believe in. Indeed we looked capable of taking on most in League 1 and there was no-one to fear. The next seven months produced far better goals, many more memorable moments and arguably more significant wins, but this is where 98/99 got real for me. That moment when Andy Rammell converted Darren Wrack’s cross is the precise point where I began to believe that miracles could happen.\n\nDavid Kelly vs Bristol City\n\n25th May, 1988\n\nTo be fair, when he received the ball, what happened next can’t really have been in his, or anyone’s, mind. It just sort of happened.\n\nI guess context helps here – we were in injury time of the first leg of a play-off final. Like all play-off games it had been a frenetic affair with almost nothing to choose between the two teams. Bristol City drew first blood and a Graeme Forbes header that forced a bizarre own goal levelled matters either side of half time. Both teams pushed after that, both teams came close but a David Kelly turn and shot edged us in front ten minutes from time. From there on in it was all about protecting the lead and getting back to Fellows Park in the driving seat.\n\nSo, when Kelly received a long defensive clearance in in injury time the requirement was pretty clear. Hold the ball, stall for support to arrive and kill as much time as you possibly can. Don’t give possession away. His first touch, off his knee, was good and suddenly he’s facing the Bristol City goal with a couple of tired and lumbering defenders in his eye-line. Both were petrified to commit and lose the tackle, both were back-peddling faster than an MP caught out by the tabloids and both were clearly petrified of Kelly’s threat. So he ran at them, and they backed off, so he kept running and they backed off. As he edged towards the Bristol City 18 yard line he sensed his opportunity. A couple of jinks created a half yard of space and a killer left foot drive, executed with pin-point precision, somehow squeezed itself inside the goalkeeper’s left hand post.\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the greats.\n\nThe play off campaign of May 1988 probable couldn’t have been any tougher. Notts County were edging their way back to a decent spell in the second tier of English football and Bristol City will always be a challenge in the 3rd tier. For both however, we had a team that was just as good and was every bit a match for both of them. The team that triumphed from this trio was going to need that extra something – that bit of magic the separates the best from the very good. We had it – in the boots of a striker for whom history shows was probably reaching the top of his craft. A striker who netted seven times in five play-off games. Seven times!\n\nIt’s probably worth reiterating that these were goals against the best in the division, they weren’t cash in goals against teams who’d given up or were defensively shot. They weren’t late boot filling opportunities against teams going through the motions either. Four were away from home, two gave us the lead in games, three created scoreboard daylight and all of them really mattered. I’ve seen whole seasons where our striker hasn’t beaten seven goals, yet Kelly did it in three weeks.\n\nI chose this one because it was an absolutely brilliant finish that gets lost in the aftermath of the home defeat and the heroics a couple of days beyond that. Without this the replay would never have happened.\n\nSam Mantom vs Brentford\n\n5th January, 2016\n\nOne of the reasons I so cherish the Graydon era, and the first season in particular was the unity that surrounded the football club at the time. Everyone pulling in the same direction, the support and respect reciprocated both on the terraces and the playing surface. Songs that are positive and rather than negative ones about lesser clubs.\n\n2015 was a similar time. Transfer business in summer 2015 had improved an already strong squad and the ingredients in Dean Smith’s five year plan were cooking nicely. There are no guarantees in football and our escaping League 1 in May 2016 was a long way from happening but let’s be honest, if we had kept going in the manner that the first five months had seen, others were going to have to find something pretty mighty to overtake us.\n\nThen Rotherham came knocking, and Smith’s agent did a far better job for his client than the majority shareholder managed for his investment and our hopes. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThat afternoon at Brentford was properly hostile and the message, ferociously delivered at Smith from behind the goal was pretty unequivocal. The decade earlier re-design of Griffin Park meant that the tunnel was perfectly placed to communicate with the recently departed coaching team and was undoubtedly a key contributor to that afternoon’s drama. The pre-kick off walk from dressing room to dug out absolutely set the tone for the two hours that followed.\n\nSmith, no doubt, would’ve have expected the terrace hostility. However I’m not as convinced that he’d anticipated quite how his former players reacted and rose to the occasion. Brentford were far better than us, they operated comfortably a level higher and were technically very good. But all that goes out the window however when you’re faced with a team possessed with an unbelievable determination to give the man who walked out on them the bloodiest of noses. They tackled all afternoon like they’ve never tackled before, ran miles to cover each other, gave absolutely everything they had and fought for and a hour and a half like their lives depended on it. Every ounce of that effort was cheered from behind the goal. It was, as history shows, the last strands of collective unity we’d see for quite a while.\n\nThe winner when it came was a triumph of all the things Smith built. Paul Downing, a player Smith improved month by month (and subsequently deteriorated every bit as quickly when Smith departed) bought the ball out of defence, across the halfway line and fed the ball to an open Sam Mantom. Tom Bradshaw and Milan Lalkovic immediately pulled out wide, dragging defenders away from the ball and as he edged into range Mantom dragged the ball onto his left foot and curled a beauty into the bottom corner of the net. Ironically, it was a goal that encapsulated Smith’s football philosophies, with control of the ball and selfless creation of space every bit as important as Mantom’s strike of the football. Everyone there will long remember the noise, ecstasy and magic of the moments that followed.\n\nThis was vintage Walsall, standing our ground and sticking one up at those who purport to look down on us. I’ve always cherished the clarity on the fact that you’re either with us or you aren’t. The lack of grey area feels quintessentially Walsall. That post-game celebration and Smith & PinkCapMan’s walk back to the sanctity of the tunnel perfectly encapsulated this and will be a strong memory for a long time.\n\nSo, in these extremely strange times, we at NNP HQ thought we should be getting a bit of content out and giving our readers a bit of cheer. Given we don’t know where we’re at with this season we’ve kept away from the here & now and thought we’d release a series of ‘My 3 Favourite Goals – apart from the ones others may have chosen’. Hopefully it will be a series of five stand alone pieces and within each choice there’s some obvious ones, some not so obvious, some you’ll have forgotten and quite a few that wouldn’t make any goal of the month competition. But they’re all important for one reason or another.\n\nFirst in the hot seat is Richard Hall who takes us back to spring 1996. Enjoy.\n\nEmotion, aesthetics, time and place\n\nHow to choose one’s favourite goals? Aesthetics? Emotion? Time and place? Is it a function of securing promotion, or a cup win, or a late-and-backs-to-the-wall equaliser, or winning that point to avoid relegation? Is it a ‘screw you’ to the world, or is it a moment of hope, or does it unlock possibility, or is it balletic and full of grace, or does it define some kind of physical and intellectual capacity by an individual or a group of players that is beyond what I could ever do?\n\nThe goals that stick out for me unlock a mix of emotions, memories, thoughts and ways of seeing the world. Mark Rees’ first league goal against Northampton Town in January 1980 was a wonderful volley from the edge of the box that arced over the keeper. It was emotionally-important as it was the last game I saw with my Grandad, as I started going with my Dad instead. Kevin Summerfield’s equaliser away at Liverpool in February 1984 must have been fiction, because you don’t score that kind of goal in front of 10,000 travelling fans at the soon-to-be champions of Europe. Any of Stuart Rimmer’s hat-trick at Roker Park in February 1989 to end that losing streak count, because I was bored of being ridiculed by my friends and trolled by my team.\n\nKyle Lightbourne’s winner against Scunthorpe United in April 1995 was a lob that seemed to hang in the air forever and ever, and I thought that was never going in under the bar, and when did, fleetingly, Bescot felt like home. Chris Marsh’s decisive second against Oldham in May 1999 mattered because it happened in front of us, and he was one of us, and that season was so improbable. It carried the emotion of a true underdog story. Tony Barras’s headed equaliser at home to Wolves in January 2000 almost took the roof off the Gilbert Alsop stand, and was a real ‘screw you’.\n\nAnd there is Darren Wrack at Lincoln, and Darren Byfield in Cardiff, and any of Merson’s, and Romaine Sawyers at Blackpool. Any of these and all of these are my favourites. And there will be others.\n\n1995/96: context is key\n\nHowever, at this moment I feel that context and narrative arc are as important as aesthetics and emotion and time and place. So the three I have chosen are all from March and April 1996. I had forgotten how close we had been in the end to the play-offs. And the league table represents our apparent mid-table, Division 3/League 1 existence that has been the background to my life.\n\nOn reflection, we were trundling towards our usual spot somewhere between mediocre and obscure. However, this was a really important time in my life. I was in the second year of my PhD, and had just emerged from a winter spent in the York Minster archives and the Borthwick Institute of Historical Research in York. York in the winter is one of my favourite places, and who doesn’t want to spend their time researching the role of the clergy in 18th-century elections? Plus, I got to see Walsall win away at Bootham Crescent in the rain.\n\nIt was a time when I was feeling more sure of myself, and it also coincided with the best seven weeks I have had playing football (which is not saying a lot). It was exactly seven weeks, and at the end of this period, my huff-and-puff approach resurfaced. Odd. Anyway, the world felt less concerning than it had, and less of a concern that it would become. Maybe this was also reflected in the fact that I always regarded that post-promotion season under Chris Nicholl as a free hit, in which the team, management and fans were a little more carefree and able to snub their nose at the world they were in. Otherwise, there is no way we can explain the 8-4 against Torquay United in the FA Cup.\n\nNB I remember that season for Uriah Rennie refereeing at our home game against Bournemouth, and when the fans chanted “the referee’s a wanker”, he looked at us, smiled, and shook his head. A great response\n\nScott Houghton vs Swindon Town\n\n9th March, 1996\n\nThe first of the three goals that stand out was Scott Houghton’s equaliser in injury time away at Swindon on 9 March 1996. We had already taken a point from Steve McMahon’s title-winning team at home before Christmas, in a game where Jimmy Walker pulled off a wonder save with a knackered shoulder. In the away game I always felt we matched the team that would finish well clear at the top, and I was devastated when Swindon took the lead in the 84th minute. What I remember of Houghton’s equaliser is a cross-field ball from Martin Butler falling to Houghton at the far post and a scuffed shot, which appeared to be hit with the studs and trickle in at the near post. I always felt that if he had hit it properly then it would have been saved, but the scuff deceived the keeper, and those of us in the stand lost it.\n\nWell I say those of us in the stand lost it, but what I actually remember is that I lost it, and I very rarely lose it, and that I was standing by the family enclosure. Punching the air and yelling in the direction of eight-year-olds is not a good look. It was also not a good look when the same thing happened in 2007.\n\nIt turns out that Houghton’s goal was a scruffy end to a great move. A let’s give-it-a-go move, that saw us move the ball across the back four, with some good movement in midfield, an incisive cross, some dreadful defending, a great run into the box from Martin O’Connor (see below), and a good take and set up by Houghton. However, it was the scuffed shot and the deserved point against a much better team that gave this the flavour of ‘mighty mighty Walsall.’ There are highlights available, with the bonus of analysis from Mark Lawrenson of the goal from 5’20”. The only thing that is missing is footage of Adrian Viveash, who left Swindon to join us, diving in front of the benches in celebration.\n\nMartin O’Connor vs Peterborough United\n\n30th March, 1996\n\nThe second goal is from three weeks later, away at Peterborough. The previous Wednesday a lumbering defender had stamped on my standing foot when I was playing football, and so I was on crutches. In spite of that, it was still important to stand at London Road, because the roof on the away end had great acoustics, and I always remember that there was a great view of Peterborough Cathedral. It’s always nice when you can see an historic monument from a football ground.\n\nI remember us going two-down in this game and looking ragged, and then getting back into it before half-time. It reminded me of the home game against Crewe a couple of weeks before, when we were being destroyed by their passing game and were two-down, and came back to win late on. There was something devil-may-care about us. We were that mid-table team that was going to mess with your season, and you would come to loathe us as a result (see below). Mind you, there was also a dreadful 3-2 away defeat at Oxford, when we were in charge until Martin O’Connor inexplicably handballed in the area.\n\nSo, halfway through the second half, and it is two-all. Peterborough have a corner from their right, which floats across the goal and is picked up on our right by Charlie Ntamark. Spotting Kyle Lightbourne bombing up the left flank, he hits a beautiful, Beckham-esque crossfield pass, which is just far enough ahead of the attacker to maintain his momentum. Lightborne skins one defender and gets to the byline, where an inch-perfect cross is met by Martin O’Connor who has gone box-to-box and reached the penalty spot. O’Connor’s header powers past the keeper, and is a thing of beauty. In fact, on this planet (and I believe that the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics holds) there is nothing more beautiful than a headed goal.\n\nMartin Butler vs Blackpool\n\n27th April, 1996\n\nSomething was building. Had we found this form a couple of months earlier, we would have made the play-offs, and then who knows? But we would not have had Graydon. And we would have lost Ian Roper to some no-mark Championship team. So what would have been the point?\n\nInstead, what was building was our ability to destroy Blackpool’s season on 27th April. I remember the crumbling old away end at Bloomfield Road, with the sun burning down from the West, such that I got sunburned on the right-hand side of my face. But who cares, right, because we have that amazing strike from Martin Butler from 25 yards that was still rising as it hit the back of the net. Cue joy in our end, and despair from those in tangerine. There was something about the goal being scored at the home end, in part because I had such a good view from the banked terrace that we occupied, and in part because it stunned them.\n\nBlackpool had looked odds-on for automatic promotion, and now were under stress from Oxford United, who would pip them to the second automatic promotion spot. Hilariously, they then blew a 2-0 lead taken in the play-off semi-final first leg, by losing 3-0 at home to Bradford City. I tell my Bradford City friends that we took the wheels off Blackpool’s season, and gave them a shot at glory, which ultimately led to their time in the Premiership.\n\nIt was Martin Butler what won it, and who would have thought that given the abuse he received during his first stint with us?\n\nNarrative arc\n\nThere we are. A scuffed daisy-cutter following some free-flowing and incisive passing; a break from nothing with an inch-perfect cross-field pass, a delicious cross, and a bullet header; and, a thunderbolt. And all these within six weeks, as I found a renewed sense of self, and we settled back into our sense of being mid-table and occasionally disruptive.\n\nWe finished nowhere, and so these goals were irrelevant. Yet, they were also very relevant, because they signalled possibility. Of course, there is emotion and aesthetics and ability in these goals. However, they are great in their own way, precisely because they stitch into an important time of possibility in my life, and a time of possibility for the football club following promotion.\n\nIt’s the context and the narrative arc. Always the context and the narrative arc.\n\nSo, as a final look back at the decade, I’ve put together my WFC Best XI from the past ten years. I’ve discounted loan only players so, for example, George Evans misses out and it’s rather attacking focused. Some choices were easy and obvious, others not quite so.\n\nI doubt that anyone will agree with all selections so please feel free to add any changes you’d make in the comments section.\n\nAs grim as the 2010s were, we also had some amazing footballers you know.\n\nRichard O’Donnell (GK)\n\n2013-2015\n\nAppearances – 105\n\nGoals – 0\n\nIt was a genuine flip of the coin between O’Donnell and Neil Etheridge. Indeed, had I accounted for career progress after Walsall then Etheridge would have got the nod. Comfortably.\n\nIn the end I went for O’Donnell on the basis that he retained top form right up to the moment he left, whereas I felt Etheridge dropped a level once he knew he was leaving.\n\nBoth Etheridge and O’Donnell were super consistent and there were weaknesses amid the breathtakingly good. In O’Donnell’s case it took a change in play to maximise his abilities and a coach as smart as Dean Smith to adjust his defence to allow this.\n\nDuring his early appearances it was evident that O’Donnell struggled to deal with crosses on the cusp of his six yard line (see Bristol City’s first at Wembley as a late WFC career example) so Dean Smith found a way of driving teams inside to either cross diagonally or shoot. And when it came to out and out shot stopping O’Donnell was utterly brilliant.\n\nThe save that will always stand out is the one at Preston but over the course of 105 appearances O’Donnell established himself as one of the better goalkeepers I’ve seen in a Walsall shirt. A genuinely brilliant shot stopper with eye-opening reflexes and strong with the ball at his feet, O’Donnell could’ve played much of his career at Walsall had we been able to match the pay structure of others, particularly Wigan. I genuinely don’t think that his departure cost us anything in the following season’s promotion challenge but we haven’t had a goalkeeper better than O’Donnell since the day he left.\n\nIt’s worth noting that ROD’s career never reached the heights of his time at Walsall and I genuinely think this is due to the impact of Dean Smith and his ability to mask the flaws.\n\nJason Demetriou (RB)\n\n2015-16\n\nAppearances – 52\n\nGoals – 4\n\nAn absolute gem from Dean Smith’s little black book of past players & contacts. Having worked with Demetriou at Leyton Orient, Smith bought Jase back to English football in the summer of 2015. Somehow Demetriou had been allowed to drift for five years at AEK Larnaca but from the moment he kicked a ball at Walsall he became a genuine fan favourite.\n\nOne of the new breed of full back Demetriou’s real strength was blasting forward – an ability that regularly pinned his opponent in defensive mode and probably masked the fact that he’s not the greatest defender that the world has ever seen. To be fair though, he didn’t need to be as Smith’s 2015/16 side looked to defend on the front foot, dominate possession and attack at every opportunity. It was a system built for a player like Demetriou and he had a magnificent and all to brief 12 months in a Walsall shirt.\n\nThe goal against Gillingham is probably the single moment that most remember him for and it absolutely secured his place in folklore but he was a fabulous footballer in a fabulous period to follow us.\n\nDemetriou wasn’t the only player we recruited from Cyprus over the decade but he was significantly superior to what followed. He departed as part of the post play-off exodus stating that he wanted to be closer to his London home. He’s been true to his word at Southend ever since and of all who transferred to non-Championship clubs, Jase probably made the best move of all.\n\nRico Henry (LB)\n\n2014-16\n\nAppearances – 58\n\nGoals – 3\n\nWhen he made his debut at a smidgen over 16 years of age, standing in for an injured Andy Taylor in a JPT game at Tranmere, almost the entire left side of the team seemed focussed on protecting their very young team mate. By the hour mark they’d seen enough to stop worrying about a player who was already comfortable at the level he’d just risen to. Six months later, Rico Hendy had effectively ended Taylor’s impressive Walsall career and was an automatic choice when Dean Smith selected a left back.\n\nA wonderfully talented footballer, with the turn of pace required in a modern top-end full back, Henry’s rise and departure was every bit as quick as it was impressive. Henry’s ability to tackle and understanding of when to do so marked him out almost immediately. Similarly his marauding runs forward both with the ball at his feet and in support of others was mighty impressive and a level above anything many of us had previously seen in a Walsall full back.\n\nIn the end Henry’s departure left a sour taste with many feeling the sale was too early, short in valuation and the fact it was Brentford (again) rather grating. Post Walsall, Rico’s career has been limited by a series of injuries but with Celtic sniffing round last summer and more suitors sure to follow as that initial 5 year deal runs down we may just see a little more value added to that deal in the near future.\n\nAndy Butler (CB)\n\n2010-14 & 2014\n\nAppearances – 183\n\nGoals – 14\n\n“Give everything you have for the badge on the front of your shirt and they will never forget the name on the back.” Whilst Butler never said this I can’t think of a quote that is quite as appropriate.\n\nThe day Andy Butler joined was the precise moment where the mid-decade revival began. Butler openly admits his career was going nowhere when he first signed a WFC contract but the drive, motivation and leadership he demonstrated infected a football club that was desperate for a leader.\n\nWe’ve had better players and more accomplished defenders than Butler – James Chambers being an obvious example. But in a sport where the importance of positive influencers is often overlooked Andy Butler stood head and shoulders above every Walsall player over the decade as a positive influence on the team, his dressing room and the football club as a whole.\n\nButler’s heart on sleeve style, the unwillingness to accept defeat, the obvious desire to reward the unwavering support from the stands and the realisation of the responsibility to the shirt and club set the tone that others simply had to follow. If Smith was the brains and architect of our improvement then Andy Butler (and Adam Chambers) were his on field lieutenants.\n\nI guess the pinnacle of his Walsall career came at the other end of the pitch with that ‘it had to be him’ headed tap in at Molineux but that does significant disservice to the other 180 odd appearances where he fought tooth and nail for the shirt on his shoulders and badge on the front.\n\nAnd whilst I wrote this in a previous blog, it’s worth repeating. If you never saw the 1998/99 team and want to know what they epitomised have a look at Andy Butler and his qualities. He wouldn’t have been out of place in that first Graydon team.\n\nAs a footnote, he’s been gone for half of the decade but even at Scunthorpe on Wednesday, where he was an unused substitute, his song got an airing. You don’t have to be Messi or Ronaldo to be a lifetime darling of the Saddlers faithful, you just have to give your all, every time you play. Which I guess takes us back to the opening quote – he gave his all, we will always recognise that.\n\nJames O’Connor (CB)\n\n2014-17\n\nAppearances – 123\n\nGoals – 3\n\nSolid, dependable, honest, professional. You’d have thought Jon Whiney could have tried to lean on these qualities, rather than ostracise them. And how we missed his calming authority over the following couple of years.\n\nI have a lot of time for James O’Connor, a player who knew exactly what he was, understood his own limitations and made the very most of the abilities he was given. He was Mr 7/10 week after week, rarely winning man of the match plaudits, rarely losing his individual battle, consistently delivering consistency and stability to the spine of the team and his back four. I looked on YouTube for a JOC video but it’s virtually bare, which kind of reflects the type of player he was – nothing flash, being effective was always more important that catching the eye.\n\nWhatever happened to facilitate his premature departure and why isn’t really the point here but I do wonder how the WFC board allowed a struggling manager (who was never going to turn things around) to force O’Connor’s departure. That JOC got on with it and never did his washing in public is testament to his manner and professionalism.\n\nThe epitome of Mr Dependable, you can be sure that we’ve missed the input of this player significantly more than the manager who jettisoned him since they both departed.\n\nAdam Chambers (CM)\n\n2011-19\n\nAppearances – 331\n\nGoals – 2\n\nEverything you ever wanted a Walsall player to be.\n\nA magnificent ambassador for the football club off the pitch and an incredible force on it. It’s been 18 months since he last kicked a football and we still haven’t replaced him.\n\n331 appearances with two goals, both in his first ten games meant that there was only one midfield place available for the majority of the decade. A captain who led by example and an integral figure in every good Walsall performance, run, win and achievement since 2010.\n\nChambers was probably Dean Smith’s first priority signing but he repaid that loyalty multiple times over in a stellar Saddlers career that extended as long as it did because of how professionally Chambers looked after himself. A genuine giant of this football club, last year’s foot injury denied him a place in the all-time top 20 WFC appearances (he’s 22nd). An automatic choice for most of the decade, Chambers should also be hugely proud of the fact that he’s the only player to ever lead a Walsall team out at Wembley.\n\nIf I could’ve had a career playing for Walsall, I’m pretty sure I’d have been satisfied to have had one like the career Adam Chambers produced.\n\nI also understand why Darrell Clarke handled the fact Chambers was out of contract last season, particularly as he wanted to bring his ‘own men’ into the dressing room. However, this football club would be significantly better for employing the man, the professional, the captain and all of that experience he brings in some capacity. He has too much to offer to let someone else tap into it.\n\nSam Mantom (CM)\n\n2012 & 2012-16\n\nAppearances – 153\n\nGoals – 19\n\nI’ll get the gripe out of the way first – the way he left us left a sour taste. We’d treated Mantom extremely well over the years. He got his break here, we went back for him, we carried him for a year after a mystery holiday injury, Smith sacrificed Michael Cain to squeeze his own player into a Wembley final… I could go on. That he repaid that by cashing in on Scunthorpe’s spendathon doesn’t sit well by me, irrespective of the crazy numbers Scunthorpe offered. I just felt like he owed us a year.\n\nThat said there were times in this decade where he was an irresistible force in the Walsall midfield. An initial loan spell bought immediate joy as Manton dovetailed beautifully with Florent Cuvelier. We won games we’d have almost certainly lost without the pair’s midfield drive and a decent spring enabled the team to enjoy a relatively comfortable April & May. Recruited again 12 months later, Mantom again did enough to justify the calls for the move to become permanent and the club turned an Albion youth product into a League One midfield force.\n\nMost of the good Walsall displays across the decade have included input from Sam Mantom and it’s no coincidence that our March/April slip up in the 2015-16 promotion chase coincided with a dip in Mantom’s own form and performance. Similarly, when Mantom was good, then so were we. Nothing epitomised that more than the 0-4 win at Blackpool, where Mantom literally ran the game at his pace and the 0-1 win at Brentford where the fans need to win that day manifested itself in a Mantom performance full of drive and determination. Yes he took an early bath for two yellows but he tackled everything that moved that afternoon and plenty that didn’t.\n\nIf you want to know where the Walsall players were mentally on that afternoon at Brentford, have a look at the reaction when we scored and won. Don’t tell me they weren’t sending a message to their former manager.\n\nJamie Paterson (LM)\n\n2010-13\n\nAppearances – 101\n\nGoals – 16\n\nThe best young footballer produced by the football club this decade.\n\nThe first Dean Smith youth product to get his chance in the Saddlers first XI. Obviously it helped that Smith was now manager but in reality he was that good it really didn’t matter who was manager.

And whilst Brandy and Grigg were good, Paterson was simply on a different level.\n\nFrom a selfish viewpoint, Paterson probably broke through 18 months too early.
