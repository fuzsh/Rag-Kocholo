        "meta_description": "Background Susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) can be a useful MRI biomarker of an occlusion but its relationship with clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is yet to be fully elucidated.\n\nObjective To investigate SVS in relation to the clinical outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever (SR) as first-line approach in patients with AIS.\n\nMaterial and methods We included patients with a first-line SR approach for anterior AIS from the the Contact Aspiration vs Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization (ASTER) and THRombectomie des Artères CErebrales (THRACE) trials when both baseline imaging of SVS and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were available. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the presence of an SVS (independent core laboratory), and the overall distributions of the mRS score at 90 days (shift analysis) and clinical independence (mRS score ≤2) were compared.\n\nResults 217 patients were included and SVS was diagnosed in 76.0% of cases (n=165, 95% CI 70.4% to 81.7%). After adjustment for potential confounders, SVS+ was significantly associated with 90-day mRS improvement (adjusted common OR=2.75; 95% CI 1.44 to 5.26) and favorable outcome (adjusted common OR=2.76; 95% CI 1.18 to 6.45).\n\nConclusion Based on results for patients of the ASTER and THRACE trials receiving first-line SR treatment, SVS was associated with lower disability at 3 months. Large prospective studies using MRI-based thrombus evaluation are warranted.",

        "text": "Ethics approval The ASTER protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT02523261) and the consent form was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile de France VI (ID 2015- A00830 -49). The THRACE trial aimed to compare intravenous thrombectomy (IVT) alone with IVT plus mechanical thrombectomy using SR to determine their effect on clinical independence at 3 months in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients were included within respectively 4 and 6 hours of symptom onset in the THRACE and ASTER trial. The THRACE protocol was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes III Nord Est Ethics Committee and the research boards of the participating centers.
