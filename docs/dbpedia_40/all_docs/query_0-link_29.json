        "text": "No, there's no built-in command for that.\n\nWhen I want to split on a <Space>, I do r<CR>.\n\n--- EDIT ---\n\n@keith-nicholas' comment reminded me about this question. FWIW I came up with an hopefully \"universal\" method in the mean time:\n\nfunction! BreakHere() s/^\\(\\s*\\)\\(.\\{-}\\)\\(\\s*\\)\\(\\%#\\)\\(\\s*\\)\\(.*\\)/\\1\\2\\r\\1\\4\\6 call histdel(\"/\", -1) endfunction nnoremap <key> :<C-u>call BreakHere()<CR>\n\nThe easiest way I've found to split lines in Vim is the normal mode command gq (type both letters in quick succession in normal or visual mode):\n\nIn visual mode, it will split whatever is selected.\n\nIn normal mode, you follow gq with a motion.\n\nFor example, gql will split one line to the currently set width. To set the width of the split lines to be different from your current setting, you can use\n\n:set textwidth=<n>\n\nWhere n=number of characters you want in a line, e.g., 10, and change back to your normal width when you're done.\n\nGot this information from a Youtube video by Kholidfu that shows how to join and split lines in normal mode using a motion: Vim Tutorial - Join and Split Lines.\n\nYou can use the s substitute request with the \\r carriage return. Consider a file with this sentence at line one:\n\nThis is sentence one. This is sentence two.\n\nThen this will split the sentences into two lines:\n\n:1s/\\. /\\r/\n\nYou can record a macro:\n\nin normal mode type \"q+\" to start the record. press \"i\", the macro you want to record. then press \"q\" again to stop recording.\n\nto use the macro go to normal mode and type \"@+letter\".\n\nin my case I used the \"b\" to use this macro: to record type in normal mode \"qbiq\" to use type in normal mode \"@b\""
