        "text": "Did the best just get even better? From the moment the No Date version of the Tonda PF was released, I was sure this was the glorious pinnacle of the Tonda PF line-up. It is the perfect purist take on the Tonda PF that loses the date window and introduces a stunning Golden Siena dial. How could it not be? I had a chance to find out when the watch landed on my desk for review. With a huge smile on my face, I was more than ready to put it on my wrist and be mesmerized by the Parmigiani Fleurier Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date. But did it manage to do so?\n\nWe have had quite a few Tonda models in the office over the years; it is a special occasion every single time. The watches have a certain grace and sophistication that many luxury watches lack. The elegant curvy lines, incredible detail, and majestic presence of the Tonda PF line are nothing short of impressive. Factor in the incredible production quality and the unique design, and you have a line of watches that leave a lasting impression every time. And that’s precisely what it did over the last three years.\n\nThe story of the Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date\n\nAfter introducing the first Tonda PF, Parmigiani Fleurier surprised us with a series of remarkable, complicated versions. The brand has done exceptionally well integrating complications into the Tonda’s minimalist design. It has led to great praise from the media and fans alike. I am definitely one of those fans, and my absolute favorite is the Tonda PF GMT Rattrapante. The clever integration of the GMT Rattrapante complication is nothing short of brilliant. However, the brand chose a different route for the new Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date. Instead of adding elements, this new version is about leaving elements out instead of adding elements. As a result, this new version is a purist’s dream!\n\nLet’s go over the details. The watch has a 40mm stainless steel case that is only 7.8mm thick, measures 45.6mm from lug to lug, and is water resistant up to 100 meters. It features a platinum hand-engraved bezel and a modest 4.3mm crown on the right side of the case. Combining the knurled bezel and the teardrop lugs gives the Tonda PF line its undeniable character.\n\nThe natural flow from the lugs to the integrated bracelet is flawless and gracious. It gives the watch a much more elegant presence than most of its comparable contemporaries. The three-link integrated bracelet matches the design flawlessly and has a butterfly clasp. The case and the bracelet feature a clever mix of brushed and polished finishes that show great sophistication.\n\nThe dial is where you find the story of this new Tonda PF\n\nThe show’s true star is the brilliant Golden Siena dial with its Grain d’Orge hand-guilloché finish. Most of you would call this a salmon dial, and that’s an easy reference, of course. It’s no secret that we also refer to it this way at the Fratello offices. As some of you will know, this is not the first time we have seen a dial like this used for the Tonda PF. In 2022, Parmgiani released a similar version of the date version in collaboration with Revolution and The Rake that Sky covered. If you look at the images of both watches, it seems the earlier version is slightly more pinkish, while this new version has more of a golden hue.\n\nThe new Golden Siena dial combines small hand-applied rhodium-plated indices and features a slightly recessed minutes chapter ring. The chapter ring’s minimalist style and the intricate pattern of the center part of the dial create a beautiful visual contrast. The indices almost seem more like the elements that connect the center and outer part of the dial than hour markers.\n\nIt’s a beautiful minimalist design with a helping of subtle detail from the beautiful dial pattern and the meticulous finishing of the different elements. Speaking of which, the only element on the central part of the dial is the proud “PF” logo. Together with the small indices and the delta-shaped rhodium-plated gold central hour and minute hands, they give the dial its character.\n\nThe in-house PF703 caliber\n\nIf you turn the watch around, you will see the brilliant in-house PF703 caliber. The ultra-slim micro-rotor movement is only 3.07mm thick and features a platinum oscillating weight. It operates at 21,600vph and offers 48 hours of power reserve. The same movement also powers the date versions of the Tonda PF Micro-Rotor. Besides being super slim, the movement is also meticulously finished. It features Côtes de Genève, perlage, and polished bevels. On top of that, the platinum micro-rotor is also finished beautifully with a Grain d’Orge guilloché pattern that resembles the dial pattern.\n\nSpeaking of which, my immediate thought upon seeing the new model is that you don’t need a date window in this glorious minimalist symphony of elements. And during my time with the watch, I didn’t miss it once. One of the reasons why I prefer this new version is that the version with the date has it placed at 6 o’clock. I am not against date windows but prefer them at 3 o’clock. It’s a visual balance that I prefer because it doesn’t put the date on the vertical axis of the watch. I perfectly understand if people have different opinions, but to me, this is the way. No date at all works best for the Tonda PF.\n\nWearing the Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date\n\nWhat immediately stands out when you put the watch on the wrist is its tremendous wrist presence. But that also translates to its size. Most of you know that a watch with an integrated bracelet wears larger than its (40mm) size on paper would have you think. The Tonda PF is no exception. It has seriously wide shoulders transitioning from the lugs to the bracelet. Essentially, that gives the watch more visual mass. As a result, I understand that this watch is not for people with smaller wrists. Luckily, Parmigiani also offers a 36mm version that will suit smaller wrists perfectly. We were surprised how well that model (which was also delivered to HQ) wears on a variety of wrist sizes.\n\nDespite its aforementioned large visual presence, I had a blast wearing the watch. Its slim profile makes it easy to wear, and its superb build quality and intricate details make it one of the best watches I have recently worn. Granted, I am a big fan of the style that Parmigiani introduced for the Tonda and Toric collections. The minimalist designs are full of detail, which makes it a joy to explore the watch from all the different angles. As I explained in last Sunday’s Sunday Morning Showdown, Parmigiani has created a design style that is intriguing and will indeed have me looking forward to everything that is to come.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Parmigiani Fleurier Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date\n\nOn the wrist, the watch truly shines. It is a stylish luxury statement with significantly more class and style than most counterparts without ever feeling pretentious. Additionally, I loved the combination of classically curved elements and more modern parts. They give the watch a distinct relevance that is hard to top. The watch’s significant weight also stands out when you are wearing it. It is substantial but never too heavy, and the weight subconsciously adds to the feeling of wearing a really well-made watch.\n\nAs to the date, you probably already know my verdict. I absolutely adore this new dateless version of the Tonda PF. Without the date, the dial and hands take center stage in a perfectly balanced minimalist creation. This latest iteration of the Tonda PF has quickly become a favorite of the entire collection. Yes, I do love it more than the Tonda PF GMT Rattrapante.\n\nThis beautiful statement of style is the one for me. At €26,400, the new Tonda PF Micro-Rotor No Date is competitively priced in a field of great competition. Whether you pick this over the usual suspects in this category is highly personal. I can say that this new Tonda PF impressed me deeply, so I would pick it over most of its competitors. It’s simply that good."
