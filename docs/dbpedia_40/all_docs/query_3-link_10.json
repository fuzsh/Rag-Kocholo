        "text": "*PhD offer* deadline for application : 18 april 2024 We're seeking a PhD candidate in our group on \"light-matter interactions in nanophotonic structures integrating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD)\". This topic will be realized with our collaborator from NTU, Sanghoon Chae for the 2D material fabrication. The candidates should have a real passion for experimental work, especially clean room fabrication of micro-nanostructures (photonic crystals, metasurfaces) since the nature of the proposed work is primarly experimental. A particular interest in the optical characterization of photonic structures is also essential. Tasks include utilizing a specialized optical setup, which enables the experimental reconstruction of band structures through both angle-resolved and wavelength-resolved micro-reflectivity. We're seeking candidates who possess a robust affinity for fundamental physics. A background in nanophotonics and/or solid-state physics is highly desirable, as it will facilitate greater engagement with the project’s objectives and enhance the overall research process. Details on the position are described in the attached files.
