        "text": "URWERK resumes its time leaps. We left off at the heart of Amerindian civilisations and we’re now plunged into the core of Mesopotamian civilisation, specifically the city of Ur, from which URWERK draws its inspiration.\n\nIn 3000 BC, the inhabitants of Ur, the Sumerians, defined the very first unit of time, laying the foundations for time measurement as we know it today. Their golden number was 60, for 60 seconds and 60 minutes.\n\nEnter the second edition of the 100V, Time and Culture line. As URWERK’s co-founder and artistic director Martin Frei explains: “Through my reading and my travels, I’ve been fortunate enough to discover all the richness and diversity of the Sumerians. Their mythology is rich and fertile, their constructions truly timeless. This astonishingly little-known civilisation is fascinating. For this new creation, I loved staging some of its hallmark features: mythology, astronomy, astrology and time measurement.”\n\nOn this UR-100V joining the Time and Culture line, the hours and minutes are displayed alongside data on the Earth’s rotation. Once the 60th minute has passed, the minutes hand vanishes and reappears as a kilometre counter. It illustrates the 477.29 kilometres covered every 20 minutes by every inhabitant of Ur. This is the silent journey made thanks to the Earth’s rotation. At the exact opposite end of the scale is the Earth’s revolution around the sun, i.e. 35,742 kilometres per 20 minutes. On the face of the UR-100V, hours and kilometres share the same status, the same value scale."
