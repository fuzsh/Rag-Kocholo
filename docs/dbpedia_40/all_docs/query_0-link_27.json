        "text": "1.Introduction\n\nTrade in foodstuffs (e.g., wine, brine, smoked meat) and in heavy raw materials (both metallic and non-metallic, such as copper, lead, marble) during the Roman Empire followed complex traffic patterns. Trading routes crisscrossed and intertwined around the Mediterranean, sometimes anchored in older channels established during the Republic period [1]. This article deals with this aspect of research with a special focus on south-to-north and north-to-south flows in the iron trade, between the Mediterranean and Gaul.\n\nThe exploitation of mineral resources in the territories conquered by Rome since the Republic period was of prime importance. It generated large-scale trade to supply all spheres of expanding Roman civilization with raw and semi-finished iron products. From the 2nd century BC onwards, iron became a widespread material used in all aspects of Gallic and Roman life–household activities, arts and crafts, weapon-making, construction and all forms of architecture [2]. Maritime trade played a major role in this trend because it allowed, as it continues to do today, the circulation of heavy materials over great distances, and because the Mediterranean Sea was the heart of the Roman Empire, as indicated by its Latin name: Mare nostrum (“Our Sea”).\n\nThe Rhône River was a major axis of communication linking maritime trade from the Mediterranean to the provinces of Gaul, Britannia and Germania. Its many branches and ports around its delta facilitated the development of impressive volumes of trade. At the outlet of the middle branch (Saint-Ferréol Rhône), 45 wrecks were discovered, opposite Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer (Bouches-du-Rhône, France). The majority of the vessels (31 out of 45) carried cargoes of metal ( ), and 23 transported only iron in the form of bars ( ). To date, these constitute the largest assemblage of artefacts of Roman iron trade, attesting to the importance of this trade route, despite the risk of shipwreck in the delta in particular caused by offshore bars [3,4].\n\nAt the same time, Gaul was certainly the region in the Western Roman Empire with the largest iron deposits from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD [5,6]. Huge mining operations in Gaul produced hundreds of tons of iron per year. From north to south, the iron production areas of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse (Wallonia, Belgium), Sénonais-Pays-d’Othe (Yonne, France), Puisaye (Yonne and Loiret, France) and Montagne Noire (Aude, France) have been recognized in literature [5,6]. According to results of recent research programs that will partly be presented in the present paper (cf. Funding for the detailed list of these programs), Eastern Condroz (Wallonia, Belgium) in northern Gaul and Canigou (Pyrénées-Orientales, France) in southern Gaul can be added to the list for a total of six main iron-producing areas.\n\nIt follows logically that the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer wrecks and these six iron production areas in Gaul must be considered together in a study of the iron trade in the western part of the Empire. Such an investigation will also provide information about the geographical scope to be taken into account when sourcing antique iron, especially in Europe (such as whether a continental or regional approach is most relevant). It will also inform the sampling strategy to be implemented to meaningfully determine the chemical signature of a production area encompassing a very large number of smelting sites.\n\nThese last decades, provenance studies of iron artefacts were developed by several research teams [7,8].They are based on two complentary approaches. The first one considers that the chemical signature of Rare Earth trace Elements (i.e. their respective ratios) of the initial ore and more widely of the reduction system (i.e. ore, furnace lining etc) is preserved from the slag discovered on the smelting sites to the fragment of these slag that remain entrapped under the form of inclusions in the metallic matrix of the produced metal. Coustures et al [9] were the precusors of this approach but it was significantly refined particularly by introducing statistical data treatments of the results to examine the provenance hypothses [9–13]. The second approach is based on the principle that the isotopic signature of some elements initially present in the ore is preserved in the metal. Here, the isotopic signature of the metal of the artefact is compared to the one of potential ores. These last years, studies using the Os [12,14,15] and more recently Fe isotopes [16,17] were implemented with a relative success. Both approaches present their pro and cons. The “slag inclusion/trace elements” approach considers between 10 and 20 elements, allowing a powerfull discrimination between the potential sources. Unfortunately it needs to perform invasives sampling and also sometimes complex statistical approaches. The isotopic approach allows one to consider directly the metal and not the slag inclusions entrapped in it, but is far less disctriminant than the first approach because of the overlapping of the isotopic signature between different ores and region (for Fe isotope see for example [18]). Moreover, reference data are not so numerous up to now for the isotopic approach.\n\nConsidering that the most effective approach is the one based on trace elements in slag inclusions, especially because a high number of reference sets of slag were already analysed and are available for comparison, this paper aims to set a new milestone in the traceability of iron in the western Roman Empire, breaking new ground by performing a first-ever statistical analysis of the data on this same set of artefacts (the iron bars of the Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer wrecks), based on 12 trace chemical elements, as well as analyzing four additional iron bars, for a total of 13 iron bars. Moreover, this article publish for the first time recent results from research programs on Gallo-Roman iron production areas (see Funding part for the detailed list of these programs), making it possible to analyze an extensive collection of more than 120 smelting slags from six production areas, which constitute a yet unpublished chemical database for determining the origin of iron in the western Roman Empire. In a first stage, the compositions of the smelting slag found in the considered production areas are compared. Then, these compositions are compared to the one of the slag inclusions entrapped in the artefacts, or different parts constituting an the artefact (called “Primary Pieces of Metal: PPM). Actually some bars are only formed by one single PPM, some other types of bars are made by welding togheter several PPMs (cf. infra and [19]). Thus PPMs constituting a given bar can potentially have different provenances. This comparisons will allow us to distinguish different provenance groups for the artefacts (caracterised by a similar trace element chemical composition). Some of these groups are compatible with the composition of the slag of some of considered production areas (i.e. areas where the iron ore is smelted into metal). Lasltly, these archaeometric results are discussed by confrontation with archaeological considerations to propose a new vision of the exchange networks during the antiquity between Gaul and the Mediterranean.\n\n3. Analytical methods\n\nRepresentative samples of at least 3 cubic centimeter were taken using a diamond saw on the smelting slag found on the production areas (Figs – , ). They were then ground to a powder, with a grain size of about 70–80μm. Major and trace elements were quantified using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS), respectively, at CRPG Nancy France [43].\n\nConcerning metallic bars, cross-sections were made on the complete artefacts using a SiC cutting disc. After a first grinding and polishing (SiC papers grade 180 to 4000), the welding lines indicating that a given bar is constituted of several Primary Pieces of Metal (PPM) welded together are searched. If they are detected, sub-samples are taken on each PPM. Otherwise, only one sample is taken. In a second step, samples are polished (diamond paste 3 and 1 μm under ethanol). This allows an observation by Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope to locate and analyse the non-metallic slag inclusions (made of a mix of silicates, oxides and vitrous phases) entrapped in the metallic matrix. The major element composition is determined by Energy Dispersive Spectrometry coupled to SEM (a FESEM JEOL 7100 equipped with an Oxford silicon drift detector, at 15kV with a probe current of 20nA). Prior to any spectrum acquisition, SI were detected by means of image analysis of the backscattered electrons signal. Particle detection and spectra processing were performed using the Aztec Software (Oxford Company). On each spectra the background was substracted using a top hat filter. The XPP correction routine was used for quantification (Phi-Rho-Zed matrix correction with inner standards). A fixed set of elements composing the iron slag is considered (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Mn). Concentrations were normalized at 100%. The analytical methodology has been described in detail elsewhere [10–12,44]. An important step in this procedure is the identification of those inclusions deriving from the ore reduction stage (the only ones that can be compared with the slag found on the production sites). Actually during the manufacturing of the bar, especially when welding together different pieces of metal (PPM), or during the shaping of the bars, some fluxes (clay, sand,…) could be added and generate new families of inclusions [45]. To differentiate these different kinds of slag inclusions (SI), the procedure proposed by Disser [46–48] for this identification was followed. Families of inclusions are determined based on major elements, especially non-reduced compounds (NRC: MgO, SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, CaO). In the thermodynamic conditions that take place in shaft furnces, these oxides are not reduced and their respective ratio do not change [45]. Several tens of inclusions were analyzed. This allows by a statistical and spatial consideration to identify different inclusions families by their composition [48] and to select the ones not located in the welding zones. Some 10 inclusions deriving from the ore reduction stage were then selected for LA-ICP-MS analysis. The VG Plasma Quad PWSX setup coupled with an Nd: YAG laser (wavelength of 266 nm) at the Centre Ernest Babelon (IRAMAT UMR7065) was used for this purpose. Ablations lasted 50 seconds with laser frequency set at 7 Hz and ablation diameter set at 80 μm. The quantification method developed by Gratuze [49,50] and adapted for SI studies [10,51] was employed. Thirty-eight trace elements were quantified, with an accuracy error usually below 12%. The net recorded signal for each trace element was normalized using the NIST610, NIST 612 international standards [44].\n\nThe trace elements considered in this paper are Ce, Eu, Hf, La, Nb, Nd, Pr, Sm, U, Y, Yb and Cs. This list of elements is the result of a compromise between the desire to study a maximum number of rare earth elements and the fact that only a limited number of trace elements have been analyzed in published studies on iron bars that are also included in our comparison set. Following the procedure proposed by [10] and [12], trace element contents were normalized using a log ratio approach given by the equation:\n\nXE=ln([E])−1N∑k=1Nln([Ek])\n\nGiven [Ek], only the elements that were quantified for the whole reference set were considered: Y, La, Ce, Sm and Eu. The resulting variables were named “xij”.\n\nStatistical data analysis was performed on xij. The chosen multivariate analysis method was principal component analysis (PCA), sometimes in combination with hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) (FactoMineR and factoextra packages in R software). For PCA, it is verified if the composition of the slag inclusions of a metallic artefact graphically match with the one of other artefacts or the one of the slag of the production sites on all the 2D projections on the PCA dimensions gathering a significant part of the cumulated variance (> 75% generally). For the HAC the chemical compatibility is confirmed when the maximum distance separating two slag from a production area is greater than that separating the inclusion of an object from the nearest slag. The advantages and limitations of this approach compared to alternatives have been widely discussed elsewhere [8,10,12]. This approach was preferred here for its relative “neutrality” as an unsupervised method, compared with other methods such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, which may result in the incorrect grouping of artefacts into separate classes (for example, artefacts from the same reduction system–the same ore, furnace lining and charcoal–may be incorrectly separated because they come from two different smelts). These are aspects that should be investigated in more depth in the future.\n\n6. Discussion\n\nSome of the bars studied have been attributed to a Montagne Noire origin, in previous studies based on a more limited number of chemical elements. The groups G2 and G3 from Coustures et al. [9] (1L SM2 T2/SM2-96-KL-Y2, 4C SM2 T1/SM2-4-B and 4C SM2 T3/ SM-2-3-A-1) were considered to be consistent with a Montagne Noire provenance. The present study, which analyses a wider spectrum of trace elements, clearly shows that our group G1 (corresponding to group G2 from Coustures et al. 2003) is not compatible with Montagne Noire. Among those bars analyzed by Coustures [9], only one (4C-SM2-T3) remains consistent with this origin. Nevertheless, in the present study, two new PPM appear to be compatible with the Montagne Noire production area: 1L SM10-2-L1 and L2. The major element content of the slag inclusions of these two PPM had already been studied by Pages [19]. Manganese was found only in the slag inclusions of the latter artefact ( ). This suggests that low levels of manganese in slag inclusions cannot be considered as an excluding factor for Montagne Noire, as confirmed by the variability of composition for this element in the slag.\n\nIn the present study, PPM 2L-SM9-T1A presents slag inclusions that are compatible with the chemical signature of slag from Wallonia (Eastern Condroz and Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse), as suggested by the principal component analysis. The case of the other two PPM (2M-SM6-T2A and T2B) must be discussed here in more detail. In the first stage of statistical inference (during which all chemical signatures were compared), the signature of the slag inclusions of these two PPM fit in with the Wallonia area on all the projections. Again, the signatures were consistent with Wallonia on projections for the first three components (79% of variance) when the two samples were compared to slag from Wallonia only. Unfortunately, once a fourth component was added (90% of variance), the slag inclusions of the two PPMs no longer plotted in the Wallonia areas in the Dim1/Dim4 projection. And yet, when hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) was performed on the same set of data, the inclusions of the two PPM were not placed on a separate branch from the Wallonia slag. As a result, it can be considered that the chemical signatures of the inclusions are very close, although not identical, to the Wallonia slag. This is a situation where the decision to attribute an artefact to a given production area is not straightforward. The Wallonia production area is defined by a relatively low number of slag samples. Moreover, slight variations in reduction processes could result in chemical signature variations of the same order of magnitude as the difference between the SI composition of 2M-SM6-T2A and T2B. In light of these considerations, we have decided to attribute these two PPM to one of the Wallonia production areas from now on.\n\nIt is interesting to note that all the PPM with slag inclusions containing phosphorus– 4L-SM24-1-L1, L3, L4 and 4L SM24-2-L1 [19]–are located in the same area of the PCA projection when all PPM are considered. This suggests that these bars have the same provenance area, so this hypothesis will be considered to be true from now on. The SIs of 4L-SM24-2-L3 are also located in the same zone on the PCA projection, despite the fact that no P was detected in the slag inclusions [19].Therefore this PPM was considered to be part of a separate group of provenance: GP2.\n\nThe highlighted similarities correspond to a chemical reality that we can take into account today to hypothesize about distribution networks in ancient times. shows the network built based on PPM provenance. Each PPM is a node that is linked to the other one if it belongs to the same provenance group. PPM coming from the same bar are shown in the same color. It displays a diversity of production origins, which reflects the abundance of smelting sites that existed in the western Roman Empire. Eleven different sources were found for the 22 PPMs analyzed in 13 bars. Some bars are made up of PPMs originating from the same source: this is the case for 2M SM6 T2, 1L SM10-2 and 1L SM2-1. Conversely, two bars were revealed to comprise multiple sources: these are 4L SM24-2 and 2M SM9 T1. Therefore, one bar can encompass multiple provenances if it is made of several PPMs. The manufacture of bars from iron of different origins has been evidenced for protohistoric and medieval semi-finished products and has long been assumed for the Roman period [19,53–55]. This proves that at least some bars were manufactured in specialized workshops separate from the smelting sites. Roman authors support this segmentation of production stages at separate sites. Diodorus of Sicily, a contemporary of the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer bars (Universal History, Book V, XIII), wrote that on the island of Elba, \"They melt the blocks [of ore] with the force of fire and share them to reach appropriate dimensions, and their appearance is similar to large sponges. Traders buy or exchange them and bring them to Dicaiarcheia [Pozzuoli] and other trading places. Some people buy this merchandise there and gather a large number of specialized blacksmiths who process it and make all kinds of iron figures out of it.”\n\nAnother network analysis ( ) can also be used to describe relationships between provenance groups and bar types (nodes). On the one hand, bar types 4L and 2M belong to specific provenance groups: four different sources for type 4L and four different sources for type 2M, including Wallonia. On the other hand, bar types 1L and 4C are both linked to two provenances, which are different from those for types 4L and 2M and include Montagne Noire. Type 6C is represented by one sample from yet another source (G2). And yet, previous studies have demonstrated that bar types are linked to iron quality [19]. Type 4L bars seems to be mainly made of phosphoric iron; 2M bars are ferrite and 1L and 4C are equivalent heterogeneous steel bars (categories defined by [19]). Type 4C bars have a short shape and made of mixed ferrite and steel. Type 1L bars have a long shape and also comprised of mixed ferrite and steel. This suggests that provenance groups are associated with specific iron qualities (or at leats types). The writings of Pliny the Elder (HN, liber XXXIV, XLI) confirm this view: “This diversity [of irons] is due first of all to the nature of the soil and the climate; some lands provide only a soft, lead-like iron; others a brittle, coppery iron, which should not be used to make wheels and nails; the first species is suitable for these uses.”\n\nA given source is not associated with more than one quality of metal (for example, Wallonia is linked only to ferrite types; while G1 and Montagne Noire are also linked only to types made of mixed ferrite and steel). Likewise, each stamp is associated with only one provenance group: stamp 9 (IVL//EROTIS) with G1 and stamp 10 (S//LEPEDI//N) with Montagne Noire. However, a stamp may correspond to bars of different types with the same provenance. It should be noted that only three stamped bars were considered in our study. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the significance of these stamps. As we have seen, we distinguish production areas defined by a same slag composition, not isolated smelting sites. Moreover bars are sometimes formed from different PPMs at specialist workshops that are distinct from the smelting sites. Therefore, it is possible that the iron bars were stamped in the workshops that assembled PPM to produce the bars.\n\nNext, if we plot a graph connecting shipwrecks and provenances of the bars constituting their loads ( ), we see the formation of different clusters that do not contradict the other network analyses. It is interesting to note that the wrecks carried iron from different origins. However, the bars from Montagne Noire and Wallonia were not carried on the same ship. They apparently belong to two different trade networks: one for iron from the North of Gaul and the other for iron from the Mediterranean basin. The SM6 wreck assembles bars from Wallonia, as well as the unknown provenance groups G2, G4 and G5. These three groups are linked only to that wreck and bar types 2M and 6C. The SM9 wreck carried bars from Wallonia and from provenance group G6, which is not linked to any other shipwreck. It can therefore be assumed that these wrecks and the Wallonia provenance group belong to the same commercial network, with products coming from the North of Gaul. The SM10 and SM2 wrecks carried iron from Montagne Noire. The SM2 wreck also transported iron from the provenance group G1. Iron from this provenance group was found only in that wreck. Again, it would seem that these two wrecks and provenance groups form another coherent commercial network containing only 1L and 4C types of bars. Lastly, the SM24 wreck transported phosphoric iron (type 4L) from provenance GP as well as three other provenance groups (GP2, G1a and G3), very probably forming a third commercial network for iron from an unknown provenance.\n\nConsequently, at least two different iron bar trade networks passed through the mouth of the Rhône River: one from northern Gaul that included Wallonia and one from the Mediterranean coast, probably near the Narbonne harbor, that included iron produced at Montagne Noire ( ).\n\nIron trade from northern Gaul via the Rhône to the Mediterranean dates back to at least the 2nd century BC and most likely the beginning or even before the Roman conquest of Gaul. Indeed, a set of 15 radiocarbon dates for two SM6 bars and two SM9 bars indicate that the transported iron was produced between 240 and 51 BC and between 196 and 69 BC, respectively [42]. The Bagaud 2 wreck (Hyères, Var, France, end of the 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 1st century BC) provides another example of this iron trade between Gaul to the Mediterranean prior to the Roman conquest [56–58]. This wreck carried tin ingots stamped Hypokeltoi (meaning \"Celts from below\" or \"from the south\") and type 2M and 4C iron bars. This metal trade from provinces close to Germania or from Germania is also attested between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD by the SM1 wreck (Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, Bouches-du-Rhône, France) and other Mediterranean discoveries of lead ingot [58–61]. North-to-south iron trade via the Rhône continued until at least the middle of the 2nd century AD, based on data from the Saint-Gervais I wreck (Fos-sur-Mer, Bouches-du-Rhône, France), which contained lead ingots from Britannia and type 2M iron bars [58,62]. Stamps on iron bars also bear witness to this north-south trade in the ancient period, notably with the Aedui Gallic tribe (Bourgogne, France, type 2M) and Bituriges Cubes (Berry, France, type 1M) known for their metal production [63,64]. Also attesting to this trade is the recent discovery of a GALLICUM stamp by Luc Long on a type-2M bar from the SM33 wreck off Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer ( ). This trade developed along commercial routes already in use since the Bronze Age and through Protohistory for the trade of tin and iron, especially from the south of England [2,58,65]. It can be understood that this north-to-south trade was long anchored in the multiple iron production areas of Gaul, Germania and Britannia, as can be seen from the diversity of the chemical signatures (at least four) analyzed in this study.\n\nThe iron trade from the Mediterranean Sea via the Rhône to the North (at least as far as the Arles harbor) is partly linked to the ironmaking aicrea of Montagne Noire and therefore to the Colonia Narbo Martius (Narbonne, Aude France), the capital city of a Roman province whose harbor was, according to Strabo (IV, 1, 12), the “main port of the whole of Gallia Celtica” at the end of the 1st century AD. This trade appears to be more recent than that developed in the north after the conquest of Gaul. The SM2 and SM10 ships would have circulated between 23 BC and 60 AD and between 5 and 163 AD, respectively, according to the 15 radiocarbon dates for four bars [42]. No further evidence of south-to-north iron trade via the Rhône is provided by archaeological, archaeometric or epigraphic documentation. Moreover, generally speaking, the trade in metals from south to north seems much less significant than from north to south [58]: only two sources refer to this area. The reason for this imbalance is that the production of metals (especially iron) is greater in the north of the Empire than around the western Mediterranean basin [5,66]. During the Roman Empire, metals could be found only around Elba island and Populonia or around Narbonne, in the Montagne Noire area and the Canigou massif, and to a lesser extent in Corbière and Ariège."
