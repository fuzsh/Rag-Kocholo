        "text": "If the luxury media are regarded as the storytellers of fine living, decoding the spirit and essence of good taste for the consumer through slick glossies, hyper-visual reels and smart listicles, then the retailers would naturally be the culture tellers of our time. For it is the retailer who, with razor-sharp insights on the market, knows what it is that drives collectors wild with frenzy, and who, with strong relationships with the different manufactures, knows when, where and how the industry is evolving.\n\nGood retailers in particular are more than mere middlemen, inasmuch as all of them do represent that last-mile connection between brand and customer. On top of the requisite wide product offering and great service quality, the separation of the proverbial wheat from chaff in the retail business happens when passion and personality enter the equation.\n\nBecause when there’s passion, the retailer becomes an active participant in the fine watchmaking industry — and this is undoubtedly an industry that so capably stokes the fire in our hearts. A retailer with a strong personality, whether that comes from a dynamic company founder or a team of dedicated visionaries, is one that forms true bonds with the watch buyers, so that they grow together in their journey as enthusiasts or collectors.\n\nAnd to that we say, there’s no better time to commend that than now. We are proud to present Revolution’s Top 20 Retailers, a select company of heroes, from family-run global enterprises to the dedicated individuals who dominate their corner of the region, all of whom represent the best voices in the business, and whose influence, passion, and drive to educate and cultivate the very best of watch culture, we laud their efforts in elevating the watch community to where it is today.\n\nAhmed Seddiqi & Sons\n\nThe world and indeed the Middle East was a very different place when Ahmed Qasim Seddiqi started his watch business in 1950. From humble beginnings buying and selling watches out of his cabinet before starting his own shop in Dubai’s Old Souk (traditional market), to becoming one of the first retailers for Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet in the Middle East, and supplying more than 90 percent of the world’s luxury Swiss watch brands in that market in the years following, Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons has come a long way, respected as a pioneer of luxury retailing in the Middle East, and one of the reasons behind the UAE’s rise as one of the top shopping destinations of the world.\n\nPresently, the company remains a family business, operated by the second, third and fourth generations of the Seddiqi family. It now boasts a portfolio of over 80 luxury timepiece and jewelry brands that range in value from premium to high luxury, sold through more than 50 locations throughout the UAE.\n\nFrom making strategic inroads into the region and going on to becoming a public-listed enterprise in 2002, another milestone in the company’s growth is its acquisition of another major Singapore-based luxury watch retailer, Sincere Watch, in 2021, for S$85 million. It is understood from Cortina’s company reports that Cortina’s main focus would be on international luxury brands, while Sincere Watch lays a greater spotlight on (but not restricted to) boutique brands and independents, the likes of Greubel Forsey, H. Moser & Cie., and Laurent Ferrier.\n\nAs of financial year 2023, Cortina Holdings saw a 15 percent growth in revenue to S$827 million, for a 13 percent rise in net profit to S$84 million; on a net worth of some S$382 million.\n\nSincere Fine Watches\n\nFounded in 1954, Singapore’s oldest luxury watch retailer was not just the go-to for the top brands of the day, but was also a forward-thinking champion of independent watchmaking, playing a significant role in the success of such brands as Franck Muller and F.P. Journe before they became the runaway successes that they are today. The last two decades have seen the company change hands more than a few times, and the dust looks to have settled after its acquisition by Cortina Holdings in 2021, setting the storied retailer on a stable footing for ambitious plans afoot.\n\nFor starters, Sincere Haute Horlogerie, a specialist boutique dedicated to independent watchmaking that Sincere operated from 2005 to 2016 was brought back in September 2022 and rebranded SHH (the old name was “a bit of a mouthful!” according to CEO Ong Ban), with a new concept boutique at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.\n\nBrands showcased here include Greubel Forsey, Grönefeld, Chopard L.U.C, Laurent Ferrier, Armin Strom, Lang & Heyne, and Czapek & Cie. New SHH boutiques have been added since, in Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\nSincere had been a long-time advocate of horological education and appreciation, with collectors’ events and workshops, and it’s been reported that there are plans to bring back the much-missed Sincere Watch Academy next year to mark Sincere’s 70th anniversary.\n\nThe company presently has more than 23 boutiques and points-of-sale across Asia and Australia, with a portfolio of some 40 brands, with around half of these brands available for purchase/order via its online store.\n\nStephen Silver Fine Jewelry\n\nEstablished in 1980 by gemologist Stephen Silver, the company began as an estate jewelry business in the Silicon Valley area, where over the course of the last four decades, Silver established for himself a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts in asset-class-colored gemstones and museum quality jewelry. Notable stones that passed through his hands include the Cullinan Blue Diamond necklace, a historic piece he went on to purchase and donate to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the Pink Promise Diamond, which after Silver’s recut achieved a price-per-carat world record at auction in 2017.\n\nSilver was subsequently joined by his son Jared Silver, who extended the business into the timepiece sphere by developing and launching the company’s timepiece division in 2014. In step with the company’s high and fine jewelry offerings, the timepiece division focused on rare and exceptional marques, drawn mainly from the who’s who of independent watchmaking. These include MB&F, Greubel Forsey, H. Moser & Cie, Urwerk, and Laurent Ferrier.\n\nPresently, the company is a vertically integrated, global wholesale manufacture and retail operation with emphasis on diamond and colored stone cutting, custom design services, and rare, collectible timepieces. Besides a boutique located in Silicon Valley at Rosewood Sand Hill resort in Menlo Park, the company also operates a private showroom and offices in Redwood City.\n\nMajor expansion is in store for 2024, which involves a 35,000-square-foot mixed-use retail and dining development that will house a mix of flagship mono-brand boutiques, a unique members’ club-like showroom, Michelin-starred gastronomic experiences, and more.\n\nEthos\n\nIndia’s largest luxury watch retail chain opened its first store in 2003 and after becoming a public limited company in 2007, has averaged more than two new boutique openings every year for the last 20 years, totalling more than 60 multi-brand boutiques and mono-brand shops across 23 cities in India. Thereafter, the company became public listed in 2022. The chain offers a broad swathe of luxury timepieces from major international brands to a smattering of independent watchmakers, numbering more than 60 at last count.\n\nEthos also offers certified pre-owned luxury watches.\n\nExplains Chairman and Managing Director Yashovardhan Saboo, “We believe that our growth potential is inextricably interwoven with India’s rise on the global economic and consumption landscape… We aim to capitalize on the growing demand for entry- level products as well as middle to high range products in the premium and luxury segment by expanding our retail footprint.”\n\nBesides the scale, performance, and the constellation of the most prestigious watch brands in its portfolio, The Hour Glass is also a recognized leader in its field for doing things a little differently for the furtherance of watchmaking culture. Beyond the usual watchmaker meets for collectors, it also organized the Tempus watch fairs in the 2000s which brought the Swiss watchmaking experience to the general public.\n\nOther brands represented by The Hour Glass include Akrivia, F.P. Journe, De Bethune, Kari Voutilainen, Sarpaneva and Urwerk.\n\nWatches of Switzerland\n\nEstablished in 1924, Watches of Switzerland began in the U.K. before branching into the U.S., numbering 22 multi-brand and mono-brand showrooms in the U.K., and nine in the U.S. More than 50 watch brands are represented, covering a broad sweep of the luxury watch brands, supplemented by pre-owned watches from numerous brands, and certified pre-owned watches from Rolex.\n\nThe company is actually part of the public-listed Watches of Switzerland Group which also owns several other retail chains in the watch retail trade, some of which date back to the 18th century, like Mappin & Webb and Goldsmiths. All tallied, and counting the digital retail platforms, the group boasts 211 showrooms at last count, with revenue exceeding GBP 1.5 billion (a rise of 19 percent from the last financial year), with nearly 90 percent coming from sales of luxury watches.\n\nOperating profit grew 26 percent to GBP 179 million and the group ended the 2023 financial year with GBP 469 million in net assets.\n\nIn breaking the “rules” and eschewing convention for its own sake to champion creativity and individuality, it was only natural that Picciotto famously opened his store in 1988 without knowing anything about watch retail, only what he didn’t want. And that was enough to make the store a success, and attract other like-minded individuals on the adventure, as Chronopassion became the place to be for the rarest, most exclusive and unique watches.\n\nMajor brands do figure in its portfolio, but Chronopassion is a natural fit for the fiercely creative world of independent watchmaking. There are cult watches; and Chronopassion comes as close as one can think of, most aptly located in a trend-setting city such as Paris.\n\nCellini Jewelers\n\nFounded in 1977 by Leon Adams, Cellini Jewelers has been an independent purveyor of fine jewelry and luxury watches in New York City for over 40 years. It first opened as a boutique within the Waldorf Astoria in New York, and since 2018, has moved to its larger Park Avenue location in midtown Manhattan.\n\nJewelry offered ranges from bespoke pieces and in-house designs to creations from top brands, such as Carrera y Carrera, Oscar Heyman, Sara Weinstock and Wellendorff. For watch shoppers, in addition to major luxury brands, the company also offers a broad range from some of the most innovative and exclusive independent watchmakers.\n\nThese include De Bethune, Ferdinand Berthoud, Greubel Forsey, Grönefeld, Laurent Ferrier, Romain Gauthier and Urwerk. It also carries clocks from L’Epée and MB&F.\n\nAs Leon Adams explains in an earlier interview with Revolution, “We are the only store in NYC that has an extensive selection of both watches and jewelry. We are pretty unique that we have jewelry from the very affordable all the way up to super important gemstones.\n\n“We don’t only deal with the mainstream watch brands and the groups, as most stores do. We are doing that, of course, but we have a huge and diverse collection of independents that you can’t find anywhere else in New York.”\n\nEsperLuxe\n\nEsperLuxe makes a fitting poster child for the contemporary business model that is the product of timeless principles of enterprise, namely passion and vision, colliding with the context and realities of our time — aesthetics, community and connection in the era of social media. Company founder Christopher Daaboul was working with his father on the wholesale side of the watch and jewelry business when on a visit to Baselworld in 2014, he stumbled upon “The Palace,” a tented pavilion away from the comparatively glitzy main exhibition area, where independent watchmakers were showcased.\n\nIt was an “OMG” moment for Daaboul. He says, “It completely blew my mind. There were so many watchmakers and creators that were on the cutting edge of design and mechanics.\n\n“There was so much creativity inside of that group, and it was very personal talking to the watchmakers with their creations in hand.”\n\nDaaboul gave himself five years to set himself on the trajectory to get into this scene; EsperLuxe was founded in 2019, an online store that leveraged rich visuals and editorial content to build a watch community of consumers and independent creators, a platform for learning about and purchasing independent brands such as De Bethune, Urwerk, Akrivia, Kudoke, Arnold & Son, and Angelus. Steadfast growth since its inception has also led EsperLuxe to its first brick-and-mortar collaboration with its retail partner Date & Time in the Boston area.\n\nEsperLuxe is presently an authorized retailer of roughly 10 brands, and is a sponsor of the Académie Horlogère des Créateurs Indépendants (AHCI), doing its part in nurturing the next generation of watchmakers.\n\nDoux Joaillier\n\nAway from Paris that is disproportionately the doorway to France for many, this family business has instead chosen other very scenic parts of France to site its boutiques. It started with Richard Doux setting up his manufacturing workshop in the 1980s after graduating from the Lyon Jewelry School, then opening shops in Avignon in southeastern France, known for its medieval architecture, Courchevel up in the French Alps, and Saint-Tropez by the coast on the French Riviera. Doux’s sister Diane followed a decade later, opening her shop in Nîmes, famous for its Roman architecture.\n\nToday, the company owns seven boutiques in these locales, consisting of multi-brand boutiques, and mono-brand stores for Rolex and high jewelry brand Messika. Stores are equipped with watchmaking workshops staffed by brand-certified watchmakers to provide a comprehensive range of repair and maintenance services, and there are also jewelry workshops to serve customers who desire custom jewelry.\n\nThis expansion began with the company’s first mono-brand boutiques in 2008, for Rolex (the first in Europe) and Patek Philippe (the first in Italy), respectively; its multi-brand flagship store in 2016; followed in quick succession by mono-brand boutiques for Vacheron Constantin (2018), Hublot (2020), and A. Lange &amp; Söhne (2023). True to its watch-repair roots and refined customer experience that earned the company’s reputation as “the salon of Milanese haute horlogerie”, these boutiques are not just beautiful spaces befitting of the luxury products offered, but the flagship, Rolex and Patek Philippe boutiques also feature on-site workshops — what Pisa 1940 calls “watchlabs” — to offer a comprehensive suite of technical support services, including immediate service intervention where necessary.\n\nPisa 1940 carries more than 30 brands, ranging from the best-known to the relatively niche, over a wide spectrum of style and complexity. While the Italian customer had been the company’s main focus, today international customers outnumber the local, with most coming from Asia, the Middle East and North America.\n\nMaterial Good\n\nA relatively new establishment, Material Good was started 2015 by Rob Ronen and Michael Herman, with the aim of providing a most fetching environment for the purchase of fine jewelry and rare pre-owned watches. Ronen had worked for Audemars Piguet for many years, overseeing sales in North America, and his experience with luxury retailers during this time had impressed upon him that, “over and over again, the shopping experience wasn’t as elegant or luxurious as the products.”\n\nWith this in mind, the Material Good flagship store located within the central part of SoHo New York is an artfully curated living space, complete with full kitchen and bar, that is in fact a showroom offering fine and custom jewelry, as well as pre-owned and vintage watches with an emphasis on Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe, Rolex and Richard Mille. Watch offerings are supplemented by a procurement department headed by Yoni Ben-Yehuda, head of watches, which is tasked with sourcing rare pieces for customers with particular requirements.\n\nChalouhi has also expanded the business by branching overseas, with a boutique and Audemars Piguet store in London, and two mono-brand stores in Monaco for Audemars Piguet and Roger Dubuis respectively. To serve customers better, each shop has its own workshop, offering a range of after-sales and support services ranging from maintenance advice and verification to complex repairs and overhauls, for latest models as well as vintage pieces.\n\nFor jewelry customers, Arije also boasts a design studio to handhold customers through custom jewelry design and fabrication.\n\nHeurgon Horloger & Joaillier\n\nLocated in the vicinity of the elegant Madeleine district and the Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris, Heurgon Horloger & Joaillier is right at home amongst the luxury boutiques, high-end food stores, cultural landmarks and charming architecture. As it should, since it claims to have operated continuously from its 15 Rue Royale address since 1865, before moving to its present location a few minutes’ walk away at 58 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.\n\nPurchases can be made on-site at the physical store, or online through its website. Watch brands available include Bulgari, Blancpain, Chopard, Franck Muller, Grand Seiko, Arnold & Son and Ulysse Nardin."
