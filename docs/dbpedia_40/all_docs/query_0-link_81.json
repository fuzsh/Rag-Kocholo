So when he talks, I listen to\n\nhim. When asked during my Geneva Watch Days\n\nsymposium on âThe Watch Industryâs Greatest\n\nBrand Buildersâ about who has inspired him, he\n\nreplied, âEvery single CEO of Rolex that has ever\n\nlived, including Jean-FrÃ©dÃ©ric Dufour.â And I am\n\n1,000 percent in agreement. Just to demonstrate\n\nhow aware everyone in the watch industry is of\n\nthis, when I asked my friend Rexhep Rexhepi, the\n\nbiggest breakout star of independent watchmaking,\n\nif he agreed with Kern, he replied, âAbsolutely,\n\nwithout a doubt, he is right.â\n\nThatâs because every other brand in existence,\n\nfrom the smallest independent artisan to the\n\nbiggest semi-industrial colossus, owes its existence\n\nto Rolex. It is the culture of watch collecting\n\ncreated by Rolex that has provided the foundation\n\nthat this entire industry is built on. And if you\n\narenât aware of this, get ready to be reminded\n\nbecause Rolex is about to increase its already\n\ntitanic 29.2 percent market share (or 30.9 percent\n\nincluding its sister brand Tudor) of the luxury\n\nSwiss watch industry. But for the company, itâs not\n\nsimply about increasing its 9.3 billion Swiss franc\n\nannual revenue as indicated by my buddy Oliver\n\nMÃ¼llerâs Morgan Stanley report on Swiss watches.\n\nHe explained, âIncidentally, thatâs at wholesale; at\n\nthe retail level, its turnover is closer to 14 billion\n\nSwiss francs, which means each year Rolex gives\n\naway 5 billion Swiss francs in profit to its partners.â\n\nWait, did he really mean give away? Yes,\n\nabsolutely. Because for every one of the millionplus Rolex watches created annually, there is\n\nalready a willing buyer (probably 10 willing\n\nbuyers). This means that, as industry legend\n\nDanny Govberg put it, âretailers are simply acting\n\nlike delivery agents.â The question is, have they\n\ndone this job well? The answer is both yes and no.\n\nThere are amazing retailers like Singaporeâs The\n\nHour Glass and the U.A.E.âs Ahmed Seddiqi &\n\nSons who push themselves to achieve excellence.\n\nSaid Michael Tay, group managing director of The\n\nHour Glass, âI recognize that there is a price for\n\npartnership and I ensure that my team is always\n\ncommitted to paying this, which includes zero\n\ntolerance for any allocation of watches to resellers.â\n\nThe last two years have been so heated that for\n\nmany watches including Rolex and others, Tay now\n\nrequires potential clients to submit their personal\n\ninformation so they can be vetted to ensure they are\n\nnot profiteers. He said, âYes, it takes more effort,\n\nbut thatâs what I mean by demonstrating our longterm commitment to protecting ourÂ partners.â\n\nIn recent weeks, the big news in the industry\n\nhas been Rolexâs move to purchase Lucerne retail\n\njuggernaut Bucherer, which represented what\n\nindustry experts estimated to be 5 percent of their\n\nretail. I believe Rolexâs reasons for purchasing\n\nBucherer are twofold. On the one hand, Rolex\n\nwanted to ensure that Bucherer, with no heir\n\napparent, would remain intact. It is, after all,\n\na retailer with over 90 yearsâ history as a Rolex\n\npartner. Considering the importance of long-term\n\npartnerships for the mighty green giant, the idea\n\nof Bucherer being purchased by a venture capital\n\nor private equity firm would have been anathema\n\nto their goal of long-term stability.\n\nOn the other hand, owning Bucherer and\n\nundoubtedly incorporating some degree of Rolexâs\n\nlegendary regimented infrastructure offered\n\nanother opportunity. It offered them the possibility\n\nof reclaiming their own brand narrative, which over\n\nthe last two hype-market-driven years has been the\n\nfollowing: Most consumers that wanted to purchase\n\na Rolex at an authorized retailer were turned away\n\nand told that there were simply no watches. Yet\n\nevery single watch imaginable was available on the\n\nsecondary market at a premium. The practices of\n\nbundling and even right out baksheesh at the retail\n\nfloor had becomeÂ commonplace.\n\nFOUNDERËS\n\nNOTE\n\nP:19\n\nextend your international limited warranty\n\nfor up to 8 years on panerai.com\n\nSingapore - ION Orchard, #01-18, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, B1-93/94 - Tel: +65 3158 3496\n\nP:20\n\nWhile my friend Jean-Claude Biver always\n\ntold me, âdiscounting is the cancer of the watch\n\nindustry,â I would add that retail staff profiteering\n\nhas also become an equally toxic sickness within\n\nthe watch world. Such practices were open secrets\n\nand far too common. One individual that used to\n\nbe in charge of allocating the worldâs most soughtafter double stamped wristwatches was notorious\n\nfor accepting all forms of HermÃ¨s accessories and\n\neven first-class flights to aid the process of being\n\nselected. To me, clearly Rolex had had enough,\n\nand the idea of them owning the entire experience\n\nfrom beginning to end, including the primary\n\npurchasing experience, is also a clear message to\n\nall other retailers around the world to not f**k\n\naround. Because Rolex, certainly in Europe and\n\nAmerica where Bucherer is present, now simply\n\ndoesnât need you and wonât tolerate you corrupting\n\nthe end experience after theyâve gone through the\n\ninordinate effort to create the worldâs best watches\n\nand mightiest brand.\n\nRolex is also now starting to deliver more\n\nwatches. Many people have received phone calls\n\nfor watches that they had put themselves on the\n\nlist for. And that is a very good thing. Because over\n\nthe last two years, the only people more frustrated\n\nthan the customers who couldnât get any watches\n\nwere probably the good folks at Rolex. Because\n\nRolex watches were never meant to be impossible\n\nto get. Yes, healthy delta between supply and\n\ndemand is important and ensures that secondary\n\nvalues are high, which has become immeasurably\n\nimportant to a brand. However, the insane scarcity\n\nof Rolexes was never part of the plan. And now\n\nRolex has managed to readjust so that it is able\n\nto deliver more watches but always at its level of\n\nflawlessÂ execution.\n\nNow this is not necessarily good news for the\n\nrest of the watch industry. Why? First, because the\n\nbursting of the hype bubble has seen secondary\n\nprices come back to earth to what I believe is a\n\nhealthy and realistic level. Market conditions\n\nhave cooled and gone is the insane avarice for all\n\nforms of ticking horology. If you look back at every\n\nmarket downturn and economic crisis, one thing\n\nalways happens. Rolex and Patek Philippe always\n\ngain market share. When times are uncertain,\n\nconsumers retreat to the most known and stable\n\nentities such as Rolex. Second, because Rolex may\n\nor may not have strategically used this moment to\n\nstart delivering more watches, all the brands that\n\nwere benefitting from the fact that you couldnât\n\nget a Rolex (or the other market leaders like Patek\n\nPhilippe, Audemars Piguet or Richard Mille) are\n\ngoing to suffer. When given a choice between a\n\nRolex and brand X, a customer will always choose\n\na Rolex especially when times are uncertain.\n\nAnd that is the last thing I want to talk about\n\nhere. Yes, times are about to get tough. But if you\n\nthink about it, the last two years were an anomaly.\n\nIn fact, the modern history of the watch industry\n\nrelates to us responding to one crisis or another.\n\nAs my friend the brilliant CEO of Cartier, Cyrille\n\nVigneron, says, âThe only certainty is uncertainty.\n\nThe best way to protect against this is ensuring that\n\nyour brand has singularity and durability.â And\n\nheâs right. But the last thing I will say is this: In\n\ntough times, the best solution is to build strong\n\nand meaningful partnerships. Partnerships with\n\nthe best retailers for sure â because no one can\n\nbuild your brand with their client base better\n\nthan a great retailer â and partnerships with\n\nresponsible, passionate media thatâs driven to\n\nachieve excellence.\n\nWei Koh, Founder\n\nâwei_koh_revolution\n\nâIN TOUGH TIMES,\n\nTHE BEST SOLUTION\n\nIS TO BUILD STRONG\n\nAND MEANINGFUL\n\nPARTNERSHIPS.â\n\nP:21\n\nÂ© Disney\n\nP:22\n\nEDITORâS\n\nNOTE\n\nWatch fairs used to be these once-a-year big\n\nevents with everyone from retailers to\n\njournalists congregating in Switzerland\n\nensconced in oversized winter coats,\n\nviewing and reviewing novelties from all brands large and\n\nsmall, and generally waiving their rights to proper meals\n\nand adequate sleep. As such, the luxury watch calendar\n\nconsisted primarily of one major launch in the spring, with\n\nthe remaining months ahead spent delivering the promised\n\nwatches to customers in the various key markets.

But thatâs a subject for next yearâs issue.\n\nCeline Yap, Group Editor-in-Chief\n\n[email protected]\n\nP:23\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nGROUP EDITOR-IN-CHIEF\n\nCeline Yap [email protected]\n\nEDITORS-AT-LARGE\n\nCheryl Chia [email protected]\n\nEleonor Picciotto [email protected]\n\nSUB-EDITOR\n\nCatherine Koh [email protected]\n\nNEWS EDITOR\n\nKatherine Arteche [email protected]\n\nDIGITAL EDITOR\n\nFelix Scholz [email protected]\n\nDIGITAL WRITER\n\nSheng Lee [email protected]\n\nCONTENT & COMMUNITY MANAGER\n\nConstant Kwong [email protected]\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER\n\nEumund Tan [email protected]\n\nEDITORIAL COORDINATORS\n\nPunam Nikki Rai [email protected]\n\nCatherine Chang [email protected]\n\nINTERNATIONAL EDITIONS\n\nAUSTRALIA Felix Scholz\n\nITALY Maurizio Favot\n\nMEXICO Israel Ortega\n\nLATIN AMERICA Israel Ortega\n\nUSA Bhanu Chopra\n\nVISUAL\n\nART DIRECTOR\n\nJerald Ang [email protected]\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGNERS\n\nWynne Calista [email protected]\n\nSiti Maisarah Nasir [email protected]\n\nHEAD OF STUDIO\n\nKH Koh\n\nHEAD OF VIDEOGRAPHY\n\nSylvest Low\n\nPHOTOGRAPHER\n\nDerek Kwee\n\nCONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER\n\nMunster [email protected]\n\nJUNIOR VIDEO EDITORS\n\nMuhammad Hafiz Bin Abdul Aziz\n\nDavid Wang\n\nEditorial enquiries should be directed to the Editor.\n\nWhile every reasonable care will be undertaken by the\n\nEditor, unsolicited materials will not be returned unless\n\naccompanied by a self-addressed envelope and sufficient\n\nreturn postage.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nFOUNDER & CEO\n\nWei âKoh @wei_koh_revolution\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\n\nMaria Lim [email protected]\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\nDavid Ong [email protected]\n\nFINANCE MANAGER\n\nMaggie Cai [email protected]\n\nSALES & ADMIN\n\nDIRECTOR, ECOMMERCE & OPERATIONS\n\nDavid Sum [email protected]\n\nASSISTANT MANAGER, ECOMMERCE & OPERATIONS\n\nShazlina Binte Abdul Shukor [email protected]\n\nHUMAN RESOURCE MANAGER\n\nYvonne Koh [email protected]\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC COORDINATOR\n\nChristina Koh [email protected]\n\nREVHLUTION is published quarterly by\n\nRevolution Media Pte Ltd.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Specifically, the Planet Ocean Deep\n\nBlack ETNZ draws its design inspiration from the emblem of\n\nEmirates Team New Zealand, the defending champion, which\n\nhas been sponsored by the Swiss watchmaker since 1995.\n\nThe ETNZ Edition stands out prominently due to its\n\nconstruction and palette. It is crafted entirely from black\n\nceramic, including the case, bezel, dial, buckle and even the\n\ncaseback, making it one of the few all-ceramic watches on\n\nthe market. Notably, the black ceramic creates a striking\n\ncontrast with vibrant turquoise accents on the dial. This\n\ncontrast greatly improves readability, a crucial feature for a\n\nchronograph designed for sporting events.\n\nBesides its practicality, the new design is remarkably\n\nattractive. Omegaâs Planet Ocean series consistently features\n\na contemporary look, with modern typography and a clean,\n\neye-catching design. The two-tone black and turquoise\n\nstyling perfectly complements this modern design, further\n\nenhancing its futuristic aesthetic.\n\nNotably, the all-black design creates an optical illusion,\n\nmaking the watch appear smaller than its substantial\n\ndimensions of 45.5mm in width. Fortunately, the choice of\n\nceramic makes it lightweight and comfortable on the wrist.\n\nThese details should enhance the watchâs accessibility for\n\npeople with smaller wrists yet seeking a timepiece with a\n\nsporty and majestic presence.\n\nInside the watch is the caliber 9900, Omegaâs flagship\n\nautomatic chronograph movement with a vertical clutch and\n\na column wheel. And, of course, it is equipped with the CoAxial escapement as well as a silicon hairspring, which gives\n\nit 15,000 gauss of magnetism resistance. One interesting fact\n\nabout this movement is that it runs at 28,800 vibrations per\n\nhour or 4Hz, which differs from other Omega movements\n\nwith a silicon hairspring that run at 3.5Hz.\n\nAs a chronograph wristwatch designed for the Americaâs\n\nCup â and not many come to mind â the Planet Ocean\n\nDeep Black ETNZ Edition naturally comes equipped\n\nwith a regatta countdown function. Taking the form of a\n\nchronograph elapsed minutes at three oâclock, the regatta\n\ncountdown is essentially a regular elapsed minutes but with\n\nthe scale changed to countdown, specifically to be useful for\n\nthe 10-minute countdown to the raceâs start.\n\nSince the regatta countdown is the most crucial indicator\n\nof the chronograph, the entire minute scale has been painted\n\nin turquoise for maximum legibility. Furthermore, the usual\n\nco-axial chronograph hour hand has been replaced with\n\nan opening revealing a disk underneath that indicates the\n\nelapsed hours. This separation ensures that it doesnât interfere\n\nwith the countdown minute reading.\n\nOMEGA\n\nSEAMASTER PLANET OCEAN 600M CO-AXIAL MASTER\n\nCHRONOMETER DEEP BLACK ETNZ EDITION\n\nREFERENCE 215.92.46.51.01.003\n\nMOVEMENT Self-winding caliber 9900; 60-hour power\n\nreserve\n\nFUNCTIONS Hours, minutes, small seconds, chronograph\n\nand date\n\nCASE 45.5mm; black ceramic; water resistant to 600m\n\nDIAL Black with turquoise details; Super-LumiNova filled\n\nhour markers\n\nSTRAP Black rubber; ceramic folding clasp\n\nPRICE USD 13,300\n\nFEATURE 27\n\nAmidst the preliminary races for the 37th Americaâs\n\nCup, a warm-up event leading to the main\n\ncompetition in the summer of 2024, Omega as the\n\nofficial timekeeper has launched a special edition\n\nregatta chronograph.

Fortunately, the choice of\n\nceramic makes it lightweight and comfortable on the wrist.\n\nThese details should enhance the watchâs accessibility for\n\npeople with smaller wrists yet seeking a timepiece with a\n\nsporty and majestic presence.\n\nInside the watch is the caliber 9900, Omegaâs flagship\n\nautomatic chronograph movement with a vertical clutch and\n\na column wheel. And, of course, it is equipped with the CoAxial escapement as well as a silicon hairspring, which gives\n\nit 15,000 gauss of magnetism resistance. One interesting fact\n\nabout this movement is that it runs at 28,800 vibrations per\n\nhour or 4Hz, which differs from other Omega movements\n\nwith a silicon hairspring that run at 3.5Hz.\n\nAs a chronograph wristwatch designed for the Americaâs\n\nCup â and not many come to mind â the Planet Ocean\n\nDeep Black ETNZ Edition naturally comes equipped\n\nwith a regatta countdown function. Taking the form of a\n\nchronograph elapsed minutes at three oâclock, the regatta\n\ncountdown is essentially a regular elapsed minutes but with\n\nthe scale changed to countdown, specifically to be useful for\n\nthe 10-minute countdown to the raceâs start.\n\nSince the regatta countdown is the most crucial indicator\n\nof the chronograph, the entire minute scale has been painted\n\nin turquoise for maximum legibility. Furthermore, the usual\n\nco-axial chronograph hour hand has been replaced with\n\nan opening revealing a disk underneath that indicates the\n\nelapsed hours. This separation ensures that it doesnât interfere\n\nwith the countdown minute reading.\n\nOMEGA\n\nSEAMASTER PLANET OCEAN 600M CO-AXIAL MASTER\n\nCHRONOMETER DEEP BLACK ETNZ EDITION\n\nREFERENCE 215.92.46.51.01.003\n\nMOVEMENT Self-winding caliber 9900; 60-hour power\n\nreserve\n\nFUNCTIONS Hours, minutes, small seconds, chronograph\n\nand date\n\nCASE 45.5mm; black ceramic; water resistant to 600m\n\nDIAL Black with turquoise details; Super-LumiNova filled\n\nhour markers\n\nSTRAP Black rubber; ceramic folding clasp\n\nPRICE USD 13,300\n\nFEATURE 27\n\nP:30\n\nPatek Philippe chronographs go a long way back.\n\nDuring the time when the company progressed into\n\nthe wristwatch era, its first wrist-worn timekeeper\n\nintroduced in 1923 was already a heavy hitter: a\n\ncustom ordered split seconds chronograph known as No. 124\n\n824.

It shows Jaeger-LeCoultreâs willingness to\n\nestablish a new visual identity shared across collections and,\n\nwhile it seems like a small thing, the ability to carve out a\n\nchromatic niche for such a well-known brand, should not\n\nbe underestimated.\n\nRather than having a single model sporting a new\n\naesthetic, the brand is developing a visual language that\n\ncould, if this path is pursued further, have watch lovers and\n\nanalysts alike commenting that anything that looks like it,\n\nlooks like a Jaeger-LeCoultre imitation. To do that with color\n\nis not straightforward, and it enthuses me personally to see\n\nJaeger-LeCoultre attempting it with so much success so far.\n\nThe crux of pulling off such a move is to do several little\n\nthings well at once. To be seen as special and identifiable,\n\nthe brand must mix elements of tradition with elements of\n\nfuturism (or at least cutting-edge modernity) and do so in a\n\nway that is not uncomfortably jarring to the eye. In the case\n\nof these 42mm Polaris Chronographs, pairing a warm gray\n\ndial and a deep blue fumÃ© lacquer dial with either black or\n\ndeep blue sub-dials, fearlessly accented by a splash of red/\n\norange repeated on the tip of the seconds hand, lends a gritty\n\ndynamism to an otherwise classical dial finish.\n\nThe size of these chronographs is near-optimum for\n\ntrue-to-size wearability. While the 13.39mm thickness is,\n\nwhen matched with a 42mm diameter (and 48.5 mm lugto-lug), marginally thicker than ideal, the sprawling dial\n\nand ultra-thin bezel will give the impression of the watch\n\nsitting closer to the wrist than its raw specs might suggest.\n\nThe âdouble fumÃ©â design, which sees both the outer ring of\n\nthe central dial and the central portion gradating toward\n\ntheir respective edges tricks the eye into believing the dial\n\nelements are migrating outward. Again, this helps with the\n\noverall visual impact of the watch and makes it feel as if\n\nthe watch is falling towards the wrist rather than fighting\n\nagainst its steel frame. While some may lament the absence\n\nof a steel bracelet option for the warm gray dial, I would pick\n\nthe warm gray on its beige canvas strap over the other three\n\navailableÂ combinations.\n\nNot only does this feel the most âready for actionâ to me,\n\nbut it also continues the softer colorway all the way around\n\nthe wrist. The blue dial on the steel bracelet will be a must\n\nfor many, but when it comes to originality and the stricter\n\nadherence to the conceived design code, the gray and beige\n\nwork exceptionally well together in my opinion. The warm\n\ngray dial is at once strikingly bright and breathtakingly\n\nserene. In an era in which we demand a lot of versatility from\n\nour watches, I believe this model scores highly in that regard.\n\nIt can be dressed up or down with ease, and the quick change\n\nblack rubber strap (included with both dial options) means\n\nthis piece can go from daytime to dinner in a heartbeat.\n\nJaeger-LeCoultreâs very own Caliber 761 derives its power\n\nfrom an oscillating mass charged with winding two barrels.\n\nThis fully integrated column-wheel chronograph continues\n\nJaeger-LeCoultreâs long-held reputation as one of the finest\n\nmovement producers the industry has in its ranks and is a\n\njoy to see through the sapphire display case back that reveals\n\nit and its elegant finishing in all its glory. An evolution\n\nof the 751, this caliber adds a running seconds hand at 9\n\noâclock â a feature absent in its predecessor (replacing the\n\n12-hour counter that had previously occupied the same spot).\n\nFurthermore, in light of this new feature, a hacking seconds\n\nfeature has been added.\n\nUltimately, this watch is a welcome addition to a\n\ncollection that continues to build on the 1960s legacy of this\n\nmodel family. With a solid core offering established, expect\n\nthe gloves to come off as Jaeger-LeCoultre looks to push the\n\nPolaris in evermore exciting directions.\n\nFEATURE 37\n\nT\n\nhe Polaris was always regarded as a classic.

To be seen as special and identifiable,\n\nthe brand must mix elements of tradition with elements of\n\nfuturism (or at least cutting-edge modernity) and do so in a\n\nway that is not uncomfortably jarring to the eye. In the case\n\nof these 42mm Polaris Chronographs, pairing a warm gray\n\ndial and a deep blue fumÃ© lacquer dial with either black or\n\ndeep blue sub-dials, fearlessly accented by a splash of red/\n\norange repeated on the tip of the seconds hand, lends a gritty\n\ndynamism to an otherwise classical dial finish.\n\nThe size of these chronographs is near-optimum for\n\ntrue-to-size wearability. While the 13.39mm thickness is,\n\nwhen matched with a 42mm diameter (and 48.5 mm lugto-lug), marginally thicker than ideal, the sprawling dial\n\nand ultra-thin bezel will give the impression of the watch\n\nsitting closer to the wrist than its raw specs might suggest.\n\nThe âdouble fumÃ©â design, which sees both the outer ring of\n\nthe central dial and the central portion gradating toward\n\ntheir respective edges tricks the eye into believing the dial\n\nelements are migrating outward. Again, this helps with the\n\noverall visual impact of the watch and makes it feel as if\n\nthe watch is falling towards the wrist rather than fighting\n\nagainst its steel frame. While some may lament the absence\n\nof a steel bracelet option for the warm gray dial, I would pick\n\nthe warm gray on its beige canvas strap over the other three\n\navailableÂ combinations.\n\nNot only does this feel the most âready for actionâ to me,\n\nbut it also continues the softer colorway all the way around\n\nthe wrist. The blue dial on the steel bracelet will be a must\n\nfor many, but when it comes to originality and the stricter\n\nadherence to the conceived design code, the gray and beige\n\nwork exceptionally well together in my opinion. The warm\n\ngray dial is at once strikingly bright and breathtakingly\n\nserene. In an era in which we demand a lot of versatility from\n\nour watches, I believe this model scores highly in that regard.\n\nIt can be dressed up or down with ease, and the quick change\n\nblack rubber strap (included with both dial options) means\n\nthis piece can go from daytime to dinner in a heartbeat.\n\nJaeger-LeCoultreâs very own Caliber 761 derives its power\n\nfrom an oscillating mass charged with winding two barrels.\n\nThis fully integrated column-wheel chronograph continues\n\nJaeger-LeCoultreâs long-held reputation as one of the finest\n\nmovement producers the industry has in its ranks and is a\n\njoy to see through the sapphire display case back that reveals\n\nit and its elegant finishing in all its glory. An evolution\n\nof the 751, this caliber adds a running seconds hand at 9\n\noâclock â a feature absent in its predecessor (replacing the\n\n12-hour counter that had previously occupied the same spot).\n\nFurthermore, in light of this new feature, a hacking seconds\n\nfeature has been added.\n\nUltimately, this watch is a welcome addition to a\n\ncollection that continues to build on the 1960s legacy of this\n\nmodel family. With a solid core offering established, expect\n\nthe gloves to come off as Jaeger-LeCoultre looks to push the\n\nPolaris in evermore exciting directions.\n\nFEATURE 37\n\nP:40\n\nTOP FIVE INNOVATIONS\n\nIN TIMING WATCHES\n\nFrom Audemars Piguet to Zenith, here are the five most\n\ngroundbreaking chronographs in modern watchmaking.\n\nWORDS CHERYL CHIA\n\nI\n\nn the past two decades, the field of chronographs\n\nhas witnessed a multitude of innovations. These\n\nadvancements have spanned from completely\n\nreimagining traditional chronograph design to\n\ntackling the fundamental challenge that has long haunted\n\nthem, such as the erratic seconds hand movement. As we\n\nforge ahead in a perpetual quest for precision mechanics,\n\nwe look back at chronographs that have boldly pushed\n\nthe boundaries of what this timekeeping instrument\n\ncan do. While some have faded from the present, they\n\nhave left an indelible mark on history and are excellent\n\nexamples of a brand pushing beyond the ambit of their\n\ncore business and breaking new ground for the purpose of\n\nenhancing functionality.\n\nAUDEMARS PIGUET ROYAL OAK CONCEPT LAPTIMER\n\nMICHAEL SCHUMACHER\n\nThe Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Concept Laptimer Michael\n\nSch"
