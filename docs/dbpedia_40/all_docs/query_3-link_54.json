        "text": "A sedimentary archive was collected from Lake Ring in November 2016 with a gravity corer; the core was sliced in 34 layers of 0.5 cm, which corresponded to a temporal resolution of about 3 years per layer across 100 years. This estimate was based on a radiometric chronology of the core completed in 2018 (see Materials and methods). Lake Ring has a well-known and documented history of human impact over the past century. The lake transitioned over time from a semi-pristine environment to eutrophication, and later to high pesticide pollution due to intensification of agricultural land-use in the area surrounding the lake. In modern times (>1999), the lake partially recovered (see Materials and methods for more details) (Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b). Hereafter, we refer to the lake transitions across these statuses as lake phases.\n\nWe quantified community-level biodiversity over a century (1916–2016) by applying high-throughput multilocus metabarcoding (18S, 16SV1, 16SV4, COI and rbcL barcodes) to bulk environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from layers of a dated sedimentary archive from Lake Ring. After denoising, the number of unique ASVs and total number of reads across all samples (including median number of reads per sample) found per barcode were as follows: 18S - 2,023 ASVs, 569,761 total reads (median 12,893 reads); 16SV1 - 4,022 ASVs, 842,619 total reads (median 20,798 reads); 16SV4 - 5,270 ASVs, 552,064 total reads (median 13,816 reads); COI - 822 ASVs, 362,616 total reads (median 9,595 reads); rbcL - 417 ASVs, 366,489 total reads (median 9,443 reads). Alpha diversity did not significantly vary across the lake phases for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Appendix 1—figure 1) and was proportionally higher in the prokaryotic (16 S barcodes) than in the eukaryotic community (18S barcode). Conversely, the invertebrate community (COI barcode), and the diatom community (rbcL barcode), showed significant changes over time across the lake phases, reflecting taxon-specific patterns over time (Appendix 1—figure 1). Even though the alpha diversity varied over time, it was not consistently lower in historical than modern communities across the barcodes, allowing us to exclude bias in the preservation state of environmental DNA.\n\nThe community composition (beta diversity) changed significantly in the transition between lake phases (Table 1; Figure 2A; Appendix 1—figure 2). The overall eukaryotic community composition changed over time across all lake phases (Table 1; Figure 2A; 18S). However, the composition of the primary producers (e.g. rbcL) changed significantly only in the transition between the pesticide and the eutrophic phases, whereas the invertebrate’s community (e.g. COI) changed significantly only between the pesticide and the recovery phases (Table 1; Figure 2A; rbcL, COI). The significant changes in community composition identified by the PERMANOVA analysis were driven by two families of primary producers [Chlorophyceae (green algae), Mediophyceae (diatoms)] and seven families of invertebrates, [Monhysterida (nematode worms), Oligohymenophorea (ciliates), Calanoida (zooplankton), Ploimida (rotifers), Chaetonotida (gastrotrichs), Thoracosphaeraceae (dinoflagellates) and Calanoida (copepods)] (Figure 2B; 18S). In the transition from the semi-pristine to the eutrophic phase, the relative abundance of rotifers and green algae declined in favour of calanoids and diatoms, respectively (Figure 2B; 18S). The proportion of diatoms, worms and nematodes increased in the transition from the eutrophic to the pesticide phase, while the proportion of calanoids and gastrotricha declined (Figure 2B; 18S). The taxonomic composition of the recovery phase showed a relative increase in ciliates and gastrotricha as compared to the pesticide environment (Figure 2B; 18S). Vampirellidae (Vampire amoebae feeding on algae) were relatively more abundant in the eutrophic than in the other phases, in which primary producers were also more abundant (Figure 2B, 18S). The composition of the recovery and semi-pristine phases differed significantly, suggesting an incomplete recovery of the lake over time to this date (Table 1; Figure 2A;18S).\n\nTable 1\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe prokaryotic community significantly changed at each major transition between lake phases, consistently across the two barcodes (Table 1; 16SV1 and 16SV4). We observed two patterns in the prokaryotic community composition over time: some taxonomic groups changed with the redox status of the sediment (e.g. acidophilus archaea [Thermoplasmata] and methanogenic archaea [Methanomassiliicoccaceae], which declined from the semi-pristine to the recovery phase [Figure 2B, 16SV4]); others changed over time consistently with the nutrient levels of the ecosystem. For example Nitrospiraceae (nitrite oxidizers) were more abundant in high-nutrient environments (eutrophic and pesticides) than in lower nutrient environments (semi-pristine and recovery) (Figure 2B; 16SV1).\n\nChanges in the invertebrate community were driven by Brachionideae (rotifers) that were most abundant in the semi-pristine phase and declined over time; Chironomidae (lake flies) that were proportionally more abundant in the eutrophic and recovery phases and showed the lowest abundance in the pesticides phase; Chaoboridae (phantom midge larvae) that were only present in the semi-pristine and recovery phases; and Daphniidae (waterfleas) that were most abundant in the pesticide phase, but present throughout the 100 years of sampling (Figure 2B; COI). The diatom composition was stable over time, with only the semi-pristine phase having a more distinctive diatom assemblage profile dominated by Bacillariophyta (Figure 2B; rbcL). Diatoms are commonly used by regulators to derive the status of freshwater within the Water Framework Directive both for lakes and rivers (Agency, 2020). We used our rbcL data to derive a Lake Trophic Diatom Index (LTDI2) for Lake Ring following Bennion et al., 2014. This result confirmed our beta diversity analysis of non-significant changes over time of the diatom community (Appendix 1—figure 3).\n\nTo discover drivers of biodiversity change we applied sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to community biodiversity data and other parameters measured from Lake Ring, namely climate records collected from a weather station proximal to the lake, and sales records of biocides in Denmark between 1955 and 2015 from the Danish national archives. The biocide sales records proved to be a good representation of persistent chemicals in the lake sediment, as the quantification of the persistent halogenated pesticide DDT in the sliced sedimentary archive showed, by producing a very similar profile as the sales records over time (see methods section).\n\nWe discovered that insecticides and fungicides best explained changes in overall biodiversity, possessing the highest CCA loadings across the barcodes, followed by pesticides and herbicides (Supplementary file 1A). Among the climate variables, yearly minimum temperature explained the largest biodiversity changes, whereas other climate variables had a variable impact across the barcodes and hence taxonomic groups (Supplementary file 1B).\n\nHaving ranked biocides and climate variables that best explained changes in overall biodiversity, we identified correlations between taxonomic groups (assigned at family level where possible) and individual abiotic variables. Correlations were identified between a total of 44 eukaryotic (18S, COI and rbcL) families and abiotic variables; of these correlations, 32 were with biocides and 33 with climate variables (some correlations involved the same taxonomic group correlating with multiple environmental factors). Of the 32 families negatively correlated with biocides, the largest proportion co-varied significantly with insecticides (22 families - 69%) and fungicides (16 families - 50%), followed by herbicides (9 families - 28%) and pesticides (3 families - 9%) (Supplementary file 2). Of the 33 families correlated with climate variables, the largest proportion co-varied with summer precipitation (14 families - 42%); of these, 9 families were positively correlated and 5 were negatively correlated with summer precipitation. The next three highest proportions of families which co-varied with climate variables were summer atmospheric pressure (10 families - 30%; 7 positive and 3 negative correlations), mean minimum temperature (9 families – 27%; 6 positive and 3 negative correlations) and highest recorded temperature (8 families – 24%; 7 positive and 1 negative correlations) (Supplementary file 2).\n\nThe number of unique prokaryote families significantly negatively correlated with biocides was 99, 19 of which were identified by both 16 S barcodes. Following from the sCCA analysis, significant negative correlations were observed between 60 (60.6%) families and insecticides, followed by 59 families and fungicides (59.6%), 40 families and herbicides (40.4%), and 25 families and pesticides (25.3%) (Supplementary file 2; overall). A total of 105 non-redundant correlations were identified between prokaryotic families and climate variables, 6 of which were found in both 16 S barcodes. Of the total families correlating with climate variables, 69 (65.7%) significantly correlated with mean minimum temperature. Of these, 38 were positive and 31 were negative correlations. Thirty-five families (33.3%) significantly correlated with summer precipitation; of these, 11 were positively and 23 were negatively correlated. Twenty-nine families (27.6%) significantly correlated with the lowest recorded temperature; of these 20 were positive and 9 were negative correlations. Twenty-six families (24.8%) significantly correlated with mean summer temperature; of these 13 were positively and 13 negatively correlated. Twenty-three families (21.9%) significantly correlated with maximum daily precipitation; of these, 3 were positively and 20 were negatively correlated. Eleven families (10.4%) significantly correlated with highest recorded temperature; of these 3 were positively and 8 were negatively correlated (Supplementary file 2).\n\nWe applied sCCA to identify families that correlated both with climate variables and biocides (Figure 4). As biocides were introduced only in 1960, only the most recent three lake phases were included in this analysis. The eukaryotic biodiversity compositional change was predominantly explained by biocides (Figure 4; 18S; Biocides: 44%), followed by climate variables (Figure 4; 18S; climate variables: 22%). Up to 22% of the diatoms compositional change was explained by biocides (44%) and climate variables (36%). However, the abiotic variables only separated the recovery from the other two lake phases (Figure 4), supporting significant biodiversity compositional shifts observed in the beta diversity analysis (Figure 2A; Table 1). Similarly, the invertebrate community compositional changes were explained prevalently by biocides (47%), followed by climate variables (30%), which only separated the recovery phase from the other two lake phases. Climate and biocides almost equally explained up to 36% of the prokaryote biodiversity compositional change across the lake phases (16SV1 - biocides: 44%, climate variables 47%; 16SV4 - biocides 45%, climate variable 38%). Following from this analysis, joint effects of biocides and climate variables were observed for 23 prokaryotic (16 S) and two eukaryotic (18S) families (Figure 5A), whereas no joint effects were identified on the diatom (rbcL) and the invertebrate (COI) communities (Figure 5A; Supplementary file 3). The most frequent joint effects on prokaryotes were from insecticides and mean minimum temperature combined (Figure 5A; Supplementary file 3). Joint effects between herbicides and maximum daily precipitation or between herbicides and lowest recorded temperature were rare (Figure 5A; Supplementary file 3). The joint effects on the eukaryotic community were observed between insecticides and summer precipitation (Figure 5A; Supplementary file 3).\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 5\n\nThe biocide types showing joint effects with environmental variables were ranked based on their correlation coefficient over time (Supplementary file 3). The top ranked insecticides most frequently showing these joint effects with climate variables and an adverse effect on both prokaryotes and eukaryotes were: oxydemeton-methyl (organothiophosphate insecticide, primarily used to control aphids, mites, and thrips), mevinphos (organophosphate insecticide used to control insects in a wide range of crops) and dicofol (organochlorine acaricide chemically related to DDT). Additionally, parathion (organophosphate insecticide and acaricide), carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate used chiefly as an insecticide), dieldrin (organochlorine insecticide, developed in alternative to DDT) and thiometon (organic thiophosphate insecticide) showed adverse effects with only the prokaryotic community. Examples of joint effects on specific families are shown in Figure 5B and C. The temporal dynamics of Isochrysidales, a coccolith-producing microalgae, was affected by the joint effect of summer precipitation and insecticides (Figure 5B), whereas the temporal dynamics of the PeM15 group of Actinobacteria was affected by the joint effect of insecticides and mean minimum temperature (Figure 5C).\n\nState-of-the-art paleoecological monitoring typically uses direct observations (light microscopy) of species remains to assess the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems. These approaches are low throughput and require specialist skills (Moraitis et al., 2019). Direct observations are inherently biased towards species that leave fossil remains; species identification is strongly reliant on well-preserved remains in environmental matrices; and cryptic species diversity cannot be resolved (Hirai et al., 2017). Recently, automated acquisition of microfossil data using artificial intelligence has been proposed as an alternative to human inspection for reconstructing long-term biological changes (Itaki et al., 2020). However, this approach relies on the completeness of reference databases and of the fossil remains, suffering from the same limitations of direct observations minus the low throughput aspects. Efforts to catalogue temporal changes in biodiversity have recently started to understand changes in species richness and assemblages in different geographic regions of the globe (Blowes et al., 2019). These efforts are important to understand the extent of overall biodiversity loss. However, there are only a handful of existing datasets that span more than 50 years and many of the multidecal biodiversity time series are limited to terrestrial and marine ecosystem, with freshwater ecosystems being marginally represented (Blowes et al., 2019). Moreover, long-term freshwater studies tend to focus on indicator species or specific taxonomic groups (e.g. invertebrates), rather than capturing community-level patterns (Dornelas et al., 2018). Developments in the field of sedaDNA have addressed the limitations of direct observations, utilising the properties of eDNA (Capo et al., 2019). However, sedaDNA studies have predominantly focused on microorganisms as proxies for ecosystems’ health [e.g. cyanobacteria (Picard et al., 2022); ciliates (Barouillet et al., 2022); parasitic taxa (Talas et al., 2021)], with other taxonomic groups less well represented. Our study addresses some of the challenges of direct observations as it is not reliant on fossil remains. However, the completeness of the community taxonomic assignment depends on the completeness of reference databases. We acknowledge that our taxonomic classification may be incomplete.\n\nWhereas the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies requires training, these technologies are well established with publicly available standard operating procedures. As compared to direct observations, high-throughput sequencing provides replicable results regardless of the operator. Moreover, the application of metabarcoding to sedaDNA or more generally eDNA can be outsourced to established environmental services, removing the need for training if it is a limiting factor.\n\nStudies of temporal dynamics typically start from an already shifted baseline and rely on discrete observations (Barouillet et al., 2022). Our study alleviates these limitations by providing a continuous community-level analysis of biological changes over recent evolutionary times and starting from a relatively undisturbed environment. However, eDNA-based studies suffer from limitations linked to the level of preservation of nucleotides in environmental matrices. Although it has been shown that DNA can be recovered from lacustrine and marine sediments as far back as the Holocene (Slon et al., 2022), biases might still exist due to the degradation of eDNA, especially over geological times (Jia et al., 2022) and in warmer climates (Mauvisseau et al., 2022). In addition, physio-chemical changes in sediment and soil may affect the assemblage and composition of prokaryotic communities that can survive in extreme conditions, including anoxic environments. However, it has been shown that slightly alkaline water (pH 7–9) facilitates DNA preservation (Jia et al., 2022). Whereas we cannot exclude that the eDNA in our study suffers from some of the mentioned biases, we expect DNA degradation not to have affected our study significantly. This is because we observed non-significant difference in species richness over time in both the prokaryotic (16 S barcode) and eukaryotic (18S barcode) communities. DNA degradation would have resulted in lower alpha diversity with increasing age of the sediment. Preservation of DNA in our study is also favoured by the time frame studied (100 years as opposed to millennia), the stable pH since the 1960s (data prior to 1960s were not recorded), and the latitude of Lake Ring which experiences average yearly temperatures below 15℃. All these factors are known to reduce microbial activity, allowing a better preservation of DNA in sediment (Giguet-Covex et al., 2014).\n\nAlthough the overall species richness did not change significantly over time, species assemblages significantly changed over time. Non-significant changes in alpha diversity coupled with significant changes in beta diversity over time have been reported for existing time series of biodiversity data in marine and terrestrial environments, even if the length of the time series rarely exceeded four decades (Blowes et al., 2019).\n\nThreats to biodiversity pose a significant challenge because they change over time and may result in additive adverse effects (Bonebrake et al., 2019). Long-term continuous observations are preferable to short-term observations because they can reveal correlations and possible causation between biological changes and abiotic drivers of change (Gillson and Marchant, 2014). Using eDNA-based data on multitrophic biodiversity over the past 100 years, we identified the taxonomic groups within the prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities that significantly contributed to community assemblages shifts. Whereas the prokaryotic community was overall changing at each major transition between lake phases, changes in the eukaryotic community were driven by different taxonomic groups in the transition between lake phases. The diatom community, typically used by regulators as an indicator of freshwater ecological status, did not change significantly over time, as the beta diversity and the LTDI2 index revealed. These results strongly suggest that a system-level approach, like the one proposed here, may be more appropriate than species or taxon-specific approaches. Our approach showed that diatom communities are not a reliable representation of the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems and are not good indicators of environmental change. Our approach provides a major advantage over traditional direct observations by identifying both taxonomic and functional changes of freshwater biodiversity in a high-throughput fashion. The analysis of temporal trends of biodiversity from a semi-pristine baseline through impacted environments provides a new reference point for regulators to define biodiversity in semi-pristine conditions.\n\nEven if Lake Ring partially recovered from eutrophication and biocide pollution in modern times, both the contemporary eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities are significantly different from the semi-pristine historical community, as the PERMANOVA on beta diversity demonstrates. Our findings align with other studies using sedaDNA on decennial timeframes focusing on prokaryotes (e.g. cyanobacteria Cao et al., 2020), whereas studies on eukaryotic compositional changes are just emerging to enable quantitative comparative assessments (Zhang et al., 2021). Studies on prokaryotic and eukaryotic assemblages based on short experimental manipulations suggest that natural communities can return to their original state before a perturbation occurs (Hillebrand and Kunze, 2020). However, longer term experimental manipulations show a different perspective with irreversible changes in biodiversity composition and function (Fordham, 2015). These long(er)-term experimental manipulations and our study suggest that empirical observation of multi trophic changes over time in natural systems are critical to understand the context-dependency of biodiversity-environmental impact relationships and assess the resilience of natural ecosystems.\n\nChanges in community assemblages are important because they can be associated with changes in functional biodiversity. Although biodiversity variables include taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes, most studies have focused on generic taxonomic diversity measures – usually measured as species richness or abundance, ignoring functional biodiversity (Li et al., 2020). Biomass and changes in biomass only capture productivity, while disregarding other metrics, such as decomposition or resource turnover (Gounand et al., 2018). A complete assessment of biodiversity should include functionality (Eisenhauer et al., 2019). In particular, enzyme activities are relevant because they exhibit the functions encoded in genes and reflect the role of microbiota in the transfer of matter and energy from low to high trophic levels in ecosystems. Changes in biological assemblages over time and across lake phases in our study resulted in significant changes in functional biodiversity, observable through changes in metabolic, biosynthesis and degradation functions of the prokaryotic community demonstrated by differentially abundant KEGG pathways between lake phases. Catabolic functions, metabolism (including methane metabolism), degradation and biosynthesis were differentially enriched between the recovery and other lake phases. These are key functions for the survival of organisms. For example, change is metabolic potency and the ability to break down complex molecules into smaller ones (catabolism and degradation) may affect survival and fitness of living organisms by influencing the uptake of nutrients.\n\nPredicting the functional profiles of prokaryotic communities based on their taxonomic composition has its limitations. Predictions of functions linked to human gut microbes tend to be more accurate than predictions on other communities because reference databases are developed on currently available genomes, which are biased towards microorganisms associated with human health and biotechnology (Choi et al., 2017). Because of the bias in reference databases, functional predictions may be more accurate for basic metabolic and housekeeping functions (essential cellular functions that are evolutionary conserved), which are more commonly annotated (Mi et al., 2019). Therefore, it is possible that we underestimated the predicted changes in functional biodiversity driven by environmental change in our study. Yet, we were able to detect important functional changes (e.g. metabolism and biosynthesis essential for survival) in correspondence with major ecosystem shifts (e.g. from semi-pristine to recovery phase).\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies have documented impacts on biodiversity driven by climate change (Pecl et al., 2017), whereas chemicals are thought to pose a negligible threat to biodiversity because living organisms can adapt and evolve (Groh et al., 2022). Adaptation to environmental change can happen, but it comes at a cost that can reduce resilience of natural populations to multiple stressors or novel stress (Cuenca-Cambronero et al., 2021). Our study showed that chemicals and climate variables each explain up to 47% of biodiversity compositional changes and that the joint effect of insecticides/fungicides and yearly extreme temperature/summer precipitation best explained changes in overall biodiversity. The joint effects of insecticides and extreme temperature events affected prokaryotes by altering their functionality and changing their metabolic, biosynthesis and degradation functions. The joint effect of insecticides and summer precipitation best explained changes in primary producers and grazers. This result aligns with previous studies showing that the effect of chemicals on freshwater can be exacerbated by temperature/precipitation, because of changes in the bioavailability, adsorption, elimination and relative toxicity of chemicals by water organisms (Pinheiro et al., 2021). Higher temperatures increase diffusion of chemical molecules, resulting in faster uptake by living organisms and hence toxicity (Patra et al., 2015). In some cases, higher temperatures result in effects on the organism’s metabolic ability to reduce a chemical’s toxicity. Our study hints at examples of both mechanisms, distinguishing between families that are negatively and positively correlated with climate variables.\n\nThe resolution and reliability of our data-driven systemic approach goes beyond the current state-of-the-art, enabling us to identify the specific abiotic factors, down to the commercial name of biocides, that in isolation or combined with climate variables affected specific families of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Our algorithm provides a high degree of confidence that surpasses state-of-the-art analysis, which predominantly identify patterns of co-occurrence of taxa within communities e.g. Correlation-Centric Network approach (Yang et al., 2020). A step in the right direction to capture complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables is the network analysis of co-occurrence patterns among physico-chemical and biological variables using random forest machine learning algorithms (e.g. Tse et al., 2018). This approach is hypothesis-free and allows the identification of synchronicity between various environmental variables and sedaDNA sequence variation. However, even when applied to temporal trends, it does not quantify joint effects of environmental factors on biodiversity. So far, random forest machine learning algorithms have only been applied to prokaryotic communities, disregarding other taxonomic groups and providing a partial understanding of community-level patterns and responses (Tse et al., 2018).\n\nA potential limitation of our approach is that correlations identified in field surveys do not demonstrate causation. However, they generate testable hypotheses that can be proven experimentally in controlled mesocosm experiments as explained in Eastwood et al., 2022, providing a potentially transformative approach.\n\nLake Ring is a shallow mixed lake in Jutland, Denmark (55°57’51.83’’ N, 9°35’46.87’’ E) with a well-known history of human impact (Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b). A sedimentary archive was collected from Lake Ring in November 2016 with an HTH-type gravity corer; the core was sliced in 34 layers of 0.5 cm and stored in dark and cold (–20 °C) conditions. A radiometric chronology of this sediment was completed in 2018 by Goldsmith Ecology Ltd following standard protocols (Appleby, 2001), and provided an accurate dating of the sediment to the year 1916. According to this chronology the core covered 100 years at a resolution of ca. 3 years intervals. To reduce potential contamination when handling older sediment layers each layer of sediment was handled in a PCR-free and DNA-free environment. Dating of sediment was conducted by direct gamma assay, using ORTEC HPGe GWL series well-type coaxial low background intrinsic germanium detector. Sediment samples with known radionuclide profiles were used for calibration following Appleby, 2001.\n\nWe used, historical records, direct chemical analysis of sediment, and physico-chemical records to reconstruct the paleoecological environment of Lake Ring. According to historical records, the lake was semi-pristine until the 1940s. In the late 1950s, sewage inflow from a nearby town increased nutrient levels resulting in eutrophication. The sewage inflow was diverted at the end of the 1970s, but this period coincided with agricultural land-use intensification (>1980), causing biocides leaching into the lake. The lake partially recovered in modern times (>1999), experiencing a partial return to its original trophic state and reduced impact from biocides (Cuenca Cambronero et al., 2018b).\n\nPhysico-chemical variables were measured in the lake between 1970 and 2016, even though data are sparse and discontinuous, limiting their use in a machine learning or statistical framework. To complement the historical records, we obtained climate data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (Supplementary file 4). The climate data were collected from a weather station 80 km from Lake Ring. Air and water surface temperature typically have a positive correlation for shallow streams and lakes (Livingstone and Lotter, 1998; Preudhomme and Stefan, 1992). Hence, we used the data from the weather station as an estimate of the lake water temperature. We also observed a tight correlation between the recorded water temperature in Lake Ring and the summer air temperature recorded by the weather station. In addition, we procured sales records of biocides in Denmark between 1955 and 2015 from the Danish national archives (Supplementary file 4). To assess whether the biocide sales records were a good representation of persistent chemicals in the lake sediment, we quantified the persistent halogenated pesticide DDT in the sliced sedimentary archive of Lake Ring, applying gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis. Sediment samples were lyophilized and freeze dried in a lyophilizator using a Christ Beta 1–8 LSCplus freeze-dryer, (Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany), to avoid analyte loss during water removal. Following lyophilization, the sediment samples were sieved through 0.4 mm meshes and homogenised. Approximately 1 g of dry sediment was weighed into pre-cleaned glass tubes and spiked with 100 ng of deuterated [2H8- 4,4`- DDT], used as an internal (surrogate) standard, followed by 1 g of copper powder (Merck, Dorset, UK) for sulphur removal. The sediment samples were extracted using 5 ml of hexane: acetone (3:1 v/v), vortexed for 5 min, followed by ultrasonication for 15 min and centrifugation for 3 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a clean, dry tube and the process was repeated twice for each sample. The combined extract was then evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2 and reconstituted in 2 mL of hexane. Sulphuric acid (3 ml) was used to wash the reconstituted crude extract. The organic phase was allowed to separate on top of the acid layer then transferred to another clean dry test tube. The remaining acid layer was washed twice, each with 2 ml of Hexane. The combined clean extract and washes was evaporated under a gentle stream of Nitrogen, reconstituted into 150 µl of iso-octane containing 100 pg/µl of PCB 131 used as syringe (recovery) standard. Quantification of target DDTs was conducted on a TRACE 1310 GC coupled to an ISQ single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) operated in electron ionization (EI) mode according to a previously reported method (Wong et al., 2009).\n\nTo identify correlations between biological assemblages (families identified through the sedaDNA sequencing) and drivers of change, we focused on biocides and climate variables, using sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA; it can be thought of as consensus PCA on multiple data matrices) followed by Sliding Window (Pearson) Correlation (SWC) analysis (Appendix 1—figure 5). Physico-chemical variables were not used in this analysis because of their sparsity (data rarely met the Sliding Window correlation criteria of 5 continuous values) and low variation over time (Appendix 1—figure 4A). sCCA is a tool for integrating and discovering complex, group-wise patterns among high-dimensional datasets (Parkhomenko et al., 2009). While most forms of machine learning require large sample sizes, sCCA uses fewer observations to identify the most correlated components among data matrices and captures the multivariate variability of the most important features (Nakagawa and Cuthill, 2007).\n\nMatrices consisting of rarefied ASV reads per barcode, climate data and biocide types were used as input in the analytical pipeline summarised in . After the sCCA analysis the ASVs were assigned to family level where possible or at the next lowest classifier. The first step of the pipeline is preparing input matrices for ASVs, climate variables and biocides (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 1). The following step is a matrix-on-matrix regression, applied to correlate families called from the ASVs with either biocide type or climate variables (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 2). The top five components of the correlations, based on loading values, that explained the largest covariance between matrices were extracted from the sCCA, and the abiotic factors (climate variable and biocide type, separately) ranked according to their contribution to the overall covariance. A Sliding Window (Pearson) Correlation (SWC) analysis followed this step and was applied to each pair of vectors represented by the top ranked abiotic factor and the families. This approach was used to identify abiotic factors (either climate variables or biocide types) that significantly correlated with families over time, using the criterion that their Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.5, i.e. large effect size (Buckland and Gey, 1994) with an FDR adjusted p-value (padj) <0.05 following 10,000 permutations (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 3). The minimum sliding window size was set to 5 time points, corresponding to 15% of the total time window for which families, biocides and climate data were available (the 34 sediment layers from the sedimentary archive span 100 years). Time intervals with more than 50% zero values in either the biotic or the abiotic data were discarded from downstream analyses to reduce false positives. A recall rate was used to quantify the number of ASVs within a family that were individually significantly correlated with the abiotic variables over all ASVs in a given family (Buckland and Gey, 1994). The families that co-varied with either biocide types or climate variables over time were retained if they showed a Pearson correlation coefficient >0.5, a padj <0.05 and a recall rate >0.5 (90% quantile of the recall rates of all families; Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 4). This conservative approach enabled us to reduce noise from spurious correlations and improve accuracy.\n\nThe combined effect of environmental factors may have an augmented impact on biodiversity. To identify the combined effect of climate variables and biocides on the lake community biodiversity, we applied again the sCCA analysis (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 5). For this analysis, we selected the climate variables and biocide types contributing the largest covariances in the correlation analysis in Step 4. Their combined effect on a family was considered to be significant if the biocide type and the climate variable were each significantly correlated with the family over the same time window, and their average Pearson correlation was >0.5 with padj <0.05 (SWC analysis with 10,000 permutations) (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 6). The biocide type and the climate variable were interpreted to have an joint effect on a given family if the linear combination of the biocide type and the climate variable had a larger Pearson correlation coefficient than each of the correlations between the family and the biocide type and the family and the climate variable individually, in the same time interval with padj <0.05 (with 10,000 permutations in the SWC analysis).\n\nWithin each biocide type that significantly correlated with a family, we established their ranking based on the correlation coefficient (Appendix 1—figure 5; Step 6). Significant Pearson correlations that identified the joint effect of climate variables and individual biocides on a given family were identified with the same criteria outlined above (Pearson correlation >0.5; padj <0.05; SWC with 10,000 permutations). Chemicals with more than 50% null values or Pearson correlation coefficients <0.5 were discarded."
