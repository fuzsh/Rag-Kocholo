Taking off from Port Moresby and flying to Milne Bay. 67 AASL Coy was the first AASL Coy to tranship by air 11 February 1943 under command of Lieuts Tierney and Stewart. Milne Bay Harbour. The furthest vessel brought remainder of Coy from Port Moresby 17 February 1943. Looking west along the main road from Gili Gili which serves the Gurney Airstirp. Road is very narrow, not allowed to cut down coconut palms, caused many accidents and injuries. Sappers putting in a foundation for COR - the man chopping wood is Spr Neville Johnston. Coy HQ situated on a high bank on the Kilohi ? (Kalobi) River was the ideal camp site. Looking downstream, just below Station 5 - river not in flood but after heavy rain in the mountains it became a torrent four to six feet deep. Water would run through the cab of a marrooned GMC truck. Unknown sapper driving in post. After floods rocks would be laid bare and required moving not so much for trucks as for smaller vehicles. This jeep is negotiating a relatively smooth section but rocks were often moved to indicate the best crossing spots. Capt Emmett Lynch dropping stepping stones in Kalobi River. Walking though jungle on a \"fine\" day Captain Emmett Lynch. Clearing the thick jungle at Station 5's upper Kalobi River site. It was the most difficult site with so many large trees matted together with cane, vines and thick undergrowth. After the Sperry equipment was in postion the detachment set about cutting logs for steps to the site DC Sgt Stan Hennersy. The generator set was high on a shelf above flood level and the steps made it much easier to service the site. The natives used them in their treks across the range to visit their villages. Station 4 in the plantation area. A large number of palms had to be cut down to gain clearance for the searchlight beam. It was a Sperry station. Other stations were close to the water. There were stations all around the bay. This is the wharf that was used when visiting them. These are pearling luggers commandeered by the Army and used for eight day cruises for personel recovering from Malaria and other misfortunes. With a native to man the boat they were a wonderful tonic. The cargo vessel SS Anshun was shelled and sunk at Gili Gili wharf by the Japanese. Towing dinghies made them ship water. Transport officer Lt Frank Cleary. Approach a new site at Gilbara. Work in progress. Do you recognise the type of searchlight in the background. Yes its a Sperry. Site No.2 on Lavada Island. The sentry L/Cpl Ron \"Trigger\" Eaton has seen someone important approaching - Oh its us. We are on our way to site No. 3 at K.B. Mission just to the east the Japanese had landed and met stout resistance. And here they have a projector with Searchlight Control (SLC) that's what the aerials are - the first Radar searchlight. Lt Peter Bullock with aerial. The Company Operations Room (COR). The Coy found many bloody and grissly reminders of the encounter with the enemy. It was here the Japanese were first driven back North and our forces chased after them about 200 Kms to a new area around - caption shot \"Oro Bay\". Capt P Tierney and Lieut Howard Richardson of 67 AASL Coy found themselves in an area full of Americans but still with some evidence of Australia presence. Detachments were spread around Gona and Buna area and adjacent to the Kumusi River. Light stores and equipment were carried by boat from HQ at the Bay. Heavy stores were ferried by a home made pontoon - a timber deck laid over small boats. Station 4 was situated on a rise with dense mangroves between the Station and the shore. A strong timber cord track was built across the swamp to be christened later \"Home Leave Avenue\". This scene in the Oro Bay segment of men chopping and carrying coconut logs should be in the Milne Bay segment. The man on the right sharing the weight of a log is Ray \"Bowler\" Downey who was in the same detachment in Port Moresby, Milne Bay and Oro Bay. There were no coconuts growing on the site at Dobadura (Oro bay) where Ray served, it was flat Kunai grass country. Longing for the day when they could leave it all behind. This marker from the Kokoda Track showed how far away home was. But they get there soon.\n\nFilm order form"
