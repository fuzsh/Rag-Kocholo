        "text": "The simple definition for success is the accomplishment of an aim or a purpose. What unites all of the brands, families, groups and individuals featured in these pages is that they have had the audacity to dream big and the temerity, resilience, courage and capability to execute their goals.\n\nOne example is Jean Arnault who just two years ago had set out to completely change the world’s perception of Louis Vuitton watches and, through his bold relaunch of the Tambour and championing of independent watchmaking, has completely transformed the way we see Louis Vuitton today. As another example, it would be fair to say that this is the year we truly see the brilliance of Jean-Frédéric Dufour’s leadership at Rolex: first with the acquisition of Bucherer and Rolex’s first entry into retail; second, through the global elevation of Rolex watches in terms of quality, beauty and design; third, in the proliferation of the Rolex Certifed Pre-Owned (CPO) program; and fourth, in his elevation of Tudor to be the market leader in the luxury tool watch category.\n\nEven though François-Henry Bennahmias is leaving Audemars Piguet, his legacy in transforming this brand from a CHF 630 million a year business in 2012, to a CHF 2.01 billion a year juggernaut (with a 2023 estimate of CHF 2.4 billion) is extraordinary. And though he works decidedly behind the scenes, Omega’s Raynald Aeschlimann, who is growing in his job scope at the Swatch Group, continues to be one of the most impressive leaders on the market.\n\nRichemont Group’s three brilliant CEOs, Cyrille Vigneron of Cartier, Nicolas Bos of Van Cleef & Arpels and Louis Ferla of Vacheron Constantin (his brand is estimated to pass the CHF 1 billion mark this year), bring dynamism to their brands in a massive way. Among the family-run watch brands, Richard Mille has now firmly assured his succession plan with his very capable and incredibly dedicated son Alexandre Mille in place as brand director.\n\nPatek Philippe’s Thierry Stern continues to bring his brand from strength to strength even while grooming the next generation of Stern leadership. Finally, we also see a generational change beginning in Chopard with Caroline-Marie now working on product development with her father Karl-Friedrich, and her brother Karl-Fritz who is already responsible for the brand’s successful Alpine Eagle model is not long off from joining her.\n\nWhat are the key takeaways over the last decade? The growth of the watch industry has been mainly driven by the high-end brands.\n\nThe polarization of the industry with just a few brands producing high-value watches and fostered by strong brand equity, such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille, is reflecting the overall trend of the luxury industry, which is moving upwards in all product categories. One very distinctive difference of the watch industry compared with all other luxury product categories is that the privately owned brands are performing far better than the ones owned by listed luxury groups, albeit with one remarkable exception which is Hermès, even though the brand shares more characteristics of a family-owned company than a listed company with only 32.3 percent free float traded shares, but foremost a long-term view on the business.\n\nThe estimated wealth of the following 20 individuals, families, trusts, private or listed companies are based on their overall assets. Methodology is based on the estimated value of the market price — in the case of a listed brand or group — or the estimated value, which is a multiple of the estimated sales and EBITDA (the operational gross margin before taxes, depreciations and amortizations) on which I added the brand equity/goodwill.\n\nI also indicated the estimated retail market share of the Swiss-made or Swiss-owned watch industry to give an idea of how important the watch business is for each person or institution mentioned. These values (in CHF) were taken from the annual Morgan Stanley × LuxeConsult report last published in March 2023 based on the estimated 2022 sales.\n\nGirard-Perregaux was once upon a time at eye level with brands such as Vacheron Constantin and Breguet when the three of them were competing at the highest echelon of watchmaking. Since then, one brand, Vacheron Constantin, has managed to keep a positive dynamic to grow steadily and will probably integrate the top 10 of the Swiss-made watch brands in a not-too-distant future.\n\nGirard-Perregaux, on the contrary, has experienced a drastic fall of its sales since its owner family sold it to Kering in 2011 and from then on — due to strategic mistakes by the management — a negative dynamic started. Then in 2014, Kering acquired Ulysse Nardin, another mythical name of Swiss watchmaking with a strong heritage linked to marine chronometers, and Patrick Pruniaux became the CEO for both brands.\n\nWhen Max Büsser explained me the first time what MB&F was about, he lectured me on the fact that he wasn’t launching a brand, but a lab. I must admit that I took it more for arrogance than a brilliant idea.\n\nBut that was more than 17 years ago and his first timepiece, the Horological Machine No. 1 (HM1), had not yet been launched. It took me time to understand that Max was serious about reinventing the way a timepiece shows time.\n\nThe disruptive part of his concept is that each machine is totally different from the previous one, and is a 3D sculpture showing mechanics with very bold designs taking a lot of inspiration from cars — not from today, but from the golden age of supercars in the 1960s and 1970s when car designers would dare to create spaceships. For instance, the HM5 immediately reminded me of the Lamborghini Miura, which is still in my top 10 of the most beautiful cars ever.\n\nThe success of MB&F is very much based on Max’s charisma, but it would be unfair to reduce it to his good looks and intelligence. Max is very literate about watchmaking’s history and knows a thing or two about product design and coherent product concepts, having worked at Jaeger-LeCoultre and Harry Winston where he created the legendary Opus collaborations with independent master watchmakers.\n\nHe took that idea over when he created the MB&F concept and started collaborating with other watchmakers; for example, he worked with Kari Voutilainen on a Legacy Machine, which is Büsser’s way of paying tribute to fine watchmaking of the 18th century. And the “F” in the brand’s name is not only about the friends’ storytelling, but about being transparent on who does what.\n\nWhen I look at all those new brands popping up every other month with a new “Mozart of watchmaking” making the exact same watch as every independent, focusing more on the perfect polishing and engaging angles on the movement than on real innovation, I appreciate MB&F’s true innovative way of creating timepieces. Even though I hadn’t understood how disruptive Max’s approach would become, I was proven right at least on one aspect and that is, MB&F is a brand.\n\nAnd a fine and successful one employing 45 people and generating sales of more than CHF 40 million this year. However, Max’s impact on modern watchmaking far exceeds the company’s revenue figures.\n\nIt can be said that he is as instrumental to contemporary horology as Jean-Claude Biver has been to the previous generation, purely through the force of his personality, intelligence and charisma.\n\nWithout a doubt the most talented watchmaker of his generation, François-Paul Journe has not only created a unique product signature, but also foremost a brand. F.P. Journe is one of the very rare so-called independent watchmakers that have understood and managed to create a brand which will survive its namesake creator. And it is a fine watch brand with a very distinctive product signature paying tribute to fine French watchmaking of the 18th century.\n\nHis timepieces are fitting homages to the finest and most disruptive watchmakers of the golden age of fine watchmaking, such as Breguet, Berthoud and Leroy, amongst others. Someone who is literate about watchmaking history would have no problems understanding what Mr. Journe is doing when he works on the Résonance or his Centigraphe, which is an astonishing piece of micromechanics.\n\nBut the man is also capable of making his own electromechanical watches as seen in the Elégante collection dedicated to women. The concept is the perfect combination of the best of the mechanical world and quartz technology.\n\nThe maison F.P. Journe also owns its own manufacturing capacities producing its movements, cases and dials.\n\nThe brand relies on a very selective retail network and owns 11 mono-brand stores around the world. But what impresses me most is the sheer devotion of his clients who adore the man as if he was the head of a cult.\n\nAnother detail — which is in fact important — is the decision not to print or engrave the word “Swiss,” because Mr. Journe considers the Swiss-made hallmark not stringent enough for his creations. Instead, you’ll find an engraving on the movement saying “Geneva Made.”\n\nAnd the “Invenit et Fecit” (invented and made) tagline of the brand is a manifest of the DNA based on creating unseen concepts.\n\nLast but not least, the fact that Chanel — a major player in the luxury industry — has taken a 20 percent equity stake in F.P. Journe is a huge compliment for a brand created only 30 years ago with the first wristwatches launched in 1999. And I would like to finish with an anecdote from Baselworld that year where Mr. Journe attended with his business partner to meet some collectors.\n\nOne evening, the whole team of the brand I was working at was celebrating another record day with eight-figure total orders and we were wondering who that man at the back of the bar was. One colleague told us, “His name is Journe and someone told me that he will be the star of artisan watchmaking.”\n\nBut when he followed up that the guy was making less than 20 watches a year, we had a good laugh. Such is life.\n\nRaymond Weil used to be the first choice when you were looking for an affordable alternative for pricey institutional brands. Extremely successful in the 1990’s and beginning of the 2000’s with emblematic products and campaigns such as the “Parsifal”, the brand has however lost a lot of traction these days.\n\nExisting competitors, such as Tissot or Longines and new ones such as, Frédérique Constant, have made life hard for this brand competing with such heavy weights. The third generation of the owner family is still involved in the management of the brand but does not show a tremendous passion to reboost Raymond Weil to the path of growth.\n\nWith the recent acknowledgement by the GPHG however, for the Millésime Automatic Small Seconds which was awarded the Challenge Watch Prize by the Jury, Raymond Weil appears to be making a timely return to the forefront.\n\nMr. Kern has done a tremendous job by balancing the brand on three distinctive pillars linked to air, sea and land, with the engagement of brand ambassadors who are dubbed “squads” to imply that they’re part of the brand. The most obvious and — for some diehard fans of the brand — shocking part of the rebranding was to cut the wings in the brand’s logo which stood for Breitling’s dedication to aviation.\n\nComing from IWC where he had taken a lot of “inspiration” from Breitling to focus on aviation, Mr. Kern wanted to diversify the brand’s positioning and give it a broader basis in order to connect with younger demographics.\n\nThe first product launch under the new era was the Navitimer 8, which failed to attract new clients, and worse, disappointed the existing ones. Why? Because the Navitimer became an iconic product with its design of an instrument for the wrist for pilots and many more clients dreaming of being one.\n\nTaking these codes away simply did not resonate with the core and target audience.\n\nThat was a wakeup call telling the brand that modernizing icons might be a better idea than trying to reinvent them entirely, and since then, Breitling’s ride on the neo-vintage wave has been a lot more successful with, for instance, the launch of the Premier or Top Time, which are taking their legitimacy from the brand’s legacy. In addition, the partnership in Kenissi Manufacture, a joint venture where Breitling is partnering with Chanel and Tudor, is also giving the brand a lot more horological credibility.\n\nLast but not least, Breitling also has an innovative transversal business model offering ancillary services such as financing your watch with monthly instalments, which is a clever way to give access to younger demographics seeking to acquire luxury goods. Breitling was also amongst the first adopters of non-fungible token (NFT) technology in order to track a watch during its decade-long itinerary.\n\nThe most recent extensions of the brand are the opening of cafés and restaurants to create branded spaces of conviviality where selling products is not the primary purpose, but creating bonds with the clients is more important. Finally, the recent acquisition of Universal Genève revives another chapter for the storied brand. It’s one of the most anticipated returns in all of watchmaking and we can’t wait to hear about this success story.\n\nAny self-made entrepreneur has a good story to share when explaining how he built up his wealth. In the case of Miguel Rodriguez, the sole shareholder of the Festina Group, the story is true that he came to work in Switzerland as an operator of production machines for the watch industry.\n\nHe also likes to tell the story of how he was smuggling watches to Spain to make some money on the side which later on allowed him to buy his first Swiss watch brand, Festina. This laid ground to a group comprising other brands like Candino, Jaguar, Lotus (watches and jewels) and Perrelet.\n\nThe brand portfolio also includes Swedish brand, Kronaby which is making hybrid smartwatches. This links to the know-how of Soprod Quartz, one group owned manufacturing company capable of developing smartwatches from with proprietary technology.\n\nComing from the suppliers’ side, Vartan Sirmakes decided to invest as much as possible into the brand’s own manufacturing capacities. This strategy not only served the purpose of being reactive and cost-efficient but also lay the groundworks for the narrative of being a watch manufacture.\n\nEven if the brand has lost a lot of traction since more than a decade, it is still a relevant player in the high-end segment with an estimated 21,000 pieces and CHF 250m in watches sold last year. That is a lot, but still a lot less compared with the first decade of this century when it was selling for north of CHF 600m a year.\n\nWithout taking away any credit from Richard Mille’s phenomenal success, it is beyond questioning that Richard Mille took some inspiration for the product design from Franck Muller.\n\nOn the negative side, the brand which is part of an eponymous group, never succeeded in diversifying its brand portfolio beyond the main brand. All the projects — Karbon, MHR, European Company Watch (the name is already program) and Pierre Kunz — ended in the cemetery of the watch industry.\n\nEven Cvstos which is founded and managed by Vartan Sirmakes’ son Sassoun is not exactly a success story inasmuch as it’s surviving thanks to cross sales from the parent company.\n\nJacob & Co. is an incredible success story based on the vision of one man, Jacob Arabo, of making 3D fine watchmaking. When he was explaining his vision for his products to his manufacturing partners in Switzerland, they would politely listen to him, but wouldn’t buy into his weird ideas.\n\nOne day, a talented and creative watchmaker presented him with the concept of a highly complicated triple-axis tourbillon combined with three other arms, each displaying either a sphere or “Jacob-cut” diamond with 288 facets, and finally the time display, each turning at a different speed. Together with Valérien Jaquet of Concepto, Jacob proceeded to make this concept a reality.\n\nHe named it the Astronomia, and with it, Arabo propelled himself through sheer force of will into the horological big leagues.\n\nThe extraordinary idea behind the mechanical concept, which is already a feast for anyone interested in mechanical complications, is that the variations of displays are almost infinite. Jacob & Co. timepieces and jewelry — accounting for 75 percent and 25 percent of the brand’s sales, respectively — are bold and very distinctive. The brand has seen a very strong acceleration post-COVID of its sales, which grew 132 percent from 2020 to 2022.\n\nCertainly, it is a very interesting dual brand capable of creating marvels for affluent clients around the world who dare to wear very distinctive watches and jewels — and who are capable of paying north of CHF 600,000 for an Astronomia timepiece. The Swiss watch industry is by now not laughing anymore at that crazy American’s vision of a different way of making watches.\n\nChopard has a unique brand asset or unique selling proposition (USP) with the legendary Happy Diamonds even though it is no longer patent protected. Happy Diamonds is an extraordinary product concept, because it can be endlessly reinterpreted in different colors, sizes, materials, patterns and even shapes.\n\nIt is certainly Chopard’s hero product, generating a substantial proportion of the brand’s sales in its different versions, and iconic both for the watches and the jewelry. The flip side of owning such a wonderful asset is that the brand has lost a lot of traction especially in the watch business by not innovating enough.\n\nThe Mille Miglia product family launched in 1988 had shown the way by increasing the sales fivefold when it was still managed by a talented product director — Jean-Frédéric Dufour, no less, and yes, the same one who’s now running the show at Rolex.\n\nIn the past, Chopard faced challenges to establish the L.U.C in the elite league of mechanical watches, despite having developed top-notch movements which doesn’t have to fear any comparison with the likes of Patek Philippe or A. Lange & Söhne, but lacks brand sexiness for the die-hard collectors. However, in recent years, Chopard L.U.C in particular the stunning Revolution Award-winning 1860 Lucent Steel, has become one of the most sought after timepieces on the market.\n\nIt is nice to see that after 26 years, Chopard L.U.C is getting its much-deserved time in the spotlight. Chopard has also created the very appealing sports chic timepiece, the Alpine Eagle, to great results.\n\nAnd Scheufele’s dedication to movement innovation has yielded what Wei Koh feels is the “best sounding minute repeater in modern horology,” the L.U.C Full Strike. Finally, Scheufele has also successfully launched Ferdinand Berthoud, which now has a cult collectibility status expressed by a waiting list of three years for some of its models.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the third generation (or the fifth generation, if we take into account the pre-Chopard legacy of the family), in particular the very promising and young Karl-Fritz Scheufele, will bring their unique intelligence and energy to the brand and bring it back on a virtuous circle.\n\nThe challenges are multiple for a group still strongly led by the family with Nick Hayek Junior performing as the CEO of the group, Nayla Hayek — his sister — is the chairman of the board and Marc Hayek — her son — officially taking care of the luxury segment, but who is mainly looking after Blancpain. Strongly challenged by the success of the smartwatches, Swatch and Tissot have managed to bounce back recently with the massive success of the MoonSwatch (a collaboration between Swatch and Omega) and the successful Tissot PRX, respectively.\n\nIt should be said that with the MoonSwatch and now the Swatch Blancpain “Scuba Fifty Fathoms” diving watches, Hayek Jr. has brilliantly capitalized on collaborations within his own group, which has resulted in the creation of a cultural phenomenon, especially amongst the younger generation, the likes of which our industry has not seen since his father hung a massive Swatch watch on the side of a building to announce its arrival. These collaborations have vitally engaged in building watch culture and awareness in the next generation and Hayek deserves to be applauded for this.\n\nOn the subject of the next generation, one extremely interesting and promising young Hayek is Nick III, a young man studying hotel management at the elite EHL (formerly known as the École Hôtelière de Lausanne) and one of the most passionate and insightful young collectors Revolution’s founder Wei Koh has met in recent years.\n\nThe Swatch Group is very important for the whole structure of the Swiss watch industry, because it is a systemic part of it. The group manufactures and sells two thirds of the overall volume of the Swiss watch industry, and is stricto sensu the only fully integrated industrial manufacture, even though one can argue that Rolex and Richemont are de facto at the same level of industrial integration, at least for the mechanical watches.\n\nWhen it comes to brand equity, there is no greater brand than Patek Philippe and that is down to the brilliance in leadership of the Stern family, now in its fourth generation at the helm. Many say that Patek Philippe is considered to be the “Rolls-Royce” of watch brands. However, I feel the far more accurate statement is that Rolls-Royce is the Patek Philippe of automobiles.\n\nThat is, even though Patek is neither the oldest nor historically the most successful brand. In fact, the Stern family had to buy the brand in 1932 because the company was in great financial despair as a result of the overall disastrous economic situation of the Great Depression, where it ended up owing the Stern dial manufacturing company a lot of money.\n\nAnd that was when the magic began to happen with the creation in 1932 of the Reference 560, in 1936 the Reference 130 and in 1941 the two greatest complication watches ever created, the References 1518 and 1526. Following that, Patek Philippe became the unrivaled King of Complications and remained so ahead of its competition it should be placed in a category all its own.\n\nPerhaps most special of all is that Patek Philippe, unlike Rolls-Royce which has been owned by BMW since 1998, is still 100 percent privately owned by the Stern family and run like a family business.\n\nPatek Philippe has also become the referential watch brand in the categories of the high-end and the sports chic stainless steel watch with its iconic Nautilus and Aquanaut models. The brand’s image has been fostered by a very strong communication campaign which, since 1996, has staked the claim that “You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.”\n\nThe claim is so strong because it not only implies that the timepiece you have acquired is there to stay for eternity and will be passed on from generation to generation, but more importantly, it also binds the brand into your family legacy.\n\nPatek Philippe has invested tremendous amounts of money into its manufacturing capacities in Geneva and elsewhere in Switzerland. Starting with the inauguration of the new manufacture of Plan-les-Ouates in 1996 and steadily increasing its production and sales volumes, the company invested billions of Swiss francs in buildings, machines and, last but not least, training people.\n\nThe latest investment amounts to CHF 600 million for the building and the machines, and everything is self-financed. The company doesn’t owe a cent to any bank and the genius that is Mr. Philippe Stern — Thierry Stern’s father who is the actual owner of the brand — paid in advance all the succession fees in 2014 so that his children, Thierry and his sister Christine, would not have to take on a heavy cash burden to pay for those.\n\nThose taxes were not paid by petty cash, but at a whopping CHF 415 million created quite an uproar in the press because everyone was guessing who could have paid that substantial amount of money at once. While many names have been mentioned as the greatest leader in watchmaking of all time, it is Revolution founder Wei Koh’s opinion that “Philippe Stern is the watch industry’s greatest innovator, pioneer and leader.”\n\nHe built the world’s greatest watch museum, helmed the world’s greatest watch campaign, created the most single most beautiful watch of the modern era, the Reference 5004, and positioned Patek and especially its complications to be the unobtainium of the watch world.\n\nEven though 2022 was already an exceptional year with the 50th jubilee of the brand’s iconic Royal Oak and a firework of limited editions relating to this commemoration, 2025 will mark the 150th birthday of AP and we can certainly expect some marvels. Finally, as he departs, it is clear Bennahmias still has his eye on increasing revenue past the CHF 3 billion mark by targeting the female customer.\n\nAs he explained to us, “I want our women’s watches to be the Birkin bags of watchmaking. No luxury watch brand today has achieved parity between male and female customers; we may well be the first.” Was this part of the decision-making in hiring a female CEO in Ilaria Resta? Bennahmias claims it isn’t but it certainly can’t hurt.\n\nRolex has a dominant position in the luxury watch segment that not a single luxury brand can claim to have. It has an estimated 40 percent market share of the U.S. luxury watch market, which is also the biggest in the world.\n\nThe brand sold 1.2 million watches per annum in 2022 which generated CHF 9.3 billion in sales. But this is at wholesale because, until this year, Rolex worked exclusively with partners creating almost CHF 5 billion for the world’s best, and let’s face it luckiest, retailers on the planet.\n\nI had written about the Bucherer deal in an article here that it was quite surprising that Rolex would leave a good CHF 4.65 billion on the table by not owning its own retail. Back then, I posed the question: “Now let’s imagine that Rolex decides to integrate their retail network entirely or partially. What would it mean in terms of profitability and the consequences on the worldwide retail structure?”\n\nFor five years, Rolex and Patek Philippe were “anomalies” in the wake of a direct-to-consumer strategy where luxury brands were gearing towards more control of the value chain to the client’s wrist. It’s not so much about capturing more margin, but foremost about controlling the brand’s image and collecting client data.\n\nAfter having launched its Certified Pre-Owned program with Bucherer, the next step which had been in the pipelines for years, was just logical with the integration of its most important retailer. And for sure Rolex won’t stop in its consolidation of its retail activities.\n\nThe next acquisitions — yes, plural — are on the radar and these will be significant and game changers, just as the acquisition of Bucherer has been.\n\nVery few luxury brands are based on such strong fundamentals as comparable with Chanel, which is best known for its fashion and bags, but yet has also successfully managed to diversify with other product categories such as watches. One remarkable accomplishment is the fact that the J12 watch launched in 1999 has already achieved the status of an icon, not only thanks to a distinctive design, but also clever marketing.\n\nUnlike what Jean-Claude Biver preaches, you don’t need to be first. What you need to do is make people believe that you master it best and that was what Chanel had done when it launched the J12 in ceramic, 13 years after Rado which is no longer today the “King of Ceramic.”\n\nChanel immediately signaled that its ambitions in watchmaking were going beyond just making an accessory product. The brand immediately invested in production facilities in Switzerland and began producing ceramic components at a company called Châtelain (which also produces the ceramic bracelets and cases for even some of the most desirable brands in Swiss watchmaking).\n\nIt then went on to buy Romain Gauthier’s movement manufacture with which it was already collaborating for mechanical movements such as the Monsieur Caliber. And most importantly, Chanel is one of the partners of the powerhouse that is Kenissi Manufacture, making mechanical movements for Breitling, Tudor and the brand’s J12.\n\nChanel has also taken a 20 percent stake in F.P. Journe in 2018, but this seems more patronage than a strategic business move, unless there is a shareholders’ agreement in place with a right of preemption to ensure the long-term growth of the eponymous niche brand."
