        "text": "Introduction\n\nOptical forces emerge from momentum exchange between light and matter [1]. Despite their minuteness, they yield macroscopic consequences in extraterrestrial affairs. For example, in the 17th century, Kepler had already recognized that the tails of comets are a consequence of the light pressure produced by the Sun's light [2]. 56 More recently, radiation pressure has been shown to be a key factor to ensure the stability of a star against gravitational collapse [3]. However, their role in laboratory experiments on Earth was elusive for many years [4, 5]. The turning point came with the advent of the laser age that offered intense and coherent light sources [6]. These were used by Arthur Ashkin [7] and co-workers in a series of pioneering experiments to trap and manipulate particles [8, 9], atoms [10–12], and biological matter [13, 14].\n\nIn their simplest configuration, optical tweezers are created by a single laser beam focused down to its diffraction limit, which creates the light intensity gradients needed to hold particles in three dimensions. Today, optical tweezers have become sophisticated and versatile instruments that can hold, guide, push, stretch, poke, probe, and sort particles, ranging from single atoms to microparticles, to cells and bacteria in a variety of environments, such as liquids, gases, or vacuum (figure 1).\n\nIn this Roadmap, we collected a series of perspectives that give an overview of the different research areas where optical tweezers have found application and have advanced the science of light–matter interactions further. We also look at current and future challenges in the field and provide insights into what are the possible future directions for the field. This Roadmap is organized as follows. We start by presenting information on experimental designs and setups, from the standard single-beam configuration to more complex designs, including recent developments employing intracavity feedback and metamaterials to generate optical forces. Then, we explore some fundamental aspects of theory and simulations that are crucial for a deeper understanding of experiments. Subsequently, we highlight some key applications for the accurate measurement of forces and torques. We show how the tweezers can be used for the characterization of the microrheological properties of fluids, the control and manipulation of nanoparticles, the trapping of particles in gas and vacuum, the exploration of statistical physics and nanothermodynamics, their combination with spectroscopy, their use for the study of biological matter from biomolecules to cells, and the use of optical forces in space applications. This Roadmap provides both an overview of the current state of the art in optical tweezers research and a guidance towards its future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nO M M and G V acknowledge support from the MSCA-ITN-ETN project ActiveMatter sponsored by the European Commission (Horizon 2020, Project No. 812780).

Optical tweezers setups\n\nGiuseppe Pesce\n\nDipartimento di Fisica, Università degli studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy\n\nStatus\n\nIn 1986, Arthur Ashkin and colleagues successfully trapped, in 3D, micrometre- and nanometre-sized particles, dispersed in water, with a laser beam focused by a high-numerical-aperture objective lens [9] (figure 2). This is how the amazing and powerful world of optical manipulation began. Since then, optical manipulation has been used in a myriad of experiments across different fields: biology, statistical mechanics, rheology, opto- and bio-fluidics, and plasmonics are only a few examples of research fields where optical tweezers (OTs) played a key role. The ability to manipulate microscopic objects in a contactless manner was rapidly overcome by more quantitative experiments. OTs are not just simple 'tweezers': they are force transducers, as they can exert and measure forces, very tiny forces. The available range spans a very interesting scale: from few piconewtons (pN) down to few femtonewtons (fN). In fact, OTs expanded this range, until then dominated, but also limited, by atomic force microscopy. This force range is extremely interesting since it comprises many biological, chemical and, more in general, condensed matter interactions. The typical trapping stiffness for 1–2 μm particles is of the order of 1 pN μm−1 that corresponds to energies of few kBT, i.e. energies comparable to those of thermal baths. Specifically, the dynamics of trapped particles can be used to understand the thermodynamics properties of the medium in which the particles are dispersed. Thus, OTs were immediately employed in statistical mechanics as well as in microrheology [1].\n\nThe need to unveil so many different phenomena stimulated researchers to develop new setup schemes and novel trapping techniques [15, 16]. The single-laser-beam OT immediately turned into OTs with two or more laser beams, first dividing the beam with beam splitters then using acousto-optical deflectors to obtain time-shared traps. Later, very versatile devices, like spatial light modulators, allowed researchers to explore other directions far away from simple trapping and manipulation. With these devices the light wavefront can be modified and engineered on demand: initially, multiple trapping, optical lattices, and sieves demonstrated the power of this new technique, but it did not take long to see experiments where the angular momentum of light played a key role.\n\nDespite its nearly 40 year history, optical trapping and manipulation is still an active research field. The recent advances in the trapping of nanoparticles in vacuum have opened up new challenges on testing fundamental physics, and quantum information science, many-body physics, metrology, quantum optics and ultracold chemistry.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nIn biological applications, OTs have contributed to the achievement of exceptional results. Nevertheless, one of their main limitations still needs to be resolved. To exert reasonable forces on biological samples, OTs use several milliwatts of light power that, even if at infrared wavelengths where the absorption is reduced, could damage the sample. Several attempts have been made to solve this issue, mainly using handles (beads or structures made with appropriate shapes) that once trapped can be used to manipulate cells and avoid heating due to incident light. Solving this issue is of fundamental importance to boost the usefulness of OTs in biomedical applications, especially for in vivo scenarios [17].\n\nAnother aspect that currently hampers OT applicability, limiting it prevalently to fundamental research only, is the size and cost of setups. Turnkey systems, provided by some companies, have quite high prices, because of the costs of optical components and those related to the development of stable systems. In fact, they are expected to provide easy and reliable operation.\n\nOTs require microscope objectives to obtain gradient forces high enough to reach the trapping conditions, otherwise two counter-propagating beams can be used to cancel the scattering force; this represents a great limit in setup development. Home-made systems can be less expensive, but are often too sophisticated and very large in size to be handled by inexperienced personnel and in routine applications, even if built with commercial microscopes. Moreover, they comprise microscope objectives, whose price is in the order of thousands of euros. Alternative solutions to microscope objectives are based on the use of optics fibres, which can be arranged in counter-propagating beams or by creating a lens at their tip that is able to strongly focus the laser light and obtain trapping conditions. Microfluidics and fibre optics have greatly helped to move towards automatization and compactness, but a stand-alone trapping chip device is far from from being realized.\n\nVery recently, research in optical manipulation has shown a renewed interest in trapping in air and in vacuum. In vacuum the motion of an optically levitated dielectric nanosphere is well isolated from the environment and, with appropriate techniques, it is possible to cool down the motional energy of a trapped particle to demonstrate the quantum behaviour of a macroscopic object at room temperature. Consequently, setups are becoming increasingly sophisticated and new technical challenges must be faced [16].\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nTo overcome the issue of thermal damage to biological samples caused by laser power, several approaches can be pursued. A possibility is to develop new trapping schemes that use higher trapping efficiency. Very recently, a new idea based on intracavity trapping has been proposed and demonstrated [18]. Trapping occurs inside a laser cavity instead of the usual practice of using its output laser beam. The trapped object increases the power losses when it is at the beam waist centre so that the power is low: as it moves out, losses decrease and the power increases, pulling the object towards the centre and the power decreases again.\n\nOther possibilities rely on developing special handles so that the parts in contact with the cells are not held directly by the laser beam. This is quite simple to do, and it is already widely used, but is limited to manipulation only. If quantitative measurements are required, it is necessary to explore new ideas. Other physical effects can also be used. Li and colleagues proposed an interesting solution, where the laser beam cools down a small volume of appropriate material and samples are trapped by thermophoresis [19].\n\nHowever, the main issue, especially when looking at the establishment of OTs as a routine technique, remains the cost and the size of the setup. OTs are strictly bonded to microscope objectives. Efforts should be made to develop new technologies that are able to produce smaller and less expensive lenses with the same focusing properties. Metamaterials have been successfully used to create a very tiny meta-lens using nanopillars on a glass coverslip [20, 21]. This still has some limitations in terms of flexibility and applicability, since the lens is fabricated on the substrate, and its position and trapping depth are fixed or very limited; nevertheless, this may pave the way towards new and interesting directions.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe ability to manipulate small objects with focused laser beams opened up a broad spectrum of opportunities in fundamental and applied studies, such as biosciences, sorting, guiding, and analysis of materials. These experiments require precise control over mechanical paths and high stability. OT setups are cumbersome and are limited by a lack of flexibility and integrability. The cost of optical components is another key point that restricts the diffusion of trapping and manipulations setups. Since their beginning, about 40 years ago, OTs have shown a constant tendency to evolve by exploiting new research quests which are only limited by the advances in technology.\n\n2. Structured light for the tuning of light–matter interactions\n\nAlexander B Stilgoe and Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop\n\nARC CoE for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Mathematics and Physics, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\n\nStatus\n\nThe use of structured light permits one to alter on demand the properties of optical tweezers by altering the properties of the wavefront that generates it. Thus, optical tweezers that employ structured light can be used to more finely manipulate trapped objects, and they have been applied to gain a deep understanding of several complex biological and physical systems [22]. Light can be structured/sculpted by modifying its intensity distribution, phase, and polarization states using various spatial light modulator (SLM) technologies. Two common SLM technologies that are used to create structured light are derived from liquid crystals and digital micromirror devices. These devices enable manipulation of the intensity and phase of the light as well as polarization states. Structured light enables unprecedented control over light–matter interactions. The historical killer application of beam shaping using these devices has tended to be the multiple independent control of focused Gaussian spots or the introduction of angular momentum through azimuthal phase ramps in the Fourier plane [22, 23]. The operational effect is the transfer of momentum to particles with refractive index contrast to the surrounding medium through refraction and interference. More recently, the spatially varying phase, amplitude, and polarization have been developed to enhance control of light–matter interactions, such as the transfer of the exotic transverse angular momentum [24] (also figure 3), or the multiple independent control of radial, linear, or azimuthally polarized laser beam traps [25, 26]. An opportunity for the development of a powerful new technique based on the theory of the optimal control of light–matter interaction to precisely control not merely linear, but also angular transfers of momentum, exist. Demonstrations of exceptional change in linear momentum have been demonstrated using carefully structured light [27, 28], and the modification of particle properties [28, 29].\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nThe idea of controlling the electromagnetic coupling between the incident and scattered components of light scattered by a particular particle is well established [27, 30] but it is limited by a set of challenges.\n\nOrdinarily, optical tweezers act on spherical particles with simple structured laser beams. Simple and not necessarily complementary transfers of linear and angular momentum occur. For example, Laguerre–Gaussian type beam modes with a large azimuthal number are notoriously poor at confining small particles to the focus of a beam in 3D, but contain large quantities of orbital angular momentum. Simultaneous control of stable linear and angular momentum transfer to matter is elusive. Partly, this is due to the homogeneity of the plastic and glass particles commonly used in optical tweezers. Strongly anisotropic particles, such as those with shape and material birefringence, trirefringence, or exceptionally high-refractive-index objects [29], have much richer interactions with the electromagnetic field. Exotic particles can have capabilities beyond those of ordinary materials [28, 29], such as forces on the nano-newton scale and the transfer of spin or orbital angular momentum. To precisely control these exotic particles, we have to understand what the best arrangement of modes is to do so. Gaussian and higher-order Laguerre– or Hermite–Gaussian modes are not good candidates to control these particles as their optimal interactions are influenced by interference and emergent dielectric resonances [30].\n\nOptimized light fields have been experimentally realized for a range of different momentum operators in 2D [30]. The extension to 3D is possible. However, there are challenges with these approaches: namely, interactions are generally derived from the eigenspectrum of the effective measurement of momentum. Two problems arise that need to be addressed: (1) not all fields are realisable, particularly in optical tweezers where light moves through an aperture, and (2) optimization of one parameter, such as spin angular momentum transfer or stiffness in one dimension, will not necessarily yield a field in which a particle can be either levitated or three dimensionally trapped (figure 4). There are some strategies that can address this, ranging from modification of the theories to allow more stable configurations of less optimal transfers of momentum, to increasing the number of manipulated states, and to using a specially designed structure: for example, self-stabilizing levitation of a surface in low pressures [31].\n\nThe technical problems associated with producing a stable configuration and thus allowing for less optimal transfers of momentum run deep as there are a large number of ways that a momentum transfer may be made suboptimal but very few that will sufficiently improve stability. Subtle differences in the dimension and shape of particles are known to influence measurements in ordinary optical trapping experiments. In these circumstances, it will also prevent the achievement of both optimal interactions and the correction for trapping stability.\n\nVectoral beam shaping techniques can be used to increase the number of states in the light–particle interaction. The challenge with implementation will be ensuring good beam quality, stability (reliability), and alignment of the different polarization channels and will remain an ongoing battle [26].\n\nSpecially designed surfaces are an interesting approach. The challenge here is to design materials/structure that also allow for further enhancement of the light–matter interaction with the structured light that may be needed for a particular type of momentum transfer.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nMarrying exotic particles with beam shaping could prove to be a powerful technique that has applications not only in trapping in water, but the examination of macroscopic levitated quantum states. There have been impressive and interesting developments in this area [32, 33] that have developed subtle control and sensitive detection of particles that may be more generally usable for fluid environments.\n\nThe power of optimized structured light and materials lies in the ability to precisely tune the light–matter interaction: for example, to enable new high-precision measurements of position and momentum, or extend trapping to low or negative refractive index contrasts, or to self-contained lab-on-a-chip devices. Recent developments in the consistent and rapid measurement of viscosity at ballistic timescales [34] would be enhanced through the inclusion of shaped particles and optimized/shaped trapping fields.\n\nAddressing the stable configuration challenge may be the hardest of those listed here. The solution requires a clearly laid out problem, where an optimization can be performed that also preserves the desired properties of the optical trap, for example, a stable trapping position, or a consistent transverse of torque with rotation (see the left panel of figure 3, where two alignments of the optical axis have different levels of torque transfer). Perhaps moving away from the optimization using an effective momentum measurement operator is a good idea as it cannot, by its very construction, have a good solution with these constraints.\n\nThe preferred solution for vectorial beam shaping would be the production of Huygens' style sources of on-demand beams with spatially varying polarization. The use of polarized light shaping is growing and this may be a product that becomes available in the near future. Otherwise, better designs of the polarization shifting interferometers will be needed to increase stability and allow optimal light–matter interactions.\n\nAs fabrication technology continually advances, new and structured materials will become available over time. There are two levels of the complexity of the design of these materials. The first is where simple beams and plane waves supply the momentum to control them. The situation where structured illumination is used is much less certain. It provides an opportunity to investigate various forms of iterative design, where a light field and its target object can be subject to individual constraints, such as uniform polarization, pulse mode operation, and feature size. It provides one of the most flexible approaches to the problem of enhancing optical trapping in multiple translational and rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nUnprecedented versatility and superb control of light–matter interaction at the nano- and micro-scale has been enabled with optical beam shaping. The progress made to date is extremely encouraging. However, there are still outstanding challenges in applying these methods to a wide variety of systems. There are remaining questions on how to tune light–matter interactions for versatile uses in an arbitrary system. The availability of well-defined and dynamic structured light fields could enable novel studies in complex biological systems where there may be limitations in knowledge about the scattering properties in the surrounding environment. New shaped fields could open up investigations and further exciting studies in the interface of classical and quantum mechanics by allowing more precise tuning of the momentum transferred to and from a target system, allowing a better understanding of phenomena, such as the cooling to the ground state of systems over a large size range, studies of quantum behaviour at these scales, and out-of-equilibrium phenomena. The combination of optical tweezers using highly structured light fields with other imaging and spectroscopic techniques could enable insights into the burgeoning fields of quantum biotechnology and continue its contribution to the understanding of mechanobiology, physics, and chemistry on microscopic size scales.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP180101002 and from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems (EQUS,385 CE170100009).\n\n3. Speckle optical tweezers\n\nGiorgio Volpe\n\nDepartment of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AJ, United Kingdom\n\nStatus\n\nSpeckle optical tweezers are an optical manipulation technique that relies on disordered light fields to exert optical forces on micro- and nano-particles [35] (figure 5). They are named after optical speckle patterns, which are light fields with a random appearance but with universal statistical properties [36]. These optical patterns result from the interference of several optical waves with random phases. For a long time, the field of optical trapping and manipulation has considered these light patterns as an undesirable consequence of the propagation of coherent light through optically complex media, such as diffusers, multimode optical fibres, colloidal dispersions, turbid liquids, and biological tissue. In contrast to most optical manipulation techniques, where disorder is an issue to be minimized, speckle optical tweezers take advantage of the random nature of these light fields to address fundamental physical questions and for applications in microfluidics [35–37]. Historically, the atom-cooling community was the first to adopt speckle light fields to trap small particles [38]. The last decade has experienced a revival of the technique to tackle questions in mesoscopic physics, where both static and time-varying speckle optical potentials have been used to study the emergence of anomalous diffusion (from subdiffusion to superdiffusion) in colloidal dispersions [36, 39–42], to tune effective dispersion forces between small colloidal particles [43], to perform standard microfluidic operations, such as particle guiding and sorting [35], to assemble 2D crystal-like and glassy colloidal materials [44], to control collective behaviour in active matter [45], and to reproduce first-passage statistics [46].\n\nThe future appeal of the technique (subject to further technical advances) is both fundamental and applied. On a more fundamental side, speckle optical tweezers can be further developed into a fully controllable proxy for many natural phenomena where particles move within potentials in the presence of disorder. Examples range from the emergence and propagation of defects in materials to the motility of molecules and organelles in cells, from the individual and collective motility of groups of animals to the diffusion of stars within a galaxy. The desirable feature in this model system would be that all variables and degrees of freedom of interest can, in principle, be controlled at the touch of a knob, i.e. light. On a more applied note, speckle optical tweezers can outperform standard optical manipulation techniques in instances (e.g. in microfluidic and biomedical applications), where simplicity of operation and robustness to environmental noise are key.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nThe main research challenge behind further advancements in speckle optical tweezers is intimately connected with the nature of optical disorder and its control. As the statistical properties of standard optical speckle patterns (i.e. their intensity distribution and correlation function) are universal [36], advancements in the field will go hand in hand with advancements in our capabilities to engineer disordered optical potentials in space and time:\n\nStructured speckle tweezers. Despite their random appearance, the universal properties of speckle fields have been harnessed to influence the translational diffusion of microscopic particles [36, 39–41]. Customizing speckle properties by modulating the amplitude, phase, and polarization of the light field can enable the implementation of more complex speckle patterns with, e.g. tailored intensity distributions and correlations. Speckle optical tweezers could therefore be applied to perform complex optical manipulation tasks based on controlling both the translational and rotational diffusion of microparticles, such as by introducing short-, mid-, and long-range correlations in the particles' motion or by generating torques with advanced disordered non-conservative force fields.\n\nThree-dimensional speckle tweezers. A key feature of many optical manipulation techniques is the ability to trap and guide particles in 3D space using single or multiple laser beams. A downside of most current speckle tweezers setups is that they can be operated primarily near a surface or at an interface. Indeed, the diffraction processes typically used to generate speckle patterns lead to out-of-plane divergence and longitudinal speckle grain elongation. Both aspects hamper non-trivial 3D manipulation tasks with speckle optical potentials. Controlling the statistics of optical disorder over a volume (i.e. along the direction of light propagation as well as along the transverse plane) could enable the systematic extension of the technique to the third dimension [37].\n\nNear-field speckle tweezers. While trapping with random plasmonic islands has been demonstrated [47], using the localized fields generated by random metallic or dielectric nanostructures to manipulate small particles has an untapped potential for scaling speckle tweezers down towards the molecular level and for embedding them with molecular spectroscopy and sensing capabilities.\n\nIn vivo speckle tweezers. Finally, particularly alluring is the possibility of using speckle optical tweezers to directly manipulate matter in vivo, where the exploitation of other non-invasive optical manipulation techniques is compromized by the natural optical turbidity of biological tissue. Nonetheless, for this to happen, optical methods need to be able to penetrate deeper into tissue and guarantee that adequate levels of power and imaging capabilities are met simultaneously.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nAs speckle optical tweezers operate by exploiting complex optical potentials, developments in the field will benefit greatly from further scientific and technological advances in the fields of structured light and complex photonics. The possibility of structuring disordered optical potentials in three dimensions is intimately connected with our technical capabilities to control a large number of optical modes as well as all three components of the electric field simultaneously. Current wavefront shaping devices, such as spatial light modulators and digital micromirror devices, have driven significant scientific progress so far in these fields. Further development of these technologies (in terms of, e.g. efficiency, number of pixels, spatial homogeneity, pixel crosstalks, spectral bandwidth and speed) together with the advent of novel devices capable of independently controlling all classical degrees of freedom of light at once will also undoubtedly expand the range of applications for speckle optical tweezers. Similarly, the realization and adoption of turnkey laser systems, capable of supplying light beams with tailored structures, would enable the straightforward generation of a great variety of high-power complex optical potentials for optical manipulation purposes. Alternatively, the fabrication of disordered plasmonic and dielectric surfaces and metasurfaces for the generation of structured light within optofluidic chips or at the distal end of an optical fibre can help the miniaturization of speckle optical tweezers, their extension to trapping applications on the nanoscale, and their use for in vivo optical manipulation tasks. This possibility, while alluring, places high strains on current nanofabrication methods and modelling techniques. Moreover, non-invasive in vivo applications of speckle optical tweezers require light-shaping methods to guarantee higher efficiencies in terms of enhancing and stabilizing trapping potentials deep within tissue. Improvements in deep-tissue imaging techniques (e.g. based on acoustic guiding), fast data handling and machine learning methods will also be a welcome development for the in vivo implementation of speckle optical tweezers. Finally, from a more pragmatic point of view, simplicity of operation, robustness to environmental noise, and low cost are major selling points for current speckle optical tweezer setups. Thus, any technical development that extends the range of operability of this technique will need to be affordable and easily available to the broader scientific and engineering community. To date, affordability remains a major practical challenge to the integration of novel technology in speckle optical tweezer setups.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn conclusions, despite the random appearance of optical speckle fields, their statistical properties have been exploited to control and manipulate the diffusion properties of small particles. Although carefully engineered periodic potentials can perform better in specific optical manipulation applications, speckle optical tweezers offer additional advantages as they are intrinsically simple to operate, low cost, widefield, and robust to aberrations from the optics and the surrounding environment. Beyond their applied interest for microfluidic, biomedical, and in vivo applications, speckle optical tweezers are an ideal tool in the hands of researchers to tackle fundamental scientific questions in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics and materials science. To expand the applicability of this tool further, the possibility of structuring optical disorder in two and three dimensions in space and over time is an attractive avenue to directly engineer new light–matter interactions in random optical potentials. Nonetheless, to maintain the broad appeal of speckle optical tweezers, it is key that the integration of novel technologies does not alter the fundamental character of the method, i.e. its accessibility to an extended scientific and technical audience.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to acknowledge Sylvain Gigan and Giovanni Volpe for critical reading and fruitful discussions on the future of the technique.\n\n4. Optical trapping and manipulation mediated by optical nanofibres\n\nGeorgiy Tkachenko, Viet Giang Truong and Síle Nic Chormaic\n\nOkinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Japan\n\nStatus\n\nOptical nanofibres (ONFs) are waveguides produced by controlled drawing of a transparent material (most commonly glass softened by local heating), a technology largely developed over the last two decades [48]. The thinnest region or 'waist' of an ONF has a diameter comparable to the working wavelength. Strong transverse confinement of the guided light at the waist leads to a significant evanescent field near the fibre surface and to radical restrictions of the allowed guided modes. In particular, if an ONF is sufficiently thin, it operates in the single-mode regime, where the internal and external field profiles are the most predictable.\n\nONFs have many attractive features, which explain their broad range of applications. Here, we focus on optomechanical ones, where material objects can be trapped or acquire forces and torques by interactions with ONF evanescent fields (see the overview in figure 6). The large gradients and intensities of these fields are comparable to those of standard optical tweezers. Therefore, much like a tightly focussed laser beam, an ONF can stably trap dielectric particles in 2D by gradient optical forces. However, unlike a free-space beam, a single guided mode of an ONF has no restrictions in the axial direction, and the captured particle is optically propelled along the fibre [49]. When an ONF simultaneously captures multiple particles, they become optically bound to each other through the waveguide and the surrounding medium [50]. A recent study has demonstrated that ONFs show great potential for optical manipulation of composite metallo-dielectric particles [51], which are notoriously difficult to handle with free-space optical fields. Besides linear manipulation (trapping, propulsion, binding), ONFs can mediate light-induced rotation of material objects [52]. Free-space fields are often structured for spatial filtering and advanced optical manipulation and, similarly, the ONF-guided light can be made highly inhomogeneous in intensity or polarization by using interfering fundamental modes or higher-order modes [53]. One of the unique features of ONF technology is the possibility to structure the fibre itself by nanomachining [54] to incorporate cavities or metastructures, an option largely unexplored within the context of optical trapping and manipulation. A major and arguably the most promising area of research involving ONFs concerns optical trapping and interfacing of laser-cooled atoms and other quantum emitters [55]. Note that such a radical downsizing of the manipulated object brings extra complexity to the ONF-based trapping; for instance, the scheme with two-coloured (attractive and repulsive) near-resonant modes is the standard approach for neutral atoms [56].\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nOverall, ONF-based photonics and optomechanics are in their early development stages, with many challenges remaining on the route to realization of the full application potential of this technology. By the nature of their applications, ONFs must have low losses and highly predictable geometrical parameters of the waist region. Losses are especially important in experiments with quantum emitters, where the signal-to-noise ratio is critical and ONFs are held in ultrahigh vacuum making heat dissipation very difficult. Obviously, heating increases the noise and severely lowers the optical damage threshold for the fibre. The existing fabrication techniques allow one to produce low-loss ONFs with the needed parameters, but currently there are no industry-standard implementations of an ONF-drawing rig. As a result, the fabrication quality varies greatly between custom-built systems, strongly depending on the operator's ability to calibrate and maintain the equipment, and even to handle the fibres. Moreover, the existing methods for precise characterization require near-field scanning, which renders the probed nanofibre unusable for most applications. Therefore, improvement of the fabrication repeatability remains one of the major challenges for ONF technology.\n\nIn theory, unstructured ONFs are cylindrically symmetric and therefore do not alter the guided mode during propagation. However, experiments show that the symmetry is broken even in single-mode ONFs, where uncontrolled stress birefringence transforms the polarization of guided light. While for an adiabatic single-mode ONF, these transformations can be undone using the Poincaré-sphere representation of the polarization states at the waist [52], reliable control of higher-order modes in ONFs still evades experimentalists. This practical issue limits the use of ONFs to the single-mode regime and theoretical predictions involving vectorial evanescent fields [53] remain unrealized.\n\nAnother big challenge with ONF-based systems is scalability. To date, they are built around a single ONF waist, which is used for optical manipulation or interfacing of colloidal particles or quantum emitters. While high-throughput lab-on-a-chip devices for handling colloidal particles with multiple ONFs are relatively easy to imagine, multiplexing for quantum ONF-based applications is much more challenging. One very promising solution involves Rydberg atoms coupled to an ONF; however, it is not clear whether such atoms can be arranged in a chain and addressed independently to work as a quantum simulator [57]. It is feasible that multiple ONFs coupled to quantum emitters and linked to each other could form a functional quantum network, or the system could gain a higher dimensionality by the use of structured ONFs with a series of nanoscale cavities each representing a node in the network. These and similar ideas still lack proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations, not to mention implementations in actual photonic devices.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nRepeatability of ONF fabrication should be improved by standardization and automation of the drawing process. Commercial fusion splicers solve the analogous problem related to joining telecom optical fibres; similarly, one could imagine an automated machine that allows the operator to reliably produce ONFs with desired parameters that are verifiable by in situ probing. On a larger scale, major engineering advances are needed for consolidation of the ONF-drawing technology with integrated photonics based on lithographic printing. Perhaps nanowaveguides similar in quality to ONFs could be produced by reflowing of printed structures, as is often done with on-chip whispering-gallery microcavities. Thus, the need for precise mechanical manipulation associated with drawing could be eliminated.\n\nState-of-the-art methods for structuring ONFs are based on nanomachining the fibre with a focussed beam of ions (gallium is more common, while helium offers contamination-free milling and a 10-fold higher resolution reaching 1 nm). These methods are expensive, low-throughput, and time-consuming, especially with the high chances of damage to the nanofibres during the process. A promising alternative could be to use micromachining (such as femtosecond laser writing, which has a wavelength-scale resolution) of the fibre and then to downsize the structured region in the radial direction by drawing (figure 7(a)), as is common for fabrication of photonic crystal fibres.\n\nTo improve heat dissipation of vacuum-clad ONFs, it is worth researching atomic-scale coatings. Carbon, with 1000-fold higher thermal conductivity compared to silica, is one excellent candidate. ONFs wrapped in graphene (e.g. via the Langmuir–Blodgett technique) would be a powerful tool for photonic and optoelectronic applications.\n\nTo control the guided modes in ONFs, one can structure the input beam, for which purpose the mode content at the waist region must be analyzed. This task is very challenging but feasible, for instance by spatial spectroscopy of beating modes [58]. We expect reliable mode control for ONFs to be achieved by merging this 'reading' capability with free-space holographic 'writing' (spatial modulation) and a machine-learning algorithm to link the two, see figure 7(b). An alternative strategy would be to structure the fibre itself and filter the modes by dichroism or resonant excitation.\n\nBesides the obvious approach of linking multiple ONFs, scalability of quantum systems based on trapped atoms can be pursued at the microscale, e.g. by combining an optical lattice (for localization and selective interfacing of qubits) with an ONF (for efficient channelling of the information-carrying photons), see figure 7(c).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nONFs offer a seamless connection between free-space beams and tightly confined evanescent fields, which brings optical trapping, manipulation, and probing of material objects to a new level of performance. After nearly two decades of research, nanofibres and their application potential are well understood and have been clearly demonstrated in numerous experimental studies, the foremost being optical trapping and probing of cold atoms in the pursuit of a nanofibre-based quantum network. Despite its advantages, ONF technology is still at the research-laboratory level, a long way from being implemented in commercial photonic instruments. In our opinion, the technology will only mature when the fabrication process and mode control become sufficiently accurate. Towards this goal, fabrication should incorporate in situ probing, whereas the issue with the modes could be overcome by combining holographic beam shaping in free space, mode analysis at the nanofibre waist, and machine learning to complete the feedback loop. We also envisage advances in chemically applied coatings to tackle the heat dissipation problem with vacuum-clad nanofibres, and more active implementation of micro- and nano-machining for precise structuring of the nanofibre and the guided fields. Advances in the next decade should showcase the true potential of these miniature devices.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by OIST Graduate University and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) Grant Number 19K05316, Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows Grant Number 18F1836, and an International Research Fellowship (Standard) P18367.\n\n5. Intracavity optical trapping\n\nFatemeh Kalantarifard1 and Parviz Elahi2\n\n1Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark\n\n2Physics Department, Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nStatus\n\nOptical trapping based on feedback has attracted considerable attention because of its unique and precise control on the position of the trapped particle, laser intensity, and the exerted force or torque. There have been various approaches used to take advantage of the feedback control. Feedback can be used to control enhancement: for example re-positioning of the trap by monitoring the particle's position and sending a fast electronic signal in force clamping [59]; stabilizing the sample stage and achieving power stability by monitoring the trap laser intensity with a photodetector and adjusting the laser power [60]. In addition, feedback can be exploited in a deliberate arrangement, where it is used as a mechanism for single-molecule trapping, anti-Brownian electrokinetics [61] and, recently, in near-field trapping in liquid medium, self-induced-back-action (SIBA) [62].\n\nAll the feedback mechanisms mentioned above are extrinsic: they all require dedicated electronics and imaging as a part of the feedback loop. In 2019, Kalantarifard et al [18] presented a novel technique of intracavity optical trapping (ICOT) and introduced an intrinsic nonlinear feedback force, i.e. a force that arises only because the optically trapped particle is placed inside a laser cavity (figure 8). The main novelty of ICOT lies in the identification of a new mechanism for trapping microparticles using intracavity optical feedback, which is fundamentally different from the standard techniques already demonstrated in the past. This technique is based on intracavity optical forces that emerge from the influence of the optically trapped particle on the laser cavity.\n\nAccording to the working principle shown in figure 8, there is an optomechanical coupling between the laser cavity and the trapped particle such that the particle's positions, r and z, and laser signal power, P, are correlated. When the particle moves to the right, left, and down, the power increases while, by lifting the particle up, the power drops.\n\nThe ICOT scheme works using an aspheric lens with a low numerical aperture (NA about 0.12 or less) compared to the standard optical tweezers that employ an objective with typically NA > 1 (in a liquid medium). Therefore, as the most important benefit, this new kind of optical tweezers permits trapping at lower average laser intensity than alternative techniques. In general, any feedback modulation of the laser beam intensity can reduce the intensity on average. However, the internal feedback due to the laser cavity dynamics occurs within the timescale of nanoseconds, making it several orders of magnitude faster than any external feedback.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nEmploying a low-NA lens instead of a high-NA objective lens in an ICOT system is one of the main advantages. Although the low-NA lens brings many advantages compared to the more costly high-NA objective, the weaker gradient force requires excellent adjustment and is accompanied by some challenges. Scattering loss of the trapped particle plays a significant role in ICOT systems. To take advantage of the feedback in the ICOT, the insertion loss of the laser cavity must be low, and the particle loss due to scattering should be significant. For small dielectric non-absorbing particles, where the particle size is much smaller than the wavelength (a ≪ λ) and the dipole approximation is valid, the power scattered by the particle in the trap rapidly decreases and the scattering loss in terms of the particle's displacement is much smaller than that of microparticles. Therefore, the nonlinear feedback that regulates intracavity trapping is negligible, and ICOT behaves as standard single-beam optical tweezers and cannot efficiently trap small particles at low intensity. This clearly shows that, while the intracavity feedback trapping is efficient at the microscale, it reduces to standard single-beam optical trapping at the nanoscale.\n\nDue to the use of a low-NA lens in ICOT, the particle weight plays an important role in the stability of the trap in the axial direction for trapping of the objects with a high refractive index. As a result, the setup design is limited to inverted microscopes for particles with very low density and a high refractive index, such as polystyrene. Depending on the particle's refractive index and density, the intracavity trapping needs to be designed accordingly. Therefore, trapping microscopic beads in a vacuum or in a horizontal configuration could be challenging.\n\nPosition detection, especially in the axial direction, can also become challenging to some extent. As a standard tool for position detection, a quadrant photodetector requires a stable and low fluctuation in laser power. However, because in ICOT, the intracavity laser power, and hence the output power, varies according to the particle's position, the high-resolution measurement of the position requires an understanding of the effect of power variation due to the position. Due to this complication, so far, the 3D tracking of the particle is mainly limited to 3D digital video microscopy, which is relatively slow as it is limited by the camera frame rate.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nThe advantage of optical feedback compared to electronic feedback is its uniquely high bandwidth (≈10 MHz). The novelty of this approach opens many new possibilities to be explored in future works.\n\nOne of these possibilities is to study systems where the characteristic timescales associated with the laser and the motion of the optically trapped particle become comparable. In particular, one can expect its uniquely high bandwidth to be crucial when dealing with particles trapped in the air or a vacuum.\n\nHowever, the ICOT in liquid can also, in principle, be scaled down to particles significantly smaller than the wavelength by changing the experimental parameters. A small innovative change in a fibre laser cavity [63] led to a new configuration called self-adjusted counter-propagating optical trapping with a single Gaussian beam and using an even smaller actual NA (0.087) that is capable of trapping smaller polystyrene particles compared to ICOT. In this scheme, the power at the sample switches between the signal and pump (which is now propagating in the opposite direction of the signal) such that, when the particle is in the centre of the trap, the laser signal power drops and the pump power rises, and this occurs automatically due to the displacement of the particle itself (figure 9). Having two self-adjusted counter-propagating beams improves the axial direction trap for smaller particles and brings another advantage to the trapping system in the horizontal design.\n\nAnother change, such as increasing the NA of the lens, would allow one to increase the losses due to the particle and therefore make ICOT more efficient. In another reconfiguration of the setup, the authors showed that by removing the isolator in the ring cavity, to make the light travel bidirectionally and then sending the light from both directions to the silica microparticle, the optical confinement per unit intensity is improved [64].\n\nIn terms of data acquisition and particle tracing, due to the advances in machine learning, particularly in image processing and deep learning, position detection and particle tracking in ICOT are no longer cumbersome, especially in the axial direction.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nICOT is fundamentally different from other techniques as it is based on nonlinear feedback forces arising because the particle is inside the laser cavity. Position clamping, for instance, works based on (external) feedback on the trap power depending on the explicit measurement of the particle position. However, in the ICOT scheme, the feedback is intrinsic to the laser cavity, passive, and extremely fast. In addition, due to the existence of an optomechanical coupling between the particle position and the laser cavity, the power is self-regulating, and it does not require recalibration each time that the experimental details are modified.\n\nThe ability of trapping to employ ultralow light intensity at the sample (enabled by the use of a very low-NA lens) in ICOT can yield advantages when dealing with biological samples that are sensitive to light intensity. In comparison with alternative trapping techniques, where a low-NA objective lens is employed [65, 66], the ICOT achieves excellent results capturing and trapping particles and yeast cells [18] by achieving a major reduction in optical intensity exposure at the sample.\n\nAs the working principle of the ICOT, being the trap inside a laser cavity has attracted attention [67] to a new research field that is curious to find out how a trapped object can influence the lasing operation and to discover what further exciting science discoveries and applications will be obtained.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is partially supported by Boğaziçi University Research Fund.

Metasurfaces for optical manipulation\n\nMikael Käll\n\nChalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nStatus\n\nAn optical metasurface is a dense 2D layer of scatterers with subwavelength dimensions and separations such that the layer appears locally homogeneous to an impinging electromagnetic field. The scatterers (or metaatoms) are typically designed to induce a specific phase and/or polarization state of the scattered field by utilizing optical resonances, such as localized surface plasmons in metallic metasurfaces (primarily Au) or geometrical resonances (Mie or waveguide modes) in metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric materials. By systematically varying the scatterer dimensions, shape, orientation and/or separation across the metasurface, it is then possible to shape the light that is transmitted through or reflected from the surface. This makes it possible to construct compact counterparts to a wide variety of classical refractive or reflective optical components [68], the prototypical example being a phase-gradient metasurface operating as a 'flat' lens [69], but also multifunctional devices and miniature structures with tailored optical responses.\n\nThere are so far only a few experimental studies of metasurfaces within the context of optical manipulation, most of them very recent. Polystyrene beads have been trapped using a reflective Si metasurface operating as a parabolic mirror [70] as well as by Si metalenses [71], where multifunctionality obtained by overlapping the phase gradients corresponding to a lens and a q-plate to transfer orbital angular momentum was also demonstrated. Si metalenses with NA ≈ 0.9 have recently been used to optically levitate SiO2 particles in vacuum, with trapping efficiency that is comparable with conventional microscope objectives [21]. These results demonstrate that lithographically produced metastructures can exert optical forces without the use of traditional optical elements. Microscopic SiO2 particles with embedded anisotropic Si metasurfaces that are able to deflect light at high angles to provide optical propulsion and torque were recently demonstrated [72]. These 'metavehicles' are steered by altering the polarization of a single incident plane wave and were able to transport microscopic cargo across a surface in water, see figure 10.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nSeveral challenges need to be tackled to make metaoptics a competitive alternative to traditional optical components used for optical manipulation. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nPoor efficiency and polychromaticity: most current metasurfaces have comparatively low transmission or reflection efficiency compared to ordinary focusing optics, in particular outside the design wavelength.\n\nPoor focusing ability: optical tweezing typically requires high NA optics, meaning that the corresponding metalens phase gradient needs to be very steep at the periphery of a lens.\n\nCostly and advanced manufacturing processes: metasurfaces are typically fabricated using expensive electron beam lithography and advanced layer deposition and etching protocols, which hampers their widespread application.\n\nComputational complexity: current electromagnetic solvers cannot simulate an entire phase-gradient metasurface, which typically contains >104 optically interacting metaatoms, in a self-consistent manner. This limits the possibility to optimize devices.\n\nTunability: metaoptics devices are typically static in nature, which is a clear disadvantage compared to, for example, spatial light modulators.\n\nThe challenges listed above are general to the metaoptics field. All are active areas of research, though each one may be more-or-less critical to the field of optical manipulation. For example, efficient high-NA metalenses are needed for laser-tweezing in 3D, but they do not necessarily need to be polychromatic. Apart from the important but obvious advantage of shrinking the size and cost of components used for optical manipulation, the most impactful challenge in the long term will be to realize applications that are useful but practically unachievable using conventional optics and photonics devices. For example, ultracompact systems for optical trapping in lab-on-a-chip applications would probably need to incorporate light source(s), metaoptics, and detectors to bring real advantages; metaparticles could be made responsive to environmental cues to act as mobile sensors driven by light; and metasurfaces with simultaneously optimized phase, amplitude and polarization responses could be used to create entirely novel optical force fields for diverse applications.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nSeveral technological advances, many already under development, can be expected to impact optical manipulation research and applications based on metasurfaces in the short to medium time frame, some of the most important being:\n\nMore precise and/or more cost-effective fabrication methods, such as extreme ultraviolet lithography and nanoimprint lithography.\n\nMore powerful optimization methods, including techniques based on artificial intelligence (e.g. deep learning) and, perhaps, even quantum computation.\n\nNew materials with lower loss, a higher refractive index, and/or with externally controllable optical properties (e.g. phase change materials).\n\nAdvancements based on combining metasurface concepts and technology with those developed in neighbouring areas, such as diffractive optics (see, e.g. [73]), nanolasers, optical sensors and actuators, and nanoantennas are also very likely.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe field of optical metasurfaces has developed into one of the most active research areas in fundamental and applied photonics. Building on foundations in plasmonics, metamaterials, and nanooptics, optical metasurfaces offer the prospect of extremely thin, compact, and multifunctional optical components and devices. These could be integrated into optical manipulation systems to drastically cut size, complexity, and cost, thereby accelerating their widespread use, and enabling new applications of such systems. Moreover, because of their potentially very small size and mass, metasurfaces could themselves be designed as targets for optical manipulation, thus realizing a new class of microscopic structures driven by optical forces. Due to the rapid advances of the field and the enormous flexibility in terms of possible metasurface designs, there is certainly room for both novel creative applications and further refinement of concepts and devices for optical manipulation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nTheory and simulation of optical forces\n\n7. Geometrical optics\n\nAgnese Callegari\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Gothenburg, 41296 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nStatus\n\nGeometrical optics was already known to the ancient Greeks. The most ancient surviving treaty on optics is Euclid's Catoptrics, written around 280 BC. Euclid writes that light travels in straight lines (rays) in homogeneous media. The law of reflection and the phenomenon of refraction were also known, and Hero of Alexandria demonstrated that, if we assume that the light always travels along the shortest path, we can derive the law of reflection using the laws of geometry. The modern formulation of geometrical optics stems from the works of Snell, Descartes, and Fermat. Later, geometrical optics was rederived within the framework of the general electromagnetic theory from Maxwell's equation [1].\n\nGeometrical optics' fundamental concept is the ray, which has a power P, a propagation direction and a polarization . The ray describes the light and its propagation through media. A homogeneous medium is characterized by its refractive index , which is related to the medium dielectric constant through the relation . The refractive index is, in general, a complex quantity: , where the real part defines the light speed in the medium , and the imaginary part is non-zero for absorbing materials only and dictates how fast the optical power of the ray exponentially decays in its spatial propagation through the medium. The three fundamental laws of geometrical optics consist of (i) rectilinear propagation of a light ray in homogeneous media, (ii) the law of reflection, and (iii) Snell's refraction law occurring at the interface of two homogeneous media: and . The intensity of the reflected and transmitted rays following a ray impinging on the surface between two media in Snell's law is based on Fresnel's coefficients, which are defined for each component ( parallel, perpendicular) of the ray polarization with respect to the plane of incidence. The Fresnel coefficients are derived from the electromagnetic theory by imposing the continuity conditions of the electric and magnetic fields (ruled by Maxwell's equations) at the interface between the two media [1]. Snell's law and the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor, which defines the energy and momentum carried by the light, are fundamental to explain the experimental evidence that light can apply forces to particles, which is the basis of optical tweezers [9, 74, 75].\n\nGeometrical optics has been successfully applied to model optical tweezers [9] and predicts the optical force applied on a dielectric particle [9] (figure 11). Geometrical optics is particularly useful in microscopic particles, whose size (in the range of few to several microns) is much larger than the wavelength of the trapping laser beam which, for visible light is in the range of 380–780 nm in vacuum (and consequently reduced by a factor n in homogeneous media).\n\nGeometrical optics has the limitation of not allowing one to predict effects related to the phase and spin of light, which are a peculiarity of the wave nature of light, because these features do not enter in the geometrical optics model. Despite this limitation, geometrical optics has been successfully employed to describe, for example, optical forces on cells [76], the deformation of microbubbles in an optical field [77], the optical lift effect, the emergence of negative optical forces [78], the forces on nonspherical particles [79, 80], Janus particles [81], absorbing particles [82], particles in a speckle light field [35], or trapped at a water–oil interface [83].\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nGeometrical optics provides an effective description of the interaction of light with matter and, in relation with optical tweezers, an intuitive and relatively simple explanation of the trapping mechanism. It is especially convenient in all the cases where the dimension of the particles is not small enough to allow full electromagnetic theory calculations. In fact, a complete electromagnetic theory calculation must include a number of terms that increase with the increasing size of the particle, and this might already become challenging in particles of few microns in size. However, geometrical optics does not provide only a 'fall-back' remedy, because it often captures the essence of the physical mechanism and provides an insightful picture without overwhelming non-essential details.\n\nGeometrical optics is a well-established technique that works well in most of the standard cases, where there are analytic formulas provided by the theory [74, 82] and for symmetric conditions, like a spherical particle, or a focused or uniform Gaussian beam, and counter-propagating beams. In the standard and non-standard cases, codes and toolbox are available [84–86], in different programming languages, with different possibilities for customization.\n\nAt present, the main challenges for the calculation of optical forces based on geometrical optics are related to the number of rays that are required to accurately calculate force and torque (or, in general, the scattering) on a particle in a nonsymmetric situation, which can be a rather time-consuming task, e.g. in complex particle geometries (nonspherical and/or nonconvex in shape, non-uniform in refractive index), or complex optical-field dependence (non-uniform optical field). In general, an accurate calculation of the optical torque on a particle requires a larger number of rays than the calculation of the optical force. If, moreover, we are required to calculate the dynamics of a nonspherical homogeneous dielectric particle, the force and the torque do not only depend on the particle position, but also on its orientation. When the particle is non-homogeneous in its refractive index, or it moves in a non-uniform optical field, the situation is made even worse: there is often no available analytic expression for the force and the torques, and a pre-calculation of forces and torques on a fine spatial grid for all the orientational degrees of freedom is a very daunting task and not a viable option. Even if pre-calculation were a possibility, in the case of a different value of the particle's radius or refractive index we would be forced to restart from the beginning. Also, depending on the circumstances, a grid of different sizes would be preferable, further complicating the pre-calculation task.\n\nAnother situation where the application of geometrical optics can be time-consuming is the case of optical binding and, in general, the situation where interactions of many particles introduce nonlinearity, and many-body calculations are required. A way to partially solve the speed problem in geometrical optics calculations could be to provide the toolboxes with the option of parallelization or to exploit the presence of a GPU. However, adapting or rewriting the code is not optimal from the point of view of becoming dependent from a specific hardware that might become obsolete. On the other hand, a machine learning approach is starting to be used in combination with geometrical optics [87].\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nThe parallelization of the ray scattering calculations and the exploitation of GPUs with ad-hoc adapted codes for geometrical optics could result in an increased calculation speed, but do not entirely solve the problem of the complexity and of having to repeat the scattering calculation several times.\n\nCurrently, a promising approach is offered by the application of machine-learning techniques. The fundamental idea behind the machine-learning approach to geometrical optics is that, once a network is trained to perform well for a certain set of parameters, then it can be used with a set of parameters that are in the range of the training parameters without re-training, even if the parameters do not match perfectly. Because of the intrinsic 'smoothness' of the transfer function that characterises the building blocks of a neural network, it is also possible to overcome the spurious discontinuities observed in geometrical optics calculations emerging in the case of grids with insufficient numbers of rays. Therefore, the computational effort seems to lay in the robust and smart training of the network. This would allow, in the future, the training of single neural networks which can accurately predict the optical forces and torques for a given general situation characterized by several parameter ranges, allowing faster calculation of the dynamics and statistical properties of optical systems.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nGeometrical optics is a well-known and established approach for effectively modelling optical tweezers and calculating optical forces and torques on microscopic particles in the ray optics approximation. Several analytic and computational tools are available, which give accurate results within a fast or moderate computational time. More complex cases (nonspherically symmetric, non-homogeneous particles, non-uniform and/or complex optical fields, nonlinear effects) require a longer and more complex computational approach and, in many such cases, the calculation speed is still a challenge. The introduction of the use of GPUs and parallelization could partially solve the challenges. The currently emerging machine-learning approaches seem promising by consistently addressing the challenge of computational speed, taking it away from the calculation and moving it upstream into the training process of the neural network.\n\n8. The dipole approximation\n\nManuel I Marqués\n\nDepartamento de Física de Materiales, IFIMAC & Instituto Nicolás Cabrera, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nStatus\n\nThe use of light (with wavelengths of several hundred nanometres) to manipulate a nanoparticle (with size of the order of the nanometre) can be analyzed using the single dipole approximation. In this approach, the optical interaction is directly obtained from the Lorentz force, and it is composed of two elements: the gradient force, proportional to the real part of a particle's polarizability and the gradient of the field's intensity, and the scattering force or radiation pressure, proportional to the imaginary part of the polarizability and the gradient of the field's phase [88]. In inhomogeneous spinning fields, the last force component, usually considered to be proportional to the Poynting vector, also depends on the value of the curl of the spin density of the light field [89].\n\nSlightly larger particles and high-refractive-index materials may also be modelled by considering a dipole approach but, in this case, the magnetic response must also be contemplated. Dual equations are obtained for the force on these particles, together with a new term coming from the electric–magnetic dipole interaction [90].\n\nThe knowledge of the mechanical response of these small particles is fundamental not just from the nanometric point of view. The force on larger particles or complex systems may be analyzed by studying the collective response of groups of electric dipoles, through the so-called discrete dipole approximation. In this case, the interaction among the dipoles is analyzed via a multiple scattering process, where the field on every particle is given by the incoming field and the field scattered from all the other dipoles.\n\nThus, the knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of electric dipoles in complex environments and under structured light fields is important, not just from a fundamental point of view, but also as a basic tool to analyze the optomechanical response of larger systems with huge applications in the fields of photonics and nanotechnology. Among these applications we may highlight the nanometric control of the diffusivity, the improvement of radiation pressure propelling systems, and the full control of binding at the nanoscale.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nAlthough the calculation of the force on an electric dipole is an analytically manageable problem, it still presents fundamental challenges like, for instance, the measurement of the Belinfante's curl force, coming from the non-homogeneous spinning nature of the electromagnetic radiation. Another type of spin force, coming from the interaction between the electric and magnetic dipoles, has recently been measured [91], but the detection of the curl of the spin force acting merely on a single dipole is still lacking.\n\nAnother challenge is the use of optical forces on electric dipoles to manipulate the diffusivity of nanoparticles using electromagnetic fields. These fields could be used to either increase the diffusivity or decrease it. Specifically, the challenge is to achieve active matter propelled by optical forces. Also, by attaching groups of nanoparticles to larger systems, a noticeable radiation pressure could be achieved, growing harmonically with the number of electric dipoles and lacking the mechanical stress induced by the torque expected at the anchor point [92].\n\nAnother future challenge consists of being able to manipulate the optical interaction among nanoparticles, with the final goal of either structuring larger and more complex structures or tuning the coagulation properties of colloids at the nanoscale.\n\nOptical forces on electric dipoles have also been proposed as a method for sorting different types of nanoparticles based on their mechanical response [93]. For example, a possible challenge is chirality sorting, based on the different optical forces felt by a particle with a non-scalar polarizability tensor when illuminated with circularly polarized light [94].\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nThe technical advances needed to achieve the above-mentioned challenges, using optical forces on dipoles, have been theoretically analyzed and, from those studies, several experimental setups have been proposed [36, 43, 95–99].\n\nGenuine forces coming from the spinning nature of the electromagnetic radiation and acting on a single electric dipole have been predicted, but never detected or gauged. Recently, an experimental setup to measure this force, proportional to the Belinfante momentum, has been proposed (figure 12). The experiment is based on the Kerker condition, a requirement subject to the coincidence between the electric and magnetic response of a particle. The setup operates at the Kretschmann configuration, using two counter-propagating transversal waves (TE–TM) with the same intensity. Dipole optical forces on this system are only given by the curl of the spin density of the light field acting on each single dipole (electric and magnetic) independently, and not by the force coming from the interaction between both dipoles.\n\nMeanwhile, to achieve full control of the diffusivity of nanoparticles, interfering light fields have been proposed. For example, a field consisting of two perpendicular stationary waves with tunable phases induces an optical vortex lattice. This vortex lattice can increase the diffusivity of the nanoparticles and induce collective motion. The radiation pressure forces appearing in the vortex lattice strongly increase the diffusion coefficient of an isolated particle and, when considering an ensemble of nanoparticles in a fluid, these optical forces may couple to the hydrodynamic forces, inducing a collective motion featuring ballistic superdiffusion [95]. Also, gradient traps may be used to decrease the diffusion. For example, speckles are a good option to tackle this challenge [36], using the value of the intensity as a trigger to reduce diffusion.\n\nThe manipulation at will of the equilibrium distance between two dipoles at the nanoscale, using optical forces, is also a challenge from a technological point of view. A possible solution is based on the use of the near-field binding (orders of magnitude larger than the usual far-field binding), tuning the equilibrium distance either by a periodic change in the polarization angle with respect to the axis joining both dipoles or by applying an external magnetic field [96].\n\nHowever, the technological proposals to achieve isotropic bonding are completely different and, in this case, fluctuating random electromagnetic fields must be generated. This technological problem could be tackled by using scattering of light on disordered systems [43]. Analytically, these fields have been proven to generate different types of isotropic interactions, including long-range forces [97]. As already mentioned, the control of these central forces, using isotropic fields, could be used to induce attractive or repulsive regimes, promoting or avoiding coagulation at the nanoscale.\n\nFinally, a new type of optical interactions has been predicted for dipoles with non-scalar polarizabilities, for instance, those found in nature for chiral particles. These types of polarizability tensorial-like responses could be artificially generated by a technology based on the magneto-optical response of some materials, like the n-doped polar semiconductor InSb. In these systems, the tensor properties of the polarizability are tuned by applying an external magnetic field. These 'artificially generated' tensorial dipoles also experience optical forces and torques that are strongly dependent on the spin and helicity of the electromagnetic field [98].\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn conclusion, the optical forces on nanoparticles with sizes much smaller than the radiation wavelength may be studied by considering the response of an electric dipole. Although they are analytically treatable, the results obtained from these small systems are far from trivial and turn out to be very useful when analysing the response of more complex systems. Among others, future applications of the force on these systems are the nanometric control of diffusion and coagulation, the design of building-up methods based on the control of the dipole's binding properties, and the propulsion or sorting induced by electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe present work has been supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MELODIA PGC2018-095777-B-C-22), the UAM-CAM Project (SI1/PJI/2019-00052), and through the 'María de Maeztu' Programme for Units of Excellence in R&D (CEX2018-000805-M).\n\n9. Generalized Lorenz-Mie theories for optical forces\n\nAntonio A R Neves1, Wendel L Moreira2, Adriana Fontes3 and Carlos L Cesar4,5,6\n\n1Centro de Ciências Naturais e Humanas, Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil\n\n2Tratamento de dados geofísicos, Tecnologia e processamento de geologia e geofísica, Exploração, Petrobras—Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\n3Departamento de Biofísica e Radiobiologia, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil\n\n4Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC), Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil\n\n5Instituto de Física 'Gleb Wataghin', Departamento de Eletrônica Quântica, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil\n\n6National Institute of Science and Technology on Photonics Applied to Cell Biology (INFABIC—IB and IFGW, UNICAMP), Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nStatus\n\nThe Lorenz–Mie scattering theory was presented in the early 20th century for an infinite plane wave incident beam, providing correct analytical results for an arbitrary particle size and refractive index. However, the concept of the plane wave is an idealization and cannot be achieved in reality; therefore, a generalization for an arbitrary incident beam was needed, which became known as the generalized Lorenz–Mie theory (GLMT) [100]. The GLMT is, therefore, an extension of the classical Lorenz–Mie theory, in which the solution is usually written in the form of an infinite series of partial wave terms for any type of incident beam.\n\nFrom the vast applications of the GLMT, here we will focus on its role in determining optical forces for arbitrary incident fields. Since the invention of optical tweezers, there has been a continuous and significant effort towards a complete description of optical trapping forces. Early models yielded a theoretical description for extreme ratios between the particle radius (a) to the wavelength (λ), either in the Rayleigh (a/λ ≪ 1) or geometrical optics regime (a/λ ≫ 1). To close this gap, a full electromagnetic solution was required and, since the GLMT used Maxwell's stress tensor to deal with mechanical effects of light, it became one of the formalisms for rigorous optical force calculations. The advances in optical trapping experiments, in which force components can be precisely measured, allowed a comparison with theoretical forces, refining the models used. Also, most reports now present their results in terms of the forces instead of the radiation pressure cross sections that were more common in the past.\n\nOne of the earliest applications of the GLMT to optical forces dates back to 1988, when the radiation pressure on a scatterer was determined from the reduced momentum of the Poynting vector [101]. The partial waves coefficients, also known as beam-shape coefficients (BSCs), were determined for a beam model introduced a decade earlier, developed to produce higher-order corrections of paraxial Gaussian beams [102]. This model showed a reasonable agreement with experimental trapping forces and trapping efficiencies values when using a mild focused beam. High numerical aperture (NA) objectives, however, are required for stable 3D trapping of particles, and these high NA beams were not correctly described by the higher-order correction. Although the initial beams were a solution of Maxwell equations (i.e. Maxwellian beams), this was not true for the higher-order corrected beam model. A non-Maxwellian beam resulted in radial coordinate-dependent BSCs. These strongly convergent beams needed to be adequately described by a proper beam model, a Maxwellian beam, and preferably with parameters that are accessible experimentally.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nTo validate the GLMT for the description of optical forces, it is necessary to obtain the BSCs of arbitrary beams and show that they correctly describe the incident beam. Moreover, the optical force predictions must be consistent with experimental results. Early experimental results measuring optical forces were obtained by balancing the optical forces with drag forces and determining the 'escape force'. These point-wise results showed good agreement with predictions from GLMT calculations for displacements within the particle radius [103]. Later methods were richer, yielding the optical force profile on the particle as a function of its displacement from the focused beam [104].\n\nThe challenge to find a proper beam model for optical tweezers, and an analytical method to solve the BSCs, was found and demonstrated by a series of experiments, which also detected the diffraction effects present in the high numerical beams, morphology-dependent resonances, and spherical aberration effects, described in a recent tutorial for optical forces [105]. As a result, the BSCs could be determined analytically from their definitions, and the same model and procedure has been successfully applied in other fields.\n\nToday, the GLMT is a mature framework used to describe the scattered wave by a symmetric scatterer for any type of Maxwellian beam. It has been successfully applied to investigate: trapping aggregates of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles; the trapping of metamaterials, such as negative refractive-index particles; stability of the trapped particle in terms of the switching rate in time-division multiplexing of the trapping beam; optical binding using a resonant cavity evanescent wave trap; microrheology of gaseous media, photophoretic forces in aerosols; the effect of polarization on trapping of chiral spheres; and switching photonic nanojets within optical traps.\n\nThe application of the GLMT has not been restricted to only highly focused Gaussian beams, but it has also been extended to other Maxwellian beams. An alternative and more general method to determine an analytical exact expression for the BSCs, using Fourier transform of the angular momentum operator, was demonstrated [106]. Different types of incident beams have been applied for optical trapping within the GLMT: zero-order Bessel beams; vortex Bessel beams; standing waves; Laguerre–Gaussian beams; Airy beams and arrays of Airy beams; optical stretchers; optical conveyors as long-ranged tractor beams; frozen waves providing localized stationary longitudinal fields; pulsed laser beams considering linear and nonlinear effects; and guided modes within hollow-core photonic crystal fibres.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nResearch is a never-ending story, and most models are always tweaked for the upcoming trapping application. A few issues are worth highlighting:\n\nThere are presently no analytical solutions to guided modes in hollow-core photonic crystal fibres, but to model the force within the GLMT an approximate mode model is used. We would expect an increase in experiments and simulations to validate guided mode models, possibly via optical forces.\n\nAnalytical force expressions for particles inside cavities or waveguides that only consider the cavity e-m modes without the particle are approximations of the real problem. How the presence of the particle changes the e-m fields and evanescent modes should be considered. We expect, therefore, a complete analysis of the external cavity—particle e-m fields to calculate the force without approximations.\n\nNear-field interactions are another growing area of spectroscopy, such as tip-enhanced Raman scattering, which will probably be used to trap particles.\n\nMost optical force experiments that displace the beam with respect to the trapped bead are achieving this by tilting the beam at the back-objective aperture. It would be suitable to see a model for the focused beam in terms of this tilt, which would result in the trap displacement near the focus.\n\nThe GLMT has been applied to symmetric objects, such as spheres, spheroids, and infinite cylinders, but if the correct boundary conditions are satisfied, or a superposition thereof, it would be possible to calculate the forces for other shaped objects yet to be determined.\n\nIn structured metamaterials, optically cloaked objects have been theoretically demonstrated using plane waves that are incident on the objects. Given the appropriate metamaterial and requirements for the stress tensor, a shaped beam could be rendered invisible and could also trap a cloaked object with the GLMT.\n\nA field where GLMT was timidly employed was in optical binding to form optical matter. It is a field with several recent and important advancements, most of which could be well modelled using the GLMT.\n\nIn summary future developments are hard to predict but, considering it as an extrapolation of the recent timeline, experiments would be more complex, aggregating other fields of research to optical trapping such as nonlinear optics, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and/or machine learning. However, the GLMT is a robust method to determine optical forces, which is currently unmatched.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nSince its birth, the GLMT has been used for a wide range of applications in optical trapping. Over the years, new beam models have been presented, as well as procedures for determining the BSCs. Recent developments in instrumentation for optical trapping, particle tracking, laser generation, and beam shaping, allow higher accuracy and finer tolerance for comparison between experimental results and optical force models, for which the GLMT holds great promise.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA F acknowledges the National Institute of Photonics (INFo) and CNPq.

T-matrix approach for optical forces\n\nRosalba Saija and Abir Saidi\n\nDipartimento di Scienze Matematiche e Informatiche, Scienze Fisiche e Scienze della Terra, Università di Messina, Messina, Italy\n\nStatus\n\nSince its formulation in the mid-60s, the transition matrix (T-matrix) method, summarized by Peter C. Waterman in his milestone paper dated 1971 [107], has become one of the most powerful, versatile, and popular techniques for a theoretical description of electromagnetic, acoustic, and elastodynamic scattering by particles and surfaces. The most recent attempt to outline the vast realm of this technique and its practical applications dates back to 2020, with a comprehensive publication database that includes more than 290 references, authored by Michael Mishchenko [108].\n\nThe T-matrix method is a complete wave-optical modelling of the particle–light interaction, recently extended to calculate the mechanical effects of light [109, 110] figure 13(a). It represents an ideal bridge between the dipole and the geometrical optics approximation, extreme cases of the classical theory of light scattering. It can be successfully applied in the intermediate range, when the scattering particle size is comparable with the light wavelength λ (x= 2πr/λ ≃ 1, where r is the radius of the particle). The T-matrix method has also proved to be a good approach when dealing with inhomogeneous particles and nonspherical particles that can be modelled as aggregates of spherical monomers.\n\nThe T-matrix method, also known as the null-field method and extended boundary conditions method, is based on the representation of the scattering function on the orthonormal basis of the spherical multipolar vectors that are solutions of the Maxwell equations. In this case, the scattering function, which is called the T-Matrix, acting on the amplitudes of the incident field, gives, as a result, the amplitudes of the scattered field. Among the different methods used to calculate the optical properties of model particles, in the near and far field, those based on the T-matrix are currently among the most accurate and efficient, particularly when applied to nonspherical particles composed of spherical constituents, i.e. clusters or aggregates of spheres, spheres with spherical (eccentric) inclusions, and multilayered spheres [111]. This technique takes into proper account the multiple scattering processes occurring among the spherical subunits composing the aggregate and the contribution coming from all the details of the model structure. The optical properties and mechanical effects of composite scatterers are analytically derived and can be exactly calculated without introducing any approximation, except the truncation of the expansion of the fields, thus being able to check the convergence of the results at every step.\n\nIn recent years, the T-Matrix method has been extended to the study of the mechanical effects of light in optical tweezers, where the incident radiation, modelled through the angular spectrum representation [112], consists of Gaussian beams [113], cylindrical vector beams [114], or Laguerre–Gauss beams [115].\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nAs outlined above, the T-matrix is a consolidated method that manages to describe, analytically and numerically, the interaction between radiation and micro- and nano-structured matter, possibly modelled as clusters or aggregates of spheres. Due to its high numerical accuracy, this approach is suitable for benchmark computations. However, some important issues of current interest may pose a challenge. First, advances in nanofabrication made available a novel class of materials and metamaterials with unprecedented optical properties [116]. Electromagnetic fields generated by such complex structures and metasurfaces can permit optomechanical spatial control of submicrometric particles or molecules. T-matrix methods can accurately determine the resulting optical forces by accounting for the full interaction between the surface and the interacting particles [117]. This is particularly interesting when considering optical forces applied to chiral particles [118] figure 13(b). Within this context, properly engineered metasurfaces can represent a breakthrough in the selection and sorting of nano- and micro-particles on the basis of their optical activity.\n\nRelated to the above considerations, a relevant improvement of the T-Matrix numerical tools concerns its applications for the inverse design of nanofabricated patterns or metasurfaces for optimal optical manipulation in the surface proximity. This improvement can be achieved by interfacing the force-field data obtained with T-matrix simulations with automated procedures based on the use of neural networks [87].\n\nAnother future challenge concerns the development of some specific theoretical tools that are able to improve the calculations and modelling of optical forces on cosmic dust grains with complex shapes and composition for applications of optical tweezers in space [119]. The relevance of these applications in space science lies not only in the possibility of an in-depth study of the chemical and physical properties of powders, but also in investigating the role played by cosmic powders on the composition of planetary atmospheres.\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nTo address the above challenges, using optical forces on micro- and nano-particles, a synergistic advance of the theoretical approach and of the experimental procedures is necessary.\n\nAs regards the study of the optical forces generated by metasurfaces, while the analytical approach based on the definition of the Maxwell stress tensor is complete and defined, providing, in a closed form, analytical expressions for transverse forces and radiation pressure, the numerical codes allowing their calculation must still be systematized. At the same time an improvement in the experimental methodologies capable of performing force measurements at the femtonewton order will be necessary. For this purpose, the force-detection technique used in optical tweezers has the required sensitivity and can be adapted for experiments.\n\nThe possibility of exploiting surface selection properties, based on the effect of optomechanical forces acting on nanoparticles with optical activity, pushes us to find a strategy based on artificial intelligence that can provide the best compromise in terms of sensitivity and ease of implementation. For this purpose, the convolutional neural networks seem to be the most advantageous choice and, in the near future, research in this field will focus on the design of this type of numerical protocols.\n\nFinally, the theoretical analysis for space science applications of optical trapping constitutes a test bed for the technologies that will be developed, and can serve to address the strategies for the realization of experimental equipment.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nSince their first introduction light scattering techniques based on the T-Matrix approach have found applications in a wide area of science and technology, in particular as a fundamental tool for optical trapping. Over the years, the scientific community has found answers to many questions concerning the theory of optical trapping of particles at the micro- and nano-scale, also in the presence of surfaces, both in the far and near field. With the recent advances in nanotechnologies, new challenges are arising related to new possibilities for the nanofabrication of complex surfaces and metamaterials that can open novel routes for optical manipulation.

A beam of light, described as an electromagnetic wave, can carry two different kinds of intrinsic AM. The first is connected to a spinning electric or magnetic field vector and is denoted as spin AM (SAM). The most prominent example of the SAM of light is circular polarization [120]. Unlike SAM, orbital AM (OAM) is a consequence of the spatial structure of a beam or field. It usually emerges as an azimuthal phase gradient around singular points [121]. A plethora of applications reflects the significance of both OAM and SAM. Their utilization as information carriers in classical or quantum communications or for the manipulation of microscopic matter via optical AM transfer are just two examples. For a beam of light, the total AM density can be expressed as the sum of spin and orbital constituents, i.e. , where corresponds to the SAM density and to the OAM density. The individual spin and orbital parts are defined via the electric and magnetic fields by\n\nwhere and are the vacuum permittivity and permeability, respectively, E and H are the electric and magnetic field vectors, is the angular frequency of light, and r is the position vector.\n\nHence, each of them comprises contributions by the electric and the magnetic field. One can easily see that for a circularly polarized plane wave propagating along the z-axis and described by its electric field vector , one obtains a position-independent non-zero longitudinal SAM density . In contrast, the OAM remains zero for an adequate choice of the coordinate system. Intrinsic optical OAM (independent of the coordinate system) arises in beams of light that possess a more intricate spatial structure. One prominent class of beams in this regard are the so-called Laguerre–Gaussian modes, solutions to the paraxial wave equation, which carry discrete values of OAM. If a particle is interacting with a focused beam that possesses AM, part of the AM might be transferred, resulting in a mechanical action. In conventional SAM or OAM, which is naturally aligned with the direction of propagation or the optical axis, either a spinning or orbiting motion of the particle about the optical axis has been observed experimentally [122]. However, it has been proposed that the orientation of AM is not restricted to be parallel or antiparallel to the optical axis [24, 123], opening new possibilities for the manipulation of 3D particle motion in an optical tweezers system.\n\nCurrent and future challenges\n\nApart from providing a great platform for the study of fundamental light–matter interactions, the dynamics of the medium, where a particle is optically trapped, can also be studied by optical momentum transfer [124]. The trapped particle then acts as a local sensor for, e.g. the local viscosity of the fluid. This is a huge advantage over other well-established non-local methods. However, in terms of rotational motion, the employment of light carrying only longitudinal AM may impose a severe restriction to such kinds of measurements. It would be thus highly desirable to transfer AM with an arbitrary orientation to trapped particles to enhance the potency of the aforementioned and many other techniques [123]. To achieve such full control over all rotational degrees of freedom of submicron-sized objects inside a simple optical trap, it is necessary to create a light field possessing not only longitudinal, but also transverse AM. Recently, it has been shown that upon tight focusing of light beams, a natural ingredient to optical tweezers, components of the SAM perpendicular to the direction of propagation arise [24, 123]. This effect occurs due to the superposition of out-of-phase transverse and longitudinal electric or magnetic field components [125]. Note that such a superposition does not take place for a collimated paraxial beam or plane wave, which are assumed to feature only transverse field components. Schematically, the longitudinal electric and/or magnetic field components that are necessary for the formation of transverse SAM result from the process of tight focusing because of a tilt of the wave vectors of the incoming beam towards the focal spot. The distinction and emergence of longitudinal and transverse SAM are schematically shown in figure 14. A spinning motion of the electric field vector about the direction of propagation results in longitudinal SAM (figure 14(a)), whereas transverse SAM is a consequence of a rotation of this vector around an axis perpendicular to the optical axis (figure 14(b)).\n\nAdvances in science and technology to meet challenges\n\nRecently, the utilization of transverse SAM in optical tweezers reached a new milestone. A trapped object was experimentally set in a spinning motion about an axis normal to the optical axis [126] following an earlier theoretical proposal [123]. The incoming field distribution consists, in principle, of two laterally displaced and circularly polarized Gaussian modes of opp"
