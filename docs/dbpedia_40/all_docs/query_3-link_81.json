        "text": "Nerve cells or neurons communicate with each other by releasing specific molecules in the gap between them, the synapses. The sending neuron passes on messages through packets of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are picked up by the receiving cell with the help of receptors on its surface. Neurons use different neurotransmitters to send different messages, but one of the most common ones is glutamate.\n\nThere are two families of glutamate receptors: ionotropic receptors, which can open or close ion channels in response to neurotransmitters and control the transmission of a signal, and metabotropic receptors, which are linked to a specific protein and control the strength of signal.\n\nOur understanding of these two receptor families comes from animals with backbones, known as vertebrates. But the receptors themselves are ancient. We can trace the first family back as far as bacteria and the second back to single-celled organisms like amoebas. Vertebrates have six classes of ionotropic and three classes of metabotropic glutamate receptor. But other multi-celled animals also have these receptors, so this picture may not be complete.\n\nHere, Ramos-Vicente et al. mapped all major lineages of animals to reveal the evolutionary history of these receptors to find out if the receptor families became more complicated as brain power increased. The results showed that the glutamate receptors found in vertebrates are only a fraction of all the types that exist. In fact, before present-day animal groups emerged, the part of the genome that holds the ionotropic receptor genes duplicated three times. This formed four receptor subfamilies, and our ancestors had all of them. Across the animal kingdom, there are ten, not six, classes of ionotropic receptors and there is an extra class of metabotropic receptors. But only two subfamilies of ionotropic and three out of four metabotropic receptor classes are still present in vertebrates today.\n\nThe current classification of glutamate receptors centers around vertebrates, ignoring other animals. But this new data could change that. A better knowledge of these new receptors could aid neuroscientists in better understanding the nervous system. And, using this technique to study other families of proteins could reveal more missing links in evolution.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35774.002\n\nGlutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of animals (Fonnum, 1984; Danbolt, 2001; Pascual-Anaya and D'Aniello, 2006). It acts on two families of structurally unrelated receptors: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), known as metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (Sobolevsky et al., 2009; Conn and Pin, 1997). While fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by iGluRs, metabotropic receptors modulate synaptic transmission strength. iGluRs are formed by four subunits, which can be traced back to bacteria (Tikhonov and Magazanik, 2009). The current classification of iGluR subunits includes six classes: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, Kainate receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (actually comprising three classes: NMDA1-3) and Delta receptors (Traynelis et al., 2010). iGluR subunits of the same class assemble into homo- or heterotetramers (Karakas and Furukawa, 2014; Kumar et al., 2011) and their ligand selectivity is dictated by a small number of residues located in the ligand-binding domain (Traynelis et al., 2010). Accordingly, NMDA subunits GluN1 and GluN3 as well as the Delta subunit GluD2 bind glycine and D-serine, while all subunits from the AMPA and Kainate classes bind glutamate (Traynelis et al., 2010; Kristensen et al., 2016). Metabotropic glutamate receptors are class C GPCRs and as such are formed by a single polypeptide. mGluRs also appeared before the emergence of metazoans, being present in unicellular organisms such as the amoeba Dictyostellium discoideum (Taniura et al., 2006). mGluRs are presently organized into three classes (I, II and III) and all their members respond to glutamate (Conn and Pin, 1997; Pin et al., 2003).\n\nWhile the phylogeny of the two families of GluRs is well characterized in vertebrates, that of the entire animal kingdom is only poorly understood. The few studies on iGluR evolution outside vertebrates concentrate on a few phyla, leaving many proteins unclassified (Greer et al., 2017; Brockie et al., 2001; Janovjak et al., 2011; Kenny and Dearden, 2013). Similarly, the vast majority of mGluRs described so far fall into the three classes described in vertebrates (Krishnan et al., 2013; Kucharski et al., 2007; Dillon et al., 2006). Although, the existence of three insect mGluRs that cluster apart from classes I-III led to propose the existence of a fourth class (Mitri et al., 2004). Here we present what to our knowledge is the most comprehensive phylogenetic study of ionotropic and metabotropic GluRs along the animal kingdom. We have favored the use of more slow-evolving species for the construction of phylogenetic trees. These species are particularly amenable to phylogenetics (Simakov et al., 2013; Simakov et al., 2015; Putnam et al., 2007) as they arguably present lower rates of molecular evolution than other organisms. Our work shows that metazoan evolution of GluRs is much more complex than previously thought. iGluRs present an overall organization into four subfamilies that were already present in the last ancestor of all metazoans. Vertebrate species only retain members of two of these subfamilies. Furthermore, we identify many lineage-specific gains, losses or expansions of GluR phylogenetic groups. Finally, we present experimental evidence showing that unreported GluRs found in the basally divergent chordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum (amphioxus) are highly expressed in the nervous system and that members of the unreported Epsilon subfamily, the most phylogenetically spread among unreported groups, can form functional ligand-gated ion channels.\n\nWe have performed what to our knowledge is the most comprehensive phylogenetic study of metazoan glutamate receptors. This has revealed that their evolutionary history is much more complex than what is currently acknowledged, especially for the family of iGluRs. Our study has also revealed the existence of unreported phylogenetic groups in both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Importantly, our data indicate that the evolution of glutamate receptors has not occurred in an unequivocal incremental manner only in those clades with more elaborated neural systems, but it has rather followed an scattered lineage-specific evolutionary history. This means that certain lineages have experienced the gain, loss, expansion or reduction of specific phylogenetic groups.\n\nOur phylogenetic analysis indicates that the family of iGluRs is actually divided into four unreported subfamilies that we have termed Lambda, Epsilon, NMDA and AKDF. Interestingly, this general organization was already present in the last common ancestor of all metazoans and later duplications within NMDA and AKDF subfamilies resulted in the formation of well-known iGluR classes. The other two subfamilies are absent from the majority of model species used in neuroscience research. The NMDA subfamily diversified into classes NMDA1-3 but also into the NMDA2/3 and NMDA-Cnidaria. Similarly, the AKDF subfamily diversified into the AMPA, Kainate and Delta classes, but also into the previously unreported Phi class. We have also identified and AKDF class exclusive to porifers, represented by sequences form O. carmela. Most well-studied iGluR classes are the result of duplications in ancestors of current bilateral species, >650 million years ago (mya) (Kumar et al., 2017), only class NMDA1 originated earlier, as cnidarians present members within this class. The Epsilon subfamily, which includes all iGluRs from ctenophores, is the only subfamily present in all non-bilateral phyla investigated, including sponges. It is thus the subfamily presenting a larger phylogenetic spread, as it is also present in hemichordates and in non-vertebrate chordates. On the other hand, the unreported Phi class shows a more restricted phylogenetic spread, as it is present only in three deuterostome phyla. Moreover, Lambda proteins seem restricted to Porifers, which constitutes an interesting evolutionary case due to maintenance of a glutamate receptor family in a phylum without nervous system.\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of metabotropic glutamate receptors has allowed us to unambiguously establish the existence of a sister group to the well-known classes I, II and III. Following the present nomenclature we have named this as class IV. This class had been previously proposed based on the identification of three insect mGluRs that did not cluster with members of known classes (Mitri et al., 2004). Here we show that class IV is not restricted to insects, but is actually present in all bilaterian phyla investigated, with the exception of vertebrates where this class has been lost. Interestingly, as it occurs for most well-known iGluR classes, mGluR classes I-IV appeared simultaneously in the ancestor of bilaterals. Our phylogenetic analysis also indicates that the non-bilateral phyla of cnidarians, placozoans and porifers present clear orthologues to classes I-IV, which are organized into four classes, while we failed to find any in the early-branching ctenophores. Finally, we were unable to confidently classify many non-bilateral mGluRs, which might constitute one or more classes.\n\nWe have identified many examples of lineage-specific evolutionary events. These would antagonize with a model in which species with less elaborated nervous systems would present GluR families with lower complexity. The most noticeable examples are: (i) the absence of all subfamilies but Epsilon in analyzed ctenophores, (ii) the loss of Delta receptors from arthropods, nematodes and annelid species investigated, (iii) the loss of the Epsilon subfamily in vertebrates, echinoderms and protostomes, (iv) the loss of the Phi class in vertebrates and studied protostomes, (v) the specific expansion of Kainate receptors in arthropods, which contrasts with the expansion of AMPA receptors in its sister lineages of mollusks and annelids, (vi) the large expansion of the Epsilon subfamily in ctenophores, placozoans and cephalochordates and, finally (vii) the loss of mGluR class IV in vertebrates.\n\nAlong the same line, it is interesting to note that amphioxus (B. belcheri and B. lanceolatum), with a simple nervous system, have over 20 genes encoding iGluRs, while mammals have 18. Other non-vertebrate species also present large numbers of iGluRs, including the 19 iGluRs identified in the sponge O. carmela or the 17 present in the ctenophore M. leidyi, to mention a few. Similarly, the cnidarian A. digitifera and the ctenophore M. leidyi have seven mGluRs each, while the placozoan T. adhaerens presents eleven, three more than the eight mGluRs found in the human genome. The large number of GluRs found in many non-vertebrate animals suggests that there has been an evolutionary trend to increase their number in many metazoan lineages.\n\nOur experimental results suggest that unreported receptors would play a role in the nervous system, as Epsilon, Phi and mGluR class IV genes are highly expressed in the nerve cord of amphioxus. Nevertheless, whether all these proteins are expressed at the synapse and act as neurotransmitter receptors is an issue that will require further investigation. Their presence in other tissues, such as sensory organs, cannot be ruled out. Those receptors showing more divergent sequences, particularly in residues involved in ligand binding, might respond to other molecules. For instance, they could behave as chemoreceptors, as it is the case of antennal receptors found in insects (Croset et al., 2010; Benton et al., 2009).\n\nProteins from all unreported groups generally present a good conservation of residues involved in binding the amino acid backbone, indicating that their ligand would be an amino acid or a closely related molecule. Interestingly, we could identify proteins predicted to bind either glycine or glutamate in all unreported iGluR subfamilies and classes. If our functional predictions are correct, the ability to recognize one or the other amino acid would have emerged repeatedly in all unreported iGluR phylogenetic groups. Unexpectedly, the nature of the residues conferring amino acid specificity indicates that only a minority of proteins from unreported GluR groups would respond to glutamate. Sequence analysis and structural considerations strongly suggest that class IV mGluRs will not bind glutamate and that among non-bilateral mGluRs only a minority, belonging to classes orthologous to I-II-III-IV, are predicted to bind to this neurotransmitter. Similarly, among unreported iGluR groups, the number of proteins binding glycine outnumbers those binding glutamate. Interestingly, we report a glycine-binding poriferan protein (GluL5_Oca) with a structural feature that had only been reported in ctenophores (Alberstein et al., 2015). This is an Arg653 that through establishing a salt bridge with Glu423 confers glycine specificity (Alberstein et al., 2015). We thus report that this structural element is not exclusive to ctenophores. We have also identified iGluR subunits with important changes in critical ligand binding residues, indicating that they might have evolved new biological functions, for example, response to other, as yet unidentified small molecules.\n\nThe activation of Epsilon receptors by glycine has been experimentally corroborated by electrophysiological analysis of homotetrameric receptors composed by GluE7 from M. leidy (Alberstein et al., 2015) and GluE1 from amphioxus (this study). In our hands the amphioxus receptor showed a very high selectivity for glycine, since ion currents could not be elicited by chemically related amino acids such as serine or alanine. Glycine-binding Epsilon subunits from phyla other than ctenophores present structural features similar to those from glycine-binding iGluRs in vertebrates. The greater number of glycine receptors found in non-vertebrate species could be related to the higher abundance of this amino acid in their nerve cord as compared with the mammalian brain (Pascual-Anaya and D'Aniello, 2006).\n\nAltogether, our phylogenetic analysis and experimental findings have uncovered the complex evolution of glutamate receptors within the metazoan kingdom. Our data indicate that the classification of iGluRs is not restricted to the six classes currently recognized. Instead, iGluRs are organized into four subfamilies: Lambda, Epsilon, NMDA and AKDF and ten classes with varying phylogenetic spread. With the data available, the NMDA subfamily is organized into classes NMDA1, NMDA 2, NMDA3, NMDA-Cnidaria and NMDA2/3, while subfamily AKDF contains classes AMPA, Kainate, Delta, Phi and AKDF-Oca. Both NMDA2/3 and AKDF-Oca are represented by sequences from only one species, further sequencing of non-bilateral species will be required to fully demonstrate their existence. Furthermore, the evolution of mGluRs has generated a sister group to classes I, II and III, class IV. We have also identified classes of non-bilaterian mGluRs orthologous to I-II-III-IV. We propose that the classification of these two families of GluRs, key to the physiology of the nervous system, has to be updated to include our findings."
