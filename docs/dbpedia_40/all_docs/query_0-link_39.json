His intention is to highlight its 'very diverse expressive potential, ranging from beautiful lyricism to considerable rhythmic vitality'. As Henley explains: 'although it has considerable lyrical potential, the piano is actually a percussive instrument'. The latter is particularly significant to him.' All three sonatas are shot through with an attractive blend of the percussive and the lyrical: No 3 is the most extended and ambitious scale, and with a correspondingly extended expressive range. The Suite was composed in 2002 to celebrate the eighth birthday of the composer's son; its five movements convey an engaging directness and simplicity in character and design. Framed by two cheerful Fanfares, there is a bouncy Scherzo, a warm hearted Nocturne and a dramatic Chorale. As with all Henley's music, it is effective but never loaded with complexity for its own sake. Sometimes touching, sometimes punchy, and often surprising, it is constructed skilfully with a distinctive ear for rhythmic zest and harmonic colour, allied to a natural gift for melodic charm.\n\n21 JULY 2023\n\nFauré: Requiem (version 1893) & Fauré / Messager: Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville\n\nLa Chapelle Royale / Philippe Herreweghe\n\nharmonia mundi HMM931292\n\nRelease: 21 July 2023\n\nIn 1988, Philippe Herreweghe and his musicians recorded a pioneering disc of Fauré's Requiem in its 1893 version. The French composer's masterpiece received an ideal interpretation, displaying restrained emotion alongside clarity and precision.\n\nJoseph Haydn: Cello Concertos\n\nJean-Guihen Queyras, cello; Freiburger Barockorchester / Petra Müllejans\n\nharmonia mundi HMM931816 (reissue)\n\nRelease: 21 July 2023\n\nIn 2004, Jean-Guihen Queyras and the Freiburger Barockorchester offered us a prodigious interpretation of Haydn's two cello concertos, coupled with a rare concerto by Georg Matthias Monn, a pioneer of the genre. A version now recognised as a landmark in the discography.\n\n14 JULY 2023\n\nYsaÿe: 6 Sonatas for Violin Solo, Op 27\n\nHilary Hahn, violin\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 14 July 2023\n\nEugène Ysaÿe, universally regarded as one of the foremost violinists of all time, was one such composer. Ysaÿe wrote six solo sonatas, which taken as a group mark one of his most ambitious compositional efforts. 'These sonatas are iconic, generation-defining and a beautiful celebration of the instrument' - Hilary Hahn\n\nKenneth Fuchs: Orchestral Works, Volume 1\n\nAdam Walker, flute; Sinfonia of London / John Wilson\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5296 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 14 July 2023\n\nKenneth Fuchs (born 1956) is without doubt one of American music's leading orchestral composers. His orchestral output has grown and developed to encompass a wide range of genres, from overtures and tone poems to suites and concertos (ten to date, including ones for string quartet, electric guitar, and piano, the last entitled Spiritualist), inspired by a diverse range of subjects, testimony to his wide sympathies and fields of knowledge. His output includes chamber music (including five string quartets), solos and duos, vocal and choral music, and four chamber musicals. Cloud Slant is a virtuoso orchestral concerto based on three canvasses by Helen Frankenthaler: Blue Fall (1966), Flood (1967), and Cloud Slant (1968) - not just musical depictions of them but also the composer's reactions to their artistic sweep and power. The flute was Fuchs' first instrument, so it was inevitable that he would compose a flute concerto. However, it was not until 2019 that he set about the task - for the flautist Peg Luke, to whom the concerto is dedicated. As is customary of compositions by this composer, the concerto carries a descriptive title, Solitary the Thrush, a reference to lines from Whitman's elegy for Abraham Lincoln, 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd'. Commissioned by the Californian Musique Sur La Mer Orchestras, Pacific Visions is scored for string orchestra, and is a single, dynamic movement sub-divided into five sections. Quiet in the Land, a Poem for Orchestra, is a revision of a chamber work which Fuchs composed in 2003, inspired by the rolling prairie of the Midwestern United States and the 'immense arching sky' under which it sits, cast against the impact of the Second Gulf War which had then recently broken out. The orchestral version heard here was composed in 2017 for the Phoenix Symphony. The album was recorded in Surround Sound, and is available as a Hybrid SACD and in Spatial Audio.\n\n7 JULY 2023\n\nWindows: Works for Trombone composed and conducted by Benjamin Ellin\n\nChristian Jones; Blair Sinclair, Joseph Alessi, Orchestra of Opera North / Benjamin Ellin\n\nMike Purton Recording MPR006\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nWindows is a unique album from award-winning British composer and conductor Benjamin Ellin. Uniting three of the world's leading trombonists: Joseph Alessi, Christian Jones and Blair Sinclair with the Orchestra of Opera North under the direction of Benjamin Ellin, Windows offers an intimate exploration of Ellin's music for trombone. This new release features two concerti, Pandora for tenor trombone and orchestra (soloist Joseph Alessi) and Gresley for bass trombone and orchestra (soloist Christian Jones). Also showcased are a standalone trio, 'Stow Sketches, and a kaleidoscopic world premiere for trombone trio and orchestra, Windows. The album was the brainchild of Christian and Benjamin following the world premiere of Gresley in 2021 with the Orchestra of Opera North: the first bass trombone concerto ever commissioned by a British orchestra. \"The reception after the performance was really positive, so the next logical step was to take the orchestra into the studio and record it alongside Benjamin's other outstanding trombone compositions. We wanted this album to challenge the many preconceptions about my 'endangered species' instrument and help to promote it as a dexterous solo voice in an ensemble\", explained Christian. Christian and Benjamin dreamed of this collaboration since meeting in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain in 1996, while the relationship between trombone legend Joseph Alessi and Benjamin began when he was awarded the Barlow Endowment Prize for Composition in 2009 and was commissioned to write a new concerto for Alessi. \"The two main concerti are different in genesis but both are based around the brilliance of the soloists I have been afforded the chance to work with\" stated Ellin. \"That alone, for any composer would be a dream, but to cleanse the musical palette on the album with the two trios was an absolute treat and I hope the audience really enjoy the journey.\"\n\nBrahms Piano Variations\n\nVladimir Feltsman, piano\n\nNimbus Records NI6418\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nBrahms wrote all his Variations for piano during the 1850s and early 1860s when he was in his twenties. Brahms Variations and Fugue on a theme by Handel was composed in 1861 and is seen as one of the greatest sets ever written, alongside Bach's Goldberg, and Beethoven's Diabelli Variations. Brahms order of Variations, changes between major and minor keys, the pianistic texture and style of writing were meticulously calculated, creating an impeccable design for his whole work. Pianist and conductor Vladimir Feltsman is one of the most versatile and constantly interesting musicians of our time. His vast repertoire includes music from the Baroque to twentieth century composers. Born in Moscow in 1952, Feltsman debuted with the Moscow Philharmonic at age eleven. From here he then went on to Moscow Tchaikovsky State Conservatory of music to study piano under Professor Jacob Flier. His American debut at Carnegie Hall, initially established him as a major pianist on the American and international scene. A dedicated educator of young musicians, Mr. Feltsman holds the distinguished Chair of Professor of Piano at the State University of New York, New Paltz and is a member of the piano faculty at the Mannes College of Music in New York City.\n\nFrench Music for two Pianos - Hahn, Koechlin, Tailleferre\n\nMartin Jones and Adrian Farmer\n\nNimbus Records NI5953 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nThe suite of Waltzes for two pianos (Le ruban dénoué) is the most substantial piece in this recorded collection and was written, as Hahn states, 'to starve of boredom'. It influenced a painting by American artist, Paul Cadmus and it has the same air of erotic promise and sensual movement as the piece. Hahns career started with song, and many of his best known songs were completed in his teenage years. He was also a prolific piano composer, and after the Great War he turned his attention towards Operetta and Chamber music. Koechlin experimented with unusual instruments and musical style, showing a range of compositions from lush impressionism of the piano suite, Les heures persanes, to the careful counterpoint of his chamber music and explosive magnificence of his orchestral, Hymne au Soleil. However, he is probably best known for his works based on Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. The eight works of Germaine Tailleferre, presented here encompass almost her entire career, from the Jeux de Plein Air pour deux pianos (1917) to the Choral et Variations (1979). Tailleferre often created her scores in a two-piano format before arranging or orchestrating them. Martin Jones is one of Britain's most highly regarded solo pianists since first coming to international attention in 1968 when he received the Dame Myra Hess Award. The same year he made his London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall and his New York debut at Carnegie Hall, and ever since has been in demand for recitals and concerto performances. He has made over 90 recordings with Nimbus Records exploring music that is not often played including the complete works of 18 composers. Adrian Farmer trained as an accompanist at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester following a music degree at Birmingham University. Adrian has made several recordings with other Nimbus artists: bass-baritone Shura Gehrman, pianists Nina Walker, Simon Callaghan, and Martin Jones. It is with soprano Charlotte de Rothschild that he has found his most enduring partnership and released premiere recordings. He has also created recordings with Roger Quilter and Cecil Armstrong Gibbs.\n\nRameau Re-Imagined\n\nEdward Higginbottom, organ; Holly Teague, soprano; Felix Higginbottom, percussion\n\nCRD Records CRD3543\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nThis programme is the Re-imagining of Rameau as Organist: not removing any works from the harpsichord repertory, but allowing some of them, arguably the more theatrical, to take on a new life and identity as organ music. The works in this collection have been taken mainly from Rameau's two major harpsichord collections - Pieces de clavecin 1724 and Nouvelles suites de pieces de clavecin 1729/30.\n\nDance Foldings - Augusta Read Thomas\n\nBBC National Orchestra of Wales / Vimbayi Kaziboni\n\nNimbus Records NI1579\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nIn celebration of the diversity and published objectives of the Royal Albert Hall on the occasion of the venue's 150th anniversary, BBC Radio 3 commissioned Dance Foldings for orchestra: the prompt was to reflect the arts and sciences as they are now. The natural world, explored by scientists, engineers, and physicians in laboratories and clinics, offers a wealth of opportunities to explore resonance and balance through sound. Few orchestral works attempt to capture the kinetic and emotional content of scientific topics and convey these concepts through abstract, rather than descriptive, music. The musical materials of Dance Foldings for orchestra take as their starting point the metaphors, pairings, counterpoints, foldings, forms, and images inspired by the biological \"ballet\" of proteins being assembled and folded in our bodies. Dance Foldings was recorded in the presence of the composer, and produced in association with BBC Radio 3 and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Augusta Read Thomas is one of the most active composers in the world, with commissions, performances, recordings, awards, and honours, but she is also a long-standing, exemplary citizen of the profession at large with an extensive and deeply committed history as a generous colleague in the profession. She is without question one of the best and most important composers of our time. Her music has substance, depth, and a sense of purpose. She has much to say and knows how to say it, and in a way that is intelligent yet appealing and sophisticated.\n\nAchtung, Aufnahme!! - A short opera by Wilhelm Grosz, and works BY Walter Goehr &\n\nMátyás Seiber\n\nEbony Band / Werner Herbers\n\nChannel Classics CCS46823\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nConductor, oboist and researcher Werner Herbers (1940-*) will leave behind a legacy of discovering, performing and recording works of 'forgotten' composers Werner Herbers has spent his life discovering, performing and recording works of 'forgotten' composers from the interwar period, many of whom had to flee from the Nazis or were killed in concentration camps. 'Achtung, Aufnahme!!' is the last album on which the Ebony Band will be heard. Over a period of thirty-two years, Werner Herbers and the Ebony Band have given over two hundred concerts around the world, promoting the compositions of that time: often absurdist, dadaistic, jazz-infused - styles and influences that the Nazis labelled as 'perverse'. The resulting archive of the Ebony Band's information and music is transferred to the Netherlands Music Institute in The Hague, where Werner Herbers' life's work will remain accessible for musicians, musicologists and programmers for generations to come. Werner Herbers hopes that the music of 'Grosz, Goehr and Seiber will be rediscovered, recorded, performed and enjoyed. Just like the other 125 composers from the interwar period whose 'lost' works I have dug up and archived over the past 50 years. Now that I won't be here for much longer, I am truly grateful to the Netherlands Music Institute in The Hague that they have taken on the responsibility to preserve my enormous archive, and keep it accessible to all.' All the pieces on this new album were written around 1930, have rarely been heard live and are first recordings: Achtung, Aufnahme!! by Wilhelm Grosz, Komödien in Europa by Walter Goehr, and Die vertauschten Manuskripte by Mátyás Seiber.\n\nShostakovich: Symphony No 14; Six Verses of Marina Tsvetayeva\n\nElizabeth Atherton, soprano; Jess Dandy, alto; Peter Rose, bass; BBC Philharmonic Orchestra / John Storgårds\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5310 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nJohn Storgårds and the BBC Philharmonic continue their survey of Shostakovich's late symphonies with this recoding of the Fourteenth, with Elizabeth Atherton and Peter Rose as soloists. Completed in the spring of 1969 and premièred later that year, the symphony is written for soprano, bass, and small string orchestra with percussion, comprising eleven linked settings of poems by four authors. Most of the poems deal with the theme of death, particularly that of unjust or early death, and indeed all four of the poets had died prematurely and / or in unnatural circumstances - Wilhelm Küchelbecker in Siberian exile for his part in the 1825 Decembrist uprising, Federico García Lorca assassinated during the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Rainer Maria Rilke of blood poisoning following an accident in 1926, and Guillaume Apollinaire in 1918 during the Spanish influenza pandemic. The Six Verses of Marina Tsvetayeva were composed in 1973, originally for contralto and piano, and subsequently arranged for chamber orchestra (the version we hear here, with Jess Dandy as soloist). The recording was made at Media City in Salford, Manchester, in Surround Sound, and is available as a hybrid SACD and in Spatial Audio.\n\nJoachim Mendelson / Grażyna Bacewicz: Chamber Works\n\nSilesian Quartet; Karolina Stalmachowska, oboe; Piotr Sałajczyk, piano\n\nChandos Records CHAN 20181\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nThe award-winning Silesian Quartet presents a new album featuring two composers from Warsaw - Joachim Mendelson and Grażyna Bacewicz. After completing his music studies in Warsaw and Berlin, Mendelson moved to Paris in 1929, where he joined the Association des Jeunes Musiciens Polonais, a society founded in 1926 to facilitate the study, publication, and promotion of the works of young Polish composers. Bacewicz also received support from the Association, and from Paderewski, and studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger. The association's aims included re-establishing a national musical life at the highest level back in Poland (after more than a century of joint occupation by Russia, Prussia, and Austria), and both composers returned to Warsaw and worked there until 1939. Mendelson taught at the Institute of Music, and Bacewicz became leader of the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra and continued her career as a composer and soloist. Mendelson was imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto until 1943 when he was murdered by the Gestapo. Five of his works survive, thanks to the French publisher Max Eschig, including the Quartet and Quintet recorded here. The two works by Bacewicz on this recording were rejected by the composer, and never included in her catalogue of works. It is extremely lucky that the manuscripts have survived, preserved at the National Library in Warsaw. Half a century after her death the Royal String Quartet prepared performing editions and gave the first performances.\n\nKarl Jenkins: One World\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 7 July 2023\n\nOne World deals with a fractured world and heralds a vision of a peaceful and egalitarian planet. On this album, the World Choir for Peace is joined by the World Orchestra for Peace and the Stay at Home Choir and uses texts from the Bible, the Hindu Gayatri Mantra as well as the poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Frances Harper, Kahlil Gibran, and Carol Barratt.\n\n1 JULY 2023\n\nLouis Couperin: Complete Harpsichord Music\n\nMassimo Berghella, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 96238 (5 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nLouis Couperin (1626-1661) has long been a fabled name among French keyboard composers. Born in the provinces in the late 1620s, he was 'discovered' by the visiting court harpsichordist Jacques Champion Chambonnières in about 1650; soon he had an appointment at court and was titulaire of the organ at St Gervais in Paris, founding the Couperin dynasty that included most prominently his nephew, François Couperin 'le grand'. Performers and listeners alike have long gravitated to Louis Couperin's music more than to that of any other member of the French keyboard school of the time, probably because of its fascinating and surprising harmonic language. There are 129 pieces catalogued as authentic. Among these, the unmeasured Preludes stand out as a kind of controlled improvisation in which Couperin gives us 16 examples of a genre that began life in the hands of the lutenists and now finds itself at the very peak of seventeenth century French harpsichord music. The Preludes present a sequence of semibreves devoid of indication, the only guide to the manner of performance being the positioning of the semibreves (in itself often confusing), and a complex system of elaborate and elegant slurring. They invite a rich decorative language, but scholars and performers alike must delve deep into Couperin's world in order to establish the grammar and vocabulary of that language. In making this new recording of all 129 pieces, Massimo Berghella has chosen to take the Preludes as starting points for 'suites' - 17 in all - which gather up the remaining dance movements into coherent sequences cast in the same key as the relevant Prelude. This produces suites of greatly differing length - the E minor has only four movements, for example, but the D minor has ten - but makes good sense along both seventeenth and 21st century lines. Among the most distinguished active Italian harpsichordists, Massimo Bergella studied with Kenneth Gilbert at the Mozarteum in Salzburg and at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena. He has a thirty-year-long career as a teacher himself, as well as a performance diary and discography that has taken him across Europe for recitals, broadcasts and recordings.\n\nMercadante: Music for Solo Flute\n\nLaura Trapani, transverse flute\n\nBrilliant Classics 96511\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nOperatic, early-Romantic fantasias for solo flute by one of the great names of Italian opera. Laura Trapani's previous album for Brilliant Classics brought wider renown for the sparkling flute-writing of Beethoven's pupil Ferdinand Ries. Now the Ferrara-based flautist turns her attention south to another overlooked figure of the early nineteenth century, Saverio Mercadante. Mercadante learnt the flute as a child and became a virtuoso on the instrument during his training in Naples while learning the craft of an opera composer which would bring him fame across Europe. One of his earliest successes for the stage was a ballet based on the legend of a magic flute - unrelated to Mozart's masonic tale - and from the 1820s onwards, audiences flocked to Mercadante's lyric dramas for their pacy drama, memorable tunes and arias that displayed the great singers of the age to best advantage. His Capricci also date from this early stage of his career. Comparable to the more celebrated caprices for violin by his elder contemporary Paganini, they are technical studies which stretch the technique of the most accomplished flautists, and they dazzle the ear with their lightning runs, filigree figurations and flourishes. The Capricci have received recordings from celebrated flautists, whereas the later Arie Variate have been relatively overlooked, and this release marks only their second recording, and the first to be made for CD. They are fantasies on popular operatic arias in the style of the piano pot-pourris and paraphrases which would be raised to an art-form by Franz Liszt a generation later. The chosen themes are mostly drawn from operas of the late 1810s such as Rossini's Armida and Elisabetta, Regina d'Inghilterra, but they range from Mozart's Don Giovanni to Mercadante's own Gabriella di Vergy of 1828. Laura Trapani thus restores to the catalogue a shining example of early Romantic instrumental virtuosity.\n\nFrench Cello Sonatas Vol 2 - Böellmann, Widor & d'Indy\n\nMarina Tarasova, cello; Ivan Sokolov, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 96821\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nLeon Böellmann (1862-1897) was born in the Alsatian town of Ensisheim. He moved to Paris after the Franco-Prussian War after which Alsace became part of Germany. In Paris, he studied organ, piano and composition at the Classical Music School, graduating from it with honors. After graduation, he worked as a teacher at school. His compositions brought him considerable recognition, and he would almost certainly have made a bigger name for himself if he had not died at the young age of thirty-five. Presented on this album is his remarkable Cello Sonata Op 40, hailing from the late French Romantic period. The Cello Sonata Op 80 in A major of 1907, by Charles-Marie Widor (1844-1937), is a grandiose work consisting of three movements with a magnificent introduction, foreshadowing a sonata full of ideas. When comparing the cello part with other sonatas of the period, a cellist feels that Widor cared little for technical constraints. Due in part to the use of huge intervals, the cello part matches the piano part for virtuosity. The sonata's premiere was given by Jules Lebeau and the composer on 14 March 1907 at the salon of Madame Max, who also offered Widor's Violin Sonata Op 79 in the same program. Vincent d'Indy (1851-1931) was a French composer and organist, conductor and teacher, music critic, publicist and meaningful public figure. He lived a long and active live throughout at least three epochs of French history. He is considered the greatest representative of the César Frank School of composition. His Sonata for Cello and Piano Op 84 was written in 1925 when d'Indy was over 70 years old. His style had undergone significant changes in the years following his retirement and move from Paris to the south of France, where he composed a series of works generally in a bright and cheerful mood. Despite its name, this Sonata in fact takes the form of a Baroque suite. The opening movement (Entrée) is elegant and charming. This is followed by a Gavotte in Rondo, in which pizzicato in the cello is used to evoke the lute. The third part (titled \"Air\") is characterized by a soft and melancholic mood. The finale (Gigue) is a lively updated form of this baroque dance.\n\nLuis Misón: The Five Sevillian Flute Sonatas\n\nRafael Ruibérriz de Torres, flute; Isabel Gómez-Serranillos, cello; Santiago Sampedro, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 96858\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nRecent scholarship on Luis Misón (Mataró, 1727-Madrid, 1766) demonstrates the growing interest among the musicological community in studying the life and work of one who is an essential composer in the history of Spanish music. Musical historiography has extolled Misón's contribution to the genre of the tonadilla escénica, a genre widely appreciated in his time and which must have had a notable influence on his instrumental music, about which less is known. His talent as a flautist was appreciated within the noble circle of the House of Alba, where musical academies were held in which Misón actively participated and for which he composed twelve sonatas for transverse flute and bass dedicated to the Duke of Alba. These pieces were located in the archives of the House of Alba and described in 1927 by José Subirá (1882-1980), but unfortunately they disappeared during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). The discovery of the five hitherto unknown Sonatas for Flute and Bass by Misón represents a substantial contribution to the Spanish chamber music repertoire of the second third of the eighteenth century for this instrument, given the scarcity of pieces written by Hispanic composers contemporary to Misón in which the flute is definitely the real protagonist. Moreover, they are sonatas which, from a technical point of view, pose interesting challenges to the flautist, something that highlights Misón's mastery of the flute, in accordance with surviving documentation of the period. Ortega explains that José Teixidor (c1751-c1811), vice-master of the Royal Chapel from 1778, considered his works to be no lesser than those of the best-known foreign composers and said of him that he was an unequalled performer on the transverse flute. The sonatas are found in five musical manuscripts preserved in the Lebrija Palace in Seville, a stately home dating from the sixteenth century, which in 1901 became the property of Regla Manjón y Mergelina (1851-1938), Countess of Lebrija. With regard to the sources, it seems unlikely that any of the five are autograph. (Although up to five different copyists have been identified, there is nothing to suggest that any of them could be Misón, himself.) Generally speaking, the sonatas are characterised by the importance of melody, regular phrases and steady rhythms, as can be seen in the elaborate seisillos of the Allegro moderato of the Sonata [No.3] in G major. Overall, the basso continuo line is simple - excepting the B section of the Allegro of the Sonata [No.4] in G major (undated) - allowing the role of the flute to stand out prominently. This recording is the culmination of a long process of recovery of Spanish eighteenth century musical heritage that deserves to be disseminated, studied and enhanced. After more than two centuries of silence, Misón's music is heard again.\n\nWilliam Byrd: My Ladye Nevells Booke\n\nPieter-Jan Belder, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 96887 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nThe only complete available recording of a landmark in Elizabethan keyboard music. With a huge catalogue of Brilliant Classics recordings to his credit, Pieter-Jan Belder has won particular praise for his ambitious project to record the complete Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (95915), a treasury of English keyboard music from the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean era. Now he focuses his attention on the greatest English composer of that age, with a volume dedicated to William Byrd, and to his largest single collection of music for the keyboard. Byrd's vocal works would have assured him a place in history as the greatest English composer of his generation. Yet he was also arguably the outstanding composer of his time in the realm of instrumental music - probably the first musician to achieve supreme stature simultaneously in music for voices, for instrumental consort, and for solo keyboard instruments. Though it has passed through the hands of many celebrated figures such as Elizabeth I herself, My Lady Nevells Booke has belonged continuously to members of the Nevill family since 1830, and has been kept at the family seat near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. When Christopher Hogwood made the first complete recording of its contents, he wrote that it 'occupies a unique and privileged position from the musical, musicological, chronological and calligraphic points of view.' The copying of the pieces was undertaken and completed in September 1591 by John Baldwin, a clerk at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and Lady Nevell's name was incorporated into the design of the cover as well as the pieces dedicated to her opening each of the volume's three main sections. The Lady Nevell in question was a generous, capable and cultivated woman who endowed a charitable school and an Oxford college. Like The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, My Ladye Nevells Booke embraces the most popular genres of its day. Its contents are typical fare for English Renaissance composers: dances, variation sets, marches, contrapuntal fantasies and programmatic pieces, and the repertory comes from a period beginning in the mid 1560s. Byrd makes each of these genres his own with consummate ingenuity; the variety and the beauty of the collection as a whole rewards players and listeners alike. The CD booklet contains an extensive essay on My Ladye Nevells Booke by Jon Baxendale, who is co-editor of the latest edition of the score.\n\nHummel: Piano Quintets Op 74 & 87\n\nNepomuk Fortepiano Quintet\n\nBrilliant Classics 96901\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nLively and colourful period-instrument accounts of pioneering works in the genre that later gave us masterpieces by Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. As a pupil of Mozart and contemporary of Beethoven, Hummel was esteemed for the elegance of both his playing and his music. His tone was clear and pure, his touch accurate, equal and refined, and Goethe is said to have remarked that 'Hummel handles the piano as Napoleon handles the world.' The opus numbers of these appealing quintets are misleading. The piano quintet had barely been invented as a genre - its principal forebears being the piano quartets of Mozart - when Hummel wrote this powerful E flat minor piece in 1802, later catalogued as Op.87 when he adapted it twenty years later for a piano with a larger range. Thus the piece itself belongs to his early period, much more Classical and Mozartian in manner than the powerful Op.74 which opens with a powerful D minor statement and continues in turbulent fashion as a work belonging to 1815, by which time the composer had achieved both fame and security. A quartet of Dutch string players, experienced in the early-music scene, forms the core of the Nepomuk quintet, named after the composer on this album; they are joined by the pianist Riko Fukuda, who contributes an authoritative essay on Hummel and his piano quintets to the booklet.\n\nHungarian Songs - Bartók, Kodály, Ligeti\n\nKatalin Károlyi, mezzo-soprano; Klára Würtz, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 96926\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nOnly one year and a half after their first meeting in Budapest in early 1905, Bartók and Kodály were eager to jointly publish their first settings of Hungarian folk songs. In their foreword to the volume Magyar népdalok (Hungarian Folk Songs), they declare their goal thus: '...to get the general public to know and appreciate folk songs.' The Ten Hungarian Folk Songs from 1906 (BB 43), Bartók's earliest and still quite rudimentary but imaginative and very sensitive folk-song arrangements, were collected by the 25-year-old himself mostly in three regions of the Hungarian countryside: near Budapest, Békéscsaba, and the lake Balaton. This set, from which we can listen to four arrangements on this CD, has never been offered by Bartók to be published. Having collected peasant music from regions of the Hungarian Kingdom where significant Romanian and Slovak minorities lived, Bartók immediately became intrigued by the peculiarities - and from his point of view, musical freshness - of both nations' songs and instrumental dances. His reverence for the folklore of the Slovaks can be felt in the five arrangements of the Falún (Village Scenes) series (BB 87a), composed in 1924 and based on folk songs from the Zólyom (in Slovakian: Zvolenská) region of what was then Upper Hungary (now Slovakia) he collected in 1917 from village women. These arrangements of bursting energy, enchantingly deep emotionality and transcendence also bear testimony to Bartók's discovery of Stravinsky's music which he was galvanised by in the early 1920s. The texts are sung by Katalin Károlyi in Hungarian here, not in their original Slovak-language version. Before leaving Hungary for Austria and West Germany after the fall of the 1956 revolution, György Ligeti (1923-2006) not only collected folk music in his native Transylvania but also worked for the Institute for Folklore in Bucharest and Kolozsvár in the late 1940s. Thus, in his twenties and thirties, he followed the footsteps of his idols, Bartók and Kodály. In the last months of 1952, Ligeti set to music five poems by János Arany, a leading figure of nineteenth century Hungarian poetry. Both text and music are deeply rooted in Hungarian folk songs; indeed, most of Ligeti's melodies, or parts thereof, could be actual folk songs, just like Arany's texts from almost a century earlier could be folk-song texts. The last piece is an exception, being a daring musical setting of Arany's 1868 Hungarian translation of Robert Burns' humorous song The Deil's Awa Wi' Th' Exciseman (1792).\n\nPietro & Prospero Castrucci: Sonatas for Violin and B C\n\nMarco Pedrona, violin; Davide Merello, organ\n\nBrilliant Classics 96945\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nElegant Baroque sonatas for violin and basso continuo by a pair of little-known brothers, Pietro and Prospero, who belonged to Handel's circle of talents in eighteenth century London. Pietro (1679-1752) and Prospero (1690-1760) Castrucci belong to the generation of virtuosos who connected the development of violin playing from Corelli to Tartini, and took the Italian style abroad, combining it with the latest musical fashions of the time. Born in Rome, they studied with Corelli, but moved to London in 1715, which had become a European capital for music primarily thanks to the patronage of the English aristocracy and the celebrity figure of Handel. The Castrucci brothers played in Handel's orchestra at the Royal Academy for the next twenty years, and Handel wrote obbligato parts for them in his operas. Prospero published only one collection, of six sonatas, in 1739; he seems to have been the more conservative of the two brothers, writing in a style reminiscent of his teacher Corelli, albeit decorated with bold flourishes characteristic of Veracini and Locatelli. The more innovative of the two was Pietro, who became more famous, wrote more prolifically and was published well beyond London. His violin writing is a crucible of invention, featuring bold strokes such as multi-tempo movements, arpeggiated chords on three strings, unisons with basso continuo, inverted mordents, and the kind of 'arco battuto' writing that Beethoven would later emulate. A pupil of Giuliano Carmignola, Marco Pedrona founded Ensemble Guidantus in 1995, specialising in music of the Italian Baroque. With them he has performed across Italy and further afield, giving highly praised performances of the canonic repertoire from Corelli to Pergolesi but also reviving many figures such as the Castrucci brothers.\n\nL'Orgue Soliste: Music for Organ & Orchestra - Bossi, Jongen, Poulenc\n\nTommaso Mazzoletti, organ; Helvetica Orchestra / Eugène Carmona\n\nBrilliant Classics 96955\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nWhen we think of a concerto for solo instrument and orchestra, the organ is certainly not the first instrument that comes to mind. And yet, the symphonic organ is perfectly adapted to the role of soloist, being capable of duelling as well as duetting with the orchestra. The Concerto for organ, strings, horns and timpani Op 100 by Marco Enrico Bossi, for example, is one of the most important and successful pieces in the entire repertoire, and yet it does not enjoy the recognition it deserves among the wider public. Structured in three movements of genuine expressive power, this is music that is both majestic and intimate, able to touch the hearts of listeners and performers alike - a work on which this great composer really lavished his extraordinary creativity. After reading through the score, Giuseppe Verdi was effusive in his praise for the Concerto Op 100, acknowledging the music's 'extremely bold and powerful effects'. His visionary genius is clearly displayed in the Concerto Op.100, whose solo part calls for a dynamic and symphonic organ that didn't yet exist in Italy at the time when he was a student but which he was probably already dreaming up. Hymne by Joseph Jongen is a real rarity. The organ has less of a 'solo' role than in the Bossi and Poulenc works; rather, it blends into the warm textures of the orchestra as an integral part of the sonic conversational flow so typical of Jongen's impressionist idiom. Here too, the composition of the Gland organ and its eminently full, warm and poetic sound are an ideal showcase for the mysterious atmosphere of this work. Unlike the Bossi and Jongen works, the Concerto for organ, strings and timpani by Francis Poulenc is very well known indeed. Uncharacteristically written in a single movement divided into seven sections, this concerto is surely one of the best-known organ works of the twentieth century. In certain sections the sonorous, weighty and deliberately strident organ writing is juxtaposed alongside orchestral textures that are extremely graceful and poetic, almost like a rough country giant trying to attract the attentions of a refined princess. At other moments, the organ imposes itself upon the orchestra, only to come together with it at other times, before proceeding to turn everything upside down once again.\n\nFabio Vacchi: Complete Music for Guitar\n\nAlberto Mesirca, guitar; Quartetto Manfredi; Daniele Ruggieri, flute; 'Flow My Dowland' Ensemble; Livia Rado, voice / Francesco Di Giorgio\n\nBrilliant Classics 96976\n\nRelease: 1 July 2023\n\nBorn in 1949, Fabio Vacchi stands among the pre-eminent Italian composers of his generation. Working primarily in the operatic field, he has had pieces staged at the Teatro alla Scala and by the Opéra Comique in Paris, the Opera de Lyon, the Maggio Musicale in Florence and the Teato Comunale in his home city of Bologna. Vacchi's instrumental pieces have attracted similar high-profile performances. His chamber cycle Luoghi Immaginari (1987-1992), has been given across the world, including at the Salzburg Mozarteum conducted by Daniel Harding. Other pieces were commissioned by Claudio Abbado and by the Tokyo Quartet. The most substantial piece on this new collection of his chamber pieces was commissioned by the Swedish guitarist Magnus Andersson and first performed by him in 1997 as a guitar concerto; this Quintetto Notturno Concertante dates from 2012 and is a masterful condensation of the complexities of the original, rich instrumental texture, while preserving its fleeing moods and subtly shifting changes of harmony. At the other end of this collection, Livia Rado sings Flow my Dowland, a rapturous transformation of five songs by the Elizabethan lutenist, in which the original vocal part is richly embroidered by Vacchi's own modern reimagination of the accompanying part, scored for a small ensemble of winds, strings, vibraphone and harp, to melting and magical effect. In between come a pair of solo works, though in fact Plynn quotes Britten's Nocturnal after John Dowland as a study of harmonics on the guitar, evoking its most dreamlike and insubstantial timbres. The earliest piece here is a Suite for flute and guitar, dating from 1971. Here, the 22-year-old Vacchi is at his most experimental in terms of both form and harmony, employing extraneous elements such as pen and paper and sending both instruments to the extremes of their register, though always with an intrinsically idiomatic sympathy. Any listener with an ear for the Italian postwar avant-garde will find this newly recorded album full of delight and discovery.\n\n30 JUNE 2023\n\nA Symphonic Celebration - Music from the Studio Ghibli Films of Hayao Miyazaki\n\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra / Joe Hisaishi\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 30 June 2023\n\nFor his first album on Deutsche Grammophon, Joe Hisaishi, the revered Japanese composer whose work has become synonymous with the magical Studio Ghibli, has created an exciting series of symphonic arrangements of his original soundtracks for such Ghibli classics as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and My Neighbor Totoro.\n\nEarthdrawn Skies\n\nAizuri Quartet\n\nAzica Records\n\nRelease: 30 June 2023\n\nThis highly anticipated second album explores deep connections between humankind and the natural world through the contrasting works of Hildegard von Bingen, Eleanor Alberga, Komitas Vardapet, and Jean Sibelius. Earthdrawn Skies will be the final album for the current formation of the Aizuri Quartet; violinists Emma Frucht and Miho Saegusa, violist Ayane Kozasa, and cellist Karen Ouzounian. Kozasa and Ouzounian have both announced that they'll be departing for new opportunities this year. Kozasa will be pursuing new creative projects in addition to her full-time viola professorship at Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music. Ouzounian will be focusing on her solo career, along with new interdisciplinary collaborative projects. Frucht and Saegusa will stay on with the Aizuri Quartet, performing first with a series of guest artists and selecting two new permanent members to be announced before the 2023-2024 season. Aizuri violinists Saegusa and Frucht said in a statement: 'We've treasured our time making music with Ayane and Karen over the last eleven years. Together, we realized the dream of starting and building a quartet from the ground up, and what wonderful adventures we've had! We thank them for being such invaluable partners and for bringing boundless creativity and energy to our quartet. Our work has allowed Aizuri to unlock incredible possibilities and bring new life to the concept of a string quartet. We're excited to nurture this legacy as we continue to grow and evolve in Aizuri's next chapter. It's bittersweet that our time with them is coming to an end - while we'll miss them dearly, we wish them all the best in their new journeys!' For Earthdrawn Skies, the Aizuris have infused personal associations and life experiences into four carefully selected pieces. While disparate in period and style, each composition is, in Ouzounian's words: 'rooted in a sense of tradition and connection to the land, even as the composers seek something beyond their reach: an understanding of God, the physics of the cosmos, homeland, happiness.' Von Bingen's Medieval chant Columba aspexit, composed in honor of Saint Maximin, has been adapted for string quartet in an arrangement commissioned by the Aizuris by Alex Fortes. Comprising a captivating series of solos, duets and trios, the arrangement culminates in an ecstatic, full-group unison. 'The four of us have often talked about 'singing through our instruments' and how the quartet is one organism,' Saegusa said. 'This piece presented us with a unique and challenging question, one we were excited to explore: how can we truly become one voice?' British-Jamaican composer Eleanor Alberga's contemporary String Quartet No 1 is composed as an exploration of the cosmos, drawing on the natural sciences. Rich with swirling and evocative textures and harmonies, her three-movement work launches us into space amid jaunty, jagged rhythms and melodies; evokes a star-filled sky with warm, contemplative passages; and returns us to earth with both energy and finality. 'There is so much depth to Alberga's music - the score encourages endless exploration and discovery,' Frucht said. 'We're so excited to be able to champion this work, and grateful to have had the opportunity to record it.' The celebrated Armenian priest, composer, choirmaster and ethnomusicologist Komitas Vardapet (1869-1935) is remembered as the 'savior' of Armenian music, collecting and transcribing great volumes of Armenian traditional music in addition to his many original compositions. The selection of his Armenian Folk Songs for this album reflects Ouzounian's heritage as a Toronto-born artist from a family that survived the 1915-1923 Armenian Genocide and immigrated to Canada in the 1980s during the Lebanese Civil War. For Ouzounian, Komitas' music was part of a tradition that 'brought us together and became an enduring, deeply treasured link to a distant homeland,' she said. 'The music of Komitas gave us a sense of our roots, our homes and lands from which we were displaced, the contours and nuances of our language, the warmth and sorrow and ebullience of our families, a link between those who perished and those who are living. Playing the music of Komitas with the Aizuri Quartet and sharing it with you gives voice to the unheard, and I hope it conveys the heart, the hope, and the love of my Armenian family.' The album's final selection, Sibelius's String Quartet in D Minor Op. 56, Voces Intimae, was written during a period of self-exile for the Finnish composer. Struggling to break free from his battle with alcoholism, Sibelius composed this unique work suffused with self-reflection and a striving to connect with his homeland and natural surroundings. For Kozasa, who immigrated to the United States from Japan as a child, 'this quartet feels like a rediscovery of identity - and this was something I could associate with growing up,' she said. 'As a Japanese kid living in Dallas and Chicago with yearly visits to a homeland that I had very vague and flickering memories of, I felt very attached to this recording that dared to reflect deep within itself and search for a new voice. For me, despite the hardships that come with migrating and never feeling like I quite fit in, on the flip side, I had the chance to become whoever I wanted to be, and this string quartet gifted me that superpower.' The Aizuri Quartet has established a unique position within today's musical landscape, infusing all of its music-making with infectious energy, joy, and warmth, cultivating curiosity in listeners, and inviting audiences into the concert experience through its innovative programming, and the depth and fire of its performances.\n\nBernard Herrmann: Suite from Wuthering Heights; Echoes for Strings\n\nKeri Fuge; Roderick Williams; Singapore Symphony Orchestra / Mario Venzago\n\nChandos Records CHSA 5337 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 30 June 2023\n\nBernard Herrmann is widely regarded as one of Hollywood's most important composers, responsible for more than fifty film scores (in addition to his work for TV, radio, and the concert hall), and noted for his collaborations with Orson Welles and, later, with Alfred Hitchcock. Welles was unofficially involved with Robert Stevenson's film of Jane Eyre in the 1940s, and it was Welles that suggested Herrmann as composer for the project. Herrmann became obsessed with all things Brontë, and within months was writing to friends of his plans to write an opera on Wuthering Heights. It took him eight years to complete the vocal score, using a libretto written by his wife, Lucille Fletcher. Although he conducted a recording of the work, in 1966, he failed to see a live production in his lifetime. Although the opera features eight solo roles, Cathy and Heathcliff dominate the action and are the only singers in Hans Sørensen's Suite of excerpts - recorded here for the very first time. Keri Fuge and Roderick Williams take the vocal roles in this recording. Echoes was composed in 1965 for string quartet, and was later arranged for string orchestra by Hans Sørensen - the version heard on this album. The recording was made in the Esplanade Concert Hall, Singapore in Surround Sound, and is available as a Hybrid SACD and in Spatial Audio.\n\n23 JUNE 2023\n\nMusic from the Ghetto: Ailenberg, Braun, Bruch, Shalit\n\nLondon Chamber Orchestra; Christopher Warren-Green, conductor; Simca Heled, conductor/cello; Jack Liebeck, violin\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD653\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nProjecting a multitude of emotions and feelings, this release is tied together by incorporating elements of Jewish music. Here, composers such as Max Bruch and Daniel Shalit integrate it with a Western European musical mainstream. Having conducted major orchestras all over the world, Christopher Warren-Green presents his latest recording with the London Chamber Orchestra whom he directs. In 2022 he celebrated a musical career as a violinist and conductor lasting fifty years.\n\nFlorence Price: Piano Concerto in One Movement; Symphony No 1 in E minor\n\nChineke! Orchestra; Jeneba Kanneh-Mason\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nIn the year of Florence Price's 70th anniversary, the Chineke! Orchestra and Jeneba Kanneh-Mason celebrate the composer's legacy with two of her landmark award-winning pieces which led to her major breakthroughs as a composer.\n\nMozart: Sonatas for Piano & Violin\n\nRenaud Capuçon, Kit Armstrong\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nThis box set of 16 Sonatas for Violin and Piano played by Renaud Capuçon and Kit Armstrong showcases the brilliance of Mozart's chamber music. Mozart's mastery of both instruments is evident in his compositions.\n\nThe First Songs of Travel - Vaughan Williams, Keel, Head, Stanford, Ireland, Mallinson, Davidson and Warlock\n\nRichard Standen, bass-baritone; Frederick Stone, piano\n\nAlbion Records ALBCD055\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nThis pioneering 1954 Westminster LP recital by Richard Standen (bass-baritone), accompanied by Frederick Stone (piano), has been remastered for Albion Records by Ronald Grames in excellent sound. This was the first recording of the (then) entire Songs of Travel and includes premiere recordings of five of the songs. We now know the full cycle of nine songs, but only eight of them were published in the composer's lifetime. The ninth song was not found until after the composer's death, some four years after this recording was made. Standen's performance of Songs of Travel was highly regarded by Vaughan Williams. Richard Standen lived from 1912 to 1987. He appeared on many recital and concert broadcasts on the BBC and soloed in the Bach passions under Vaughan Williams's baton. He was a popular soloist in choral festivals throughout Great Britain and the European continent during 25 years of active performing, as well as a popular song recitalist. For 20 years he was a well-regarded professor of voice at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, beginning in 1963. Frederick Stone is only known today as Kathleen Ferrier's accompanist on a frequently reissued recital disc, but he had a remarkable 30-year career as a staff accompanist for the BBC and appeared in hundreds of broadcasts with many of the great and near-great performers of his time. This release pays homage to an artist who, sadly now almost forgotten, should be much better known. In addition to Vaughan Williams, Head and Ireland were still living at the time the recording was made, and the recital included premiere recordings of Keel's Three Salt-Water Ballads as a cycle, and of Davidson's A Christmas Carol.\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel: L'Allegro, il penseroso ed il moderato\n\nLes Arts Florissants / William Christie\n\nharmonia mundi HAF8905359.60 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nUnveiled: Britten | Tippett | Gipps | Browne | Thomas\n\nElgan Llŷr Thomas, tenor; Iain Burnside, piano; Craig Ogden, guitar\n\nDelphian DCD34293\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nIn Jeremy Sams' new English-language singing version of Britten's Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the passionate sentiments are liberated from the safe historical distance of the Italian Renaissance and unveiled in a way that was not possible in 1940, when Britten wrote the cycle - his first for his partner Peter Pears. Tenor Elgan Llŷr Thomas presents it alongside Michael Tippett's equally ardent Songs for Achilles and a short item by W Denis Browne, a close friend of the poet Rupert Brooke, as well as first recordings of four Brooke settings by Ruth Gipps and a new song-cycle by Thomas himself, to poems by Andrew McMillan. Tackling themes of love, shame, acceptance, war and death, the programme traverses a history of male homosexuality from necessary discretion to the (relatively) liberated present.\n\nOrchestral Anthems: Elgar | Finzi | Dyson | Howells\n\nThe Choir of Merton College, Oxford; Britten Sinfonia / Benjamin Nicholas\n\nDelphian DCD34291\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nFor the Choir of Merton College, Oxford's first collaboration with Britten Sinfonia, Benjamin Nicholas has brought together a collection of sacred works from the first half of the twentieth century. A little-known fact is that these stalwarts of the English repertory were either originally intended to be heard with orchestra, or subsequently orchestrated by their composer or a close colleague. Written for enthronements, coronations and the nation's grandest choral festivals, these national 'standards' are here brought back to life in Delphian's largest recording to-date, their orchestral accompaniments affording them the richness, pomp and majesty associated with that epoch.\n\nA Left Coast - A Heartfelt Playlist for British Columbia\n\nTyler Duncan, baritone; Erika Switzer, piano\n\nBridge Records\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nIn a heartfelt playlist for their home of British Columbia, Duncan and Switzer share their fondness for the Vancouver communities, geography, and spirit that continue to nourish them as artists. In showing immense gratitude for Canada's West Coast new music scene, Duncan and Switzer have compiled songs written by friends and colleagues from University of British Columbia's School of Music: Stephen Chatman, Jean Coulthard, Iman Habibi, Melissa Hui, Jocelyn Morlock, and Leslie Uyeda. Drawing on themes of identity, self-knowledge, wonder, and nature, each work is an unapologetic romanticization and celebration of their Canadian home. At the core of the album is Jan Zwicky's poem Schumann: Fantasie, Op 17 set to music by Jeffrey Ryan in Everything Already Lost. The poem was written in response to Schumann's Romantic piano work, which was itself a response to Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte. Ryan describes the piece: 'Opening with a short fantasia based on the same Beethoven fragment that Schumann quoted, the song follows the Fantasie's structure and proportions, borrowing selected musical materials and expanding them in new directions to express memory, distance, and the fleetingness of moments together.' Additional tracks on the album include False Morning and The River-Lip by Iman Habibi, inspired by the quatrain poetry of Omar Khayyám, a medieval Persian polymath thought to have inspired mystic Sufi thinkers such as Rumi and Attar; Three Love Songs by Jean Coulthard, which sets to music poetry drawn from the 1948 collection 'The Ill-Tempered Lover' by her UBC colleague Louis MacKay; Something Like That by Stephen Chatman, written in 2010 for Duncan and Australia's pre-eminent chamber music ensemble Freshwater Trio; Plato's Angel by Leslie Uyeda, which sets to music four introspective poems by Canadian Poet Lorna Crozier; and Snowflakes by Melissa Hui, drawing on the ethereal and quiet essence of the poetry of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The album is dedicated to composer Jocelyn Morlock (1969-2023) who composed Involuntary Love Songs consisting of three points - Thaw, Matches, and Script - in love which is denied and hidden, and finally, eventually, acknowledged and embodied.\n\nNigel Clarke: The Prophecies of Merlin - Symphony for Violin and Orchestra\n\nPeter Sheppard Skaerved, violin; ORF Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra / Neil Thomson\n\nNaxos 8.579127\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nThe Brussels-based British composer Nigel Clarke is renowned for his virtuosic style, and an uncompromising contemporary musical language that speaks with an authentic voice to today's audiences. This world premiere recording of his symphony for violin and orchestra The Prophecies of Merlin is inspired by the twelfth century text De gestis Britonum by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and it casts the soloist as the maddened Merlin, either raging alone or caught up in the wild tumult of the orchestra. This score brims with rhythmic drive and bravura orchestration, juxtaposing savage musical outbursts with moments of sheer transcendental beauty.\n\nViolin Conversations - ichard Blackford, Howard Blake, Martin Butler, Wendy Hiscocks, Joseph Horovitz, Douglas Knehans, Kevin Malone, Thea Musgrave, Alan Rawsthorne, Errollyn Wallen\n\nMadeleine Mitchell, violin\n\nNaxos 8.574560\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nViolinist Madeleine Mitchell has inspired new works from a variety of composers, many of whom share connections of various kinds. 'Conversations' sit at the heart of an album in which four pianist composers join Mitchell to perform their works. The music ranges from Alan Rawsthorne's quicksilver 1958 Violin Sonata, heard here in a BBC broadcast to honour Mitchell's two-decade partnership with the late Andrew Ball, to Thea Musgrave's vivid Colloquy. The sequence of atmospheric, communicative pieces from contemporary composers explores natural phenomena, songs of freedom, telephonic frustration and a pas de deux love duet.\n\nKarol Kurpinski: Fantasy for String Quartet in C; Stanislaw Moniuszko: String Quartets Nos 1 and 2; Zygmunt Noskowski: Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Viotti\n\nLutoslawski Quartet\n\nNaxos 8.573978\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nProviding an overview of almost a century, this album reflects the aspirations of Polish nationalism through the works of three pivotal figures. Karol Kurpinski laid the foundations of a national style and his Fantasy for String Quartet is both serious and ingenious in design. Zygmunt Noskowski, considered the country's leading composer during the last decade of his life, was a mentor to future generations and crafted a witty piece on a theme of Viotti, including the use of a polacca. Stanislaw Moniuszko's quartets balance the hymnal with the rustic, being lively, unexpected and bracing.\n\nNapoleon Coste: Guitar Works, Vol 6 - Fantaisie symphonique; La Chasse des Sylphes; Grande Serenade; Le Depart\n\nAn Tran, guitar\n\nNaxos 8.574321\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nNaxos acknowledges the 140th anniversary of the death of Napoleon Coste in the year of 2023. The publication of a facsimile edition of Napoleon Coste's complete works in the 1980s brought the composer-guitarist's name before the public after decades of neglect. A student of Sor, he was the most eminent French guitarist of the nineteenth century and a creative innovator. Fantaisie symphonique shows the range of his ambition with its quasi-orchestral textures, swift mood changes and virtuoso flourishes. Le Depart is one his most popular extended pieces, full of liquid transitions. The other works demonstrate the variety of his art - the multitude of techniques employed, his mastery of texture and attractive intricacy.\n\nWind Band Classics - The Synthetists Revisited - Jules Strens, Marcel Poot, Francis de Bourguignon, Gaston Brenta, Theo Dejoncker, Maurice Shoemaker\n\nRoyal Band of the Belgian Air Force / Matty Cilissen\n\nNaxos 8.579135\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nIn September 1925, seven students gathered in Brussels to form the first composers' collective in Belgian music history - Les Synthetistes - who sought to distinguish themselves from late Romantic style by connecting with contemporary music. A lack of symphony orchestras in Belgium at the time saw them composing and transcribing original works for wind band, and through their collaboration with Arthur Prevost and the Band of the Belgian Guides, a unique canon of original, modern music could be heard on the Brussels concert stages during the interwar period. This recording provides a resounding response to the injustice of this repertoire's complete neglect today. Works by the collective's 'master' Paul Gilson and the seventh member, Rene Bernier, can be heard on the digital single 9.70351.\n\nMozart: Piano Concertos K 107s, K 175, K 336\n\nRobert Levin, piano; Academy of Ancient Music / Bojan Cicic (director & leader), Laurence Cummings\n\nAcademy of Ancient Music AAM042\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nAcademy of Ancient Music (AAM) continues a celebrated project to record Mozart's complete works for keyboard and orchestra, with this tenth volume of the series. Together with renowned scholar-pianist Robert Levin, and directed by Laurence Cummings and Bojan Cicic, AAM presents the Church Sonata. No. 17 alongside the Piano Concerto No. 5 - Mozart's first original keyboard concerto - both for orchestra and organ. The three K107 concertos are joined by a concerto movement from the music book of Mozart's sister, Nannerl, believed to have been drafted by Mozart as a young child, and completed here by Robert Levin. The hardback CD package is accompanied by comprehensive notes commissioned specially for the album.\n\nOscar Shumsky: Live at Berkeley - Bach, Beethoven, Prokofiev & Tartini\n\nOscar Shumsky, violin; Robin Sutherland, piano\n\nBiddulph Recordings 85030-2\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nOscar Shumsky is heard in a live concert given at Berkeley in 1982. Capturing the violinist at his prime in splendidly recorded sound, this recital features two major violin works Shumsky never recorded commercially: Beethoven's grand and passionate 'Kreutzer' Sonata and the Bach Partita in E minor realized by Alexander Siloti. Rounding off the program are several Kreisler gems, as well as a spectacular encore performance of the Preludium from Bach's E-major Partita.\n\nChopin: Ballades; Scherzi\n\nMarianna Shirinyan, piano\n\nOrchid Classics ORC100248\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nRenowned Armenian-born pianist Marianna Shirinyan performs some of Chopin's most fascinating and fiendish pieces: the four Ballades and four Scherzos. Chopin coined the term 'ballade', harking back to medieval minstrels singing poetic ballads. His four Ballades are quite different in character, but share a sense of Romantic story-telling in their dramatic contrasts and virtuoso display. The first three of Chopin's four Scherzos are fiery and dissonant; all four are exceptionally challenging. The Scherzo No. 1 is sometimes dubbed 'The Infernal Banquet' owing to its devilish character, which is juxtaposed with a central lullaby based on the Polish carol 'Sleep, little Jesus'. Schumann regarded Chopin's Scherzo No. 2 as Byronic in the grandeur of its passion, and the Scherzo No. 3 is also remarkably daring, with an almost Wagnerian chorale. Chopin's Scherzo No. 4 is the only one in a major key, yet its relatively serene nature, with fluid, whimsical twists and turns, also makes it one of the most demanding to play.\n\nBurnished Gold - Joseph Marx, Richard Strauss, Erich Korngold, Alban Berg, Johanna Muller-Hermann, Alma Mahler\n\nRobyn Allegra Parton, soprano; Simon Lepper, piano\n\nOrchid Classics ORC100228\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nSoprano Robyn Allegra Parton and pianist Simon Lepper perform an album inspired by the burnished gold leaf and sensual contours of Klimt's Art-Nouveau 'Vienna Secession' movement, with music reflecting that aesthetic including songs by Richard Strauss, Alma Mahler, Johanna Muller-Hermann, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Alban Berg and Joseph Marx - a composer about whom Lepper recently curated a series at Wigmore Hall. These are works that occupy a fascinating realm between the romantic and the modern, so that sensuous, brooding and dark-hued atmospheres are blended with rich textures and radiant harmonies. Described by Opernwelt as 'captivating, astonishing, overwhelming', award-winning British soprano Robyn Allegra Parton specialises in this repertoire, and Simon Lepper is one of the finest song accompanists in the world.\n\nGeorge Gershwin: An American in Paris; Lullaby; Promenade; Cuban Overture; Catfish Row\n\nJohn Korman, Yuan Tung, George Silfies, Barbara Liberman, David Mortland, St Louis Symphony Orchestra / Leonard Slatkin\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3019CD\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nSoon after writing his great works for piano and orchestra, Gershwin turned to his 'tone poem for orchestra', An American in Paris. With indelible themes, and masterly string writing, it remains one of his best-known works. Gershwin's Rumba for orchestra, the vivacious Cuban Overture, was inspired by a visit to Havana. A few years later Porgy and Bess opened to mixed reviews in New York and Gershwin hoped to salvage some of the music in a suite that, when it was rediscovered in 1958 by Ira Gershwin, was called Catfish Row. These classic Vox recordings from 1974, performed by Leonard Slatkin with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra, are newly remastered in high definition from the original master tapes. The Elite Recordings for Vox by legendary producers Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz are considered by audiophiles to be amongst the finest sounding examples of orchestral recordings.\n\nTchaikovsky: Symphony No 4; Romeo and Juliet\n\nUtah Symphony Orchestra / Maurice Abravanel\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3022CD\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nIt was with the Fourth Symphony, a work of radical conception, that Tchaikovsky came into his own as a symphonist. Written during the turmoil of his catastrophic marriage, the work is dominated by a Fate motif symbolising the 'inexorable power that hampers our search for happiness'. The wildly popular fantasy overture after Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, is captivating and poignant, and one of the composer's most loved works. These classic Vox recordings by the Utah Symphony Orchestra were originally released in 1974, and remain much admired to this day for conductor Maurice Abravanel's fresh and direct interpretations. The Elite Recordings for Vox by legendary producers Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz are considered by audiophiles to be amongst the finest sounding examples of orchestral recordings.\n\nA Left Coast - Iman Habibi, Jean Coulthard, Jocelyn Morlock, Stephen Chatman, Leslie Uyeda, Melissa Hui, Jeffrey Ryan\n\nTyler Duncan, baritone; Erika Switzer, piano\n\nBridge Records BRIDGE9574\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nA Left Coast is a heartfelt song collection for the place baritone Tyler Duncan and pianist Erika Switzer call home - British Columbia. The distinguished artists write: 'Our particular connections to Vancouver's communities, geography, and spirit, continue to nourish us as artists. Its lands and waters, the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory cared for since time immemorial by the Musqueam, Squamish, and Selilwitulh and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, provided us with an extraordinary upbringing. With these songs, (by composers Iman Habibi, Jean Coulthard, Jocelyn Morlock, Stephen Chatman, Leslie Uyeda, Melissa Hui, and Jeffrey Ryan) we wish to say thank you.' Duncan and Switzer have been inspired by the vibrant Canadian new music scene, and offer an adventurous, deeply felt homage to Canada's beautiful 'left coast.'\n\nPatientia - Philip Glass: Violin Concerto No 2; Kjetil Bjerkestrand: Fiolinkonsert Nr 1 'Patientia'\n\nSara Övinge, violin; Norwegian Chamber Orchestra / Edward Gardner\n\nLAWO Classics LWC1255\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nGlass' Violin Concerto No. 2 was premiered in 2009 in Toronto by violinist Robert McDuffie, for whom the work was composed, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra under conductor Peter Oundjian. Although conceived as a companion piece to Vivaldi's Four Seasons, after years of to and fro between McDuffie and Glass, it emerged that their interpretations of the seasons were greatly different. This was the reason Glass chose to present his Four Seasons as an opportunity for listeners to make their own interpretation, therefore the titles of the movements offer no clues as to where Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter might fall. Kjetil Bjerkestrand draws on from a wide range of musical styles, from rock and pop to contemporary classical styles. He describes the composition process as one part search for fixation points in a series of possible events, and one part exploration of friction caused by the 'union of the elastic and the mechanical'. Harmonically, he often starts with Messiaen's third mode of limited transposition. Starting on C this would be C-D-Eb-E-F#-G-Ab-Bb-B. There are three identical movements from each major third, C, E and Ab, which are also the only notes that appear in all three possible modulations. From this he derives three-chord sequences, with a penchant for triads, which he then stacks according to his desire and need to fill the soundscape. However technical this may sound, Kjetil manages to distill a music of his own which seems both familiar and foreign; instantaneous, yet profound.\n\nMichel Pignolet de Montéclair - Concerts pour la flûte traversière avec la basse chiffrée\n\nThe Opus Project: Joanna Marsden, baroque flute; Christophe Gauthier, harpsichord; Margaret Little, viola da gamba; Daniel Zuluaga, theorbo, guitar\n\nNavona Records NV6533\n\nRelease: 23 June 2023\n\nCelebrated Montréal flutist Joanna Marsden explores the work of eighteenth century French composer Michel Pignolet de Montéclair on Montéclair Concerts for Baroque Flute from Navona Records. The performances feature The Opus Project, a chamber music initiative founded by Marsden and Christophe Gauthier dedicated to revisiting early musical prints and manuscript sources in order to celebrate the unsung treasures of baroque chamber music. The 'concerts' of Montéclair reconcile Italian virtuosity and complexity with French expressive language, exploring a variety of national styles to which he was exposed during his time working in Milan. Orchestrated with flute, viola da gamba, harpsichord and theorbo, The Opus Project gives new life to these centuries-old compositions for modern audiences.\n\n17 JUNE 2023\n\nGuacamaya: Songs and Chamber Music from Mexico\n\nJamie MacDougall tenor; Mr McFall's Chamber\n\nDelphian DCD34286\n\nRelease: 17 June 2023\n\nConfessing to a thirty-year love affair with the music of Mexico, Scottish tenor Jamie MacDougall enthusiastically joins forces with Delphian regulars Mr McFall's Chamber, whose involvement in Latin American music goes back nearly as far. The resulting album of songs and chamber music covers the whole of the twentieth century, charting a journey through nationalist, modernist, folk and Aztec influences to the work of Arturo Márquez and Javier Álvarez, two of the most prominent and successful composers in Mexico today. At the heart of the programme are the classic songs whose writers grew up in the drawing-room culture as well as the bars and brothels of turn-of-the-century Mexico, a repertoire MacDougall reckons the equal of the American Songbook, that should be much better known and more widely heard.\n\n16 JUNE 2023\n\nPendant World\n\nBalmorhea\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nn Pendant World, Balmorhea are joined by jazz saxophonist Sam Gendel, violinist and vocalist Aisha Burns, and cellist Clarice Jensen, plus a distinguished line-up of guest artists, including composer and percussionist Jason Treuting, vocalists Steph Jenkins and Lisa Morgenstern, clarinetist Jonathan Sielaff, and Joseph Shabason on tenor saxophone and flute.\n\nL(oo)ping\n\nRone; National Orchestra of Lyon\n\nInFiné Music\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nElectronic producer Rone has had a long and illustrious career, collaborating with France's most distinguished contemporary minds - the likes of writer Alain Damasio, Marseilles Ballet group, (LA)HORDE and film directors Jacques Audiard and Spike Jonze. His upcoming album L(oo)ping sees him enter into another exciting collaboration, this time with the National Orchestra of Lyon. On the album, Rone pushes his dazzling acrobatics further with music that twirls and twists alongside the orchestra under maestro's Dirk Brossé baton. \"It has been an exhilarating sensation to prepare for these vertiginous acrobatics in a world completely foreign to me. My machines become one with the National Orchestra of Lyon as I weightlessly loop and twirl under the baton of maestro Dirk Brossé' - Rone. The eleven pieces chosen, with the help of composer and arranger, Romain Allender, each mark a different stage in Rone's trajectory, from one of his first-ever productions, Bora, born in a studio flat in Paris in 2008 when he was still a student, all the way to the soundtrack composed for the 2022 short-film, Ghosts, directed and performed by (LA)HORDE. L(oo)ping isn't just an orchestral re-telling of Rone's work, however. New life has been breathed into the music through Allendar's arrangements as well as Rone's own interaction with the National Orchestra of Lyon, 'Sometimes I felt that the musicians were very controlled. It was important for me to inspire and encourage them to move freely within the given frames, to improvise and to feel their own power within these musical pieces as well as add their own spices to it', he says.\n\nEmmanuel Despax - Après un rêve\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD747\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nThis disc comprises a new arrangement of Fauré's song, Après un rêve, by Emmanuel Despax, alongside gems from the French song tradition by Poulenc, Debussy, Saint-Saëns, Chaminade, Ravel and Duparc. This album, the title of which translates to 'After a dream', is attributed to Despax's grandfather - Jacques Charpentreau - a poet who drew inspiration from night in his works. Emmanuel Despax is one of the most celebrated pianists working today with a string of critically acclaimed recordings with major orchestras and ensembles. He has toured across the globe and in the UK enjoyed engagements with the likes of the BBC, BBC Scottish and City of Birmingham symphony orchestras.\n\nMaurice Ravel: L'Heure espagnole, Bolero\n\nLes Siècles / François-Xavier Roth\n\nharmonia mundi HMM905361\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nContinuing their exploration of Ravel's output, François-Xavier Roth and Les Siècles offer us two works linked by his love of Spain. Alongside the famous Bolero, which regains its original flavour here on period instruments, is Ravel's first opera, which flirted with libertinism: though its outstanding cast consists entirely of native French-speakers, this caustic 'Hour' remains quintessentially Spanish.\n\nPoulenc; R Schumann; C Chaminade (Foundation Gautier Capuçon)\n\nMartina Consonni, Sarah Jégou-Sageman, Jeein You\n\nErato\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nCellist Gautier Capuçon, through the Foundation he established last year, presents three outstanding young musicians: the Italian pianist Martina Consonni, the French violinist Sarah Jégou-Sageman, and the South Korean cellist Jeein You. Consonni performs Robert Schumann's Papillons, joining Jégou-Sageman for Schumann's Sonata No 1 for Violin and Piano, and You for Poulenc's Sonata for Cello and Piano. All three musicians come together for Cécile Chaminade's Piano Trio No 1.\n\nA brief nostalgia\n\nMatteo Myderwyk\n\nWarner Classics 5419748177\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nTwo years after Matteo Myderwyk's successful label debut, he releases A brief nostalgia: twelve new tracks composed for various pianos, harmonium, organ, church organ, synthesizers and drum computers. In the relaxing and distinctive soundworld of this Dutch composer's music, the tracks reflect on his childhood, the church organ he played, the pop songs of his adolescence, his favourite films, and other memories.\n\nSerenade\n\nLiuke Cissell\n\nSilver Squid Music\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nInnovative composer and multi-instrumentalist Luke Cissell announces the upcoming release of Serenade, an album of two new works for string orchestra. The eponymous Serenade for Strings is a monumental five-movement work that showcases Cissell's visionary style and musicianship through his dazzling blend of post-Romanticism, Old Time fiddle, fugue, dreampop, and other genre-defying sounds. Brimming with energy and a sublime mysticism, Serenade for Strings is a stirring contemporary take on a classic form (the title of the piece recalls the seminal works by Tchaikovsky, Dvořák, and Elgar) that stands among Cissell's most impressive musical achievements to date. Pulp, the second piece on the album, draws inspiration from the aesthetics of film noir, French New Wave, and other midcentury film movements. A suite for strings in four movements (with cinematically suggestive titles such as 'The Night Can Wait' and 'Soft Menace'), Pulp takes the listener on a thrill ride through a sonic realm that is at once familiar and uncanny. Both works on the album were recorded and produced in their entirety by the composer, continuing a steady practice developed over a decade with works such as his String Quintet, the String Sextets Nos 1 & 2, Nightside, and Emerald Cities. With the spellbinding Serenade, Cissell shines with the dynamism of an artist at the top of his game, pushing ever further at the boundaries of contemporary classical music.\n\nA Giant Beside You\n\nBen Verdery, classical guitar, electric guitar; Ulysses Quartet\n\nReEntrant / New Focus REN04\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nFirst recordings of music by Bryce Dessner, Leonard Bernstein and Ben Verdery himself, plus music by Javier Farías. The recording features a work written for Verdery by Bryce Dessner, a longtime friend and collaborator. Also on the album - the seventeenth title in his discography - is Verdery's arrangement of Leonard Bernstein's Clarinet Sonata for classical guitar and string quartet, Chilean composer Javier Farías' 'Andean Suite' and two of Verdery's original compositions. Nearly all are first recordings. About his 'Quintet for High Strings' Bryce Dessner says, 'The work was composed for my dear friend, Ben Verdery, who has been a part of my life for nearly twenty-five years. This quintet brings me back to my primary instrument — the guitar — and my relationship with Ben, which was so formative in my development as a musician. In this new piece, I am exploring my relationship to the instrument in a new way.' The two original compositions on this album by Verdery are related: a theme in 'About to Fall' is heard in the opening motif of 'A Giant Beside You.' The former is an homage to the late composer Ingram Marshall, a close friend of Verdery's. The latter takes inspiration from Sly and the Family Stones' classic song 'Stand!'. Verdery also puts his compositional prowess to use in an arrangement of Bernstein's Clarinet Sonata. 'It was evident from the outset that the clarinet part simply played on the guitar would not be musically satisfying,' he said. His solutions included having one of the violinists play in unison with the guitar from time to time, and giving passages with sustained notes to the cello or viola. Also, said Verdery, 'to my utter delight, several of the piano passages played beautifully on the guitar.' The album closer, 'Andean Suite' by Javier Farías, evokes Andean folklore, from the Peruvian Yawar Fiesta (a symbolic fight celebrating the power of the indigenous people over the Spanish), to an Andean music form called huayno, and the Bolivian dance Diablada.\n\nChristian Li - Discovering Mendelssohn\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nChristian Li walks in Mendelssohn's footsteps, bringing the music from his travels to life. Recorded with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, we follow Mendelssohn's journeys with pieces written in Leipzig, Düsseldorf, Munich, Venice & London. The new album also includes music from the composer's inspirations and contemporaries: Bach, Mozart & Schubert.\n\nMaria Brym: More Like You\n\nNXN Recordings NXN3001\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nNorwegian artist and singer/songwriter Maria Brym explores modern songwriting and pop music in a retrospective sound. Some of her songs appear epic and bold, while others are stories told in kind and gentle musical surroundings. Her love for 80's pop and inspiration from Kate Bush might seem evident at times, but Maria has a personal and wonderful way of writing her melodies. Together with her production team Bård Berg and Anders Egil Meyn Jensen she has created a modern album with lots of charm and nostalgic references.\n\nRodando - Gabriela Garrubo\n\nNXN Recordings NXN2017\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nNorwegian-Brazilian Gabriela Garrubo has already made a mark on the live-scene in Norway with her incredible voice and her lovely blend of modern Nordic jazz and influences from Brazilian 80s music and bossa nova. Her lyrics performed in both English and Portuguese is about finding yourself and finding strength in a chaotic and unfair, yet beautiful world. Through 2021 and 2022 Gabriela has been working with producer Vetle Junker on her debut album Rodando. Together they have created a unique listening experience balancing a modern and fresh sound with retro associations. Touring Norway journalists have found her performances stunning and Bergens Tidende gave her show 6/6 review rating: 'The way she moves silky smooth through the scales and alternates between soft tones and attacking lines is admirable.'\n\nLicinio Refice: Cecilia\n\nElena Schirru, Marta Mari, Mickael Spadaccini, Leon Kim, Giuseppina Piunti, Alessandro Spina, Christian Collia, Patrizio La Placa, Giovanni Andreoli (chorus master), Orchestra e Coro del Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Giuseppe Grazioli\n\nDynamic CDS7967 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nItalian composer Licinio Refice was ordained as a priest in 1905, and his achievements as a composer sometimes led to conflict with the Catholic authorities. Cecilia was his first opera inspired by sacred themes, but even as a gloriously melodious azione sacra it took many years before a theatre production was possible. This 'song of Cecilia' narrates her martyrdom after refusing to renounce her Christian faith - it was an immediate and sensational success with audiences at its premiere in 1934. With its flowing and indisputably beautiful blend of Gregorian antiquity with verismo drama, Cecilia has retained an enduring and widespread popularity.\n\nGustav Mahler: Symphony No 3 in D minor\n\nEssen Philharmonic Orchestra, Bettina Ranch, Aalto Children's Choir, Ladies of the Essen Philharmonic Choir, Children's Choir of the Deutsche Oper Berlin / Tomas Netopil\n\nOehms Classics OC1718 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nGustav Mahler described his Third Symphony as 'a work in which the whole world is indeed reflected', a claim supported by its large, six-movement structure and the use of huge orchestral and choral forces, plus a part for alto solo. The first performance of the symphony took place on 9 June 1902 in Krefeld under Mahler's direction. This is the third recording of a Mahler symphony by the Essen Philharmonic Orchestra under conductor Tomas Netopil. They are joined here by Bettina Ranch (alto), the Aalto Children's Choir, the ladies of the Essen Philharmonic Choir and the children's choir of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.\n\nChoral Music of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor\n\nLondon Choral Sinfonia, James Orford, Alison Ponsford-Hill, Michael Waldron\n\nOrchid Classics ORC100247 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nOn this essential new release, sacred and secular choral works by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor - many of them never recorded before - are performed by the London Choral Sinfonia directed by Michael Waldron, with James Orford at the organ. The music of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor has for too long been neglected despite being of exceptional quality. When Michael Waldron began to explore Coleridge-Taylor's choral music, he was struck by the sheer variety and depth of skill he found - and that this music is not more widely known. This release brings together a representative selection of both sacred and secular works by this great British composer, from the simple, understated tones of Whispers of Summer, to the quasi-cantata grandeur of Now late on the Sabbath Day.\n\nTreasures from the New World, Volume 3 - music by Paulo Porto Alegre, Radames Gnattali, Jennifer Higdon, João Luiz, Ronaldo Miranda, Marlos Nobre, Roberto Sierra - includes first recordings\n\nFabio Zanon, guitar; Marcelo Barboza, flute; Clelia Iruzun, piano\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0669\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nSOMM Recordings announces the eagerly anticipated Volume 3 of Treasures from the New World throwing revealing new light on music from the Americas. Pianist Clelia Iruzun returns, accompanied by feted guitarist and Royal Academy of Music Professor Fabio Zanon (who provides informative booklet notes) and celebrated flautist Marcelo Barboza, both making their label debuts. Works by six Brazilian composers for permutations of guitar, flute and piano are featured, three of which - by Marlos Nobre, Ronaldo Miranda and João Luiz - are First Recordings. Also included is American composer Jennifer Higdon, whose questing flute and piano duet, Legacy, is a rhetorical meditation on suffering and loss. Composed for Iruzun in 2011, Nobre's Desafio No.37 pits guitar and piano against each other echoing Brazil's jousting troubadour tradition; Miranda's single-movement Alumbramentos for flute and piano fuses the traditional and the new; Luiz's Três na Pipa an animated depiction of three duelling kites; Paulo Porto Alegre's Choro Suite for guitar and flute blending dance forms with improvisatory-like brilliance.Radames Gnattali's Sonatina No.2 is a charming guitar and piano dialogue, Roberto Sierra's Cronicas del Descubrimiento (Chronicles of Discovery) a major addition to the flute and guitar repertoire.\n\nStimme der Liebe ('The Voice of Love') - Songs by Franz Schubert - Ian Partridge 85th Birthday Tribute\n\nIan Partridge, Jennifer Partridge, Ernest Lush\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0670\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nSOMM Recordings is delighted to pay tribute to the British tenor Ian Partridge on his 85th birthday on 12 June 2023 with Stimme der Liebe (The Voice of Love), a collection of iconic songs by Schubert, on which he is joined by his pianist-sister Jennifer Partridge and pianist Ernest Lush. The great German lyric baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau hailed Partridge's Schubert interpretations as 'a pure joy', an accolade that these 20 performances of Lieder, taken from BBC Radio broadcasts between 1968 and 1972 - and available now for the first time on disc - readily illustrate. They reveal Partridge's unique, insightful affinity with the complexity and nuance of Schubert's response to matters of the heart, a quality Fischer-Dieskau described - in a facsimile letter to the singer included in the booklet - as his 'respect and love for the music'. Among familiar works such as 'Im Fruhling', 'Das Fischermädchen' and 'An den Mond', are relative rarities such as 'Vor meiner Wiege', which Partridge describes in his booklet interview with Jon Tolansky exploring his 'life-long love affair' with Schubert's Lieder, as one of the composer's 'most inspired creations'. With a repertoire ranging from Monteverdi and Elizabethan lute songs to Schoenberg and Britten, Ian Partridge is one of the most acclaimed lyric tenors of his generation. He is especially known for his success with songs and Lieder and regarded as one of the great modern Schubert interpreters. His hugely successful partnership with his pianist-sister, Jennifer, saw the duo giving more than 430 recitals and making numerous recordings over their fifty-two-year-long partnership.\n\nJean-Baptiste Krumpholtz: Sonates en forme de scènes\n\nAnna Pasetti, harp\n\nDynamic CDS7988\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nA native of Prague, Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz acquired a passion for the harp at a young age and, after the encouragement of Haydn, became one of the most renowned harpists in Paris. His innovations in harp design enhanced its sound, and his compositions were highly appreciated by his contemporaries and for a long time after his tragic death. Recorded here together for the first time, the six Sonates en forme de scènes adopted the German sensitive style and used free form as a medium for maximum expressive depth, being admired by one commentator for their 'profound sense of harmony and unexpected modulations'.\n\nDoktor Lichtenthals MOZART\n\nAurelia Vişovan, Gunter Schagerl, Pandolfis Consort\n\nGramola 99268\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nPeter Lichtenthal, born Wolfgang Mayer in 1779 in Bratislava, was not only a physician, but also a composer and author, including of two Mozart biographies, to which high authenticity can be attributed due to his acquaintance with Constanze Mozart and his two sons Carl and Franz. As a great admirer of the genius Mozart, he created numerous transcriptions of Mozart's works. On its first CD of a two-part series by the title 'Doktor Lichtenthals MOZART', which is now released, the Pandolfis Consort presents piano works by W. A. Mozart in arrangements by Lichtenthal. On period instruments, the Consort takes over the function of the entire orchestra as a string quartet in the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 20 in D minor, K. 466, featuring the Romanian pianist Aurelia Vişovan on the likewise historic fortepiano. The Fantasy for Piano No. 4 in C minor, K. 475, and the Piano Sonata No. 14 in C minor, K. 457, also included on the CD, were extended by Peter Lichtenthal with a cello part, which is interpreted by Gunter Schagerl.\n\nLuftveränderung - Johann Strauss Sohn, Alexander Steinbrecher, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Kerstin Gruber, Ursula Reicher, Fritz Kreisler, Kurt Schwertsik, Heinz Gietz, Robert Bachner, David Mann\n\nquinTTTonic\n\nGramola 99288\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nThe brass quintet quinTTTonic came together in Vienna in 2017 and prepares its audience a cocktail of fine brass sounds, enriched by vocals and a touch of poetry. The five brass players' debut album 'Luftveränderung' (Change of Air) is presenting a colorful sel-ection of pieces ranging from Viennese classical music, contemporary works and jazzy chaos to traditional local music and original compositions. The tailor-made repertoire is mainly characterized by the collaboration with composers - such as Leonhard Paul, Ursula Reicher and Kurt Schwertsik. Five female brass players from Upper Austria, Lower Austria and Carinthia - five individual cha-racters, five creative minds, four different instruments. Their different roots are clearly noticeable, as is their love of musical experi-mentation - Crossover at its best!\n\nRichard Strauss Lieder\n\nThomas Laske, Verena Louis\n\nKlanglogo KL1546\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nStrauss left over 200 songs to the world. The renowned singer Thomas Laske dedicates himself to a selection of these songs: Opus 29, 46 and 47 from the early works of Richard Strauss as well as a selection from Opus 10 and Opus 27 can be heard. The music of Strauss has accompanied Laske since his student days and has always played a major role in his repertoire: the listener can experience how effortlessly the singer masters the often high demands that Strauss imposes on the performer's ambition. Verena Louis' playing is equally convincing with its range of virtuosity and intimacy. Voice and instrument complement each other wonderfully, always being on equal footing and merging into a tonal unity.\n\nEchoes - Martin Lohse\n\nBjarke Mogensen, Mikkel Egelund Nielsen\n\nOrchid Classics ORC100242\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nIn an album of world-premiere recordings, accordionist Bjarke Mogensen performs Martin Lohse's extraordinary Echoes off Cliffs - 'a symphony in rural surroundings'. Mogensen had long imagined performing among the dramatic cliffs of Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea. Inspired by this concept, Lohse wrote Echoes off Cliffs for accordion, electroacoustics and six speakers, conjuring up the atmospheric reverberations of this unique landscape. Mogensen is also joined by guitarist Mikkel Egelund Nielsen for Lohse's beautiful Sort sol / Black Sun: Starling murmurations - fast moving patterns in the sky, a work commissioned by and dedicated to these artists and based on the phenomenon of starling murmurations creating sweeping masses that move in ever-changing patterns across the sky, blocking the light of the sun.\n\nFriedrich Theodor Frohlich (1803-1836): Lieder & Elegies\n\nKlaus Mertens, bass-baritone; Volodymyr Lavrynenko, piano\n\nRondeau Productions ROP6244\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nFriedrich Theodor Frohlich, born in Brugg in 1803, is probably the most important Early Romantic composer in Switzerland. However, he shares with many of his colleagues the fate of being forgotten after his death in 1836. Today, more than 700 works are kept in the manuscript archive of the Basel University Library. Thanks to the International Friedrich Theodor Frohlich Society based in Brugg, this legacy has been rediscovered since 2017, edited piece by piece and performed in concerts. Bass-baritone Klaus Mertens follows in Frohlich's footsteps and, together with lied pianist Volodymyr Lavrynenko, takes an exciting look at Frohlich's extensive lied oeuvre: Eight Canzonettas on poems by Goethe and Uhland, among others, as well as the Declamatory Songs, in which the performers feel the composer's emotional vibrations, are framed by three elegies for solo piano with a haunting tonal language and sometimes astonishing twists.\n\nDreams and Dances: Chamber Music for Clarinet by the Krein Family - Alexander, Grigory and Yulian\n\nAnne Elisabeth Piirainen, Iryna Gorkun-Silen, Lea Tuuri, Maria Puusaari, Jussi Aalto, Pinja Nunez, Kirill Kozlovski\n\nToccata Next TOCN0019\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nThe Krein family, with its origins in Lithuania, became a musical dynasty of considerable importance in Imperial and then Soviet Russia. The seven sons of its patriarch, Abram Krein, were all musicians, with Alexander and Grigory becoming respected composers, and Grigori's son, Yulian, adding another generation of Krein compositions. The dances and cantillation of their Jewish background was an important part of their musical make-up, combining at various stages with Russian folk-music, Skryabinesque harmony and French Impressionism. All three shared a predilection for the clarinet, developing a repertoire for the instrument that is only now beginning to be discovered - in what one might call a Krein scene investigation.\n\nBachs, Benda and Bronnimann: Music for Flute\n\nMarkus Bronnimann, flute; Jean Halsdorf, cello; Leon Berben, harpsichord; Ensemble Pyramide\n\nToccata Next TOCN0022\n\nRelease: 16 June 2023\n\nFour of the composers on this recording met in real life - in Potsdam, in spring 1747. In this album they are reunited, joined by the flautist-composer who brings their encounter to life once more, the Swiss-born Markus Bronnimann. The stylistic contrasts between works three centuries apart serve to accentuate their strengths, the formal elegance of the earlier pieces underlining the expressive liberty of the recent ones. Bronnimann combines the two worlds with his luminous arrangement of one of the best-known of all classical compositions: Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor.\n\n9 JUNE 2023\n\nLullabies for Piano and Cello\n\nGabríel Ólafs\n\nDecca Records US\n\nRelease: 9 June 2023\n\nIcelandic composer Gabríel Ólafs' holistic vision sets him apart as a true auteur of postmodern classical music. At only 24, he is arguably Gen Z's most important composer. Now Gabríel returns with a new album inspired by the folk songs of Iceland. A tribute to motherhood. A fantasy for his generation.\n\nVoice Of Rachmaninoff\n\nJohn-Henry Crawford, cello; Victor Santiago Asunción, piano\n\nOrchid Classics ORC100241\n\nRelease: 9 June 2023\n\nVoice Of Rachmaninoff, the third album of highly-decorated American cellist John-Henry Crawford. Crawford again joins forces with pianist Victor Santiago Asunción to mark the 150th anniversary of Sergei Rachmaninoff as a remarkable composer and pianist. The new album displays the power and richness of Rachmaninoff's piano writing and extremely vocal style, highlighting his impeccable ability to sing through the soaring melodies that one finds across his entire musical output. The album's first single, the second movement of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op 18 'Preghiera,' arranged by Fritz Kreisler and Shelbie Rassler, is out today accompanied by one of Crawford's popular music videos. Additional singles are scheduled for May 12 (Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op 43, Var XVII - Andante Cantabile) and May 26 ('How fair this spot' from 12 Romances). Hailed by the Philadelphia Inquirer for his 'polished charisma' and 'singing sound,' Crawford's new album features ten collections of work that include transcriptions from Rachmaninoff's solo piano literature. Each piece is a testament to the genius of Rachmaninoff and the singing, emotive power of the cello, which represents Rachmaninoff's voice in this album. The cellist shares in his notes, 'From the slow movement of his second piano concerto in the seemingly infinite lines of the winds and strings, the yearning Elégie adapted from his Morceaux de Fantasie, to the eighteenth variation of his Rhapsody for piano and orchestra which climbs to an ever-reaching climax.' As one of the most revered pianists and celebrated for his magnificent compositions for the instrument, Rachmaninoff is well known for his lyrical melodies and late Romantic style. Crawford says, 'His romances for voice like 'How fair this spot' and 'Oh never sing to me again' show his heart on his sleeve while his Vocalise magnifies the human voice to an almost total purity, devoid of any given syllables or words.' Following his last highly-acclaimed album, CORAZÓN (Orchid Classics 2022), Crawford's Voice of Rachmaninoff is a collection of work that shows Rachmaninoff at his most nostalgic and illustrates how adept he was at fusing pianistic brilliance with rich soulful lyricism. He further adds, 'The mainstay of the program is the Sonata in G Minor for Cello and Piano, which is the only sonata Rachmaninoff wrote for any solo instrument other than piano. Rachmaninoff had a great affection for the cello, not surprisingly given its likeness to the human voice. The Sonata boasts one song after another in a vast work with a devilishly difficult piano part, on par with that of his piano concerti.'\n\nRachmaninov: Piano Concer"
