        "text": "I recommend you go with whichever one speaks to you the most. I'm a big Journe fan but then again I don't like all their models and prefer many Pateks over some Journes given the same price point. The opposite is true in other cases.\n\nThe fit and finish is great on both and the movements are top notch as you would expect. Journe's style is fairly unique and you either love it or hate it. Patek is generally more conservative.\n\nDo you have any specifics models you're considering?\n\nThe Journe Resonance is the most unique and collectible but are priced at around 120-130k CHF retail. The Chronomètre Optimum has the most accurate movement and a dead beat second at the back but less collectible and maybe undervalued compared to other Journes.\n\nWith 100K why not get a Chronomètre Souverain and a Patek 5170/5172, 5905, 5231 or 5968?\n\nVoutilainen has incredible finishing and I plan to visit the manufacture as soon as the Covid rules are relaxed to order one. No idea about collectibility though. I think most customers are true enthusiasts who already own Patek, VC then Journe. Voutilainen is the next step.\n\nMy quick take: If you can get a Journe at a boutique (Miami or LA) that would be great, go for it over the Patek if you love it. Watchbox seems to be the market maker for Journe as they are buying everything and reselling it at high margin. If you can't get a new Journe from boutique, I'd call Cellini in NYC and get a Voutilainen that is in production, perhaps you can change the dial, color or between Arabic and Roman numerals if there is a watch that is not already spoken for?\n\nGetting a Voutilainen is like having a neighbor in France named Picasso in the year 1910 and getting a painting of his because he needs money for rent and women. Everything is exceptional. Talking about movement, Patek is using silicon in their movements now and some speculate it's why they no longer have the Geneva seal, instead they stamp movement with their own (PP) seal.\n\nDefinitely will visit the FP Journe boutique in LA as I am local. I thought the reason for the Patek not getting the Geneva seal is because they have moved the factory out of Canton, which is one of the criteria.\n\nIs Silicon worse in the movement manufacturer in terms of durability?\n\nI just saw the chocolate Voutilainen on youtube! OMG\n\nLook at Dufuor watches on YT as well. If considering, would need to add another zero to the budget.\n\nFor a more budget friendly independent look at Laurent Ferrier, not in the same \"league\" and a bit limited stylistically but quality/finsh is there, a lot watch for the $$.\n\nImage Unavailable, Please Login\n\nI think Patek switched to silicon in the balance spring because of reliability and accuracy from magnetic and temperature changes...but for some, and for $100k budgets, it's cutting corners for a mechanical watchmaker. Patek isn't on the same level as FPJ, KV, Grönefeld, Bovet, Claret, and many others. But Patek does have top notch name recognition and arguably better liquidity if you need to sell quickly if that's a consideration.\n\nSpeaking of Philippe Dufour as @poljav mentioned above, Dufour has raised more than an eyebrow at the thought of using a silicon balance springs in mechanical watches. If perfect accuracy in all temperatures and all shock configurations is desired, why not just buy an Apple watch? Or any $50 quartz watch which will outperform any Patek in any accuracy test any day of the week.\n\nFerrier is another great example, higher horology than Patek, not as well known, they make about twelve watches a month and amazing value. If this Ferrier had a Patek logo, it would be $150,000+\n\nI see a lot of brand names being thrown around here. Make sure to see them in person, just because they only make 2 watches a year doesn't mean they're all that. I've had 2 Grönefelds for sale in my office and I was not impressed with either. Journe captivated me from the beginning and that only increased when I saw it in person. The main reason why a lot of other independents are getting attention now is because of Journe.\n\nLaurent Ferrier is a good option as well but you'd have to spend less as I don't think their 100k offerings match Journe or PP for that kind of budget.\n\nNot sure what your collection consists of but for 100k I'd go Patek, Journe or Lange.\n\nI'll dig up some pictures later today. I know they only make around 150 watches a year but the movements are sourced from Switzerland then assembled and maybe refinished in the Netherlands. That's all fine, I don't expect everyone to make their own movement. However, the movement finish did absolutely nothing for me. It just didn't seem like a 70k watch honestly. I'm also not a big fan of the design but that is subjective.\n\nI really like the Principia (in house movement I think???) but sounds like it was a different model from your description."
