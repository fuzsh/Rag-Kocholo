        "text": "Written by Jerusha Dyson (client of Elam Stoltzfus for over 4 years)\n\nThere are many equine related professions that keep our horses happy, healthy, and sound. Veterinarians provide routine & emergency medical services, dentists float teeth so that horses can eat well and train properly, trainers teach people and horses how to get along and accomplish goals together, farm hands provide the day to day needs of horses, and then there is the farrier.\n\nFarriers have existed ever since people started taming horses. Prior to the 19th century farriers were usually blacksmiths that trimmed and shod horses only as part of their occupation. They also worked with steel in a variety of ways to repair machinery and tools of any kind. During the 19th century machines and cars replaced horses, and they also replaced blacksmiths as machines could work metal much faster than any man. This led to a decrease in the number of blacksmiths and farriers and made the trade more competitive, requiring a honing of skills and increase in education.\n\nFast forward to the 21st century and the job of a farrier has changed in many ways. Farriers are now expected to correct abnormalities in a horse’s conformation, identify, diagnose, and fix lameness, read, and interpret radiographs, reassure, and satisfy clients who spend thousands of dollars each year on their sport horses, and then get under a horse and pound steel in front of a hot forge. They must be professional and a people person, but also endure the back breaking, long sweaty hours perfecting hoof and shoe shape. Farriers today might use power tools, pre-made shoes, and many different substances besides steel, but they still use a forge, anvil, and hammer. At its core, the job is still the same: balance the hoof through trimming and nail on a shoe depending on the horse’s needs and occupation.\n\nAbout Elam\n\nThere is a man who embodies all of these traits and abilities and his name is Elam Stoltzfus. Elam has been working as a farrier (and blacksmith) for over 20 years. He started training as a farrier in 1998 and apprenticed under an experienced farrier for 3 years followed by another 3 years of part time apprenticeship as he took on clients of his own as Centerville Farrier based in Lancaster, PA. He has worked on horses in every discipline: giant draft work horses standing over 18 hands, standardbreds (race and road horses), sport horses, pleasure riding horses, broodmares and wild foals, ponies, minis, donkeys, and more.\n\nAlways seeking to improve his skill set, Elam is eager to learn and continue his education through attaining higher levels of certification, attending farrier and blacksmith conferences, brainstorming with other farriers, and reading.\n\nIn 2014 he joined the BWFA and achieved Journeyman I Certification and upgraded to Journeyman II in 2020. He passed an intensive written exam to receive his APF-I certification through AAPF. His enthusiasm for education benefits his business and those who have apprenticed under him.\n\nHe is also excited to work with veterinarians and other equine professionals to expand his knowledge and to assist in creating the best treatment and shoeing plan for his clients’ horses. Elam’s vast knowledge of the anatomy of a horse’s legs and hooves help him to shoe a horse near perfection and explain in detail to his clients how his work is benefitting their horse as a whole.\n\nNow a few words about Elam’s skill as a farrier. Not only is he all of the above, but he is also an exceptional farrier. He takes pride in his work to deliver a balanced foot, shod or unshod, with a well-trimmed frog and cleanly rasped hoof wall. He is able to trim and shoe the “normal” foot with ease and has worked extensively on horses with major problems including leg and hoof injuries, laminitis, and birth defects. He can watch a horse walk to see how they move and place their foot and know where the weaknesses are and how to trim and shoe to support those weaknesses.\n\nHis advanced ability to work and shape steel allows him to create just the right shoe and shoe shape that a horse need. Often, he has been called on by veterinarians to assist in particularly bad cases of laminitis, neglect, or poor work. He is respected by equine professionals and trusted by his clients. Many horses owe their comfort and soundness to his skillful trimming and shoeing ability.\n\nOne of Elam’s best traits is his character as any of his clients would attest. They can be found sitting in his shop while he trims their horse and tells stories that produce laugh tears or watching with concern at his desire not to let go of the hoof of a barely handled 2-year-old colt that is rearing and striking. He is kind to the horses he works on and is willing to work with any temperament of horse. His good character and work ethic are evident in the constancy of his clients. They travel across state lines or happily pay to have him cross state lines in order to keep him as their farrier. Many of his clients are now his friends. They can trust him as he is always honest about their horses’ needs and does not create work for himself to line his wallet.\n\nElam Stoltzfus is truly one of a kind. Any horse would benefit from his work and he is willing and excited to help any horse that he can. In his spare time, he is found hammering away on steel to create tools and/or artistic designs. He seamlessly combines the centuries-old trade of blacksmithing with 21st century knowledge. He is an old-fashioned blacksmith using his advanced skills in shaping metal to perfect the art of shoeing. Wherever he works Elam brings with him knowledge, experience, professionalism, kindness, and a desire to do the best possible trim or shoeing job. He looks at the horse as a whole and not only the feet.\n\nHe is the last person to seek after fame, but the first one to deserve it and so I recommend him to the Hall of Fame, where he belongs.\n\nGeorge and Suzanne Goode\n\nTucson School of Horseshoeing, Tucson, Arizona\n\nInducted 2020\n\nsubmitted by Jon Roach, nominated by Bucky Hatfield\n\nIn 2003 I attended Tennessee State Blacksmith and Farrier School owned and operated by Bucky Hatfield. I took his Masters course approved by the Veterans Administration under the Disabled Veterans Re-education Program. This was the four month class. Bucky expected nothing but perfection from me because I was a veteran. He pushed me and would not pass any test or forge work that was not 100%. Because of this I graduated top of my class with a near perfect score. I was only in the school for two days and Bucky had me out shoeing horses after hours because he said I was more than capable to shoe but I most definitely must pass his course to be certified. I did this all throughout my time in his school.\n\nAfter I graduated from Bucky's school I was turned out into the real world of Farrier work. Going back into my own area I soon realized that farrier work did not matter to owners. All they cared about was slapping shoes on their horses and didn't care how it was done or how good. To me this was a sad state of affairs and I vowed to change that in a hurry. Many times I butted heads with the old timers and old thinking that we only shoe horses when they wanted to ride them, trim horses maybe once a year or two and for pasture and breeding stock there wasn't even a thought about their care. You only call someone when they can't walk. It was a nightmare of outlaws and wild horses with more problems than you could shake a stick at with foot problems.\n\nAt that point I said it was time to educate and change people's minds and ways of doing things. Lots a chatting, talking and showing them everything I could find finally changed their minds and thinking. Now these old timers are some of my most loyal clients. Word of mouth spread quickly and the use of social media and computers. The old saying, “pictures are worth a thousand words” is still true today. Technology actually became my biggest tool I had. This move was huge for change in our area; no other farrier or shoer had gone this far to help them. Our area is a very poor area and not very up to date on some of the thinking in equine care. I kept my rates low so all could afford and receive the care needed for their animals and bring them into modern times of Farrier Science. This way of attacking the problem around here was successful and still works. I have always gone about this work not by how much money I can make but what I can provide to clients so all can afford it. To me this is not about money but about the horse. I will never be rich or make tons of money but feel better about providing to all.\n\nI attended BWFA Conventions, clinics and referred to my mentor and now friend, Buck Hatfield for assistance. I joined the BWFA with an Apprentice II certification with goals of upgrading.\n\nThe first four years we took on every foundered horse we could lay our hands on. We would come home at the end of a day and there would be 2-4 horses standing or laying in my front yard. Some were standing, most were lying down because they could not walk. People just drove up to the house and drag a horse off the trailer and leave, most of the time we didn't even know who dropped them off. We had up to 22 horses in various stages of laminitis and founder all the way to sinkers. This was my learning tool. I shod all these horses differently to see what works and what doesn't. We took notes and pictures to map progress. Even the local Vet got involved with this so he would learn more about the effects of founder and never charged us for work he did. It was a win, win situation for all involved. Out of the 22 horses we had we only lost two because they were too far gone to help. The rest of these horses returned back to normal usage from riding to pasture mates for other horses. My name became the vet’s first choice in foundered horses in our area. The Vets would tell their clients if you want to save your horse you better call a professional farrier, Jon.\n\nNext step of understanding was White Line Disease. We attacked it the same way as the foundered horses. Nobody in our area knew about this or what it was. Many others didn't even catch the signs of White Line. We learned how to control and stop the damage.\n\nI have spent many hours of educating clients on these problems and brought forth awareness. Again my biggest tool was pictures and the internet. I will use whatever I can to achieve the end goal.\n\n2007 I felt I had learned enough to test out for my Journeyman Certification so I tested and passed. My goals were still to further educate clients and expand their knowledge and mine also. I started to offer and host clinics and round tables whenever I could to get everybody involved. We conducted them at local horse campgrounds and clients barns. I still attend every clinic I can find to continue my education in all aspects of equine care and health. This information I then pass back to my clients to help them. I have achieved and bettered our area by doing this. My cell phone never stops ringing from people with all kinds of question from health, care, maintenance and feeding programs.\n\nI have made huge improvements in care of our horses in this area compared to 13 years ago. We see less horses being euthanized because of lameness issues and hoof problems. My attack on these problems has been successful and shows results within the community. All of my clients are on board with saving as many horses through knowledge and skill.\n\nI am dedicated towards the horse with my heart, mind, body and soul. I promote the art of Farrier Science every chance I get. Not only do we care for equine in this area I have been called out for cattle, goats, sheep and even was called out to a farm to trim a pet buffalo. I have even made a hit in the Barefoot community because they are not happy with the way their people conduct their business and care for their horses. I am not done yet. There is so much more to learn and share back into the community.\n\nI am going to use this nomination to draw in the next generation of Farriers and horse owners and spread the art of Farrier Science for the health and care of the horses in my work area. I want to show people what can be achieved with all the proper care and knowledge.\n\nPrior to my shoeing career:\n\nBorn: December 29, 1963 in Grand Island, Nebraska\n\n1981 enlisted in the US Army in May for the RANGER Battalion on the Delayed Entry Program\n\n1982 completed Basic Training, AIT, Airborne School and Sniper Training at Fort Benning GA. Later I returned to Fort Benning to complete Senior Parachutist School. Served all over the world where my skills were needed. I served a total of 13 years in the military.\n\n1994 Last duty station was at Fort Dix NJ as a Drill Sergeant. I also served as a Drill Instructor in the Young Marine Corp Youth Cadet Program.\n\nIn the civilian world after the military I worked as a truck driver, security guard and as an ironworker/welder until 1999\n\n1999 moved to Tennessee and continued to work as an ironworker and welder\n\nRick Wheat\n\nInducted 2015\n\nArkansas\n\nJohn Marino was born October 16, 1934 in Staten Island, NY. When he was 12 he began working after school as a stable boy. One day he was angry about something when, out of this 12 old, came a stream of expletives as he made his way through the barn. Reverend James Sargent, a local preacher and part-time blacksmith overheard him. The Reverend grabbed John and scolded him for his ways. Perhaps this was Divine Intervention, because, as punishment, John was instructed to work the bellows of the preachers’ forges—thus a lifetime love of blacksmithing was born.\n\nIn 1952 John joined the Air Force. He did not return to the area until 1956. When he completed his tour of duty, he began serving an apprenticeship as a blacksmith/farrier’s assistant with a Mr. Svendensen in North Branch, NJ where he learned “old world” shoeing - making shoes from iron bars and shaping them hot in the fire. Eighteen months later Mr. Svendensen died and John was on his own. He built up a nice business, but he still had the desire to increase his knowledge of the craft. Eight years later, he enrolled at the University of Arizona Farrier’s School in 1966 where he studied under Donald Canfield, considered one of the best in the field of corrective shoeing.\n\nIn his time off, he loved to rodeo....bareback, saddle bronc and bull ride...in later years he did “slow” down and did only roping.....competing frequently at the Cowtown Rodeo in Woodstown, NJ. Shoeing was his life and he did most of it in Monmouth County, NJ until he moved to Texas in 1980 to “warm up”. Two years after arriving in Texas, he opened “Across the Anvil Farrier Supply” store in Peaster, Texas which he operated until he sold it in 1991. In 1984 he started JHM Manufacturing and revolutionized the anvil industry by introducing a line of farrier anvils with wider faces and turning cams.\n\nAbout this same time, he was holding a “Wednesday night” forging class each week in his shop. There would be, usually, 6-10 farriers in attendance. They all wanted to improve their skills in order to participate in forging and shoeing competitions. Many of them went on to much greater things as a result of John’s instruction.\n\nIn 1985 John sponsored Grant Moon in his move to America from England. That year, John and Grant won the Two Man Forging Class 1 AND the Class 2 US Forging Championship competition in Malibu, California. During the next few years, John and Grant worked closely together, learning from each other, shoeing and competing in contests. In 1988 they joined forces to open the “Texas School of Farrier Science”, a horseshoeing school where they both taught. They closed the school in 1992 and went back to shoeing exclusively. John continued to shoe and compete in contests until 1995 when he retired from shoeing.\n\nJohn holds the Certified Master Farrier designation in the BWFA of which he is a charter member. He also holds the Certified Journeyman Farrier designation in the AFA and the TPFA. He served as Vice-President of the TPFA for 6 years. He is an active lifetime member of all three organizations.\n\nHe continued to operate JHM Manufacturing, making 6 styles of anvils and anvil stands until April of 2005, when he sold the business to Anvil Brand Shoe Company and retired…again.\n\nJohn has dedicated his life to improving and furthering the farrier industry through education and professionalism. His influence has been far reaching and has enhanced many a career.\n\nJud Nelson was born in 1911 in Cherokee County, Georgia and moved to Gordon County, Georgia at the age of 2. He resides there today in the community of Sugar Valley.\n\nJud was 7 years old the first time he saw a blacksmith shop and it scared him to death with all those sparks flying. He says, “I ran like a turkey!” When he was 9 his dad set up a blacksmith shop on the family farm to do farm repair work. It was Jud’s job to crank the blower for him. As a result of this, Jud started with blacksmithing himself when he was 12 or 13, making wagons for he and his friends to play with. When he was 17 he started shoeing horses for the neighbors to make some spending money.\n\nWhen Jud was 21 he worked for a man tempering steel and shoeing. With the money he made, he paid half the price for a blacksmith shop, with his uncle putting up the other half of the money. In 1934 Jud and his wife Jenny were married and he built his own shop. In 1941 Jud went to Jacksonville, Florida, to do blacksmithing for the Navy and stayed there until 1945.\n\nBlacksmithing was an important part of rural communities and Jud found much success at it. He worked as a blacksmith and shoer for many years and was featured in the book Foxfire 9 in 1986 in which he demonstrated the building of a farm wagon. That wagon is now on permanent display at the Foxfire Complex in Rabun County, Georgia.\n\nJud is well known and loved in his community of Sugar Valley where he shares his vast knowledge of the traditions of the past and his great skill as a master craftsman. He is a rare man, possessing extraordinary knowledge of something that was once vital to a thriving rural community.\n\nWe lost Jud on June 6, 2011 only 17 days before his 100th birthday. Jud was a great story teller, making everyone laugh and smile. He would tell us how in his shoeing years, the shoes were $0.05 a piece. He was a local visitor to every convention here and will be missed.\n\nRead more about Judd from the Prater's Mill 40th Anniversary Article HERE.\n\nElmer Seybold\n\nInducted 1993\n\nTexas\n\npassed away in 2005\n\nElmer Seybold was more or less raised in a Blacksmiths shop or a harness shop. His father was a teaming contractor in the early day oil fields and had over 500 head of horses and mules. It was necessary to have three blacksmiths and they were also farriers. The first job he ever had, that he actually received money for, was turning the Buffalo Blower for the head blacksmith, Tennessee Tom. Tom gave him a nickel an hour to turn the crank and supply the air to his forge. In 1928, an electric motor replaced Elmer and put him out of a job, although he never did work over three hours a day for Tom, because he only needed 15 cents to get into the picture show and buy a mug of root beer.\n\nElmer shod his first horse in 1927. He was 13 years old and lived in Seminole, Oklahoma. He took his horse to the blacksmiths shop to get shod and his papa was there and he said “Son, you’re big enough and old enough to shoe your own horse, so just get at it”. Elmer has been shoeing horses ever since.\n\nElmer gravitated to ranching in later life and was always teaching one or two cowboys to shoe their horses properly. He had the chance to teach at A&M college, and there he met Dr. Romain who asked why Elmer did not have a school for farriers. Elmer talked to two of the blacksmiths that worked for his father in the oilfields, Curly Hallmark and Shorty Woods. They advised him against it, because they said the trucks had replaced the horse. Elmer was stubborn and went ahead with the idea and opened the north Texas Farriers School in Mineral Wells, Texas in 1955. He started with just one student, and had the oldest Farrier School in the Nation. In 38 years, he graduated over 4,000 students who are now successful Farriers.\n\nElmer Seybold dedicated most of his life to the Farrier trade and to passing on the knowledge that he possessed to his students. One of Elmer’s students wrote him a letter and said “When you give knowledge through teaching, you give one the greatest gifts of all. You sir, will live forever through the gifts you have given your students.”\n\nWhen asked why he wanted to be a farrier and why he began teaching others to be farriers, he replied “I was kind of forced to become a farrier. I was more or less raised in a blacksmiths shop and had excellent teachers. Tennessee Tom Garrett taught farrier work in the calvary, and came to work for my father in the oilfields. Curly Hallmark had been in the calvary and followed Tom. Shorty Woods had been shoeing horses for over 20 years when he came to our teaming camp. Tom was a hard taskmaster. He would show you one time and if you did not get it and he had to show you a second time, you got a foot in the seat of the pants. I got my fair share of feet in the seat of the pants. Yes, I had excellent teachers. I also became a farrier because when papa died, there was no one to shoe the horses on the ranch. I did not need the money but I started teaching others to shoe horses simply because a lot of farriers did not know what they were doing, and I wanted to teach them how to do it properly for the welfare of the horses. This should always be the reason for shoeing horses. A farrier is the most important person that cares for a horse.\n\nIn 1947, Elmer invented the Lateral Extension shoe. At that time they used one caulk on the inside or outside to turn the foot, he figured there must be a better way than what they were using. The foot always turns to the high side or the long side so he reasoned that to help a horse with toe-in or toe-out he should put an extension on the toe and a low heel caulk, which was better than what they had been using.\n\nIn 1951, Elmer invented the Keyhold shoe. Over a period of years that he had been raising horses, he found that some old horses would be walking fine one day and the next day they would be walking on their Sesamoid bone, particularly on their hind feet. He put a number of these Keyhole shoes on these said horses and in about 15 or 20 days they were walking normally and they have never reverted to this condition again.\n\nIn 1952, Elmer invented the Rocker Plate Shoe for stiff ankles. The low ring bone or the high ring bone or combination of both can cause Ankylosis or stiff ankles. If you stop and think about it, you realize that the flexibility of the ankle allows the hoof to be raised and moved forward with the rocking motion that is smooth and uninterrupted. At one time, a horse with this problem was shod with 3/4” square stock thinned out at the toes and buttresses, this having a rocking motion when you picked up the foot and placed it forward. This was a heavy shoe and Elmer likes to use as light a shoe as possible to do the job. So he devised a lighter shoe that has the rocking motion of the ankles. He calls this a Rocker-Plate shoe. The advantage of this shoe is that it is about half the weight of the old bar shoe and it will not sink in the sand of the area or mud as easily as the old type of shoe. Of course, if a horse is in this condition, he is crippled and will always be crippled no matter what type of shoe you use on him, but if you wish to do something with this horse that requires some traction, you can run a bead of hard surfacing rod across the steel plate and you will have some traction.\n\nIn 1955, Elmer had a chance to meet with Dr. James R. Rooney DVM in Lexington, KY. This was a man that Elmer admired very much. He asked Dr. Rooney what would be his ideal shoe and the shape of the shoe. Without any hesitancy Dr. Rooney replied “ the shoe that would give the best traction in any direction would be a triangle shaped shoe. Elmer had been using a triangle shaped shoe for about 40 years and had made the shoe for the reason that Dr. Rooney described. Elmer says he does not know if he invented it or not but that he has never seen it used by anyone else.\n\nElmer traveled all over the world and everywhere that he went, he would visit with farriers and compare notes. The first meeting of the B.W.F.A. Master Educators was held at Elmers school in 1989. He was instrumental in gaining recognition for the B.W.F.A. throughout Texas by sponsoring clinics on continuing education for farriers.\n\nAmong his many distinguished awards, he was inducted into the BWFA Farriers Hall of Fame in 1992. He also received the Lifetime Achievers Award in 1994. Elmer passed away in 1995 and will be sorely missed."
