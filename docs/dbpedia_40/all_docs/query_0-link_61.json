Activation of the TCR enhances PLC-Î³1 enzymatic function, resulting in calcium influx and the activation of PKC family members and RasGRP. The current model is that phosphorylation of LAT tyrosine 132 facilitates the recruitment of PLC-Î³1, leading to its activation and function at the LAT complex. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation kinetics of LAT and PLC-Î³1 and the cellular localization of activated PLC-Î³1. We observed that commencement of the phosphorylation of LAT tyrosine 132 and PLC-Î³1 tyrosine 783 occurred simultaneously, supporting the current model. However, once begun, PLC-Î³1 activation occurred more rapidly than LAT tyrosine 132. The association of LAT and PLC-Î³1 was more transient than the interaction of LAT and Grb2 and a pool of activated PLC-Î³1 translocated away from LAT to cellular structures containing the TCR. These studies demonstrate that LAT and PLC-Î³1 form transient interactions that catalyze the activation of PLC-Î³1, but that activated PLC-Î³1 resides in both LAT and TCR clusters. Together, this work highlights that our current model is incomplete and the activation and function of PLC-Î³1 in T cells is highly complex.

K.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPower line communication (PLC) technology can be a viable solution for the future ubiquitous networks because it provides a cheaper alternative to other wired technology currently being used for communication. In smart grid Power Line Communication (PLC) is used to support communication with low rate on low voltage (LV) distribution network. In this paper, we propose the channel modelling of narrowband (NB) PLC in the frequency range 5 KHz to 500 KHz by using ABCD parameter with cyclostationary noise addition. Behaviour of the channel was studied by the addition of 11KV/230V transformer, by varying load location and load. Bit error rate (BER) Vs signal to noise ratio SNR) was plotted for the proposed model by employing OFDM. Our simulation results based on the proposed channel model show an acceptable performance in terms of bit error rate versus signal to noise ratio, which enables communication required for smart grid applications.\n\nModeling of Hydration, Compressive Strength, and Carbonation of Portland-Limestone Cement (PLC) Concrete.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Xiao-Yong\n\n2017-01-26\n\nLimestone is widely used in the construction industry to produce Portland limestone cement (PLC) concrete. Systematic evaluations of hydration kinetics, compressive strength development, and carbonation resistance are crucial for the rational use of limestone. This study presents a hydration-based model for evaluating the influences of limestone on the strength and carbonation of concrete. First, the hydration model analyzes the dilution effect and the nucleation effect of limestone during the hydration of cement. The degree of cement hydration is calculated by considering concrete mixing proportions, binder properties, and curing conditions. Second, by using the gel-space ratio, the compressive strength of PLC concrete is evaluated. The interactions among water-to-binder ratio, limestone replacement ratio, and strength development are highlighted. Third, the carbonate material contents and porosity are calculated from the hydration model and are used as input parameters for the carbonation model. By considering concrete microstructures and environmental conditions, the carbon dioxide diffusivity and carbonation depth of PLC concrete are evaluated. The proposed model has been determined to be valid for concrete with various water-to-binder ratios, limestone contents, and curing periods.\n\nModeling of Hydration, Compressive Strength, and Carbonation of Portland-Limestone Cement (PLC) Concrete\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Xiao-Yong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nLimestone is widely used in the construction industry to produce Portland limestone cement (PLC) concrete.

PlcA and PlcB are two previously defined L. pneumophila proteins with homology to the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Additionally, we found that Lpg0012 shows similarity to PLCs and has been shown to be a Dot/Icm-injected effector, CegC1, which is designated here as PlcC. It remained unclear, however, whether these L. pneumophila proteins exhibit PLC activity. PlcC expressed in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed a broad phospholipid spectrum, including PC, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylinositol. The addition of Zn2+ ions activated, whereas EDTA inhibited, PlcC-derived PLC activity. Protein homology search revealed that the three Legionella enzymes and P. fluorescens PC-PLC share conserved domains also present in uncharacterized fungal proteins. Fifteen conserved amino acids were essential for enzyme activity as identified via PlcC mutagenesis. Analysis of defined L. pneumophila knock-out mutants indicated Lsp-dependent export of PG-hydrolyzing PLC activity. PlcA and PlcB exhibited PG-specific activity and contain a predicted Sec signal sequence. In line with the reported requirement of host cell contact for Dot/Icm-dependent effector translocation, PlcC showed cell-associated PC-specific PLC activity after bacterial growth in broth. A PLC triple mutant, but not single or double mutants, exhibited reduced host killing in a Galleria mellonella infection model, highlighting the importance of the three PLCs in pathogenesis. In summary, we describe here a novel Zn2+-dependent PLC family present in Legionella, Pseudomonas, and fungi with broad substrate preference and function in virulence.

PLC usage can be encountered in almost all fields of industry, not only in the manufacturing world but also on many other things such as elevators in office buildings, hotels hospitals, and others. PLC is an electronic control tool that operates in logic that its programming can be modified with relative ease. As with any controller in general, the PLC processes input signals to further discharge output according to the desired program. PLC usage is very broad because of its high reliability, can be reprogrammed or modified with relative ease, and very helpful in the tracking troubleshooting. One type of existing PLC is Allen Bradley PLC. Allen Bradley PLC program is commonly used in various industries. PLC Allen Bradley (AB) has several types, and one of them is the type of Micrologic 1400. In this study we design a system as a comparison with the conventional system. For that to explore the use of a PLC program which will be supported by a simulator tool, including a program to RSLogic 500, how to programming, monitoring via RSView32, and modification. It is expected to understand the application aspect of operation and programming of this specific PLC and its potential. The purpose of this research is to design water filling automation system by using Allen Bradley Micrologic 1400 type 1766-L32BXB PLC, empowering the use of Allen Bradley Micrologic 1400 PLC and to regulate the desired process to obtain efficiency and effectiveness compared with conventional system arrangement using Relay.\n\nBrothers in Excellence: An Empowerment Model for the Career Development of African American Boys\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGrimmett, Marc A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe author describes Brothers in Excellence (BE), a conceptual model for understanding African American boys and helping them to be successful.

Likewise, vendor-neutral middleware technologies such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) have recently demonstrated that they can greatly facilitate the integration of these industrial platforms into the overall control system. Many practical questions arise, however, when building multi-tiered control systems that consist of PLCs for low level control, and conventional software and platforms for higher level control. How should the PLC software be structured, so that it can rely on well-known programming paradigms on the one hand, and be mapped to a well-organized OPC UA interface on the other hand? Which programming languages of the IEC 61131-3 standard closely match the problem domains of the abstraction levels within this structure? How can the recent additions to the standard (such as the support for namespaces and object-oriented extensions) facilitate a model based development approach? To what degree can our applications already take advantage of the more advanced parts of the OPC UA standard, such as the high expressiveness of the semantic modeling language that it defines, or the support for events, aggregation of data, automatic discovery, ... ? What are the timing and concurrency problems to be expected for the higher level tiers of the control system due to the cyclic execution of control and communication tasks by the PLCs? We try to answer these questions by demonstrating a semantic state machine model that can readily be implemented using IEC 61131 and OPC UA. One that does not aim to capture all possible states of a system, but rather one that attempts to organize the course-grained structure and behaviour of a system. In this paper we focus on the intricacies of this seemingly simple task, and on the lessons that we\n\nBrother Moons\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2013-01-14\n\nSaturn small moons Atlas, Prometheus, and Epimetheus keep each other company in this image from NASA Cassini spacecraft of the planet night side.

The programming of these controllers is normally the domain of engineers with a background in electronics, this paper introduces PLC program development from the software engineer's perspective. PLC programs provide the link between control software running on PC architecture systems and physical hardware controlled and monitored by digital and analog signals. The higher-level software running on the PC is typically responsible for accepting operator input and from this deciding when and how hardware connected to the PLC is controlled. The PLC accepts demands from the PC, considers the current state of its connected hardware and if correct to do so (based upon interlocks or other constraints) adjusts its hardware output signals appropriately for the PC's demands. A published ICD (Interface Control Document) defines the PLC memory locations available to be written and read by the PC to control and monitor the hardware. Historically the method of programming PLCs has been ladder diagrams that closely resemble circuit diagrams, however, PLC manufacturers nowadays also provide, and promote, the use of higher-level programming languages4. Based on techniques used in the development of high-level PC software to control PLCs for multiple telescopes, this paper examines the development of PLC programs to operate the hardware of a medical cyclotron beamline controlled from a PC using the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), which is also widely used in telescope control5, 6, 7. The PLC used is the new generation Siemens S7-1200 programmed using Siemens Pascal based Structured Control Language (SCL), which is their implementation of Structured Text (ST). The approach described is that from a software engineer's perspective, utilising Siemens Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal integrated development environment (IDE) to create\n\nEfficient Implementation of a Symbol Timing Estimator for Broadband PLC.\n\nPubMed\n\nNombela, Francisco; GarcÃ­a, Enrique; Mateos, RaÃºl; HernÃ¡ndez, Ãlvaro\n\n2015-08-21\n\nBroadband Power Line Communications (PLC) have taken advantage of the research advances in multi-carrier modulations to mitigate frequency selective fading, and their adoption opens up a myriad of applications in the field of sensory and automation systems, multimedia connectivity or smart spaces. Nonetheless, the use of these multi-carrier modulations, such as Wavelet-OFDM, requires a highly accurate symbol timing estimation for reliably recovering of transmitted data. Furthermore, the PLC channel presents some particularities that prevent the direct use of previous synchronization algorithms proposed in wireless communication systems. Therefore more research effort should be involved in the design and implementation of novel and robust synchronization algorithms for PLC, thus enabling real-time synchronization. This paper proposes a symbol timing estimator for broadband PLC based on cross-correlation with multilevel complementary sequences or Zadoff-Chu sequences and its efficient implementation in a FPGA; the obtained results show a 90% of success rate in symbol timing estimation for a certain PLC channel model and a reduced resource consumption for its implementation in a Xilinx Kyntex FPGA.\n\nGlobal regulator Anr represses PlcH phospholipase activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa when oxygen is limiting.\n\nPubMed\n\nJackson, Angelyca A; Daniels, Emily F; Hammond, John H; Willger, Sven D; Hogan, Deborah A\n\n2014-10-01\n\nHaemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH) is a potent virulence and colonization factor that is expressed at high levels by Pseudomonas aeruginosa within the mammalian host. The phosphorylcholine liberated from phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin by PlcH is further catabolized into molecules that both support growth and further induce plcH expression. We have shown previously that the catabolism of PlcH-released choline leads to increased activity of Anr, a global transcriptional regulator that promotes biofilm formation and virulence. Here, we demonstrated the presence of a negative feedback loop in which Anr repressed plcH transcription and we proposed that this regulation allowed for PlcH levels to be maintained in a way that promotes productive host-pathogen interactions. Evidence for Anr-mediated regulation of PlcH came from data showing that growth at low oxygen (1%) repressed PlcH abundance and plcH transcription in the WT, and that plcH transcription was enhanced in an Îanr mutant. The plcH promoter featured an Anr consensus sequence that was conserved across all P. aeruginosa genomes and mutation of conserved nucleotides within the Anr consensus sequence increased plcH expression under hypoxic conditions. The Anr-regulated transcription factor Dnr was not required for this effect. The loss of Anr was not sufficient to completely derepress plcH transcription as GbdR, a positive regulator of plcH, was required for expression. Overexpression of Anr was sufficient to repress plcH transcription even at 21â% oxygen. Anr repressed plcH expression and phospholipase C activity in a cell culture model for P. aeruginosa-epithelial cell interactions.

The majority of pulmonary metastases appear nodular on radiologic images. Interstitial spread of tumor through pulmonary lymphatics, also known as pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis (PLC), is not uncommon and constitutes approximately 7% of pulmonary metastases. PLC is most often seen with adenocarcinoma of a variety of histologies such as thyroid carcinoma, and melanoma. It is usually noted in late stages of malignancy and therefore is indicative of a poor prognosis. Diagnosis of PLC is usually based on a combination of clinical and radiologic findings. However, the diagnosis is difficult when patients have limited clinical findings or have a history of or the possibility of other interstitial lung diseases. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been the modality of choice in the radiologic diagnosis of PLC. Imaging features of PLC on HRCT include thickening of interlobular septa, fissures, and bronchovascular bundles. Distribution of PLC may be focal or diffuse, unilateral or bilateral, and symmetric or asymmetric. Although FDG-PET has been extensively used in primary or secondary lung malignancies, its role and appearance in PLC have not been well determined in the literature. In this communication, we describe a spectrum of FDG-PET and CT findings in 5 cases with PLC. Similar to CT, the distribution of PLC can be extensive or limited on the FDG-PET. Diffuse, lobar, or segmental FDG uptake in the lungs is seen in extensive PLC. In limited PLC, a linear or a hazy area of FDG uptake extending from the tumor can be seen. Recognition of various patterns related to PLC on FDG-PET may allow accurate diagnosis of disease and could potentially influence the management of these patients.\n\n75 FR 50877 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc RB211-524C2 Series Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-08-18\n\n...

We investigated all-cause mortality and health-related behaviour among former elite athletes and their brothers. The mortality of Finnish male former elite athletes, who had represented Finland between 1920 and 1965 (n=900) and their age-matched brothers (n=900), was followed from the time when athlete started an elite athlete career until 31 December 2015. The age-adjusted HRs were calculated by a paired Cox proportional hazards model. In 2001, surviving participants (n=199 athletes and n=199âage-matched brothers) reported their self-rated health (SRH), physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking habits in the questionnaire. During the total follow-up period, 1296 deaths (72% of the cohort) occurred. The age-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality in former athletes was 0.75 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.87, P<0.001) compared with their age-matched brothers. Median age at death was 79.9 years for endurance, 75.9 years for mixed sports and 72.2 years for power sports athletes, and 77.5, 73.7 and 72.2 years for their age-matched brothers, respectively. In 2001, compared with their brothers, former athletes smoked less (P<0.001), were more physically active (P<0.05) and rated their health more often as very good (P<0.05). Former elite athletes are more physically active, smoke less, have better self-rated health and live longer than their brothers. Genetic differences between athletes and brothers, aerobic training for endurance elite sports and a healthier lifestyle may all contribute to reduced mortality.

DNA from blood samples of the alleged parents and their two children was obtained with Chelex DNA extraction method and quantified with Applied Biosystems QuantiBlot quantitation kit. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA samples was performed with AmpFlSTR SGM Plus PCR amplification kit and GenePrint PowerPlex PCR amplification kit. The amplified products were separated and detected by using the Perkin Elmer's ABI PRISM trade mark 310 Genetic Analyser. DNA and data analysis of 17 loci and Amelogenin confirmed the suspicion of brother-sister incest. Since both children had inherited all of the obligate alleles from the alleged father, we could confirm with certainty of 99.999999% that the oldest brother in the family was the biological father of both children. Calculated data showed that even in a case of brother-sister incest, paternity could be proved by the analysis of Amelogenin and 17 DNA loci.\n\n75 FR 58290 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc RB211 Trent 700 and Trent 800 Series Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-09-24\n\n...

In the present study, the relationship among handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation was studied in 4 samples of heterosexual and gay or bisexual men (N = 944). Unlike previous studies, which have only observed an increased rate of non-right-handedness in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men, an elevated rate of extreme right-handedness was found in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men. The results also demonstrated that older brothers moderate the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation. Specifically, older brothers increase the odds of being gay or bisexual in moderate right-handers only; in both non-right-handers and extreme right-handers, older brothers do not affect (or decrease) the odds of being gay or bisexual. The results have implications for an early neurodevelopmental origin to sexual orientation in men.

CXCR4 and TCR functions are consequently highly cross-regulated, affecting T cell immune activation, cytokine secretion, and T cell migration. The CXCR4-TCR heterodimer stimulates T cell migration and activation of the ERK MAP kinase and downstream AP-1-dependent cytokine transcription in response to SDF-1, the sole chemokine ligand of CXCR4. These responses require Gi-type G proteins as well as TCR ITAM domains and the ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, thus indicating that the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer signals to integrate GPCR-associated and TCR-associated signaling molecules in response to SDF-1. Yet, the phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes responsible for coupling the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer to distinct downstream cellular responses are incompletely characterized. Here, we demonstrate that PLC activity is required for SDF-1 to induce ERK activation, migration, and CXCR4 endocytosis in human T cells. SDF-1 signaling via the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer uses PLC-Î²3 to activate the Ras-ERK pathway and increase intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, while PLC-Î³1 is dispensable for these outcomes. In contrast, PLC-Î³1, but not PLC-Î²3, is required for SDF-1-mediated migration, via a mechanism independent of LAT. These results increase understanding of the signaling mechanisms employed by the CXCR4-TCR heterodimer, characterize new roles for PLC-Î²3 and PLC-Î³1 in T cells, and suggest that multiple PLCs may also be activated downstream of other chemokine receptors in order to distinctly regulate migration versus other signaling functions.

Many studies have shown that the four PLC-Î² subtypes have different physiological functions despite their similar structures. Because the PLC-Î² subtypes possess different PDZ-binding motifs, they have the potential to interact with different PDZ proteins. In this study, we identified PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) as a PDZ protein that specifically interacts with PLC-Î²3. To elucidate the functional roles of PDZK1, we next screened for potential interacting proteins of PDZK1 and identified the somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) as another protein that interacts with PDZK1. Through these interactions, PDZK1 assembles as a ternary complex with PLC-Î²3 and SSTRs. Interestingly, the expression of PDZK1 and PLC-Î²3, but not PLC-Î²1, markedly potentiated SST-induced PLC activation. However, disruption of the ternary complex inhibited SST-induced PLC activation, which suggests that PDZK1-mediated complex formation is required for the specific activation of PLC-Î²3 by SST. Consistent with this observation, the knockdown of PDZK1 or PLC-Î²3, but not that of PLC-Î²1, significantly inhibited SST-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which further attenuated subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the formation of a complex between SSTRs, PDZK1, and PLC-Î²3 is essential for the specific activation of PLC-Î²3 and the subsequent physiologic responses by SST.

Real time identification of these operational faults and behavioural anomalies is necessary in the manufacturing industry. In this paper, we present an automated tool, called PLC Log-Data Analysis Tool (PLAT) that can detect them by using log-data records of the PLC signals. PLAT automatically creates a nominal model of the PLC control process and employs a novel hash table based indexing and searching scheme to satisfy those purposes. Our experiments show that PLAT is significantly fast, provides real time identification of operational faults and behavioural anomalies, and can execute within a small memory footprint. In addition, PLAT can easily handle a large manufacturing system with a reasonable computing configuration and can be installed in parallel to the data logging system to identify operational faults and behavioural anomalies effectively.\n\nPLAT: An Automated Fault and Behavioural Anomaly Detection Tool for PLC Controlled Manufacturing Systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGhosh, Arup; Qin, Shiming; Lee, Jooyeoun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOperational faults and behavioural anomalies associated with PLC control processes take place often in a manufacturing system.

In this work, the basic idea is to measure the weight of the vehicles and classify them according to its weight to the respective lanes. It is difficult for the turnpike people to monitor the whole process all the time. So, this PLC based diversion system can be implemented in turnpikes to reduce the difficulties. This method will work based on weight sensors (piezo-resistive) whose output will be fed to a PLC, which will control the vehicle diversion. Using SCADA software, the whole process can be monitored from a remote area. The algorithm developed in this successfully installed in real time system.\n\nThe Mayo brothers: an American surgical legacy.\n\nPubMed\n\nToledo-Pereyra, Luis H\n\n2010-10-01\n\nFew in the history of surgery and just as few in the history of medicine can reach the level of clinical visibility as achieved by the Mayo brothers. The brothers changed the face of medicine while they were alive, and their fame and influence continued to grow after their death in 1939. The Mayo American surgical legacy had incredible proportions. The brothers systematically modified the field as few others had done before. They were great surgical innovators who took the surgical techniques of others and added a touch of their own to make the surgical procedure better and more secure. The Mayos were the stars regionally, nationally, and around the world. They attracted attention from their generation and occupied center stage long after. To speak of the Mayos is to speak of the quintessential American values of professionalism, respect, commitment, and caring for their fellow human beings. Their creation, the Mayo Clinic, surpassed the wildest hopes and predictions that anyone could have had regarding their best dreams.\n\nPower Line Communication (PLC) in Space - Current Status and Outlook\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolf, J.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe Power Line Communication (PLC) technology as known from various terrestrial applications, e.g. in building automation, in the automotive sector and on aircraft, appears to be a promising technology for the use on spacecraft. Starting from a critical overview on existing terrestrial PLC applications with their pros and cons, the paper gives a motivation for the introduction of the PLC technology on spacecraft, discusses the potential areas where it can be applied and is highlighting the potential problem areas.

A recent segregation analysis of Australian pedigrees has found a better fit of a two-locus model than single-locus models. This model included a dominantly inherited increased risk that was greater at younger ages and a recessively inherited or X-linked increased risk that was greater at older ages. Recent linkage analyses have led to the detection of at least 8 CaP predisposing genes, suggesting a complex inheritance and genetic heterogeneity. To assess the nature of familial aggregation of prostate cancer in France, segregation analysis was conducted in 691 families ascertained through 691 CaP patients, recruited from three French hospitals and unselected with respect to age at diagnosis, clinical stage or family history. This mode of family inclusion, without any particular selection of the probands, is unique, as probands from all previous analyses were selected according to various criteria. Segregation analysis was carried out using the logistic hazard regressive model, as incorporated in the REGRESS program, which can accommodate a major gene effect, residual familial dependences of any origin (genetic and/or environmental), and covariates, while including survival analysis concepts. Segregation analysis showed evidence for the segregation of an autosomal dominant gene (allele frequency of 0.03%) with an additional brother-brother dependence. The estimated cumulative risks of prostate cancer by age 85 years, among subjects with the at-risk genotype, were 86% in the fathers' generation and 99% in the probands' generation. This study supports the model of Mendelian transmission of a rare autosomal dominant gene with high penetrance, and demonstrates that additional genetic and/or common sibling environmental factors are involved to account for the\n\nPLC-based mode multi/demultiplexers for mode division multiplexing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaitoh, Kunimasa; Hanzawa, Nobutomo; Sakamoto, Taiji; Fujisawa, Takeshi; Yamashita, Yoko; Matsui, Takashi; Tsujikawa, Kyozo; Nakajima, Kazuhide\n\n2017-02-01\n\nRecently developed PLC-based mode multi/demultiplexers (MUX/DEMUXs) for mode division multiplexing (MDM) transmission are reviewed. We firstly show the operation principle and basic characteristics of PLC-based MUX/DEMUXs with an asymmetric directional coupler (ADC). We then demonstrate the 3-mode (2LP-mode) multiplexing of the LP01, LP11a, and LP11b modes by using fabricated PLC-based mode MUX/DEMUX on one chip. In order to excite LP11b mode in the same plane, a PLC-based LP11 mode rotator is introduced. Finally, we show the PLC-based 6-mode (4LP-mode) MUX/DEMUX with a uniform height by using ADCs, LP11 mode rotators, and tapered waveguides. It is shown that the LP21a mode can be excited from the LP11b mode by using ADC, and the two nearly degenerated LP21b and LP02 modes can be (de)multiplexed separately by using tapered mode converter from E13 (E31) mode to LP21b (LP02) mode.\n\nHaving a Brother or Sister with Down Syndrome: Perspectives from Siblings\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSkotko, Brian G.; Levine, Susan P.; Goldstein, Richard\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study asks brothers and sisters about their feelings and perceptions toward their sibling with Down syndrome. We analyzed valid and reliable surveys from 822 brothers and sisters whose families were on the mailing lists of six non-profit Down syndrome organizations around the country. More than 96% of brothers/sisters that responded to the survey indicated that they had affection toward their sibling with Down syndrome; and 94% of older siblings expressed feelings of pride. Less than 10% felt embarrassed, and less than 5% expressed a desire to trade their sibling in for another brother or sister without Down syndrome. Among older siblings, 88% felt that they were better people because of their siblings with Down syndrome, and more than 90% plan to remain involved in their siblingâs lives as they become adults. The vast majority of brothers and sisters describe their relationship with their sibling with Down syndrome as positive and enriching.

The mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. In this article, I provide a direct test pitting prenatal against postnatal (e.g., social/rearing) mechanisms. Four samples of homosexual and heterosexual men (total n = 944), including one sample of men raised in nonbiological and blended families (e.g., raised with half- or step-siblings or as adoptees) were studied. Only biological older brothers, and not any other sibling characteristic, including nonbiological older brothers, predicted men's sexual orientation, regardless of the amount of time reared with these siblings. These results strongly suggest a prenatal origin to the fraternal birth-order effect.\n\n77 FR 13483 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc (RR) Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-03-07\n\n...

It targets the detection of the optical counterparts of gravitational waves. The first three BlackGEM telescopes are planned to be installed in 2018 at the La Silla observatory (Chile). A single prototype telescope, named MeerLICHT, will already be commissioned early 2017 in Sutherland (South Africa) to provide an optical complement for the MeerKAT radio array. The BlackGEM array consists of, initially, a set of three robotic 65-cm wide-field telescopes. Each telescope is equipped with a single STA1600 CCD detector with 10.5k x 10.5k 9-micron pixels that covers a 2.7 square degrees field of view. The cryostats for housing these detectors are developed and built at the KU Leuven University (Belgium). The operational model of BlackGEM requires long periods of reliable hands-off operation. Therefore, we designed the cryostats for long vacuum hold time and we make use of a closed-cycle cooling system, based on Polycold PCC Joule-Thomson coolers. A single programmable logic controller (PLC) controls the cryogenic systems of several BlackGEM telescopes simultaneously, resulting in a highly reliable, cost-efficient and maintenance-friendly system. PLC-based cryostat control offers some distinct advantages, especially for a robotic facility. Apart of temperature monitoring and control, the PLC also monitors the vacuum quality, the power supply and the status of the PCC coolers (compressor power consumption and temperature, pressure in the gas lines, etc.). Furthermore, it provides an alarming system and safe and reproducible procedures for automatic cool down and warm up. The communication between PLC and higher-level software takes place via the OPC-UA protocol, offering a simple to implement, yet very powerful interface. Finally, a touch-panel display on the PLC provides the operator with a user-friendly and robust\n\nMixed pineal mature teratoma and germinoma in two brothers of the fraternal triplets.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrahovac, Gordan; Alden, Tord; Nitin, Wadhwani\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIntracranial teratomas are rare germ cell neoplasms that contain tissues derived from all three germ cell layers and most commonly occurring during childhood. This is the first report of pineal region mixed mature teratoma and germinoma in two fraternal brothers of fraternal triplets. We report the case of a mixed mature teratoma and germinoma of the pineal region in two brothers of fraternal triplets. Older brother was initially diagnosed at the age of 11Â years with the pure teratoma of the pineal region but the review of the pathology 3Â years after initial surgery revealed the mixed mature teratoma with 5% germinomatous component. The younger brother was diagnosed at the age of 13Â years with the mixed mature teratoma with 10% germinomatous component tumor of the pineal region. Younger brother has been treated with adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and older brother was treated without adjuvant therapy. Both brothers had no recurrence. Pineal mature teratomas have a good prognosis, in contrast to their immature or mixed counterparts. A rigorous histological examination of the tumor samples is mandatory, in order to not omit a mixed contingent within the tumor.\n\nElectromagnetic compatibility of PLC adapters for in-home/domestic networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPotisk, Lukas; Hallon, Jozef; Orgon, Milos; Fujdiak, Radek\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe use of programable logic controllers (PLC) technology in electrical networks 230 V causes electromagnetic radiation that interferes with other electrical equipment connected to the network [1-4].

It was conducted to minimize and overcome the coupling loss caused by lateral offset which is due to the process tolerance and the dimensional limitation existing between PLC device chips and fiber array blocks with groove structures. A PLC device chip and a fiber array block were simultaneously fabricated in a series of polymer replication processes using the original master. The dimensions (i.e., width and thickness) of the under-clad of the PLC device chip were identical to those of the fiber array block. The PLC device chip and optical fiber were aligned by simple positional control for the vertical direction of the PLC device chip under a particular condition. The insertion loss of the proposed 1 x 2 multimode optical splitter device interconnection was 4.0 dB at 850 nm and the coupling loss was below 0.1 dB compared with single-fiber based active alignment.\n\nRequirement of the Listeria monocytogenes broad-range phospholipase PC-PLC during infection of human epithelial cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrÃ¼ndling, Angelika; Gonzalez, Mark D; Higgins, Darren E\n\n2003-11-01\n\nIn this study, we investigated the requirement of the Listeria monocytogenes broad-range phospholipase C (PC-PLC) during infection of human epithelial cells. L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen of humans and a variety of animal species. After entering a host cell, L. monocytogenes is initially surrounded by a membrane-bound vacuole. Bacteria promote their escape from this vacuole, grow within the host cell cytosol, and spread from cell to cell via actin-based motility. Most infection studies with L. monocytogenes have been performed with mouse cells or an in vivo mouse model of infection. In all mouse-derived cells tested, the pore-forming cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) is absolutely required for lysis of primary vacuoles formed during host cell entry. However, L. monocytogenes can escape from primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO during infection of human epithelial cell lines Henle 407, HEp-2, and HeLa. Previous studies have shown that the broad-range phospholipase C, PC-PLC, promotes lysis of Henle 407 cell primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO. Here, we have shown that PC-PLC is also required for lysis of HEp-2 and HeLa cell primary vacuoles in the absence of LLO expression. Furthermore, our results indicated that the amount of PC-PLC activity is critical for the efficiency of vacuolar lysis. In an LLO-negative derivative of L. monocytogenes strain 10403S, expression of PC-PLC has to increase before or upon entry into human epithelial cells, compared to expression in broth culture, to allow bacterial escape from primary vacuoles. Using a system for inducible PC-PLC expression in L. monocytogenes, we provide evidence that phospholipase activity can be increased by elevated expression of PC-PLC or Mpl, the enzyme required for proteolytic activation of PC-PLC. Lastly, by using the inducible PC-PLC expression system, we demonstrate that, in the absence of LLO, PC-PLC activity is not only required for lysis of primary vacuoles in\n\n78 FR 37703 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-06-24\n\n...

S.; Indriani, A.; Hernadewita; Hermiyetti\n\n2018-02-01\n\nApplication of programmable logic control (PLC) is widely used on the control systems in the many field engineering such as automotive, aviation, food processing and other industries [1-2]. PLC is simply program to control many automatic activity, easy to use, flexible and others. PLC using the ladder program to solve and regulated the control system component. In previous research, PLC was used for control system of rotary dryer machine. In this paper PLC are used for control system of motion component in the rubber dryer machinery. Component of rubber dryer machine is motors, gearbox, sprocket, heater, drying chamber and bearing. Principle working of rubber dryer machinery is wet rubber moving into the drying chamber by sprocket. Sprocket is driven by motors that conducted by PLC to moving and set of wet rubber on the drying chamber. Drying system uses greenhouse effect by making hanger dryer design in the form of line path. In this paper focused on motion control system motors and sensors drying rubber using PLC. The results show that control system of rubber dryer machinery can work in accordance control input and the time required to dry the rubber.\n\nBinding of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-zeta (PLC-zeta) to phospholipid membranes: potential role of an unstructured cluster of basic residues.\n\nPubMed\n\nNomikos, Michail; Mulgrew-Nesbitt, Anna; Pallavi, Payal; Mihalyne, Gyongyi; Zaitseva, Irina; Swann, Karl; Lai, F Anthony; Murray, Diana; McLaughlin, Stuart\n\n2007-06-01\n\nPhospholipase C-zeta (PLC-zeta) is a sperm-specific enzyme that initiates the Ca2+ oscillations in mammalian eggs that activate embryo development. It shares considerable sequence homology with PLC-delta1, but lacks the PH domain that anchors PLC-delta1 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2. Thus it is unclear how PLC-zeta interacts with membranes. The linker region between the X and Y catalytic domains of PLC-zeta, however, contains a cluster of basic residues not present in PLC-delta1. Application of electrostatic theory to a homology model of PLC-zeta suggests this basic cluster could interact with acidic lipids. We measured the binding of catalytically competent mouse PLC-zeta to phospholipid vesicles: for 2:1 phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) vesicles, the molar partition coefficient, K, is too weak to be of physiological significance. Incorporating 1% PIP2 into the 2:1 PC/PS vesicles increases K about 10-fold, to 5x10(3) M-1, a biologically relevant value. Expressed fragments corresponding to the PLC-zeta X-Y linker region also bind with higher affinity to polyvalent than monovalent phosphoinositides on nitrocellulose filters. A peptide corresponding to the basic cluster (charge=+7) within the linker region, PLC-zeta-(374-385), binds to PC/PS vesicles with higher affinity than PLC-zeta, but its binding is less sensitive to incorporating PIP2. The acidic residues flanking this basic cluster in PLC-zeta may account for both these phenomena. FRET experiments suggest the basic cluster could not only anchor the protein to the membrane, but also enhance the local concentration of PIP2 adjacent to the catalytic domain.\n\nWho is the Effective Volunteer: Characteristics of Successful Big Brothers.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nThorelli, Irene M.; Appel, Victor H.\n\nThe demographic characteristics of the typical volunteer, taken from the personnel files of 208 current and previous volunteers of a Big Brothers agency, indicate the following profile.

While its functions as a regulator of both Ca 2+ signaling and PKC-family kinases are well characterized, PLC-Î³1's role in the regulation of early T-cell receptor signaling events is incompletely understood. Activation of the T-cell receptor leads to the formation of a signalosome complex between SLP-76, LAT, PLC-Î³1, Itk, and Vav1. Recent studies have revealed the existence of both positive and negative feedback pathways from SLP-76 to the apical kinase in the pathway, Lck. To determine if PLC-Î³1 contributes to the regulation of these feedback networks, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of PLC-Î³1-deficient T cells. These data revealed a previously unappreciated role for PLC-Î³1 in the positive regulation of Zap-70 and T-cell receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Conversely, PLC-Î³1 negatively regulated the phosphorylation of SLP-76-associated proteins, including previously established Lck substrate phosphorylation sites within this complex. While the positive and negative regulatory phosphorylation sites on Lck were largely unchanged, Tyr 192 phosphorylation was elevated in Jgamma1. The data supports a model wherein Lck's targeting, but not its kinase activity, is altered by PLC-Î³1, possibly through Lck Tyr 192 phosphorylation and increased association of the kinase with protein scaffolds SLP-76 and TSAd.\n\nDrs.

We have previously shown that the fungal elicitor xylanase induces a raise of SlPLC2 and SlPLC5 transcripts and that SlPLC2, but not SlPLC5, is required for xylanase-induced expression of defense-related genes. In this work we studied the role of SlPLC2 in the interaction between tomato and the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Inoculation of tomato leaves with B. cinerea increases SlPLC2 transcript levels. We knocked-down the expression of SlPLC2 by virus-induced gene silencing and plant defense responses were analyzed upon B. cinerea inoculation. SlPLC2 silenced plants developed smaller necrotic lesions concomitantly with less proliferation of the fungus. Silencing of SlPLC2 resulted as well in a reduced production of reactive oxygen species. Upon B.Â cinerea inoculation, transcript levels of the salicylic acid (SA)-defense pathway marker gene SlPR1a were diminished in SlPLC2 silenced plants compared to non-silenced infected plants, while transcripts of the jasmonic acid (JA)-defense gene markers Proteinase Inhibitor I and II (SlPI-I and SlPI-II) were increased. This implies that SlPLC2 participates in plant susceptibility to B. cinerea.

Particular for the Mercator Telescope is that it is controlled by a single high-end soft-PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). Using off-the-shelf components only, our distributed embedded system controls all subsystems of the telescope such as the pneumatic primary mirror support, the hydrostatic bearing, the telescope axes, the dome, the safety system, and so on. We show how real-time application logic can be written conveniently in typical PLC languages (IEC 61131-3) and in C++ (to implement the pointing kernel) using the commercial TwinCAT 3 programming environment. This software processes the inputs and outputs of the distributed system in real-time via an observatory-wide EtherCAT network, which is synchronized with high precision to an IEEE 1588 (PTP, Precision Time Protocol) time reference clock. Taking full advantage of the ability of soft-PLCs to run both real-time and non real-time software, the same device also hosts the most important user interfaces (HMIs or Human Machine Interfaces) and communication servers (OPC UA for process data, FTP for XML configuration data, and VNC for remote control). To manage the complexity of the system and to streamline the development process, we show how most of the software, electronics and systems engineering aspects of the control system have been modeled as a set of scripts written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL). When executed, these scripts populate a Knowledge Base (KB) which can be queried to retrieve specific information. By feeding the results of those queries to a template system, we were able to generate very detailed \"browsable\" web-based documentation about the system, but also PLC software code, Python client code, model verification reports, etc. The aim of this paper is to\n\n77 FR 32007 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-05-31\n\n...

The PLC implementation allows to reduce exploitation costs when constructing new info-communication networks. PLC is used for transmitting information between various devices in alternating current mains. There exist different approaches to transfer information over power lines. Their differences resulted from the requirements of typical apps which use PLC as a data transmission channel.

In this sense, the 1-4-5 inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) seem to be involved in the Ca2+ transient release induced by DhL in this species. We analyzed the involvement of phosphoinositide metabolism, especially the participation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and phospholipase C (PLC) in DhL-induced activation. Different doses of quinacrine, aristolochic acid (ATA) (PLA2 inhibitors) or neomycin, an antibiotic that binds to PIP2, thus preventing its hydrolysis, were used in mature Rhinella arenarum oocytes. In order to assay the participation of PI-PLC and PC- PLC we used U73122, a competitive inhibitor of PI-PLC dependent events and D609, an inhibitor of PC-PLC. We found that PLA2 inhibits quinacrine more effectively than ATA. This difference could be explained by the fact that quinacrine is not a specific inhibitor for PLA2 while ATA is specific for this enzyme. With respect to the participation of PLC, a higher decrease in oocyte activation was detected when cells were exposed to neomycin. Inhibition of PC-PLC with D609 and IP-PLC with U73122 indicated that the last PLC has a significant participation in the effect of DhL-induced activation. Results would indicate that DhL induces activation of in vitro matured oocytes of Rhinella arenarum by activation of IP-PLC, which in turn may induce IP3 formation which produces Ca2+ release.\n\nWright Brothers National Memorial : acoustical monitoring 2011\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2014-11-01\n\nDuring the winter of 2011(September - November) baseline acoustical data were collected at Wright Brothers National Memorial (WRBR) at two sites deployed for approximately 30 days each.

The traditional one has been unable to meet the functional requirements of the existing flexible traffic control system. This paper research and develop an intelligent traffic light called PLC control system. It uses PLC as control core, using a sensor module for receiving real-time information of vehicles, traffic control mode for information to select the traffic lights. Of which control mode is flexible and changeable, and it also set the countdown reminder to improve the effectiveness of traffic lights, which can realize the goal of intelligent traffic diversion, intelligent traffic diversion.\n\nBrother-sister incest: data from anonymous computer-assisted self interviews.\n\nPubMed\n\nStroebel, Sandra S; O'Keefe, Stephen L; Beard, Keith W; Kuo, Shih-Ya; Swindell, Samuel; Stroupe, Walter\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRetrospective data were entered anonymously by 1,521 adult women using computer-assisted self interview. Forty were classified as victims of brother-sister incest, 19 were classified as victims of father-daughter incest, and 232 were classified as victims of sexual abuse by an adult other than their father before reaching 18 years of age. The other 1,230 served as controls. The victims of brother-sister incest had significantly more problematic outcomes than controls on many measures (e.g., more likely than the controls to endorse feeling like damaged goods, thinking that they had suffered psychological injury, and having undergone psychological treatment for childhood sexual abuse). However, victims of brother-sister incest also had significantly less problematic outcomes than victims of father-daughter incest on some measures (e.g., significantly less likely than the father-daughter incest victims to endorse feeling like damaged goods, thinking that they had suffered psychological injury, and having undergone psychological treatment for childhood sexual abuse).\n\n76 FR 52288 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc (RR) Trent 800 Series Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-08-22\n\n...-0836; Directorate Identifier 2010-NE-38-AD] RIN 2120-AA64 Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc (RR... plc, P.O.

The study was carried out with 34 students in the Department of Industry Education and Technology at National Changhua University of Education in Taiwan. In total, 17 students were assigned to each group, experimental and control. Two laboratory exercises were designed to provide students with experience in PLC programming. The results show that the experiments supported by Multiprog virtual laboratory user-friendly control interfaces generate positive meaningful results in regard to students' knowledge and understanding of the material.\n\nJohn Bell (1763-1820): brother artist and anatomist.\n\nPubMed\n\nGardner-Thorpe, Christopher\n\n2013-01-01\n\nJohn Bell, brother-surgeon of Charles Bell, was, like Charles, an outstanding surgeon and a good artist. John was one of the few who illustrated his work with their own drawings in the days before audiovisual aids were available and without the benefit of reliable drawing aids, photography and computer-aided design. Charles, on the other hand, was the better artist and illustrated much of the normal anatomy of the nervous system. Each brother undertook extensive surgery of men who had been wounded in war; John Bell left us his engravings from the textbooks, more numerous perhaps than Charles, but Charles left us a series of oil paintings and watercolours in addition to the illustrations in his textbooks.

Sir William or \"Thornley,\" as he was commonly known, was one of Ireland's leading physicians. He performed some of the first brain surgeries in Ireland using Sir David Ferrier's maps of the cerebral cortex. From 1879 into the twentieth century, Thornley served as inspector for Ireland under the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act. In this role, Thornley was responsible for granting licenses to researchers who performed experiments on live animals. Due to his reservations about animal experimentation, Thornley eventually became an advocate for the antivivisection cause, testifying at the second Royal Commission on Vivisection (1906-1912). Thornley also influenced Irish literature, albeit indirectly. Bram Stoker's composition notes for Dracula show that he consulted his older brother about the medical scenes in his novel. Thornley's knowledge of cerebral localization and his animal rights advocacy both surface in Dracula. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition blocks lymphocyte adherence to and spreading on fibronectin. In contrast, putative PLC inhibitors yield distinct differences with respect to adhesion and morphology. The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor neomycin blocked spreading of CD3/CD28-activated T cells on fibronectin by disrupting adhesion. Furthermore, when an additional inside-out signal for fibronectin adhesion is unnecessary such as with HPB-ALL T leukemic or phorbol-myristate-acetate-treated normal T cells, neomycin treatment does not alter adhesion or morphology. However, the phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC inhibitor D609 abrogates cell spreading without affecting adhesion to fibronectin in these cells as well as the CD3/CD28-activated T cells. These results strongly suggest that inside-out signaling for the integrin alpha4beta1 in lymphocytes proceeds through phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC and PKC, whereas the outside-in signal utilizes phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC and PKC.\n\n76 FR 30529 - Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce plc (RR) RB211-535 Series Turbofan Engines\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-05-26\n\n...

The pistil-S gene encodes a polymorphic ribonuclease (S-RNase), which is essential for identifying self-pollen. However, the S-RNase system has not been fully characterized. In this study, the self-S-RNase inhibited the Ca 2+ -permeable channel activity at pollen tube apices and the selectively decreased phospholipase C ( PLC ) activity in the plasma membrane of Pyrus pyrifolia pollen tubes. Self-S-RNase decreased the Ca 2+ influx through a PLC -mediated signaling pathway. Phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC has a 26-amino acid insertion in pollen tubes of the 'Jinzhuili' cultivar, which is a spontaneous self-compatible mutant of the 'Yali' cultivar. 'Yali' plants exhibit a typical S-RNase-based GSI. Upon self-pollination, PLC gene expression is significantly higher in 'Jinzhuili' pollen tubes than that in 'Yali' pollen tubes. Moreover, the PLC in pollen tubes can only interact with one of the two types of S-RNase from the style. In the Pyrus x bretschneideri Rehd, the PLC directly interacted with the S 7 -RNase in the pollen tube, but not with the S 34 -RNase. Collectively, our results reveal that the effects of S-RNase on PLC activity are required for S-specific pollen rejection, an"
