        "text": "DATE December 13, 2002 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Former President Jimmy Carter discusses his work as a\n\nmediator, his life in the White House and his spiritual life\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, filling in for Terry Gross.\n\nWhen I was a college senior at the University of Florida in 1975 taking an\n\napplied journalism course at the local newspaper, the Gainesville Sun, this\n\nweird guy walked into the newsroom one day. He was carrying a giant clear\n\ntrash bag full of unshelled peanuts and handing them out to anybody he met.\n\n`I'm Jimmy Carter,' he said with each handful, `and I'm runnin' for president\n\nof the United States.'\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter achieved that goal a year later. And this week,\n\n22 years after leaving the White House, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. He\n\nwas cited for his role in the Camp David accord between Israel and Egypt in\n\n1978 and for his later humanitarian work with the Carter Center, a private\n\nfoundation dedicated to promoting peace.\n\nOn today's FRESH AIR, we'll listen back to excerpts of several of our\n\ninterviews with him.\n\nJimmy Carter has been one of the most sought-after mediators in the world,\n\nthough he also has been criticized for cutting favorable deals with dictators.\n\nIn Haiti, he negotiated an agreement with the military rulers which averted a\n\nUS invasion. Carter negotiated a cease-fire in Bosnia with the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nIn North Korea, Carter helped defuse a nuclear crisis by negotiating a\n\ncommitment with dictator Kim Il Sung to freeze their nuclear program.\n\nAlthough, as recent relations between North Korea and the US have declined,\n\nNorth Korea has just announced they are rolling back on some of the\n\nrestrictions that were negotiated in 1994.\n\nIn 1995, Jimmy Carter told Terry Gross that he gets calls almost every month\n\nasking him to mediate conflicts. Terry asked him then what criteria he uses\n\nto decide if he'll accept an invitation.\n\n(Soundbite of 1995 broadcast)\n\nFormer President JIMMY CARTER: Well, the first thing is that we have to be\n\nable to induce both sides to accept our presence. Usually we get a request on\n\nimportunity from one side, and then we go to the other side and say, `Are you\n\nwilling now for us to participate? Do you really want to solve this problem\n\nin a peaceful way instead through continued war or the eruption of war?'\n\nThat's a first step.\n\nThe second step is to get permission or approval from my own government,\n\neither from the State Department or the White House. And in most cases, we\n\nare better able to get approval from the White House, because the State\n\nDepartment is an enormous bureaucracy, and there is at least an insinuation in\n\ntheir mind that if some outsider comes in to address a problem that it means\n\nthat they have failed in their duties. So in most cases that have been highly\n\npublicized recently, we've had approval from President Clinton and some of\n\nhis subordinates, but some opposition from other places within the government.\n\nGROSS: When you know that someone who you're about to negotiate with has\n\nviolated all the promises they made in the past, how does that affect the way\n\nyou handle the negotiations and the way you handle a promise that they are\n\nready to make or a treaty that they're ready to offer?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, quite often, we find that both sides violate agreements\n\nand that the media coverage in our country is quite bias. We tend to have\n\nheroes and villains. And the heroes can do no wrong, and the villains can do\n\nno right. What we do at the Carter Center is analyze all the world's\n\nconflicts. There are about 32 major wars now, and we try to learn on a\n\nsustained basis the causes of those conflicts, the people involved, the issues\n\nthat must be addressed and so forth. And almost invariably, these wars are\n\ncivil wars within a country. And except on rare occasions, where the United\n\nNations Security Council has actually acted, it's not proper at all for a UN\n\nofficial even to talk to a revolutionary who's trying to overthrow a\n\ngovernment that's a member of the United Nations. So we go where others don't\n\nwant to go. And at the time we went to North Korea, there was actually a law\n\nin effect that prevented any American from going to Pyongyang to talk to the\n\nofficials there. And as you know, we were on the verge of a mass invasion in\n\nHaiti when we went down to Haiti.\n\nSo we try to keep an open mind, not condoning what has been done in the past,\n\nbut setting up the procedure so that at the end of the mediation process, both\n\nsides win. If one side wins and the other side loses, then there's no way\n\nthat an agreement can be preserved.\n\nGROSS: When you went to negotiate in Bosnia, Leon Panetta, the White House\n\nChief of Staff, put it like this. He said, `The Serb motives are suspect.'\n\nAnd I'm certain many people agreed with him when he said that. You know, a\n\nlot of skeptics say that tyrants ask you to come, because they think they'll\n\nget a better deal out of you. So what do you say to that?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, I don't have any deals to offer, and I never go without\n\nthe approval of my government. And I never deviate from the policies of my\n\ngovernment. And I'm not only very familiar with the reasons and background\n\nand personalities involved in conflicts, but I'm also very careful that I'm\n\nthoroughly familiar with my own nation's policy before I go into an arena of\n\nthis kind. I've never deviate from that. Also, I don't want any authority.\n\nI have zero authority. I just go as a private citizen, as a professor at\n\nEmory University, as a member of the Carter Center. And this is very\n\nimportant to me. When I conclude any sort of agreement, it has to be approved\n\nword-by-word with the authorities in charge of both sides to a dispute, or in\n\nthis particular case, by the United Nations representatives there and also by\n\nmy government.\n\nFor instance, when we negotiated at the last minute after an attack had\n\nalready been launched against Haiti, every word in the agreement that I worked\n\nout there with Emile Jonassaint, the provisional president, was approved by a\n\ngroup of people in the Oval Office, including the president and the vice\n\npresident, the secretary of state and a national security adviser.\n\nSo I don't need any authority. I don't want any authority. I don't have\n\nanything to offer. I try to represent the Carter Center well and make sure\n\nthat everything I do is completely compatible with the policies of my\n\ngovernment.\n\nGROSS: Let me ask you a question that I'm sure a lot of people have wondered\n\nabout. You have such a strong human rights record. What is it like for you\n\nto sit opposite someone, like Karadzic, knowing the war crimes that he's\n\nguilty of? Is it more difficult for you to negotiate with somebody who you\n\nthink of as a tyrant?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, there are two or three phases. One is the preparation for\n\nit. And the second phase, after I get there, is an extensive listening\n\nprocess. I have to listen to their position and understand them and then I\n\nweigh in with basic demands. My rationality, if I need any of it, is that if\n\na war is going on, we terminate the war. If a war is imminent, as it was the\n\ncase in Haiti and North Korea, we try to prevent the war. If terrible human\n\nrights violations have occurred in the past, we try to make an environment\n\npossible within which the human rights violations will be totally eliminated\n\nor dramatically reduced. And I think that's a standard that we fill. And\n\nwhether someone has been guilty in the past of starting a war or committing\n\nhuman rights atrocities is obviously a very serious matter for us to consider,\n\nbut we try to end those practices and bring peace and the alleviation of human\n\nrights suffering.\n\nGROSS: Do you have to enter negotiations with someone who is a tyrant in a\n\nfairly non-judgmental way and be as cordial and open as you possibly can.\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, I'm cordial and open. The only thing I have to offer is my\n\nown integrity and an element of objectivity. I don't have any ax to grind.\n\nMy ax to grind is to try to bring peace and an end to human rights abuses.\n\nBut it doesn't mean that I go in ignorant of past crimes, and I have to just\n\nrealize that these people have committed crimes. In most cases, crimes have\n\nbeen committed on both sides. They may be much more onerous on one side than\n\nthe other. But quite often, it's the scorned person or the despised person or\n\nthe unsavory people in international judgement that will need someone to\n\nlisten to their position, as was the case with Kim Il Sung and with the\n\nprovisional government in Haiti and as was the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nBIANCULLI: Jimmy Carter speaking in 1995 with Terry Gross. Carter accepted\n\nthe Nobel Peace Prize this week. We'll hear more from Jimmy Carter after a\n\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBIANCULLI: Jimmy Carter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize earlier this week.\n\nIn 1993, Terry asked him about becoming president.\n\n(Soundbite of 1993 broadcast)\n\nGROSS: What was the most disorienting part of your first day and night in the\n\nWhite House?\n\nMr. CARTER: I had pretty well gotten my Cabinet firmed up quite early after\n\nthe election and what do you do the next day to deal with a multitude of\n\nissues. I had a very find agenda. I couldn't get much support originally\n\nfrom the Congress, although finally my batting average was about the same as\n\nLyndon Johnson's or John Kennedy.\n\nYou know, what do you when you get in the Oval Office? I hardly knew where it\n\nwas, though I had visited it once before. President Ford invited me in to see\n\nthe Oval Office after I had won the election. I would have to say, though, as\n\na bottom line that I was quite confident of myself. I wasn't plagued with\n\ntrepidation that I was inadequate for the job. That may be presumptuous, but\n\nanybody who decides I want to be president of this great country has to be\n\nsomewhat presumptuous.\n\nSo I wasn't plagued with an inferiority complex. I felt that no matter what\n\ncame up that I could handle it as well as anyone.\n\nGROSS: And what about during the hostage crisis? Was there every a point\n\nwhere you wished that you weren't president, or you wish that you didn't have\n\nthis terrible burden on your shoulders?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, you know, about 2:00 in the morning in April when we tried\n\nthe rescue operation and we couldn't succeed, that was perhaps the high point\n\nof despair in my presidency. And I knew that I had to get up early the next\n\nmorning about 6:00 and prepare to go on all the morning talk shows and explain\n\nto the American people that the rescue operation had failed. That was a very\n\ndismal point. Also, we knew that an accident had occurred and that one of the\n\nhelicopters had flown into an airplane and that eight people had died, and I\n\nhad to notify those families during the night that their loved ones had\n\nperished in a secret operation. There's no way that anything else that\n\nhappened during the four years could equal that as a time of discouragement\n\nand despair.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. You told us a little bit about what your inauguration day was\n\nlike. Let's skip ahead to the inauguration of your successor, Ronald Reagan.\n\nWhat were you feeling that day as you realized that the hostages were going to\n\nbe released on his watch, not on yours?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, I didn't realize that. I had not been to bed for three\n\ndays and had negotiated in the most meticulous detail the release of the\n\nhostages. Everything was all agreed and the hostages were in the airplane\n\nready to take off at 10:00 that morning Washington time. So we were just\n\nwaiting to get word that they had cleared Iranian airspace. And when I went\n\nto the reviewing stand when I relinquished the presidency to Reagan and he\n\nmade his inaugural speech--before I left the reviewing stand, I was informed\n\nthat the plane had, indeed, taken off and the hostages were all safe and free.\n\nI have to say that I didn't even think about the fact that it happened a few\n\nminutes after midnight--I mean, after noontime, I just knew that they were\n\nfree. And that was one of the most glorious and happy moments of my entire\n\nlife.\n\nGROSS: Even though it wasn't on your watch.\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, to me, I didn't even think about it, but obviously that\n\nbecame the major story among the news media that it had happened about 20\n\nminutes after I was no longer president. To me that was insignificant, but it\n\nhas still prevailed. Even your question indicates that it was a historically\n\nimportant fact that it happened a few minutes after I left the White House as\n\na president rather than while I was, you know, still in office.\n\nGROSS: My guest is former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nJimmy Carter, before we go any further, I'm going to ask you for a little\n\nlesson in etiquette. Do I call you President Carter, Mr. President or former\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter? What is the appropriate etiquette when you're talking\n\nto a former president of the United States?\n\nMr. CARTER: You know, one of the nice things about our country is you can\n\ncall me anything you want to. Jimmy suits me OK. There is a custom in our\n\nnation that if you have been a governor or ambassador or a judge or a\n\npresident, then you can still retain the title. So if you want to call me\n\npresident you can, if you want to call me Jimmy, that's fine.\n\nYou know, when I go through Georgia's small towns and somebody is an old\n\nfriend of mine, I know it immediately when they say, `Hi, Governor.' They\n\ncall me--that's one of the most intimate relationships. And the little kids\n\naround Plains when I ride a bicycle or job by, if they are very devout or if\n\ntheir families go to church every Sunday, they call me `Brother Jimmy.'\n\n`Hello, Brother Jimmy.' And a lot of them just call me, `Hello, Jimmy\n\nCarter.' But it doesn't matter to me. I never was much dependent on the pomp\n\nand ceremony of the White House even when I was there, and so Jimmy suits me\n\nfine.\n\nBIANCULLI: Jimmy Carter speaking with Terry Gross in 1993.\n\nCarter is a born-again Christian and his religious beliefs have always been an\n\nimportant part of his life. In 1996, Terry spoke with him about his book\n\n\"Living Faith.\"\n\n(Soundbite of 1996 broadcast)\n\nGROSS: How did you approach your prayer life in the White House? You say in\n\nyour book that other presidents have brought in Billy Graham to organize, you\n\nknow, a worship for them, but you didn't want to do that in the White House.\n\nYou thought it was a--it violated your sense of separation of church and\n\nstate. So what did you do?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, I worshiped as I would if I had not been in public life at\n\nall. I went to Sunday services at the First Baptist Church in Washington,\n\nwhich was the nearest Baptist church to the White House. Most of the weekends\n\nwe tried to go to Camp David. We had a chaplain from a nearby Army base come\n\nand preach a sermon. We sang hymns together.\n\nAnd as far as my personal prayer life was concerned, I would say it was much\n\nmore frequent, maybe on the average more heartfelt than any other time in my\n\nlife because I felt that the decisions I made were affecting the lives of\n\nhundreds of millions of people. I never prayed for popularity, I never prayed\n\nto be re-elected, things of that kind. I prayed that I could keep my nation\n\nat peace, I prayed that I could extend the advantages of peace to other\n\npeople, say, between Egypt and Israel at Camp David. When the hostage crisis\n\ncame along, the prayer that I made was that all the hostages would come back\n\nhome safe and free, that I would not betray the principles of my nation or do\n\nanything to embarrass it. And I think in all those cases my prayers were\n\nanswered.\n\nI think God always answers our prayers. Quite often God's answer is, `No.'\n\nWe don't get what we ask for. And then the obligation, if we have faith, is\n\nto find out within ourselves why. Are we asking for selfish things? Are we\n\nasking for things that are unjustified? Are we asking for things that ought\n\nto be granted in the future? Should we change the priorities in our lives?\n\nAre our prayers in accordance with God's will? Those are the kind of things\n\nthat I've learned over a long lifetime, as you know, and those are the things\n\nI try to describe in \"Living Faith.\"\n\nGROSS: What was your sense of prayer when you were a child, and how has your\n\nsense of prayer changed as an adult?\n\nMr. CARTER: Well, when I was a child, say when I reached the age of 10 or\n\nteen-age life, I had some very serious doubts about what I heard in church,\n\nwhat I heard in Sunday school, what I heard my own father teaching. But I\n\nwouldn't express my doubts to anybody. And I thought I was very sinful not to\n\nhave absolute and total faith. Now my faith is stronger. I can see the\n\nvarious aspects of a deep Christian faith. I realize that as I was at the age\n\nof 15, I'm still searching, I'm still trying to learn. I'm still trying to\n\nstretch my heart, stretch my mind. I learned two or three times in my life\n\nthat my faith could sustain total doubt in God. I rejected God a few times.\n\nI felt that God had betrayed me, that I could not depend on my faith at all.\n\nAnd I had to go through a very difficult and unpleasant healing process.\n\nI've learned over a period of a long lifetime, 50 years of marriage with\n\nRosalynn, how sadly mistaken I was in dealing with her. When we first got\n\nmarried, I was an arrogant, young, Naval Academy graduate. Rosalynn was a\n\nvery shy, timid, younger person from Plains, Georgia. I totally dominated\n\nher. I didn't show any sensitivity when she was distressed. I was just\n\nimpatient. When decisions were to be made about our family's life, I didn't\n\nconsult with her. I just made a decision and informed her about what we were\n\ngoing to do. And that was in my formative stage as a mature human being.\n\nI've learned to correct some of those mistakes. So prayer life for me has\n\nparalleled in awareness and in growth and in significant in my evolution as a\n\nhuman being. And I hope that I'll continue to improve in the remaining years\n\nthat I have.\n\nBIANCULLI: Jimmy Carter, speaking with Terry Gross in 1996. Carter was\n\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize this week.\n\nI'm David Bianculli, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nBIANCULLI: Coming up, playwright and actor Sam Shepard talks about his fear\n\nof flying, a surprising phobia for the actor who played fearless test pilot\n\nChuck Yeager in \"The Right Stuff.\" Shepard has a new collection of short\n\nstories. And John Powers reviews \"About Schmidt,\" the new film starring Jack\n\nNicholson.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Actor Sam Shepard discusses his career in theater and\n\nfilm\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nPlaywright Sam Shepard was described in Esquire magazine as creating\n\nquintessential American characters in the idioms of rock, sci-fi and the Wild\n\nWest. As an actor, Shepard starred in such films as \"The Right Stuff,\"\n\n\"Crimes of the Heart,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Country\" and Terrence Malick's\n\n\"Days of Heaven.\" He wrote the screenplay for \"Paris, Texas.\" His plays\n\ninclude \"Fool for Love,\" \"True West,\" and \"Buried Child,\" which won a Pulitzer\n\nPrize in 1979. His new collection of short stories, \"Great Dream of Heaven,\"\n\nhas just been published. In the past, Shepard has written about his fear of\n\nflying, which not only goes against his iconic image, it's a stark contrast to\n\nhis portrayal of test pilot Chuck Yeager in \"The Right Stuff.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Right Stuff\")\n\nUnidentified Man: Say there, Yeager.\n\nMr. SAM SHEPARD (\"Chuck Yeager\"): Sir.\n\nUnidentified Man: We were just talking to Slick here about the sound barrier.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Is that right?\n\nUnidentified Man: And we feel that the X-1 is ready to have a go at it.\n\n\"SLICK\": We think the X-1 has got the answer to go beyond Mach 1.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: If there is any beyond.\n\nUnidentified Man: And so what do you think, Yeager?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, I'll tell you what, half these engineers never been off\n\nthe ground, you know? I mean, they're liable to tell you that the sound\n\nbarrier's a brick wall in the sky, it'll rip your ears off if you try to go\n\nthrough it. If you ask me, I don't believe the damn thing even exists.\n\n\"SLICK\": Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager here.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: No, thanks. I got one.\n\n\"SLICK\": So do you think you want to have a go at it?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I might.\n\n\"SLICK\": But since, as you say, this sound barrier doesn't really exist, how\n\nmuch...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: How much you got? I'm just joking. The Air Force is paying me\n\nalready, ain't that right, sir?\n\nUnidentified Man: Why sure, Yeager. But...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: So when do we go?\n\nBIANCULLI: Sam Shepard spoke with Terry Gross in 1998.\n\n(Soundbite of 1998 interview)\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I got to meet Chuck Yeager, you know, when I was shooting \"The\n\nRight Stuff,\" and he's a man who's known for impeccable courage and all the\n\nrest of it. And I got to talking to him about flying and all that, and he\n\nsays it's not true that you don't have fear. You know, fear is part and\n\nparcel of the thing that you take on, is that you're able to face it, you\n\nknow? To me, that's the interesting part about courage, you know? It's not\n\nthat you don't have fear, it's that you look it in the eye, you know?\n\nTERRY GROSS reporting:\n\nBut Chuck Yeager went on to be, you know, a famous test pilot. You played him\n\nin \"The Right Stuff.\" But you don't go up in planes yourself, right?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I do occasionally. I'm getting better at it, actually. I go\n\nto Mexico once a year, stuff like that. It's just that I'm not crazy about\n\nit, you know? And it's a funny thing because I grew up in a kind of rural\n\nsituation, and most of the people that I've talked to from that kind of\n\nbackground are terrified of flying, and I always thought that was curious, you\n\nknow, that people who had a background of being sort of stuck in the land\n\ndon't like to get up in airplanes. And I don't know if that's just a\n\ncoincidence or--you know what I mean?\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I have a farmer friend of mine who, once a year, flies to Las\n\nVegas to have a go at the one-armed bandits, and he can't stand airplanes; he\n\nhates them.\n\nGROSS: Did you...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: But he goes, you know?\n\nGROSS: Now did playing Chuck Yeager have any effect on you and flying?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: An effect on me and flying? No. I went up with him, actually,\n\nonce in a little Piper Cub over the desert because I thought, you know, if I'm\n\ngoing to crash, I might as well go down with the world's greatest pilot. So\n\nwe went to this hangar, and he took this little hook that looked like an\n\numbrella handle and pulled this airplane out of the hangar by hand. And it\n\nwas a single-prop plane. We jumped into the damn thing and took off, and I\n\ncouldn't believe it, I felt great. It was a great feeling. We kind of\n\nhovered over the desert and he showed me different stuff, you know, where he\n\nhung out in his Air Force days. And that was fun.\n\nGROSS: Now I know your father was a bomber pilot in World War II. I'm\n\nwondering...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...if that had any impact on you and if you...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Oh, I'm sure it did.\n\nGROSS: Did you hear a lot of scary stories about nearly being shot down\n\nduring the war?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, he--yeah, he had quite a few scrapes. He had a bunch of\n\nshrapnel hit him and stuff, and one time they had a belly gunner--you know, in\n\nthose old big planes, they had these glass turrets underneath the fuselage\n\nwith the machine gun turret. And one of his buddies was in that while he was\n\nflying the bomber, and the turret got shot off, and he saw his pal go down,\n\nyou know; stuff like that. I don't know. I guess it gives you little\n\nnightmares when you're a kid and stuff. I suppose it has affected me, but I'm\n\nnot sure how.\n\nGROSS: Well, what effect do you think it has on your career? You know, a lot\n\nof people, especially those who don't live in LA...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: The fear of flying in my career?\n\nGROSS: Yeah, yeah...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Is that what you're asking me?\n\nGROSS: Yeah, because, you know, if you're an actor and you don't live in LA,\n\nwell, you know, you can fly there when you get the part.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Oh, I see.\n\nGROSS: But if you don't like to fly...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I see what you mean. I see.\n\nGROSS: ...it's really a burden to get there...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...particularly on short notice or to go back...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I thought you meant the...\n\nGROSS: ...and forth. You know, a lot of people, like, bicoastal...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...always flying back and forth between New York and LA. You've got\n\nplays in New York and movie jobs in LA and...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah, it slows things down, but I enjoy driving. In fact, I\n\njust drove to British Columbia to do a film and got stuck in that big blizzard\n\nin South Dakota coming back. But it was kind of neat, you know? I stayed two\n\ndays in Wyoming in Sheridan and Gillette, you know, while the winds were\n\nblowing 50 miles an hour, and it was kind of interesting.\n\nGROSS: Now some of your plays have dealt with family upheaval, family\n\nviolence. You left your family, as a teen-ager you left home. That...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I did. I was driven out.\n\nGROSS: Driven out by your parents?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, that's unfair to say. I mean, I left in a kind of\n\nholocaust of my old man, you know? He destroyed the house and I decided it\n\nwas time to go.\n\nGROSS: What did your father do that destroyed the home?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: What did he do?\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Broke windows, tore the doors off, stuff like that.\n\nGROSS: Oh, literally destroyed the house.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah, physically.\n\nGROSS: Huh. How'd your mother handle that? She didn't run away with you.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: She's a very brave soul.\n\nGROSS: Was your father very strict when you were growing up? Were there a\n\nlot of rules you were supposed to follow?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. He was. Uh-huh.\n\nGROSS: What were the rules?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: He was an Air Force guy, you know?\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Crew cut and all that stuff.\n\nGROSS: So what were the rules you were supposed to obey as a kid?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: What were the rules I was supposed to obey--never show any\n\nfeeling was one of the rules.\n\nGROSS: Now I think there's a kind of hard-boiled quality about some of your\n\ncharacters, so that even if they don't kind of openly express a lot of\n\nemotion, they're also vulnerable, but in a hard-boiled way, as opposed to in a\n\nway where they don't express emotion but, you know, behind closed doors they'd\n\nbe crying or something. Do you know what I mean?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And I'm wondering if you thought of yourself as having that\n\nhard-boiled quality when you were still in the house with your parents, kind\n\nof in a house ruled by your father?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: No, I never as a kid thought of myself as hard boiled. That\n\ncame later. Under the influence of my old man and the family situation and\n\nall that, I never for a second believed that I was that tough, you know? You\n\ncan't--as a child, you don't think of yourself as tough. I mean, you may be\n\nable to bear certain things, but I just never had that kind of image of myself\n\nas a tough kid.\n\nGROSS: When your father was tearing doors off hinges and breaking windows,\n\nwas he beating you up, too?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Now and then, you know? Yeah. But, I mean, I wouldn't say\n\nthat I had a particularly horrendous childhood compared to the modern kids,\n\nyou know? I think the modern kids probably have it worse, you know, having\n\nsometimes no fatherly influence at all, you know?\n\nBIANCULLI: Sam Shepard talking with Terry Gross in 1998. He has a new\n\ncollection of short stories. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBIANCULLI: Let's get back to Terry Gross' interview with Sam Shepard,\n\nrecorded in 1998.\n\n(Soundbite of 1998 interview)\n\nGROSS: When you were young, did you find any resonance in books or movies,\n\nyou know? With the situation that you were in, did you gravitate to books or\n\nmovies that seemed to describe families similar to yours? Or did you look for\n\nsomething completely different in books and movies?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, now I was--it was funny. When I was in high school, we\n\nwere out in the middle of the boondocks, you know, and there was a little\n\nbitty art house theater, I remember, out in a place called Kookamonga.\n\nAnd...\n\nGROSS: Oh, wow. You really lived near a place called Kookamonga?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You remember on \"The Jack Benny Show,\" it was always...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah, right.\n\nGROSS: ...the bus announcer was always saying, `And Kookamonga.'\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. There really is a Kookamonga. It was surrounded by\n\nvineyards, you know, and for some reason or another, there was this little\n\nbitty art house there and they'd show foreign films, which was just\n\nunbelievable in those days 'cause there wasn't anything around but \"Ben-Hur\"\n\nand, you know, \"Cleopatra\" and all those kind of things. So me and a couple\n\nof buddies of mine would go out there. And I saw a film called \"Four Hundred\n\nBlows\" by Truffaut, black and white film, and that really stunned me, you\n\nknow? It was, like, whoa. You know, this kid--I saw a lot of similarities\n\nin that between my situation and that, you know?\n\nGROSS: He's sent to reform school in that.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. Yeah. He had a pretty rough deal.\n\nGROSS: So you were seeing art films in Kookamonga. Wow.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah, art films--you imagine that?\n\nGROSS: So were you seeing plays or reading plays?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: No. Huh-uh. Yeah, I'd read some O'Neill.\n\nGROSS: Talk about family drama.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. Some of his one-act stuff. And then I saw the film\n\nbased on \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" which I thought was an amazing film,\n\nyou know, particularly since it was based on a play. I don't think most plays\n\nmake good movies, but in that case, it was incredible performances, you know?\n\nGROSS: Now you started off acting in--I think it was a small repertory\n\ncompany that basically toured churches.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. When I first left home, I got this paper route, and I\n\nwas delivering papers out of a '51 Chevy. And I was throwing papers along the\n\nhouses and stuff, and at the end of the day, I started going through the\n\npaper, and at the end of it in the work section, there was this little ad that\n\nsaid `actors wanted.' And I went in and auditioned for this company. It's\n\ncalled the Bishops Company. And the great thing about it was it was a\n\ntraveling company. It was going to get the hell out of there, you know? And\n\nso they hired me and the next day I was on a Greyhound bus to Bethlehem,\n\nPennsylvania, and joined up with the company there. And we toured all over\n\nthe place and did these one-night stands in churches, which was my first real\n\nexperience with theater.\n\nGROSS: It's funny, 'cause you went, you know, from churches eventually to\n\noff-Broadway at a time when off-Broadway was, you know, very avant garde for\n\nits time, so it's an interesting contrast. Playing the church circuit must\n\nhave been an interesting way to see the country and get started acting.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah, and also to see probably the last of that kind of '50s\n\nculture, although it was the '60s, you know? It was still the '50s feel about\n\nit, you know, that culture in small-town America. It was pretty amazing.\n\nGROSS: So you went to New York. I think it was in 1963.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: What was it like to be--I think you were living or at least working in\n\nGreenwich Village. Was this your first exposure to an avant garde and to a\n\nbohemian life, to a life that was radically different from the kind of\n\nmilitary life that you grew up in and also radically different from the\n\nchurches that you were touring?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was. I was suddenly on the Lower East Side on\n\nAvenue C and 10th Street living with jazz musicians.\n\nGROSS: Well, I think your roommate was Charles Mingus' son.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. Yeah, I'd gone to high school with him, and he was\n\nworking in a place called the Village Gate and got me a job there as a bus\n\nboy. So that's how I got initiated into New York.\n\nGROSS: Were you a good bus boy?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Oh, yeah, excellent. I got fired because I'd knocked over a\n\ncandle on a guy's suit, and that was the end of that job.\n\nGROSS: Right. Right.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: But in the course of that, I got to see probably the most\n\namazing musicians of their time, you know, like the Adderley brothers and\n\nMingus and Thelonious Monk and Gerry Mulligan. It was just a free show, you\n\nknow?\n\nGROSS: Yeah, 'cause the Village Gate was a club.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: In the '60s, everybody wrote about you as like the new bright hope of\n\noff-Broadway. What was off-Broadway like when you started writing plays for\n\noff-Broadway?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, obviously it was so poverty stricken that they had to\n\npick on me. No. I don't really know anything about off-Broadway at that time\n\nbecause I didn't try to--you know, it was commercial in its own way as\n\nBroadway was. You know, it was as forbidding as Broadway as far as opening\n\nthe door to it. And I just was lucky in the fact that all of these little\n\ncafes and churches and stuff were starting to open up to, you know, a\n\nbrand-new way of theater.\n\nGROSS: Did you want to act in your own plays? Did you see that as a\n\npossibility for yourself?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: No.\n\nGROSS: Why not?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: I don't know. It seems like the height of vanity to me, you\n\nknow? Acting and writing and directing--you know what I mean? I just--it's\n\nembarrassing.\n\nGROSS: Hmm. And that's what kept you from doing it, thinking that it was\n\nvain?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Just--yeah, in some ways, I suppose. Of course, that's kind of\n\nvain, too, to think that. But, you know, it was just--and the other side of\n\nit, too, was I kind of liked seeing the writing from the outside. I liked\n\nseeing an actor play it, where I don't think you can really see the writing if\n\nyou're inside it.\n\nGROSS: When you're writing lines for a play, do you speak the lines out loud\n\nto just hear how they sound spoken?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Sometimes. Sometimes, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Now when you're writing dialogue for plays, do you ever hear a certain\n\nmusicality in a line, like where you hear the accent, where you hear the\n\nemphasis as being, and then the actor does it completely differently than\n\nthat, and...\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...maybe it works but maybe it doesn't work for you? Maybe you feel\n\nlike your intention was kind of lost. Will you say something to the actor\n\nabout that if you do feel that the music you're hearing is lost?\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, yeah, but I think more often, particularly if you have\n\ngood actors like, for instance, Malkovich and Ed Harris and Jim Gammon and\n\nthese great actors that I've had the good fortune to get, they often will land\n\nthings in an unexpected way that's not only surprising but right, you know, I\n\nmean, much more right than you could have intended, you know? In other words,\n\nthey bring the intention of the writing into another domain. Malkovich has\n\nthe uncanny ability to do that.\n\nGROSS: Any general impressions about most screenplays that you read now,\n\nabout how well they're written.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Oh, boy. Well, my main problem with screenplays nowadays, you\n\nknow, most of the ones I've seen is that there are no characters whatsoever in\n\nthem. That's my main problem with them. You just don't find any characters.\n\nYou find these formulas. You find these sort of Hollywood rituals going on,\n\nbut you don't find characters. Every once in a while you do. I mean, I don't\n\nwant to be too harsh. But many, many of the characters don't even feel human.\n\nThey feel computerized or faxed or, you know, somebody's mailed it in. And\n\nthey all kind of sound like they come from the same person. I don't know if\n\nit's a secretary out there who's doing it or what.\n\nGROSS: That's the secret.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: The scripts are very weird, you know?\n\nGROSS: You must be able to read screenplays with confidence because you write\n\nplays. I mean, I know, like for me, for instance, it's very hard for me to\n\nread a play or a screenplay and really be able to kind of stage in my mind how\n\nit would look and sound together.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: Well, screenplays are easier to read because if you can't get\n\npast the first five pages, you might as well throw it in the fire, you know?\n\nThat's it. Five pages.\n\nGROSS: Well, I really want to thank you a lot for talking with us about your\n\nlife and your work. Appreciate it very much.\n\nMr. SHEPARD: OK. You bet.\n\nBIANCULLI: Playwright, actor and director Sam Shepard. His new collection of\n\nshort stories is called \"Great Dream of Heaven.\" Coming up, a review of the\n\nnew film \"About Schmidt.\" This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Jack Nicholson film \"About Schmidt\"\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, host:\n\nJack Nicholson stars in the new movie \"About Schmidt,\" loosely based on a\n\nnovel by Louis Begley. It's directed by Alexander Payne and written by Jim\n\nTaylor. The two also collaborated on the films \"Citizen Ruth\" and \"Election.\"\n\nFilm critic John Powers says it's been years since he's seen Jack Nicholson\n\nthis good.\n\nJOHN POWERS reporting:\n\nWhenever Hollywood makes a comedy about the so-called flyover states, I\n\nusually wind up cringing. These movies nearly always turn locals into quaint\n\nor disdainful cartoons, rather like the Southerners in the hit movie \"Sweet\n\nHome Alabama.\" That's one reason I'm so fond of Alexander Payne's \"About\n\nSchmidt,\" my favorite American movie this year. Although it isn't shy about\n\nmocking the foibles of ordinary Midwesterners, this heartbreaking new film has\n\nthe emotional richness you found in the great Italian and Eastern European\n\ncomedies of the 1960s, in which comedy and tragedy walked arm in arm.\n\nJack Nicholson stars in what must surely be the least Nicholsonian role of his\n\ncareer. He's Warren Schmidt, an Omaha actuary whose wife Helen dies shortly\n\nafter his retirement. After briefly falling apart, Schmidt clamors into his\n\nhuge Winnebago Adventurer and hits the road in search of something. He visits\n\nhis childhood home and his old college frat house and finally heads to Denver\n\nfor the wedding of his disaffected daughter Jeannie. That's the actress, Hope\n\nDavis. Jeannie's marrying a dim bulb waterbed salesman named Randall, played\n\nby Dermot Mulroney, who sports a genuinely terrifying mullet.\n\nOnce in Denver, Schmidt meets Randall's quasi-hippie-ish clan, headed by\n\nhis loud, gregarious mother Roberta, who's exuberantly played by Kathy Bates.\n\nSchmidt would like to stop what he sees is a misguided marriage, but he\n\ndoesn't want to further alienate Jeannie, whose irritation with him is\n\napparent when they discuss her mother's funeral back in Omaha.\n\n(Soundbite from \"About Schmidt\")\n\nMs. HOPE DAVIS (\"Jeannie\"): Dad?\n\nMr. JACK NICHOLSON (\"Warren Schmidt\"): Hmm?\n\nMs. DAVIS: Why did you get such a cheap casket?\n\nMr. NICHOLSON: What?\n\nMs. DAVIS: I could tell you got the cheapest casket. Everybody could.\n\nMr. NICHOLSON: Oh, that is not true. That is not true. I specifically did\n\nnot choose, as you say, the cheapest casket. There was one less expensive\n\nwhich they showed me and I refused it.\n\nMs. DAVIS: You mean a pine box?\n\nMr. NICHOLSON: Well, I don't remember what it was.\n\nMs. DAVIS: She waited on you hand and foot. Couldn't you have splurged on\n\nher just once? Once?\n\nMr. NICHOLSON: Hey, hey, hey! What are you talking about? What about the\n\nWinnebago out there? What do you call that? That's an expensive vehicle. I\n\ndidn't want to get it, but I did. That was completely your mother's idea.\n\nMs. DAVIS: She told me she had to pay for, like, half of it. She said she\n\nhad to sell some of her stock or something to pay for it.\n\nMr. NICHOLSON: Well, that was her decision. I was willing to go as far as\n\nthe Mini-Wini, but no, she had to have the Adventurer. She wanted the whole\n\nshebang. What was I supposed to do, tell her she couldn't? It was her money.\n\nNo, no, no. You can't call me to task on that one. Hmm-mm.\n\nPOWERS: The film's director, Alexander Payne, was born in Omaha, and all\n\nthree of his films have been set there. He's the cornhusker cineast laureate.\n\nAs one who came of age in that same city, I can attest to Payne's uncannily\n\naccurate feel for the place--the drabness of the light, the deceptive visual\n\nblandness of its neighborhoods and the constant workings of social class. Be\n\nit the ambition of poor girl Tracy Flick in the great comedy \"Election\" or the\n\nstolidly middle-class Schmidt being horrified that Randall's declasse family\n\nwould hold a wedding rehearsal dinner at Tony Roma's and frame Randall's\n\ndiploma for passing a two-week course in electronics.\n\nPayne and his screenwriting partner Jim Taylor have a marvelous eye for social\n\ncomedy, and \"About Schmidt\" is bursting with terrific gags about Hummel\n\nfigurines, toilet etiquette in a Winnebago, and the surprises of middle-aged\n\nrandiness. Still, there's a profoundly bleak undercurrent to Schmidt's story,\n\nespecially in the letters he writes to a six-year-old Tanzanian foster child\n\nhe began supporting after seeing a TV commercial. Each time Schmidt begins\n\nreading `Dear Ndugo,' the audience cracks up, not only because these words\n\nsound intrinsically funny but because they promise revelation. Schmidt\n\nactually shows more of his bottled-up anger, fear and loneliness to the\n\nAfrican child than he does to anyone he really knows.\n\nThe movie's core of melancholy is beautifully conveyed by Jack Nicholson, who\n\ngives what's easily his best performance in at least two decades. It's always\n\nbeen part of Nicholson's vanity that he's not vain like Warren Beatty or\n\nRobert Redford. He's willing to appear fat, flat faced and ordinary. Here he\n\ngives Schmidt the staring detachment found in so many fathers of that\n\ngeneration, including my own. His gaze is at once observant, judgmental and\n\nslightly perplexed, as if he's looking for a transcendence so inevitable that\n\nhe himself isn't really sure he's looking for it.\n\nWhile on the road, Schmidt stops at a museum dedicated to the pioneers and\n\nfeels that compared to the courage of these men and women with their covered\n\nwagons, he's nothing, a coward. But, in fact, this retired insurance man is a\n\nkind of modern pioneer whose mini odyssey in his Winnebago bespeaks a quiet\n\nheroism of its own. All alone, Schmidt is confronting the most daunting of\n\nquestions: How do we invest life with some sense of purpose? What keeps us\n\ngoing in the shadow of death?\n\n\"About Schmidt\" offers one answer in the exquisitely ironic final scene in\n\nwhich everything comes together--the journey, the search for meaning, even the\n\nletters to Ndugo. Payne builds the whole movie to a final close-up, a moment\n\nof surpassing emotional brilliance by Nicholson. It makes us feel the\n\nwrenching solitude of Schmidt's life, yet offers an unexpected glimpse of\n\nhope, a brief intimation that there's more to his life than just himself. And\n\nin this brief moment of release, we are meant to understand that this movie\n\nisn't only about Schmidt.\n\nBIANCULLI: John Powers is film critic and columnist for LA Weekly.\n\n(Credits)"
