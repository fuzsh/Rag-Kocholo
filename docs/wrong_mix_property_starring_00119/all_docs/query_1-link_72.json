        "text": "The Broadway première of Sam Shepard’s acclaimed 1980 play, “True West,” in 2000, was astonishing for several reasons. For one, by 2000, Shepard—who had brought his cowboy swagger, muscular language, and rock-and-roll rhythms to New York’s downtown theatre scene in the sixties and seventies—was a prolific, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and a prolific, Oscar-nominated film actor. Yet the anguished, funny “True West,” which the actor Ethan Hawke recently called Shepard’s “card-carrying audience-pleaser,” had never been staged on Broadway. Then, there were the production’s virtuosic performances. Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly alternated in the roles of Austin, a screenwriter, and Lee, his ne’er-do-well brother—a device that could have felt like a gimmick but, instead, enriched the play’s exploration of duality. (A 1982 revival, at the Steppenwolf, in Chicago, starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich, is also legendary.)\n\nIn the course of “True West,” the brothers display humor, vulnerability, and savagery; they also essentially destroy each other and their mother’s house. It is, in other words, a showcase for male actors in their prime. A new revival (a Roundabout Theatre Company production, at the American Airlines)—“True West” ’s first Broadway revival, and the first Broadway staging of a Shepard play since his death, in 2017—offers a showcase to Ethan Hawke and Paul Dano. The production was under way before Shepard’s death; he had enlisted the British director James Macdonald, and Hawke had been contacted about co-starring. Hawke had had a powerful connection to the play ever since he first watched a film of the 1982 Steppenwolf production, when he was fourteen. “Not to be corny, but it was truly a revelatory moment,” he has said. “I just couldn’t sleep all night. I said, ‘That’s what I want to do with my life.’ ”\n\nAlthough he has performed in several Shepard plays since then, and directed a well-received production of “A Lie of the Mind,” Off Broadway, in 2010, this is his first foray into “True West.” The timing feels right. After three decades of movie stardom and artistic efforts ranging from cringe-inducing to brilliant, Hawke, now forty-eight, has been liberated by maturity and a weathering of his appearance. His creased brow lends him a new versatility that opens him up—he can play a regular guy, or a handsome one, or a dirtbag. His performance last year, as a tormented minister, in Paul Schrader’s film “First Reformed” is among the best of his career. Here, he wears the role of Lee like a second skin, stepping into the work that helped define him.\n\nShepard warned that grafting a “stylistic ‘concept’ ” onto the set design of “True West” would serve only to confuse his characters’ evolution. Macdonald and his set designer, Mimi Lien, have followed the script’s exacting instructions but have also played with them a little. Before each scene, a lighted border glows around the proscenium arch, like a snazzy picture frame or a hint of Hollywood. The stage space has been raised and made shallower, as if flat-screened. This doesn’t confuse anything: being continually reminded of the artifice of performance helps us forgive the play’s occasional staginess. As the lights come up, Austin (Dano) is hunched over a notebook at a kitchen table. He’s house-sitting for his mother, in suburban Southern California, caring for her plants and trying to write. This could be your grandmother’s kitchen. Cherry-print wallpaper, sunny yellows, lush houseplants, decorations approaching kitsch without succumbing to it—everything conveys haimish order and care. There’s love in this room, and it’s about to get torn apart.\n\nLee has shown up after three months in the desert; he’s drinking beer and making aimless conversation. “You always work by candlelight?” he asks. “Isn’t that what the old guys did?” Austin is trying to concentrate; he’s got a meeting with a producer the next day. “What old guys?” he says. “The Forefathers,” Lee says. “You know.” Hawke, in a scuzzy trenchcoat, looking convincingly greasy, enjoys himself, at times nearly singing his lines, waving his hands in teasing disdain. But he doesn’t overdo it. He indicates the insecurities behind Lee’s aggression, and not only when Lee is grousing about Austin’s “art” and his Ivy League education. Austin says that he’s writing a screenplay pitch for a “period piece,” a love story; Lee says that he’s made art, too, then talks about robbing local houses and, later, dogfighting.\n\nLike much of Shepard’s work, “True West” was inspired in part by Shepard’s father, Sam Rogers, a violent alcoholic. Like Austin and Lee’s father, Rogers spent years living in the desert; he died after being hit by a car outside a bar. In “True West,” the father’s drunken chaos infects everything. (Austin talks about his father having his teeth pulled in Juárez, then losing his false teeth in a bag of chop suey.) That chaos is in Lee, too. He’s dismissive of Austin’s success. At the same time, he wants it for himself—along with the domestic pleasures he disrupts. “Just a sweet kinda’ suburban silence,” he says of one of the homes he cases. “Kinda’ place that sorta’ kills ya’ inside. Warm yellow lights. Mexican tile all around. . . . Blonde people movin’ in and outa’ the rooms, talkin’ to each other.”\n\nThroughout, the thirty-four-year-old Dano, who made his Broadway début at ten, beautifully evinces a character navigating a loved one’s difficult behavior. His Austin veers from engagement to improvisation to damage control—trying to retain power over his pitch meeting, or his car keys—without causing offense. When Lee, carrying a stolen TV, walks into Austin’s meeting with Saul, the producer (Gary Wilmes, wonderfully smarmy here, with a hint of mid-career Jerry Orbach), Dano doesn’t act embarrassed. He does make a delightful hand gesture—downward-moving, palms flat—that’s somewhere between Well, Saul, wasn’t this fun? and Lee, take it down a notch. (It doesn’t work.) Dano is a thoughtful actor, who often embodies a kind of startled innocence; when he shows brutality, as he does in Act II of “True West,” it can be thrilling.\n\nLee charms his way into a golf game with Saul, and from there into talk of a “true-to-life Western,” and from there, improbably, into a movie deal. The plot whirls along, heading inevitably toward collaborative writing, drunken mayhem, brandished golf clubs, existential crises, flying toast. Questions about authenticity agonize them. Austin calls Lee’s movie idea “bullshit”—“two lamebrains chasing each other across Texas,” as “phony as Hopalong Cassidy.” The ensuing merging and transfiguring of identities—and blotto writer’s-block rage—culminates in shock, but to a contemporary audience the lead-up can feel like squalor for squalor’s sake: since 1980, we’ve seen countless semi-romanticized depictions of conflicted American men spiralling into oblivion. The misery is leavened by the return of the men’s mother (an appealing Marylouise Burke); Hawke plays Lee’s reaction to her with quiet, abashed politeness, shrinking into himself.\n\nWhen Saul says, of Austin’s screenplay pitch, “Nobody’s interested in love these days,” he could almost be speaking for “True West,” which is as laconic about Austin’s love-story idea as it is about his wife and kids. We hear nothing about them but a great deal about fathers, competition, and male angst—the two “lamebrains” pursuing each other through the Texas Panhandle and the ones rolling around on the kitchen floor. The thought of desert life, like thoughts of their father, exerts a haunting pull on the brothers, out of desperation (for Lee) or a kind of desperate fantasy (for Austin). “There’s nothin’ real down here, Lee!” Austin says. “Least of all me!” That desolate landscape is more vivid to them than the domestic calm of the kitchen they destroy, or of Austin’s life back home.\n\nA few years ago, Hawke tried to direct a version of “True West” starring Marin Ireland and Martha Plimpton. He wanted to “expose how the female psychology is just as vulnerable” to warring duality. Shepard “was utterly baffled by the suggestion.” Hawke explained, “He’s from a different tree in the forest—an older part of the forest.” Shepard’s writing and his vision are as powerful as ever, but American masculinity has evolved since he wrote “True West”; what’s true for one generation may not be true for the next. ♦"
