        "text": "The Notebook (film) General Information Premiered\n\nMay 20, 2004 (SIFF)\n\nJune 25, 2004\n\nStarring\n\nRyan Gosling as Noah Calhoun\n\nRachel McAdams as Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton\n\nBudget\n\n$29 million\n\nBox Office\n\n$115,603,229\n\nThe Notebook is a 2004 American romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940's. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man (portrayed by James Garner) telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident (played by Gena Rowlands, who is Cassavetes' mother).\n\nThe Notebook received mixed reviews but performed well at the box office and received several award nominations, winning eight Teen Choice Awards, a Satellite Award and an MTV Movie Award. The film became a sleeper hit and has gained a cult following. On November 11, 2012, ABC Family premiered an extended version with deleted scenes added back into the original storyline.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAt a modern-day nursing home, an elderly man named Duke begins to read a romantic story from his notebook to a fellow patient.\n\nThe story he tells begins in the 1940's, in Seabrook Island, South Carolina. Local country boy Noah Calhoun is smitten with seventeen-year-old heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) after seeing her at a carnival, and they share an idyllic summer love affair. Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house, explaining that he intends to buy it for them. Later that evening, she asks him to make love to her, but they are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin with the news that Allie's parents have the police out looking for her.\n\nWhen Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, they ban her from seeing Noah. In a heated argument, Allie's mother calls Noah \"trash, trash, trash\" and Noah overhears. Upset, he walks out and Allie chases after him. The ensuing argument between the two ends in a break up and the next morning, Allie's mother, Ann (Joan Allen) announces that the family is returning home to Charleston. Allie attempts to contact Noah, but is unable to find him. She asks Fin to tell Noah that she loves him before driving home. When Noah gets Allie's message he rushes over to the family's house only to find it empty.\n\nNoah and Allie have no choice but to move on with their lives. Noah writes to Allie every day for a year, but never receives a response. Heartbroken, Noah enlists with Fin to fight in World War II. Fin is killed in battle. However, it is later revealed that he faked his death and become Lon because he was secretly in love with Allie. Meanwhile, Allie volunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets an officer named Lon Hammond, Jr. (James Marsden), a young lawyer who is handsome, sophisticated, charming and comes from old Southern money. The two eventually become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents, but Allie sees Noah's face when Lon asks her to marry him.\n\nWhen Noah returns home from the war, he discovers his father has sold their home so that Noah can buy the abandoned house, fulfilling his lifelong dream to buy it for Allie, whom he has neither seen nor heard from for several years. While visiting Charleston, Noah witnesses Allie and Lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will come back to him. Later, Allie is startled to read in the newspaper that Noah has completed the house to the specifications she'd made years prior, and she visits him in Seabrook.\n\nIn the present, it is revealed that the elderly woman is Allie, who is suffering from dementia. Duke is her husband, but Allie does not recognize him, nor remember any of the events Duke is reading to her.\n\nBack in the forties, Allie returns to Seabrook to find Noah living in the restored house. The two renew their relationship and make love. In the morning, Ann appears on Noah's doorstep, warning Allie that Lon has followed her to Seabrook. She gives Allie the letters that Noah had written to her, admitting that she had hidden them from Allie. Ann reveals that in her youth she, too, had been in love with a lower class young man and that she still thinks of him. Allie confesses to Lon that she has been spending time with Noah. He is upset but says that he still loves her. Allie tells him she knows she should be with him, but she remains indecisive.\n\nIn the present, Allie briefly becomes lucid. She remembers that the story Duke is reading is the story of how they met. Duke tells her how she appeared at Noah's doorstep with her belongings, having left Lon at the hotel, and Allie suddenly remembers her past. At the onset of her dementia, she wrote their love story in the notebook with instructions for Noah to \"read this to me, and I'll come back to you.\" But Allie soon relapses, losing her memories of Noah. She panics, not understanding who he is, and has to be sedated. Duke - who is in fact Noah - is hospitalized with what seems to be a heart attack.\n\nWhen he is released from the hospital, Noah visits Allie and finds her lucid again. Allie asks Noah what will happen to them when she loses her memory completely, and he reassures her that he will never leave her. She asks him if he thinks their love for each other is strong enough to \"take them away together\"; he replies that he thinks their love can do anything. After each tells the other that they love them, they both go to sleep in Allie's bed. The next morning a nurse finds that they have died peacefully in bed together.\n\nCast[]\n\nRyan Gosling as Noah Calhoun\n\nJames Garner as Old Noah Calhoun / \"Duke\"\n\nRachel McAdams as Allison Hamilton\n\nGena Rowlands as Old Allie Calhoun (n√©e Hamilton)\n\nJoan Allen as Ann Hamilton\n\nJames Marsden as Lon Hammond, Jr.\n\nJamie Brown as Martha Shaw\n\nSam Shepard as Frank Calhoun\n\nDavid Thornton as John Hamilton\n\nKevin Connolly as Fin\n\nHeather Wahlquist as Sara Tuffington\n\nEd Grady as Harry\n\nObba Babatunde as Bandleader\n\nMark Johnson as Photographer\n\nStarletta DuPois as Nurse Esther\n\nWilliam Sattelberg as Ryan Gosling's stunt double\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe film rights to Nicholas Sparks's novel were acquired by New Line Cinema in 1996, represented by producer Mark Johnson. Jeremy Leven was hired to write the script, which caught the attention of director Steven Spielberg in 1998, who wished to film it with Tom Cruise as Noah Calhoun. Spielberg's commitment to other projects led to Jim Sheridan becoming attached to direct the following year. Filming was to start in 1999 but pushed back over rewrites. Sheridian eventually backed out by October 2000 to work on In America. Martin Campbell entered negotiations to direct in March 2001, before he was replaced by Nick Cassavetes a year later.\n\nCasting[]\n\nCassavetes wanted someone unknown and \"not handsome\" to portray Noah; therefore, he cast Ryan Gosling in the role. Gosling was initially surprised by this: \"I read [the script] and I thought, 'He's crazy. I couldn't be more wrong for this movie.' \" \"It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time - from 1940 to 1946 - that was quite profound and formative.\" To prepare for the part, Gosling temporarily moved to Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming. During two months, he rowed the Ashley River and made furniture. A nationwide search was conducted to find the right actress to play Allie. Actresses who auditioned for the role included Jessica Biel, Britney Spears, Ashley Judd and Reese Witherspoon, and Rachel McAdams was ultimately chosen. On casting her, Cassavetes said: \"When Rachel McAdams came in and read, it was apparent that she was the one. She and Ryan had great chemistry between them.\" She commented: \"I thought it would be a dream to be able to do it. I read the script and went into the audition just two days later. It was a good way to do it, because I was very full of the story.\" Gosling commented that, \"I think that it's pretty fair to say that we probably wouldn't have made the film if we hadn't found Rachel...Really, Allie drives the movie. It's her movie and we're in it. It all kind of depended on an actress.\" In comparison to the book, the role was extended. McAdams spent time in Charleston before filming to familiarize herself with the surroundings, and took ballet and etiquette classes. She had a dialect coach to learn the southern accent.\n\nFilming[]\n\nThe Notebook was filmed almost entirely on location in South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Production offices for the film were set up at the old Charleston Naval Base in North Charleston.\n\nMuch of the film's plot takes place in and around Seabrook Island, an actual town which is one of the South Carolina \"sea islands.\" It is located 20 miles southwest of Charleston, South Carolina. However, none of the filming took place in the Seabrook area. The house that Noah is seen fixing up is a private residence at Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina, which is another \"sea island\" locality situated 10 miles closer to Charleston. The house was not actually in a dilapidated state at any time, but it was made to look that way by special effects in the first half of the film. Contrary to the suggestion in the film's dialogue, neither the house nor the Seabrook area was home to South Carolina Revolutionary hero Francis Marion, whose plantation was actually located some distance northwest of Charleston. The Boone Hall Plantation served as Allie's summer house.\n\nMany of the scenes set in Seabrook were filmed in the town of Mt. Pleasant, (a suburb of Charleston). Others were filmed in Charleston and in Edisto Island. The lake scenes were filmed at Cypress Gardens (in Moncks Corner, South Carolina) with trained birds that were brought in from elsewhere.\n\nThe nursing home scenes were filmed at Rice Hope Plantation, located in Georgetown County, South Carolina. The college depicted briefly in the film is identified in the film as Sarah Lawrence College, but the campus that is seen is actually the College of Charleston.\n\nRelease[]\n\nBox-office performance[]\n\nThe film premiered June 25, 2004, in the United States and Canada and grossed $13.5 million in 2,303 theaters its opening weekend, ranking number 4 at the box office. The film grossed a total of $115.6 million worldwide, $81 million in Canada and the United States and $34.6 million in other countries. It is the 14th highest-grossing romantic drama film of all time.\n\nCritical response=[]\n\nThe performances of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, as well as their on-screen chemistry, were particularly praised by most film critics.\n\nThe Notebook received a mixed reaction from film critics. Based on 154 reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.7/10. At Metacritic, which assigns an average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film currently holds an average score of 53, based on 34 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film, awarding it with three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the photography \"striking in its rich, saturated effects\" and stating that the \"actors are blessed by good material.\" Peter Lowry of Film Threat gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five; praising the performances of both Gosling and McAdams, he wrote: \"Gosling and especially McAdams give all-star performances, doing just enough to hand the reins over to the pros, who take what's left of the film and finish the audience off with some touching scenes that don't leave a dry eye in the house.\" About the film itself, he added: \"Overall, The Notebook is a surprisingly good film that manages to succeed where many other \"chick flick\" like romances fail.\"\n\nStephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating that \"the scenes between the young lovers confronting adult authority have the same seething tension and lurking hysteria that the young Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood brought more than 40 years ago to their roles in Splendor in the Grass.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post also gave the film a positive review, she also praised the performances of Gosling and McAdams, stating: \"Never mind that McAdams and Gosling don't for a minute call to mind 1940s America; they're both suitably attractive and appealing. Gosling, who delivered a searing and largely unseen screen debut performance in the 2001 drama The Believer, is particularly convincing as a young man who charms his way past a girl's strongest defenses.\" About the film, she added: \"Audiences craving big, gooey over-the-top romance have their must-see summer movie in The Notebook.\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised the performance of McAdams but criticized the performance of Gosling, stating that he \"just doesn't have the kind of star power or chemistry with McAdams to anchor this kind of minor-league Gone with the Wind.\" He also added about the film that it \"doesn't completely work on its own terms, mainly because its romantic casting just doesn't spark: It doesn't make us fall in love with its lovers.\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars, praising the performances of its cast members, writing about McAdams that \"she's soulfully committed to the suds in the story and fiercely attentive to the other actors\". He added about Gosling: \"Gosling is adept at playing sociopaths and intense brooders, and there's reason to think, early on, that Noah might be similarly off, as when he threatens to drop from a Ferris wheel unless Allie agrees to go on a date with him.\" About the film, he wrote: \"Considering the sunny, relatively pleasurable romantic business that precedes it, the elderly stuff seems dark, morbid, and forced upon us.\"\n\nJessica Winter of The Village Voice gave the film a mixed review, stating: \"Amid the sticky-sweet swamp of Jeremy Leven's script, Rowlands and Garner emerge spotless and beatific, lending a magnanimous credibility to their scenes together. These two old pros slice cleanly through the thicket of sap-weeping dialogue and contrivance, locating the terror and desolation wrought by the cruel betrayals of a failing mind.\" Robert Koehler of Variety magazine also gave the film a mixed review, he however, praised the performances, writing that \"already one of the most intriguing young thesps, Gosling extends his range to pure romance without sacrificing a bit of his naturally subversive qualities, and even seems comfortable looking beautiful in a manly American way. The head-turner is McAdams, doing such a different perf from her top bitch in Mean Girls that it's hard to tell it's the same actor. She skillfully carries much of the film's emotional weight with a free and easy manner.\"\n\nIn June 2010, Entertainment Weekly included Allie and Noah in its list of the \"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.\" The periodical listed The Notebook in their 25 Sexiest Movies Ever. Us Weekly included the film in their list of the 30 Most Romantic Movies of All Time. Boston.com ranked the film the third Top Romantic Movie.
