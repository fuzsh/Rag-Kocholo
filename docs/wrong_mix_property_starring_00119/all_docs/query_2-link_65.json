The 60 something actor from The Right Stuff is poised to play just that, a 60 something actor.\n\nThe film tells the story of grizzled actor in the John Wayne mode who has an epiphany one day in the middle of a shoot. The man rides off to go on a voyage of self-discovery, leaving behind a confused production crew.\n\nMs. North by Northwest herself, Eva Marie Saint, will make a rare acting appearance as the mother of Shepard's character. Sarah Polley, Tim Roth and Jessica Lange also co-star. The film is being directed by obfuscating auteur Wim Wenders. (David Mumpower/BOP)"
