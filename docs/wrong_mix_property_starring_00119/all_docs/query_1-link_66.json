        "text": "Now that “Dexter” is over for Michael C. Hall, he’s busy getting into films. His next one is an indie called “Cold in July.” Based on a novel by Joe R. Landsale, “Cold In July” is sort of a “Cape Fear.” Hall plays a family man who shoots an intruder in his home. Then the dead intruder’s ex con father shows up. Sources say that playwright and popular actor Sam Shepard has signed on for the role of Ben Russell. Jim Mickle is directing from his own script with Nick Damici…NO word yet on who will play Hall’s wife…\n\n…Stephen Dorff is in New York to film “Oliver’s Deal” for producer Christine Vachon and first time director Barney Elliot. His co-stars are Alberto Ammann and Carlos Bardem, older brother of Oscar winner Javier and brother in law of Penelope Cruz. The movie shoots briefly in New York before heading for Peru and Macchu Picchu. Carlos has a long resume in Spanish film and is also a well known poet. He was also in a 2011 movie called “Americano” which we all missed but maybe should review: Salma Hayek plays a very convincing stripper named Lola.\n\nDorff, by the way, just had a bunch of celeb friends up to his house in Malibu, I’m told, for a marathon viewing of “Breaking Bad.” They took in eight episodes in a row…Now, that’s binge viewing!…"
