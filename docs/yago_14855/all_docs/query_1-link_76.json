        "text": "MINNIE DRIVER is equally at home telling an off-color joke or spelling Aeschylus correctly on a crossword puzzle, as she did recently in a rare moment of repose at a midtown Manhattan hotel. The 27-year-old British actress, who has made a career for herself in the United States in hit movies like ''Big Night,'' ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' and ''Good Will Hunting,'' displays a dizzying array of attributes: she's intellectual and earthy, statuesque and spirited. Perched on a chair with her legs tucked under her, she looks very much the rising star, with high-heeled lizard-print sandals on her feet and with her unruly ringlets pinned up in a smooth twist. But her frank personality penetrates any pose, whether it be through her irrepressible laugh, which invites complicity, or her sudden seriousness when she talks about the professional and personal tumult of the last few months.\n\nMs. Driver's new film, ''The Governess,'' opened on Friday, but she is still best known these days as Skylar, the Harvard undergraduate from Britain who falls in love with the unlikely math genius played by Matt Damon in ''Good Will Hunting.'' That performance gained her a nomination for the best-supporting-actress Oscar this year.\n\nSince her Academy Award nomination, Ms. Driver's profile has grown beyond that of simply a supporting actress -- partly because of the roles coming her way, partly because her off-screen relationship with Mr. Damon, and its breakup, made her a popular subject among gossip columnists. ''Minnie has the potential to be both a character actress and a leading lady,'' said Barry Levinson, who directed her in the 1996 film ''Sleepers.'' ''She is very attractive, but she is also very chameleonlike.''\n\nIn any case, Ms. Driver certainly has a knack for choosing roles in films that will be successful. How does she pick them? ''I know my emotional repertory well,'' she replied in her gravelly voice, ''and when I read something that has a resonance in that part of me, I listen. I've never felt that I had to take a role in one of those mediocre but hugely budgeted romantic comedies because I want to wear beautiful dresses and have people think I'm pretty and that I get the guy. I really believe in the characters I play.''\n\n''The Governess'' is a departure for Ms. Driver in that it is a period drama, a British film (her first in several years) and, most important, her largest role since 1995, when she made her feature-film debut in ''Circle of Friends.'' In the new movie, she plays Rosina Da Silva, a young Jewish woman in 1840 in London whose businessman father is suddenly murdered. Needing to find a way to support her mother and sister, Rosina hits on the idea of becoming a governess -- though to find work she must hide the fact that she is Jewish. Hired by a wealthy family in Scotland, she falls into a passionate affair with the man of the house, Charles Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson), who is a pioneering photographer.\n\nMs. Driver was attracted to the movie, which was filmed last summer in England and Scotland, because she felt it avoided the cliches of British costume drama. ''I wanted to do a period drama, but I didn't want it to be chocolate-boxy,'' she said. ''And sure enough, along came this twisted tale of spiritual subterfuge and blind eroticism.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
