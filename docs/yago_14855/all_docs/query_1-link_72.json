        "text": "List of Competitors\n\nROME — Venice Intl. Film Festival chief Alberto Barbera has assembled an eclectic mix of international titles, new work from established arthouse auteurs, and esoteric fare from little-known filmmakers for the newly restructured 58th annual festival, running Aug. 29-Sept. 8.\n\nWhile the hefty profile enjoyed by studio fare in Venice during much of the 1990s seems a thing of the past, the U.S. majors are well represented, primarily out of competition.\n\nWarners is present with Steven Spielberg’s “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” David Mamet’s “Heist” and Antoine Fuqua’s “Training Day”; Fox will be on hand with Albert and Allen Hughes’ “From Hell”; Columbia weighs in with “John Carpenter’s Ghosts of Mars”; and perennial Venice favorite Woody Allen returns with “The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,” which DreamWorks has in the U.S.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIndie productions from the U.S. selected for competition include Larry Clark’s “Bully,” Richard Linklater’s “Waking Life” and Jill Sprecher’s “13 Conversations About One Thing.”\n\nAlso competing is Cruise/Wagner’s Spanish/U.S. production “The Others,” directed by Alejandro Amenabar and starring Nicole Kidman, which goes out through Miramax in the U.S.\n\nBrits back\n\nAfter being entirely absent from this year’s Cannes fest selection, Brit productions will make a small comeback at Venice, with Miramax’s long-stalled “Birthday Girl,” directed by Jez Butterworth and also starring Kidman, premiering out of competition alongside “Lucky Break,” Peter Cattaneo’s first feature since “The Full Monty.”\n\nCompetition selections from the U.K. include Ken Loach’s drama of South Yorkshire railway workers, “The Navigators”; Sandra Goldbacher’s story of the friendship between two girls over three decades, “Me Without You”; and German-U.K. co-production “Invincible,” Werner Herzog’s retelling of the true story of a Jewish fairground strongman.\n\nThe festival opens with the British-Italian-German-Macedonian co-production “Dust,” a Balkan Western starring Joseph Fiennes and David Wenham.\n\nDirector Milcho Manchevski returns out of competition to Venice after taking the Golden Lion in 1994 for his debut feature, “Before the Rain.”\n\nLeaner look\n\nAs previously announced, the overhauled event has been considerably streamlined, with the main competition split in two to focus attention more evenly throughout the program.\n\nClassical narratives and consolidated filmmaking styles have been slotted into the principal Venezia 58 competition, while more risky fare screens in the cutting-edge Cinema of the Present section, each judged by a separate jury.\n\nBut on paper at least, the boundaries between the two competitions appear blurred, with both established names and newcomers figuring in each lineup.\n\n“This year we’ve attempted to find an equilibrium between widely talked-about and anticipated films and lesser-known titles that can provide a few surprises,” says fest director Alberto Barbera.\n\n“Our aim was to expand the festival’s gaze as widely as possible to avoid being merely a preview forum for films already destined for commercial exposure, and instead to function as a laboratory for the exploration of new filmmaking terrain.”\n\nStars expected to attend the festival include Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment for “A.I.,” Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron for “Jade Scorpion,” Denzel Washington for “Training Day,” Johnny Depp for “From Hell,” Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito for “Heist,” Joseph Fiennes for “Dust,” Mira Sorvino and Ben Kingsley for Clare Peploe’s period piece “The Triumph of Love,” Tim Roth for “Invincible” and Samantha Morton for “Eden.”\n\nPrincipal section lineups follow:\n\n58th Venice Intl.
