        "text": "Focus on females: Other films celebrating female friendship\n\nNot in the mood for getting \"Carrie-d\" away? Try this smattering of features about the bond between women. Since mainstream film has women as girlfriends and daughters, if looking for female-centric films, remember the ever-fertile categories of indies (The Clockwatchers, Gas Food Lodging), teen movies (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants), foreign (Mina Tannenbaum), and Joan Crawford classics (The Women). Nine To Five\n\nFeature, Dir. Colin Higgins, 1980\n\nLily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda stick it to their boss, warble a classic song. The best. Fried Green Tomatoes\n\nFeature, Dir. Jon Avnet, 1991\n\nFamously about female friendship, since the book's central lesbian relationship was cut and merely implied in a food fight. Still a pretty good movie with the ever-rad Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates as pals.Thelma and Louise\n\nFeature, Dir. Ridley Scott, 1991\n\nWhile it may be remembered for introducing the world to a shirtless, gorgeous Brad Pitt, Thelma and Louise had the world by the throat as they ran off on their empowering road trip. The Time-cover zeitgeist of the early 90s. Walking and Talking\n\nFeature, Dir. Nicole Holofcener, 1996\n\nPossibly one of the most accurate films ever made about a best-friendship unmoored when one friend announces her engagement. For those nights when you want to tell your best friend all your secrets without her s.o. automatically knowing them too. Me Without You\n\nFeature, Dir. Sandra Goldbacher, 2001\n\nA British movie about the dynamic between the \"pretty\" one (Anna Friel) and the \"smart\" (Michelle Williams) one. Painful and real."
