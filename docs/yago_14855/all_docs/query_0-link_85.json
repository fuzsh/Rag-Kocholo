        "text": "In celebration of International Women’s Day, the BFI are launching an exciting series that sees females across the film industry including Natalie Dormer, Ruth Wilson, Lydia West and Susan Wokomo discuss their favourite films directed by women. Each has chosen a favourite from the BFI’s extensive 60-strong female-directed feature film library – part of BFI Player’s new Women With a Movie Camera collection – and reveals why they passionately feel their choice is an essential watch; how it has influenced them, their lives and their careers.\n\nThe series begins on International Women’s Day (8th March) with Natalie Dormer’s introduction to Me Without You, starring Anna Friel and Michelle Williams. Watch the clip below for a preview of Dorman’s contribution, in which the actress reflects on how the film explores female friendship and identity.\n\nIn her introduction, Dormer explains how the film speaks to her personally: “It does a thoughtful job of portraying the intensity and the potent dynamics that bind young women. Emotionally I think the film has a tremendous authenticity and realism to it, especially in the detail. There were a couple of times when I was cringing and had to almost turn from the screen because it was so accurately reminiscent of some of my own long-past experiences”.\n\nShe also talks about her own conversations with the director herself: “We (Sandra Goldbacher and I) had a great chat about the intensity of those early years, those early formative female friendships, and how you can almost get stuck with that weird co-dependency to the detriment to romantic relationships and as this film so eloquently handles to the detriment of your inner self and growing of identity. The film handles the guilt of trying to pull free from that very effectively, so it’s a great emotional narrative piece ”\n\nA Q&A with Me Without You director Sandra Goldbacher will also be launching on 8th March to mark the film’s 20th anniversary.\n\nThe following introductions have also been confirmed to be released over the course of the series, with more to be announced in due course:\n\nActress Ruth Wilson introduces Céline Sciamma’s Tomboy\n\nSusan Wokoma introduces Prevenge, directed by and starring Alice Lowe\n\nLydia West, recently seen in the acclaimed It’s a Sin, picks Debbie Tucker Green’s\n\nSecond Coming\n\nPerfect 10 director Eva Riley introduces Carine Adler’s Under the Skin\n\nZeina Durra, who has recently directed Luxor, picks Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless\n\nWoman\n\nFilm writer Hanna Flint introduces Clio Barnard’s The Arbour\n\nFilm writer Hannah Woodhead selects Andrea Arnold’s Red Road\n\nThe series has been collated to promote the BFI’s brand-new Women with a Movie Camera collection, now available on BFI Player. The filmography comprises almost 60 inspirational and diverse features made by women from around the world, all focusing on women’s experiences. Highlights from the collection include Jessica Hausner’s cool, witty sci-fi Little Joe, starring Emily Beecham and Ben Whishaw; Appropriate Behaviour, a fearless comedy following the misadventures of a bisexual Brooklynite, directed by and starring Desiree Akhavan; Joanna Hogg’s Unrelated, in which a forty-something woman finds herself drawn to the company of a group of partying teens, including a young Tom Hiddleston; and the Idris Elba-led family drama Second Coming, directed by Debbie Tucker Green. Audiences can enjoy expertly curated recommendations from these fabulous female industry figures offering a first foray into the expansive collection. Introductions will be rolled out every two weeks.\n\nThe editorial unit"
