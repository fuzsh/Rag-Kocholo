        "text": "An overlooked, nicely acerbic glimpse at a friendship from 1973 to 2001, Sandra Goldbacher's pacy, brisk, unpretentious film contradicts one of video renters' 10 commandments: never pick anything with Anna Friel in it. Not that there's anything wrong with Friel per se, but she has a habit of turning up in the worst films of the last few years (Mad Cow, Rogue Trader, you name it).\n\nHere she's very good as the stroppy, selfish, shallow half of an attachment by turns supportive and suffocating. Goldbacher handles the passage of time (1973 to 2001) well without hitting you over the head with nostalgic artefacts, and the relationship with Michelle Williams (with a credible English accent as Friel's dowdier friend) has realistically rough edges and credibly refuses to tie up loose ends as the duo progress from punk and heroin through a shared lover to marriage and middle age. The DVD has a commentary from Goldbacher."
