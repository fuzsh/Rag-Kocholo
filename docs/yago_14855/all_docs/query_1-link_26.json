Yeah, it was pretty basic, but it’s honestly shot pretty well and a lot of the acting is good, which is nice for an indie film like this. I love the scenes when Emma Watson is part of a play or acting in the movie (yes, she plays an actress). I think they are shot pretty well. I also just really enjoy watching movies set in the 19th and 20th centuries, I just like the feel of it, especially the music, which was great.…"
