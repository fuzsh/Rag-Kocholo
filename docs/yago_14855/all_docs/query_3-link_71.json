        "text": "Anna Friel and Michelle Williams star as two London girls, Marina (Friel) and Holly (Williams), who make a pledge of friendship during the early 1970s as they grow up on the Isle of Wight and in Brighton into the 1980s. But, as the years pass and their attentions turn to the opposite sex, their relationship is put to the test.\n\nCo-writer/ director Sandra Goldbacher’s 2001 film is a thoughtful, well made but drawn-out and uninspired drama, given a boost with persuasive acting from Friel and Williams. Anna Popplewell and Ella Jones play the young Marina and Holly.\n\nAlso in the cast are Oliver Milburn, Trudie Styler, Marianne Denicourt, Steve John Shepherd, Allan Corduner, Nicky Henson, Kyle MacLachlan, Cameron Powrie, Deborah Findlay, Hannah Bourne and Russell Mabey.\n\nIt is rated R for strong language, sexual content and drug use.\n\nIt is advertised as ‘From Sandra Goldbacher, writer/director of The Governess, comes a film about the agonies and ecstasies of friendship.’\n\nWilliams was commuting from the UK shoot back to the North Carolina to film TV’s Dawson’s Creek.\n\n© Derek Winnert 2017 Classic Movie Review 5315"
