        "text": "THE teenage girls in a grimy pub on the Isle of Man couldn't believe their eyes, recalled Sandra Goldbacher, the writer and director of the new film ''Me Without You.'' Their ''Dawson's Creek'' hero, Michelle Williams, appeared to be at the next table having a pint. But they weren't sure. Her trademark blond hair had been dyed a mousy brown. ''Is it really you?'' they asked. ''What are you doing 'ere?''\n\nThe girls were even more confounded when Ms. Williams assured them that it was indeed she, speaking in a letter-perfect British accent. She had, at least temporarily, shed the trappings of the tainted Jennifer Lindley of ''Dawson's Creek'' and taken on a persona much closer to her own for ''Me Without You,'' Ms. Goldbacher's semi-autobiographical story of an obsessive female friendship. (It opens on July 5.).\n\nUntil now, Ms. Williams has largely played young women who are working out questions about their sexuality. She has been a teenager with a crush on Richard Nixon in the film ''Dick'' (1999), a college student who has a steamy affair with another lesbian, played by ChloÃ« Sevigny, in the HBO movie ''If These Walls Could Talk 2'' (2000), and a disturbed girl who spends part of her time on stage naked in the 1999 Off Broadway play ''Killer Joe.''\n\n''I don't think of any of them as sexy, hot girls,'' Ms. Williams, 21, said in a telephone interview. ''They were just defined at an early age by the fact that others saw them that way.'' At this she gave a nervous laugh. ''I feel like all of a sudden I'm talking about myself.''\n\n''Me Without You'' is new territory for Ms. Williams. It charts the dysfunctional, codependent bond between the charismatic and overbearing Marina (Anna Friel) and the insecure and bookish Holly (Ms. Williams) as they grow up in London and Brighton in the late 1970's and 80's. Marina envies Holly's traditional Jewish family, while Holly is impressed with Marina's mother, a former croupier. Ms. Goldbacher said wasn't sure at first that Ms. Williams would be right for the part, given her previous roles. Then Ms. Goldbacher met her.\n\n''She just sounded like Holly,'' Ms. Goldbacher said by telephone from London. ''Her humor, her self-deprecation, her awareness of the lighter side of her neuroses in a New York sort of way. At the same time, she had this kind of European stillness, which draws you to her and is very cinematic.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
