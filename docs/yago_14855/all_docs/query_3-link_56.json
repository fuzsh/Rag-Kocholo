        "text": "You wouldn’t consider Michelle Williams meek and mild, especially if you are a fan of the television series Dawson’s Creek.\n\nFor nine months out of the year, the actress plays the sexy and brassy Jen on the popular WB show, breaking hearts wherever she goes.\n\nYet, during the show’s hiatus, Williams manages to find small but interesting films to make in which she plays decidedly more introspective characters. A few years ago she played a teenager quietly infatuated with President Nixon in the comedy Dick opposite Kirsten Dunst, and will play a depressed teen opposite Christina Ricci in the independent film Prozac Nation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn her latest indie effort, the British drama Me Without You, Williams is Holly, a bookish and plain girl whose deep friendship with the wild and beautiful Marina (Anna Friel) turns progressively more destructive after Holly falls in love with Marina’s brother. Over the span of 30 years, Holly realizes Marina’s true obsessive and jealous nature and finally breaks away, getting her guy in the process.\n\nWe had a chat with Williams about the film to find out what she thought of being the lone American in a cast of British actors and why she gravitates towards these intellectual characters so different from her Dawson’s Creek persona.\n\nWhat was it about Me Without You that grabbed you?\n\nMichelle Williams: I was very curious about looking into my own relationships with my girlfriends. What was wrong with them and what was right with them, and how they have been such a big part of my life. When I read the script, I knew I had a lot to say about it. It really got to me.\n\nHave you ever a friend who dominated the relationship?\n\nWilliams: Definitely. I think it’s easy to be attracted to people like that. It’s very easy to lose yourself in that and have the other person make all the decisions. Pretty destructive.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAll the actors on the film were fairly new, giving the movie a very fresh quality.\n\nWilliams: Yeah, it was exciting and we all got along really well. We shot part of the film on the Isle of Mann, which is kind of a desolate so all we really had was each other. So we took advantage of that.\n\nHow did you find your character Holly?\n\nWilliams: We had a two-week rehearsal, which is pretty decent for an independent film. [Director] Sandra Goldbacher came up with a list of books, films, music images and art that inspired her and that we thought would inspire Holly. Darker, more intellectual stuff–books from authors such as Proust, Beaudelaire and Sylvia Plath. I spent a lot of time reading the things she loved and listened to.\n\nWas developing a British accent tough?\n\nWilliams: I had a lot of help, dialect coaches. I was in London for a while and heard it around me wherever I went. You sort of learn it through osmosis; you kind of just absorb. But when I went back to my American accent, some people were a little affronted, like I had been lying to them!\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn Dawson’s Creek you play someone very strong and sexy, yet the choices you make in your films, like this one and in the comedy Dick, you play meeker, more intellectual women. Is this a conscious choice?\n\nWilliams: I don’t think I’m consciously drawn to those characters at this point in my life [but] I do certainly notice an affinity for those characters in myself.\n\nBut you are not at all mousy!\n\nWilliams: Oh, you don’t see me when I’m hanging around my apartment.\n\nYou seem to like to make such quirky independents during your time off from Dawson’s Creek.\n\nWilliams: I’m just trying to be honest. I don’t have any financial responsibilities to anybody or to myself because I do Dawson’s Creek nine months out of the year. So really the only responsibility I have is a creative one. And that’s great–it’s really freeing.\n\n[PAGEBREAK]\n\nAre you all great friends on Dawson’s Creek?\n\nWilliams: We are like one big, happy dysfunctional family. We’d all do anything for each other. But we have one more season and then that’s it.\n\nWhat’s going to happen to Jen and Dawson?\n\nWilliams: Don’t think anything is going to happen between them.\n\nWell, you gave it a good try.\n\nWilliams: Yes, I did. But I’m not the love of his life, whaddaya gonna do?\n\nYou need to slap Dawson around, that’s what! Are there any juicy tidbits about the upcoming season you could divulge?\n\nWilliams: I wish I knew! Nobody ever tells me these things.\n\nOh, come on, give us something, anything.\n\nWilliams: I swear! I have absolutely no idea what’s going to happen next season. I don’t even think the writers know what’s going to happen next season. I just hope it’ll be as fun as last year. Irreverent–and easy.\n\nOf all the mediums in which you’ve worked, TV, movies, theater, which do you prefer?\n\nWilliams: They all have their special thing to offer. I don’t know how to weigh them. Television can be very grueling and hard work. But I work hard on films as well.\n\nWhat has been a career high for you?\n\nWilliams: Right now! I feel like I’ve eaten a big cheeseburger. I feel really satisfied the way things have gone recently–I’m pretty happy."
