        "text": "In January of 2015, I decided I’d start keeping a list of all the movies I watched. I figured it would be nice to look back on, it would help me keep track of what I see and when I see it, and it might be interesting to find out just how many movies I watch in a year. By the end of the year, I had watched 372 movies. I have to admit, this was a lot more than I had expected when I started my list in January. I like movies, but I didn’t think my average would end up at more than one per day. So, in January of 2016, when I heard about the 52 films by women challenge, I figured it would be easy. The goal of the challenge is to watch one movie a week made by a female director. I thought surely I had already done that, or at least come close the year before, so why not do it officially in 2016. I went back to add up how many female directed films I had watched in 2015. In a year where I watched 372 movies, only 14 were by women. I watched more than a movie a day and yet I had barely watched one by a woman per month. Safe to say, I was pretty surprised by this information. Some of my favorite movies and ones that I watch multiple times a year are made by women. I try to make an effort to see female directed films, especially smaller ones that need support. I talk about how much we need female voices in the film industry. And yet I only watched 14 movies by women. That’s when I began the 52 films by women challenge, and I’m really glad I did.\n\nI found that the challenge helped me reevaluate and rediscover many movies that were influential at some point for me growing up, like Amy Heckerling’s Clueless or Penelope Spheeris’ Wayne’s World. The first time I saw these movies years ago I wasn’t thinking about who directed them; I just knew I loved them. It’s nice to know that female directors had a part in some of the movies that got me interested in movies. Along with childhood favorites, there are also movies that were a big part of my teenage years. In October, I did my annual rewatch of Jennifer’s Body, my personal favorite cult film since I saw it at 15. Looking back now and knowing that the film was written by Diablo Cody and directed by Karyn Kusama, I can’t say I’m surprised that female perspective of the film resonated with me on some level.\n\nIn addition to old favorites, there were also a number of new releases by women that I loved. Movies like Mustang, The Edge of Seventeen and American Honey were some of my most enjoyable theater going experiences this year. The Invitation, also directed by Karyn Kusama, was released on VOD in April and is one of the best movies I’ve seen this year. Ana Lily Amirpour’s The Bad Batch was one of my highlights of the Toronto International Film Festival this year. Ava DuVernay’s 13th, a documentary about racism in relation to the prison industrial complex is essential viewing, especially this year.\n\nI also discovered some new favorites this year that I probably wouldn’t have come across if not for the 52FBW challenge. Movies like Sandra Goldbacher’s Me Without You, an exploration of toxic female friendships with fantastic performances from Michelle Williams and Anna Friel. This year I also saw Ravenous, directed by Antonia Bird, a black comedy/horror movie about 19th century cannibals in the California mountains. I hadn’t heard much about either of these movies before seeing them and they both pleasantly surprised me.\n\nWhat I was disappointed by was the fact that for many female directors, their films are far and few between. For many men, one successful small film is all it takes for them to be handed the keys to major blockbuster opportunities. Take for example Josh Trank or Colin Trevorrow. They made Chronicle and Safety Not Guaranteed in 2012, respectively. After that they were both given the opportunity to make huge blockbusters in 2015. While Trank’s Fantastic Four reboot was commercially and critically unsuccessful, Trevorrow’s Jurassic World was the second highest grossing film of the year. Sometimes giving $100+ million budget a director with one successful film under their belt works out and other times it doesn’t. What is a guarantee is that whether one is successful or not will have nothing to do with another man being chosen to direct the next big budget film. For women it often feels like if they’re given the chance and fail that just gives a studio an excuse to say there’s no point in hiring a female director again.\n\nHowever, things are beginning to change. With her adaptation of A Wrinkle In Time set for release in 2018, Ava DuVernay will be the first woman of color to direct a live action film with a budget over $100 million. Next summer Patty Jenkins’s Wonder Woman film will come out, her first feature film since Monster in 2003. I’m optimistic about both of these movies and I think they have the ability to be hugely successful. I just hope if they’re not, we don’t let one failure speak for the work of an entire gender.\n\nOn a personal level, I think the challenge has changed how I evaluate films made by women. While there are many female directed films I watched this year that I loved, there are also movies that disappointed me. I had high hopes for movies like Goodnight Mommy, co-directed by Veronika Franz, or Divines, the debut feature from Houda Benyamina. While both these movies had promise, I ultimately felt their problems overshadowed their strengths. Initially I was disappointed in my own reaction to them. They’re both critically successful and I want to like and support movies by women, so shouldn’t I have enjoyed them? I think my desire to support female directors and my knowledge that all too often the work of one woman becomes representative of all women makes me feel guilty for disliking them. The reality is it’s just not possible to like every movie. As much as I love to see movies by women succeed, sometimes they won’t. And that’s ok. Women have to be allowed to fail. I have to be able to look at these movies objectively and appreciate the ones I like and criticize the ones I don’t, or else I also fall into the trap of using one female director to represent them all.\n\nOverall, I found the 52 films by women challenge to be hugely beneficial for me. It opened my eyes to new movies and it helped me reevaluate old ones. As much as there were plenty of movies I loved, there were ones I disliked, and I’ve learned that one way or another, I can’t let one director represent all female filmmakers. Looking ahead to 2017, I plan on doing the challenge again. My goal is to find more movies that are new, or at least new to me. I want to see more movies by women of color and foreign films that don’t always get the attention they deserve in North America. I also want to make sure that this challenge continues to help me evaluate the films I watch. While the challenge is specific to female directors, I find that I’m becoming more aware of the work of women involved in other areas, such as writing and producing. I’d like to get to a point where I don’t need a challenge to make sure I watch plenty of movies by women but until then I’m glad I have this one to encourage me."
