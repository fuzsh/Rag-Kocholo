ME WITHOUT YOU tells the story of the intense best friendship between Holly (Michelle Williams) and Marina (Ann Friel), two girls who won't - or can't - let each other go. One long, hot summer in seventies London, Holly and Marina make a childhood pact to be friends forever. For troubled, unpredictable Marina, whose vulnerability is well-concealed beneath a selfish, sadistic streak, the mousy Holly remains the only loyal constant in a life of divorcing parents, experimental drugs and fashionable self-destruction. The girls turn to each other as they begin to experience all that life has to offer: sex, love, loss and rock 'n roll. For Holly, however, a friendship that has never been equal gradually begins to feel like a trap and their relationship becomes increasingly claustrophobic as both women collude in a destructive bond that ultimately interferes with growing up."
