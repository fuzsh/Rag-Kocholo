        "text": "Distinguished by Anna Friel's constantly changing barnet, \"Me Without You\" may well be that rare bird - the internationally accessible British film.\n\nThe story concerns two childhood pals, Marina (Friel) and Holly (Williams). Having made a pact during the hot summer of 1973 to be friends forever, the duo inevitably fall in and out of kinship over the next two decades. For such a simple set-up, what follows is surprisingly entertaining stuff.\n\nMarina is beautiful and wild - the product of a glamorous mother and inattentive father. Mousy, hardworking Holly (Williams), meanwhile, has only ever been taught by her dour mother that it's better to be clever than pretty. The two girls experiment with drugs together, go to the same uni, and unknowingly share lovers, in a symbiotic friendship which threatens to suffocate them both as they grow older.\n\nFriel seems born to play the good-time girl, while Williams exercises her acting chops with a perfect English accent and subtle study of longing. Also excellent are MacLachlan as an amusingly pretentious and predatory lecturer; Styler's glamourpuss mum; and Milburn, who plays Marina's older brother and the object of Holly's affection."
