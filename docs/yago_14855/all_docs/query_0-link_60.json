        "text": "Anna Friel lies on the bed with her legs in the air. Between one of her painted toes she holds a lighted cigarette. She moves the cigarette to her mouth and inhales. This is one of the memorable scenes in her new film Me Without You, and one that will make those men who set up websites to celebrate Friel and her accomplishments whimper like small woodland animals. Or make Jack Nicholson, who saw Friel play a stripper on stage in Broadway and said he could not rest until he had slept with her, obsess about Friel all over again.\n\nDid you really smoke with your foot or was it just a trick? \"Of course I did,\" says the 25-year old former Brookside star and, without any further ado, lifts her leg and bends her foot to her lips. We're sitting on a sofa in a pub in Clerkenwell, the district of London where she lives with her boyfriend, actor David Thewlis. Her feat is all the more extraordinary since, even though it's 4pm, she's only been up two hours, after partying rather too heartily at a wrap party the previous evening.\n\n\"It was my idea to smoke with my feet,\" says Friel proudly. \"I was messing around at home one day and I thought if me and Michelle [Williams, who plays Holly] were lying on the bed together and I smoked with my foot it would give the physical intimacy the film needed.\"\n\nMe Without You, directed and co-written by Sandra Goldbacher, is a coming of age story dealing with the intense friendship between two middle-class English girls from 1973 to the present day. Though it's got its flaws, the film is quite easily Friel's most accomplished cinematic performance so far, not least because in Marina she has found a character that demands that she covers the breadth of her range - from red-nosed waif clutching her knees with that taut lower lip and pouting, sculpted upper lip, to feisty sexpot seducing Kyle MacLachlan's university lecturer.\n\n\"I'm a naturalistic actor and the public finds me very endearing. That was the secret of my success on Brookside. And I think that's because I so clearly empathise with the characters I'm playing. \"\n\nThis is particularly true of her performance here. She's ballsy but vulnerable, shallow yet sensitive, a character whose psychic troubles and compensating aggressiveness are explained by her family background. Marina has a valium-addicted ex-croupier for a mother and a clownish absentee father. The only fixture in Marina's life is Holly, the nice Jewish girl who lives in the mock Tudor house next door. She's the flipside to flawed, fluffheaded Marina. Holly is intellectual, immersed in Sylvia Plath in her youth, worrying about the impact of deconstructionist theory as a student, and in later years (no surprises this) agonising over Her Novel.\n\n\"On the first day we turned up at the director's house. The director said, 'I'm going to leave you in the room now. Here are some props and when I come back I want you both to be best friends and 12 years old. I'll be back in an hour.' Then she'd come back and say, 'Now you're 16.' And later, 'Now you're 21.' Each time she'd disappear for an hour and we had to improvise. It was a really embarrassing process at first because I hardly knew Michelle, but it really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and create an intense friendship on screen.\n\n\"I loved the concept so much - the idea of a film about two close, perhaps over-close, women friends. I had a friendship until I was about 16 with a girl called Claire which was like that.\"\n\nThe director Sandra Goldbacher comments: \"I've spoken to so many women who've had the same almost addictively over-close friendships, which, if you try to sustain them beyond childhood can be quite suffocating. The film tells the story of how claustrophobic and obsessive a bond, that's originally so exhilarating, can become.\"\n\nDespite a great pyre of period detail, assembled no doubt to woo nostalgists, Me Without You is marked by a good-heartedness that, in no small measure, is down to Friel's performance. Her part almost sinks under the weight of reference. In 1973, we see Marina in pop socks, wiggling a hula hoop on her hips. In 1978, she's a Siouxsie Sioux clone, trudging across Hampstead Heath to a party of hard drugs and casual sex in PVC mini-skirt, thick black tights and ill-advised white pixie boots. She spends much of the 80s dressed Ã  la Cyndi Lauper. By the 90s, she's mutated into Magenta De Vine with Louise Brooks bob and Jackie O shades.\n\n\"I loved all that, learning to dance like they did in the early 80s, and all the costume changes. I'm slightly too young for the role, so I didn't really get all the references. But David did and he was always playing the music from the time, telling me what was cool and what was not.\"\n\nBy a considerable margin, this is the best film that Anna Friel has ever appeared in. But, many say, that's not saying much. She's been in more than her fair share of disastrous films. Her big screen career started ignominiously in 1997 when she starred in Pawel Pawlikowski's little-seen The Stringer, a Moscow-set drama in which she played the head of a CNN-like TV news outfit. Pawlikowski recalls bitterly that his film would only be granted funding from British Screen if the female lead was a star: \"The female character was totally underdeveloped, so no English star would want to do it. Apart from Anna Friel, and she was sort of bankable, but she had a very limited range. There was a complete idiocy at the heart of the whole thing. Thank God it wasn't distributed.\"\n\nFriel, not surprisingly, remembers the experience differently. \"I was completely on my own for eight weeks living in one of those Stalinist blocks in Moscow with mafia guys calling me asking for sex. I was just 19. I've never seen the film.\"\n\nShe has fonder memories of her subsequent film, The Land Girls. In it she played Prue, a vivacious, sexy northerner pitted against Rachel Weisz's reserved Cambridge student in a period drama about the Women's Land Army, formed in 1941 to put women to work on English farms whose men have gone off to war.\"I loved that film,\" says Friel. \"David Leland [the writer-director] was so wonderful to work with. And it wasn't a failure as some people said: somebody told me that it had the highest viewing figures on Channel 4 of any film apart from some Tom Cruise blockbuster.\"\n\nThe following year, she appeared in Rogue Trader, the story of the fall of Barings trader Nick Leeson. Critics universally agreed it was terrible. The same held true for the Kathy Lette adaptation Mad Cows, hailed by our own critic Peter Bradshaw as \"so astonishingly bad it made me break out in a thin film of cold sweat... One to forget, for all concerned.\"\n\nI remind Friel that her unfortunate Hollywood movie, Sunset Strip, in which she plays (it says here) \"a sexually liberated fashion designer\" in tragi-comic bob and feather boa, is coming out on video next month. \"It's not is it?\" she wails, punching me in the stomach. \"Oh God. That was a terrible film. We had to make up the story on the spot. It was hopeless.\"\n\nShe did, though, like working on the Barry Levinson film An Everlasting Piece, about two Ulstermen selling toupees to the stressed baldies of the British Army and the IRA. \"It was funnier than you'd think.\"\n\nFriel continues: \"I haven't found my niche yet. I know that.\" Do you think you've made some bad choices? \"No, not really. But there aren't all that many options, particularly in Britain where not many films are made - and even fewer good ones. But I'm loving my career and Me Without You is hopefully going to be the springboard.\"\n\nHopefully, though, she must surely have thought her career would have sprung before now. Comparison with her near contemporary Kate Winslet is interesting in this respect. Friel was born in Rochdale in July 1976, Winslet in Reading in October 1975. Winslet's film career boasts a CV of cunning judgment and, quite probably, good luck, starting with Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures in 1994, a fascinating study of a screwy adolescent female friendship, and following it up with substantial performances in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Michael Winterbottom's adaptation of Hardy's Jude the Obscure. And all this before she starred in the biggest grossing movie ever, bobbing along with Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic.\n\nYou must have looked on Winslet's works and despaired? \"Not really. She's been very lucky, but I'm loving what I'm doing and working really hard. My career has had many disappointments,\" says Friel. \"The one I really cried about was a film where I would have been with Michael Caine in every scene. It was the story of the first convicts who were sent to Australia, but they lost half their money at the last minute.\"\n\nShe alludes to an intriguing shadow career of performances that might have been. \"I turned down The Mummy. I turned down a lot of rubbish films, all that kung fu chop-chop stuff.\" But the career-making role she missed by a whisker was the female lead opposite DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's forthcoming Gangs of New York. \"I worked on the film for one day and then the producers called and said, 'Cameron [Diaz] wants to do it.' So I was out. I could understand them, though: I'd have chosen her.\"\n\nDoesn't she sometimes wish she was back on Brookside, in which she starred between 1993 and 1995? Then, at least, she was watched three times a week by nine million people. She became a lesbian icon for her ground-breaking snog with Margaret. As Beth Jordache, she was the subject of an extraordinary cult. \"Free the Brookside Two!\" yelled the banners when she and her on-screen mother Mandy, who had killed the abusive father Trevor and buried him under the patio, were jailed for their crimes. Those were the days, weren't they? \"God, no. I was in it for two years and that was enough. I always wanted to be a film star.\"\n\nSadly from that point of view, her best roles have been on the stage. She was a stripper in Patrick Marber's Closer and a great hit both sides of the Atlantic in Wedekind's Lulu. Of the latter she says, \"It's not easy getting brutally raped and murdered each night and then the following night coming back as a sexy pierrot doll.\"\n\n\"My ambitions don't go all that far. All I want to do is work with directors I really admire. Coppola, Jane Campion, Scorsese, Danny Boyle. My French is pretty good, you know. I would work for a French director. But now,\" says Friel, \"I'm knackered from working too much. I'm going to Brazil on holiday.\""
