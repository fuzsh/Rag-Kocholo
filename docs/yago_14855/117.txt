The beauty and potency of friendship is brought to the fore in Sandra Goldbacherâ€™s energetic film. Part-period piece set in the heyday of 1980s London and Brighton, and given life and vivacity by two charming performances from soon-to-be stars Michelle Williams and Anna Friel, Me Without You is a charming, melancholic ode to the relationships we leave behind.

Me Without You is an unconventional relationship drama - it's brutally honest about friendship dynamics and has incredible insight into the female experience of growing up, thanks to a wise, warm script from Goldbacher. Williams and Friel display amazing chemistry as well as inhabiting their roles with grace and complexity. Goldbacher's film is a particularly special one in that it doesn't glamorise friendships and acknowledges that they can sometimes become tiring and toxic. Goldbacher's direction, along with the strong pair of performances from Williams and Friel, works to uncover the complicated mixtures of benefits and detriments in a long-lasting relationship while acknowledging the impact time might have on the connection.
