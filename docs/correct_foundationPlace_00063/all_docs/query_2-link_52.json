However, its developer’s history regarding user data, as well as its fairly steep price as a stand-alone product, make AVG VPN a tough sell for both businesses and users.\n\nTo see if it is a worthwhile investment on its own, we did a deep dive into the system’s key features, policies and performance.\n\nPros\n\nClean, easy-to-understand interface\n\nUp to 10 simultaneous connections\n\nCons\n\nLacks several key features, such as Dedicated IP\n\nNonexistent no-logs policy\n\nQuestionable company history regarding privacy\n\nFairly high price for what you’re getting\n\nExpensive renewal pricing\n\nLearn More\n\nOn AVG's Website\n\n2.2\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

In 2016, parent company Avast purchased VPN developer Privax, developers of HideMyAss (HMA). As part of the acquisition, AVG stated that HMA’s VPN offering would be added to AVG’s existing suite of security apps. And much like its antivirus offering, AVG VPN shares much of its DNA with Avast VPN.\n\nPros\n\nAVG VPN’s only real selling points are its unlimited simultaneous connections and the ability to bundle it with AVG Ultimate. While the simultaneous connections are nice, other providers with more features do the same thing, such as Surfshark. Bundling with AVG Ultimate is nice in theory, but it’s only really worth it if you are already an AVG customer to begin with.\n\nCons\n\nThe service is devoid of several key features, such as dedicated IP, making it a difficult sell for business users. Plus, the company’s past with logging user data as well as its lack of a no-logs policy, raise too many red flags for personal users, in our opinion. The service’s high price compared to what you’re getting is also a major downside.\n\nAVG VPN Core Features\n\nWhile lacking in key features, AVG VPN has some of the features you’d expect from a standard VPN. You can go on the internet from another location, such as the U.K. or Germany; it features a kill switch to keep your traffic from leaking out when not connected to the VPN; and it has basic DNS protection measures, meaning your IP address won’t leak while using the service.\n\nDNS Protection Measures\n\nThe DNS protection measures successfully passed our attempts to check if the service is working. Using websites, such as DNSleaktest.com, we found no evidence of our DNS leaking at all.\n\nKill Switch\n\nWe were unable to actually test AVG VPN’s kill switch feature. According to the feature description and the app’s settings, the kill switch only engages when you suddenly lose connection to your VPN but does not stop traffic if you just turn the VPN off. Other VPNs tend to cut off all traffic not routed through the VPN when a kill switch is enabled, which is much easier to test.\n\nSplit Tunneling\n\nSplit tunneling is only available on AVG VPN’s Android app. Users of other platforms including Windows or iOS are out of luck. When we tested the feature, it worked as well as expected, successfully routing traffic away from the VPN with selected apps.\n\nAVG VPN Pricing and Plans\n\nLength of Contract Yearly Two-Year Three-Year\n\nMonthly Rate\n\n$4.49\n\n$4.39\n\n$4.39\n\nTotal Amount Billed\n\n$53.88 for the first year, $99.99 for every year after\n\n$105.36 for the first two years, $194.99 for every two years after\n\n$158.04 for the first three years, $294.99 for every three years after\n\n30-Day Guarantee\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nAVG VPN Setup\n\nSetting up AVG VPN was straightforward. You simply purchase the subscription, download and run the installer and select which server you want to connect to.\n\nWhen we attempted to set up on Android, we did encounter trouble using our username and password to log in, instead being forced to use an activation code. This is not a big issue, but it’s worth noting for users who might find themselves frustrated trying to get AVG VPN to work on Android.\n\nAVG VPN Ease of Use\n\nWe found AVG VPN to be incredibly easy to use. The interface is simple, the settings are understandable and everything is laid out very legibly.\n\nOf course, this is exactly what we would expect from a VPN with no real complexity to speak of. When your most complicated feature is a kill switch, your app should be very easy to use. While AVG VPN clears this bar, it is not exceptional for doing so.\n\nAVG VPN Servers and Locations\n\nAVG VPN has 59 server locations in 37 countries. More accurately, it’s 58 locations. Two of the servers listed, Wonderland in the U.K. and Gotham City in the U.S., reference fictional locations and are dedicated to streaming. These do connect to real locations in each country, however. Wonderland is based in London, which already has its own server location. Gotham City’s server is in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nAVG VPN has earmarked six of these server locations as being dedicated to streaming, and 8 are dedicated to torrenting. However, between AVG VPN’s poor performance at accessing region-locked content (see below) and the company’s nonexistent no-logs policy, we would not recommend using the VPN for either activity.\n\nFictional locations aside, the server and location count are extremely small compared to other VPNs in the space, such as Proton VPN. During periods of high traffic, this small count could lead to bottlenecking and throttled Internet speeds while using the service.\n\nAVG VPN Speed and Performance\n\nAVG VPN currently supports the following protocols:\n\nMimic: AVG’s proprietary protocol. It is designed to bypass methods of blocking VPN traffic by appearing as HTTPS traffic. While AVG likes touting Mimic as unique, you can find similar functions from other providers under different names, such as VyprVPN’s Chameleon protocol.\n\nOpenVPN: OpenVPN is a free and open-source security protocol commonly used by most VPN providers. It is one of the oldest security protocols in the VPN space, being initially released in 2001. It is a solid, if unremarkable protocol by today’s standards.\n\nWireGuard: The current standard-bearer of VPN protocols, WireGuard is a free and open-source security protocol known for its speeds and consistency. Many VPNs use WireGuard as their default protocol, even in cases where a proprietary protocol exists.\n\nProtocol Average Upload Speed Average Download Speed Average Upload Ping Average Download Ping\n\nNo VPN\n\n399.3 Mbps\n\n352.5 Mbps\n\n8.25 ms\n\n11.2 ms\n\nWireGuard\n\n338.5 Mbps\n\n384.1 Mbps\n\n9.95 ms\n\n15.7 ms\n\nOpenVPN\n\n242.9 Mbps\n\n304.6 Mbps\n\n7.55 ms\n\n15.25 ms\n\nMimic\n\n261.9 Mbps\n\n243.4 Mbps\n\n141.6 ms\n\n189.1 ms\n\nAVG VPN’s speeds are roughly on par with those of major players in the space, such as NordVPN. As usual, the best protocol to use is the open-source WireGuard, thanks to its high speeds and relatively low impact on device performance. AVG’s proprietary protocol Mimic is not recommended for streaming, gaming or video chatting due to its high amount of ping compared to other protocols.\n\nAVG VPN Security and Privacy\n\nAVG VPN’s security measures leave much to be desired. There is no multifactor authentication or an account system that safely anonymizes users. On top of that, AVG VPN does not have any sort of no-logs policy, leaving it out of step with the majority of providers we cover.\n\nWhile the veracity or transparency of a company’s no-logs policy varies wildly, the fact that AVG VPN has no policy to speak of leaves us with many concerns about its ability to protect user privacy. This is especially true when AVG and parent company Avast have been caught selling user data through their free antivirus service before.\n\nAlthough the company has no such history with its VPN as of this writing, its willingness to do so for other products in the past leaves us unable to trust the company or its service. In a cybersecurity space, even a primarily consumer-focused one such as VPNs, trust is the most important currency a company trades in.\n\nWhen you use a VPN, you are trusting that company to safely handle your data and internet traffic. If you cannot place trust in a provider, you should avoid using it. While the company has not had any major incidents since the aforementioned data collection scandal, we do not believe companies in such a highly trust-focused environment deserve a second chance with users’ data, especially with how intentional the company’s data harvesting was.\n\nAVG VPN Customer Service and Support\n\nAVG VPN has access to the same customer service and support features as AVG antivirus. This means, on top of live chat and a knowledge base, AVG VPN is one of the few VPNs with an actual phone service. This would, in theory, make AVG VPN one of the more accessible VPNs in terms of customer support.\n\nThat being said, we tried to use both the phone and live chat customer support services. Unfortunately, neither of them worked. Phone support did not pick up despite multiple calls, and live chat was just unavailable entirely. We tried live chat twice and received the same error both times.\n\nAVG VPN Device Compatibility\n\nAVG VPN is available on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. While AVG has browser extensions for other services, it has none to speak of specifically for VPNs.\n\nAVG VPN for Streaming\n\nWe tested AVG VPN for streaming on Disney+, Hulu and Netflix. While we were able to get Netflix working, we were not successful with Disney+ or Hulu. The streaming experience on Netflix, using one of AVG VPN’s dedicated streaming servers, was fine but nothing spectacular. It outperforms some VPNs by accessing Netflix at all, but we think there are better options for a streaming VPN for a similar price.\n\nAVG VPN Alternatives and How They Compare\n\nAVG VPN ExpressVPN hide.me Mullvad VPN\n\nRating\n\nStarting Monthly Price\n\n$4.39 (with a two- or three-year contract)\n\n$8.32 (with annual contract)\n\n$3.84 (with a 26-month contract)\n\n$5.29\n\nAnonymous Browsing\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nDNS Protection Measures\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nDedicated IP\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nKill Switch\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSplit Tunneling\n\nOnly on Android\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nMultifactor Authentication\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNot necessary\n\nNo-Logs Policy\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nLearn More\n\n–\n\nRead Reviews\n\n–\n\nWe normally review how the VPN in question stacks up with its competitors. However, in this case, we see no reason to do so, as AVG VPN lacks key features, a commitment to privacy and charges high price, giving it almost no edge over its competition. The 10 simultaneous connections are only worthwhile if the service itself is worth using on any device at all. We would still prefer, as an example, Mullvad VPN’s five simultaneous connections over AVG VPN’s 10 connections.\n\nIs AVG VPN Right for You?\n\nTaking everything about AVG VPN into account, we do not recommend the service for anyone. What few pros it has do not outweigh its many cons, and most users would be better off staying away from the company entirely. For business users, it does not have essential features, such as dedicated IP, and for individual users, its privacy commitment is so lacking as to be nonexistent.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nDoes AVG antivirus include a free VPN?\n\nNo. AVG VPN is a separate service from the company’s signature Antivirus offering. However, AVG VPN can be bundled with AVG Antivirus’ Ultimate plan.\n\nDoes AVG VPN store logs?\n\nYes, AVG VPN stores connection logs and other user data. It claims to detail all the data the service collects in its Privacy Policy, but this has never been independently audited to our understanding.\n\nWhat does AVG VPN do?\n\nAnytime you surf the internet, you transmit data from your device to a website’s server. That data can contain personal information, which unsavory third parties could potentially use for nefarious purposes. A VPN, or virtual private network, essentially hides your data by rerouting your data through a privately hosted server before it reaches its destination. That way, it can’t be traced back to you.\n\nIs AVG VPN good for torrenting?\n\nNo. While AVG VPN has dedicated servers for torrenting, the provider does not have a no-logs policy. We recommend only torrenting with VPNs that you would trust with your internet traffic. Given AVG’s history of harvesting user data for monetization, we would not count AVG VPN on that list of trusted providers.\n\nInformation provided on Forbes Advisor is for educational purposes only.
