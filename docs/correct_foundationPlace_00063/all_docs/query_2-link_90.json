        "text": "Today, millions of people worldwide are connected to the internet, but this explosive growth also means a higher risk of cyberattacks. As such, everybody needs antivirus protection.\n\nAntivirus software is specifically created to help prevent, detect, and remove malicious software.\n\nOnce installed, antivirus software runs automatically in the background to provide real-time protection against viruses, spyware, ransomware, adware, and other damaging programs.\n\nAVG Antivirus is a popular anti-malware solution that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to recognize the operating patterns and warning signs of malware on your computer and online.\n\nAVG caters to both users who need a basic layer of protection and those looking for robust security.\n\nAs you turn on your computer, AVG antivirus software works in the background and alerts you when it discovers a cyber threat.\n\nThe program also puts the infected files in a separate place, so you cannot accidentally access them. You can easily remove these files with just a few clicks.\n\nAVG Antivirus offers unique features like a phone tracker, and not only does it score high in malware detection tests, but it also protects you from ransomware. There is also a free version of AVG Antivirus for you to first try out its software.\n\nSo, what kind of protection does this free service offer you? And if you upgrade for a paid version, how well are you protected?\n\nIn this AVG review, we will look at its features, pricing plans, user interface, and more.\n\nAVG Antivirus – Quick Summary\n\nAVG Antivirus is one of the best free antiviruses out there. And if you wish to upgrade to a higher tier, its basic package also can ensure your device’s safety.\n\nMoreover, it is userfriendly, easy to download and install, and doesn’t require many resources to run either.\n\nThe company behind the product, AVG Technologies, has been around for over two decades. In 2016, it was acquired by multinational cybersecurity software company Avast Software.\n\nToday, it is better than ever, offering tons of benefits and protection to its users.\n\nLet’s take a look at what AVG has to offer you, where it wins and where it lacks in this AVG review.\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nFeatures:\n\nEasy to download and install\n\nPassive mode\n\nScan controls\n\nSensitive data shield\n\nAnti-theft phone tracker\n\nSeveral enticing bonus features\n\nReal-time protection\n\nAVG Review: Features Explained\n\nAVG’s antivirus has plenty of useful features that back up its popularity and a strong reputation for security and performance.\n\nTake a look at what exactly you get here, as well as some of its drawbacks.\n\nDownload and Installation\n\nDownloading the AVG program is pretty fast and takes only about a few minutes. As for installing the software, AVG makes it easy for anyone to do it by providing easy instructions for installing the system.\n\nTo download the free version, which can be done with just a few clicks, you don’t even need an account.\n\nBut creating an account allows you to easily monitor all your devices under AVG’s plan. If you want to change your password, you can do so in the Settings menu, create a “white list,” and control pop-up windows.\n\nOnce you are done installing the software, make sure that you uncheck the box for data collection, which can be done by going to the Menu, where you have to select General and then Privacy option.\n\nWhen running AVG, you’ll get a black background with green text, which is pretty clean and decreases eye strain, but of course, not everyone likes the dark color scheme.\n\nIts current interface is very straightforward and user friendly with the front panel featuring an evaluation of your protection and a “Fix All” button to correct all issues covered by your plan.\n\nOn the function page, you will see a green “Upgrade” button, which is placed at the top of every panel, if you want better protection and more features.\n\nPassive Mode\n\nIf you already have a built-in antivirus app on your computer, no worries, you can still download AVG as a backup.\n\nThis is because of the passive mode that allows it to run as backup virus protection without interfering with your primary antivirus program. It will also alert you in case it caches anything missed by your primary malware detection program.\n\nAVG’s antivirus scanner is always on and keeping track of any changes you make to files and folders to ensure that you are always in the know about what is happening all the time.\n\nScan Feature\n\nYou can launch a quick scan with a single click which is quite effective at running through the most vulnerable areas of your system.\n\nIf you do more thorough scanning, the Deep Scan will go through the deepest and darkest corners of your device.\n\nAVG’s USB/DVD Scan meanwhile examines the removable drives, and the Performance scan finds issues in your system.\n\nIts customization options allow you to choose when and how your virus scans happen.\n\nYou can basically schedule scans for a specific time, adjust the intensity of the scans, and even exclude specific files from being scanned.\n\nThe quick scan option, which is not included in its free package, can take about two minutes for the first time but takes less time scanning the more in use it gets, cutting the time to only about thirty seconds.\n\nSensitive Data Shield\n\nTo protect your sensitive data, AVG’s Data Shield is there to hide all your vulnerable information from hackers.\n\nAvailable only to paid users in the AVG Internet Security package, the Sensitive Data Shield feature protects your most important files by controlling which applications or programs have access to them.\n\nSo, if a hacker finds a way around the blocks put in place by AVG, they still won’t be able to access your data.\n\nPerforming an automatic scan will identify your sensitive files, which will then be marked by the software as highly personal.\n\nIt will limit your files’ access to other apps. If an untrusted application tries to access these marked files, you will get a notification prompting you to either allow or block the access.\n\nAnti-Theft Phone Tracker\n\nThe Android version of AVG Antivirus allows you to protect your device in case it gets lost or stolen. To set it up, just enable the feature and set up a PIN code.\n\nYou can also select which accounts are allowed to make remote changes to it. it will allow you to log in to your AVG account and access your phone from a distance and erase all data on your phone.\n\nAll of these features are available in its free plan, according to our AVG review..\n\nAs a paid user, you can set up automatic locking if the screen lock is entered incorrectly a number of times and also set up additional actions.\n\nSecret camera mode is an interesting feature of the AVG Antivirus program that turns on when your phone is marked as lost.\n\nThe phone sneakily takes a picture of whoever is holding it in its hand and uploads it to your AVG account, which can then help identify the thief and find your stolen phone.\n\nReal-Time Protection\n\nTo ensure utmost protection, AVG Antivirus offers real-time functionality through its industry-leading AI-based solution to discover and learn about new threats.\n\nThese threats are discovered without having to scan every file you download or open.\n\nThanks to this, AVG runs a check for anything suspicious, along with domain meta information and visual elements while the page is loading.\n\nAVG’s paid-only enhanced firewall meanwhile is designed to monitor all incoming and outgoing connections on your network and can be preset as you want.\n\nIts advanced firewalls also protect your computer against ransomware, a popular form of malware that encrypts your files and then holds them for “ransom” in exchange for a payment.\n\nAVG Antivirus also does a great job spotting phishing attacks, which usually target users through email.\n\nAVG Internet Security scans wi-fi networks, as well.\n\nAs for the anti-spam, it makes sure that dangerous emails do not interfere with your email security, and Fake Website Shield detects and then blocks the copies of the original websites.\n\nAVG’s free app is a great way to get started, and if you take your computer’s health and safety seriously, AVG is worth the cost.\n\nAVG’s Pricing and Plans\n\nWith twenty years of impeccable reputation, AVG has introduced three plans to cater to the different needs of its different users. It ranges from free, expensive, to very costly based on the features offered by them.\n\nAVG Antivirus Free\n\nWhile AVG antivirus is not the cheapest product out there, its entry-level plan has a free version that offers a basic set of features and is available for both your Windows and Mac device as well as Android.\n\nAVG Antivirus Free package mainly gets you a performance scan and real-time update.\n\nThis free version does not overload your computer with annoying buttons or pop-ups either. Instead, it keeps everything simple and is perfect for those who need basic essential protection.\n\nBut availing of this plan means you will not be taking advantage of ransomware protection, webcam protection, enhanced firewall, and fake website protection offered by AVG to paid users.\n\nThis free plan does feature malware protection and blocking of dangerous links, email attachments, and websites.\n\nAVG Internet Security\n\nIf you want more than what the free version offers, you have to upgrade to the AVG Internet Security package for $69.99.\n\nWhile a bit more pricey than the industry average, this plan comes with some impressive set of features, including an unlimited number of Windows-running devices. But there are no AVG apps for Ubuntu or other Linux versions.\n\nGoing for this package also comes with the advantage of the 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nAVG also offers free trials on this paid plan which differs for different devices, for instance, 60 days trial for Mac, a 30-day trial period for PC, and 14 days each for Android and iOS.\n\nThe iOS version doesn’t have any real antivirus protection but a VPN for data breach monitoring and an increasing number of photos in a secure vault.\n\nOther benefits of using this paid service over the free version, include wi-fi protection, toolbar remover, enhanced firewall, anti-ransomware, webcam security, file shredder, anti-spam, and shield against fake websites to make your privacy even more secure.\n\nAVG Ultimate\n\nThe most expensive package is AVG Ultimate which will cost you $119.99 for one full year of protection.\n\nThis difference in price between AVG Ultimate and AVG Internet Security is due to cross-platform compatibility and the TuneUp tool that is included in the former plan.\n\nTuneUp helps speed up your PC by cleaning the junk data and improving the battery life. However, there is no money-back guarantee and no free trial here.\n\nYou do get the advantage of basic antivirus software for Mac and Android devices, which is available for free.\n\nBesides the features offered in the AVG Internet Security package, the ultimate plan will further get you automatic maintenance that makes real-time protection very reliable and independent.\n\nDisk cleaner to help avoid the overload of your PC, website cleaner, and software updater are other features that make it a great pick for someone targeting all security issues.\n\nAVG Protection and Performance\n\nAVG Antivirus is a great tool to protect your computer and other devices from viruses and any other new threats. The protection rate of AVG Antivirus from malware is also pretty impressive at 99.99%.\n\nUsing AVG antivirus means malicious software has to go through several layers of dependence to get to your device.\n\nThose that manage or breach these lines of defense, AVG runs a full scan on those unknown and suspicious files before they could be executed.\n\nThis antivirus provides you with daily updates of any new malware that pops up and blocks them when they try to attack your computers. AVG not only recognizes and removes the new threats but also sends them to its online lab for analysis.\n\nWhen it comes to phishing protection, AVG ensures that your device is safe from these attacks even in free versions. For the uninitiated, phishing is used by attackers to trick people into disclosing personal data and stealing their money.\n\nPhishing scams are usually run via emails, phone calls, messages on social media, and even fake websites that resemble their original versions.\n\nHere, AVG detects any dangerous files while paid versions of the software offer you email protection, scanning of suspicious links, payment security features, and blocking spam.\n\nAVG is Always Looking Out for You\n\nAVG Antivirus is a safe choice for your devices that does not impact your system in any negative way either.\n\nFor any software, it is virtual that it does not put any strain on the device when making the most out of its resources. And AVG antivirus emerges as a solid performer here, with even the outdated computers able to run this antivirus.\n\nThe process of protecting your computer from threats and attacks does not affect your device’s performance much.\n\nPC users report minimal impact to their computer speed while running AVG antivirus scans. This means, your computer will continue to run as it normally does smoothly while the antivirus scans it for any malware or viruses.\n\nThe company’s antivirus plans also offer a separate identity theft protection service called BreachGuard identity though it doesn’t cover dark web and financial account monitoring.\n\nAll of this shows that AVG’s high-regarded antivirus software that protects against malware, viruses, spyware, email phishing, and ransomware is safe and will not adversely impact your computer’s performance.\n\nWe’ve concluded in this AVG review that you can run the program without any worry.\n\nAVG Available Apps\n\nAVG antivirus software is compatible with everything, from Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.\n\nPC and Mac\n\nThe software is particularly a good choice for the PC crowd and works well with Windows 10 and other versions of Windows. It offers real-time protection, detects unsafe links, files, and downloads that could potentially harm your computer.\n\nIf you are a Mac owner, AVG’s free version, which is better than most entry-level packages, also works for you wonderfully.\n\nIf you are looking for more than just scanning your Mac for infected files, AVG’s paid tier will provide everything from ransomware protection, phishing protection to a wi-fi inspector for monitoring all the devices on your home network.\n\nIt is compatible with macOS 10.10 and higher. AVG’s technology ensures that none of the viruses are shared with your friends and family either even if they are using a different device.\n\nThe good thing is that it operates in a quiet mode, and you don’t even notice it working in the background.\n\niPhone and iPad\n\nAVG also has security software for your iPhone or iPad, but it isn’t antivirus software; rather, you get a VPN (virtual private network) program for a small monthly fee on your mobile device.\n\nVPNs enable users to send and receive data across public networks safely, making it harder for viruses and threats to find you so you can safely browse the web in public.\n\nAVG gives you a broad list of international locations to choose from and ensures your secure access to wi-fi and that your IP address is hidden.\n\nAndroid\n\nWhen it comes to Android apps, AVG Antivirus works for Android 6.0 (Marshmallow, API level 23) or above version. The free plan will protect you from malware and spyware and help you find your phone in case of theft.\n\nThe Pro version meanwhile provides added security in terms of allowing users to protect any app with a PIN and take pictures of anyone else who makes unsuccessful attempts to unlock your phone three times in a row.\n\nAVG basically combines its antivirus with other tools to enhance your device’s security. The security tools offered work against malware, spyware, viruses, suspicious apps, unwanted callers, and dangerous settings.\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nThis is not all, as AVG also offers free Chrome antivirus extension to help enhance your browsing experience.\n\nAVG Secure Browser extension is designed to strengthen your security and privacy while using Chrome. It is sorted into three categories.\n\nThese are website safety to protect your data as you surf the web, Ad and tracker blockers to keep your browser free of annoying ads and invasive web trackers, and password managers to keep your accounts secure with long and unique passwords.\n\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nBesides providing support for the most popular browser Chrome, AVG also caters to the users of Edge browser.
