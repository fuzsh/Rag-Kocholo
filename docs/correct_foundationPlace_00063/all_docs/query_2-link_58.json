        "text": "Just a few years ago, this would have sounded like pure science fiction... A Phoenix police officer pulled over a driverless Waymo car, after he saw it driving on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic. He stopped the car, only to find there was NOBODY in it. Who is he meant to give the ticket to? This, and much more, is discussed in the latest edition of \"The AI Fix\" #podcast with me and Mark Stockley. Find it in Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and all good podcast apps - or at https://theaifix.show/6 #artificialintelligence #waymo #robotaxi\n\nDoes your organization have the right type of CISO? Many C-suite executives assume there's a one-size-fits-all CISO, but it's more nuanced than that. Different CISO profiles, from security architects to compliance experts, align with specific organizational needs. 👇 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗜𝗦𝗢 → Thrives in fast-growing companies that scale and innovate. → Best for organizations that need a leader to champion digital transformation. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁-𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿-𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 → Excels as a crisis manager in the aftermath of a security breach. → Best for companies that need an expert to revamp and strengthen their security. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 → Has a deep understanding of compliance frameworks and legal requirements. → Best for highly regulated industries like healthcare, finance, or government. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗜𝗦𝗢 → Leverages business capabilities based on current technical/operational realities. → Best for organizations with well-established security programs that want a leader to optimize operations with business goals 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗜𝗦𝗢 → Maintains and optimizes existing security maturity. → Best for mature businesses that need consistent maintenance of established security programs. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿-𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗜𝗦𝗢 → Builds strong customer relationships to enhance a company's security image → Best for tech companies where driving user engagement translates to business success Naturally, the ideal CISO fit depends on your organization's age, industry, and unique challenges. We'd also add that the best CISOs know cybersecurity isn't a destination. Rather, it's a tool that enables businesses to keep operating.
