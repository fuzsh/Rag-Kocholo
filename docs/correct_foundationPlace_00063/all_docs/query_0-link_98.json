        "text": "THE MOST REMARKABLE MANAGERIAL CHANGES ACCORDING TO BUBENIK PARTNERS – THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022\n\nIn the nine most interesting managerial changes and transfers of the last quarter, Bubenik Partners included Czech and Slovak leaders and members of top management from various fields. The previous quarter’s onboarding to the top managerial roles of significant companies based in the Czech Republic reflects recruitment trends from the first half of the year. Businesses are increasingly hungry to strengthen senior management teams. They mainly emphasize innovation, digitization, and strategy to ensure competitiveness at a time when the skill to adapt to sudden changes is critical.\n\n„Movers and Shakers at the Top of Czech Business“ is a prestigious quarterly selection that presents a comprehensive view of what is happening on the market through the eyes of Bubenik Partners, a renowned consulting company. It is a representative overview of the most important events at the highest levels of Czech business in the given period.\n\nNew hires and transfers in the third quarter resulted from recruitment activities in the first half of this year. The number of reported changes in the top management of companies in the Czech Republic has been increasing since the pandemic. It proves that the appetite to strengthen management teams and adapt to the new challenges of the current geopolitical and economic situation is growing.\n\n„In the previous, more conservative months, companies filled positions primarily with internal candidates. The degree of external changes and the need to adapt was manifested in an increase in courage, but also in the need to recruit managers externally,“ says Jan Bubeník, founder and managing partner of Bubenik Partners. „At the same time, the number of Czech top managers returning from foreign posts also decreased, as well as the arrival of experienced expats to manage the Czech branches of their parent companies.“\n\nThis quarter also confirms the trend that we have been observing since the pandemic – the most active in changes in the top management teams are innovative companies whose sectors are doing well, such as digital, technology, and e-commerce companies, followed by those that are modernizing their business and transforming it towards digitalization, such as traditional banks and retail chains.\n\nIn recent months, companies have often recruited managers for functions covering marketing, digitization, strategy, technology, and innovation. This confirms the desire of companies to keep up with the rapid market development and to be ready for sudden changes.\n\nSelection of the most remarkable „Movers and Shakers“ at the top of Czech business in the third quarter of 2022\n\n(in alphabetical order)\n\nJan Hanuš\n\nCEO, Woltair\n\nHeat pump and photovoltaic expert Woltair has a new leader. In August, the management of the company was handed over to Jan Hanuš by the company’s founder, Daniel Helcl.\n\nThe company, founded in 2018, is aiming for one billion crowns in concluded contracts this year. „Woltair has grown, and after opening a branch in Warsaw, we are also preparing to expand to Italy and Germany. The company needs an experienced and internationally seasoned leader who will make Woltair a world player in the field of energy and decarbonization of buildings,“ says Daniel Helcl.\n\nJan Hanuš joins the company from the position of CEO of the Czech Mall Group. Before that, he led international companies such as Kostelecké uzeniny and Telenor Hungary, the third largest mobile operator in Hungary.\n\nPetr Jonák\n\nCorporate Affairs & Sustainability Director, SAZKA\n\nIn July, the lottery company Sazka from the KKCG group named an experienced manager in the field, Petr Jonák, as director of the newly established external relations and sustainability division.\n\nHis competence includes the realm of public affairs, external communication, sponsorship, social responsibility, and, newly, sustainability. The latter two mentioned areas are among Sazka’s priorities; the director’s main tasks, therefore, include strengthening them, creating strategies, and deciding on the direction of the company.\n\nPetr Jonák is also a member of the board of the Association of Industry and Transport, where he oversees sustainability and the EU internal market and covers the Association’s communications. He comes to Sazka from T-Mobile, where he worked in a similar role. Before that, he worked for Škoda, BXR, and Coca-Cola.\n\nLenka Madliaková\n\nCzech Republic Country Managing Director, Accenture\n\nIn September, Lenka Madliaková became the new Country Managing Director of the Czech branch of the consulting company Accenture.

He thus replaced Diana Rádl Rogerová, who had held this role since 2016.\n\n„My vision is Deloitte as an ‘accelerator’ of knowledge and innovation, manifested in all areas where we are involved – audit, tax, law and financial, technological and risk management consulting,“ said Svoboda.\n\nMiroslav Svoboda joined Deloitte in 2003 as a Senior Consultant and gradually worked his way up to the level of partner. Before working at Deloitte, he began his career as a tax advisor at a Brno law firm.\n\nMartin Šlégl\n\nGeneral Director, STADA Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech branch of the leading European pharmaceuticals supplier STADA welcomed a new general manager in September, who will build on its success in the local market following the acquisition of the Czech company Walmark two years ago.\n\nMartin Šlégl takes over the management of STADA’s domestic representation at a time when the company continues to grow in the local market thanks to newly emerging opportunities.\n\nHe joins STADA from IQVIA, a provider of healthcare solutions and services.

Personnel changes were approved by the Czech National Bank.\n\nWithin the ČSOB group, Martin Vašek is moving from the position of CEO of ČSOB Penzijní společnost and KBC Asset Management, a branch of ČSOB, which he has held since 2019.

Already in the second quarter, the number of recorded changes doubled compared to the first – and in the third quarter it increased even further, to four dozen recorded top management changes.\n\n„Since the spring easing of coronavirus restrictions, we have seen a gradual recovery in management recruitment. We’ve observed a growing appetite in our clients to supplement or strengthen the competencies of management teams, whether in an effort to expand business, or diversify their production and sales portfolio. The opening and development of new, usually digital, sales channels and overall technologization are also constantly continuing and accelerating,“ said Jan Bubeník, founder and managing partner of Bubenik Partners.\n\n„However, uncertainty about the economic outlook – due not only to the deteriorating epidemiological situation, but also the sharp increase in energy prices, a number of raw materials, and other production inputs – has led a good few companies to be quite conservative when filling key leadership positions and to proceed rather cautiously. At the same time, this naturally increases the need for many clients to strengthen supply chain and purchasing management – and to transform this originally internal service into a truly strategic role,“ he added.\n\nEconomic uncertainty is reflected in the fact that firms tend to give preference to internal candidates, whom they know and are in some way a „safe bet“, to external candidates, who may enrich the company with new impetus and experience, but whose integration can bring some risks. There is most likely pressure to save in an environment of general growth in consumer and producer prices, if companies try to avoid the additional costs associated with incentivizing and „onboarding“ external candidates.\n\nIn the third quarter, among the managerial changes recorded by Bubenik Partners, the share of transfers and promotions within a single company increased significantly, to the detriment of transfers between companies. The preference for internal candidates is also shown by the fact that more top management positions in local branches of multinational companies were filled in the third quarter by foreign managers moving within the global structure of the corporation.\n\n„Movers and Shakers at the Top of Czech Business“ in the third quarter of 2021\n\n(in alphabetical order)\n\nPetr Brunclík – In September, he became the new Vice President for Information Technology at one of the major players in the field of telecommunications, the Vodafone Group (he joins the company from the banking sector, where he worked at the Slovenian NLB Group as Chief Operations Officer.

The transfer of the Czech CFO to a regional role at one of the world’s leading confectionery producers also attracted our attention as one of the „Top 10“ managerial moves in our regular quarterly selection of „The Movers and Shakers at the Top of Czech Business „.\n\n„As managerial shifts in the past quarter reflect decisions made during this spring and summer, it is clear that many leadership changes, as well as motivations, may have been accelerated by considerations reflecting the new economic reality amid the pandemic,“ said Jan Bubeník, founder and managing partner of Bubenik Partners.\n\nMarek Petruš, Director of Research & Knowledge Management at Bubenik Partners, said the third quarter confirmed the trend that one generation of seasoned Czech managers had been returning from foreign engagements, usually in the world’s largest corporations. Those returns accounted for four out of the „Top 10“ managerial changes in the past quarter.\n\nThe third quarter also highlighted two other trends perceived this year: First, e-commerce – and especially the ultra-dynamic online retail industry – keep attracting top talent. The rapidly expanding online supermarket Rohlík thus gained valuable reinforcement for its top management by hiring Petr Pavlík, who had previously worked in the country’s management of the Albert chain. Secondly, companies value the contribution of women in leadership positions – a new woman, Veronika Brázdilová, will take a seat among the men in Vodafone’s top management.\n\nTop Ten Management Changes in the Third Quarter of 2020 According to Bubenik Partners\n\n(in alphabetical order)\n\nVeronika Brázdilová – Director Commercial Operations at Vodafone Czech Republic (previously worked six years in the role of General Manager for the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary in Xerox)\n\nRoman Cabálek – General Manager for the Czech Republic at Dell Technologies (returning to the executive position after a five-year engagement as an independent mentor, coach and management consultant; until 2014, he had worked 15 years for Microsoft, the last three as General Manager for the Czech subsidiary)\n\nPavel Čejka – Chairman of the Board at Raiffeisen Building Society (before that, held the position of COO and member of the top management for international services at Société Générale and prior to that he had been a member of the board and CFO of the Komerční banka)\n\nJiří Jaroš – General Manager of the new Glass for Architecture Division at Lasvit (previously spent a year in Hong Kong as Deputy Regional Executive Manager for Asian countries at consumer finance group Home Credit International)\n\nPetr Pavlík – CEO for the Czech business of the online supermarket Rohlík (prior to joining the company worked four years in the top management of the supermarket chain Albert; before that he led distillery Stock Plzeň-Božkov)\n\nJakub Puchalský – Member of the Prague Airport Board responsible for aviation and non-aviation business, corporate and marketing communication departments (steps up to the Board from the position of Non-Aviation Business Department Executive Director)\n\nThomas Schäfer – Chairman of the Board at Škoda Auto (previously served as Chairman and Managing Director of Volkswagen Group South Africa, responsible for the development of the Group brands in the sub-Saharan Africa region)\n\nMartin Škop – CEO at Cetin a.s. (in his last role served as the executive VP for infrastructure development for the Russian operator Beeline and also held a position of Chairman of the Board of the Russian infrastructure company NTC)\n\nMilan Vašina – Executive Director of Aspen Institute Central Europe (takes on the role after spending most of his professional career in telecommunications; between 2011-2018 he served as CEO at T-Mobile Czech Republic)\n\nJan Záhumenský – CFO for Central Europe Mars (previously held the position of CFO of the Austrian branch of Mars Multisales; in the new role he will be responsible for financial management in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania)\n\nThe Movers and Shakers at the Top of Czech Business in the Third Quarter of 2020\n\nThe 10 most significant managerial changes in the Czech Republic in the third quarter of 2020 included leadership change at the country’s largest company, change at the domestic branch of a giant computer manufacturer, as well as returns of Czech managers from their foreign engagements – to take the lead of a building society, the operator of the largest telecommunications network, or the new division of a globally operating glass company.\n\nAmong other notable changes, according to Bubenik Partners, was the rotation of two women in the leadership position with a mobile operator and the introduction of new faces to the management of Prague Airport, a regional think tank and an expanding online supermarket.
