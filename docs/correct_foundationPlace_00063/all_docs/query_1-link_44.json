        "text": "You will be surprised that you can choose to study one of over 70 programs at Ivy Tech. And the best part? They are all very focused on a career goal, so you know what your outcome will be. Some of the most popular or surprising areas of study are:\n\nNursing\n\nSmart Manufacturing & Digital Integration\n\nBusiness Administration\n\nCybersecurity\n\nEngineering\n\nAgriculture\n\nDepending on the program you choose, you will earn a certain type of degree or credential. Two-year associate degrees give you the skills and knowledge you need to start a career in a field where workers are in high demand. Your two-year degree can also have you halfway to your bachelor’s degree at a four-year college you transfer to. Certificates and workforce certifications, on the other hand, are shorter-term options. Some of them can be completed in less than a year, providing you with an industry-recognized credential quickly.\n\nNot all programs are offered at each of our locations, so you will want to make note if it’s available near you. Our website gives you many details about each program, including the various degrees and certificates available, what types of jobs you would be qualified for, and even your potential income.\n\nNeed help determining what program is best for you? Call us at 1-888-IVY-LINE (1-888-489-5463) from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily or email the Admissions Office at the location most convenient to you.\n\nGetting Started\n\nYour first step to starting your Ivy Tech education is to apply for admission—with no application fee. And we’ve made that as simple as possible! If you have never applied before or it’s been two years since you last applied, you will start by clicking here. This page describes the process and tells you what you might want to later upload for your assessment. From there, you will click the “Apply Now for Free” button. It’s an easy process!\n\nTiming\n\nIvy Tech does not require applications by certain dates. Instead, we offer five opportunities to start classes in January, March, June, August and October. You can start whichever time works best in your life. Your application will take about 7-10 business days to process, after which you will receive an acceptance letter in the mail. If you do not hear back from us in that timeframe, call Admissions at 888-IVY-LINE (1-888-489-5463) for information.\n\nOnline Application\n\nWe accept online applications. If this won’t work for you, you will need to visit your local campus.\n\nHow to Become an Ivy Tech Student\n\nOnce you receive your acceptance letter, you will get instructions on what to do next. Below is a list of steps you will take to become and Ivy Tech student.\n\nYour first step will be to set up your MyIvy Account, which you’ll use all the time for student information.\n\nMeet with an Enrollment Specialist at your campus (find local campus contact info here).\n\nFile your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n\nSubmit your transcripts if you recently finished high school or college courses.\n\nCheck to see if you need to take a Knowledge Assessment.\n\nMeet with your Career Coach.\n\nMeet with your Advisor.\n\nRegister for classes.\n\nPay for classes and/or set up a payment plan.\n\nGetting Started Checklist\n\nIf you like to check off items on a list, you can download a handy checklist here that outlines the steps to completing enrollment and class registration and becoming an Ivy Tech student.\n\nTuesdays@The Tech\n\nIf this all feels a bit overwhelming, don’t worry, we’re here to help. Take advantage of Tuesdays@TheTech by stopping by your local campus on any Tuesday to get personal support and guidance to complete your registration.\n\nYou will not be alone as you take your Ivy Tech journey. Instead, you’ll be guided by your Advisor, who will meet with you to build your Academic Completion Plan. This will include determining which classes to take each semester. If you’re planning to transfer to a four-year university after finishing your Ivy Tech degree or certificate, that will drive your plan.\n\nFinding Your Advisor\n\nYou will work directly with an advisor at your location. You will start by logging into MyIvy, scroll to the QUICKLINKS section, and then click Schedule Appointment with Advisor. You can use this appointment scheduling guide for step-by-step instructions. The Advising Checklist on page 2 of this document will give you a good idea of what to expect and how to be best prepared for your meeting.\n\nWorrying about how you’ll pay your tuition should never keep you away from improving your career options with an Ivy Tech education. There are many types of financial aid available to our students, and we want you to find the best fit for your situation. Getting financial aid can help you pay for college now and finish with little or no debt or a more manageable payment plan.\n\nFinancial Aid Options\n\nIvy Tech offers students many ways to find aid that doesn’t have to be paid back. This gift aid includes grants, scholarships, and work study programs.\n\nGrants - A grant is tuition money given to students based on financial need.\n\nScholarships - Ivy Tech offers hundreds of scholarships worth more than $7 million. Scholarships are based on a number of factors, including financial need and/or academic achievement. Many of the scholarships are tied to a certain campus. You must complete the FAFSA and fill out just one scholarship application per year.\n\nWork Study Programs - You have both federal and state work study programs to consider as a way to help pay for your education. These require you to work a certain number of hours per week.\n\nLoans - This is money that you borrow from a bank, credit union, or other organization that you are required to pay back once you’re done with school. The payment you make back will be the amount loaned plus interest that is charged over the course of the loan.\n\nStarting with the FAFSA\n\nThe FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is the starting point for all financial aid opportunities, and you must fill it out every year. It’s actually easier to fill out than you might think. This page will help you know what information to gather and the steps to take when filling out the form.\n\nTo register for classes, you must already be accepted to Ivy Tech. It's a good idea to meet with your Advisor before registering. You can find the courses that best fit your life with our schedule builder, a tool in the MyIvy student portal that lets you easily search for the class you want. When you’re ready, you can get started here on registering for classes. If you have questions about the process, you can find lots of answers here.\n\nYou can also take advantage of Tuesdays@TheTech by stopping by your local campus on any Tuesday to get personal support and guidance to complete your registration.\n\nPut most simply, MyIvy is your student portal for email, course registration, grades, transcripts, online payments, class communication, college events, and other student services. The first time you go to MyIvy, just click on “First Time User” to start the process (see the complete steps here).\n\nIvyLearn is the student portal to access your course information, syllabus, and online coursework. Learn more here about getting started with IvyLearn before your first class. You’ll find both portals will make your Ivy Tech experience easy to navigate.\n\nAs you know, the schedule builder in MyIvy is our tool that lets you easily search for the classes you want. The schedule builder provides you with dates and times of each course, instructor information, and the course description so you have everything you need to make your semester schedule.\n\nWhen you’re ready to register for classes, it's a good idea to schedule a meeting with your Advisor. Your advisor will make sure your academic plan is on track.\n\nYou can also take advantage of Tuesdays@TheTech by stopping by your local campus on any Tuesday to get personal support and guidance to complete your registration.\n\nRemember that you will need to fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) each year, as well as the scholarship application. Then you can keep track of your financial aid in MyIvy. Your financial aid might include grants, scholarships, loans, and/or work study. If you cannot make just one payment for your tuition, you can set up a payment plan in MyIvy.\n\nSee important dates and deadlines for:\n\nRefunds\n\nPayment plans\n\nFAFSA\n\nYour transcript includes information about your attendance at Ivy Tech. It includes your current program of study, any degrees awarded by Ivy Tech, transfer credit and term-by-term course, and grade and GPA information.\n\nYou can request your transcript in MyIvy. Once you log in, just select Browse Topics at the top of the page, select Academics & Advising from the drop-down menu, and then select Request Official Transcripts. If you prefer, you can request your transcript by visiting your local Express Enrollment Center or Registrar’s Office. You can request mailed or electronic transcripts. The fee for official transcripts is $5 per copy."
