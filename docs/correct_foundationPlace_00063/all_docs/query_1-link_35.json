        "text": "AVG and Star Tech have partnered to offer students in university accommodation a 90-day free trial of anti-virus software.\n\nStar-Tech is an Australian ISP for the university accommodation sector, with 17 live residential sites across the country.\n\nLloyd Borrett, marketing manager at AVG, told CRN it was important to international students who use the internet as a lifeline between home and Australia to manage their finances.\n\nHe said the relationship with Star-Tech was one of the first with an organisation targeting the education market.\n\nAVG approached the ISP about the deal and it took three months to bring it to market, said Borrett.\n\nMost AVG resellers have \"reacted positively\" to the partnership, he said.\n\n\"Similar partnerships in the past have resulted in an increase in reseller sales as the AVG brand becomes more trusted by users,\" said Borrett.\n\n\"This seemed counter-intuitive and traditional thinking is that AVG Free would work against resellers.\n\n\"In practice it works for AVG resellers and being counterintuitive is the foundation stone of AVG.\""
