        "text": "AFCSLS\n\nAmerican foundation supporting talented and motivated Czech and Slovak students from the first grade to high school graduation.\n\nSome History\n\nAFCSLS is a successor to the American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees (AFCR), founded in 1948. AFCR helped thousands escape Communism and settle in the United States. The founders included Dr. Ján Papánek, the first Czechoslovak Ambassador to the United Nations, First Lady Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, and many other prominent personalities who refused to accept Communist rule and fought it from the United States. AFCSLS is a member of the Bohemian Benevolent and Literary Association (BBLA).\n\nCTM expertise stems from a long-term association with the Center for Talented Youth (CTY), Johns Hopkins University. In 2010, AFCSLS and CTY launched a pilot program in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. AFCSLS has invested more than one million dollars, mainly for scholarships, the training of instructors, and technical support. CTY agreed to qualify students for the program based on recommendations from participating schools, reduce course fees, provide technical support, and train instructors. CTM evolved from the pilot program.\n\nAFCSLS Members\n\nAFCSLS members come from the United States, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
