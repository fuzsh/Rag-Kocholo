As the documentation explains for round():\n\nThe return value has the same type as the first argument (assuming that it is integer, double, or decimal)\n\nThat means that what gets displayed in an application might still show more (or fewer) than the number of decimal places. By changing the type, the application will know how many decimal places should be in the result."
