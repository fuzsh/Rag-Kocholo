        "text": "Hi,\n\nLooking for a suitable antivirus 3 years ago i registered with AVG. I realized that it wasn't any good because it slowed my CPU quite significantly so i unregistered with AVG and thought no more of it. Anyway since then Paypal have continued to debit my account saying that this action IS authorized.\n\nI cannot access my old log in details with AVG so i am debited Â£45 every year with Paypals consent even though i have asked for a refund. Apparently its a pre approved payment even though i DONT approve of this continual theft of my limited finances.\n\nI am now broke this week with Paypals approval WTF?\n\nIt seems i cannot even find a human to speak too because the phone number isnt even working.\n\nHas Paypal gone rogue?\n\nWell im obviously still Â£45 down regardless of whether i didnt untick the correct box on the auto payment system which ive now done.\n\nIve asked for a refund which has been refused. AVG have had a total of Â£120 over a period of 3 years for a service that im not even using. Why wont Paypal help me resolve this problem and give me a refund?\n\n@Steelbeard\n\nNo, PayPal has not gone rogue. When you sign up for these online services, you set up a billing agreement when you first subscribe allowing PayPal to deduct the cost of the subscription. There might be a certain why you have to cancel with the service provider AND, you can also cancel the billing agreement at PayPal.\n\nService providers and certain merchants set up billing agreements and automatic payments to streamline checkout experience and automate payments for your convenience but sometimes we forget or don't cancel properly according to provider procedure.\n\nYou can cancel the billing agreement at PayPal (if not at the merchant's site) by:\n\nPersonal accounts:\n\nGo to Settings (gear icon) > Payments > Manage Automatic Payments\n\nSelect merchant on left, click Cancel on the right.\n\nBusiness accounts:\n\nGo to Account Settings (gear icon) > Money, banks and cards > Automatic payments > Set Automatic Payments\n\nClick Merchant from list and edit payment method or cancel on the next page.\n\nKudos & Solved are greatly appreciated. ğŸ™‚"
