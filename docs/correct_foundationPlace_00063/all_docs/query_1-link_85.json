        "text": "If you don't need your OneAgent to run in the full-stack monitoring mode, you can also use one of the two lightweight modes that provide you with the subset of OneAgent metrics, focusing on your host infrastructure:\n\nThe table below shows an overview of available monitoring options for each of the monitoring modes.\n\nFor more information on Infrastructure Monitoring and Discovery modes for Application Security, see Application Security and monitoring modes\n\nDiscovery mode\n\nOneAgent version 1.281+\n\nOneAgent Discovery mode provides basic metrics enabling you to discover your hosts and processes and learn the potential to extend your monitoring.\n\nWe recommend that you deploy OneAgent in Full-Stack Monitoring mode to monitor your business-critical applications. Similarly, we recommend that you monitor critical infrastructure, like databases, queues, and messaging systems with Infrastructure Monitoring. OneAgent in Discovery mode can be deployed across the remainder of your infrastructure for full visibility thanks to its relatively low cost.\n\nDiscovery mode is available only if you're using the Dynatrace Platform Subscription model. License consumption is via the Foundation & Discovery capability. To learn more, see Host monitoring.\n\nThe following built-in metrics are available in Discovery mode:\n\nCPU\n\nMemory\n\nAvailability\n\nDisk\n\nNetwork\n\nEnable Discovery mode\n\nYou enable Discovery mode at the host level, either during or after OneAgent installation.\n\nCode-module injection\n\nFor Application Security to work in Discovery mode, code-module injection is required. Code-module injection is disabled by default.\n\nAfter enabling Discovery mode, you can enable the code-module injection for a single host.\n\nFor details on how Application Security works in Discovery mode, see Application Security: Discovery mode.\n\nInfrastructure Monitoring mode\n\nWhile Full-Stack mode provides complete application performance monitoring, code-level visibility, deep process monitoring, and Infrastructure Monitoring (including PaaS platforms) for use cases where less visibility is required, OneAgent can be configured for Infrastructure Monitoring mode, which provides physical and virtual infrastructure-centric monitoring, along with log monitoring and AIOps.\n\nEnable Infrastructure Monitoring mode\n\nYou enable Infrastructure Monitoring mode at the host level, either during or after OneAgent installation.\n\nProcess injection\n\nProcess injection provides you with additional data for Infrastructure Monitoring. Process injection is enabled by default.\n\nInfrastructure Monitoring mode enables you to monitor any infrastructure component and backing service written in Java. You can monitor backing services supported by default (for example, Kafka or ActiveMQ), and you can also build your own custom JMX and PMI extensions for infrastructure components and use them in Infrastructure Monitoring mode.\n\nAdditionally, with process injection, Infrastructure Monitoring mode provides runtime metrics for:\n\nDisable process auto-injection\n\nWe don't recommend disabling auto-injection, but if you're required to do so due to strict security requirements, you can choose among a variety options. Note that disabling auto-injection also prevents Dynatrace from discovering vulnerabilities in your environment, even if you have Application Security enabled. You can disable automatic injection at the host or environment level.\n\nDisable auto-injection for a single host\n\nDisable auto-injection for an environment\n\nFilter hosts by injection status\n\nWhen you disable auto-injection, you can find such hosts using the Auto-injection filter on the Deployment Status page or OneAgent on a host API.\n\nVirtualization monitoring\n\nDynatrace supports virtualization monitoring. To monitor the virtual components in your environment, you need to complete an extra step beyond initial setup. For full details, see Set up virtualization monitoring.\n\nFrequently asked questions"
