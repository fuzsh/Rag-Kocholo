An entrepreneur himself, who has founded and run several mobile-oriented start-ups in this market, Tayeb also previously served as Vice-President of Conduit's Mobile Business Unit, and headed up its spin-off, Como, prior to becoming a start-ups advisor.\n\nAbout AVG Technologies (NYSE: AVG)\n\nAVG is the online security company providing leading software and services to secure devices, data and people.
