What's more, the prices are highly attractive for local government departments like ours.¡¨\n\nGilles Guilhem, IT manager, Creil City Hall\n\n¡§I know next to nothing about computers but I managed to install AVG by myself - it's really very simple. As I wanted to be sure I'd done everything right, I contacted the AVG Helpline. They were ready to listen and most charming and confirmed that the product was correctly installed. I now feel totally protected and I know that if I need anything I can rely on them to help.¡¨\n\nRoland Delvaux, Pensioner\n\n¡§Since I installed AVG Anti-Virus, it's as if my PC has grown wings because it uses hardly any resources ¡V a great change from the antivirus product I had before! AVG updates itself automatically each time I switch on my computer and it's reassuring to know that it takes care of everything.
