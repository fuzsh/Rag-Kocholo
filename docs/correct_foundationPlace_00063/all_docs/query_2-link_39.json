        "text": "Sometimes itâs not easy to find the words you want to say about something that you find unique. This app I find is one of those times today the Technology changes so fast that itâs hard for software to keep up with the Technology changes that transpires in seconds minutes and every moment of the day! I thank the Developer for keeping up with those changes that keep you myself and our family safe. Itâs easy for me to say this perhaps being I donât have to program the software! It takes a great deal of time hard work and a lot of Headaches! The Developer of this app does this for you myself and our family! How do you know? Look at the number of updates that are being made! Then look at the aspect that this app really does protect all of us! Yes Technically as you read this things are changing the people who invented the words Scam Fraud and Hackers are out there trying to get to us! I thank the Developer for all His Hard work in stopping that from happening! I hope if you took the time to read this you will Download and truly try this app! What do you have to loose if you donât? Maybe a lot more than the price of this app!!!! Thanks again to the Developer for His,or Her hard work I truly tip my Hat to you. Thanks\n\nAVG has been something I chose over any other antivirus. Whether I pay or not there's still something valuable to use to protect my phone and computer or any other device.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable app, AVG is the way to go. A lot of the others are very annoying to deal with with all the notifications and forced scans and sometimes crashing apps due to other apps. But AVG delivers everything I expect in a security app and helps give me peace of mind without any annoying hassle.\n\nItâs good, it scans the websites you have visited and more but it doesnât provide a lot of information about the websites, malware, and how the antivirus is working. I have not seen a virus nor a malware pop up for AVG. (This is maybe because I have not went to many sketchy websites or advertisements recently or itâs because of the quality of the antivirus) I have seen thousands of my browsing history and websites I have visited. It probably does not catch strong viruses/malware or a lot of them. I have heard this is a decent antivirus app. My phone was really slow once I kept it on for a whole day. I thought this was a good VPN and antivirus app. After, I just Immediately deleted the app and the VPN. I would say this is a decent app but it doesnât provide much security and protection towards viruses or malware. Itâs considered a bit of a weak and decent antivirus app. If youâre looking for free, decent ones like these, you should use this app then. Itâs not my type of app, here is a disclaimer that this antivirus app also provides a VPN for users who use the app. If you have another VPN like me, this is not for you so keep the VPN you already have."
