        "text": "RAW IT\n\n\"The new AVG 7.5 has performed fantastically against all manner of malicious attempts to fry my OS. I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking of connecting their computer to the internet. It's easy to use and a breeze to order. And with the Anti-spyware and AntiVirus rolled into one it's quicker running scans and updates.\"\n\nRussell Luck, Owner\n\n\"I particularly like the email scanner. Automatically all incoming and outgoing emails and their attachments are scanned, with a small window showing precisely what is happening. For example, with download I get a threefold unobtrusive real time report in a small window thus: download percentage progress, scanning process, and transfer to my email program process. For unobtrusiveness yet informativeness, it is superb. I think your program is brilliant, easy to understand, and it automatically updates at 9 a.m. daily. Your pricing is extremely reasonable, and I have no intention of going elsewhere, and I will be renewing at the beginning of January 2007.\"\n\nAllan Lane, Perth, Western Australia\n\n\"I am a very satisfied AVG Professional user. AVG Pro saves me about 5 or 6 times a day, by eliminating viruses, Trojans, worms and down-loaders. In my experience the competitor‘s products all let some problems slip through. Then they multiply and before you know it you have a dead machine – or worse – with possible identity theft and possible financial loss through cleaned out bank accounts or credit card accounts being among the more severe of the consequences.\"\n\nAllan Baker, Australia\n\n\"Thank you for such a great product. Finally I have a virus checker that's fantastic. My family will change and when I finish with my mates they too will be using your product.\"\n\nChris Phantom, Australia\n\n\"The trial version installed and worked very well. In fact it found and dealt with ten, yes ten!, viruses that were infecting my computer and which my previous virus protection (Hah! that should be \"no protection\") software had completely missed. Thanks for the great service. I'm impressed.\"\n\nBill Dixon, Australia\n\n\"With AVG, I have finally reached the pinnacle of my search for the \"program for the total protection and ease of use\" for protecting my computer and keeping out all the unwanted nasties on the internet. At the end of my trial I will be purchasing AVG, such is my total faith in this product, its ease of use and support services, not to mention the quality, timely and super quick signature updates… I‘m definitely sold!!\"\n\nDavid Venn\n\n\"AVG is much more than anti virus software. It is an integral system fitting seamlessly into the operation and performance of computer management.\"\n\nDRoger Jeakings, New Zealand\n\nCreil City Hall\n\nThe Creil City Hall (network of 500 computers) is handling more than 30,000 citizens. \"We quickly realized how effective the AVG engine was when it detected and deleted a virus that had been lying dormant in our IT system for several months. We were wone over not simply by the technical aspects of the AVG product, but also byt the quality of the contact we had with Square employees who are dynamic, respond quickly, listen to what we have to say and take our comments seriously when updating and developing solution. What's more, the prices are highly attractive for local government departments like ours.\"\n\nGilles Guilhem, IT Manager, Creil City Hall\n\n\"I know next to nothing about computers but I managed to install AVG by myself - it's really very simple. As I wanted to be sure I'd done everything right, I contacted the AVG Helpline. They were ready to listen and most charming and confirmed that the product was correctly installed. I now feel totally protected adn know that if I need anything I can rely on the to help.\"\n\nRoland Delvaux, Pensioner\n\n\"Since I installed AVG AntiVirus, it's as if my PC has grown wings because it uses hardly any resources - a great change from the antivirus product I had before! AVG updates itself automatically each time I switch on my computer and it's reassuring to know that it takes care of everything. I've got important patient files on my PC and I need to know they're absolutely safe. So far, AVG has blocked all the viruses that tried to infect my data.\"\n\nFrançois Jullian, Doctor"
