        "text": "We use the AVG business console for antivirus and Internet security and patching. It usually works very well. I am the only person in my organization that has a login.\n\nSometime in December 2023, I had 2 servers have their profiles changed from the Server group to DEFAULT. This profile change caused the servers in question to be exposed to brute force attacks for several days before I discovered the problem because they no longer had the firewall configs applied to them.\n\nThe same thing happened to my workstation I use for admin purposes. I contacted AVG about it. The response was that someone at my company must have made the change. The change is not in the audit log, BUT there are some entries in the audit log with my login info and it shows the originating IP address as 10.200.xxx.xxx. This is a private address.\n\nMy other changes show up properly in the audit log with my actual Internet IP address. I canâ€™t seem to convince them that anything with a 10. address must have originated on their network. Or their audit logging is faulty.\n\nI would think they would care a little more about something like this."
