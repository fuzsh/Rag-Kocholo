Applications are now closed.\n\nCommonly Asked Questions:\n\nQualifications & Eligibility:\n\nDue to grant restrictions, this AVG Apprenticeship is limited to current California residents, ages 18-24 or veterans, who are authorized to work in the US. If you are a current California resident, but are not in the Los Angeles/Southern California region, you will be limited to virtual on-the-job placement options.\n\nWe plan on expanding in future years, so please stay tuned for more information.\n\nThis is not a dealbreaker. If you’re selected as an Apprentice, BRIC can help support your local transportation needs, such as providing LA metro passes.\n\nNo, you do not need to be a student for this program. The Apprenticeship is open to any level of education as long as you meet our listed eligibility requirements.\n\nA key component of Apprenticeship is on-the-job placement and training with a studio employer, so it will be difficult to be a full-time employee elsewhere or a full-time student while this takes place. Depending on the studio, Apprentices generally work the same hours as full-time studio employees, up to 39 hours per week.\n\nThat said, we encourage you to still apply if you are graduating soon. Some students who only have part-time classes on certain days may still be able to work with an employer, but this will require a high level of self-discipline to succeed.\n\nApplications & Portfolio:\n\nYes, but be sure that your application and portfolio are tailored to each specific track that you’re applying for.\n\nThis is the main component that reviewers will be looking at. Be sure to tell us about your background and the moment that made you realize your interest in your chosen field. This is an opportunity to tell us your story and about you as an artist. Where does your creative vision come from? What inspires you? What are your goals?\n\nPlease do not spend too much time on your video submission. The video submission is offered as an optional alternative to traditional application methods like a written cover letter. Think of it as alternate option for reviewers to get to know you!\n\nOverall, portfolio sites should not distract from the portfolio itself. Public sites built on Wix or Squarespace, or dedicated art galleries like ArtStation or Instagram, are all acceptable methods! However, we recommend against using Google Drive to display your portfolio as there’s a higher chance of reviewers encountering access issues.\n\nAbout the Program:\n\nThis is a 12-month program that includes RSI (144 hours of related supplemental instruction) and an on-the-job placement. We are using a competency-based model, so apprenticeship timespans are dependent upon employer assessment of growth with a minimum timespan of 6+ months.\n\nYour RSI (144 hours of related supplemental instruction) can be virtual, in-person, or hybrid. Many on-the-job placements are virtual but some may require you to be hybrid or in-person in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSince we have many employers with different needs, hours are going to be based on what position you’re going for, and which employer you match with. It will be up to 39 hours a week during the placement.\n\nAt the time of this FAQ’s writing (October 16, 2023) in Southern California it is a minimum of $18.78/hr. Halfway through the Apprenticeship, BRIC will conduct a competency assessment and if you’ve met half of your competency requirements, it will trigger a $1/hr raise. Once all competencies are completed, it triggers another $1/hr raise.\n\nActual rates will vary depending on the partner studio. Things such as union agreements or internal policies may impact final pay rates.\n\nSince studios assess their talent needs on an ongoing basis, we unfortunately aren’t able to provide a list of which studios will be sponsoring which positions in advance.\n\nIf selected, most Apprentices are matched with one employer at a time. However some Apprentices may be matched with multiple employers and will be lucky enough to choose in that case.\n\nBecause we are assessing talent needs with studios on an ongoing basis, you may not hear from BRIC until an open studio position aligns with your application. This may take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. When an employer talent request aligns with an application, BRIC will reach out to you with the position details, answer any questions, and help prepare you for the interview process. You will interview with the employer, and if selected, BRIC will reach out to coordinate onboarding."
