        "text": "AMSTERDAM and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- AVG Technologies N.V. (NYSE: AVG), the online security company™ for 182 million active users, today announced its Digital Citizenship Program as its Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action. AVG's \"Smart User\" mission is to increase the ratio of smart users to smart phones by teaching the next two billion digital citizens skills how to engage in the digital world safely and securely in a way that protects them and others.\n\nWith the \"Smart User\" program, users will be educated through entertaining and engaging applications that are launched when devices are first activated and connected to the internet. This new \"Smart Users Smart Phones\" app will educate new users how to protect their privacy and security while safely engaging online.\n\n\"Today's digital world is filled with unprecedented promise and opportunity. With four billion people globally who are not connected to the Internet, there is an opportunity for economic development that can be maximized with education,\" said Harvey Anderson, Chief Legal Officer of AVG Technologies. \"The opportunity can only be fully realized when smartphone users know their rights and responsibilities. Users are rarely empowered with the information necessary to navigate the online world at the right time. Once users are prepared for their online journey, the opportunity to participate, produce, and create wealth are limitless.\"\n\nAccess to the digital highway requires nothing more than a phone. Unfortunately there are no \"rules of the road\" to accompany this open access. There is a solution in a growing global Digital Citizenship movement. AVG is proud to announce its participation in the movement with our Smart Users Smart Phone app. Increasing the percentage of educated users will benefit children, families, and the broader online community.\n\nAnderson will attend the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting September 21-24 in New York City. You can find more information on AVG's Commitment to Action here.\n\nAbout AVG Technologies (NYSE: AVG)\n\nAVG is the online security company providing leading software and services to secure devices, data and people.
