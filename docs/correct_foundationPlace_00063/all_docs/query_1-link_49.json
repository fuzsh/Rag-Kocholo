Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.\"\n\nAVG has withdrawn the faulty update, but admits that customers who have already installed the software may have trouble getting their PC to start. The company claims only some machines running the 64-bit version of Windows 7 are affected by the bug.\n\nAVG's support forum suggests a number of workarounds, including booting affected PCs in Safe Mode and running a System Restore, before reinstalling AVG.\n\nPeople who can't get their PC to boot at all are advised to follow a rather more complex workaround, involving AVG's Rescue CD utility.\n\nThe company claims it will eventually \"release some tool to help in fixing the systems affected by this bug\"."
