        "text": "“I am a volunteer and community organizer of over 10 years, advocating for immigrant rights in Dallas. My time with the the North Texas Dream Team since 2012 has played a role in the organization’s work for over 10,000 DACA recipients in Dallas and throughout Texas. Through this work, I have empowered other Dreamers like me with the application and renewal process for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status, and served as the organization’s Press and Information Officer for two years. My advocacy for immigrants’ rights and dignity led me to the halls of Congress, the streets of Dallas, and features in several media outlets, including the Dallas Morning News, NPR, and Telemundo 39 Dallas.\n\n“Austin College’s comprehensive curriculum and leadership opportunities imparted me with the skills that allow me to bring value to my Fortune 500 clients. The emphasis on critical thinking, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary approach equipped me to tackle the challenges I come across. Additionally, real-world internships and projects honed my analytical skills, decision-making abilities, and leadership qualities, preparing me for the challenges in my profession. Altogether, Austin College did more than instill knowledge; it cultivated a lifelong learning mindset, enabling me to continually adapt and contribute effectively in my field.”\n\n\"As a pre-med student, Austin College encouraged me to pursue coursework outside of the sciences to build a broad learning foundation. I thrived in the close-knit mentorship community present amongst the professors and students at AC, and have worked hard to bring that same community to my professional medical school relationships. It was Austin College that taught me to embrace unique backgrounds, think outside of the box, and speak up for new ideas. It was Austin College that equipped me with the mindset of \"I bet I can do that\" that led me to where I am and who I am today.\"\n\nShelby graduated from The University of Texas Medical Branch as a Doctor of Medicine and began a five-year General Surgery Residency at Methodist Dallas Medical Center to become a General Surgeon.\n\nIn addition to my work at Kula Sports Performance, I am also the founder and CEO of a company called Misfits Lifestyle brand—built with a mission to improve body image around clothing. I have taken my passion for fitness and service as well as a calling to raise awareness for men’s mental health causes into creating unique fitness challenges aimed at bringing men and women together to create a space where people are comfortable and confident to share their stories. I am incredibly grateful for my time at AC for so many reasons—many of which I did not understand until I had left Sherman. I learned leadership from the Service Station, which has helped me in my current career. I credit my four years on the baseball team for learning teamwork and competitive drive—as well as learning to overcome adversity. I also believe my time in the business classes was incredibly crucial and led to having a leg up on my peers immediately after graduation. I am so grateful for all the experiences at AC, every experience and struggle has helped me in just my short time since leaving Sherman.\n\nDr. Alade graduated in 2010 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. He also earned myriad accolades for his prowess on the basketball court. He went on to earn a master’s degree in kinesiology from Texas A&M University, followed by a Ph.D. in school psychology from Texas Woman’s University. His doctoral dissertation examined cognitive flexibility in pediatric traumatic brain injury patients in response to a cognitive rehabilitation program over time. Dr. Alade has also earned a Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential, and his work at Cook Children’s Medical Center is focused on evaluating and treating the mental health of children."
