        "text": "How to move to the USA\n\nThe USA is an alluring destination for expats looking to start a new and exciting life abroad. Whether you settle in a laid-back sunshine state like Florida or California or opt for the big-city hustle and bustle of New York or Chicago, America is so vast and varied it's like having fifty countries to explore in one!\n\nAfter a decrease in immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic, expats are once again flocking to America. In 2022, 46 million foreign-born people made their home in the US â€” 1 million more than in 2021. Expats now make up 15.3% of the US population (source: World Population Review).\n\nFrom applying for a visa and finding a home to shipping to USA and settling into the community, our in-depth guide to moving to the States covers it all and more. So, why not get your American dream started today?\n\nEntrepreneurialism is encouraged:\n\nThanks to our new digital world, it's never been easier to become your own boss. But starting a business in America could be your chance to transform your side hustle into big bucks. The US has long emphasised innovation and individual enterprise, and there's an array of funding options for startups.\n\nThere's a state to suit everyone:\n\nLonging for the cultural vibrancy of New York or dreaming of Miami's eternal sunshine? Perhaps you would prefer the quiet life in a farming town in Wyoming or the sports adrenaline of Utah's snowy slopes? With so many diverse American states, cities and towns, you're sure to find your dream home.\n\nA nation built by immigrants:\n\n\"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\" - The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus.\n\nThe US is a country created by immigrants with a historically welcoming nature. You and your family can learn and grow among a melting pot of cultures. Plus, If you're looking to meet fellow expats to ease the transition, you won't have to look far.\n\nGo big or go home!:\n\nBig ambitions, big burgers, big cars, and really big skyscrapers. American culture doesn't skimp on size, and that includes the country's houses. On average, homes in the US are more spacious than in similarly developed countries, so finding a property with enough space for your family should be relatively easy.\n\nGun laws can be a culture shock:\n\nWhile gun laws vary between states, rules on firearm ownership are certainly more relaxed than most expats are used to in their home countries. Ease concerns about gun-related violence by thoroughly researching crime rates in the areas you're considering before moving.\n\nPotentially costly healthcare:\n\nMedical costs in the USA are one of the highest in the world. However, most Americans and expats pay a monthly (or fortnightly) premium for health insurance. The plus side of privatised healthcare is access to the best treatments and shorter waiting times.\n\nA large wealth gap:\n\nIn the States, there is a considerable gap between the wealthy and those living in poverty, which has led to social and economic tensions. While the country's GDP does keep rising, the minimum wage has remained static at $7.25 since 2009.\n\nExpensive higher education:\n\nDespite being home to some of the world's most prestigious universities, including Ivy League institutions like Harvard, Yale and Princeton, the price of higher education in the USA can be a financial burden on graduates for many years. The average cost is $36,436 per student per year, including materials and living expenses.\n\nUS visa processing time\n\nUS visa processing time and the required application steps depend on the country you currently reside in. If you are outside the US, you must undergo a medical exam. But, if you are already living there as a nonimmigrant, you will not.\n\nIf an American company wants to hire you, they will petition the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on your behalf. If approved, you can live in the US permanently and will receive a green card.\n\nIf you don't have an employer willing to sponsor you, you can ask a family member who is a US citizen to do so. They can petition for your stay by completing an I-130 form on your behalf. Priority is given to spouses, parents, and unmarried children under 21. If approved, you will then begin processing in your home country.\n\nHow to apply for a work visa in USA\n\nTo apply for a work visa in the USA, gather the required documents, complete form DS-160 online, schedule a visa interview, pay the fee, attend an interview, and await processing. For detailed guidance, visit the official U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website.\n\nThe essential documents you'll need to provide include:\n\nA valid passport with at least six months remaining\n\nBirth and marriage certificates\n\nEmployment information\n\nYour CV\n\nRemember to print the confirmation page, as you must present it during your interview.\n\nThe State Department's National Visa Center (NVC) will invite you to an interview once they have processed your application. Please note, depending on which type of visa you have applied for, your wait could be months or even years.\n\nBefore your interview, your local embassy will assign you tasks, including a medical exam for immunisations and fingerprints. During the interview, an embassy official will review your application and ask related questions.\n\nHow long is the Green Card process\n\nThe Green Card process takes anywhere between seven and thirty-three months to complete. Wait times depend on your application method, suitability, location of the processing office, demand, unforeseen delays and more.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for a Green Card?\n\nThe cost to apply for a Green Card depends on your application method and current processing stage. Some mandatory payments include petitions, applications, support, medical examinations and administration fees.\n\nPlease reference the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website for the latest information on fees and the application process.\n\nWhat is the Green Card Lottery?\n\nThe Green Card Lottery, officially known as the American Diversity Immigrant Visa program, hands out up to 55,000 permanent visas annually â€” but gaining one of these visas depends on luck! Millions apply, so the likelihood of winning is not favourable.\n\nTo qualify, you must live in a country with a low emigration rate to the US and have graduated high school or have specific work experience. Entry is free, but if you win, there will be a fee to pay in person at your US Embassy. The list of countries that cannot enter the green card lottery changes yearly based on current immigration levels.\n\nEmigrating to the USA: 10 best cities in America for expats\n\nThe United States is a massive country â€” the third largest in the world! Once your entry is approved, you can live anywhere from the paradise islands of Hawaii to the skier's haven of Alaska. It's no wonder so few Americans own a passport since they can freely roam around fifty unique states.\n\nSo, whether the most important thing to you is climate, crime, cost of living or taxation, we take a deep dive into the ten most popular cities for expats in the US.\n\nNew York City, New York\n\nThe Big Apple is full of large expat communities who have made the city their home for centuries. It's a global hub for finance, media and the arts and attracts a yearly influx of ambitious professionals from all over the world.\n\nWhile there have been significant decreases in crime rates in recent decades, some areas are safer than others, so do your research before moving. New York State is the 10th highest in the US for taxes, with rates ranging from 4% to 10.9%, depending on income, and the city also imposes a local income tax.\n\nPopulation: 8.74M\n\nForeign-born population: 36.3%\n\nAvg. annual household income: $111,583\n\nAvg. monthly rent (for a studio): $3,380\n\nAvg. house price: $736,314\n\nCost of living: 72.5% higher than the US average\n\nMain industries: finance, healthcare, tech and retail\n\nWarmest month: July (avg. high 29Â°C, avg. low 21Â°C)\n\nColdest month: January (avg. high 4Â°C, avg. low -2Â°C)\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nL.A. is famous for its entertainment industry, which attracts a variety of people from all over the globe, hoping to \"make it\". It's also home to thriving expat communities, such as Koreatown, Little Tokyo, and Little Armenia.\n\nLike most major cities, crime rates in Los Angeles differ across neighbourhoods. 2019 - 2022 saw an 11% increase in overall crime, with 60 reported incidents per 1000 residents. California has one of the highest state income tax rates in the United States, which varies from 1% to 12.3%, depending on income.\n\nPopulation: 3.9M\n\nForeign-born population: 36.2%\n\nAvg. annual household income: $106,931\n\nAvg. monthly rent (for a studio): $2,020\n\nAvg. house price: $923,739\n\nCost of living: 61.7% higher than the US average\n\nMain industries: entertainment, tech and tourism\n\nWarmest month: August (avg. high 29Â°C, avg. low 19Â°C)\n\nColdest month: January (avg. high 20Â°C, avg. low 9Â°C)\n\nRenting vs. buying a property in the US\n\nOnce you've decided on a city or town to move to, you'll need to determine whether buying or renting a home is best. Leasing a property in the States lets you acclimatise to your new surroundings without committing to a large purchase like a house. After all, you might have a change of heart and want to return to your home country or try a different area. Research local hotels and Airbnb rentals to find a temporary place to stay while house hunting.\n\nRenting property in America\n\nBefore arriving, research your chosen area. Consider prices, how long your work commute will be, schools, crime rates, parks and local amenities. Search online using popular letting sites such as Zillow, Avail, Apartments and Craigslist. But avoid closing on a home based on images and text alone, as there will likely be discoveries when you see it in person. Then, line up as many viewings as possible, leaving enough time to travel between appointments.\n\nAnother option is hiring a realtor who can use their extensive knowledge of the local area. It can be costly, but it's a welcome relief to have a helping hand on arrival. Once you've picked a suitable home for you and your family, there's usually a written application you can fill in online.\n\nBefore moving in, you must sign a lease (also known as a contract). Typically, leases last for a year and cover your responsibilities as a tenant, such as paying for utilities and whether or not you can have pets. It will also include your landlord's contact details and their duties, like repairing appliances. Read your lease carefully and ask for your own copy. Pay close attention to when your rent is due and how much the security deposit is.\n\nOnce you move in, set up utilities in your name, such as electricity, water, gas, internet, and cable. Websites like Powerswitch and Make the Switch can help you determine your cheapest options.\n\nBuying a house in the States\n\nStart by working out your budget to ensure you have enough to afford a mortgage. Then, check your credit score on sites like Experian or Credit Karma to determine your likelihood of being accepted. Such valuable resources can suggest adjustments to increase your credit score, improving the mortgage rates banks offer.\n\nNext, apply for a pre-approved mortgage at your bank or local credit union. Doing so gives you a clear idea of what you can afford and your interest rates. Then, search for a licensed real estate agent who can help you find properties within your budget, negotiate offers and guide you through the process.\n\nOnce you find a home you love and the seller accepts your offer, hire a professional to assess the property's condition and conduct a title search to ensure there are no ownership issues. If applying for a mortgage, you must make a downpayment (deposit) of 3% to 20% of the house price.\n\nBefore closing on a deal, you'll pay various fees, including a down payment, closing costs, and any other expenses associated with the purchase. So, ensure you have enough in the bank to cover these, too!\n\nHow to open a US bank account when emigrating to America\n\nTo open a US bank account, visit a few banks close to your new home, if they have brick-and-mortar locations, and do some online research. Popular national banks include JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank.\n\nChecking account: for everyday transactions such as buying groceries and paying bills. Services you can access with this type of account include ATM withdrawals, account transfers, and more.\n\nSavings account: for storing funds to use at a later date. These accounts have higher interest rates than checking accounts, so you can earn more on top of the money you've saved.\n\nYou'll need to provide identification such as proof of immigration (visa, green card, etc.), a valid passport and a Social Security number if you have one. Some US banks, such as HSBC and Barclays, operate worldwide. They can help you set up a US account if you already bank with them.\n\nA land of boundless opportunities: working and getting a job in the United States\n\nWith more than nine million vacancies across the US, it's no wonder it's considered one of the best countries to live and work. As an expat looking to settle in the US and get sponsorship from an employer, your best chance of securing a job is an in-demand role.\n\nAs long as you have finished high school, there are plenty of high-paying jobs for drivers, technicians, and, with a bit of experience, management roles. There's also good news for those with qualifications. As well as being more likely to receive sponsorship from a US employer, there is always demand for nurses, sales reps and general managers.\n\nStart by researching the US's biggest industries, such as healthcare, education and tourism, and searching for in-demand roles that fit your skills.\n\nHow to get a US Social Security number\n\nYou need a Social Security number (SSN) to secure a job in the US. If you have a working visa, you can apply for a Social Security card once you arrive in America by going to your local Social Security office â€” with 12,000 in the country, there's sure to be one nearby! Find the address of your closest office using the Social Security Office Locator.\n\nTake with you a completed SS-5-FS form and the following original documents:\n\nProof of birth (birth certificate)\n\nImmigration status (visa, green card or employer authorisation document)\n\nProof of identity (passport)\n\nProof of employment (contract offer or HR certificate)\n\nAn I-94 arrival record form\n\nTop tip: take your original documents plus photocopies to speed up the process.\n\nTips for job hunting in America\n\nStart by researching the US's biggest industries, such as healthcare, education and tourism, and searching for in-demand roles that fit your skills. Utilise job listing websites like Indeed and Monster and connect with potential employers on LinkedIn, a social media platform for professionals. Other job-hunting options include:\n\nAttending networking events and career fairs\n\nChecking your desired employer's website for vacancies\n\nRegistering with recruitment agencies\n\nCold emailing companies directly with your CV (it's called a resume in the States!)\n\nTo stand out from other candidates, tailor your CV to the American job market, write a well-crafted cover letter and highlight your achievements and relevant experience during interviews. Finally, finding employment in the United States requires persistence and resilience â€” keep searching and sending out applications, and you'll land your dream job in no time.\n\nHow to pick a healthcare insurance plan when emigrating to the States\n\nThere are several government programs to help those in lower-income families, including Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In the case of an emergency, hospitals will provide care regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. But, this can be costly if you don't have any form of insurance.\n\nChoosing the right insurance plan is an important decision that requires careful consideration. Here are some key questions to ask when looking for and deciding which US healthcare coverage to opt for:\n\nWhat medical services are covered by the plan, and are prescription drugs and preventative screenings included?\n\nDoes the plan cover mental health services and maternity care?\n\nHow are emergency services and hospital stays covered?\n\nHow easy is it to change doctors or specialists within the network?\n\nAre there waiting periods for specific treatments?\n\nWill your coverage still be valid if you move to a different state?\n\nUnderstanding American healthcare insurance can be a headache! If you need help finding the right one to suit your needs, budget, and preferences, consider consulting with a licenced healthcare broker, an agent who uses their in-depth knowledge of the system to provide personalised guidance.\n\nCar travel is widespread, especially in rural states such as Colorado, Maine and Mississippi, where there is less public transport.\n\nThe best ways to get around in the USA\n\nGetting from place to place in the US varies due to its vast size and the population of each state, city or town. Public transport options include buses and trains, and in some large urban areas, such as New York City and San Francisco, subways and trams.\n\nCar travel is widespread, especially in rural states such as Colorado, Maine and Mississippi, where there is less public transport. All major cities include airports with international connections and extensive motorways (highways) linking nearby regions.\n\nDepending on the state, you might be able to use the driver's license issued to you in your home country alongside an International Driving Permit for a period of time. However, at some point, you will need to apply for an American licence as a new driver â€” laws on the application process vary across the country, so thorough research is recommended.\n\n1. Statue of Liberty, New York\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is an instantly recognisable symbol of freedom and democracy. It was a gift from France to the United States on the 28th of October, 1886 and stands at a height of 93 metres from the base to the tip.\n\nLady Liberty holds a torch in her right hand and a tablet inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence on her left. She wears a flowing robe and a crown with seven spikes, representing the seven seas and continents of the world.\n\nTake a ferry across the Hudson River to Liberty Island to explore the statue's pedestal and museum, which includes exhibits on its history.\n\n2. The Grand Canyon, Arizona\n\nThe Grand Canyon is one of the world's most renowned geological wonders. Carved naturally by the Colorado River over millions of years, it spans 277 miles in length, over 1 mile deep, and varies in width from 4 to 18 miles.\n\nThe canyon's layered rock formations chronicle Earth's geological past over billions of years. Explore the natural spectacle through hiking trails and scenic overlooks, or embark on rafting expeditions along the Colorado River.\n\nThe Grand Canyon welcomes over five million people annually, making it one of the most visited national parks in the United States, and it can be explored by car, on foot or riding a pack mule!\n\nAnother benefit of using our international removals company is that we handle the customs process.\n\nWhat is the MoveCubeÂ® moving pod?\n\nYou can ship household goods using our secure moving pod, the MoveCubeÂ®.

However, there are a few things you should be aware of when shipping to the US:\n\nLike all countries, the States has a list of items banned from importation to protect its people and environment. Check our Prohibited Goods page before packing to avoid delays or fines.\n\nYou must be present in the United States when your household items arrive.\n\nComplete all online documents and ensure your inventory accurately matches what you have packed.\n\nUpload scans of the shipment owner's passport clearly showing the picture and signature pages.\n\nFor a full breakdown of the customs process in the US, including duty-free rules, read our Importing into the USA page.\n\nWhat is a 3299 form?\n\nA 3299 form helps the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) determine that the items you are importing comply with American customs laws and regulations. Similar to the UK's Transfer of Residence (ToR1) form, it's a legal requirement when shipping unaccompanied used personal goods not for resale that arrive at a different time than you. Or if you are moving to the US permanently. Typical goods include household furniture, clothing and sports equipment.\n\nIt's sometimes called the Declaration for Free Entry of Unaccompanied Articles.\n\nA CBP form 3299 is easier to complete than it might seem at first. There are seven sections, three of which you can leave blank:\n\nPart 1: the importer's basic information, including name, DOB, arrival date and their address in the States.\n\nPart 2: statement of eligibility for free entry of articles, indicating whether the imported goods are used or for sale.\n\nPart 3: for U.S. Army personnel and evacuees only, leave blank.\n\nPart 4: a detailed list of everything you're importing, describing all effects, including their respective value.\n\nPart 5: carrier's certificate and release order, leave blank.\n\nPart 6: certification for persons seeking free entry, put an \"X\" next to \"B\" as the importer.\n\nPart 7: CBP use only, leave blank.\n\nFailure to complete your CBP 3299 form accurately could lead to fines, delays, or even confiscation of your goods. Please visit the official U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for the most up-to-date information."
