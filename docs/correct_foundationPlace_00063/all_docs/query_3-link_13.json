        "text": "Employee work order request\n\nWork order tickets can be entered via an online form (log in using Active Directory credentials) or by email to webhelpdesk@caspercollege.edu.\n\nData Center Services\n\nThis team handles mission-critical back-end tasks including system administration, backup and recovery, and disaster recovery.\n\nSystem Administration Involves general system maintenance, updates and upgrades, system security, and performance monitoring.\n\nBackup and Recovery Ensures that critical data throughout the CC campus is safe and secure.\n\nDisaster Recovery Enables the restoration and reconstruction of crucial operational and business components.\n\nVirtualization By reducing the number of physical machines DoIT is able to conserve money, space and energy.\n\nFacilities A variety of equipment is utilized so that the campus’ main computer systems will remain functional.\n\nStorage CC applications, services and projects require large amounts of storage.\n\nSystem Administration\n\nThe Support and Operations department employs several System Administrators. This group of experienced individuals performs a multitude of duties including:\n\nSystem backup and restoration\n\nSoftware installation and updates\n\nHardware replacement and upgrades\n\nSystem performance monitoring\n\nDisaster recovery planning\n\nIn addition to the list above, the CC System Administrators participate in the creation and review of technical specifications for various campus projects.\n\nIn order to provide efficient and accurate services, our team continually participates in professional development. We strive to be pro-active in resolving any conflicts within our Data Center prior to suffering any “down time”. Our goal this year is to achieve 99.999% availability throughout our network of 80+ servers.\n\nBackup and Recovery\n\nTo ensure that important College data is not lost in cases of hardware failure or accidental deletion, vital data is backed up on a regular basis. The automated backup process occurs daily. Each backup is then reviewed to ensure that data was copied to the backup media before it is physically taken to a remote location. Up to eight weeks of backup data is maintained at any given time.\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\nDisaster Recovery preparation is a critical element within the Support and Operations department. The function of this group is to reconstruct the mission-critical operational and business components of CC at another location or at the existing location. Key CC personnel participate in a collaborative effort to ensure that vital functions of the University remain unaffected or can be restored.\n\nThe current CC Information Technology disaster recovery plan is available online for specific personnel who have been granted access to this information.\n\nVirtualization\n\nCC currently supports a Virtualization infrastructure allowing us to conserve money, space and energy by reducing the number of physical machines in our Datacenter.\n\nFacilities\n\nSupporting the College’s Datacenter is a Liebert UPS and diesel generator, which together ensure that the campus’ main computer systems will remain functional in the event the campus loses power from the City of Casper. To keep the Datacenter and equipment cool and at the appropriate humidity levels for our equipment, we operate redundant HVACs.\n\nStorage\n\nCC applications, services and projects require large amounts of storage. In addition to storage located internally on computer systems, CC manages a Storage Area Network (SAN).\n\nAntivirus\n\nA computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without permission or knowledge of the user. The term “virus” is also commonly used, albeit erroneously, to refer to many different types of malware and adware programs. Most computers are now connected to the Internet and to local area networks, facilitating the spread of malicious code. Today’s viruses may also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, email, Instant Messaging and file sharing systems to spread, blurring the line between viruses and worms. Furthermore, some sources use an alternative terminology in which a virus is any form of self-replicating malware."
