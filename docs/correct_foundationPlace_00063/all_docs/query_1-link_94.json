        "text": "AVG Secure is a newcomer to the VPN scene, backed by the well-known cybersecurity company AVG. With its affordable pricing and user-friendly interface, it seems like a promising option. But can it really compete with a long-standing industry leader like ExpressVPN?\n\nTo find out, we put both VPNs through a series of rigorous tests, evaluating every key aspect of their service. We compared their speeds, streaming performance, torrenting capabilities, server networks, security features, privacy policies, and more. I also took a close look at their apps to see which one offers a better user experience.\n\nWhile AVG Secure VPN put up a good fight in some areas, ExpressVPN consistently came out on top. It delivered much faster speeds, a larger server network, stronger privacy features, and a more polished user interface. Keep reading to discover how these two VPNs fared in each category.\n\nShort on Time? Here Are My Key Findings\n\nStreaming — ExpressVPN Offers More Reliable Access to Global Content\n\nExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN both claim to reliably access content from anywhere in good quality, but tests reveal a clear winner. My international team and I tested each VPN with the most popular local platforms. ExpressVPN consistently outperformed AVG Secure VPN in accessing a wide range of streaming platforms from around the world in HD or even UHD.\n\nWe put the VPNs through their paces with the Netflix libraries in each of our countries and found that ExpressVPN works seamlessly with not just the popular US, UK, and Japan regions but also less common libraries like South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil. My US teammates and I (based in the UK) reported that AVG Secure VPN could access Netflix in our regions. However, it failed to work with Netflix in South Korea and Brazil.\n\nExpressVPN's superior performance allowed it to work with every platform we tested. AVG Secure VPN, on the other hand, had mixed results. I successfully accessed BBC iPlayer from my location in the UK, but my US colleague said that it didn’t work with Max, Disney+, or Hulu. It also failed to securely access DAZN from anywhere, whereas ExpressVPN breezed right through.\n\nBoth VPNs will help you evade ISP throttling when streaming. When you use these VPNs, your internet traffic is encrypted. This means your ISP can't see what you're doing online, so they have no reason to slow down your connection.\n\nEditor’s note: The VPNs we recommend adhere to strict no-logs policies, meaning your online activities are never monitored or recorded. So it’s up to you to not participate in any illegal actitivies and follow the T&Cs of the platforms you use. The team at vpnMentor does not condone copyright infringement.\n\nServer Network — ExpressVPN Offers a Larger Server Network\n\nExpressVPN offers an extensive global server network, with 3,000 servers spread across 105 countries. This coverage ensures that you can always find a nearby server for optimal speed and reliability, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nIn contrast, AVG Secure VPN's server network is much more limited, with servers in only 50 countries. This smaller network means that you may not always find a server close to your physical location, which can impact connection speeds. Plus, it’s also possible that you won’t be able to find a connection in your desired location.\n\nDespite the difference in server count, I didn't encounter any issues with overcrowded servers during my tests with either VPN. However, ExpressVPN's larger network provides an extra layer of assurance, as it can better distribute user load across its many servers.\n\nThe biggest letdown for me is that AVG Secure VPN doesn't offer servers in many popular locations, such as India, Argentina, UAE, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. ExpressVPN has servers in all these countries and more, making it possible to access content from these regions.\n\nSpeed — Both VPNs Are Fast, With ExpressVPN Slightly Ahead\n\nI put both ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN through a series of speed tests to see how they perform in real-world scenarios. My base connection speed without any VPN was 236 Mbps. Both providers managed to maintain excellent speeds across various server locations.\n\nWhen I connected to a nearby UK server, I had a mere 2% speed drop with ExpressVPN. AVG Secure VPN couldn’t quite keep up, with a 14% drop in speed. This isn’t a huge drop, but it’s a bit much for a nearby server result.\n\nEven on distant US servers, ExpressVPN raced ahead. Its speed dropped by just 8%, which is remarkable considering the distance between the UK and the US. AVG Secure VPN lost 28% in speeds, which is much slower than ExpressVPN but isn’t the worst if you have a fast baseline connection.\n\nOn the Tokyo server, the speed difference between the two VPNs was much more noticeable. ExpressVPN caused a 33% speed reduction, while AVG Secure VPN slowed my connection by 54%. Considering all of this, ExpressVPN is clearly the better option to ensure you won’t be slowed down during your online activities — no matter where you connect.\n\nGaming — ExpressVPN Is a Better Choice for Gaming\n\nWhen you're in the heat of an intense online gaming session, the last thing you want is lag or high ping times ruining your streak. That's why I tested ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN to see which could deliver a smooth gaming experience.\n\nFirst, I checked my ping times without any VPN connected to set a baseline. My starting ping was a speedy 9ms — ideal for gaming.\n\nIn the UK server tests, both VPNs performed well. I barely noticed any difference compared to my non-VPN gameplay in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 2. Even in more demanding titles like Modern Warfare 3 and Monster Hunter Rise, both VPNs kept my hunts running smoothly.\n\nBut when I connected to servers in the US, ExpressVPN had the upper hand. With a ping of 78ms, I did notice a bit more input lag in fast-paced shooters like Destiny 2 and Apex Legends, but it was still very playable. With AVG Secure VPN's ping of 102ms, though, I found myself missing more shots and getting frustrated with laggy movement.\n\nOn Japanese servers, ExpressVPN's ping of 181ms meant I couldn’t use it for serious gaming sessions. But even here, it performed better than AVG Secure VPN's ping of 202ms.\n\nTorrenting — ExpressVPN Is Faster and More Private\n\nExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN allow P2P file sharing on all their servers. I tested both VPNs to find out which could deliver the best torrenting experience.\n\nI started by downloading a 5GB collection of copyright-free music from a popular torrent site. With ExpressVPN, the download was complete in just under 3 minutes, while AVG Secure VPN took around 3 minutes and 45 seconds. Both are impressive times, but ExpressVPN had the edge.\n\nAVG Secure VPN also offers dedicated P2P servers in 6 countries, which is a handy feature if you’re a frequent torrenter as it helps you easily find the right connection. However, in my tests, these didn't provide a noticeable speed boost compared to the regular servers.\n\nOf course, speed isn't everything when it comes to torrenting. You also want a VPN that will protect your privacy and keep your activity secure. We’ll delve into the details in the privacy section, but it's worth mentioning that ExpressVPN has a slight advantage in this area as well.\n\nNote that while torrenting is legal, downloading copyrighted files is not. We advise you to always check if the content you want to torrent is copyright-free or from the public domain to avoid accidentally breaking any laws. The team and I don't condone copyright infringement.\n\nSecurity — ExpressVPN Offers More Advanced Features\n\nExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN provide a strong foundation for VPN security. Both offer AES 256-bit encryption to protect your data, which is virtually uncrackable. You can trust that your online activities are secure with either VPN.\n\nBoth VPNs also offer leak protection to ensure your real IP address and DNS requests are never exposed. I put them through a series of leak tests, and neither one had any leaks. This means you can browse the web with confidence, knowing your identity is protected.\n\nAnother essential security feature is a kill switch, which both ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN include. This automatically disconnects you from the internet if your VPN connection drops, preventing any accidental exposure of your data.\n\nWhen it comes to VPN protocols, ExpressVPN offers Lightway and OpenVPN. Lightway is ExpressVPN's proprietary protocol designed to deliver fast speeds without compromising security. AVG Secure VPN, on the other hand, provides WireGuard, OpenVPN, and Mimic. Mimic is a unique protocol that allows you to use the VPN on restrictive networks.\n\nThat said, ExpressVPN offers some advanced features that AVG Secure VPN lacks. For instance, it offers split tunneling, which allows you to choose which apps use the VPN connection and which use your regular internet connection. This is useful if you want to access local content while still protecting your privacy for other activities.\n\nExpressVPN also includes a built-in tracker and malware blocker called Threat Manager and an ad blocker. These features can be found under Advanced Protection, and they block malicious ads and websites, providing an extra layer of protection against online threats. It's a nice addition that gives ExpressVPN an edge in terms of overall security.\n\nPrivacy — ExpressVPN Offers Better Privacy Protection\n\nBoth ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN have no-logs policies, meaning they don't collect data that can be used to identify you or your online activities. However, there are some notable differences in their privacy practices.\n\nExpressVPN's no-logs policy has been independently audited and verified by PwC and Cure53. The company is based in the British Virgin Islands, a jurisdiction that’s known for its strong privacy laws and is not part of the 5/9/14 Eyes agreement. It doesn't collect any personally identifiable information, and the data it does collect (such as server location and total amount of data transferred) cannot be used to identify individual users.\n\nAVG Secure VPN does collect some information that could potentially be used to identify users. This includes timestamps of when you connect to a VPN server and the amount of data used during each session. While AVG states that this data is only stored for 35 days and cannot be used to identify individual users, it still raises some privacy concerns.\n\nAdditionally, AVG Secure VPN is based in Czechia, a country that is subject to EU data retention laws. However, the implementation of these laws has been contentious, and Czechia does not currently have a comprehensive data retention law in force.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction, AVG's transparency reports reveal that it has shared user data with authorities in the past. In fact, Avast (AVG's parent company) has handed over data for 5 users in 2023 out of 51 government requests.\n\nExpressVPN also uses RAM-only servers, which wipe all data with every reboot, providing an extra layer of security. AVG Secure VPN does not currently utilize them.\n\nWorks in China — ExpressVPN Is More Reliable\n\nChina's Great Firewall is notorious for its strict internet censorship and restrictions on VPN usage. However, ExpressVPN's advanced obfuscation technology allows it to work in the country.\n\nExpressVPN's obfuscation feature is built into all of its servers and automatically kicks in when the app detects network restrictions. This means it’s possible to connect to any server and still enjoy secure access to the internet without having to manually enable any settings.\n\nAVG Secure VPN, on the other hand, does not offer any obfuscation features. As a result, it struggles to work in China and is not a reliable option.\n\nRemember that non-government-approvement VPNs are illegal in China. There haven't been any public records of a tourist getting fined for using one so far, but you should proceed with caution. The team and I don't condone using a VPN illegally.\n\nInstallation and Ease of Use — ExpressVPN Offers a Broader Range of Compatibility\n\nBoth ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN offer user-friendly apps for major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. The installation process is straightforward, and you can be up and running with either VPN in just a few minutes.\n\nThe apps for both VPNs are well-designed and easy to navigate. They organize servers by continent, making it simple to find a server in your desired location. With ExpressVPN, you also have the option to add a server location to Favorites for easy access in the future.\n\nAVG Secure VPN offers specialized servers for streaming and torrenting in select countries. This helps you quickly find the right connection for these activities.\n\nWhen it comes to device support, ExpressVPN has a clear advantage. In addition to the standard platforms, ExpressVPN offers apps for routers, Linux, Amazon Fire TV Stick, and even Apple TV. This wide range of supported devices makes it easy to protect all your devices.\n\nUnfortunately, AVG Secure does not currently offer support for routers or Linux. It also lacks dedicated apps for streaming devices like the Fire TV Stick and Apple TV.\n\nReliability & Support — Both VPNs Have Responsive Customer Support\n\nExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN both offer assistance through 24/7 live chat and email. I put both VPNs' support to the test and found that they were responsive and helpful.\n\nI contacted AVG's 24/7 live chat and was connected to an agent in under a minute. I asked if AVG Secure VPN can be set up on routers, and the agent quickly informed me that it only works with Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android devices.\n\nExpressVPN's live chat support was similarly quick and efficient. The agents were knowledgeable and able to answer my questions about device compatibility, troubleshooting, and more.\n\nIn terms of online resources, both VPNs offer knowledge bases, FAQs, and setup guides. However, ExpressVPN's knowledge base is more comprehensive, covering a wider range of topics and offering more detailed tutorials. This can be particularly helpful if you're new to VPNs or encounter a technical issue.\n\nTips on Choosing Between ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN\n\nThere are several key factors to consider when it comes to selecting the right VPN for your needs. Here are some tips to help you choose between ExpressVPN and AVG Secure VPN:\n\nStreaming compatibility — the best VPNs can safely access services like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, and Amazon Prime Video from anywhere. ExpressVPN is one of them, but AVG Secure wasn't as good in our tests.\n\nServer network — consider the breadth and distribution of the VPN's server network. A larger network with servers in more countries will give you more options for finding a fast and reliable connection, as well as access to a wider range of IP addresses.\n\nDevice compatibility — ensure that the VPN you choose supports all the devices and platforms you plan to use. Consider not just your computer and smartphone but also any streaming devices, gaming consoles, or routers you may want to protect.\n\nSecurity features — assess the VPN's security measures, including encryption strength, leak protection, and kill switch functionality. Additional features like split tunneling and ad blocking can provide an extra layer of security and flexibility.\n\nPrivacy practices — scrutinize the VPN's privacy policy, jurisdiction, and data handling practices. A clear no-logs policy, minimal data collection, and a privacy-friendly location are key indicators of a VPN's commitment to protecting your privacy.\n\nEase of use — consider the user-friendliness of the VPN's apps and interface. Look for intuitive layouts, quick-connect options, and clear server labeling. The VPN should make it easy to find and connect to the servers you need without excessive complexity.\n\nCustomer support — evaluate the quality and availability of the VPN's customer support. Check if they offer 24/7 live chat, email support, or a comprehensive knowledge base. Responsive and knowledgeable support can make a big difference if you encounter any issues or have questions.\n\nValue for money — compare the features and performance of each VPN against its price. Consider the length of the subscription, the number of simultaneous connections allowed, and any additional benefits like a free trial or money-back guarantee. Choose the VPN that offers the best balance of features and affordability for your needs.\n\nExpressVPN vs AVG Secure VPN — Reddit Opinions\n\nTo get a sense of how these VPNs perform in the real world, I took a deep dive into Reddit threads where users share their honest opinions.\n\nExpressVPN earns high praise for its fast speeds, strong security, and reliable access to streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ in great quality. Users also appreciate its proven no-logs policy and responsive customer support. However, some users mention that it’s a bit expensive."
