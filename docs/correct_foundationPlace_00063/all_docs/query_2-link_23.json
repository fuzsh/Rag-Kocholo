        "text": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nAMSTERDAM, Nov. 9, 2010 —AVG Technologies, the world’s leading provider of free Consumer security solutions, today announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based DroidSecurity, a pioneer in cloud-based mobile security, from its founders and investors. DroidSecurity is the only company of its scale exclusively focused on protecting smartphones, tablets and other devices running on the Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android™ operating system.\n\nThe acquisition enables AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team (MST) to extend its security offerings for its more than 110 million consumers and small businesses in 170 countries to include the rapidly expanding mobile security arena. In October 2010, DroidSecurity’s mobile security app, antivirus free, surpassed the 4.5 million download milestone, making it one the most popular security applications on the Android platform. This milestone reflects important trends taking place in the mobile security arena, including the security consciousness of Android users, the explosive growth of the Android marketplace, and an exceptionally strong user demand for mobile security.\n\n“The potential that exists within the mobile space is extraordinary, and we predict that devices like smart phones will overtake PCs in 2012,” said J.R. Smith, chief executive officer, AVG. “AVG acquired DroidSecurity to accelerate our delivery of sophisticated mobile security and provide users around the world with the reliable and secure technology they need to confidently mitigate the risks associated with using mobile devices.”\n\n“DroidSecurity and AVG share a common vision of securing consumers, small businesses and enterprises, and we believe there is a green field of opportunity when it comes to making sure mobile devices are protected,” said Eran Pfeffer, CEO and co-founder, DroidSecurity. “Integrating our security technologies will allow mobile users to leverage the power of their mobile devices without compromising their personal security or that of their organizations.”\n\nAndroid smartphone devices and applications continue to proliferate at an astonishing pace, making it the world's fastest-growing mobile platform. According to one recent study by research firm NPD Group, the Android operating system continued to shake up the U.S. mobile phone market during the first quarter of 2010, edging out Apple's (NASDAQ: APPL) OS for the #1 spot. The number of applications on the Android market is also expected to see massive growth as Google facilitates the development of mobile programs for the platform with do-it-yourself programs such as its recently-launched App Inventor, which make it simple for users of any experience level to create programs.\n\nThis strong momentum for Android is being witnessed directly by DroidSecurity and is evidenced in the company's user stats. Of the 100,000+ apps currently available on the Android market, DroidSecurity antivirus free consistently ranks in the top 50 of most popular apps. According to company estimates, over 4.5 million Android mobile devices have downloaded DroidSecurity, making DroidSecurity among the largest and fastest growing providers of anti-virus apps for the Android market and among the fastest growing apps today.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, DroidSecurity will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AVG and will continue to be headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. CEO and co-founder, Eran Pfeffer, will become the general manager of AVG’s Mobile Solutions Team (MST). The completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\n\nKeep in touch with AVG -- For breaking news, follow AVG on Twitter at www.twitter.com/officialAVGnews -- For security news analysis, follow AVG Chief Research Officer Roger Thompson’s blog at http://thompson.blog.avg.com/ -- Join our Facebook community at www.facebook.com/avgfree\n\nAbout DroidSecurity DroidSecurity™, makers of the first full-featured Android anti-malware application DroidSecurity mobile Security Suite, was founded in 2009 by Dror Shalev, Omri Sigelman and Eran Pfeffer, and is based in Tel Aviv, Israel.
