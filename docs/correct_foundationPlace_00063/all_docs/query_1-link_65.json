        "text": "German company Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG) has signed an agreement to use software solutions from IVU Traffic Technologies for planning and managing vehicles and staff.\n\nIVU.rail software will be able to provide a single solution that combines all planning processes and one database.\n\nThe agreement also includes a mobile IVU.pad for electronic communication with train drivers to help them receive duty information and work documents through a tablet in future.\n\nIVU CEO Martin Müller-Elschner said: “We are very much looking forward to working with AVG. This agreement underlines the confidence in our company and our product, with which we are creating a foundation for reliable decisions in railway operations.”\n\nIVU’s software also enables continuous data-flow between the individual planning steps and other systems in-use at AVG for HR or workshop management.\n\nIt takes all operational rules and quality requirements of AVG into account.\n\n\"We are concentrating most of the data relevant to our dispatchers in one system, enabling us to accelerate our planning processes.\"\n\nAVG managing director Ascan Egerer said: “From now on, AVG will be handling all its operational planning with the IVU.rail software: from vehicle working scheduling and vehicle usage planning of all trams and trains to duty scheduling and personnel dispatch of its drivers.\n\n“With this move, we are concentrating most of the data relevant to our dispatchers in one system, enabling us to accelerate our planning processes.”\n\nIVU Traffic has collaborated with European rail operators to develop the IVU.rail software.\n\nUsers of the dispatching system include the state railway companies or their successors in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, Finland, Hungary and Canada."
