        "text": "A Quick Overview\n\nAVG started in 1992 as Anti-Virus Guard, but it didn’t enter the U.S. market until 1998. That said, it only really took off after the new millennium thanks largely to its free software.\n\nThe AVG we see today has a lot of similarities to the service it was back in the early 2000s, but there have obviously been a lot of upgrades. For example, AVG added anti-spyware software to its list of features in 2006, and in 2008 it added LinkScanner, a feature that can detect unsafe websites — both groundbreaking functions for their time.\n\nOver the years, AVG as a company has gone through many other changes. It was acquired by Avast in 2016,1 for example, and then recently by NortonLifeLock in 20222. By and large, however, AVG continues to exist and operate as a separate brand with its own products and services.\n\nThose are what we’ll be tackling in this review: Are AVG’s products good? Do they offer enough digital protection? How do they compare to other antivirus products? Is AVG one of the best antivirus software? Let’s find out.\n\nDownloading the Software\n\nDownloading AVG Antivirus software was straightforward enough. The company’s homepage has a nice bright green link right at the top offering a “Free Download.” Of course, there are links to the paid Mac, PC, and Mobile versions, but we prefer to try things out before we lay any money down. And to be honest, AVG makes it easy to start with a free plan, which includes a file scanner and a basic firewall against viruses and malware; the download and installation took under a minute.\n\nOnce we were convinced that the tools they offered were worth an investment, there was an easy option in the program’s drop-down menu to enter an activation code. We instantly went from Basic to Full protection, which included access to webcam protection, payment protection, and an advanced firewall.\n\nLike a lot of antivirus companies out there, AVG seems always out to convince us that we won’t be completely safe until we’ve purchased enough subscriptions to feel as though our computer is as protected as Fort Knox. We saw the same marketing tactics from Avast, Kaspersky, and almost every other antivirus software we tested.\n\nIn AVG’s case, our first encounter with those advertisements came after performing a Smart Scan. It highlighted three areas. The first area was about operating system issues, like our notifications appearing when on our laptop’s lockscreen. AVG resolved that issue with one click of the “Resolve” button. The next area was viruses and malware. It found nothing, so we moved on to the third area: Advanced issues.\n\nHere, AVG found that our computer was “cluttered” and slowed down by 314 performance issues requiring our immediate attention. Of course, the moment we clicked the “Resolve” button, we were taken to a link where we were encouraged to buy more software. We’ve never been especially cool with these sorts of marketing tricks. Does our computer really need a tune-up just six months after we bought it? We’re doubtful.\n\nStill, AVG didn’t actually lie and tell us our computer had malware when it didn’t. If there’s one thing we won’t stand for, it’s flat-out lying. In the end, once we knew the scans were always going to claim we had performance issues, it was a pretty simple matter to ignore the constant advice that we repair them.\n\nFYI: Ransomware can attack your device using a number of different vectors. All of them have the same result, however: ransomware encrypts user files and then demands a ransom to restore them.\n\nThe Experience of Using AVG\n\nLike we said before, we took the time to see what came in the free package before we went all in. Below, we outline both experiences.\n\nFree Package\n\nAs soon as we opened the software, the main page laid our options out in clear, easy-to-understand terms. At the bottom of the screen, a button offered us an on-demand Smart Scan. Of course, we pushed that before we bothered checking out the other tools, and to our great relief discovered in under five minutes that we were virus-free.\n\nWe liked the Smart Scan feature as opposed to an initial full scan of drives, memory, and rootkits (or Deep Scan in AVG’s terms). It was quick and it immediately gave us an overview of our computer’s health. As we detailed earlier, it looked at not just malware and viruses, but also potential operating system and advanced issues (like our webcam being potentially vulnerable to spying).\n\nThat said, it may make sense to do a Deep Scan as well. The Smart Scan may cover a wider scope of potential issues, but the Deep Scan looks for malware in more areas, not just the ones where viruses normally hide. We did end up doing a Deep Scan later on, which took 34 minutes.\n\nOther scan features include scheduled scans, wherein the app scans your computer at a scheduled time, and file scans, wherein AVG scans a specific file of your choosing. The latter comes in handy after downloading an email attachment or a file off the internet. Although the File Shield feature (more on this below) can detect potentially malicious incoming files, the file scan feature is a nice additional layer of protection.\n\nAbove the Scan button, the page displayed our additional options. To the left were our two primary tools, those that came with the free version. On the right, AVG reminded us of the three tools that were unlocked when we put in our credit card. The free tools included:\n\nComputer protection: Computer protection essentially means what it says. AVG kept a constant eye on the health of our computer, ensuring it was fine now and that it stayed that way. Selecting this icon opened another, equally user-friendly page detailing the various functions within computer protection, which we could turn off and on individually.\n\nFile Shield: This shield scanned every file either added to or opened on our computer. It made sure we didn’t download any nasty files in the first place, but just in case something did sneak past, it scanned all these files again each and every time we opened them.\n\nBehavior Shield: This shield monitored all our applications, looking for any suspicious behaviors that might indicate something malicious at work.\n\nRansomware Protection: This tool walled off all of our files, ensuring they weren’t vulnerable to attacks from ransomware.\n\nNetwork Inspector: Last, but not least, this tool scanned our entire Wi-Fi network and provided useful information about all our connected devices. Turns out we’d forgotten to shut down our Kindle after getting caught up in a mystery one night!\n\nWeb and email protection: Web and email protection is designed to make sure we’re safe while we’re surfing and includes two more specific functions.\n\nWeb shield: AVG’s web shield kept us from logging onto any suspicious websites and blocked any potentially unsafe downloads.\n\nEmail shield: Meanwhile, the email shield kept an eye on our emails, making sure we weren’t exposed to unsafe attachments. Web and email protection: Web and email protection is designed to make sure we’re safe while we’re surfing and includes two more specific functions.\n\nAt the top of the main page, we discovered a drop-down menu with a couple of more tools, including a data shredder and a quarantine folder. The data shredder allowed us to permanently and irreversibly remove a file, a folder, or an entire disc from our computer. The quarantine folder, on the other hand, provided a safe place to store any suspicious files, completely isolating them from the rest of the system.\n\nOne of our favorite tools, though, was the Do Not Disturb mode. We gave AVG a list of which programs require our absolute uninterrupted attention: spreadsheets, for example, and solitaire. AVG made sure that when those programs were running full-screen nothing and nobody could bother us. No pop-ups: none. Not even, incidentally, from AVG itself.\n\nFinally, the drop-down menu included a list of other AVG services to check out.\n\nFor free software, AVG is quite comprehensive. Notably, it includes ransomware protection and a sort of a real-time protection feature in File Shield, which are features often reserved for premium software. For example, Kaspersky’s free antivirus, one of the best free antivirus software, limits its features to just on-demand scans.\n\nOf course, you have to consider how effective the free software is at detecting malware – here, Kaspersky really stands out, scoring 100-percent on our virus detection test – but if you want free antivirus with lots of useful features, then AVG is a strong choice.\n\nTip: A behavior shield constantly scans your computer looking for processes that exhibit suspicious behaviors. Once it detects such behaviors, it can block the file, even if the malware itself hasn’t yet been added to the virus database.\n\nPaid Package\n\nIn the end, we liked our free experience with AVG so much that we decided to go with its Internet Security package (there is also an Ultimate package). Once we keyed in the activation code, three more functions, located on the right-hand side of the main page, magically lit up as well, including more protection modes:\n\nHacker attack protection: The three functions here made sure we were safe not merely from random viruses, but also from specific attacks from hackers.\n\nEnhanced firewall: While the free version of the software offered us some basic protection against hackers, the enhanced firewall looked for more targeted attacks.\n\nPassword protection: This feature kept our saved passwords nice and secure, allowing us to autofill forms when we wanted but only when we wanted.\n\nRemote access shield: This shield made sure we were impervious to unwanted remote connections.\n\nPrivacy protection: We’re sort of rabid about maintaining our privacy, and these functions meant we had no worries on that score.\n\nWebcam protection: This feature ensured no one could use spyware to access our webcam.\n\nSensitive data shield: This shield prevented snooping on our most sensitive documents.\n\nPayment protection: Finally, the paid version of AVG provided complete protection for all our online purchases.\n\nFake website shield: As part of maintaining our safety, the fake web shield made certain we weren’t taken in by any fake websites phishing for our credit card data.\n\nWe installed the package on 10 different devices; we have a lot of devices, okay? And as a bonus, it came with a VPN, a virtual private network that routes your online surfing through a third party server so that your browsing and even your IP address are shielded from prying eyes. If you’re interested in comparing AVG’s VPN to others on the market, check out our list of the best VPNs.\n\nPutting AVG’s Virus Detection to the Test\n\nAny antivirus software is only as good as its ability to do its job: stop viruses. That’s why we took the time and effort to download (but not open!) five files that we knew contained viruses. Of course, we made sure to check out a variety, from adware to Trojan malware. In the end, AVG managed to detect three of the five, a 60 percent success rate. We were alarmed at first, until we discovered that this is actually a pretty standard percentage for antivirus software. We tested over 40 different programs and found only two that managed to catch 100 percent of what we threw at them, believe it or not.\n\nOur Tests\n\nXLSX file: First up, we tested AVG’s prowess with a spreadsheet file, Order.XLSX, a tricky little virus that would have tried to convince us to turn off our AVG protections so it could steal our browser histories, passwords, and email credentials. Only 34 percent of antivirus programs detected this one, so we weren’t terribly surprised that AVG failed as well.\n\nEXE file: Next we checked out whether AVG could spot RsBvabnsg1, a virus that frequently appears in the form of an exe. RsBvabnsg1 is better known as AgentTelsa, a remote access tool (RAT) that allows bad guys to completely take over a computer. Luckily, the majority of programs manage to catch this one, 66 percent, and AVG managed to also.\n\nDOC file: We find doc files to be especially pernicious since we do a lot of writing and files can sort of just blend together. We tested Reservation.doc, and AVG did manage to detect it. This was an impressive result given that only around 36 percent of all programs spotted it.\n\nXLSM file: AVG let us down again on this one, 97655499.xlsm, which usually shows up as an email attachment. Only 35 percent of antivirus software programs managed to detect it though.\n\nXLS file: Finally, we ran a check for BDO-1218.xls, an xls file that about half of antivirus programs manage to find. Here AVG performed well, detecting it with ease.\n\nIn the end, here’s how AVG measured up.\n\nVirus File Type Percent of Antivirus Software That Detected It Did AVG Detect It? XLSX 34% No EXE 66% Yes DOC 36% Yes XLSM 35% No XLS 51% Yes\n\nLab Tests\n\nJust to set our minds completely at ease, we also checked out how AVG performed in independent tests run by AV Test.3 In terms of protection, AVG received a six out of six. Under performance, AVG was also rated six out of six. And in terms of usability, they were awarded six out of six as well. Those are pretty good scores overall, but how about AVG’s virus detection?\n\nWe were more excited to discover that when it came to detecting the most recent viruses, malware released over the last month, AVG had a strong 99.9 percent success rate."
