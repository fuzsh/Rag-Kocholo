WIC is a nutrition education and food assistance program for pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women and children up to five years of age. WIC can help families find other needed resources like doctors, dentists and medical insurance. I-Smile services will also be offered to children and pregnant people at these clinics which includes a dental screening, fluoride varnish, education and referral to a dentist.\n\nJCPH is offering WIC clinics throughout Johnson County to improve the accessibility to services for county residents especially where transportation is a barrier. “We analyzed the addresses of families currently receiving WIC and families who are eligible for Medicaid to identify clusters of where they live and sites for clinics to close these clusters. We anticipate this will help families already on WIC as well as attract families who have never been on WIC due to transportation issues,” said Chuck Dufano, WIC Coordinator for Johnson County.\n\nClinics will be open monthly from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the following sites in North Liberty and Coralville:\n\nSecond Tuesday of the month beginning Oct. 11\n\nNorth Liberty Community Center\n\n520 W.

Perfect for fans of Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Timmy Failure , King of the Bench is an ode to teammates, underdogs, and bench-warmers everywhere. Steve is King of the Bench. No brag. It’s just a fact. But this year, Steve and his friends are excited to try out for the Spiro T. Agnew Middle School baseball team. The only problem is, after watching another player get beaned by a fastball, Steve has developed a serious case of bean-o-phobia—the fear of getting hit by a pitch. If Steve ever wants to get off the bench and get in the game, he’s going to have to muster up some courage, and fast . Oh, and if you’re wondering why Steve would write a book and tell total strangers all about the humiliating phobia that almost ruined his first year on the baseball team? Duh. It’s pretty much a rule that you spill your guts when you write a book about yourself.\n\nAdditional copies of the book are available at the North Liberty Library.\n\n6:00 pm – 8:00 pm Ranshaw House Concert Series\n\n6:00 pm – 8:00 pm\n\nRanshaw House Concert Series\n\nRanshaw House Lawn, 515 Community Drive\n\nWho: You!
