        "text": "We tested AVG AntiVirus Free to find out if it's the right antivirus software to make your digital life more secure.\n\nAVG AntiVirus Free\n\n4\n\nDaily updates\n\nPassive mode\n\nNo parental controls\n\nInfo current as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nBy Kasey Tross\n\n5 min read\n\nSafeWise experts have years of firsthand experience testing the products we recommend. Learn how we test and review.\n\nAntivirus software detects and blocks viruses, spyware, ransomware, adware, and other damaging programs that can infect your hard drive and leave you open to identity theft. Online, it can warn you of potentially harmful links and deep scan websites for malware.\n\nAVG AntiVirus software uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to recognize the operating patterns and warning signs of malware on your computer and online.\n\nAVG antivirus software works in the background anytime your computer is turned on, and when the program discovers a cyber threat, it alerts you and places the infected files into quarantine so you can't accidentally access them.\n\nYou can then remove the files with just a few clicks. AVG doesn't work with mobile iOS devices, but it does work with Apple computers, PC, and Android devices.\n\nPros\n\nEasy download and installation\n\nUser-friendly interface\n\nMinimal impact to computer speeds\n\nExcellent malware protection\n\nUseful extra features\n\nCons\n\nNot compatible with iPhone\n\nNo parental controls\n\n2019 data breach\n\nIn December 2019, Avast collected unnecessary user data such as browsing history and activity through Avast subsidiary Jumpshot. Its privacy policy defends storing user data since it’s anonymized, but the company offered no clear policy on length of data retention.\n\nAvast has since severed ties with Jumpshot, though we have to recommend this software cautiously because of its history. Read our best antivirus and anti-malware software guide to learn more about our top picks.\n\nPricing and plans\n\nAVG AntiVirus Free is the company’s basic plan. You can get the free download that includes a limited amount of security features:\n\nStops viruses, ransomware, spyware, and other malware\n\nBlocks unsafe links, downloads, and email attachments\n\nScans for PC performance problems\n\nGives real time-security updates\n\nTo get more than the free version offers, you'll need to upgrade to the AVG Internet Security package for about $78 a year.\n\nCompare AVG AntiVirus Free to AVG Full Internet Security\n\nInfo current as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nAVG features and usability\n\nAVG's AntiVirus Free has plenty of useful features that are usually reserved for paid subscriptions, and its customization options allow you to choose how and when your virus scans happen.\n\nNo parental controls\n\nUnlike other antivirus software offerings, AVG's program doesn't include options for parents to block certain websites or content on kids' devices. Here are our top picks for parental control apps.\n\nPassive mode\n\nIf you already have a built-in antivirus app on your computer, you can still download AVG as a backup. Its passive mode allows it to run as backup virus protection while not interfering with your primary antivirus program. If AVG catches something the primary malware detection program misses, it will alert you.\n\nFile shredder\n\nAVG AntiVirus Free comes with a file shredder that lets you permanently wipe files using the same technology as the US Department of Defense.\n\nScan controls\n\nAVG lets you customize how it conducts scans. You can schedule scans for specific times, adjust the intensity of the scans to minimize impact on your computer speeds, and even exclude specific files from being scanned.\n\nDark user interface\n\nWhen you run AVG, you'll see a black background with green text. Not everyone likes the dark color scheme.\n\nNo quick scan option\n\nUnlike other free antivirus software, AVG AntiVirus doesn't have a quick scan option, but it does take less time to scan your drive each time you use it.\n\nNo automatic USB scan\n\nYou can run scans on USB drives when you plug them in, but you'll have to do it manually, as there's no auto-scan option.\n\nAVG installation\n\nAVG's AntiVirus Free has many useful features that are usually reserved for paid subscriptions, and its customization options allow you to choose how and when your virus scans happen.\n\nFast download\n\nOur download of the free AVG program took just three minutes from start to finish.\n\nSimple installation\n\nAVG provides easy instructions for downloading and installing the system, making it simple enough for anyone to do it.\n\nConfusing website\n\nWhen we had some issues with the program on our Mac, we went to the AVG website first to find solutions on the message boards. We found the site counterintuitive and difficult to navigate. We recommend registering on the website so you can contact the help desk directly with any questions you may have.\n\nAVG protection and performance\n\nAVG AntiVirus Free holds its own against pricier antivirus software in independent testing, but Mac users beware—AVG AntiVirus is clearly designed for the PC crowd.\n\nDaily updates\n\nAVG recognizes that new malware pops up on the internet daily, so it not only blocks new threats when they attack; it also sends them to the AVG online lab for analysis. AVG then updates all its users with the new virus definitions.\n\nMinimal impact\n\nExcellent scores\n\nMac compatible\n\nNot available for mobile iOS\n\nAVG has security software for your iPhone or iPad, but it isn’t antivirus software. Instead, you can get AVG's VPN program for a small monthly fee on your mobile device. VPN connections make it harder for threats to find you so you can safely browse the web in public. Check out our best VPN services review to learn more.\n\nCompare the best antivirus and anti-malware software\n\nAmazon.com price as of post date. Offers and availability may vary by location and are subject to change. Read full disclaimer.\n\nFinal word\n\nAVG AntiVirus Free performs well in independent testing, and PC users are very happy with it. If you're looking for a simple way to beef up the security on your PC using an antivirus program, the AVG AntiVirus Free is a great choice. If you want to protect all of your devices from online threats, no matter who is using them, then AVG Internet Security can give you added peace of mind.\n\nFAQ\n\nIt depends—AVG Internet Security is better for those who spend a lot of time online, with enhanced firewall protection and protection against malicious websites.\n\nThe upgraded program also covers all devices used by you or your family, and it includes the AVG AntiVirus Professional for your Android device.\n\nWhen you complete a full computer scan using AVG AntiVirus FREE, you might get alerts about junk files, cookies, etc., but you can only fix these problems using a different AVG program called AVG PC TuneUp.\n\nAVG PC Tuneup identifies unnecessary files that are using up memory and outdated programs that are causing your PC to run slowly. It automatically updates your software, clears up memory space, and plugs holes in your security. It costs $64.99 per year.\n\nYes, it does gather data from your usage history. But after installing the program, you can opt out of data collection under the privacy settings.\n\nSoftware security experts recommend cleaning up and defragmenting your hard disk and uninstalling any unnecessary software before installing an antivirus program.\n\nLeaving at least 20% of your disk free allows your antivirus program to run without slowing down your computer. Be patient and allow the antivirus software to do its job, even if it does create lag in normal computer operations.\n\nYes, but unfortunately, it’s not free. AVG has a VPN service available for iPhones and iPads.\n\nHow we reviewed AVG AntiVirus Free\n\nWe created our AVG AntiVirus review by studying its software, reading others' reviews of the program, and downloading and trying the program for ourselves.
