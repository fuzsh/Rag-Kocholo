Multiple class actions have been initiated that are based on claims of GDPR non-compliance, such as:\n\nTikTok – Foundation Mass Damage & Consumer (SMC) (only available in Dutch here). This €6 billion claim alleges that TikTok exploits the personal data of its users, in violation of the GDPR, and various Dutch laws, including the Dutch Telecommunications Act (only available in Dutch here), consumer and advertising laws and media law;.\n\nTikTok – Foundation Take Back Your Privacy (STBYP) and the Dutch Consumer Association (Consumentenbond) (only available in Dutch here and here). This €1.5 billion claim alleges that TikTok exploits the personal data of child users, in violation of the GDPR and Dutch and European consumer law. Amongst others, the claim argues that TikTok:\n\ndoes not comply with the principles of data minimization and transparency;\n\nprocesses personal data without a lawful basis; and\n\ndoes not obtain valid consent from children and, where necessary, their parents or guardians;\n\nTikTok - Foundation for Market Information Research (SOMI) (more information available here). This €1.4 billion claim alleges that TikTok violates Dutch and EU privacy and consumer laws and unlawfully exposes minors to harmful content. Amongst others, the claims argues that TikTok is violating the GDPR by:\n\nprofiling children for marketing purposes;\n\nfailing to obtain valid consent for the use of personal data;\n\nnot specifying which personal data are collected for which purposes;\n\nfailing to provide children with special protection;\n\ncollecting and storing more personal data than necessary; and\n\nfailing to meet the requirements for storing and securing personal data.\n\nRegarding the three claims against TikTok: the District Court Amsterdam declared SOMI to be admissible in the proceedings against TikTok on October 25, 2023, ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2023:6694 (only available in Dutch here). On January 10, 2024, the District Court Amsterdam declared STBYP and SMC to be admissible in the proceedings against TikTok as well. STBYP has been appointed as the exclusive representative for minors and SMC has been appointed as the exclusive representative for adults (ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2024:83, only available in Dutch here);\n\nSalesforce and Oracle – the Privacy Collective.This €10 billion claim alleges that Salesforce and Oracle unlawfully processed the personal data of website visitors, among other things, because of their crucial role in the Real Time Bidding (RTB) process. The Privacy Collective was declared inadmissible by the District Court of Amsterdam (ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:7647 of 29 December 29, 2021, only available in Dutch here). The Privacy Collective has filed an appeal to this decision. The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam is expected on June 18, 2024;\n\nAmazon – Foundation Data Protection The Netherlands (SDBN) (only available in Dutch here). This claim alleges that Amazon violated the GDPR, the Dutch Telecommunications Act, and the Dutch Unfair Commercial Practices Act (only available in Dutch here), with its personalized advertising practices, its use of tracking cookies without data subjects’ consent and its insufficient level of data security. The subpoena was issued on October 18, 2023;\n\nAdobe – SDBN also filed a claim against Adobe (only available in Dutch here). This claim alleges that Adobe violated the GDPR, Dutch laws, including the Dutch Telecommunications Act, and various fundamental rights by creating consumer profiles to show personalized advertising and by placing tracking cookies without data subjects’ consent. The subpoena was issued on December 13, 2023; and\n\nTwitter – SDBN also filed a claim against Twitter (only available in Dutch here). This claim alleges that Twitter violated the GDPR and Dutch law, including the Dutch Telecommunications Act, with its previous company MoPub. MoPub gathered user data through more than 30.000 apps, which it consequently shared with commercial parties. SDBN’s president, Anouk Ruhaak, implied that damages could reach several billion euros. The subpoena was issued on September 13, 2023.\n\n2. Scope of Application\n\n2.1. Personal scope\n\nThe personal scope of the Act is equivalent to the personal scope of the GDPR. It applies to all processing of personal data, wholly or in-part through automated means, by private and public organizations of personal data of directly or indirectly identifiable natural persons.

Territorial scope\n\nThe territorial and extraterritorial scope of the Act is equivalent to the territorial and extraterritorial scope of the GDPR. This means that the Act applies to the processing of personal data:\n\nin the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Netherlands, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not; and\n\nof data subjects who are in the Netherlands by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related to:\n\nthe offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Netherlands; or\n\nthe monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within the Netherlands.\n\n2.3. Material scope\n\nThe material scope of the Act is similar to the material scope of the GDPR. The Act applies to:\n\nthe processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means;\n\nthe processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system;\n\nthe processing of personal data in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of EU law; and\n\nthe processing of personal data by the armed forces when performing activities that fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\nHowever, the Act does not apply to the processing of personal data:\n\nin so far as such processing is subject to the Personal Records Database Act (only available in Dutch here), the Elections Act, or the Advisory Referendum Act of 2014 (only available in Dutch here);\n\nas set out in Article 2(2) of the GDPR;\n\nby the armed forces, in so far as the Minister of Defense decides on this for purposes of deploying the armed forces or making them available to carry out the tasks described in Article 97 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 2008; and\n\nin so far as it is subject to the Intelligence and Security Services Act 2002.\n\n3. Data Protection Authority | Regulatory Authority\n\n3.1. Main regulator for data protection\n\nThe supervisory authority for data protection in the Netherlands, the AP, was appointed in accordance with Article 51 of the GDPR and Article 6 of the Act.\n\n3.2. Main powers, duties and responsibilities\n\nThe AP has the power to exercise its authority and tasks as assigned to supervisory authorities under Articles 57 and 58 of the GDPR, and specifically to the AP under Articles 14 to 21(a) of the Act. The powers as set out in the Act refer to the powers as included in the Dutch General Administrative Law Act (only available in Dutch here) (the Administrative Act). Pursuant to the GDPR and Act, the AP can among other things:\n\nimpose administrative fines;\n\nimpose orders under penalty;\n\nmonitor compliance;\n\nexercise advisory powers;\n\ncooperate with other supervisory authorities; and\n\nproceed legal action against infringements regarding transfers to third countries.\n\nThe AP is bound by the requirements as included in the Administrative Act.\n\n4.

Legal Bases\n\nThe Act does not contain additional legal bases for the processing of personal data. Therefore, only the legal bases under Article 6 GDPR apply.\n\n5.1. Consent\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.2. Contract with the data subject\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.3. Legal obligations\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.4. Interests of the data subject\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.5. Public interest\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.6. Legitimate interests of the data controller\n\nLegal basis under the GDPR apply.\n\n5.7. Legal bases in other instances\n\nNational implementation of Article 89 of the GDPR\n\nAccording to Article 44 of the Act, and Articles 15, 16, and 18 of the GDPR do not apply in case personal data is processed by institutions or services for scientific research or statistics, and the required safeguards are put in place to ensure that the personal data can only be used for such purposes.\n\nAccording to Article 45 of the Act, and Articles 15, 16, 18(1)(a), and 20 of the GDPR do not apply in cases where personal data is processed that is included in archives within the meaning of the Dutch Public Records Act 1995 (only available in Dutch here) (the Public Records Act). The data subject has the right of access to the archived records, unless the request for access cannot reasonably be granted because the request is not specified sufficiently. A data subject has the right to add its own understanding of the relevant data to the archived records in cases where incorrect personal data is processed.\n\nProcessing national identification numbers\n\nAccording to Article 46 of the Act, the processing of national identification numbers is only allowed if such processing is provided for by law, and only for the purposes prescribed by that law.\n\n6. Principles\n\nIn the Netherlands, the principles of data protection law are set out in the GDPR. This means that all personal data must be:\n\nprocessed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner;\n\ncollected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (purpose limitation);\n\nadequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization);\n\naccurate and, where necessary, kept up to date (accuracy);\n\nkept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (storage limitation); and\n\nprocessed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).\n\nThe controller is responsible for ensuring that the principles are met and must be able to demonstrate compliance at all times.\n\n7. Controller and Processor Obligations\n\n7.1. Data processing notification\n\nThere are no national notification or registration requirements applicable under the Act.\n\nHowever, the Prior Consultation Guidelines stipulate that prior consultation is required if the outcome of a DPIA indicates a high risk and the data controller is unable to find measures that would limit that risk. Furthermore, the Prior Consultation Guidelines contain a list of steps enabling organizations to determine if prior consultation is necessary.\n\nIf prior consultation is necessary, then the request for prior consultation can be made by a data controller or a data protection officer by sending a form available on the AP's website together with the DPIA to the AP's address. Afterwards, the AP will make an assessment of the information received within 14 weeks, which may be extended if the request is complex. After completing its assessment, the AP will send back a letter to the organization, containing the result of the prior consultation.\n\n7.2. Data transfers\n\nDutch law does not provide for data localization requirements. In addition, the Act does not provide for additional restrictions on the transfer of personal data as set out in the GDPR.\n\n7.3. Data processing records\n\nThere are no national variations or requirements with regard to the obligation for data controllers and/or data processors to maintain data processing records.\n\n7.4. Data protection impact assessment\n\nThere is no overview of activities subject to prior consultation or authorization.\n\nHowever, the AP has published an overview of types of processing activities which require a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) (only available in Dutch here). This includes processing activities relating to:\n\nlarge-scale or systematic monitoring:\n\nin covert investigations, such as for private investigative agencies, anti-fraud investigations, online research (e.g., online copyright infringement), and covert camera surveillance;\n\nof (special categories of) personal data for fraud prevention, including blacklists);\n\nfor the purpose of assessing creditworthiness, such as by establishing credit scores;\n\nof financial data from which the financial positions or individuals' expenditure patterns can be derived;\n\nof genetic data, such as DNA analyses;\n\nin public spaces by means of for example, cameras and drones;\n\nof employees;\n\nof location data;\n\nof communications data;\n\nrelating to IoT applications; and\n\nof biometric data for identification purposes; and\n\nblacklists of personal data concerning criminal convictions and offenses, wrongful conduct, obstinate behavior, and payment performance;\n\nlarge-scale processing of health data (not applicable to individual physicians or health care professionals);\n\npartnerships between municipalities or other governmental bodies and other public or private parties in case special categories of personal data or sensitive personal data are shared;\n\nlarge-scale or systematic flexible camera surveillance;\n\nsystematic and extensive assessment of personal traits by means of automated processing (profiling), such as the assessment of professional performance; or\n\nlarge-scale automated processing of personal data in order to monitor or influence behavior.\n\nNational activities not subject to prior consultation/authorization\n\nThere is no overview of processing activities that are not subject to prior consultation or authorization.\n\nIn its Guidance on DPIAs, the AP has indicated that a DPIA is not required for data processing activities that:\n\nwill probably not constitute a high privacy risk;\n\nare highly similar to other processing activities for which a DPIA has already been conducted;\n\nare governed by another European or Dutch law, and during the drafting stage of this law a DPIA has been carried out, unless the AP finds that a DPIA is nevertheless required; or\n\nare included on a list of processing activities for which no DPIA is required (such a list has currently not been prepared by the AP).\n\nThe AP has issued a DPIA checklist for processing under the Act (only available in Dutch here). In addition, the AP has issued a DPIA checklist for processing that commenced before the implementation of the GDPR (only available in Dutch here).\n\n7.5. Data protection officer appointment\n\nAccording to Article 39 of the Act, a DPO is bound to secrecy of information which has been made available to them by means of a data subject's complaint or request, unless the data subject provides consent to the disclosure of the information.\n\nThe AP has issued Guidelines on DPOs, which is based on the Article 29 Working Party's (WP29) Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (adopted on December 13, 2016, as revised and adopted on April 5, 2017).\n\nA DPO is under a duty to keep information revealed to them, in relation to a complaint or request from a data subject, confidential unless the data subject concerned agrees to the disclosure of such information (Article 39 of the Act).\n\nThe Guidance on positioning provides the following eight principles of DPO's:\n\nthe DPO must be visible within the organization;\n\nthe DPO must be involved, and at an earlier stage, to help organizations identify, evaluate, and mitigate any risks associated with processing operations;\n\nthe DPO must be sufficiently well resourced to be able to perform their tasks;\n\nthe DPO must be aware of the communication from the AP with the organization;\n\nthe DPO acts as a contact point for data subjects for handling data subject requests;\n\nthe DPO is protected by the AP's during an investigation into the organization;\n\nthe AP's can request records of reports and opinions from the DPO's; and\n\nthe DPO must be independent.\n\nFurthermore, organizations are under an obligation to notify the contact details of their DPO to the AP. Notification can be made through the notification form (only available in Dutch here) (Notification Form). In accordance with the privacy statement on the AP's website (only available in Dutch here) (the Privacy Statement), the AP maintains an internal register of DPOs notified by organizations.\n\nIn line with the Privacy Statement, DPOs' personal data are retained by the AP as long as he/she is notified as DPO with the AP. Personal data of a former DPO are deleted after two years once the information that a person is no longer a DPO is passed to the AP, which can be done through the Notification Form. The form is subsequently deleted after three months, in line with the Privacy Statement.\n\nDPOs notified with the AP can send their administrative questions, or questions about the GDPR and the related laws to the AP, by sending an email to [email protected]\n\n7.6. Data breach notification\n\nThe Act does not provide any variations or exemptions on the data breach notification obligation.\n\nThe AP has published guidance regarding data breach notifications on its website, which is based on the data breach guidelines of the EDPB. The AP has also published tips and tricks on notifications for professionals (only available in Dutch here).\n\nNotification to the AP\n\nThe Act does not contain variations or exemptions to the breach notification obligations under Article 33 of the GDPR.\n\nThe AP has to be notified by electronically sending a completed notification form as available on the website of the AP (only available in Dutch here). An existing notification can also be amended or withdrawn on the website by using the reference number of the notification.\n\nNotification to data subjects\n\nThe Act only provides an exemption to the breach notification obligations under Article 34 of the GDPR for financial enterprises. According to Article 42 of the Act, financial enterprises as defined in the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision of 28 September 2006 (only available in Dutch here) (the Financial Supervision Act) are exempt from the obligation under Article 34 of the GDPR to inform data subjects of a personal data breach.\n\nSectoral obligations\n\nAs set out above, certain financial enterprises are exempt from the obligation under Article 34 of the GDPR to inform data subjects of a personal data breach.\n\n7.7.

Examples of such factors are the nature of the breach, the severity of the breach, the duration of the breach, the number of data subjects involved, the intentional or negligent nature of the breach, and the measures taken to limit damages suffered by the data subjects. To illustrate, a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR (for instance, the security of processing) is categorized in penalty category II.
