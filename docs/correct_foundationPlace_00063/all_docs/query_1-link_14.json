Avast will finance the deal with existing cash reserves and debt financing from third party lenders.\n\nThe company said the purchase would help it \"gain scale, technological depth and geographical breadth\". The sale price represents a 32 per cent premium on AVG's average price per share over the last six months.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Avast had a 15 per cent share of the global antivirus market, with AVG on 5 per cent, according to data from Opswat.\n\nThe merger means Avast could overtake current market leader Microsoft, who has a market share of 15.9 percent, making it the largest antivirus company in the world.\n\n\"We are in a rapidly changing industry, and this acquisition gives us the breadth and technological depth to be the security provider of choice for our current and future customers,\" said Avast CEO Vince Steckler in a press release.\n\nAVG CEO Gary Kovacs said that the acquisition would allow them to \"accelerate investments in growing markets\" and \"continue to focus on providing simple-to-use solutions for consumers and businesses\".\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Avast will have a network of more than \"400 million endpoints\". The company said this would allow it to create more \"technically advanced security products\".\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s Computers\n\nA defective CrowdStrike kernel driver sent computers around the globe into a reboot death spiral, taking down air travel, hospitals, banks, and more with it. Here’s how that’s possible.\n\nDon’t Fall for CrowdStrike Outage Scams\n\nSwindlers are spinning up bogus websites in an attempt to dupe people with “CrowdStrike support” scams following the security firm's catastrophic software update.\n\nThe US Supreme Court Kneecapped US Cyber Strategy\n\nAfter the Supreme Court limited the power of federal agencies to craft regulations, it’s likely up to Congress to keep US cybersecurity policy intact.\n\nHackers Claim to Have Leaked 1.1 TB of Disney Slack Messages\n\nA hacker group called “NullBulge” says it stole more than a terabyte of Disney’s internal Slack messages and files from nearly 10,000 channels in an apparent protest over AI-generated art.\n\nAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone Records\n\nA security researcher who assisted with the deal says he believes the only copy of the complete dataset of call and text records of “nearly all” AT&T customers has been wiped—but some risks may remain."
