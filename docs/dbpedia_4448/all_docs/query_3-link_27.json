It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.\n\n(2) U.K.For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories or two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territoty of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n(3) U.K.Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.\n\nArticle 2 U.K.\n\n(1) U.K.This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally consituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1.\n\n(2) U.K.This Convention shall not apply to carriage of mail and postal packages.\n\nCHAPTER II U.K. Documents of Carriage\n\nSection 1.—Passenger Ticket U.K.\n\nArticle 3 U.K.\n\n(1) U.K.In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered containing:\n\n(a)an indication of the places of departure and destination;\n\n(b)if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, and indication of at least one such stopping place;\n\n(c)a notice to the effect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.\n\n(2) U.K.The passenger ticket shall constitute prima facie evidence of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the notice required by paragraph (1) (c) of this Article, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22.\n\nSection 2—Baggage Check U.K.\n\nArticle 4 U.K.\n\n(1) U.K.In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1), shall contain:\n\n(a)an indication of the places of departure and destination;\n\n(b)if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place;\n\n(c)a notice to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to baggage.\n\n(2) U.K.The baggage check shall constitute prima facie evidence of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, non the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention.

If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 19 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nThe carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 20 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nIn the case of passengers and baggage, and in the case of damage occasioned by delay in the carriage of cargo, the carrier shall not be liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 21 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)In the carriage of passengers and baggage, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the person suffering the damage the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.\n\n(2)In the carriage of cargo, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he derives his rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 22 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of 16,600 Special Drawing Rights.

Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.\n\n(2)(a)In the carriage of registered baggage, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the same time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration or interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passenger’s or the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination.\n\n(b)In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the same time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination.\n\n(c)In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.\n\n(3)As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per passenger.\n\n(4)The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.\n\n(5)The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of judgment.\n\n(6)The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party. Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph (2)(b) of Article 22 may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of two hundred and fifty monetary units per kilogramme. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. This sum may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of this sum into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 23 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.\n\n(2)Paragraph (1) of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 24 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)In the carriage of passengers and baggage, any action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this Convention, without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.\n\n(2)In the carriage of cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. Such limits of liability constitute maximum limits and may not be exceeded whatever the circumstances which give rise to the liability.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 25 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nIn the carriage of passengers and baggage, the limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 25A U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is able to invoke under Article 22.\n\n(2)The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants or agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits.\n\n(3)In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 26 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of baggage or cargo without complaint isprima facie evidence that the same have been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage.\n\n(2)In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo has been placed at his disposal.\n\n(3)Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid.\n\n(4)Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 27 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nIn the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 28 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the court having jurisdiction at the place of destination.\n\n(2)Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 29 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.\n\n(2)The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the court seised of the case.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 30 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)In the case of carriage to be performed by various succesive carriers and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision.\n\n(2)In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.\n\n(3)As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 30A U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nNothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nCHAPTER IV U.K.PROVISIONS RELATING TO COMBINED CARRIAGE\n\nTextual Amendments\n\nArticle 31 U.K.\n\nTextual Amendments\n\n(1)In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1.\n\n(2)Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage con"
