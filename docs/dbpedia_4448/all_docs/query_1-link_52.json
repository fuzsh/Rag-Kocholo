        "text": "What to do in Glasgow\n\nIt’s true that Glasgow could be a stepping stone into a wide world of Scottish wilderness - think lochs and highlands, windswept coastline, and moody castles.\n\nBut as alluring as the countryside is, don't be in a rush to leave the city. Its pubs, museums, and thick-accented humor are definitely worth hanging around for.\n\nLooking to immerse yourself in Glasgow’s cultural side? There’s seemingly no end to the art galleries and museums in the city.\n\nFor one, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is an acclaimed temple of art and history (and it's free!). There you’ll find some of Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s work - a designer and architect who left his brilliant art nouveau stamp on his home city. Discover even more of his fine forms at the Glasgow School of Art.\n\nExploring Scotland a little further\n\nOnce you’ve finished exploring the wonders of Glasgow city center, you might want to venture further afield. You could choose to hop to Edinburgh by bus or train, or travel elsewhere and see the incredible nature that Scotland has to offer.\n\nIt’s possible to visit the Loch Lomond area on a day trip from Glasgow, if you wish to keep the city as your base. This stunning lake will have you picking up your jaw from the floor, and it’s possible to boat and kayak upon it.\n\nFrom there, you could choose to venture further north. Fortwilliam is an incredible place for outdoor adventure (think kayaking, hiking, snowboarding and more).\n\nAnd then there are the classic tourist spots of Loch Ness and Glencoe, and adventurous travelers may even choose to visit one of Scotland’s many beautiful islands.\n\nShopping in Glasgow\n\nAlongside the arts, Glasgow has a surprisingly big reputation for shopping. As well as the typical tourist trinkets (anything with tartan or bagpipes, basically). Great gift ideas include whisky, fine woolen items, and traditional foods like shortbread.\n\nGlasgow-specific souvenirs are heavy on Charles Rennie Mackintosh motifs and Scots language slogans, with museum gift shops being a great place to find envy-worthy souvenirs.\n\nVintage stores are also big in Glasgow and you'll find some good ones in and around Byres Road in the West End, along with cool little cafes, gourmet stores, and creative boutiques.\n\nBe sure to browse the Ruthven and Dowanside Lanes to experience the best of this district.\n\nEating and drinking in Glasgow\n\nWhile you can challenge yourself with some traditional Scottish fare (hello haggis!) and investigate some mysterious and lyrically-named dishes (such as cullen skink, clootie dumpling, and cranachan), you may also like to explore some of Glasgow's other culinary offerings.\n\nMany stylish places offer a farm-to-table experience with prime local ingredients including fresh seafood and Scotch Angus beef. The West End is home to plenty of popular restaurants and local eateries.\n\nBe sure to dedicate some of your time to investigating Glasgow's brilliant pub culture, which can be easily found across the city.\n\nMany places serve food (covering everything from classic pub fare to high-end cuisine) alongside real ales, microbrewery beers, and whiskies. Expect timeless decor, friendly locals with tall tales to tell, and sometimes live music too.\n\nBest time to fly to Glasgow\n\nThe best time to visit Glasgow is between March and August, when temperatures reach their peak and daylight hours are long. But while the climate is warmer, the weather is unpredictable and showers can come and go easily.\n\nWinters in the city are characterized by bitter cold and short days, with January being the cheapest month to book tickets to Glasgow. However, the festive season in the build-up to Christmas and Hogmanay (New Year’s Eve) is an exciting time to experience.\n\nIf you find yourself in Scotland in late January, you’ll want to find a local Burns Night celebration to fully immerse yourself in Scottish culture.\n\nGetting around Glasgow\n\nOne of the best ways to explore Glasgow is on foot. Most of the streets are structured in a similar fashion to the grid-like cities of the US, so if you’re equipped with a map then it’s difficult to get lost.\n\nThere are also buses and taxis, but we think that exploring one of the oldest subway systems in the world is an opportunity not to be missed!\n\nCar hire is also an option - maybe better for those who plan to explore the nature in Scotland. But parking can be tricky in the major cities in Scotland, and navigating the one-way road systems boggles the minds of even the local drivers.\n\nFancy a day trip to Edinburgh? The train takes only around 1 hour from Glasgow Queen Street to Edinburgh Waverley station, making it easy to explore both cities on a single trip to Scotland."
