        "text": "Independence in the Air\n\nUntil the period of independence, air service in Africa was operated largely by airlines based in Europe and the United States, or by colonial governments. As new nations attained their independence, the establishment of national airlines soon followed. These airlines served important functions in connecting regions underserved by rail and road infrastructure with the transport of people and goods. Equally as important, they served as symbols of national identity, economic expansion, modernity, technological advancement, and a place on the world stage, carrying the flags of newly independent nations within their borders and abroad.\n\nThis exhibit looks at the history of African airlines in the decades surrounding the 1960s through annual reports, timetables, passenger ephemera, and governmental and nongovernmental reports from the collections of the Transportation Library and the Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University. This includes airlines of newly independent nations, as well as the Africanization of long-established airlines, which prioritized the training and advancement of their countrypeople to positions as executives, pilots, flight attendants, engineers, and managers, as well as establishing self-determination over airline operations.\n\nA joint study of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the Economic Commission for Africa produced a 1964 report titled Air Transport in Africa, covering the 34 independent nations, excluding South Africa, as well as two nations that would become independent the same month the report was published: Nyasaland (today, Malawi) and the Rhodesias (present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia). Maps from that report provide a picture of international and domestic routes, with international routes operated by African airlines in red, and non-African airlines in black."
