        "text": "Once again, British aviation has had quite the nightmare of a year. There have been strikes, huge technical failures and significant staff shortages resulting in thousands of flights being cancelled or delayed.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that sacrifices are having to be made. And several routes from Scotland are among the latest casualties. In 2024, Ryanair will be getting rid of five flights from Edinburgh Airport and one from Glasgow Prestwick as part of measures to cut costs. The axed flights include Edinburgh to Carcassonne, Nîmes and Poitiers in France, to Santiago de Compostela in Spain and Turin in Italy. Glasgow Prestwick is losing its service to Marseille.\n\nIn an announcement, the company said: ‘To ensure that Ryanair continues to offer passengers low fares on an exciting and diverse range of routes, we undertake seasonal route reviews to make way for the development of potentially stronger and more popular routes across our network.’\n\nLoganair is also ditching Scottish flights in response to ‘soft market conditions’ and rising costs. It will be saying goodbye to its major routes from Inverness to Birmingham and Dublin and also getting rid of journeys from Dundee to Kirkwall and Aberdeen to Oslo.\n\nTime Out’s take\n\nAll this is unfortunate news for Scottish travellers, who will probably have to drive extra miles down south or pay for stopovers if they wish to fly to any of the abandoned destinations. On the bright side, at least none of the cancelled routes include the likes of Venice or Rhodes, which were only added to Ryanair’s Edinburgh services this past summer.\n\nICYMI: Is pathetic public transport killing northern nightlife?\n\nPlus: This English city officially has the UK’s highest salaries outside London"
