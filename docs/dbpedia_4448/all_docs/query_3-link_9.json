        "text": "Northeast pioneered service from its Boston base throughout the New England states and into Canada in the 1930s. By the time Northeast merged with Delta on August 1, 1972, its famous \"Yellowbirds\" were jetting to Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda, and across country to Los Angeles, California.\n\nLearn more about Northeast's four decades of service. Check out resources below.\n\nPictorial History of Northeast Airlines, 1933-1972\n\nLively 66-page commemorative booklet published by Northeast for its employees on July 31, 1972, the day before officially merging with Delta. Features many black & white photos of personnel, advertising and operations.\n\nSee Pictorial History\n\nFirst Experiment\n\nNortheast Airlines' roots go back to the first attempt at establishing airline service in the New England states north of Boston, Massachusetts. Local railroads were seeking to participate in this new, growing form of transport. Boston and Maine Railroad, in partnership with the Maine Central Railroads, formed a subsidiary called the Boston-Maine Airways in July 1931.\n\nEntire airline operated under contract by Pan American Airways, or \"Pan Am\". Beginning on August 1, 1931, Pan Am Fokker F-10A planes flew between Boston and Bangor, Maine. From Bangor, Pan Am flew Sikorsky S-41B flying boats to Halifax, Nova Scotia, due to the lack of suitable landing fields.\n\nJust two months later, on September 30, the airline ceased operations. One of the Sikorsky planes had crashed in Massachusetts Bay on August 27, 1931, closing this experimental chapter of Northeast's history.\n\nNortheast Airlines\n\nIn 1933, Boston and Maine Railroad again formed a Boston-Maine Airways subsidiary, which started service on August 11, 1933, from Boston to Portland and Bangor, Maine, using eight-passenger Stinson T planes. The fare from Boston to Bangor cost $23 round-trip.\n\nThe carrier's early flights were operated under contract by National Airways, whose founders included Paul Collins, one of the country's first airmail pilots; Samuel J. Solomon, a pioneer airport operator; Eugene Vidal, a West Point graduate; and Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.\n\nNational Airways made a similar operating agreement on October 27, 1933, with Central Vermont Airways, founded by the Central Vermont Railroad (owned by Canadian National Railway). National Airways coordinated the two railroad-sponsored airlines as one, hyphenating the two railroad names and issuing joint timetables and fares. Central Vermont's route extended from Boston to New Hampshire and Vermont, and on March 20, 1934, to Montreal, Canada.\n\nIn 1937, Boston and Maine purchased National Airways' assets, including its airmail contract, and in November 1940, renamed it Northeast Airlines.\n\nWartime Service\n\nBoston-Maine Airways established one of the first pilot training courses in U.S. in 1939. Excellent reputation of this program resulted in federal government requesting Northeast to operate a wartime national defense program for training advanced flight instructors.\n\nDuring World War II, Northeast's experiences with frigid weather flying also proved invaluable. Northeast pilots were the first to explore the Arctic airways as they made Air Transport Command flights to Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland.\n\nExpansion\n\nThrough mergers and route awards, Northeast rapidly expanded in the post-war period. In July 1944, it took over a route from Newark, New Jersey (serving New York) to Springfield, Massachusetts, previously operated by Airline Feeder System. In August 1944, Northeast acquired small Mayflower Airlines and began service to Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\nEmployees cheered when Northeast was certified to serve New York from Boston in 1945. An \"Every Hour on the Hour\" shuttle service between the two cities started in 1946.\n\nService to Florida started in the mid 1950s, after Northeast was awarded a temporary certificate to operate to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale from Boston, via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nJet Age\n\nThe Jet Age was a roller coaster ride of highs and lows for Northeast!\n\nAmong the highsâ€¦Northeast was one of the first U.S. carriers to offer Boeing 707 jet service, initially between New York and Miami in 1959. Northeast was also the first airline in the world to operate the Boeing 727-200, on December 14, 1967.\n\nIn 1966 the carrier acquired a new image as Northeast planes became known as \"Yellowbirds\" because of their new yellow-and-white painted exteriors. \"Yellowbird\" would become a household word in the areas served by Northeast.\n\nIn spite of initial setbacks, Northeast experienced significant route expansion. Late in 1962, the Civil Aeronautics Board decided to terminate Northeast's temporary certificate to fly to Miami. After years of legal appeals and an unprecedented display of local support from the New England community, Northeast was finally granted a permanent certificate for Florida service in 1967. Service quickly expanded to the Bahamas in 1968, to Bermuda in 1969, and coast-to-coast with a new Miami-Los Angeles route on October 1, 1969.\n\nPersistence financial difficulties and changes in ownership were also part of the 1960s. On May 8, 1962, the Hughes Tool Company, led by famous billionaire Howard Hughes, acquired controlling interest in Northeast Airlines from the Atlas Corporation, which had owned the company since 1938. After the CAB denied renewal of Northeast's Florida route, Hughes announced that he would no longer cover further operating losses. His 55% of the stock was temporarily acquired by trustee L.J. Hector in 1964, then by the Storer Broadcasting Company in 1965."
