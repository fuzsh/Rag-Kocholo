        "text": "HL Deb 05 July 1963 vol 251 cc1100-51 1100\n\n§ 11.47 a.m.\n\n§ LORD FORBES rose to call attention to the urgent need for improved air services and other air facilities in Scotland, so as to help stimulate the Scottish economy; and to move for Papers. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I wish to call attention to the need to improve air services in Scotland because of my firm conviction that improved transport facilities, especially in the form of better air services, would do much to revitalise the whole of Scotland. Before I go on to say how our air services might be improved, I must first explain that, although it is generally appreciated by many who have studied this matter how these services might be improved, I find it far less well known in all circles why it is 1101 so urgent and vital that improvement must be achieved.\n\n§ I believe that Scotland needs an effectual measure to cover the whole country, such as really good internal air services, because without doubt Scotland is a country of immense opportunities, though unfortunately many of these opportunities are not coming to light in the way they should. Instead, Scotland is struggling to overcome two major difficulties: first, the comparatively slow industrial growth, owing to her previous over-dependence on road industry; and, secondly, the drift of population from the remoter parts, especially the Highlands and Borders. There are parts of England, notably the Midlands and the South-East, where the rate of growth is considerable. There are parts of Scotland, such as the industrial belt, where growth is also taking place, though much more slowly; and there are other parts, especially the remoter parts, where the depopulation goes on at a steady rate. This, if left unchecked, must mean that one day parts of the country must inevitably become lifeless deserts.\n\n§ Here I must quote a few figures concerning depopulation, as I think they are revealing and show the seriousness of the situation. Between 1901 and 1961 the Highlands lost 74,655 people, or 21 per cent. of the population existing at the beginning of the century. In the Borders, that is, the four Tweed Counties, there was a loss of 17,266 people, or 14 per cent. of the 1901 figure. Remember that these figures must be measured against an overall increase of 37 per cent. in population for the whole of the United Kingdom during the same period. The people of the Highlands and the Borders are leaving and going to the industrial belt of Scotland, to the Midlands and to South-Eastern England where, to put it quite simply, greater opportunities exist to make use of their education and initiative than are to be found where these people are born and bred. That is the problem.\n\n§ Of course, Scotland does not grudge the rapid economic and material growth in the Midlands and South-East England, brought about largely through the ease of communication and the location of the focal centre of main home markets, finance, technology and government, though ironically and, in some ways, per-1102 haps happily, much of this growth has been brought about by Scottish brains exported South of the Border. Indeed, there is a desire in Scotland to make use of this vital English expansion, and perhaps one can even sense a feeling that those who live in the dangerously congested parts of England often yearn for a short respite in the hills, the glens and the wide open spaces to be found in Scotland. But before any of this can happen the distance barrier, however artificial it may be, must be broken down.\n\n§ The Inquiry into the Scottish Economy 1961 by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), better known as the Toothill Report, highlighted the fact that for the industrialist a very real distance barrier exists when a one-way journey takes over three and a half-hours. I have little doubt in my own mind that this also applies to every man of business, and not just the industrialist. How ridiculous that there should be a distance barrier in our small country especially in this space age, when people have travelled round the world more quickly than we can travel from the North of Scotland to the South of England? To-day, surely, air travel is the one form of transport which can break this distance barrier.\n\n§ Never was the value of air services for business purposes brought home to me more forcibly than when it became possible for me to fly from Aberdeen to London and back home again in the same day. The service is by no means ideal, as I Shall touch on later, but it has convinced me, like many others, that air travel can open up a completely new business attitude. Previously, the ability to attend a meeting in London—which place, we must admit, has a tremendous magnetic pull for many, especially the business man—was coloured by the fact that I had to be away from the North-East of Scotland for a minimum of 39 hours. This long absence when time means so much these days, often compelled one to forgo business one would otherwise have wished to attend to.\n\n§ What then, my Lords, are the requirements to-day? First, as was pointed out in the Toothill Report, the industrialist must have suitable facilities for personal communication so as to maintain ready contact with customers and suppliers. Here let me stress that distance is not necessarily a disadvantage that cannot 1103 be surmounted, as there are counter-attractions to physical proximity to the Midlands and the South-East of England, such as freedom from congestion, more plentiful labour and cheaper rents. All these attractions might well be taken advantage of by those who live in the horribly congested areas to be found in England. But for this desirable two-way traffic to be possible, ease of communication is essential. The industrialist wants space in which to work, space to expand, and, at the same time, he must be able to contact with the least possible delay those who are vital to his industry. This usually means that he must be able to do his business and be back home at his home base—and I stress this with a certain emotion—within ten hours of leaving home. I say \"emotion\", because when one is flying from Aberdeen to London the plane leaves Aberdeen at 6.45 a.m. and one does not land back at Aberdeen until 10.20 p.m., and to that must be added time to get to and from the airport.\n\n§ Without doubt thought must also be given to those living outside the industrial belt of Scotland, and who are mainly dependent on the natural resources of the country—farming, forestry, fishing and the newer industry, tourism. Here again, personal communications are essential. Today few having Scotland at heart wish to be, or can be, completely cut off from the main centres of industry, technology and Government. Those of us like myself who have our homes in the remoter parts of the country, and who have lived there virtually all our lives, know that isolation, although very pleasant at times, does not generate big business. Here let me sound a word of warning, because often those who just visit Scotland for a short time go away with a completely misleading picture of what permanent life in those parts is like. Unfortunately, it is true to say that for most the attraction of higher reward for their labours, social attractions and ease of communication makes the drift from the remoter parts to the industrial areas go on unabated.\n\n§ When I was at the Scottish Office, I saw very vividly that once rural communities sink below a certain level, they pass the point of no return and fade 1104 altogether. Viable communities there must be, and we must not for one moment take it that the complete depopulation of the Highlands and Islands is inevitable. But it will be so unless we realise that to reverse the present trend requires essentially a vast and immediate improvement in personal communications. In Canada, important expansion is taking place outwards into the remoter parts. The sequence of events is that a natural resource is discovered, and then it is made easy for people to get to the area to be developed. This means that where distances are great, as is often the case, it is air travel which supplies the necessary communications.\n\n§ My Lords, Scotland, too, has her natural resources and the Government have done much to assist development of these. However, expansion will not take place outwards, as in Canada, until rapid communications have been provided. In the case of Scotland many natural resources have been found, but the communications are lacking. The Toothill Report, among other recommendations, laid stress on more services direct to the Continent for business men. However, while agreeing with this sentiment to some extent, I think that this is a matter of secondary importance to the provision of more and better internal services. The planning of more direct Continental services, in my view, would produce the difficulty as to where the services should be run: Paris, Rome, Cologne, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, or where? There are so many possibilities.\n\n§ We must, I think, get our priorities right over the improvements required, and I would say that, first and foremost, as was expressed by the Toothill Report, practically every industrialist or man of business should be able to meet his counterpart or contact within three and a half hours; and that means that he should have a maximum of 7 hours' travelling in a day. I think that 7 hours' travelling in a day must be regarded as a maximum, as time must be allowed for conducting business, and, in any event, the human body is not indestructible. To achieve this, people of business and others must be able to get from most areas in Scotland, except, to begin with, the very sparsely populated ones, to, say, the Midlands of England and London within three and a half hours.\n\n1105\n\n§ How is this to be put into practice? Apart from improvements to existing services, additional services will obviously have to be introduced. I need not go into details of the services required as I know that the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) have gone fully into this matter and have made, or are about to make, their recommendations to Her Majesty's Government. Suffice it to say that among the really urgent improved or additional services required are a direct service between Aberdeen and London; a link from Inverness to Edinburgh, in addition to the present Inverness—Glasgow route; improved timing of services between the Midlands of England and Inverness, and better services to Orkney and Shetland, especially to improve delivery of mail. There is also the general requirement of more and better services from Edinburgh and Glasgow to the Midlands of England.\n\n§ My Lords, there is one situation which I regard as lamentable. I refer to the plight of Dundee, which is the largest British city still without an air service. Her Majesty's Government would, I think, do well to remember that, although they are doing much to push the potential growth of Dundee's industrial estate, and also the New Town of Glenrothes, the main damping influence at present is the lack of air facilities.\n\n§ Another point is that to-day a proportion of mail is rightly carried by air. Surely, this valuable operation should be extended, not only to speed up the delivery of mail, so that centres like Aberdeen could receive London mail by the first delivery instead of, as at present, the second, but also to provide more seats for passengers, who could make use of what, in all probability, would be off-peak flights. These off-peak flights are often ideal for the tourist. For he is not usually tied in the same way as the business executive who has to make his travel arrangements at comparatively short notice and has little or no choice as to which flight is suitable. In this respect, I hope that those who make out the internal flight schedules will remember that, essentially, they should meet the exacting requirements of the business man.\n\n§ My Lords, if planes are to be able to land and take-off under almost any conditions, the vexed question of alternative runways, such as at Edinburgh, must be 1106 considered. Each runway, I know, probably costs in the region of £1 million; but let us not forget that the provision of new runways and the need to extend existing runways will not assume such importance if the Government are prepared to back the development of the civil version of the vertical take-off plane. Vertical descent greatly reduces the possibility of diversions or cancellations due to bad weather and, at the same time, reduces still further the remote, though possible, danger during landing and takeoff. Also, it must not be forgotten that operating aircraft over short distances such as on our internal services in the United Kingdom is more costly than operating on longer distances, mainly because of the high proportion of time spent in gaining height at take-off or losing height on landing, as well as the relatively short time spent cruising at a level altitude. Adding to this is the time often spent in a queue while circling, awaiting permission to land. All this, I think, points to the need for the vertical take-off plane for civil requirements, and for this development Government assistance will be essential.\n\n§ If, as I believe is essential, not only must the present growth be met but potential demand pushed, then air companies must give further serious thought as to how they are to encourage people to fly. Considerable thought must be given to many matters such as the existing arrangements for rebates provided by credit travel orders. Then I believe that much thought will have to be given to the need for an air-bus service linking the remoter parts with the existing airports—possibly amphibious helicopters might be used. This air-bus feeder service might well be operated by the independent companies, who could probably operate more cheaply than B.E.A. owing to their lower overheads. Surely, also, it would be appropriate for local authorities, familiar with local requirements and with the help of Ministry of Aviation experts, to construct landing strips or small aerodromes, since this would at least give local initiative a stake in what would be an imaginative enterprise. This is an idea, and, as Mark Twain said, the man with an idea is a crank until the idea succeeds. Let us hope that this idea will succeed, as I have no ambition to become a crank; indeed I should be doing a disservice to 1107 Scotland if I were to try to become one.\n\n§ In addition, these landing strips or small aerodromes might well be used by private aircraft; because there is obviously scope for the use of private executive aircraft, for owing to the convenience and flexibility of these private planes business is not only preserved but can be created. The main advantages of executive aircraft are a saving in time compared with ordinary air travel, convenience of being able to travel at a moment's notice, being able to work more easily during travel, a means of obtaining quickly urgent supplies or spare parts so as to maintain production, and, not least, the expansion of business made possible by increasing the amount and radius of business activity without necessarily increasing the supervisory or scientific staff.\n\n§ In the United Kingdom there are, I understand, about 150 private business aircraft, fewer, probably, per head of population than in any Common Market country. And there can be little doubt that the lack of airfield facilities has been one of the factors which has retarded this obviously very desirable growth. The businessman gave up the stage coach for the faster train. From the train many went to the more convenient car, and now the executive must use the less crowded air, where, most important, he can relax from frustration. What better lead in Scotland could be given than for the Scottish Office to own a private plane, so that the Secretary of State and the Minister of State, as well as other Ministers and senior officials, could more frequently and with greater ease visit the remoter parts of the country? Then the people in the limbs of the country would at least feel that their problems were better understood, and the resultant confidence between the outlying areas and the Scottish Office could not fail to bring lasting mutual benefit.\n\n§ Unfortunately, the people of this country cannot yet be called air-minded. However, I am certain that, given the chance, the people of Scotland will become air-minded very quickly, as there is a general realisation throughout the country that communications can solve many of Scotland's problems. Without much encouragement from the airlines, the recent increase in the 1108 number of passengers using Scottish airports has been substantial. I say \"without much encouragement\" because although B.E.A. have increased considerably their services and seat capacity—for the year 1961–62 B.E.A. carried within Scotland some 865,000 passengers, and for 1962–63 just over one million, an increase of about 16 per cent.—as always, B.E.A. increased their services when it was apparent that existing growth warranted it, although it could be strongly argued that potential demand rather than existing growth should really be the yardstick.\n\n§ To illustrate this point I must become parochial for a moment by quoting a local situation, merely because I know it well. The growth of passengers flying between Aberdeen and London is impressive; in 1961–62, London to Aberdeen and vice versa, 13,353 passengers; in 1962–63 18,736 passengers—impressive in one sense, yet in fact these figures beat no relation to the potential. I say this because the present growth could be accelerated substantially if direct services were to be introduced on this route. At present the mere fact that London planes are routed through Edinburgh and Glasgow means that it is possible to take off from Aberdeen and get stuck at Edinburgh or Glasgow. Also, there is the inconvenience of taking a longer time than is necessary. Because of the possibility of getting stuck owing to bad weather halfway, remote though this possibility is, many Aberdeen businessmen still have to use the train so as to be more certain of reaching London for their meetings on the correct day. Airlines must consider how best to meet this potential demand. Surely any successful business has to take calculated financial risks, and if the airlines cannot meet the potential demand then they must approach Her Majesty's Government to underwrite the element of risk, as both airlines and Government must ensure that the improvement to our air services on which Scottish economic growth depends is not held up.\n\n§ Then there is the difficulty of providing adequate services for the sparsely populated areas such as the Highlands and Islands. The service at present is being given by B.E.A. and is one which they claim is being financed by profits from other routes. Although competition 1109 is generally desirable, it is, I think, obvious that in this case there just is not the traffic to justify more than one operator in this area. However, if there is any question that a company is not giving the required service in the Highlands, then believe competition could and should be introduced by the Government requiring tenders from independent as well as State-owned companies for operating routes in the Highlands and Islands.\n\n§ Many will know that recently there has been mention of the desirability of a marriage of convenience between B.E.A. and its poorer, though possibly more aristocratic, relation B.O.A.C. I cannot in this debate enter into the rights or wrongs of such a merger, but there is one aspect of the matter on which I will open my mouth, and without hesitation open it widely. If a suggested merger between B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. turns out like the suggested merger between the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board and holds up progress, it will be doing nothing less than a complete disservice to Scotland and must be regarded as a tragedy for the whole of Scotland.\n\n§ Scotland needs to-day, more than anything else, urgent progress and not delaying tactics, however plausible the ultimate aim of those tactics may be. In the cases where independent companies are given a restricted licence by the Air Transport Licensing Board to operate on the same route as say B.E.A., it is only fair, I think, that the State-owned company should have some restriction placed on it. Unless this is so, the unrestricted operator could temporarily put on so many flights as to swamp the independent company out of business; and then, having forced its opponent out of business, the State-owned company could once more reduce the number of its flights.\n\n§ Once people in this country begin to become air-minded, then will be the time to introduce walk-on, walk-off services such as one finds in many parts of the United States, the principle of these services being that if you miss the first plane you get on to the next, probably in about half an hour's time. To my mind, this is an ideal form of air transport for internal services, and it is 1110 the next logical step that must be taken in the United Kingdom. Perhaps here it is as well to point out that it is not necessary to have up-to-date aircraft for this type of service, though I must quickly add that this does not mean that the planes would be any the less safe, as these planes, like any others, would still have to pass the stringent airworthiness test. The planes for a walk-on, walk-off service should be equipped to take the maximum number of passengers of just one class, an all-tourist class, and there should be no question of having to keep up with operating companies from other countries like our overseas services, as our internal services must be kept for British companies.\n\n§ I think that aircraft designers will also have to be on their toes. When I was flying, not so long ago, from London to Edinburgh in the Vanguard, one tourist passenger got on to the plane. He was slightly larger than most, and he could not sit down between the arms of the seat. That caused considerable consternation. Eventually, one of the B.E.A. stewards came up and, with the usual courtesy that one expects from B.E.A., said, \"Sir, with the compliments of B.E.A. will you please move into a first-class seat\".\n\n§ Whilst on the subject of safety, I am sure all agree that British companies are to be congratulated not only on their excellent record of safety but also on the handling of planes generally. Since credit is being given where it is due, I should not like to leave out the Ministry, who operate a number of our airports so efficiently, though I would say that no bitter tears are likely to be shed when the Ministry hand over some of the northern airports, where, most regretfully, at present no Sunday services are being operated because the operating companies find the Sunday charges required by the Ministry to be excessive. This is a great pity, as there is no doubt that there is a real requirement for a 7-day week service.\n\n§ To-day, as the result of the Beeching Report, Scotland is faced with the possibility that more of her railway lines will be closed down. But, with the remaining essential or economic lines being left, and with considerably improved air travel, Scotland can become one of the most 1111 accessible parts of the British Isles, because her airports are usually remarkably free from fog and the roads in Scotland, in general, in comparison with those in England, are not overcrowded. It is, of course, ridiculous that, in a small country such as ours, there should be any distance barrier. But there is one, and it is vital for the economic life of the country that this barrier should be removed.\n\n§ There can be no doubt that good communications are essential, not only for growth, but I would go so far as to say survival for any area. I was delighted to see reported that my noble friend the Leader of this House has in his eight-point plan of regional development for the North-East of England, the point of improvement of communications by the best use of all possible means\". This demonstrates the importance attached to good communications by not only the noble Viscount, but, I hope, Her Majesty's Government.\n\n§ There is no doubt that the wheels of progress in Scotland are turning, but something must be done to get them turning faster. To do this, new and ingenious methods must be vigorously adopted, because there is little doubt that the speed with which these new methods are adopted will determine the actual rate of growth of the Scottish economy. I have tried to give my ideas for making the pulse of Scotland beat faster. I would ask Her Majesty's Government, the airline companies, and not least the people of Scotland themselves, as all will have to play their part, to give serious thought to these ideas prescribed by me to give that stimulating tonic that Scotland so badly needs today. There is little doubt that we are on the brink of a real breakthrough as far as communications are concerned. We must, therefore, put all our efforts, as I have attempted to do, into reinforcing success because we must effectively accomplish this breakthrough.\n\n§ To sum up, a vastly improved air service would, first, stimulate the Scottish economy quicker than any other measure because it would affect most people on whom economic growth depends; secondly, it would link Scotland with the expanding economy of the Midlands and the South-East of England; and, thirdly, it would affect the whole of Scotland, including even the glens and the Highlands, doing much to arrest the rural depopula- 1112 tion. Once the right conditions have been created, Scots will not be slow to grasp the many opportunities in their country which at present have not fully matured. Exploitation of these opportunities would, I am sure, not only benefit Scotland, but would also help to relieve inflationary pressures in the Midlands and the South-East of England, and, more important still, stimulate the whole nation by making it possible to bring present idle resources in Scotland into full productive use. There is potential growth all over Scotland, and this growth can be achieved with, first and foremost, improved air services and other air facilities.
