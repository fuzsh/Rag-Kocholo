Core timetables generally change twice per year, to provide the optimal summer and winter seasonal times. We may also need to adjust our flights during the year in line with operational requirements. Our online timetable is dynamic and reflects the very latest flight times.\n\nNote: if you choose to print timetables, please be aware times may change and it is advised you check online for the most up to date schedules."
