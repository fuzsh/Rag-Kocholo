        "text": "2. RAF, RFC or RNAS?\n\nThe Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918 when the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated. Officers and men of both services who continued service after this date transferred into the newly formed RAF and were joined by new entrants. From this date onwards the RFC and RNAS ceased to exist.\n\nSomeone who served in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) or Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as well as the RAF may have service records in more than one place and you may need to consult our guides to RFC officers, RFC airmen, RNAS officers and RNAS ratings for more detail.\n\n3. Service records\n\n3.1 Airmen (not officers) 1912-1939\n\nSearch for a Royal Air Force airmans’ service records (AIR 79) on findmypast (£). These are records of airmen with service numbers from 1 to 562875. Some files may contain information from the Second World War but service records for the Second World War are still with the RAF (see section 3.2).\n\nThe records in AIR 79 usually contain the following information:\n\ndate and place of birth\n\nphysical description\n\nreligious denomination\n\nnext of kin\n\nspouse and children\n\ndate of joining\n\npromotions\n\nunits served in\n\naward of medals\n\ndate of discharge\n\nRAF service numbers between 313001 and 316000 indicate that the airmen previously served with the Royal Navy and then subsequently the Royal Naval Air Service, before transferring to the RAF. If the airman’s service number falls within this range there may be further records of his military service in Royal Naval Air Service records or Royal Navy records.\n\n3.2 Airmen (not officers) after 1939\n\nRecords of RAF airmen who served after 1939, and of men whose service numbers were above 562875 are still with the RAF. Look on the GOV.UK website to find out how to obtain service records.\n\nIt can be useful to know his service number. If you do not know his number, browse through the name indexes in AIR 78 to find it.\n\n3.3 Officers 1918-1922\n\nSearch the Royal Air Force officers’ service records 1918-1919 (£) online for officers who served in the Royal Air Force during the First World War (AIR 76). By the end of 1919, 26,000 of the 27,000 serving RAF officers had been discharged, and it is largely their service details which are held in this series.\n\n3.4 Officers after 1922\n\nRecords of RAF officers who served after 1922 are still with the RAF. Look on the GOV.UK website to find out how to obtain service records.\n\n4. Operations Record Books and Combat Reports\n\nIn the absence of a service record, or perhaps to supplement one, Operations Record Books (ORBs) can prove very revealing. These daily records of the life of a squadron, and of other units within the RAF structure, can provide insights into what an airman or officer did during their time at war. Sometimes individuals are mentioned by name, though often it is just the activities of the unit as a whole which are recorded. ORBs can also include:\n\nnominal rolls\n\nlists of officers\n\ndetails of promotions, transfers or awards\n\nAlong with combat reports, operations record books can help to tell a serviceman’s story.\n\nYou need to know which squadron a serviceman or woman served with to locate these records. Consult our Royal Air Force operations guide for detailed advice.\n\n5. RAF personnel missing in combat\n\nSearch for missing RAF personnel in AIR 81. Search these records by:\n\nsurname of missing airman\n\nplace/location of the incident in which air crew went missing\n\ndate of the incident\n\ntype of aircraft from which air crew went missing (for example, Blenheim)\n\nThese files may contain missing person and casualty action sheets, death certificates, personal letters and correspondence, exhumation reports, investigation reports, questionnaires by repatriated personnel and personal effects of POWs.\n\nPlease note that this series is still accruing and currently only goes up to December 1943.\n\n6. Medal records 1914-1922\n\n6.1 Campaign medals\n\nIf an individual in the RAF qualified for medal(s) after 1 April 1918, the only place you will find details about his medal entitlement will be on his service record.\n\n6.2 Gallantry medals\n\nFor information on gallantry medals awarded to RAF personnel, read our British military gallantry medals guide.\n\n7. Lists of RAF servicemen\n\n7.1 Muster list from 1918\n\nConsult the only complete muster roll of the RAF, compiled on its formation on 1 April 1918, on Findmypast.co.uk. The original documents are in AIR 1/819/204/4/1316 and also AIR 10/232-237.\n\n7.2 Rolls of Honour: First World War\n\nBrowse the first series of Air Historical Branch (AHB) records in series AIR 1 for nominal rolls of individual units for the First World War.\n\nIndexes and keys to AIR 1 are available with the printed version of our catalogue at The National Archives at Kew. The second series of AHB records, in AIR 5, contains little on individuals.\n\nLook at AIR 2/219, the Roll of Honour for men from the USA and Dominions who served with the British Air Forces in the First World War.\n\n7.3 Rolls of Honour: Second World War\n\nLook at AIR 14/2091, the Roll of Honour for No. 5 Group in Bomber Command. This is the only known Second World War nominal roll for the RAF in The National Archives.\n\n8. Records specific to officers\n\nRAF officer ranks include:\n\nFlying Officer\n\nFlight Lieutenant\n\nSquadron Leader\n\nWing Commander\n\nGroup Captain\n\nRecords of officers are usually held in separate sets of files to those of ordinary airmen. Some records were created only for officers, including records of commissions. The following record types may prove useful when tracing the career of an officer:\n\n8.1 The Air Force List\n\nYou can trace the commissions and promotions of an RAF officer’s career from March 1919 in the Air Force List, available at The National Archives at Kew and other specialist libraries and archives (see section 11). Up until 1938 the lists also provide details of where in the world an officer was posted.\n\nFrom 1939 there is also the Confidential Air Force List, similar to the standard Air Force List but often with slightly more detail on the specifics of an officer’s duties. Search it in the following sets of documents:\n\nfor April 1939 to 1945 in AIR 10/3814-3840\n\nfor 1946 to 1950 in AIR 10/5237-5256\n\nfor 1951 to 1953 in AIR 10/5413-5421\n\nfor 1954 in AIR 10/5581-5582\n\n8.2 Officers’ pension records 1916-1920\n\nLook in PMG 42/13-16 to find payments made to invalided RAF officers from 1917 to 1920.\n\nBrowse by reference through PMG 44 to find records of pensions paid to relatives of deceased RAF officers from 1916 to 1920.\n\nLook in PMG 43 for supplementary payments to RAF officers and their dependents from 1916 to 1920.\n\n8.3 Air Historical Branch papers\n\nFor additional material on awards and promotions, as well as officers’ correspondence, browse or search the Air Historical Branch (AHB) papers in AIR 1. Indexes and keys to AIR 1 are available with the printed version of our catalogue at The National Archives at Kew.\n\n9. Courts martial 1918-1986\n\nBrowse AIR 21 for courts martial records from 1918 to 1965. These give:\n\nname of prisoner\n\nrank of prisoner\n\nplace of trial\n\nnature of charge and sentence\n\nClick on AIR 18 and use the search box to search by surname to find the proceedings of district, general and field courts martial of officers and men from 1941 to 1986.\n\nLook in series AIR 2 and AIR 20 for records of courts martial policy.\n\n10. Prisoner of war records\n\nAir Ministry (AIR) records do not generally contain detailed information on prisoners of war. You can, however, consult:\n\na list of all aircrew known to have been held prisoner by Germany in AIR 20/2336\n\nescape reports and related files in AIR 40\n\nprisoner of war and internees’ files in FO 916\n\nSee also our guides to British prisoners of war c1790-1919 and British prisoners of the Second World War and the Korean War.\n\n11.
