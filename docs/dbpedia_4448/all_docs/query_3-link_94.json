It's time again to get out the salmon form charts for past years, study previous pack figures and enter your estimate of the 1961 salmon pack. There's S75 to win, $15 to place and $10 to show. These are the prizes being offered by The Fisherman in its seventeenth annual salmon pack guessing contest, which always presents a challenge to those of our readers who figure they can come up with the right answer. As proof of how accurately some of them can estimate we have Florence Maryschuk of Richmond, shoreworker member of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union, who has taken the first prize for the past two years. In 1959 her estimate was less than 13,000 cases off the actual figure and last year her guess was 32,000 cases out. This year's deadline for entries in the Seventeenth Annual Salmon Pack Guessing Contest is midnight Sunday, August 27. Last minute entries must be postmarked with that date to qualify. The rules are simple. The contest is open to all readers, but there is a limit of one entry to each contestant. Contestants have only to answer the following question on the coupon below: How many 48 pound cases of salmon of all species do you think will be canned in British Columbia this season? The following facts on previous packs may be of some assistance in making an estimate: YEAR 19S0 No. of Cases 632,089 1959 .............. .........._............._______________ 1,089,799 1958.........................................................................._______________....... 1,908,056 1957 ............................................................................................ 1,437,642 1956 .................:........................................._....._........................... 1,112,830 1955 1954 1953 • '■ 52 1951 1950 1,406,230 1,743,406 1,821,269 1,286,468 1,955,475 1,482,560'/2 NOTE; Pack figures aie unrevised as issued at the end of each year on which contest results are based. {all to: THE FISHERMAN 158 East Cordova Street. Vancouver 4, B.C. ENTRY FORM I think the total salmon pack in 1961 will be NAME ADDRESS cases RECORD TRIP In what Prince Rupert Co-op officials claim is the largest halibut trip to be landed in Prince Rupert since the days of dory fishing half a century ago, the new combination vessel Northern Dawn delivered 165,000 pounds to the Co-op July 24. Skipper of the Northern Dawn is Johnny Johnson, who brought in a record 179,000 pounds of halibut on the Silver Bounty on June 13 last year. But a deckload of 29,000 was dropped off at Sandpoint on the way in, so that the actual landing at Prince Rupert was 150,000 pounds. On May 17 this year the Blue Pacific 1 set a new single trip record for Vancouver with a landing of 160,500 pounds of halibut. Danger to Fraser Seen Export of Power Opposed by Labor In a submission made to the Bennett government before the opening of the legislature this week, the BC Federation of Labor took a strong stand against export of power. Export of power means export of jobs, Federation secretary Pat O'Neal told Premier W. A. C. Bennett in a letter, pointing out that power supplied by British Columbia to enable industry to expand in the US Northwest would be detrimental to economic development in British Columbia itself. Supporting take-over of the BC Electric in principle, the Federation declared that the government should not impose on the people of this province the unrealistic paper values of stocks and shares of the BC Electric and the Peace River Power Development Company. Power Development Company, the only fair basis lor take-over was payment for survey work actually done. COMMUNIST VIEW Communist provincial leader Nigel Morgan, commenting on the government's take-over of the BC Electric and Peace River Power Development Company, pointed out that his party had campaigned consistently over the years for public ownership of all power resources and development, chief among them the BC Electric. Any takeover should be based on past sound appraisals of the BC Electric's assets by the Public Utilities Commission, the Federation added. Fishing Cut to On Johnstone Th Strait Days Pinks Concern over the degree of exploitation and its effect on escapement is given by the fisheries department as its reason for reducing fishing time in the Johnstone Strait pink salmon fishery to three days a week, commencing 6 p.m., Wednesday, August 2, in the whole of Areas 12 and 13. Light Spring Reported at Light troll spring landings, below those even of last year at this time, were reported from Vancouver, Steveston and Victoria last week, the 253,000 pounds total landing comparing with 243,000 pounds two weeks ago and 419.000 pounds for the corresponding week of 1960. Prices for 11,000 pounds direct landings were: large red 68-70 Landings All Ports Crewman Injures Leg on Seiner A 24-year old crew member of the C. F. Todd, Allan Glenden-ning, was flown from Bella Bella to Vancouver on Tuesday this week for treatment of leg injuries he received in an accident aboard the seiner the previous night. Glendenning, a new member of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union, reportedly mangled his leg when it became caught in the vessel's drive shaft. After receiving treatment in the hospital at Bella Bella, he was flown to Vancouver in a BC Airlines plane from Port Hardy. cents; medium red 50 cents; small red 40 cents; large white 45 cents; small white 30 cents. Gillnet prices at Steveston were 35-40 cents for red and 25-30 cents for white springs. Coho landings totalled 799.000 pounds as compared with 780.000 pounds the previous week and 407,000 pounds tor the same week last year. At Prince Rupert, troll spring landings were' 45,000 pounds, large red bringing 62 cents for direct landings, medium red 48 cents, small red 37 cents, large white 40 cents and small white 30 cents. Troll coho landings totalled 157,-000 pounds, of which 149,000 pounds represented direct landings by 110 trollers at 38-39 cents a pound. Gillnet landings of spring salmon consisted of 8,000 pounds of red and 5,000 pounds of white. Direct landings of dressed fish were priced at 46 cents for red and 25 cents for white. Landings of 35,474 pounds of dogfish livers last week brought total landings under the current federal dogfish subsidy program to 570,078 pounds. An information letter issued over the signature of Pacific area director W. R. Hourston also warns that it may be necessary \"to further reduce the fishing time by an additional day in Area 13 during the week of August 13-19.\" Reasons for the department's decisions, as set out in Hourston's letter, follow: A special committee of senior departmental personnel in British Columbia in consultation with scientists of the Fisheries Research NS Net Lift Time Slashed Commercial salmon fishermen in what are termed the exposed portions of the coast of Nova Scotia have been permitted to reduce to one week, the two-week period when they were required to lift their nets. Fisheries minister J. A. Mac-Lean, in a recent announcement, declared that he decided on the shorter lift period after representations by commercial Atlantic salmon fishermen that ice conditions and bad weather would drastically reduce available fishing. The reduced lift period of from July 1 to July 8 for commercial set nets fishing Atlantic salmon took effect in the exposed portions of Nova Scotia coast in the Bay of Fundy area from Cape Sable westward, northward and eastward off Shelburne, Yarmouth, Digby, Annapolis, Kings, Hants, Colchester and Cumberland counties. .Previously the lift period in these areas was from July 1 to July 15. The lift period for other exposed portions of the Nova Scotia coast other than those mentioned was set at from June 16 to June 23. Under present regulations, the Atlantic salmon net fishermen were required to lift their nets in these areas from June 16 until the end of the month. One In Every Four Rescues Fishermen Rescue operations involving fishing vessels off the coasts of Britain accounted for 23 percent of all lifeboat launchings last year, according to annual report of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Board from Nanaimo has undertaken in recent months a complete review of the stocks of pink salmon contributing to the fishery in Johnstone Strait. Study has included analysis of pink salmon catches and escapements since 1950. The information on the timing of runs, their destinations, migration routes and rates of exploitation obtained as a result of the 1959 pink salmon tagging program in this area were of particular value in this review. 1959 ESCAPEMENT In general, the data indicate that due to the two-week salmon fishing strike late in July and early in August of 1959, satisfactory escapements of the earlier running pinks were obtained. These included such areas as upper Johnstone Strait, Howe Sound and Jervis Inlet. The runs which migrated through Johnstone Strait in the two week period following the strike were, however, subjected to intensive exploitation. ( The spawning escapements from these runs were fairly adequate in the mainland inlets of Areas 12 but were at extremely low levels in the important mid- \"The government's action, motivated by Premier Bennett's desire to strengthen his hand in efforts to get a permit to drain off BC hydro resources for US monopolies, and to get even with Ottawa for reducing British Columbia's In the case of the Peace River j return under the new rental tax agreement, nevertheless represents an important step forward,\" he said in a statement. \"It will increase the pressure, however, on the National Energy Board for power exports, which if allowed could quickly endanger the Fraser River fisheries. Power exports would increase the pressure for construction of the Moran Dam in order to satisfy US demands for power.\" Morgan said the Communist Party would campaign for the real benefits of public ownership to be passed on to the people in the form of lower light, gas and transit rates and would oppose excessive compensation for the BC Electric. He said that existing trade union agreements affected by the takeover should be upheld and the trade unions and municipalities should be given representation on the new BC Electric directorate. Vancouver Island streams and in certain portions of Toba Inlet. Information on the time of passage of these latter runs through the Straits indicates that they commence during the first week of August and peak late in the second week and early in the third week of the month. EXPLOITATION RATE While the data on the exploitation rate in Areas 12 and 13 have not been fully analysed, preliminary evidence suggests that it can exceed 70 percent during a four-day fishing week for pinks. Under such circumstances it is obvious that adequate escapement cannot be secured. Action is accordingly being taken to reduce the fishing time in the whole of Areas 12 and 13 to three days per week commencing Wednesday, August 2, until further notice. Depending upon developments in the runs, it may also be found necessary to further reduce the fishing time by an additional day in Area 13 during the week of August 13-19. All factors bearing on the fishery will be kept under close review and the industry will be further advised in this regard by August 10. Two Shipyard Workers Burned in Explosion Two shipyard workers were burned about the hands and face at Celtic Shipyards, Vancouver, on July 22 when an explosion aboard a gillnetter in which they were installing a new engine hurled them out on deck. ---■*> The men, Les Thomas of Rich- UK FISHERIES MINISTRY OUT The British government will not create a separate ministry of fisheries. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan made this statement in the House of Commons last month in replying to a request made by Hector Hughes, a Scottish MP. Hughes proposed that fisheries be separated from agriculture and raised to a full ministry \"in view of the failure of the government's efforts to achieve international agreement on disputes relating to fishing in territorial waters.\" Macmillan held that nothing would be gained by such an administrative change. couver, were taken to hospital fo treatment. Thomas said he pressed the starter button of the newly in stalled engine \"and there was a boom that rocked the office on shore and blew us out on deck A leak in a gas line is believed to have caused the explosion. Although the cabin was wrecked damage to the boat, owned by Chief William Scow of Alert Bay, was estimated this week at less than $1,000. Pinks Caught Off Scotland Only one instance of a pink salmon being taken in Scottish waters last summer has officially been recorded, John Maclay, secretary of state for Scotland, informed the British House of Commons recently in written answer to a question. Maclay added, however, that there had been four other unconfirmed reports of pink salmon being taken in Scottish waters and one of a pink being taken by rod ?.nd line in the Derwent River, near Wokington, Cumberland, in northwest England. \"My scientists report that the appearance of these fish in our waters is probably the result of the transfer in recent years of large numbers of Pacific salmon eggs, chiefly pink salmon, to the rivers of the Kola Peninsula of northern Russia, which flow into the northeast Atlantic,\" Maclay stated.
