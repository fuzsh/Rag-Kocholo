Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nNevertheless, Russell L. Ray, the company's president and CEO, described Pan Am as \"an airline whose name will be forever forged in American history.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPan Am now serves as a symbol of a bygone era of luxurious air travel. Scroll down to see what its glory days looked like:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlying with Pan Am was a luxurious experience that meant wearing some of your finest clothes ‚Äî and being served refreshments far from your assigned seat.\n\nSome airlines now still have a separate lounge, like the economy and business classes in the Airbus A380 plane.\n\nBut it's a much rarer experience in the air now.\n\nThat being said, the cabin seats also provided plenty of space, and service, for when you were there. Here's what it was like to get served Champagne in the first-class cabin of a Boeing 747.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe staff was trained to provide this service. This photo, taken around 1960, shows crew practising serving meals at the Pan American World Airways stewardess school in Long Island.\n\nOn real flights, what was served on board included tea and coffee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeats were quite roomy in economy too. This is the economy class of a Boeing 707 plane in 1958.\n\nPersonal space seems to have been key to Pam Am's vision for the skies ‚Äî here's what a mock-up model of a Boeing 707 Stratoliner cabin looked like around 1957.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildren often took advantage of the space too.\n\nTechnology may not have been as advanced as it is now, but there was still entertainment on board, with shared screens placed high up above people's seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany planes had an upper deck, accessed by a spiral staircase.\n\nSome of the most luxurious spaces were in the airline's Flying Clipper Ships ‚Äî a type of aircraft that no longer flies today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what the main cabin of a Clipper was like around 1936.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe airline operated many routes, and its advertisements showed how its reach made the planet a \"small world.\"\n\nThe cabin crew's uniform was also iconic, and their lives were considered deeply glamorous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's a group of flight attendants posing at the Aeropuerto Los Cerrillos in Santiago, Chile, around 1947.\n\nThey also got to work alongside some of the world's biggest celebrities. Here are the Beatles about to fly with Pan Am from London to America in 1964.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe airline's terminal at New York International Airport ‚Äî now known as JFK ‚Äî also became a special destination in its own right. It became somewhere people would enjoy fine dining and watch planes take off.\n\nSource: Forbes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this glory was not to last forever. The airline was ultimately brought down by a combination of a weak US economy, rising fuel costs, and various public-relations hits. It filed for bankruptcy in January 1991, and ultimately closed that December.\n\nAmong its problems was the public relations nightmare that accompanied the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, when Pan Am Flight 103 was destroyed with a bomb as it flew over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.\n\nAll 243 passengers and 16 crew died.\n\nThe airline filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1991, and struggled on for a few months before folding suddenly that December.\n\n\"Today we see the end of an airline whose name will be forever forged in American history,\" Russell L. Ray, the company's president and CEO, said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPan Am's terminal in New York was also ultimately demolished between 2013 and 2014, long after the airline closed.\n\nSource: Untapped Cities\n\nRead next\n\nair travel\n\nAdvertisement"
