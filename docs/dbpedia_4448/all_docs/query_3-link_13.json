        "text": "UK passenger lists do not record travel within Europe unless a ship called at more than one European port before travelling further afield.\n\nThe transportation of military troops was not recorded in passenger lists.\n\nPassenger lists are not held by The National Archives after 1960, when air travel became more common. No air passenger lists have survived. For records of passengers after 1960 it may be worth contacting the relevant shipping line.\n\nYour search will be made easier if you can find out:\n\nthe name and year of birth of the passenger\n\nthe name of the ship they travelled on\n\nthe ports of departure and/or arrival\n\nIncoming passenger lists (1878-1960)\n\nSearch and download lists of passengers arriving in the UK on ships that departed from ports outside Europe and the Mediterranean, though lists include passengers who joined ships at European and Mediterranean ports en route to the UK, between 1878 and 1960 (BT 26) on the Ancestry.co.uk (£) website.\n\nOutgoing passenger lists (1890-1960)\n\nSearch and download (£) lists of passengers boarding at UK and Irish ports and travelling to places such as America, Canada, India, New Zealand and Australia between 1890 and 1960 (BT 27) on the findmypast.co.uk website and also on the Ancestry.co.uk website.

The records can be searched by name of alien, date and port of arrival and country/place of origin.\n\nAliens’ entry books (1794-1921)\n\nBrowse aliens’ entry books, 1794-1921, including indexes to certificates of alien arrivals (HO 5/25-28) on ancestry.co.uk (£).\n\nHamburg passenger lists 1850-1934\n\nSearch and browse passenger lists of ships leaving Hamburg in Germany on Ancestry.com (£). Although most passengers travelled beyond Europe, a significant number sailed to the UK. The records are in German.\n\nTo access these records you will either need to visit us, pay for research (£) or, where you can identify a specific record reference, order a copy (£).\n\nRecords of the Children’s Overseas Reception Board (1940-1959)\n\nSearch Discovery, our catalogue, in DO 131 by name for case histories of all the CORB children evacuated overseas during the Second World War.\n\nName\n\nPassenger lists and records in overseas libraries and archives\n\nContact libraries, archives and other organisations in the country where the person travelled to or from – many have copies of original material.
