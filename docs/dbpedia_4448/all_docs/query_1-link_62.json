        "text": "Application process\n\nAt NATS we recruit and train people to become valid Air Traffic Controllers and support our operation. The path to becoming a Controller is not a quick and easy one. It takes time and commitment but the rewards at the end make it all worth while.\n\nAn overview of the steps you need to follow to qualify is laid out below.\n\nOn joining as a Trainee Air Traffic Controller Apprentice, you’ll get a basic salary of £21,330.60*, along with an attractive benefits package. This will include everything from a market-leading contributory pension scheme and generous annual leave to a whole host of voluntary benefits and family friendly policies.\n\nBecause we recognise the costs associated with accommodation when you’re training, we also provide an annual accommodation allowance which is paid monthly whilst you remain an Ab Initio Trainee. The monthly accommodation allowance is equivalent to £8,351.91* per annum.\n\nOnce you’ve completed and passed all of your training (college and unit), your salary will rise to £46,216 - £51,508* and, with increments, you could potentially earn over £100,000* (inclusive of shift pay) at some of our busiest units.\n\nOur standard annual leave arrangements are 28 days per year plus public holidays. More detailed information on benefits will be provided when you join us.\n\n*At 2024 rates."
