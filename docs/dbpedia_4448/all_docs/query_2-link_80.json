        "text": "Exports and Imports are a series of side-missions in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which becomes available after \"Customs Fast Track\" for Cesar Vialpando. Similar to Grand Theft Auto III's Import/Export feature, Exports and Imports consists of a series of vehicle deliveries for money, as well as the ability to purchase any of the vehicles delivered.\n\nDescription[]\n\nTo \"export\" or sell a vehicle, the player must obtain a \"wanted\" vehicle (as shown when the player is told via an on-screen message: \"You can export this vehicle over at Easter Basin Docks.\") and take it to a specific marker on a cargo ship in Easter Basin, San Fierro, where it can be lifted in place via a magnetic dockside crane, or simply driven up a ramp linking the dock to the deck of the ship if the vehicle is compact enough to be driven onto the ship. Once the vehicle is in contact of the marker (and released from the crane magnet, if lifted using the crane), a message will show up that the player has successfully exported that vehicle. The player will then receive money depending on the type and condition of the vehicle.\n\nTo \"import\" or buy a vehicle, the player simply needs to walk up to the board in Easter Basin and select which vehicle they would like to import. Vehicles are only unlocked for importing after they have been successfully exported. The player can only import certain selections of vehicles depending on the day of the week, the lists being based mainly on the order in which the player had exported them.\n\nExporting all 30 wanted vehicles is a requirement for 100% completion.\n\nWanted Lists[]\n\nEach wanted list consists of ten different vehicles needed for export, ranging from motorbikes and regular sedans to off-roaders and sports cars.\n\nPlayers have the option of either plucking a vehicle that spawns normally in traffic or parking space, or locate one specifically spawned in one spot when they are requested in the list. Note that vehicles will only spawn at certain locations if it is currently on a list; for example, the Euros will only spawn at The Camel's Toe if the player is on the third list of cars and has not exported a Euros already.\n\nWanted vehicles that are specifically spawned usually have custom license plates.\n\nThe max rewards are dependent on the monetary value of the vehicle set in the Handling.cfg file. The maximum amount of money that can be made from this side-mission is $1,444,000, with $‭1,094,000‬ being the reward for exporting all thirty vehicles in mint condition, i.e. without incurring any damage to the vehicles, and another $350,000 total as bonuses for completing all three lists.\n\nList 1[]\n\nVehicle Image Max reward Notable locations Admiral $35,000\n\nDoherty, San Fierro or Queens.\n\nSpawns across from the Los Santos Conference Center in the Papercuts parking lot (when wanted for export).\n\nExists in Firefighter and Vigilante missions.\n\nBuffalo $35,000\n\nSpawns at Catalina's Hideout in Fern Ridge (always).\n\nAt the Xoomer gas station in Easter Basin (when wanted for export).\n\nCamper $26,000\n\nSpawns atop of Mount Chiliad.\n\nA vehicle storage lot in Hashbury (always)\n\nAt the parking lot of the diner in Juniper Hollow, San Fierro (when wanted for export).\n\nFeltzer $35,000\n\nVank Hoff Hotel, San Fierro in Valet side mission or in Downtown, Los Santos.\n\nCan be found parked at a highway rest stop in southeast Flint County, near Back o' Beyond (when wanted for export).\n\nAlso parked in a parking lot at the Santa Maria Freeway Extension.\n\nSometimes spawns in Easter Basin.\n\nInfernus $95,000\n\nSometimes driving around in Richman, Los Santos; Paradiso, San Fierro or in Prickle Pine, Las Venturas.\n\nAlso can be found parked outside of a house in Paradiso (when wanted for export).\n\nPatriot $40,000\n\nCan be found at Easter Basin Naval Base and Area 69 (always - triggers a 5 star wanted level) and parked at Easter Bay Chemicals (when wanted for export).\n\nRarely exists in firefighter missions.\n\nRemington $30,000\n\nOften driven on the country roads.\n\nAt Unity Station in Los Santos, where the player can find the Lowrider Challenge (when wanted for export).\n\nAlso common in southern Los Santos.\n\nSanchez $10,000\n\nIn an alleyway in Hashbury, east of the San Fierro courier mission starting point, or Hunter Quarry (always).\n\nParked behind the dust-bin on the right side of No. 1 Desert Home Furnishings store in Angel Pine (when wanted for export)\n\nCan also be found parked at Easter Bay Chemicals.\n\nIf the house (farm) in Whetstone is bought, the bike can appear there.\n\nSentinel $35,000\n\nParked next to the offices in the back of a filming studio in Vinewood (when wanted for export).\n\nSometimes driven in Doherty, San Fierro.\n\nStretch $40,000\n\nIn Vinewood and Richman.\n\nBehind the Wang Cars showroom, right next to a race entry marker (when wanted for export).\n\nAlso can be spawned by cheat.\n\nThe maximum amount of money that can be earned for importing all vehicles on this list in mint condition is $381,000.

Being required to exit the vehicle, the player will inevitably receive fall damage, depending on how high the magnet is positioned.\n\nTake a car from traffic with a Tow Truck while an NPC is still in it and lift that car with the crane, and in the cutscene where the car is being delivered, the car will just drive away. The car will still be exported though.\n\nThere is a glitch that causes the game to crash when the player approaches the docks area for the Exports/Imports mission (see video for more details). This happens due to the possibility that the \"Wanted\" list blackboard object may have the same handle as the traffic cones used for the Driving and Bike schools, which will be removed whenever a school test is finished. Although the chance of handle coincidence is very low, it is advised to complete the export list before attempting the schools if one wishes to achieve 100% completion of the game.\n\nImported vehicles can be \"marked\", which means they will not despawn even if parked anywhere for more than three minutes or if they are within the Clear Area radius of a mission (the Beat the Cock! races have a huge Clear Area radius that reaches the whole map, which makes all \"unmarked\" vehicles despawn). To mark a vehicle, first import it as normal, then grab the imported vehicle with the crane and lift it above the ship, but do not move the vehicle away from it. Now, while the vehicle is attached to the magnet, while still facing the vehicle with the camera (this is important, as otherwise the vehicle despawns), exit the gate and enter it again. The easiest way to achieve this is using a jetpack. If one goes far enough, then a vehicle may be imported again. Go back to the blackboard while still keeping the vehicle attached to the magnet within camera view and import a new vehicle. Now, operate the crane and place the vehicle attached to the magnet outside the ship. This vehicle should now be \"marked\". The only way to get rid of a \"marked\" vehicle is to either blow it up, after which it despawns like a normal vehicle, or, on some versions, to save and then load the game. However, if one is playing on the mobile, PS3, Xbox 360, Windows Store or The Definitive Edition versions of the game, \"marked\" vehicles will be saved and still be available after loading the save. So, on these versions, this is a way to save a vehicle outside garages.\n\nThere is a glitch that allows the player to export vehicles that are not on the \"Wanted\" list blackboard, which makes that vehicle available for importing. The glitch can be done by entering the gate to the import/export area while on a mission – or the game thinking that a mission is active, for example while the phone is ringing – and parking a vehicle that is on the \"Wanted\" list at the delivery spot. The vehicle will not be delivered if they entered the area while on a mission. The player should then get a vehicle that is not on the \"Wanted\" list, cancel or fail the mission, and enter the import/export area again; the game will now accept vehicles for exporting. The vehicle not on the list must be driven to the export delivery spot, and the vehicle that is on the list should still be parked there. While driving the vehicle not on the list, the player should either bump into the other vehicle or shoot it with a weapon. If done correctly, the vehicle will be delivered, but the player will gain no money, and the vehicle that will be available for importing is the vehicle that they are currently driving/riding and not the vehicle that got delivered.\n\nVehicles that are normally not available for importing will have their name glitched, either displaying the same name of the last unglitched vehicle checked and costing 80% of its monetary value for importing, or having a blank name if no unglitched vehicle has yet been displayed and costing nothing. The only known exception for this is the NRG-500, which will always have its name displayed correctly.\n\nSince doing this does not remove any vehicle from the \"Wanted\" list blackboard, it means the player can have more that 30 vehicles exported in their stats, as this can be done indefinitely, but the player is still limited to 30 vehicles that they can add to the import list, even if the stat is higher.\n\nSee Also[]"
