He enjoyed cooking Southwestern and Creole food, listening to Janis Joplin and Joe Crocker, and he joked with a dry wit.\n\nRenée began her early formative years in rural upstate New York. She had worked for American Airlines since 1986 as a flight attendant. She was fascinated with people and their cultures, customs and everyday life. She also was affected by the importance that nature has in all aspects of historic and contemporary Asia. All of this culminated in her great love of and respect for the many wonders found in the museums around the world, and her desire to share her knowledge and experiences with others. She loved to travel and she loved art. She worked as a docent at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, not far from the 150-year-old row house she shared with her cat, Cheyenne, in the city's Federal Hill section.

September 11 is a culmination of several elevenths for Odessa: she entered this life on the 11th, got married on the 11th, anticipated a joyous celebration of her 25th anniversary on the 11th, and died on the 11th. She gave of herself freely; she even honed her skills to volunteer as a financial counselor to others.

Christopher was a successful businessman and world traveler who loved the performing arts and music, the game of golf, and any home improvement project he could find. But perhaps his most important accomplishment, the identity he would tell you he was most proud of, was that of a loving, devoted family man.

His last three years, he worked for the Science Applications International Corporation as a Systems Administrator at the U.S. Navy Command Center in the Pentagon.\n\nFrom very early childhood, there was no question about Noeth’s talent. He was “a painter.” Drawing and painting before he could talk, his first formal art training only began when, as a junior in high school, he enrolled in special classes at the world-renowned Art Students League in New York City. Always intrigued as well by ships and the sea, it was an easy decision to enlist in the Navy as soon as he earned his Fine Arts degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology.

As Barbara’s Los Angeles-bound jetliner hurtled instead toward the Pentagon, she speed-dialed her husband, U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and told him how terrorists had taken over the plane.
