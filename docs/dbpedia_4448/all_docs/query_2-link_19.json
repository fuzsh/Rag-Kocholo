Kennedy was one of the shortest in U.S. history (clocking in at marginally over a thousand days) but remains one of the most popular by public opinion.\n\nAfter being inaugurated in January 1961, marked by his now-legendary “Ask not what your country can do for you” address, JFK’s first year in office brought numerous significant events in history, from the establishment of the Peace Corps and the “Alliance for Progress”, to the advancement of the Civil Rights movement, and perhaps most notably the official beginning of American involvement in the Vietnam war.\n\nKennedy’s legacy remains substantial not merely for his actions as Commander-in-Chief, but also due to his notorious private life, as well as the eternally debatable circumstances surrounding his assassination in November 1963.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nThe Space Race\n\nWhile the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union could be said to have begun verbally in 1955, 1961 oversaw an explosion in activity, and the largest forward steps for both nations, prior to the giant leap that would take place at the end of the decade.\n\nAfter success on both sides with all manner of animals, most recently with an American ape at the beginning of the year, in April the Soviets made a household name of cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, as he became the first human being ever to visit outer space.\n\nAmerica would follow suit less than a month later, but this was a battle that had already been won. In response, President Kennedy promised to win the war, by placing an American man on the moon by the end of the decade. The Americans would of course achieve this in 1969 with the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nThe Berlin Crisis\n\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 began in earnest at the Vienna summit in June, with an ultimatum from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev informed President Kennedy of the USSR’s intention to sign a peace treaty with East Germany, with or without American approval. Kennedy disagreed with the unilateral aspect of the proposal on the grounds of its conflict with the four-power agreement signed at the conclusion of World War II.\n\nThe potential permutations of the lack of overall progress made at the summit would become clearer the following month with Kennedy’s speech outlining plans for bomb shelters should the Soviet Union prompt a nuclear war with their involvement in Berlin.\n\nUltimately, tensions would culminate on August 13, with the erection of barbed wire and fences by East German troops forming the first segment of what would eventually become the Berlin Wall.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
