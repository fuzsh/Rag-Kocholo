        "text": "1. Overview\n\nThis leaflet tells you about going through Customs when entering Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) in the United Kingdom (UK). There are different rules for travellers entering Northern Ireland (NI), these can be found on the Travelling to the UK page.\n\nThis leaflet details what you are and are not allowed to bring in, and your allowances for different types of goods below which you do not have to pay tax and/or duty.\n\nWe have a duty to protect the UK from drugs, firearms and other harmful goods and to stop smugglers evading taxes. This includes goods that travellers should pay UK tax and duty on. To do this, we need your help and co-operation. If we stop you and ask you about your baggage, please co-operate. We may stop you to ask questions, make checks and if you break the rules, seize your goods (including any vehicle you use to transport them).\n\n1.1 Don’t risk it all\n\nIf you get caught smuggling goods or selling goods you did not declare, you could face prosecution and imprisonment. If we are satisfied that the goods are for a commercial purpose and you have not declared them, we may seize them and any vehicle used to transport them, and may not return them to you. If you are unsure about the goods you are carrying for your personal use, you can find more information and make an online declaration from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC Online Service for Passengers.\n\nIf you are carrying commercial goods, please visit the goods in baggage guidance.\n\nIf you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival on: 0300 322 9434 Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm. Make your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.\n\n2. Going through customs\n\nMost of our ports and airports have two exits or ‘channels’: the red and green channel. Some ports and airports only have one exit and a red point phone where you can declare goods. If you let a coach, ferry, train or aircraft store your goods while travelling to the UK, you must make sure you collect the exact goods obtained by you and go through the correct channel.\n\n2.1 Green channel\n\nUse the green channel if you are travelling with goods that:\n\ndo not go over your allowances\n\nare not banned or restricted\n\nhave been declared using the Online Service for Passengers\n\nhave been declared using the Merchandise in Baggage Online Declaration Service\n\ncash that has been declared using the online form.\n\n2.2 Red channel or red point phone\n\nYou must use the red channel or the red point phone if you are arriving and you:\n\nhave personal goods or cash to declare\n\nhave commercial goods to declare\n\nyou need to make a declaration\n\n3. Travelling to the UK from another country\n\nYou can bring in goods up to the limits below without paying UK duty and/or tax. These goods must be for your own use or intended as gifts.\n\nIf you intend to sell or accept any kind of payment for the goods you bring in then this is classed as commercial use.\n\nDetails of your allowances are set out in the following pages.\n\nIf you have any goods that exceed these allowances, you will need to make a declaration and pay tax and duties due on the full amount of goods in the category or categories exceeded. You can check allowance details, make a declaration, and pay any tax and duty due from 72 hours in advance of arrival using the HMRC Online Service for Passengers.\n\nIf you need assisted digital support to make your declaration call HMRC from 72 hours in advance of arrival: 0300 322 9434 Monday to Friday 8am to 6pm.\n\nMake your declaration ahead of arrival where possible, however, outside these hours of service, please use the red point phone or red channel.\n\nIf you have made a declaration at duty free goods and have nothing further to declare, you can use the Green Channel when going through customs. You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to see this.\n\nIf you do not declare goods exceeding these limits, then we may seize all of the goods you are carrying within that allowance category, not just those that exceed the allowance.\n\nPassengers transferring at a UK airport should check the security rules on the carriage of liquids (including duty free) purchased at airports outside the UK as these items may not be permitted through the security search point on transfer.\n\nFurther information can be found on the GOV.UK website.\n\n4. Alcohol and tobacco\n\nYou are allowed to bring in the following without paying UK duty and/or tax:\n\n4.1 Alcohol\n\nEither 4 litres of spirits and other liquors over 22% ABV (alcohol by volume), or 9 litres of alcoholic drinks less than 22% ABV. Alcoholic drinks less than 22% ABV include cider, sparkling wine and fortified wine (for example port or sherry).\n\nYou may combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total alcohol allowance. For example, you could bring 4.5 litres of cider and 2 litres of spirits (both half of your allowance). Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.\n\nIn addition, you may also bring back 42 litres of beer and 18 litres of still wine.\n\n4.2 Tobacco\n\n200 cigarettes, or 100 cigarillos, or 50 cigars, or 250g of tobacco (including shisha tobacco) or 200 sticks of tobacco for heating.\n\nYou can combine these allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example, if you only bring back 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200), you may also bring back 25 cigars (50% of the full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.\n\nAll references to tobacco products include herbal smoking products. The allowance on cigarettes includes all types of cigarettes – normal, herbal or a combination of both.\n\nPlease note that you cannot combine your alcohol and tobacco allowances. For example: you cannot bring more alcohol back if you do not bring any tobacco.\n\nAlcohol and tobacco allowances are only available to those aged 17 and over. This means if you are under 17 and bring back any of these goods you must pay tax and duty on the full amount.\n\n5.

You should retain the reference number and your email receipt for your declaration as Border Force officers may ask to check this email.\n\n6. Food and plants\n\nFrom most countries outside the EU, you are not allowed to bring in any meat, honey or dairy products (except infant milk or special foods required for medical reasons, also not exceeding 2kg).
