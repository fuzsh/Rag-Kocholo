        "text": "What to do with the independent airframe firms\n\nIn 1948 ITTL they were.\n\nAuster Aircraft (IOTL the Firm & F.G. Miles (founded 1951) became part of Beagle in 1962 which in 1969 called in the Receiver & closed in 1970).\n\nBoulton Paul Aircraft (IOTL ceased own aircraft design in late 1950 & became part of Dowty Group in 1961)\n\nHandley Page (IOTL went into liquidation 1970)\n\nMiles Aircraft (IOTL went into liquidation 1947 and assets acquired by Handley Page - became H.P. Reading)\n\nScottish Aviation (IOTL was nationalised in 1977 and became part of British Aerospace)\n\nShort Brothers (state owned since 1943 & IOTL merged with Short & Harland in 1948 to become Short Brothers & Harland)\n\nMiles has the M.52 which isn't cancelled ITTL and Wood had it taken over by one of the new groups on the condition that it retained its identity as a division of the firm. As I'm following Wood's Scenario 1945 we also have the German team, which ultimately absorbs into one of the new unified industry groups. So does Miles join BAC and the German team join HS or does the German team join BAC and Miles join HS? BAC is probably the firm that builds the Spectre ITTL as its built to an alternative version of Spec. F.23/49 and IOTL English Electric built the Lightning to it. Is Miles or the German team the one that would have been of the greatest help in producing that.\n\nAuster made light aircraft, Boulton Paul's main aircraft was the Balliol trainer and Scottish Aviation made light aircraft, trainers and small twin engine aircraft. Maybe these firms should be encouraged to merge.\n\nAs far as I know Handley Page tried to join Hawker Siddeley in 1963, but they couldn't agree terms. As the Vulcan was developed by a firm that became part of Hawker Siddeley and HP did the Victor the logical thing to me is for it to join BAC in 1948 ITTL.\n\nThat leaves Short Brothers & Harland. An alternative to having Hawker Siddeley join BAC is to have it join Short Brothers. How well did Frederick Handley Page get on with Oswald Short? Both firms built Canberras, a medium bomber and transport aircraft in the 1950s & 1960s. Maybe there's some synergy to be had.\n\nIn the Wesworld naval role-playing game/forum, I came up with a rationalised industry in the 1930s-40s. I don't offer this as a complete solution (because that setting had a ITTL beginning in 1917) but as where my thoughts were on this subject a decade ago and which are applicable to this scenario in terms of scale of workload and possible trends.\n\nI made three main 'conglomerates' and some smaller groups as follows.\n\nHawker Siddeley Group\n\nSince its formation in September 1935 the Hawker Siddeley Group has been the largest and of the “Big Three” conglomerates in the British aeronautical industry. It controls the interests of four aircraft manufacturers and one aero engine manufacturer and owns a large portion of the nation’s aviation private R&D facilities. Since 1935 centralisation has been increasing, this year (1949) the Hawker Siddeley Group has been reorganised.\n\nHawker Siddeley Group Ltd. is the main company overseeing the Group.\n\nHawker Siddeley Aviation Ltd. has been created from the assets of Gloster Aircraft Ltd. and Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Ltd. and will focus on aircraft manufacture and component work, repair work and development of guided weapons and other aviation-related items.\n\nA.V. Roe Aviation Ltd. is responsible for all civilian and heavy military aircraft design and their construction at Chadderton and Woodford.\n\nHawker Aviation Ltd. is responsible for military aircraft design (fighters, trainers etc.) and their construction at Kingston-on Thames and Dunsfold.\n\nSaunders-Roe Ltd. (Saro) at East Cowes has become the naval aircraft design specialist as well as some advanced project work. Saro is also responsible for the helicopter design team at Weston-Super-Mare.\n\nAvro Canada is now a direct subsidiary company rather than managed by A.V.Roe. Armstrong Siddeley Motors Ltd. and Air Service Training Ltd. remain unchanged.\n\nBritish Combined Aircraft Corporation (BCAC)\n\nOriginally formed in March 1943 as the Bristol Vickers Aircraft Company with the merger of Vickers-Supermarine and Bristol (including Bristol engines). In 1944 Westland joined and the current name was adopted. Vickers-Armstrongs is the majority shareholder, while other major shareholders are John Brown & Co. Ltd. and Associated Electrical Industry Ltd. In March 1948 Percival Aircraft Ltd. was acquired from the Hunting Group Limited (the holding company of Hunting & Son Ltd.) in return for a 10% share in BCAC. There has been consolidation of design teams and production facilities, Weybridge is the main design centre, Filton handling rotary-wing work and Yeovil maintains a design team under W.E.W. Petter. All Bristol designed commercial aircraft are marketed under the ‘BC’ label and Vickers commercial aircraft ‘VC’. Percival types will retain their original designations for the time being but commercial types will be marketed under the ‘PC’ label. The titles BCAC (Vickers-Supermarine), BCAC (Bristol) and BCAC (Westland) are still in use for some marketing products.\n\nAIRCO\n\nAIRCO, the third conglomerate in the industry formed on March 6 1938 when Handley Page Ltd. merged with de Havilland and in August 1941 Fairey Aviation Co. Ltd. joined. Each company trades individually but there is close co-operation between design and sales teams and joint use of research resources. AIRCO controls; Handley Page Aircraft Ltd, de Havilland Company Ltd., de Havilland Australia Pty Ltd., de Havilland Canada Ltd., de Havilland Forge Ltd., de Havilland Engine Co. Ltd., AIRCO-Reed Propellers Ltd. (merger of de Havilland Propellers Ltd. and Fairey-Reed Ltd.), Hearle-Whitley Engineering Co. Ltd., Airspeed Aviation Ltd. (now de Havilland’s Christchurch Division), Fairey Aviation Co. Ltd, and Avions Fairey in Belgium.\n\nNational Electronic Engineering Limited (NEE)\n\nFormed in 1940 by the merger of English Electric, Napier & Son, Napier-Paxman and Paxman. In 1944 it acquired Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd. and in 1945 acquired the Marconi Company to become the biggest electrical engineering, industrial engineering and electronics manufacturer in Britain.\n\n[Note in this scenario English Electric did not build aircraft but this company covers Alvis and Napier aero-engines.]\n\nBlackburn & Boulton Paul Group\n\nIn March 1949 Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd. merged with the Blackburn Group (which includes Blackburn Engines Ltd.) to form a wide-ranging group covering several aspects of aviation engineering. The Dumbarton works is run jointly with William Denny & Bros. Ltd.\n\nBoulton Paul owns a majority 51% stake in Martin-Baker Company Ltd.\n\nGeneral Aviation (UK) Ltd.\n\nFormed in early 1944 by the pooling of the aviation interests of Parnall Aircraft Ltd., which owned the patents, patent rights and designs of Nash & Thompson Ltd. and the Hendy Aircraft Co., with those of Portsmouth Aviation. In March 1947 the Navarro Aircraft Construction Company also merged with the company to secure capital and construction facilities for the Tribian Sponson.\n\nMaintenance and repair services at Portsmouth, includes contract with Portsmouth, Southsea & Isle of Wight Aviation.\n\nDesign and manufacture of powered-gun turrets for aircraft by Nash & Thompson Ltd. at Yate.\n\nIndependent Companies\n\nAero Engines Ltd.\n\nBuilders of 23hp Sprite and 50hp Pixie.\n\nF.M. Aspin & Company Ltd. Ltd.\n\nDevelopment and manufacture of auxiliary power-units for large aircraft.\n\nManufacture of engines and gearboxes for the automotive industry.\n\nAuster Aircraft Ltd.\n\nChilton Aircraft Ltd.\n\nIncluding Owns Carden Aero Engines Co., building engines for ultralight aircraft based on the Ford Ten car engine and Chilton Electronics Ltd., founded in 1946, parent company of the Chilton group, manufactures the Chilton shaver socket and circuit breakers.\n\nDart Aircraft Ltd.\n\n(premises shared with Hawkridge Aircraft Company).\n\nHawkridge Aircraft Company\n\n(premises shared with Dart Aircraft Ltd.).\n\nManufacture, maintenance and repair of gliders.\n\nHeston Aircraft Company Ltd.\n\nOther Work:\n\nSub-contract work for de Havilland for structural elements and components for NEE aero engines.\n\nJameson Aero Engines Ltd.\n\nJameson 1, 100hp, 4-cyl four-stroke piston engine, certificated 1945.\n\nMartin-Baker Company Ltd.\n\nBoulton Paul owns a majority 51% stake in the company. Undertakes research, development and manufacture of ejection-seats for aircraft and other life-saving devices for pilots.\n\nMiles Aircraft Ltd.\n\nOther Work:\n\nOperation of the Aeronautical Technical School in Reading.\n\nOther business interests include Philidas Ltd. producing locking nuts, Copycat Ltd. manufacturing photocopiers and the Miles Martin Pen Co. Ltd.\n\nReid and Sigrist Ltd.\n\nOther Work:\n\nManufacture of precision aircraft instrumentation, notably turn and slip indicators invented by George Reid, the Gyorizon (combined turn indicator and artificial) and 3-axis gyroscopes at New Malden.\n\nOperation of a civilian flying training school at Desford.\n\nRepair contracts with the RAF, work undertaken at Desford.\n\nRolls-Royce Ltd.\n\nWorks: Derby, Derbyshire; Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Barnoldswick, Lancashire. (The factory at Crewe, Cheshire is now totally dedicated to motor car production.)\n\nRolls-Royce has a 50% stake in Rotol Airscrews Ltd. along with the Bristol Aero-Engine Company Ltd.\n\nScottish Aviation Ltd.\n\nOther Work:\n\nFlying school and maintenance contract work at Prestwick.\n\nOperates Scottish Airlines (Prestwick) Ltd., the airline undertakes worldwide passenger and cargo charter flights to destinations all over Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, Canada and the United States from its base at Prestwick.\n\nShort Brothers (Rochester & Bedford) Ltd. and Short & Harland Ltd.\n\nShort & Harland Ltd. at Belfast undertakes a wide range of other aviation and non-aviation related engineering work.\n\nSubsidiary Pobjoy-Short at Hooton Park, Cheshire, designs and manufacturers auxiliary accessory gearboxes and auxiliary power units in co-operation with Rotol Airscrews Ltd.\n\nSlingsby Sailplanes Ltd.\n\nTipsy Aircraft Company Ltd.\n\nTipsy Junior, single-seat light aircraft, Belgian prototype OO-TIT first flown 30 June 1946, licence-production began September 1947.\n\nWhat to do with the independent airframe firms\n\nIn 1948 ITTL they were.\n\nAuster Aircraft (IOTL the Firm & F.G. Miles (founded 1951) became part of Beagle in 1962 which in 1969 called in the Receiver & closed in 1970).\n\nBoulton Paul Aircraft (IOTL ceased own aircraft design in late 1950 & became part of Dowty Group in 1961)\n\nHandley Page (IOTL went into liquidation 1970)\n\nMiles Aircraft (IOTL went into liquidation 1947 and assets acquired by Handley Page - became H.P.

Both firms built Canberras, a medium bomber and transport aircraft in the 1950s & 1960s. Maybe there's some synergy to be had.\n\nYou beat me to it with the quotes from Woods' Project Cancelled - I have images of the pages (I also have the engine manufacturers table and the additional tables regarding when certain aircraft projects completed compared to the U.S.A. etc.\n\nI agree - I think Handley Page should go into BAC - they did do collaborative work with the group/companies within the group so to me it seems a good fit.\n\nOriginally I had thought of H.P. merging with the other 'spare' companies to form a third group, but, even allowing for some amazing financial miracle post-war, I think in reality this would be, if not a non-starter, they would have had to merge with one of the 'Big Two'.\n\nSomewhere, I have an article about De Havilland and their 'near' merging with BAC - now THAT would have been an interesting twist to the dynamic!\n\nLastly (for now) and I apologise for rambling....I think there should be TWO engine suppliers. I HATE the idea of everything being under the Rolls-Royce banner. If nothing else, by keeping Bristol-Siddeley engines as a separate entity and merging with other firms, we should get a better selection of engines and not dependent upon a single supplier.\n\nLastly (for now) and I apologise for rambling....I think there should be TWO engine suppliers.

If nothing else, by keeping Bristol-Siddeley engines as a separate entity and merging with other firms, we should get a better selection of engines and not dependent upon a single supplier.\n\nFor what it's worth so do I and for all 3 sentences.\n\nAs I understand it Armstrong-Siddeley, Bristol and De Havilland designed competing engines in every power class (if that's the right expression) in the period 1948-60. If that's correct the earlier created Bristol Siddeley Engines can put three times the effort into one engine in each power class 1948-60.\n\nI want one of the results to be a turboshaft engine for helicopters in the same class as the GE T58 to become available in time to be fitted to all helicopters that used the Alvis Leonidas IOTL. (Note that's what I want to happen ITTL, not what may happen ITTL.) As I understand it Bristol wanted the Type 173 to have a pair of Janus turboshafts. However, development was halted because the Firm didn't have the staff to do Janus, Olympus & Proteus and Janus drew the short straw. In the late 1950s Bristol Helicopters wanted to fit AS P.181 turboshafts to Types 203 & 214. However, the engines were cancelled by BSE in favour of the DH Gnome based on the GE T58 and the helicopters were cancelled when Bristol Helicopters became part of Westland because the latter had the Whirlwind Series 3 and Wessex HC.2 which used the Gnome.\n\nFor what it's worth so do I and for all 3 sentences.\n\nAs I understand it Armstrong-Siddeley, Bristol and De Havilland designed competing engines in every power class (if that's the right expression) in the period 1948-60.

Then it began work on the ASX in 1943 followed by the Mamba, Python and Adder and acquired the Vickers Metropolitan F.9 Sapphire when Metrovick decided to cut its losses and get out of the game in 1948 (thankfully saving us from another company in this scenario to worry about!).\n\nde Havilland was reliant on Frank Halford's genius and had the Ghost and Goblin along with plans for a 500shp H.3 turboprop which never got off the drawing board. Halford's H.7 gas generator became the Napier Oryx. Proposed for fitting to Bristol's Type 173, it instead languished in the laughable Percival P.74 and then vanished without trace - the MoS funded at least 5 variants of 850-900shp - but the more powerful 1,100-920shp Gazelle appeared off the back of that.\n\nBristol had a whole raft of designs.\n\nEven in 1948 there is fat to be trimmed. Even if we accept the Air Staff's highly optimistic forecasts in 1945 that piston power will be gone within a decade, there were too many irons in the fire - Britain had arguably got through WW2 with just 6 major engines, yet in the jet age in 1948 we have: Derwent, Nene, Tay, Tweed, Clyde, Dart, Avon, Ghost, Goblin, Sapphire, Phoebus, Olympus, Theseus, Proteus, ASX, Adder, Mamba, Python.\n\nSome of these died natural deaths, others flopped and others became world beaters. In 1948 its probably too early to tell who are the winners but there were multiples in every class.\n\nJanus was originally a 1,000shp turbine but the MoS trimmed it to 500shp to avoid competition with other projects - presumably Dart and Python. There wasn't much in this class, Halford's H.3 having not materialised. But I reckon if de Havilland engines are left alone to do the job with Halford, uniting work on H.3 and H.7 would get you a decent T58-class turboshaft by 1956.\n\nTo be honest I'd not given how it happened any thought. As my mergers are the real mergers brought forward 10-15 years the best I can say is that they were done in the same fashion as the real mergers, but as already written, sooner.\n\nThis could be tricky given the lack of cash in 1945-48, lack of orders and the over-abundance of shopfloor capacity.\n\nIt might - indeed as in my 1950 scenario - require MoS financial lubrication or pressure.\n\nIf I remember my Correlli Barnett correctly, electronics was yet another sector of British industry that he claimed was organised into a large number of small firms that couldn't compete with Germany, Japan and the USA. Was he correct? If he was correct would a complimentary reorganisation of the British electronics industry be justified? If it was justified, what benefits can HM Forces expect? Do we get better radars, sonars and guided missiles of all types?\n\nBritain arguably was never 'weak' in this area from the 1930s onwards, perhaps with less R&D resources, but not massively inferior. Competing with the USA is a non-starter really given the larger industrial base there. But yes, there was a case for some rationalisation and enlarging of facilities, especially in the military sphere. The 1950s saw newcomers like ECKO making a bigger name for themselves.\n\nMy National Electronic Engineering Ltd is a bit of a monster, easily matching GEC in this period. There is a strong overlap in locomotive production, diesels (Napier and Paxman combined - in my AH both cooperated on diesel aero engines in the 1930s) to combine the Deltic with Paxman's series of diesels, nearly all British marine diesels would be from NEE. There is a huge chunk of electronics and industrial electronics in there, Marconi adds radios and military kit too, radars etc. Alvis brings not only automotive engines and chassis (cars, lorries, armoured vehicles) but allows Alvis and Napier to combine their Leonides, Sabre, Nomad lines into one development team. In theory you could build a gas turbine team here, but honestly I'd rather not. Arguably this company is something like BAE Systems is today - except with cars and trains instead of fighters and shipbuilding.\n\nI suspect in my alt-world Elliotts and Ferranti would tie-up sooner to counteract Marconi in this huge NEE. I might even be tempted to chuck in ECKO - ELFK?\n\nMissiles is tricky, I need to give this much more thought given how spread around this work was.\n\nI agree - I think Handley Page should go into BAC - they did do collaborative work with the group/companies within the group so to me it seems a good fit.\n\nOriginally I had thought of H.P. merging with the other 'spare' companies to form a third group, but, even allowing for some amazing financial miracle post-war, I think in reality this would be, if not a non-starter, they would have had to merge with one of the 'Big Two'.\n\nI have always had a soft spot for Handley Page. Arguably, apart from picking up bankrupt Miles in 1947, HP did not move fast enough in the corporate world to build a group. Blackburn for example was relatively close by. But for me, in this period a HP-DH tie up seems the most logical. DH had more experience of smaller aircraft, HP with larger aircraft. They could combine a civil line up from trainers and feederliners to jetliners and cargo lifters quite easily and would be therefore perhaps less reliant on military orders. Imagine HP's potential input into the Comet or Victor tech feeding into later Comet variants.\n\nI think there should be TWO engine suppliers. I HATE the idea of everything being under the Rolls-Royce banner. If nothing else, by keeping Bristol-Siddeley engines as a separate entity and merging with other firms, we should get a better selection of engines and not dependent upon a single supplier.\n\nAgreed.\n\nIn my view two threes are preferable. If rationalisation had been carried out early enough, I think that there would have been ample work for 3 airframe groups and 3 engine groups and a couple of large independent airframe companies, more than enough to give the RAF/RN/BOAC/BEA design choices and yet not too many to suck out R&D funds.\n\nThis could be tricky given the lack of cash in 1945-48, lack of orders and the over-abundance of shopfloor capacity. It might - indeed as in my 1950 scenario - require MoS financial lubrication or pressure.\n\nWood suggested \"carrot and stick\" tactics too. I think he said something like \"merge or no Government contracts\".\n\nBritain arguably was never 'weak' in this area from the 1930s onwards, perhaps with less R&D resources, but not massively inferior. Competing with the USA is a non-starter really given the larger industrial base there. But yes, there was a case for some rationalisation and enlarging of facilities, especially in the military sphere. The 1950s saw newcomers like ECKO making a bigger name for themselves.\n\nAnother story I heard was that a British engineer proposed the silicone chip 4 years before the American engineer who invented it did. However, the British Government and none of the British electronic firms was prepared to take the financial risk. Is that true too? Even if it is true they might take more than 4 years developing it and putting it into production.\n\nMy National Electronic Engineering Ltd is a bit of a monster, easily matching GEC in this period. There is a strong overlap in locomotive production, diesels (Napier and Paxman combined - in my AH both cooperated on diesel aero engines in the 1930s) to combine the Deltic with Paxman's series of diesels, nearly all British marine diesels would be from NEE. There is a huge chunk of electronics and industrial electronics in there, Marconi adds radios and military kit too, radars etc. Alvis brings not only automotive engines and chassis (cars, lorries, armoured vehicles) but allows Alvis and Napier to combine their Leonides, Sabre, Nomad lines into one development team. In theory you could build a gas turbine team here, but honestly I'd rather not. Arguably this company is something like BAE Systems is today - except with cars and trains instead of fighters and shipbuilding.\n\nRe trains, that might help with British Railways' dash for diesel under it's Modernisation Plan. More standardisation through having fewer firms to share the orders among. As I understand it the English Electric designs were amongst the few that worked first time. And possibly fewer teething problems and outright failures due to having to buy more of their locomotives by default.\n\nAnother story I heard was that a British engineer proposed the silicone chip 4 years before the American engineer who invented it did. However, the British Government and none of the British electronic firms was prepared to take the financial risk. Is that true too? Even if it is true they might take more than 4 years developing it and putting it into production.\n\nI'd have to look up the silicone chip claim.\n\nAs to putting money where their mouth is - hell even Lyon's Corner Houses built their own computer!\n\nIronically for this thread, LEO later merged with English Electric! Becoming English Electric Leo Marconi in 1964.\n\nCould there have been a turboshaft member of the family? I've suggested Anaconda previously. The Mamba competed against the RR Dart. Would a turboshaft version of that engine have been feasible? Would it have been advisable?\n\nYes I think it could be, wouldn't be that difficult - turboprops and turboshafts are essentially the same thing just with the shafting and gearing being different. Actually the specs based off the standard ASMa.6 Mamba look almost identical to those of the NGa.2(R) Gazelle. Might be ready a year or so sooner.\n\nNow we mention this - just realised from my mega list of early jet project that I missed off the Napier Naiad and Eland! The Eland was built in a helicopter turboshaft application, giving 2,920shp for the Westland Westminster. A bit too much grunt for smaller choppers but another engine that had few chances to shine despite the gold lavished on it.\n\nLastly (for now) and I apologise for rambling....I think there should be TWO engine suppliers. I HATE the idea of everything being under the Rolls-Royce banner. If nothing else, by keeping Bristol-Siddeley engines as a separate entity and merging with other firms, we should get a better selection of engines and not dependent upon a single supplier.\n\nNeed to keep at least 2 engine companies for the same reason. Just don't have a clue who the second one should be, Rolls is the given.\n\nPhil Oakey was being boiled and I'm being blond. Again. I created two engine companies in the late 1940s in Post 3. I don't know if you're agreeing with me or didn't notice and are suggesting it.\n\nTo keep it simple the two firms are Rolls-Royce plus Napier and the the Real-Bristol Siddeley Engines created a decade-and-a-bit sooner. All other things being equal BSE remains independent until 1966 which was when RR bought it IOTL.\n\nIn Post 3 Alvis and Power Jets as independent companies. At present the latter is still nationalised in 1946 to become the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE). Aero engine development at Alvis ceased in the late 1950s IOTL and ITTL it ends by the early 1950s as it looses most of its Leonides sales to the turboshaft engines in the 500-1,000shp class that RR & BSE develop ITTL. The Firm was purchased by Rover in 1965 IOTL and ITTL it might be purchased by Rover in the early 1950s to match the earlier formation of BSE and Greater Rolls-Royce. An alternative is that it joins BSE in the late 1940s with the aero engine side becoming part of the BSE Small Engines Division and the motor vehicle side becoming part of BSE's Motor Vehicle Division which also had the cars business of Armstrong-Siddeley Motors and Bristol Cars.\n\nI would want to keep two separate companies building helicopters. Competition is good.\n\nOnce again I'm a blond because there are two separate companies building helicopters in my timeline because Bristol Helicopters Division becomes part of BAC in the 1945-48 period instead of joining Greater Westland which is what happened circa 1960 IOTL. I wrote as much in Post 2.\n\nGreater Westland is the OTL Westland of 1960-ish less Bristol Helicopters, so it sill includes Cierva-Weir, Fairey and Saunders Roe as well as Westland itself. However, having thought about it more Greater Westland may be too large and BAC Helicopters' Division (formerly Bristol Helicopters) may be too small. I definitely want Fairey & Saunders Roe to be part of Greater Westland so that leaves Cierva-Weir to become part of BAC Helicopters' Division.\n\nI'd also want some dedicated rocket/guided missile engineering teams, in addition to the aircraft engineering teams. These may end up in 3 further sub-specialties: big ballistics, aircraft weapons, and SAMs.\n\nI can't remember if I've written it yet in this thread, but Greater Westland is told to stop designing fixed wing aircraft and concentrate on ballistic missiles and helicopters. Therefore, no Fairey Deltas (1 & 2), the SR/A.1 is abandoned in the late 1940s instead of the early 1950s, no Princess, no SR.53, no SR.177 and possibly no Fairey Gannet and if there is one it's ALT-Gannet which is a conventional twin-turboprop aircraft like the Grumman Tracker and its derivatives. The ballistic missile is an earlier Black Knight which like the real one was intended to be a test vehicle from which the technology required for an operational ballistic missile could be developed.\n\nFairey becoming part of Westland sooner means its work on tip jets is ended in the late 1940s, so no Gyrodyne, Rotodyne and Ultra Light Helicopter. Instead efforts are concentrated on building something better than the Skeeter (preferably something like the Scout/Wasp) and the Westland Westminster. IOTL one Rotodyne was built out of 2 planned and 2 Westminster prototypes were built. Therefore, at least 4 Westminster prototypes were built ITTL.\n\nThere won't be any specialised rocket/missile teams. However, BAC, HS, Greater Short & Harland and Greater Westland will have Dynamics Divisions which comprised the rocket/missile teams that its constituent companies had in the 1950s IOTL.\n\nLink to Post 2, which was the airframe groups created 1945-48 ITTL Mark One.​\n\nBritish Aircraft Corporation created 1945-1948 ITTL\n\nBristol Aeroplane Company.\n\nEnglish Electric.\n\nHandley Page (IOTL went into liquidation 1970).\n\nMiles Aircraft (IOTL went into liquidation 1947 and assets acquired by Handley Page - became H.P.

B.35/46 ITTL. H.P. built the Victor IOTL and the Victor is still built ITTL. Meanwhile, the Avro Vulcan is still built ITTL and that firm's part of Greater Hawker Siddeley ITTL. Therefore, H.P. joins BAC ITTL by default.\n\nMiles Aircraft joins BAC because Wood wanted it to become a division of one of the new industry groups. It could just as easily have become part of Greater Hawker Siddeley and the only reason why it doesn't is because Miles was purchased by H.P. IOTL and H.P. became part of BAC ITTL.\n\nCierva-Weir joins BAC to create a stronger Helicopters' Division instead of Greater Westland.\n\nGreater Hawker Siddleley created 1945-48 ITTL\n\nThe Original Hawker Siddeley.\n\nA.V.
