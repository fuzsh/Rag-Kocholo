Later that year, in October, the First Annual General Meeting of IATA was held in Montreal. At that time, there were 57 members from 31 countries. Today, IATA represents some 330 members from all over the world.\n\nThe 55th Annual General Meeting, in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, marked the first formal use of World Air Transport Summit, in recognition of the status of the IATA AGM as the premier, industry-wide platform for the debate of critical issues at the highest level. More on the history of IATA.\n\nNext AGM:\n\nDelhi, June 2025, hosted by IndiGo\n\nPast AGMs\n\nDubai, 2-4 June 2024"
