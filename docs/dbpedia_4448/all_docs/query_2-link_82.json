        "text": "A PAIR of President John F. Kennedy's long johns with blood stains has mysteriously appeared on eBay for a whopping $1 million.\n\nThe long johns appeared to have a blood stain near the ankle with possible traces of DNA to the 35th president of the United States.\n\nKennedy served as president from 1961 until he was assassinated in a brutal public display on November 22, 1963.\n\nEven though he died nearly 62 years ago, his clothing is still resurfacing and is up for auction.\n\nThe long johns had a hole in them, suggesting Kennedy frequently wore them.\n\nA small square was cut out of the first fabric, which was used in the construction of a famous limited edition collectible doll, John-John.\n\nIt wasn't until a photographer was hired to take pictures of the clothing that the bloodstains were discovered.\n\nThe long johns are one of two pairs sold to memorabilia dealer and collector Richard Wilson at Guernsey's 1998 Kennedy auction.\n\nThey were then listed in a catalog in 2002 and later purchased in a private sale.\n\nA copy of his original Certificate of Authenticity (COA) is included with the sale.\n\nWilson was even featured holding up a pair of underwear in a 1998 New York Post article about the forthcoming Kennedy auction.\n\nThe intimate clothing item was described as \"a pair of his personal wool long john underwear.\"\n\nA few years later, the Heritage Auctions sold the pair.\n\nOne had the Duofold label, and the second was labeled with John F. Kennedy's ID sewn into the collar.\n\n\"When we bought these over two decades ago, we had made a few pictures of the underwear and then had them stored in a secure vault for nearly twenty years,\" said the seller.\n\n\"No one told us about the stains, nor did we notice them. Not until now.\n\n\"To get a better understanding of what we had discovered, we delved into forensics trying to figure out possible circumstances that would produce this injury,\" they continued.\n\n\"The locus of the injury was on the lower shin area, just above the ankle.\"\n\nThe seller speculated that's where Kennedy began bleeding, believing the blood \"spread out around the upper ankle.\"\n\nThey said the blood was also \"diluted and covered a wider area,\" claiming, \"it can be assumed that the blood had dribbled down the leg from the point of injury.\"\n\nThe seller revealed a second stain much wider than the first believing the previous owners attempted to clean the area using a cleaning agent.\n\nThey suggested, \"the President was probably standing up or in an upright or semi-upright position, while he was bleeding.\"\n\n\"It is felt that the President, perhaps in a passionate mode, was not aware of the primary injury, that he might have been preoccupied, and only later discovered the secondary blood, which he tried to remove.\"\n\nLONG HISTORY\n\nThe former president's long johns have been well-documented over the years, long before they were initially auctioned in 1998.\n\nNewspaper articles on the clothing date back to June 12, 1979, in The National Enquirer.\n\nThe pair being sold was previously bought to be used by The Great American Doll Company and has since \"accumulated a great deal of additional provenance because of what we did with them,\" according to the seller.\n\nBefore they were sold to The Great American Doll Company, Kennedy's wife, Jackie Kennedy, gathered some of her most expensive items to be sold from their 1953 wedding.\n\nShe reportedly wrapped the items in Kennedy's long johns as she transported them to an antique dealer in Washington, D.C.\n\nBeing that the long johns have been through an ordeal of events, the seller is hoping to sell the relic to \"a good home.\""
