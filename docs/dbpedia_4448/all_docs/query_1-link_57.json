        "text": "Loganair is delighted to announce the appointment of Natalie Bush as Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Accountable Manager. Natalie, who is currently the UK Director and Accountable Manager for TUI Airways, will join as part of our Executive Committee in December 2024, and will report to CEO, Luke Farajallah. She will also be joining the Board Safety Review Committee, reporting directly to the Loganair Chairman James Drummond on matters relating to airline safety and safety culture. Natalie has had an impressive career to date, which commenced with several years in the Royal Navy as a Warfare officer, before she joined Flybe as a pilot, initially flying the BAE146, and the Embraer 195. Her flying career progressed to see her achieve a command on the Q400 fleet at the same time as taking on management roles, ultimately leading to being appointed as Director of Safety and Security for the airline until 2019, when she left to join Specialist Aviation Services (now Gama Aviation) as COO. Following a successful time in the rotary sector delivering helicopter and maintenance services to the UK air ambulance industry, she then returned to the airline sector with TUI Airways. Natalie will assume leadership for all operational and service delivery areas including the pilot, cabin crew and airport workforce groups across Loganair. She will also be responsible for ground handling, safety, security, and compliance, as well as for the network operations teams. She will additionally lead industrial relations across the front-line areas. Luke Farajallah, CEO, Loganair, said: “We are extremely happy to have been able to attract one of the most talented rising stars of the aviation sector, whose career is going from strength to strength, to the UK’s largest regional airline. Natalie makes a huge impact wherever she goes, and she thoroughly deserves this important and exciting leadership opportunity at Loganair. We are looking forward to her arrival later this year.”\n\nWe are delighted to announce the appointment of Stuart Duncan as our new Director of Legal, reporting to CFO Chris Gemmell, as part of the Leadership Team. Stuart joined us on August 1st, and will split his working time between our offices in Glasgow and Aberdeen, acting as internal legal counsel, providing comprehensive guidance across various aspects of our operation, and assisting the business to increase and improve its understanding and competence of all things legal. Stuart brings a broad background of experience following his qualification as a solicitor in 1998. He started his career in Glasgow as a commercial property lawyer in private practice, before moving in-house for a ten-year stint as head of legal for a UK-listed property investment company. He and his family then moved back to his roots in Aberdeen, where he joined Bond Offshore Helicopters with responsibility for supporting all aspects of the operation during a period of significant growth and transition. Having a particular focus on commercial contracts, this led to him developing a strong working relationship with Loganair over the last few years. Stuart’s appointment heralds a new phase of exciting changes to the Loganair leadership, with further announcements expected in the coming days and weeks.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that Loganair will be the official Airline Partner of the Orkney2025 Island Games! ✈️🤝 This will be the biggest event Orkney has ever hosted, marking the 40th anniversary of the Games.
