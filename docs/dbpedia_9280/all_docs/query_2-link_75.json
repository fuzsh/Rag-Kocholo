        "text": "Texas’ independent streak is part of its international reputation. The Lone Star State is known far and wide as a self-sufficient place full of self-sufficient people.\n\nWhich is probably why Curious Texas received this question from across the pond: How did Texas become the Lone Star State and when did Texas decide to rejoin the Union?\n\nThe question, submitted by Louise Percival from Wilmslow, Cheshire, in the United Kingdom, is part of an ongoing project from The Dallas Morning News that invites you to join in our reporting process. The idea is simple: You have questions, and our journalists are trained to track down answers.\n\nTo understand our Lone Star history, you have to first know the six flags of Texas, or nations that have controlled Texas over time: France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States and the Confederacy.\n\nAfter proclaiming our independence from Mexico, the Republic of Texas officially adopted the lone star flag we know and love in 1839. The colors, “blood red, azure blue and white” represent bravery, loyalty and purity, according to the Texas State Historical Association. It’s unknown who designed the flag, but it was introduced to the Republic’s legislature by Sen. William Harris Wharton.\n\nIt also introduced the world to the Lone Star of Texas. The star is said to represent our independence as a single republic — as opposed to the star-spangled flag of the United States.\n\nAs for Louise’s other question — when Texas decided to rejoin the Union — things are a little more complicated.\n\nAfter nearly a decade as an independent republic, government officials in Austin and Washington, D.C., began talking about annexation. In February 1845, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that allowed for Texas to become part of the union if it voted to do so.\n\nMexico, which never officially recognized the independence of Texas, had threatened the U.S. with war if it annexed the state. Texans, however, voted in October 1845 to join the U.S., sparking the Mexican-American War.\n\nYet Texas was not long for the union, and voted in 1861 to secede and join the Confederate States of America. One of the main reasons, according to the state’s Declaration of Causes: “maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery ... which her people intended should exist in all future time.”\n\nWhen the rebellion ended on April 9, 1865, Texas joined the Union once again.\n\nTell us!\n\nWhat do you wonder about the culture, people and institutions of North Texas — and the rest of our great state? Help us investigate stories that matter to you.\n\nNo question is too big or too small. Let's get started!"
