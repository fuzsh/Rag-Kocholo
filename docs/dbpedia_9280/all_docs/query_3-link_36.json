        "text": "Welcome to the Len Kubiak History Page\n\nHISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS (1836-1846)\n\nThe first Texas provisional government for the Texians was formed at San Felipe de Austin on November 7, 1835. This council passed a declaration of support for the 1824 Mexican constitution, and appointed a governor and other officials. However, this council stopped short of declaring Texas independence.\n\nThe first declaration of independence for modern Texas was signed in Goliad on December 20, 1835. The Texas Declaration of Independence was enacted at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836, effectively creating the Republic of Texas.\n\nFour days later, the thirteen day Siege of the Alamo ended as Mexican General Antonio Lï¿½pez de Santa Anna's forces defeated the 183 Texians defending the small mission (which would eventually become the center of the city of San Antonio). Remember the Alamo! became the battle cry of the Texas Revolution.\n\nThe Battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21, 1836, near the present-day city of Houston. General Santa Anna's entire force of 1,600 men was killed or captured by Texas General Sam Houston's army of 800 Texians; only nine Texians died. This decisive battle resulted in Texas' independence from Mexico.\n\nThe Republic of Texas was located between the United States and Mexico and existed for a short period of time (1836 to 1845). The Republic of Texas was formed as a break-away republic from Mexico and claimed a huge territory that included all of the present state of Texas, as well as parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. The eastern boundary of the Texas Republic was defined by the Adams-Onis Treaty between the United States and Spain in 1819. Its southern boundary was the Rio Grande.\n\nSam Houston was the first elected Prisident of the Republic of Texas and served for two separate terms, 1836ï¿½1838 and 1841ï¿½1844. He also was Governor of the state of Texas from 1859 to 1861.\n\nThe first Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, known as the \"Father of Texas\", died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as Secretary of State for the new Republic.\n\nCAPITALS OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS\n\nIn 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas before Sam Houston moved the capital to Austin in 1837. The temporary capitals included Velasco (nw Freeport), Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, and Columbia (Now West Columbia).before Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. In 1839, the capital was moved to the new town of Austin.\n\nThe early years of the Republic of Texas were tension-filled because of the conflict of the nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with Native Americans.\n\nThe first flag of the republic was the \"Burnet Flag\" (which was inspired by the Bonnie Blue Flag), followed shortly thereafter by official adoption of the Lone Star Flag. The Republic received diplomatic recognition from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Yucatï¿½n.\n\nTEXAS STATEHOOD\n\nOn February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that authorized the United States to annex the Republic of Texas and on March 1, 1845 U.S. President John Tyler signed the bill. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. On October 13 of the same year, a majority of voters in the Republic approved a proposed constitution that was later accepted by the US Congress, making Texas a U.S. state on the same day annexation took effect (therefore bypassing a territorial phase). One of the primary motivations for annexation was that the Texas government had incurred huge debts which the United States agreed to assume upon annexation. In 1852, in return for this assumption of debt, a large portion of Texas-claimed territory, now parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming, was ceded to the Federal government.\n\nANNEXATION RESOLUTION\n\nThe annexation resolution has been the topic of some incorrect historical beliefsï¿½chiefly, that the resolution was a treaty between sovereign states, and granted Texas the explicit right to secede from the Union. This was a right argued by some to be implicitly held by all states at the time, up until the conclusion of the Civil War. However, no such right was explicitly enumerated in the resolution. The resolution did include two unique provisions: first, it gave the new state of Texas the right to divide itself into as many as five states with approval of its legislature. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. This means that generally, the only lands owned by the federal government within Texas have actually been purchased by the government.\n\nPresidents of the Republic of Texas\n\nDavid G.
