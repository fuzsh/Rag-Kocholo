        "text": "It was also said the star was a representation of how Texas was the only state to demand its rights from Mexico. The lone star would become the defining symbol of the state. The nickname “The Lone Star State” was more of a traditional moniker, until Governor Abbott declared it the official state nickname in 2015.\n\nWhat Is Texas Known For: 30 Things Texas Is Famous For\n\nDiscover the 30 things that Texas is famous for, from iconic landmarks to cultural phenomena, showcasing the vast and varied landscape of the state.\n\nNickname \"Lone Star State\"\n\nThere are a lot of different interpretations of what happened, but the narrative usually starts south of the border.\n\nIn the distant past, Texas was one of the provinces that made up Mexico. Coahuila and Tejas was the name given to the region that would eventually become the state of Texas.\n\nThis region was comprised of two distinct parts. It is said that the first flag to represent this region included two golden stars in the center of the Mexican flag's traditional colors of red, green, and white.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, Texas state’s struggle was focused on winning its independence from Mexico. Due to their success, the newly independent Republic of Texas received a new flag with a lone star with the word \"Texas\" written prominently across it for the first time. This Texas flag and all future variants included a solitary star in the center, representing resistance, pride, and, most importantly, independence.\n\nOn December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state to join the Union as a free and independent nation. Even though they are no longer citizens of a republic that stands independently, Texans continue to take pride in their rugged individuality and independent spirit.\n\nOn January 4, 1889, a Senate committee paid $10 to Austin artist Peter Krag to create a color drawing of a new red, white, and blue flag for Texas — its lone star, of course. Krag's drawing became the prototype of the same flag that still represents the lone star state today.\n\nOn January 4, 1889, a Senate committee paid $10 to Austin artist Peter Krag to create a color drawing of a new red, white, and blue flag for the lone star state.\n\nPeople that are content to make Texas their home continue to embody the \"Lone Star State\" mentality, as could be expected. Texas was one of the first states in the United States to enact energy deregulation, which paved the way for the majority of Texans to have the ability to choose their power supplier.\n\nEverything is Big in Texas\n\nEveryone knows that Texans like to talk about how great their state is. But the saying \"Large hats, big hair, or big attitudes aren't the only things that are bigger in Texas\" doesn't just mean those things. It comes from the fact that the state is made up of a very large area.\n\nWith a total of 268,820 square miles. The lone star state is second only to Alaska in total land area. But there are more than sixty times as many people in the state of Texas as in Alaska. The Texas Census Bureau thinks that by 2020, about 29 million people will be living in the state.\n\nThe only state with more people than Texas is California, and three cities in Texas are among the ten most populous in the United States. Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are the names of these cities. The lone star state's economy is about the same size as India's, which makes it one of the biggest in the world.\n\nAs common with most states, the land of Texas also has a unique nickname. \"The Lone Star State\" is what people call it. If you've thought about the American flag, you know that each star stands for a different state.\n\nBy this reasoning, it's easy to see that for Texas to be called the \"The Lone Star State,\" it must have gone through some hard times in the past. We need to jump into a long history lesson to learn more about how Texas got its name.\n\nFacts About Texas That Will Blow You Away\n\nPrepare to be amazed by a collection of fascinating facts about Texas that showcase the diversity, uniqueness, and sheer awesomeness of the state.\n\nThe European Settlement\n\nEuropeans have lived in Texas for hundreds of years. When the Spanish moved into the area, many native clans lived there. The Spanish settlers used the Caddo word \"Taysha\" to talk about the people who lived there. Taysha means \"friend\" or \"ally\" in the Caddo language. It’s ironic how the settlers considered natives their friends and kept hoarding land!\n\nSpain and France both tried to take control of the huge land area that is now the state of Texas or the lone star state. In the 1800s, the US bought Louisiana, but it wasn't clear what would happen to Texas. British and Spanish settlers lived near the US, and neither group was very friendly. Everyone could see that the US kept growing because of greed. It wanted a large area of land that no one, especially Europeans, could share with it.\n\nMexico's Independence\n\nNapoleon took over Spain in the year 1808. This caused the Spanish settlers to lose their ground in colonizing Texas. In the end, Mexico started a revolution, and in 1810, it became independent. Mexican-Americans wanted Texas to be an independent state with a green flag, but Spain would not give up Texas no matter what. But in 1819, Spain gave Florida to the United States and agreed to set up borders between the two countries.\n\nEverything seemed to be fine until Spain lost control of its land, which led to the creation of many Latin American republics. In 1824, Mexico got a new constitution, and the lone star state was one of the states that made up what is now called Mexican Texas.\n\nFilibusters\n\nA filibuster is an action that makes it hard for a legislative body to move forward. In the Texas revolution, the filibusters were the armed Americans who would take land by force even though there was peace. Why are these people important? In a minute, we'll know.\n\nMexico hardly had any people living there. It was at risk of invasion by European forces who sought to settle in those empty lands. Guadalupe Victoria, president of Mexico at the time, set up a system of empresarios to solve this problem.\n\nAn empresario was a person who was put in charge of helping people from the US move to Mexican Texas. Empresarios were paid from the mainland. Stephen Austin was able to get 300 people from the US to visit him.\n\nNow, people call him the \"father of Texas.\" Under this plan, the American filibusters could buy cheap land in Texas and move there. There were, of course, some rules that people had to follow to live in Mexican Texas.\n\nThey would have to live there for at least ten years.\n\nCatholicism would be their religion.\n\nThey would have to learn Spanish and back the government of New Mexico.\n\nThis system turned out to be very helpful. Within a few years, Mexican Texans had grown by ten times. At one time, there were more Texans or Texians than people born in Mexico. Most immigrants didn't fit in or were criminals.\n\nThe Business Leaders\n\nThe empresarios did a good job of getting people to move to the land from the US. Mexico was starting to make money off Texas, its new border. Hayden Edwards, an empresario, decided that his settlement should be independent. This broke the short-lived peace. The other empresarios quickly ended the trouble, but they lost the respect of the people in charge in Mexico.\n\nIn 1789, the Mexican government issued a ban on slavery. This surprised the Texans, just as it did to many enslaved people. People in Texas held protests and even threatened to rise against the government. So, the government had to be a little more lenient. Still, the Mexican government saw Texas as a place with many problems. The US tried to buy Texas from Mexico twice, but both times President Guadalupe Victoria said no.\n\nPresident Victoria's term ended the same year, which led to many coups and battles between rebels. Some people wanted a central government, while others wanted a state like the US. Texas was in a terrible state.\n\nThe Rule of Dictators\n\nIn 1830, the laws were changed so that no more people from the United States could move to Texas. People were upset but gave up because they knew what was coming next was worse. Antonio Lopéz de Santa Anna, a politician, and former soldier, was chosen as the president because he favored a federal government. After a year, Santa Anna showed how much of a dictator he was by removing all military leaders.\n\nSanta Anna was a very cruel man. He was not kind to anyone who tried to stop him. He told his men to take everything they could from the cities they attacked. In 1835, he told the Gonzales militia to take back a military cannon given to them.\n\nWhen the army got to Gonzales, everyone saw banners with one star, a silhouette of a cannon, and the words \"come and take it\" written on them. This is where you'll get the idea behind \"Lone Star.\"\n\nThe Alamo battle\n\nThe people of Texas chose Sam Houston to lead their army. Even though they were full of hope, they had no chance against Santa Anna's power. At the Alamo, Houston tried to build a fort, which led to a massacre. Mexicans killed the old generals, and Santa Anna thought the Texians were finally defeated.\n\nThe army leader, took advantage of Santa Anna's harshness and spread the slogans \"Remember the Alamo\" and \"Remember Goliad.\" He got as many men as possible and set up a trap for the Mexican army. This time, they didn't show any kindness.\n\nOnly 11 Texans died, while 625 Mexicans did. Santa Anna was caught, and even though he should have been killed, he was forced to sign Texas' freedom. He was held for three weeks until the Mexican army gave up on the Rio Grande and let him go.\n\nThere was a change in the border, and Texas became a republic. At that time, it had a flag with just one star, which is how it got its name.\n\nFor almost ten years, the Republic of Texas was its own country. It wanted to join the US, but that was easier to say than to do. Mexico did not accept it, and the US did not know what to do. Sam Houston was the president of the Republic of Texas, but he stepped down when the United States took over in 1845. Texas, known as the \"Lone Star State,\" was the 28th state to join the Union.\n\nWhat Does The Nickname Mean?\n\nIn theory, everything! Nicknames are often based on how good something is, but that wasn't the case with Texas. The name Texas came into existence because of all the bloodshed, civil wars, rebellions, and other bad things.\n\nSince it went through so much, it deserves to be called the Lone Star because it stood up to everything. People still talk about the Alamo, and the cannon is still there. What happened will never be forgotten, but Texans have always made their Lone Star proud.\n\nLike most other states, Texas is known by its strange name. People often call the state \"The Lone Star State.\" If you've ever thought about the American flag, you probably know that each star represents a different state.\n\nFrom this line of thought, it's easy to see that Texas had to solve some hard historical problems before it could call itself the \"Lone Star State.\" Before we can learn more about how Texas got its name, we need to talk for a long time about its past.\n\nGearing Up for St. Patrick's Day with Irish Texan Cuisine\n\nGet into the St. Patrick's Day spirit with a Texan twist, exploring the fusion of Irish and Texan cuisine that adds a delightful spin to the festivities.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Say You are a \"Lone Star\"?\n\nThe \"lone star\" represents how united Texans fought for independence from Mexico. It was used before the Texas state flag was made. Because of this, the state is called \"The Lone Star State.\"\n\nEven though people have been calling Texas the \"Lone Star State\" for more than 200 years, this name didn't become official until 2015. The lone star is on the Texas flag and the Texas state seal.\n\nTexas is often called the \"Lone Star State\" to honor its fight for independence from New Mexico during the Civil War. In 1836, when Texas became a republic, its flag was changed to have just one star. Also, the well-known white star with five points on top of the bright blue background shows how proud Texans are of their state.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, when Mexico got its freedom from Spain, Texas was still a part of Mexico. In those days, Mexican officials actively encouraged people from the United States to move to the lone star state, which led to more people living there.\n\nAfter he became well-known across the country, General Santa Anna won the election and became the president of the Republic of Mexico. Soon after that, he called himself a dictator, which put him in conflict with a group in Texas that wanted Texas to be independent.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\n1. Six Different Countries Have Ruled Texas\n\nThroughout its history, the lone star state has been a part of six different countries.
