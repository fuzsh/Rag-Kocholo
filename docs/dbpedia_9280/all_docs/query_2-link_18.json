This led to a war between Texas and Mexico, which Texas won. Texas then joined the United States in 1845 as the 28th state.\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction (1861-the 1870s) – Texas later seceded from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the Civil War, Texas was readmitted to the Union in 1870.\n\nPost-Reconstruction (late 19th-early 20th century) – Texas experienced growth in industries such as cattle, oil, and railroads, leading to economic development and urbanization.\n\nTexas modernizes (1945-present) – After the Civil War, Texas underwent reconstruction and experienced rapid growth and development. Today, Texas is known for its diverse economic culture, rich history, and large cities like Houston and Dallas.\n\nOfficial Recognition As Lone Star State\n\nIn 2015, the nickname “The Lone Star State” was officially designated to Texas.
