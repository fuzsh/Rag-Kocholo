We encourage you to re-register as soon as possible within the 60-day re-registration period. If you have a pending TPS application, you do not need to refile for TPS.\n\nIf you are filing an initial application for TPS under Haiti’s redesignation that is effective Aug. 4, 2024, you must register during the registration period that runs from July 1, 2024, through Feb. 3, 2026.

Elliot Rd.\n\nTempe, AZ 85284-1806\n\nUSCIS has automatically extended through Aug. 3, 2025, the validity of EADs issued under the TPS designation for Haiti with an original expiration date of:\n\nAug. 3, 2024;\n\nJune 30, 2024;\n\nFeb. 3, 2023;\n\nDec. 31, 2022;\n\nOct. 4, 2021;\n\nJan. 4, 2021;\n\nJan. 2, 2020;\n\nJuly 22, 2019;\n\nJan. 22, 2018; or\n\nJuly 22, 2017.\n\nIf your EAD is covered by this automatic extension, you may continue to use your existing EAD through Aug. 3, 2025, as evidence that you are authorized to work.\n\nTo obtain an EAD that is valid after Aug. 3, 2025, holders of these EADs must re-register for TPS and file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, following the instructions in the Federal Register notice extending and redesignating Haiti for TPS until Feb. 3, 2026. If we approve your newly filed Form I-765, we will issue you an EAD valid through Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nPlease note this may be the final time USCIS will automatically extend Haiti TPS-based EADs with the notation A-12 or C-19 under Category and a Card Expires date of Dec. 31, 2022; Oct. 4, 2021; Jan. 4, 2021; Jan. 2, 2020; July 22, 2019; Jan. 22, 2018; or July 22, 2017.\n\nTo prove that you are authorized to continue working legally, you may show your employer your TPS-related EAD with an expiration date of:\n\nAug. 3, 2024;\n\nJune 30, 2024;\n\nFeb. 3, 2023;\n\nDec. 31, 2022;\n\nOct. 4, 2021;\n\nJan. 4, 2021;\n\nJan. 2, 2020;\n\nJuly 22, 2019;\n\nJan. 22, 2018; or\n\nJuly 22, 2017.\n\nYou may also show them a copy of the Federal Register notice announcing the automatic extension. Government agencies may also accept these documents if they need to determine your immigration status.\n\nYour employer may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence of the continuing validity of your EAD. Visit the USCIS webpage Documentation Employers May Accept and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries May Present as Evidence of Employment Eligibility for more information.\n\nIf we approve your TPS re-registration application and you apply for an EAD and pay the fee (or we approve your fee-waiver request), we will issue you an EAD with an expiration date of Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nFor more information on TPS eligibility requirements, what to file, and step-by-step instructions, go to the TPS page.\n\n*TPS Beneficiaries Granted under the 2011 Haiti TPS Designation\n\nIf you were granted TPS under the Haiti 2011 designation which is the subject of the Ramos litigation, your TPS and related benefits currently continue through June 30, 2024. For more information, please see the November 2022 FRN. Current beneficiaries covered under the Ramos litigation must re-register according to the latest FRN announcing a redesignation and extension of TPS for Haiti to receive TPS and related benefits through Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page.\n\nTo apply for a lawful permanent status (Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you.\n\nNote on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS status until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv)."
