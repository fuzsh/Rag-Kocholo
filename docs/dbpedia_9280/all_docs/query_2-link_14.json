        "text": "The PoD is that 40 years into a continuing Great Depression, Texas and four allied contiguous states secede from the union.\n\nI'm not sure what this new country could be called. I've seen Taysha (or Tejas) proposed, but that's so obviously a source word for \"Texas\" that the other states wouldn't want to bury their own identity like that.\n\nCaddonia has also been proposed in AH circles, but that seems to me to play up native American roots too much to work for such a modern PoD.\n\nNaming it after a city (\"The Austin Union\") might work, but that somehow feels like a cop-out. Are there any other names that could work?\n\nI still think Republic of Texas is a fairly likely name. It has legitimacy that a new name wouldn't in that Texas was already independent once and encompassed much of the surrounding states who have now joined them in secession. Texas is also going to have probably the majority of the population of this new nation.\n\nI also suspect that no matter what they call themselves the rest of the US is going to call the new nation the Republic of Texas anyway, at least for a while.\n\nIf you let us know what the other four states are it might be easier to come up with a new name.\n\nThe core states for this new country (with otl 2014 populations) in my ah are:\n\nTexas (27m)\n\nOklahoma (3.9m)\n\nNew Mexico (2.1m)\n\nKansas (2.9m)\n\nColorado (5.4m)\n\nIn the ah, negotiations are on the drawing board for Louisiana (4.6m) and Arkansas (3m) to join them. So yes, Texas is about 2/3 of the population, but not quite as extreme as England in the UK.\n\nThe Right-Angled-Borders-Republic?\n\nCOLTEXOKKANM? Sounds kind of Aztec...\n\nI can't think of any real names (i.e. non US of Something) so maybe Republic of X or US of X would work well. The problem I see is that Texas just dominates this union demographically, and everyone's going to be calling it greater Texas or just the Republic of Texas.\n\nLouisiana will be a focal point for Texans because of its control of the Mississippi. Arkansas would likely join a Greater Texas Republic as would Arizona. Colorado and Kansas seem like more of a stretch, but if you find them more amenable in your scenario so be it. A Great Depression at year 40 means Texas is an oil-exporting state in 1969 *or* 1947. Global politics will come into play and a fractured union may be seen to be in the interests of the other World Powers. If there are not too.many other factions then Mississippi and Alabama, if not Tennessee and Missouri, may show interest as well.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=gre...2Ffantasy-political-maps-deviantart;1584;1370\n\nLouisiana will be a focal point for Texans because of its control of the Mississippi.

They have a lot in common politically and the Mississippi is their lifeblood.\n\nHow about:\n\nHigh Plains Confederacy\n\nCentralia\n\nRed River Union (or Federation or Confederation)\n\nAs others have said, including Kansas and (especially Colorado) in this confederation is a stretch, both geographically, historically, and culturally. Also, the mouth of the Mississippi is so critical that I have a very hard seeing the US (or what's left of it) not resisting any attempt by Texas to gain Louisiana."
