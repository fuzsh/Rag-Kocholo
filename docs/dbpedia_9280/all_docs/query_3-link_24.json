        "text": "The Republic of Texas remaining independent and surviving to modern day is slim, it still remains an interesting topic. I have been brainstorming a possible path for Texas to take an remain independent, and I believe it may be plausible.\n\nThe first thing Texas must do upon declaring Independence, is to adopt a very aggressive immigration policy. In 1836 there were millions of Europeans seeking to start over somewhere else. Be it due to famine, war, disease, political and economic turmoil, if Texas ambassadors could recruit these people someway (possibly offering free land) it might not take more than a decade or so to reach 1 million people. They would have to secure about 2000 settlers a month, but it is certainly possible.\n\n2. US civil war\n\nIf the civil war still happens in 1861, Texas could be in a good position to benefit financially. The CSA could use the Texas ports of Houston and Galveston to ship their cotton to GB and France. It would be both European nations best intetest to help gaurd these shipments as well. Texas could see it self rich by 1865\n\n3. French invasion of Mexico\n\nIf Texas can survive until 1862, it would be presented with an interesting delimma, but it would be as such that Texas could benefit from. If Texas aids France, then Napoleon 3 could be persuaded to recognize the Republic as a reward for Texan support. If Texas sides with Benito Juarez, Mexico could offer the same deal. It would ultimately depend on who is president at the time. If Texas sides with Mexico, it could lead with an alliance that similar to NAFTA.\n\n4. Oil\n\nIf Texas could find away to remain until the 1870s, the discovery of oil could be a life saver. Texas would be in a position to get rich off of oil trade. It may not be the sole reason it could survive beyond 1870s, but with oil exports and other natural resources, it could prove to be invaluable.\n\nIf Texas can survive until 1880s I believe it would be in a position to remain independent to the modern day.\n\nThoughts?\n\nIt's certainly possible for them to survive Britain and France at actually already recognized them, they can still attract large numbers of Germans and Czech immigrants.\n\nThey can have a very different character than the US to the north.\n\nThe Irish famine is soon to happen something else that'll boost their numbers.\n\nIf they survive until 1870 they certainly will remain independent.\n\nWith tensions brewing between France and Prussia, (Franco-Prussian War 1864) and the wars of German unification, Texas could capitalize heavily from these conflicts, coupled with the Irish Famine, Europe would be ripe for agressive Texan recruitment. Even more so, if slavery is outlawed say by the late 1850s.\n\nAs far as Texas- American relations, it would depend on how Texas would view US involvement in Latin America. Even more so, if they somehow annex the Yucatan. If the Mexican- American War is averted, Texas could be a important buffer state between the US and Mexico.\n\nIf Texas is in a position to aid Mexican rebels during the French invasion, I can see Benito Juarez allowing the Rio Grande to be annexed\n\nThe issue is, as far as I remember (someone please correct me if I'm wrong), the Texans were incredibly in debt to France and Britain. It also had the issue of people moving back to the United States due to fear of the Comanche and Mexico. Both of those are going to put a damper on the necessary immigration necessary to form a tax base and diversified economy.\n\nSpeaking of which, the economy is all extraction- cattle, cotton and timber. That's not a stable set up due to fluctuations of international prices. Slavery is another huge issue as it eats away at potential consumers and taxable persons.\n\nHonestly I think your best bet is becoming a British or French client state whose protectorate status ensures its borders are mostly secure, but its economy will be unstable at best until oil comes- though this brings with it the difficulties of the resource curse. But that would probably take a chunk of its borders as there'd need to be some compensation to Mexico.\n\nIf the civil war still happens in 1861, Texas could be in a good position to benefit financially. The CSA could use the Texas ports of Houston and Galveston to ship their cotton to GB and France. It would be both European nations best intetest to help gaurd these shipments as well. Texas could see it self rich by 1865\n\nThat'd probably be enough to fix their balance of payments and cover debt, but not rich per se. The real spike comes during oil, but again, oil is tricky.\n\nI couldn't extrapolate how this goes until you know the factors such as population, literacy rate, technical knowledge, and available capital from banking to self start oil production are. The latter especially, because if Texan oil is owned by firms in New York or London or Paris, most of that money is leaving the country.\n\nKeep in mind that Texas was one of the most enthusiastic pro-slavery states; right up there with the Deep South states (where quite a few Texans came from).\n\nWhy they seceded in the first place, despite their greatest hero, Sam Houston, being strongly opposed.\n\nThey are not going to survive very long after the Southern rebellion ends, simple as that.\n\nThe U.S. has... what reason to invade an independent Texas after an exhausting war of attrition for a good deal of it, exactly? Never mind that the Texians (accurate for the era!) are slavers, so are quite a few nations still at this time.\n\nThe U.S. has... what reason to invade an independent Texas after an exhausting war of attrition for a good deal of it, exactly?

Strategically and politically, that isn't going to go over well for the United States - it's extremely hard to imagine how Texas can stay out of the war, to their tragedy.\n\nAnd if they somehow managed to stay acceptably neutral, the Republic of Texas would be surrounded by two countries that rather detest and hate slavery; that is not is not a good recipe for survival. Best case scenario for Texas would be a voluntary and quick emancipation of their slave population, but that would likely cause economic ruin and moral angst.\n\nOne can assume that the Republic of Texas would aid and abet the Confederacy as much as they can.

Compensation would be just over $146M Dollars. And you can bet they Slavers would want that in Gold, not paper, and payment would need to be immediate\n\nRepublic of Texas couldn't afford that kind of payout"
