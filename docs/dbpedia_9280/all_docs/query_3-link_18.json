What I've seen is that for most schools, a rule of thumb is you can multiply the number of matriculants by 1.5 to 2x to get the number of acceptances, though at some schools that number is closer to 3x.

The review process is not uniform across schools.\n\nAgree. I am certain there are some apps being filtered out based on credentials. Very hard for Baylor to pick someone with a 3.5/500 as an example but it doesn't stop people from applying since it is a single TMDSAS app. UH wont pick someone with 4.0/525 interested in research since they are not offering that in their mission statement.\n\nIf your overall app meets the goal of the school, you are in contention until they run out of slots for interviews. The real issue is that they have only so many interview slots and there can be 2-3 times the people who can be in the ballpark of the interview even if they have 8-10 times the applicants.\n\npurkinjekitty\n\nyeehaw\n\nJoined\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\nMessages\n\n963\n\nReaction score\n\n2,251\n\nAug 5, 2023\n\n#48\n\nDo yall prefer in person or virtual interviews in Texas?
