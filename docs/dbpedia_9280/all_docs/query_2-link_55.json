        "text": "The answers to our Frequently Asked Questions are provided for informational purposes and are not intended to provide legal advice or to substitute for the advice of an attorney. If you have specific legal questions, consult your attorney.\n\n+ Who is eligible to become a notary public?\n\nTo be commissioned as a notary public in Texas, you must be a Texas resident at least 18 years of age who has not received a final conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony.\n\n+ How do I become a notary public?\n\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements, submit the following to the secretary of state:\n\nCompleted Form 2301 (available from the secretary of state, county clerk, or your insurance agency or surety company);\n\nProof of a $10,000 surety bond; and\n\nFiling fee of $21.\n\nOnce you are commissioned, you may purchase your required notary seal and record book from any office supply company.\n\n+ Do I need to return my Notary Public Commission to the Secretary of State's Office once it has been signed and notarized?\n\nNo. The notary public should have their commission available to show when performing notarial services.\n\n+ How do I renew my notary public commission?\n\nTo renew your commission, submit the following to the secretary of state no earlier than 90 days before the expiration of your commission:\n\nCompleted Form 2301 (available from the secretary of state, county clerk, or your insurance agency or surety company);\n\nProof of a $10,000 surety bond; and\n\nFiling fee of $21.\n\n+ May I change my name from the name shown on my Notary Public Commission?\n\nYes. A notary public may change the name on his or her commission by sending the secretary of state a name change application (Form 2305), his or her certificate of commission, a rider or endorsement from the insurance agency or surety showing the name change, and a $20 filing fee.\n\n+ Do I need to keep a record book? What information should be included?\n\nYes. A Texas notary public is required to maintain a record book. This record book must be maintained whether or not any fees are charged for your notary public service. The following information must be included in the record book:\n\nthe date of each instrument notarized;\n\nthe date of the notarization;\n\nthe name of the signer, grantor, or maker;\n\nthe signer's, grantor's, or maker's residence or alleged residence;\n\nwhether the signer, grantor, or maker is personally known by the notary public, was identified by an identification card issued by a United States federal or state governmental agency or a passport issued by the United States, or was introduced to the notary public and, if introduced, the name and residence or alleged residence of the individual introducing the signer, grantor, or maker;\n\nif the instrument is proved by a witness, the residence of the witness, whether the witness is personally known by the notary public or was introduced to the notary public and, if introduced, the name and residence of the individual introducing the witness;\n\nthe name and residence of the grantee;\n\nif land is conveyed or charged by the instrument, the name of the original grantee and the county where the land is located; and\n\na brief description of the instrument.\n\nTex. Gov't Code ยง406.014\n\nThe person for whom a notarization is performed is not required to sign the record book.\n\nA notary should not record any identification number that was assigned by a governmental agency or by the United States to the signer, grantor or maker on an identification card, driver's license, social security card or passport; or any other number that could be used to identify the signer, grantor or maker of the document. 1 TAC ยง87.40. However, a notary is not prohibited from recording a number related to the residence or alleged residence of the signer, grantor or maker of the document or the instrument.\n\n+ Can I get a copy of a notary's record book?\n\nYes. The entries in a notary's record book are public information and a notary is required to provide a certified copy of the record book to any person who requests, and pays the fees for, the copies. Tex. Gov't Code ยง406.014(b), (c). Although not required, the secretary of state suggests that you make all requests in writing, by sending a certified letter to the notary's address. Making your request in this manner provides evidence of the request. Should a notary fail to respond or provide copies, you may file a complaint with this Office and include the evidence of the request as supporting documentation.\n\n+ I am changing jobs and my current employer will not let me take my notary book, seal or commission with me. What should I do?\n\nThe employer is not the owner of a notary's record book or seal, even if the employer paid for the materials. Tex. Atty. Gen. Op. GA-0723. A Texas notary public is required by law to maintain a record book containing information on every notarization performed and is required to authenticate every official act with the seal of office. The record book is public information and a notary is required to produce copies of the book upon request. Therefore, the book and seal should remain in the possession of the notary at all times.\n\nSimilarly the secretary of state issues a commission to the individual notary public for a four-year term, without regard to who paid the application or bond fees. As a result, an employer may not retain the commission of an employee.\n\nIf your employer retains your seal, record book or commission when you leave your job, you should provide your employer a copy of Texas Attorney General Opinion GA-0723. If after receiving a copy of the opinion, your employer still will not let you take your notary book or seal with you, you should make a copy of the pages of the record book so that you can produce them upon request. You should also obtain a new seal and start a new record book for future notarizations. If your employer will not release your commission, you may contact the secretary of state's office for a duplicate copy of the commission.\n\n+ Is a notary public seal required?\n\nYes. A notary public shall provide a seal of office that clearly shows, when embossed, stamped, or printed on a document, the words \"Notary Public, State of Texas\" around a star of five points, the notary public's name, and the date the notary public's commission expires. Notaries public commissioned for the first time on or after January 1, 2016, and notaries public renewing their commissions on or after that date must have their notary ID number on their seal of office. See Section 406.013 of the Texas Government Code as amended by HB 1683 (PDF). The notary public shall authenticate all official acts with the seal of office.\n\n+ I am an online notary public. What if my electronic seal or digital certificate expires or is no longer valid?\n\nAn online notary public must replace an electronic seal or digital certificate that is expired or no longer valid. The notary public shall provide a copy of the new seal or certificate to the secretary of state within 10 days of the replacement.\n\n+ How long should I keep my record book?\n\nA notary is required to keep, in a safe and secure manner, copies of the records of notarizations performed for the longer of: 1) the term of the commission in which the notarization occurred; or 2) three years following the date of notarization. 1 TAC ยง87.54. The best practice, however, would be for the notary to permanently maintain copies of the records.\n\n+ What do I do with my stamp/seal when my commission expires or I am no longer a notary public?\n\nWhen the commission of a notary public expires, or the individual otherwise ceases to be a notary public, the notary seal should be destroyed to prevent possible misuse by another individual.\n\n+ May I notarize my spouse's signature? May I notarize for my spouse's business? May I notarize for my relatives?\n\nThere is no specific prohibition against notarizing a spouse's or relative's signature or notarizing for a spouse's business. However, notarizations should not be performed by a notary public who is a party to the instrument or financially or beneficially interested in the transaction. The facts in each situation will determine whether the notary's action was proper.\n\n+ Can a notary notarize a document in which his or her employer has an interest?\n\nYes. In fact, there are statutes that specifically permit such notarizations. For example, ยง121.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code authorizes an employee of a corporation to take an acknowledgment of a written instrument in which the corporation has an interest. In addition, ยง199.002 of the Texas Finance Code specifies that a notary public is not disqualified from performing a notarization of a document, solely because of the notary public's ownership of stock or participation in or employment by a state trust company that has an interest in the underlying transaction.\n\n+ Is a government employee required to notarize documents for the general public?\n\nNo. The Texas Attorney General's office issued a letter opinion in 1988 indicating that a notary public who is employed by a governmental body may refuse to take acknowledgements for the general public and must refuse when doing so would interfere with the employee's discharge of his or her duties as a public employee. Tex. Atty. Gen. Op. LO-88-34.\n\n+ May I make a certified copy of a birth certificate or a marriage license?\n\nNo. Birth certificates and marriage licenses are publically recordable documents. Recordable documents are recorded with some specific governmental entity, such as the secretary of state's office, a court of law, a county clerk, or the Bureau of Vital Statistics. A certified copy of a recordable document may be obtained by contacting the recording entity. A notary cannot make certified copies of recordable documents.\n\nA notary may, however, make a certified copy of a non-recordable document. A non-recordable document is one that cannot be recorded with any type of governmental entity. For instance, a letter is not recorded with anyone, but there are times the sender of the letter would like to maintain a certified copy of that letter for his or her file.\n\n+ May I take an acknowledgement over the telephone?\n\nNo. The person for whom a notarization is performed must personally appear before the notary public at the time the notarization is performed.\n\n+ May I perform notarial acts in all counties in Texas?\n\nYes. A notary public has statewide jurisdiction and may perform notarial acts in any county in the state of Texas.\n\n+ May a notary public determine which type of notarial certificate should be attached to a document?\n\nNo. A notary public who is not an attorney should only complete a notarial certificate which is already on the document, or type or attach a certificate of the maker's choosing. If a notary public were presented with a document that did not contain a certificate and decided which certificate to attach, that notary public would be \"practicing law.\" Instead, the notary may allow the person for whom the notarization is performed to choose among the sample certificates provided to the notary with the notaryโs commission. The notarial certificate must be in English.\n\nRegardless of which notarial certificate is used and however it is worded, the notary public has a duty to make sure that the information contained in the notarial certificate is a true and accurate reflection of the notarization which the notary performs.\n\n+ May I advertise in a language other than English?\n\nYes, but you must include notice containing the following statement with the advertisement:\n\n\"I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN TEXAS AND MAY NOT GIVE LEGAL ADVICE OR ACCEPT FEES FOR LEGAL ADVICE.\"\n\nIn addition to containing the above statement, the notice must be conspicuous, be in both English and the language of the advertisement, and must include the fees that a notary public may charge.\n\nUse of the phrase \"notario publico\" is prohibited.\n\n+ How much does it cost to get a document notarized?\n\nTexas Government Code ยง406.024 specifies the maximum fees for an official act performed by a notary public. A lesser fee is allowed or no fee at all may be charged. Excessive fees are grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n+ Does the employer or the notary determine the fee charged for notary services performed during the employer's office hours?\n\nTexas Government Code ยง406.024 specifies that the notary public or the notaryโs employer may charge the specified fees.\n\n+ How do I obtain an apostille/certificate on my school transcript or diploma?\n\nPlease visit our Request a Universal Apostille information to learn more about this process.\n\n+ How do I obtain an official certificate or apostille on a notarization?\n\nYou may obtain an official certificate or apostille on a document notarized by a Texas notary public from the Authentications Unit of the secretary of state. Detailed information pertaining to the procedure for requesting certificates or apostilles may be found on our web site.\n\nThe Texas secretary of state cannot provide certification for notaries commissioned outside the state of Texas.\n\n+ What do I do if I lose my seal or notary book?\n\nEvery commissioned notary public has a duty to safeguard his/her notary materials. However, if your notary seal or record book has been misplaced or lost, send a letter to this office detailing the circumstances in which the materials went missing, the last time you used it, and any other relevant information. If any of your notary materials have been stolen, you should file a report with your local law enforcement office and enclose a copy of that report with your letter to this office. Send the letter to the Notary Public Unit, P.O. Box 13375, Austin, Texas 78711-3375 or by email.\n\nRemember that you have a duty to record every notarial act in your record book. Therefore, if your notary record book is lost or stolen, you must get a new book before you resume providing notarial services. Similarly, you must get a new seal if your seal is lost or stolen, as notaries are required to affix their seals to all official acts they perform.\n\n+ Are there restrictions on the way an instrument is signed?\n\nA notary must sign the notarial certificate using the same name that is listed on the commission issued by the secretary of state. However, as long as the name matches, the signature of the notary may be printed, written, typed, stamped, etc.\n\nThe individual signing the document may sign in whatever manner he/she chooses. The name or manner of signing used by the signor is not the responsibility of the notary public. However, the notary public does have a responsibility to make sure that the information contained in the notarial certificate is accurate. For example if John Doe appears before a notary public and signs the instrument with an \"X\" the notary public should still state in the notarial certificate that John Doe personally appeared on a given date.\n\n+ What are the requirements for performing an electronic notarization?\n\n+ Can I complete a Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, on behalf of an employer?\n\nTexas law does not authorize notaries public to certify an I-9 Form, and the Form itself does not contain a notarial certificate. Therefore, notaries should not notarize an I-9 Form. However, it is permissible for a notary public who is an employee of a business to assist that business in filling out the Form - as long as that work is not performed in the employee's capacity as a notary public, and as long as the employee does not place their notary seal on the document.\n\n+ Can a private employer restrict the notarial activities of an employee during work hours?\n\nYes. The Texas Attorney Generalโs office has issued an opinion supporting the authority of a private employer to limit or prohibit the notarial activities of its employees during work hours. Tex. Atty. Gen. Op. GA-0723.\n\n+ Does a Texas notary public have jurisdiction on a U.S. military base or Indian reservation?\n\nMaybe not. Texas notaries have statewide jurisdiction. Gov't Code ยง 406.003. Accordingly, a Texas notary does not appear to be authorized to take an oath or acknowledgement, or perform any other notarial act, on a federal enclave or an Indian reservation. See Tex. Atty. Gen. Op. JC-0390 (2001) (finding that engineers practicing on a federal enclave are not required to be licensed in Texas). Some, but not all military bases are federal enclaves. To find out if a particular military base is a federal enclave, start your search by emailing us to find out if we have record of a deed of cession. If we do not have a deed of cession, it does not necessarily mean it does not exist. You should consult your private attorney to determine whether the property in question was ceded.\n\n+ Are certain statutes regarding appearance before a notary public that were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic still suspended?\n\nNo. The Governor's temporary suspension of section 121.006(c)(1) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code relating to the acknowledgment of real-estate instruments and temporary suspension of certain statutes relating to the execution of a self-proved will, a durable power of attorney, a medical power of attorney, a directive to physician, or an oath of an executor, administrator, or guardian, were terminated effective 12:01 a.m. on September 1, 2021."
