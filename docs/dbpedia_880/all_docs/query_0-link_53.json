        "text": "The goal of this specializing master's is to teach the most important tools and techniques of project and contract management to both engineers and architects. Today it is increasingly important to know how a project should be managed from beginning to end, to optimize costs and time. During this specializing master's, the students will be introduced to the theory of project management, the valuation of investments, and the principles of corporate accounting. Students will receive all the needed information to take the exam and obtain the PMI (Project Management Institute) and IPMA (International Project Management Association) certificates.\n\nThey will also receive all the information necessary to take the exam and obtain the NEBOSH HSE Certificate in Process Safety Management. Students will receive all the information necessary to become a Lean Green Belt Project Leader, and also all the information necessary to become certified project managers in Italy through Accredia. Besides all those PM tools, this specializing master will also provide more specific concepts of contract, claims, and delays management in civil and infrastructural works. The need for technicians (engineers and/or architects) who become competent in the management of contracts and claims and who can perform a delay analysis in accordance with commonly applied international standards is increasingly urgent among the major general contractors in Italy and abroad. Our globalized world requires that professionals involved in contract and dispute management know how to deal with complex technical issues and at the same time know the legal aspects involved. It is essential for professionals with a purely technical background to know the \"rules of the game\" in the international arena. Therefore, they should know the fundamental principles of civil and common law, as well as international arbitration, together with the most widely used international contracts (FIDIC, JCT, NEC, AAA) and the many complex technical and legal details in the analysis and management of delays and construction variants.\n\nThe job opportunities offered to those who have acquired the knowledge and tools presented during this specializing master's lessons are multiple and varied: construction companies, engineering companies, real estate developers, general contractors, public bodies, etc. They need and are constantly looking for project managers who have studied in depth the legal aspects useful for accurate and efficient management of contracts, claims, delays, and disputes. Many renowned general contractors, engineering companies, and large manufacturers have already confirmed that they are extremely interested in hiring technicians equipped with the skills and knowledge that this specializing master will provide.\n\nMaster Degree in e-Learning Mode\n\nEach student will have access to her/his own personal account on the Moodle e-learning platform (which is among the most widely used platform globally for online lifelong learning). Here the student will find all the videos of the lessons in streaming, all the teaching material downloadable as pdf files, the calendar of the lessons, and the contacts of all the teachers.\n\nThrough her/his own personal account each student will be able to follow the lessons in two ways: the Synchronous Way while the lessons will be made in the classroom and the student will be able to participate as if she/he were present; and the Asynchronous Way after the videos of the lessons, the teaching material, and the contacts of the teacher will be uploaded on the platform, and there will remain at disposal of all the students every hour of the day, every day of the week, and for the whole duration of the master.\n\nTherefore, even after the end of the lessons, all the students will have many more months to access their personal accounts on the platform and delve as deep as they deem necessary and useful into the contents of all the lessons. Until they write and defend their master thesis, and finally graduate.\n\nDidactic Modules\n\nFundamentals of management engineering:\n\nThe unit aims to bring the student closer to the fundamentals of management engineering. In particular, the focus will be on external accounting - balance sheet with related documents, elementary accounting operations, reading the balance sheet and indices - on internal accounting - management control and main techniques, short-term balance, and break-even analysis. Attention is also paid to the valuation of investments, DCF, and non-DCF valuation methods; to supply chain planning - outbound logistics, production, supplier evaluation and planning, and control cycle; finally on project management - organization by projects, reticular control techniques, planning, and re-planning.\n\nNEBOSH International General Certificate course:\n\nThe unit aims to provide technical skills of risk assessment, identification of preventive measures, planning, design of procedures to prevent or reduce risks during the execution of works, identification of critical phases, ability to coordinate activities to avoid dangerous interference, emergency management (fire - accident - earthquake - attacks - natural disasters in general). The unit provides all the information needed to take and successfully pass the exam to achieve the NEBOSH certificate, which is the British Standard for safety in and arrangement of construction sites.\n\nAn introduction to value averaging:\n\nEvery person / professional should plan her / his financial situation as a company does: the turnover corresponds to the salary of a person, the company costs correspond to the living costs of the person and her / his family, the fcf (free cash flow) of a company corresponds to the cash that a person manages to save every month. Just as a company must invest its fcf to grow, so also a person needs to know how to invest her / his savings in order to generate a financially solid and secure situation in the long term. A value averaging investment strategy is useful to achieve such a goal.\n\nProject Management Certification PMI (CAPM® e PMP®):\n\nThe unit aims to prepare students to obtain the prestigious certifications issued by PMI®, helping to understand the fundamental approaches, methods, and techniques of the PMBOK® Guide. The course is structured in modules and includes classroom days and exercises for the application of the techniques. The course is valid as compulsory training for eligibility in the CAPM® and PMP® exams.\n\nIPMA® International Project Management Certification (Level D, Level C, Level B, Level A):\n\nThe unit aims to train students according to the IPMA (International Project Management Association) skills model called ICB® (Individual Competence Baseline).\n\nIn addition to the technical and methodological skills of the PM, the ICB also covers those defined as \"behavioral\" and \"contextual\".\n\nThe IPMA model provides 15 behavioral skills that the PM must develop as well as those of a technical nature. Leadership results in orientation, openness, negotiation, reliability, conflict and crisis management are some of the behavioral skills that are treated within this teaching unit.\n\nThe unit provides also the discussion of elements defined as \"contextual\" that complete the skills of a PM (finance, legal, hsse, technology, business, permanent organization, etc.).\n\nThe course offers the opportunity to access the Level D IPMA certification which does not require working experience prerequisites, or to higher levels, if the participant meets the working experience prerequisites.\n\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt Project Leader:\n\nThe Lean organizational model and the Six Sigma problem-solving methodology represent two important tools for all those companies that wish to improve their performance, thus introducing a continuous improvement program for their workforce. The Green Belt Project Leader training allows course participants to conduct improvement projects within companies and at the same time to develop their own project management skills. Lean Six Sigma projects improve business processes and offer the opportunity to acquire cross-functional skills essential for holding managerial roles. It is no coincidence that General Electric, one of the companies that have helped to develop the Six Sigma methodology in the first place, used this training path to make its managers grow and improve. The management and data analysis skills acquired through a Green Belt Project Leader course are the key to achieving high levels of competitiveness and, together with digitalization, provide the main founding elements of Industry 4.0.\n\nReal estate valuation and valorization:\n\nThe unit is divided into two main parts.\n\nThe first one, dealing with real estate valuation, is made up of four modules organized into two parts:\n\nframework of the problem, from a technical, economic and managerial point of view;\n\ncase studies, as widely documented and presented by representatives of well-known companies in the real estate sector.\n\nThe second part of the course deals with the tools and methods for real estate valorization. This part aims at presenting the process of real estate valorization, illustrating the methodologies and the technical, economic, and managerial means that might lead to the best practices and results.\n\nThe unit is sponsored by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).\n\nThe unit will be held by professors of the Politecnico di Milano, by some experts in the real estate sector, and will benefit from the contribution of leading representatives of some of the most important companies and/or organizations operating in the real estate sector (CBRE and Generali Real Estate, Beni Stabili Siiq, Generali Real Summer and Royal Value Sgr.)\n\nHow to become a certified project manager:\n\nThe new procurement code, the ANAC Guidelines No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, and the DPCM scheme for the definition of the technical and organizational requirements for registration in the list of qualified contracting stations (art.38, paragraph 2 of Legislative Decree 50 of 2016) of February 2018, actually emphasizes the importance of project management activities both for ORs and for professionals involved in civil and infrastructural works and/or engineering and architectural services.\n\nAnd that is why there is the possibility of being certified as project managers in accordance with Law 4/2013 and the UNI 11648:2016 Standard and is registered in the appropriate Accredia list.\n\nBut how can you become a certified project manager according to the law and the aforementioned standards? Admittedly, the process for potential candidates is often confusing; what are the steps to be taken in order to achieve this certification, what is the optimal path to follow, and which prospects can a project management certification offer?\n\nThis didactic module aims at providing all the necessary information for adequate participation in the exam for the so-called \"Third-party certification\" of project management in compliance with Law 4/2013 and UNI 11648:2016. This exam is to be carried out by a Body of Certification officially recognized and accredited by Accredia. Certified PMs will be registered in the appropriate Accredia register, as required by law.\n\nThis unit first introduces the students to the law and regulations. The teacher will explain with adequate documentation the reasons why it is convenient to become a certified project manager and to be included in the appropriate list of Accredia, both for the ORs, for professionals, for engineering companies, and companies in general. In fact, in all those contracts managed with the criteria of the most economically advantageous offer, both for construction works and for architectural/engineering services, the scores assigned to the organizational aspects in any bid tend to be higher if and when certified project manager figures are involved.\n\nFinally, for the purpose of adequate alignment with a course about project management in the field of civil and infrastructural works, the teacher will discuss case studies in which the teacher himself has been a project manager or consultant for project management activities. These case studies are meant to give the students practical knowledge that might turn out to be very useful during the exam to become a certified project manager.\n\nConstruction Contract Civil Law:\n\nIn-depth analysis of the Construction Contract (“Appalto”) for private works.
