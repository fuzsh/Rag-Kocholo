        "text": "MILAN: A consortium led by Salini Impregilo Group has won a 963 million euro ($1.29 billion) contract to build part of a new coastal highway in Libya, in a sign of a rapidly growing order book for the soon-to-be merged group.\n\nImpregilo and Salini are completing a tie-up to create a global construction player focused on large civil engineering projects from roads to hydroelectric dams in over 60 countries, including the Middle East, the Americas and Australia.\n\nWhile shareholders are expected to clear the merger only in September, the companies have already set up joint structures to bid for tenders under the name Salini Impregilo.\n\nThe stock rose more than 3 percent on the Libya announcement to reach an 11-week high and was up 3.42 percent at 3.5 euros by 1323 GMT, outperforming a 0.16 percent fall in the Dow Jones global industrials index.\n\nSalini Impregilo has a 58 percent stake in the contract.\n\n“We believe this new intake in Libya might pave the way for the execution of the currently frozen “Lidco” backlog (1 billion euros), which relates to infrastructure jobs in the country,” Kepler Cheuvreux, which has a “buy” rating on the stock, said in a note.\n\nThe Salini Impregilo consortium, which also includes Italian firms La Societ‡ Italiana per Condotte díAcqua, Impresa Pizzarotti & C. and Cooperativa Muratori & Cementisti, will build the first 400 km section of the highway from the city of Marj in Libya to Emsaad, on the Egyptian border.\n\nThe project was initially awarded more than two years ago to a consortium led by Italian oil services group Saipem, following a tender in which Impregilo also participated.\n\nThat contract, however, was never formally signed before the civil war erupted in 2011, a source close to the matter said.\n\nThe source added that Saipem had asked to renegotiate the price for its contract, which was set at 835 million euros, following the conflict.\n\nThis led to the body that manages the project going into private talks with the various original bidders and awarding the contract to Salini Impregilo.\n\nNeither Saipem, which is 43-percent owned by oil major Eni, nor Impregilo were able to comment.\n\nThe Salini Impregilo contract is part of an accord signed between the governments of Italy and Libya in 2008 and will be funded by the Italian government.\n\nThe entire highway will run across Libya for 1,700 km between the Tunisian and Egyptian borders.\n\nThe contract comes at a time when investor enthusiasm in Libya has been dampened by renewed security concerns, even though the country has the money to pay for its vast infrastructure, health and education needs."
