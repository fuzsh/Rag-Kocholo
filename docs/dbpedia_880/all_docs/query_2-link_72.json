        "text": "Lord Verdirame KC specialises in public international law, international arbitration (especially investment treaty arbitration and inter-state arbitration), human rights and constitutional law. His practice covers the full range of public international law including international dispute resolution; immunities; foreign investment protection; law of the sea; territorial and maritime boundary disputes; status of territories; human rights; use of force; law of armed conflict; international organisations; sanctions; trade.\n\nGuglielmo is in very high demand as counsel in international arbitration, and he is particularly sought-after by investors and states for his extensive expertise and experience in investment arbitration (under BITs, ECT or investment chapters of FTAs). He has been instructed as lead counsel or counsel in many investment treaty disputes (not all in the public domain – for those that are see list below). On the investor side of his practice recent highlights include winning a ca. US$650 million investment claim in Diag Human SE and Josef Stava v Czech Republic, PCA Case 2018-20. On the state side, they include successfully defending Ukraine from a US$6 billion Energy Charter Treaty claim, Kenya from a US$2 billion BIT claim, and the Hellenic Republic from a ca €400 million claim.\n\nThe arbitrations in which he is currently instructed range in value from hundreds of millions to several billions USD. He has worked with counsel and legal experts from dozens of different jurisdictions (both common law and civil law), and has acted in arbitral proceedings under the main institutional rules (ICSID, ICSID- Additional Facility, PCA, UNCITRAL, ICC, SCC, LCIA, Court of Arbitration for Sport).\n\nGuglielmo regularly advise States on inter-state disputes and acts as counsel before international courts and tribunals in such disputes (including before the ICJ, ITLOS, Annex VII Tribunal under UNCLOS, the ECHR). He is counsel for Ukraine in the case brought by Ukraine against Russia in the ECHR in respect of human rights violations committed by Russia after February 2022. He was counsel for the UK in the ICJ in a dispute concerning obligations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (Marshall Islands v UK), and for the Italian Republic in the Enrica Lexie Incident dispute before both the UN Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the arbitral tribunal in the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nGuglielmo has a particularly busy advisory practice for governments, including the British Government. He is regularly instructed to advise on complex legal matters in very sensitive political, economic and diplomatic contexts (including diplomatic negotiations and political disputes). In this role, he has advised (current and former) heads of government, government ministers and senior law officers, as well as the CEOs and boards of multinational corporations.\n\nGuglielmo is regularly instructed in cases involving international law in the English courts. He has appeared before the High Court (KBD, especially Admin Court and Commercial Court, and Family Division), Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. He is currently counsel for the defendants in Czech Republic v Diag Human and Josef Stava (the leading challenge, involving ss. 67, 68 and 73 of the Arbitration Act 1996, to an investment treaty award in the English Courts). He is regularly instructed, including by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and the UK Ministry of Defence, in cases concerning immunities, treaties, the effect of international obligations, and armed conflict. He was counsel for the government in the first Miller case on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, and for the UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights in the Shamima Begum case. He was also counsel for HRH Princess Haya of Jordan in the widely reported proceedings between her and the Prime Minister of the UAE, which have led to very important judgments on the immunity of heads of government and on foreign act of State.\n\nWhile he works mainly as counsel, Guglielmo has also sat as arbitrator.\n\nGuglielmo is a Professor of International Law at King’s College London but only on a part-time basis since 2018. In the past, he was a Fellow of the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law at the University of Cambridge; a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford; and a Visiting Professorial Fellow at Harvard Law School and a Visiting Professor at Columbia Law School. He has published extensively in the field of public international law, and sits on the Advisory Board of the American Review of International Arbitration. He is working on two books: one on the relationship between international law and national law; and the other (entitled “Can Liberty Last?”) on the future of political liberty.\n\nLord Verdirame KC is a (non-party affiliated) member of the House of Lords, where he focuses on debates and legislation within his wider field of expertise (international law, foreign affairs and defence, arbitration, constitutional law and the protection of fundamental liberties).\n\nPrivacy notice"
