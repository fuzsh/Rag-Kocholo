Commissario di governo contro il dissesto idrogeologico The Figline flood retention basin project is part of the interventions of the more complex Plan relating to the reduction of the hydraulic risk of the Arno river basin: the Plan aims to obtain an important effect in reducing maximum flood peak value in the urban area of Florence, through the creation of controlled flooding areas along the Arno river and its tributaries. The preliminary design of the works is part of a wider system of works for the attenuation of the floods, upstream of Florence city, consisting of 5 expansion reservoirs. The goal is to laminate the floods of the River Arno to allow transit of a maximum of 3400 m³ in Florence's urban center, at Ponte Vecchio. The Figline flood retention basin is located in the right floodplain of the Arno river, about 25 km upstream; its internal surface measures 134 ha, divided into two partitions for a total capacity volume of about 7.1 million m³, obtained by excavating at an average depth of 1.5 m (about 58 ha). The current embankments of the River Arno are not suitable for guaranteeing water tightness and stability and therefore will be reconstructed with the soils coming from the excavations, for a total volume of 1.31 million of m³. The services offered by BETA Studio concern geotechnical and seismic surveys, executive design, and work supervision.

ITALY 2020 2020 DRR CIV Hydrogeological and hydraulic study of water runoff aiming to reducing the impacts affecting infrastructures of Piovene Rocchette and Santorso municipalities (Vicenza province) VIACQUA s.p.a. The territories of Piovene Rocchette and Santorso (VI) were subject to intense events between July and August 2019, with flooding of the inhabited centers due to the insufficiency of the hydrographic network that drains hydrographic basins of modest size but with high slopes. The aim of the study is the definition of flood flows for different proability (5 to 200 years) as well as the dynamics of flood propagation and mapping of flooded areas. The results will then be used to identify hydraulic risk mitigation interventions and their benefits. For this purpose, two-dimensional mathematical models (InfoWorks ICM, HEC-RAS) will be implemented on the basis of the hydrological data and topographic data collected and processed. We will then proceed with the definition of the interventions identified by evaluating any macro project alternatives; the level of detail will be such as to be able to evaluate the technical feasibility of the solutions and to determine the cost estimate. Each intervention proposal will also be analyzed through the cost-benefit analysis.
