The project, conceived with the aim of promoting the healthcare of those communities that live in the areas the company works in, with the collaboration of local stakeholders and on the basis of the Countryâs policies, is linked to the national vaccination strategy set by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Congo for the 5-year period 2016-2020 (Programme Elargi de Vaccination - PEV). More specifically, the projectâs objective is to contribute to the reduction of the incidence of the major endemic diseases, on one hand, according with Progerâs competences, through the strengthening of CSI plants and, on the other hand, through the organization and management of a customized awareness campaign. This will be mainly addressed to children and mothers: in this regard a prompt action is particularly important because it is decisive for the future of the country, and it will involve the surrounding population during the implementation phase of the program, by favouring the creation of professional opportunities for the local communities.

This participation confirms Progerâs interest and attention - witnessed also by the three-year sponsorship of the Chieti Team - to the link between corporate culture and sport culture as a lever able to convey important values, create synergies and offer new opportunities.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nRoad âPedemontana Aspromonte Tirrenicoâ\n\nReggio Calabria, Italy â Proger has been awarded, together with the company Cosedil S.p.A., with the detailed design and works [...]\n\nRoad âPedemontana Aspromonte Tirrenicoâ Reggio Calabria, Italy - Proger has been awarded, together with the company Cosedil S.p.A., with the detailed design and works execution on the basis of the final design of the road Pedemontana dellâAspromonte Tirrenico, linking the mountain municipalities of Cinquefrondi, San Giorgio Morgeto and Cittanova (province of Reggio Calabria), connecting the former main road 111 and the âStrada di Grande Comunicazioneâ crossing the ridge between the Ionian coast and the Plains of Rosarno. With reference to the project, one of the main aspects of the technical offer developed during the tender stage referred to the operating process proposed for the completion of the viaducts structures partially built and abandoned between the \\'80s and the \\'90s. In this regard, due to the poor knowledge of the types of underpinning already built, of the mechanical characteristics of the concrete and of the reinforcement rods at its inside, Proger has proposed the abandon of the existing substructures and the realization of brand new works for three out of four viaducts of the section. As per the Macario viaduct, the most important of the lot, the reuse of the existing piers and abutments has been studied, after the optimization of the design of dosserets, which will be lighter because fully in steel. This solution ensures a general behaviour of the viaducts in case of seismic events, a longer overall lastingness, better safety and a clear simplification for the construction stages. Finally, the offer has been completed with some technical improvements and with the identification of a series of additional interventions in the territories of the surrounding Municipalities, in order to benefit road users and to emphasize the territory.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nProger joins the World Trade Centers Association\n\nPescara, Italy â Proger has signed an agreement for the acquisition of the 49% of the World Trade Center Pescara/Chieti, [...]\n\nProger joins the World Trade Centers Association Pescara, Italy - Proger has signed an agreement for the acquisition of the 49% of the World Trade Center Pescara/Chieti, joining the main worldwide independent association for the international trade.
