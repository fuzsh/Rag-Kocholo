Architetti Associati, MANENS-TIFS and Studio VALLE Progetti, was awarded the final design of the new Istat (Italian National Institute of Statistics) headquarters after winning the Design Competition – out of 17 competing groups – in 2019. The new Istat Headquarters will be built in the Pietralata area in Rome. The design strategies focused their attention on the relationships with the city and its flows, with the aim to contribute, through the design of public spaces, to a better overall quality of the urban environment. The project is characterised by “openness and permeability” criteria, allowing, on one hand, a great flexibility in the use of the facilities annexed to the offices – so that they can be shared by the community – and, on the other hand, offering articulated and modular spaces within the building and the working environments. The building structure will consist of a two-storey basement, intended for ancillary activities (entrance hall, library and historical archive, Museum of statistics, refreshment area, kindergarten, gym and conference centre), from the overlying 8-storey L-shaped building, intended for offices, and two underground floors, dedicated to parking and the technological centre. All enriched with a double square, namely a pedestrian square at zero altitude and the other located on a 9-meter higher terrace, which will host a “hanging forest”, open to the public. The project applied the best bioclimatic and energy efficiency strategies and maximized the use of renewable energy sources, providing protection systems for direct solar radiation for all the facades, accumulation and release systems of the accumulated thermal load, along with passive bioclimatic systems based on convective loops (passive heating and cooling).\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nAwarded to the JV led by Proger the surveillance activities of the ASPI network works\n\nProger, in JV with Bureau Veritas Nexta, Tecno Piemonte and Tecnolab, was awarded by Autostrade per l’Italia the tender for [...]\n\nAwarded to the JV led by Proger the surveillance activities of the ASPI network works Proger, in JV with Bureau Veritas Nexta, Tecno Piemonte and Tecnolab, was awarded by Autostrade per l’Italia the tender for the surveillance of the works related to the network managed by Aspi falling within the national territory.

The work starts from the Western Ring Road of the city and involves the municipalities of Vicenza and Costabissarra. The section, that presents two intersections with the state highway 46, extends for about 5,300 m. With reference to the final project as in tender specifications, a number of technical improvements have been examined, such as the optimization of soundproof barriers on the viaduct of the Viale del Sole junction, the establishment of some rest areas long the service routes that will create a real tourist path with information panels for cyclists and pedestrians and particular environmental mitigations that foresee the introduction of special arrangements for the roundabouts and the viaduct, in order to enhance the historical and cultural promotion of the territory.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nOne year support to a vaccination centre in Congo\n\nPointe Noire, Congo – Proger has signed a partnership agreement with the Health Department of the Kouilou Region, in Congo, [...]\n\nOne year support to a vaccination centre in Congo Pointe Noire, Congo - Proger has signed a partnership agreement with the Health Department of the Kouilou Region, in Congo, to support for one year a vaccination centre in Pointe Noire: the CSI (Integrated Health Centre) of Mpita, a densely populated borough of the city. The project, conceived with the aim of promoting the healthcare of those communities that live in the areas the company works in, with the collaboration of local stakeholders and on the basis of the Country’s policies, is linked to the national vaccination strategy set by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Congo for the 5-year period 2016-2020 (Programme Elargi de Vaccination - PEV). More specifically, the project’s objective is to contribute to the reduction of the incidence of the major endemic diseases, on one hand, according with Proger’s competences, through the strengthening of CSI plants and, on the other hand, through the organization and management of a customized awareness campaign. This will be mainly addressed to children and mothers: in this regard a prompt action is particularly important because it is decisive for the future of the country, and it will involve the surrounding population during the implementation phase of the program, by favouring the creation of professional opportunities for the local communities. Proger has been working in Congo since 2009 and, thanks to this initiative, it confirms once more the attention it addresses to the realization of sustainable, efficient and responsible social projects in those countries where it works, trying to positively impact the development of the hosting communities.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nTeambuilding on the basket court\n\nRome, Italy – Proger has attended the event “Basket Execution & Teambuilding Experience” organized by CFMT (Training Centre for Managers), [...]\n\nTeambuilding on the basket court Rome, Italy - Proger has attended the event “Basket Execution & Teambuilding Experience” organized by CFMT (Training Centre for Managers), held in Rome last 8th June at the Eurobasket sports centre, with coach Valerio Bianchini, the first coach who has ever won three championships in Italy with three different teams.

This participation confirms Proger’s interest and attention - witnessed also by the three-year sponsorship of the Chieti Team - to the link between corporate culture and sport culture as a lever able to convey important values, create synergies and offer new opportunities.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nRoad ‘Pedemontana Aspromonte Tirrenico’\n\nReggio Calabria, Italy – Proger has been awarded, together with the company Cosedil S.p.A., with the detailed design and works [...]\n\nRoad ‘Pedemontana Aspromonte Tirrenico’ Reggio Calabria, Italy - Proger has been awarded, together with the company Cosedil S.p.A., with the detailed design and works execution on the basis of the final design of the road Pedemontana dell’Aspromonte Tirrenico, linking the mountain municipalities of Cinquefrondi, San Giorgio Morgeto and Cittanova (province of Reggio Calabria), connecting the former main road 111 and the “Strada di Grande Comunicazione” crossing the ridge between the Ionian coast and the Plains of Rosarno. With reference to the project, one of the main aspects of the technical offer developed during the tender stage referred to the operating process proposed for the completion of the viaducts structures partially built and abandoned between the \\'80s and the \\'90s. In this regard, due to the poor knowledge of the types of underpinning already built, of the mechanical characteristics of the concrete and of the reinforcement rods at its inside, Proger has proposed the abandon of the existing substructures and the realization of brand new works for three out of four viaducts of the section. As per the Macario viaduct, the most important of the lot, the reuse of the existing piers and abutments has been studied, after the optimization of the design of dosserets, which will be lighter because fully in steel. This solution ensures a general behaviour of the viaducts in case of seismic events, a longer overall lastingness, better safety and a clear simplification for the construction stages. Finally, the offer has been completed with some technical improvements and with the identification of a series of additional interventions in the territories of the surrounding Municipalities, in order to benefit road users and to emphasize the territory.\n\nLeggi tutto\n\nProger joins the World Trade Centers Association\n\nPescara, Italy – Proger has signed an agreement for the acquisition of the 49% of the World Trade Center Pescara/Chieti, [...]\n\nProger joins the World Trade Centers Association Pescara, Italy - Proger has signed an agreement for the acquisition of the 49% of the World Trade Center Pescara/Chieti, joining the main worldwide independent association for the international trade.
