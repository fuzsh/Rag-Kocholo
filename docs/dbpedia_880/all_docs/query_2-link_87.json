        "text": "Greenpipe, as a specialist in linear drainage, was contacted by the technicians of the Tiliaventum consortium in April 2017 to design and manufacture 6 km of drainage channels with the following characteristics:\n\nrectangular prefabricated concrete channel with 35×35 cm internal dimensions complete with class D400 cast iron gratings, for surface water collection, CE marked\n\nrectangular prefabricated concrete channel with 35×35 cm internal dimensions with “draining” side inserts complete with class D400 cast iron gratings, for surface water collection, CE marked\n\nwith a clear preponderance of the second model.\n\nIn addition to these technical characteristics, a product had to be conceived which did not exceed project costs.\n\nIn 2005 the project for the “upgrading of the A4 motorway from Quarto d’Altino (VE) to Villesse (GO) with a third lane” was approved – a complex project divided into various phases, lots and sub-lots.\n\nWork on the third lot and part of the fourth, from Alvisopoli (VE) to Gonars (UD), began on 9 January 2017 with the laying of the foundation stone in the presence, among others, of the Minister for Infrastructure Graziano Delrio and the Presidents of the Veneto Region Luca Zaia and the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region Debora Serracchiani.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Tiliaventum, a consortium company made up of two of Italy’s leading construction companies, Rizzani de Eccher and Impresa Pizzarotti & C., and involved a major commitment and some very large figures:\n\n400 million euro\n\n26 km di new motorway lane\n\n11 municipalities involved\n\n8 rebuilt overpasses\n\n11 rebuilt underpasses\n\n2 rebuilt bridges over 100 metres long (over the river Stella and over the Cormor canal)\n\n1 bridge rebuilt over the Tagliamento river (1,500 metres long)\n\nThese are the numbers which Greenpipe put in place to satisfy Tiliaventum’s requirements: a job which contributed to the completion of a major project not only for north-eastern Italy but also for “the modernization and development of the country as a whole”."
