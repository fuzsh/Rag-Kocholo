The overall shopping district will cover roughly 300,000 square meters including green areas and more than 5,100 parking spaces.\n\nMore than 30% of the total gross lettable area has already been leased by Italian and international brands.\n\nDelivery is scheduled for autumn 2019.\n\nPart of the project's cost is financed by a pool of banks represented by UniCredit as bank agent together with Banca IMI and Banco BPM.\n\nSonae Sierra develops, invests in and manages retail assets across the world and is a controlling shareholder of Sonae Sierra Brasil SA.\n\nImpresa Pizzarotti operates internationally in infrastructure, energy and construction."
