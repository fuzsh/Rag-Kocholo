        "text": "According to the definition of ocse, social innovation is the design and implementation of new solutions that involve “conceptual, process, product or organizational changes, the ultimate goal of which is to improve the well-being of individuals and communities”.\n\nOur objective is to pursue a new mind-set based on “profit for purpose” perspective where social sustainability, applied to the community, is based on innovation that pays attention to the scarcity of resources and not to their surplus (innovation of sense) in order to transform the current “trade-offs” into “trade-ons”.\n\nANTI-COLLISION, FOR EVERYONE’S SAFETY\n\nThe installation of specific devices on the construction site and on the machine allows controlling in real time the situations which, especially within small workspaces (tunnels, excavations, yards), can generate immediate danger of collision between people and machines. When a worker enters the operating range of a machine and gets too close, so much so as to put their safety at risk, the installed devices raise the alarm and, in the most critical cases, reduce or cut the power to the engines or to the control units.\n\nOur reference interlocutor is the territory, in the broadest sense of the term: this includes not only geographical locations but also all the stakeholders who are part of it.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, the creation of infrastructure always brings economic and social benefits, but it must be conducted responsibly and taking local peculiarities into consideration, especially in heavily anthropized countries, rich in history and cultural and landscape traditions.\n\nIn concrete terms, our group carries out a constant and transparent dialogue with the territory, to prevent any critical issues linked to the construction site of a work, and creates employment and related activities opportunities. Furthermore, with the support of fondazione pizzarotti, we promote a culture of collaboration, to contribute to improving people’s living conditions.\n\nPeople are at the center of our value system and the progetto benessere represents the virtuous declination of company policies that we renew year after year, adapting new initiatives to the changing needs.\n\nThe group’s policies aim to promote an increasingly smart and inclusive work environment, with a view to improving the work-life balance of all employees with a particular focus on protected categories and female staff."
