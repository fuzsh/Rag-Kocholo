It was a great experience to learn different playing styles and I believe it betters your rugby.\n\n“After the Series I was selected for the U18 programme where I went on to captain the U18 team at the Six Nations Festival. I was also selected for the U18 7s programme and went to Rome with the Scottish Futures to play in the Tri-Nations Series.”"
