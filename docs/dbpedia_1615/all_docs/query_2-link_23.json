        "text": "Welcome to Cabot Citrus Farms, Cabot’s first American property in its diverse collection of world-class golf.\n\nLocated in the central-west region of Florida, aptly known as the Nature Coast, Cabot Citrus Farms is set across 1,200-acres of pristine natural beauty. Boasting dramatic elevation changes, sandy soil, and rolling hills canopied by towering sand pines, palmetto trees, and century-old moss-covered oaks, the unique landscape is truly enchanting. Previously known as World Woods Golf Club, the newly acquired Cabot property will re-emerge as a vibrant destination known for incredible golf and world-class real-estate, surrounded by a serene natural landscape.\n\nIt features two revitalized 18-hole golf courses, one 9-hole course, an 11-hole par-3 course, a new clubhouse and an unparalleled practice facility. In addition to golf, the property will offer accommodations, real estate, food and beverage offerings, and a Sporting Club."
