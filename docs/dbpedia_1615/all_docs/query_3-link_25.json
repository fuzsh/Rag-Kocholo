        "text": "HIST 100 Topics in Western Civilization (4)\n\nTopics and themes related to the development and impact of Western civilization upon the human community. This subject will be analyzed through an intensive examination of a specific historical theme, issue or period. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 111 Religion and Power in the Pre-Modern West (4)\n\nTwo principles central to modern American culture are \"separation of church and state\" and individual freedom of religious choice. For most of Western history, however, these principles would have been largely incomprehensible. This course examines the close relationship between religion and \"the state\" in ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and medieval Europe, analyzing the ways in which they reinforced each other as well as instances in which they came into conflict. More broadly, the course examines ways in which religion reinforced or challenged social norms relating to gender, hierarchy, and the identification of \"insiders\" and marginalized groups. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 112 Women Changing the World: Gender and Social Movements (4)\n\nThis course examines women's participation in social and political movements throughout the world since the late eighteenth century in order to understand how gender (the set of beliefs each culture has regarding male and female difference) has affected women's involvement. The course explores a variety of gender-based arguments that women have used to bring social change, assessing whether these approaches are effective or ultimately limit women to a narrow range of issues. Some attention is paid to how gender affects men's involvement in social movements. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 113 Civil Disobedience from Ancient Greece to Modern Africa (4)\n\nThis course examines how acts of civil disobedience have affected the course of world history from ancient through modern times. It explores how the emergence of democratic government and Christianity formed the foundation of civil disobedience. Sophocles, Perpetua, Thomas Paine, Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela are women and men who affected the course of history by challenging laws, customs and conventions that they believed to be immoral. The course investigates both common and distinctive methods employed by these historical actors in challenging various systems of oppression that emerged as communities and societies organized into nation states. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 114 Health and Illness in History: Reading and Writing about Disease in American History (4)\n\nAn introduction to the history of medicine by examining the way diseases have been documented and discussed by patients, family members, and medical professionals in the past. Students will read medical narratives produced during and about various periods in United States history. They will study how such narratives have changed the way historians think about the history of medicine and, in some cases, how Americans think of themselves and their relationship to illness, the healthcare profession, and medical research.\n\nHIST 116 Revolution and Evolution: Europe since the Eighteenth Century (4)\n\nThis course analyzes the origins and development of the political and industrial revolutions that began to affect Europe in the late eighteenth century and addresses how Europeans responded to their impact.

Using art, fiction, popular entertainments, travel writing as well as works by historians, the course focuses on early encounters between indigenous and European peoples, the importance of stories of discovery in politics and culture, and Americans' efforts to describe and assign value to the natural environment as the United States emerged as a nation and world power in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 120 Children and Childhood in History (4)\n\nThis course focuses on the lived experiences of children and traces the emergence of a new \"ideology of childhood\" in the early modern world (c. 1300 to 1800). The course examines the major social, political and economic changes that unfolded throughout this period, including related programs of religious, scientific, and educational reform, and studies how these changes affected children's roles or status within families and communities-in-transition. It also asks whether a fundamental change in the meaning of childhood by 1800 corresponded to the emergence of an increasingly global, colonial, and industrial world order. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 121 Consumer Culture and Its Discontents, 17th - 20th Centuries (4)\n\nThis course examines the development of a consumer culture from the seventeenth to the late twentieth centuries in Europe and around the globe. \"Consumerism\" is used to encompass a constellation of historical changes, including the shift from a mercantilistic to free market system of capitalistic exchange, the advent of mass production, and innovations in retailing and marketing. The course analyzes how the increasing organization of life around seemingly infinite flows and accumulations of commodities affected political, social and cultural life as well as individual behavior and value systems. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 122 Science, Society, and the Archives (4)\n\nThis course studies the sciences and their histories as social practices. Focusing on the cultural meanings and politics of scientific work in many different contexts, special attention is given to the early modern period of global history.

Taking a global perspective, the course argues that events in one part of the world cannot be understood in isolation—that events in Europe, for example, affected and were influenced by incidents in Asia, Africa, or the U.S. Topics include the two world wars, the fall of empires, the Cold War, the roles of important personalities, and recent events in China, central and southern Asia, and the Middle East. Open only to new first-year students.\n\nHIST 125 The Age of Discovery: Encounter of Two Worlds (4)\n\nThe course delves into the intellectual, social and cultural aspects of the Native American/European encounter in what came to be called Latin America in the first century after the arrival of Columbus. It examines such facets as the underlying religious and political legitimation of the Iberian conquests, indigenous responses, and the issue of \"othering\" and mutual perceptions.

Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 126 Into the Heart of Darkness: Imperialism in the 19th and 20th Centuries (4)\n\nThis class investigates the controversial history of European empires since 1800 to understand how imperialism has shaped the modern world.

Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 127 Atlantic Britons, 1500-1850 (4)\n\nThis course examines the period after 1500 when the people of the British Isles began to explore the world beyond their shores, to encounter unfamiliar cultures and peoples, and to exploit resources and peoples in Africa and the Americas. It considers the understandings and agendas the British brought to these encounters and how interactions with distant lands and peoples altered the way the British saw themselves and their own culture before and after the political crisis of 1776 that ruptured the empire they created. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 128 Adventures at Sea: The Indian Ocean in World History (4)\n\nThis course examines the history of the interconnected region that scholars today call the Indian Ocean World.

The course focuses on the adventures of people who traversed long distances and shaped this world - merchants, soldiers, religious pilgrims, sailors, pirates, coolie laborers and sex workers. It considers the varieties of sources that can aid in constructing the history of the region, how forces of globalization and colonization affected its development, and how this region influenced the patterns of world history. Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 129 Jerusalem: Histories of the Real and Imagined Holy City (4)\n\nSacred to three religions, the contested future capital of two nations, a place of longing for millions, Jerusalem is one of the world's great cities. This course looks at the history, geography, and religious significance of the Holy City, while also considering its place as a city of the imagination. In investigating the city's place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its historic importance for Muslim and European imperialists, its long status as a tourist and pilgrimage destination, and its significance in Israeli and Palestinian nationalism, the course asks whether the myriad understandings of the city can co-exist or is Jerusalem destined to always be \"a golden bowl filled with scorpions.\". Open only to first-year students and sophomores.\n\nHIST 131 \"We are not what we seem\": Race, Class and Identity in American History since 1863 (4)\n\nThis course focuses on Race, Class, and Identity in American history since the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 to the present, emphasizing specific political, social, and economic developments.

Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the European Studies program.\n\nHIST 496 History and Religion in Medieval Europe (4)\n\nThis course covers the history of Europe during the Middle Ages, roughly 500-1500 A.D. It also introduces students to the rise of Christianity as a world religion within the Roman Empire, leading to its eventual domination in Western Europe, and to its interaction with medieval Judaism and emerging Islam. The course combines the study of religion with that of history, precisely because one of the features of the Middle Ages was the centrality of religion to politics, society, and culture. The study of primary sources, including, among others, the writings of Sidonius Apollinaris, Rabia of Basra, Bede, Einhard, Hildegard of Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Christine de Pisan and Petrarch, underpin the structure of the course. This course is only available through the European Studies Program. Prerequisite: Only open to students admitted to the European Studies program."
