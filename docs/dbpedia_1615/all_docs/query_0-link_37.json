Since the 1960s, critics have—at best—accused Black Power of distracting attention from more productive endeavors, betraying the promise of civil rights, and dividing an interracial coalition of sympathetic liberals. At worst, opponents have attacked Black Power as a foolish, racist, and violent threat to white America, the state, and the Black Freedom Struggle itself. Participants and scholars, however, tell a different story. Rather than divisive and destructive, the Black Power Movement was unifying and creative. Rather than betraying a winning civil rights coalition, Black Power exposed and challenged the limitations of white allies and liberal reform. Rather than a radical break with the past, Black Power represented a new articulation of old traditions of race pride and self-determination. Accordingly, this course favors a deep historical context.\n\nHY 274.

Much of this simple narrative reflects the lived experience of historical actors. Yet this class follows recent trends in academic scholarship by challenging the temporal, geographic, and ideological parameters of the classic civil rights movement. Over the course of ten weeks we will move chronologically through a longer narrative, one that begins sometime before Rosa Parks refused her seat on a Montgomery city bus in 1955 and ends sometime after passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

Case studies in different locations will illuminate major themes in the history of health and medicine including how different societies conceptualized health, classified symptoms and diseases, assured treatment using a range of therapeutics, and regulated healing practices and practitioners. We will critically analyze the causes and effects of changes in the practice of medicine over time, including the development of new modes of knowing the body and illness, from anatomy and germ theory, to DNA technology; shifts in the understanding of disease transmission and categories of disease and movement of these ideas between societies; and methods for responding to disease at communal or individual scales. This will include attention to changes in non-biomedical therapeutic systems, which were not stable over time. In the later part of the course, we will consider recent history, including the professionalization of health workers, the medicalization of childbirth and mental health. Over the course, we will reflect on repeating themes, including how states, polities, and communities sought to control epidemics, and the possibility of coercion in medicine. The class will reveal the consistency of global exchange in the development of medical and therapeutic practices, and the importance of knowledge from the Global South in producing scientific and biomedical information. Our class will include an explicit focus to the relationship between health, medicine and disease and colonialism, and highlight the ways in which medicine reflected and produced ideas of sexuality, sex, gender, and race, and ways in which health was often potent excuse for racism and xenophobia. Our class will emphasize the skills of historical analysis (especially consulting historical materials, a.k.a. primary source.\n\nHY 300.

In this class, we will pay particular attention to how cultural and social perceptions of “madness” changed as the contemporary prison replaced the lunatic asylum as the primary location for housing our society’s mentally ill. How have both the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness changed over the course of the twentieth century? How have these diagnoses and treatments been divided along axes of race, class, gender, and sexuality? How has “madness” been represented in popular culture? And finally, how have the mentally disabled themselves sought to intervene in discourses surrounding mental health and illness? These are among the questions we will be asking this semester.\n\nHY 351.

Politically, Scots and Irish people were absorbed (often violently) into the British state but fought to maintain their own political traditions and sense of sovereignty in movements such as the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the United Irishmen Movement, and eventually, the Irish independence movement. Economically, both nations began the period as predominantly agricultural economies before transitioning to diversified commercial economies, a transition that could lead to real human tragedy, as illustrated most dramatically by the Great Hunger of the 1860s. Students will learn about these societal changes and how they affected the lives and identity of ordinary Scots and Irish people. The course will end by discussing Irish and Scottish identity today and how recent upheavals such as the Good Friday Agreement, Brexit, and the rise of the Scottish National Party may influence Scotland, Ireland, and Northern Ireland’s future historical path.\n\nHY 361.

The Black Power Movement. 3 Hours.\n\nThe Black Power Movement remains one of the most compelling—and misunderstood—elements of African American History. Since the 1960s, critics have—at best—accused Black Power of distracting attention from more productive endeavors, betraying the promise of civil rights, and dividing an interracial coalition of sympathetic liberals. At worst, opponents have attacked Black Power as a foolish, racist, and violent threat to white America, the state, and the Black Freedom Struggle itself. Participants and scholars, however, tell a different story. Rather than divisive and destructive, the Black Power Movement was unifying and creative. Each session will combine collective discussion of the readings and group analysis of primary sources with an abbreviated lecture.\n\nHY 374.

The Long Civil Rights Movement. 3 Hours.\n\nThe civil rights movement survives in historical memory as a product of the 1950s and 1960s, when Black southerners rose up against Jim Crow and agitated for citizenship rights and basic dignity. Much of this simple narrative reflects the lived experience of historical actors. Yet this class follows recent trends in academic scholarship by challenging the temporal, geographic, and ideological parameters of the classic civil rights movement. Over the course of ten weeks we will move chronologically through a longer narrative, one that begins sometime before Rosa Parks refused her seat on a Montgomery city bus in 1955 and ends sometime after passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

Topics to be explored include the AIDS crisis, the war on drugs, fitness and diet culture, vaccination scares, breastfeeding, the obesity epidemic, and the opioid crisis.\n\nHY 385. History of Haiti. 3 Hours.\n\nThe dominant narrative of Haiti paints the country and people as poor, politically unstable, corrupt, violent, “Voodoo” worshippers, and plagued with zombies and “boat people” fleeing to the shores of Miami. In this course, we will examine the history of Haiti from slavery through the twentieth century and seek to gain a broader understanding of the country and to develop the tools to critically challenge these dominant narratives. We will consider the impact of colonialism, slavery, the Haitian Revolution, the ostracism of the first black republic in the nineteenth century, meanings of freedom, the Dominican Republic, relationship with foreign powers, immigration, U.S. intervention, and the Haitian diaspora among other topics.\n\nHY 386. Science, Technology, and Medicine in Africa. 3 Hours.\n\nThis undergraduate seminar will examine the social history of technology, science, and medicine in Africa from the 8th century to the present. Beginning in the pre-colonial period, our readings and discussions will highlight Africa as the site of centuries of innovation, for example, in hunting and ironworking. We will trace the movement of technologies, therapies, and ideas from Africa, focusing on African ways of knowing. Following on Clapperton Mavhunga, we will consider a wide range of tools and knowledge as technologies, tracing their production, movement, and use. Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to the relationship between technological development and gender, from masculinity in hunting, to contraceptives in The Gambia, to public transportation in Kenya. We will use specific examples discuss how Africa has been perceived to be without technology or the passive recipient of technology, as in the case of artisanal mining. In fact, the continent was the origin point for many products, like pharmaceuticals. We will debate the concept of Africa as a laboratory for the co-production of scientific knowledge and technologies between Africa, Europe, and the United States. And we will examine the technologies involved in global health research projects as charted in recent scholarship. Taking our lead from scholarship which moves between global and local frames, our discussions will move from the international to the local, and back again we will be attentive to how global economic and political networks structure the production and use of different technologies in Africa, including global capitalist networks. In all sessions, we will consider how technology reflects and produces social power, along the axes like gender, race, age, and occupational status group membership.\n\nHY 388.

Introduction to the History of Modern Medicine. 3 Hours.\n\nThis course will introduce students to themes in the history of medicine from 1600 to present, using a global frame and following changes in medical practice in many therapeutic systems. Case studies in different locations will illuminate major themes in the history of health and medicine including how different societies conceptualized health, classified symptoms and diseases, assured treatment using a range of therapeutics, and regulated healing practices and practitioners. We will critically analyze the causes and effects of changes in the practice of medicine over time, including the development of new modes of knowing the body and illness, from anatomy and germ theory, to DNA technology; shifts in the understanding of disease transmission and categories of disease and movement of these ideas between societies; and methods for responding to disease at communal or individual scales. This will include attention to changes in non-biomedical therapeutic systems, which were not stable over time. In the later part of the course, we will consider recent history, including the professionalization of health workers, the medicalization of childbirth and mental health. Over the course, we will reflect on repeating themes, including how states, polities, and communities sought to control epidemics, and the possibility of coercion in medicine. The class will reveal the consistency of global exchange in the development of medical and therapeutic practices, and the importance of knowledge from the Global South in producing scientific and biomedical information. Our class will include an explicit focus to the relationship between health, medicine and disease and colonialism, and highlight the ways in which medicine reflected and produced ideas of sexuality, sex, gender, and race, and ways in which health was often potent excuse for racism and xenophobia.\n\nHY 401.

Science, Technology, and Medicine in Africa. 3 Hours.\n\nThis undergraduate seminar will examine the social history of technology, science, and medicine in Africa from the 8th century to the present. Beginning in the pre-colonial period, our readings and discussions will highlight Africa as the site of centuries of innovation, for example, in hunting and ironworking. We will trace the movement of technologies, therapies, and ideas from Africa, focusing on African ways of knowing. Following on Clapperton Mavhunga, we will consider a wide range of tools and knowledge as technologies, tracing their production, movement, and use. Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to the relationship between technological development and gender, from masculinity in hunting, to contraceptives in The Gambia, to public transportation in Kenya. We will use specific examples discuss how Africa has been perceived to be without technology or the passive recipient of technology, as in the case of artisanal mining. In fact, the continent was the origin point for many products, like pharmaceuticals. We will debate the concept of Africa as a laboratory for the co-production of scientific knowledge and technologies between Africa, Europe, and the United States. And we will examine the technologies involved in global health research projects as charted in recent scholarship. Taking our lead from scholarship which moves between global and local frames, our discussions will move from the international to the local, and back again we will be attentive to how global economic and political networks structure the production and use of different technologies in Africa, including global capitalist networks. In all sessions, we will consider how technology reflects and produces social power, along the axes like gender, race, age, and occupational status group membership.\n\nHY 489.
