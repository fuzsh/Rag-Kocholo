        "text": "This article looks at the development of ‘Young Ladies’ Institutions’, a term often used by contemporaries for a select group of influential Scottish day schools for middle-class girls, mostly based in Edinburgh or Glasgow, which were in existence between 1833 and about 1870. The schools were established to counter the prevailing practice by middle-class pupils of moving between different teachers in different locations for different subjects, and arbitrarily selecting subjects to study in a ‘cafeteria’ mode. The characteristics of the YLIs were: 1) their large size, ranging from 64 or 80 pupils in 1836 to 170 or even over 300 in the 1840s and 1850s. 2) That they saw themselves as part of the public educational provision of urban education. The teachers and directors courted public attention and provided information about their pedagogy and facilities and provided access to the classes. 3) The schools were taught and managed by leading male teachers, either as propriety institutions or partnerships. Women provided support, generally as supervisory governesses, and more rarely as designated teachers of subjects such as dancing or music. The post of ‘lady superintendent’ was however extremely important, as the woman permanently on site, who managed the overall arrangements that had been laid down by the male directors. In 1834 the directors of the Scottish Institution for the Education of Young Ladies (Edinburgh) paid their lady superintendent a salary of 150 guineas. The directors encouraged pupils to follow a comprehensive and rounded curriculum by offering an all-in package of subjects for a slump fee, although they too, had to make single subjects available to gain sufficient pupils. Most of the schools offered various types of science, some of it taught innovatively and some also provided mathematics. Competitive learning was also a feature of the class teaching. By the 1860s the schools were losing their dynamism and could not compete with the creation of the huge endowed girls’ day schools, the first initiated by the Merchant Company of Edinburgh in 1871 with 1200 pupils on its roll. Nevertheless in the early nineteenth century the YLIs had an influence out of proportion to their numbers or size. Many of the teachers and directors emphasised the value of an intellectual education for girls, and some made more feminist statements. But the fact that the management and teaching of these prestigious schools was by men also gave out contradictory messages about the opportunities available for women and the relative status of female teachers. Furthermore the existence of the schools encouraged Scottish complacency about educational standards for girls into the twentieth century."
