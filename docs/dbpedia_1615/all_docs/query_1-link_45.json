        "text": "Scotland manager Steve Clarke wants \"tough selections to make\" in his squad for Euro 2024 after recalling 41-year-old goalkeeper Craig Gordon for this month's friendlies against the Netherlands and Northern Ireland.\n\nGordon, who won the last of his 74 caps in November 2022, has played three times - in the Scottish Cup - since a year out with a double leg break.\n\nHe joins Hearts team-mate Zander Clark, established first choice Angus Gunn and Liam Kelly in the squad, but only three keepers will go to the finals.\n\n\"That's the situation. It's going to be an interesting decision,\" said Clarke, who took in Gordon's performance and first clean sheet of the season in Hearts' 1-0 cup win over Greenock Morton on Monday.\n\n\"It gives us a chance to look at Craig up close. Three competitive games and, without being disrespectful to the opposition that Hearts have played in the cup already, probably not games where Craig was overworked. Nice to see back him on the pitch.\n\n\"The key thing is to make sure that come the start of May, I've got tough selections to make - everybody fit and available.\n\n\"I would imagine I'll look at a number of players over the two games but I don't want to be too distracted with thinking about giving people chances to play.\"\n\nClarke added that the \"core squad\" from Scotland's successful qualification campaign \"deserve the chance to go to the Euros\"."
