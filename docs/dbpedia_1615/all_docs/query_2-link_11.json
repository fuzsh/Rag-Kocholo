        "text": "The agony, the ignominy and the long road home. The team that said they were in Germany to make history retreated on Monday with a notoriety of an altogether different kind.\n\nScotlandâs performance was, indeed, the stuff of legend, in one sense. Their statistics belong in a hall of shame, or one of those odditoriums with magic mirrors and optical illusions.\n\nGenerations would stare in wonder at the numbers Scotland delivered here and question how on earth they could be so poor. Two goals (neither of them finished by a Scottish player) was bad enough, but three shots on target in three games is a lamentable figure.\n\nSeven individual players from other nations have had more shots on target than all of Scotlandâs players put together - and six of that seven have only played two games. Fifteen other players have already equalled Scotlandâs overall total.\n\nThey rank bottom in the shots on target table, bottom on the expected goals table (an inept 0.97), currently second from bottom on the xG conceded table (4.3) and joint bottom on the attempts on goal table. They will surely end up bottom of that list, too.\n\nIt is only in the saves and clearances and tackles categories where Scotland are top end. High marks for heart, no marks in many other senses.\n\nScotland came to the Euros and did not fire a shot, almost literally. Save for the spirit showed against Switzerland, the whole thing was a damp squib. They went out with a whimper.\n\nThere are myriad reasons for all of this, some major, some minor, some speculative. The truth is the demise of this team, from a point of five straight wins during March to September last year and the concession of just one goal - which happened to be an Erling Haaland penalty - has been steady and alarming.\n\nIt started long before they ever set foot in Germany. They came here on the back of one win in nine games - a dreary victory over Gibraltar.\n\nTheir defence became shaky, their goals dried up. Scott McTominay scored seven times from eight attempts on target in qualification, a freakish return that could not be sustained. Nobody else stepped up.\n\nChe Adams works hard but struggled to make an impact, although in fairness he was not blessed with service. Scotlandâs forwards plough a joyless furrow.\n\nSteve Clarkeâs go-to men became diminished. Was that tiredness? Was it the enormity of the occasion getting to them?\n\nThey talked from the very outset about being the team that finally got through a group stage at a major championship and then could not back up their talk with action. In two of the three games they carried virtually no threat.\n\nDid they out-psyche themselves? You would need a team of boffins to figure out the complex psychology of each player, but they were not themselves - nowhere near.\n\nJohn McGinn has not looked anything like the McGinn immortalised in song. Among Scotlandâs main men, he was far from alone in seeing the tournament pass him by.\n\nInjuries hit in giant and destructive waves and Scotland limped into the Euros.\n\nClarke tried to explain away the run of losses on the road to Germany as friendlies against the elite (no shame in losing against Europeâs heavy hitters), dead rubber group games and glorified training sessions. It will be all right on the night, he said.\n\nIt was not and anybody watching the deterioration of this team with dispassionate eyes (not easy given the incredible emotion involved) might have predicted it.\n\nClarke railed against the Argentine referee who refused to give Scotland a penalty they probably deserved on Sunday night - but his comments were crass, to put it mildly. Heat of the moment stuff, for sure, but those words he used were like much of what Scotland did in Germany - misguided.\n\nWhat was more pertinent was the complete absence of aggression and intensity in most of Scotlandâs performance. What backfired was Clarkeâs own rigid belief that picking the same players in the same positions was going to produce a different outcome to the ones seen for nine or 10 months now.\n\nIt is a Clarke mantra that he believes in his players - or a core group of players, although plenty did not see any game time. He, possibly, believes too much.\n\nHe was not blessed with options, but he had James Forrest and Lawrence Shankland playing noâpart and a bit-part, he had substitutions he could have made to shake things up and he either did not make them or made them too late in the day.\n\nHis team was passive, flat, unthreatening. They went out meekly and thereâs now an understandable focus on Clarke and his team selection, team formation and in-game problem solving. 'In Clarke We Trust' is a phrase that did the rounds a while back, but no longer.\n\nHe has been magnificent in guiding Scotland to back-to-back European Championships and has the unwavering support of everybody at the Scottish FA.\n\nIf he wants to carry on then he will. However, he has to find ways of making this team play with more fire and ambition.\n\nHad Scotland gone out in a blaze of action and ambition then the fans would have taken it on the chin. There was none of that.\n\nThe re-introduction of Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey will make a difference. Lewis Fergusonâs time is surely coming, just as soon as he has recovered from the injury that ended what was a brilliant Serie A campaign with Bologna.\n\nScotland need the width and pace of Ben Doak. They need to see if Tommy Conway has it. If Clarke is to stay then he needs to adapt - and now.\n\nHe has Poland, Portugal and Croatia as Nations League rivals. The fatalists would say Scotland will be one win in 18 when those games conclude.\n\nPessimistic, no doubt, but thatâs not an outlandish forecast. There are tough days ahead for Clarke.\n\nFans will be less forgiving after this Euros failure compared to the last. One point then and one point now. Whereâs the progress? What lessons are being learned?\n\nSome will be convinced his time should be up, that he has taken this team as far as he can.\n\nScotland finished where their world ranking suggested they would but it was the manner of it that was the problem, the non-performance in two games out of three, the lack of goal threat and the sight of a brilliant opportunity passing them by.\n\nWe probably will not hear from Clarke for a little while but it will be interesting to listen to him when he resurfaces.\n\nHas he got the ideas and the energy to drive on through the doubt that now faces him? What does he think went wrong and how does he intend to put it right?\n\nSurely the penny has dropped now that more of the same is not good enough."
