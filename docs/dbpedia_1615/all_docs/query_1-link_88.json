        "text": "My first encounter with a Scottish bothy came in my mid-teens. I was wholly uninterested in anything outdoorsy throughout my school years, but for some reason, I gladly put my name in the hat to be drawn as one of the chosen few, ready to embark on a school bothy adventure up north. Perhaps it was intrigue, excitement at the prospect of an exclusive opportunity, or just plain old ‘fomo’ that encouraged me to step outside my comfort zone. Either way, it’s a memory that’s stuck with me all these years. The creepy old attic bed, straw bursting out the mattress. The dark rooms where we cooked and slept, top to tail on the stone floor. The river flowing outside where we washed our dishes. And that stash of Sweetheart Stout and men’s magazines that no doubt made our teachers blush. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced before or, until very recently, since.\n\nFor decades bothy locations were kept hush hush, accessible only to those in the know. Directions were passed on by word of mouth and ‘bothying’ a hobby enjoyed by relatively few. The remoteness and anonymity associated with bothies meant that it never even occurred to me in adulthood to seek one out. Indeed, I wouldn’t even have known how, the location of my inaugural bothy a complete mystery to me.\n\nBut the times they are a changing. In 2009 the MBA (Mountain Bothy Association) publicly published the grid references of all their bothies. And in 2017 Geoff Allan’s The Scottish Bothy Bible helped make even the most far flung Scottish bothy seem within reach to those with an adventurous streak.\n\nNo two bothies are the same, however there are some common features you can expect. Facilities are very basic, with no electricity, running water, heating or toilets.\n\nMost bothies have a fireplace for burning coal or wood. Some estates provide fire wood, however it’s best to carry in all fuel supplies yourself. Bothies usually have a table and a few chairs, and often a wooden sleeping platform. Otherwise, expect to sleep on the wooden or stone floor. There’s usually a natural water source nearby, a stream or such like. A spade is provided for digging a toilet hole – get used to going au naturale!\n\nMost bothies have a dustpan and brush for sweeping up, a bucket for ash cleaned out of the fireplace and an area for storing firewood and supplies. Be sure to clean up before you go, and try to leave dry kindling and any other useful supplies for the next visitor. Don’t leave perishable food as this can attract mice.\n\nTake ALL your rubbish with you when you go. This includes bottles and burnt-out tealight candles. Think about this when planning your supplies – those empty glass bottles and jars will take up weight and space in your backpack on the return journey too! If you find rubbish when you arrive, help by carrying it out with you.\n\nOf course, at the most popular bothies and busiest times of year, there physically may not be room for one more, so always be prepared to camp outside if need be. To avoid overcrowding and straining what are already very limited facilities, you shouldn’t go to a bothy in large groups (6 or more). Nor should you stay more than a couple of nights. Remember to record your visit in the Bothy Book, which also makes for great fireside reading.\n\nI’ve also found the Maps.Me app (iOS/Android) to be really helpful for route planning and navigation. Zoom in on the area you’re looking for and download the region map when prompted. You can now view this map offline too, great for when your data connection inevitably disappears!\n\nTap the search icon (the magnifying glass at the bottom left) and type ‘wilderness hut’ to bring up a general list, or the specific name of the bothy you’re looking for. Select ‘View on map’ to see the location of many of Scotland’s bothies, represented by a blue dot. Zoom in for detail, often including the actual hiking trail to reach the bothy. Select your departure point and mark ‘Route from’, and your arrival point and mark ‘Route to’. Tap the walking icon at the top and the app will show you the route, distance and approx walking time. A directional arrow keeps you on track when on the trail. Unfortunately it doesn’t give any indication of the terrain, which is where a good old fashioned OS map comes in handy (or a quick check of Google Maps (iOS/Android) terrain view)."
