Up to the time of its publication there was no annotated bibliography of the principal works in these interconnected fields, and the historical importance of mesmerism and its offshoots was largely unrecognized. Since 1988 the awareness of the significance of these works for the history of psychiatry, psychology, psychical research, and hypnotism has greatly increased. This bibliography's extreme scarcity in the book market makes this online version an extremely valuable resource for anyone interested in these fields.\n\nâAdam Crabtree\n\nHistorical Introduction\n\nAnimal magnetism is little known today. Most historical scholars would probably be hard pressed to write more than a brief paragraph about Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815) and his discovery. Yet, for approximately seventy-five years from its beginnings in 1779, animal magnetism flourished as a medical and psychological specialty, and for another fifty years it continued to be a system of some influence.\n\nWhen one examines the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, it seems incredible that this once powerful system is now almost completely forgotten. That animal magnetism is no longer practiced is hardly surprising. The theory of animal magnetism in its original form would be difficult for most moderns to accept. What is puzzling is that the story of animal magnetism is so neglected.\n\nAnimal magnetism is not comparable to certain medical fads which flourished for a time and then died out. Such crazes did not significantly shape medical or psychological theory and practice, nor did they significantly affect the evolution of those disciplines. Animal magnetism, on the other hand, had a profound impact on medicine, psychology, and psychical research (today called parapsychology), as a brief examination of its history will show.\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer and Animal Magnetism\n\nThe seeds of thought that gave birth to animal magnetism may be found in Mesmer’s thesis Dissertatio physico-medica de planetarum influxu of 1766, which he wrote for a doctorate in medicine at the University of Vienna. In this treatise Mesmer developed the notion of “animal gravitation,” a force which he considered to be both the cause of universal gravitation and the foundation for all bodily properties, and which he believed to affect organisms in the most intimate way. Mesmer believed that animal gravitation connected living things to the stars and was the basis for healthy functioning, since it harmonized the body in a fashion comparable to the tuning of a musical instrument.\n\nMesmer’s interest in invisible forces found concrete expression in his early medical practice, where he experimented with using iron magnets to treat illness. Spurred on by success, Mesmer enthusiastically turned his attention to revising his theory of “animal gravitation.” Retaining his central idea of a universal force that is the foundation for health and disease, he renamed that force “animal magnetism,” finding it to possess many of the characteristics associated with mineral magnetism. The more Mesmer experimented, the more he became disenchanted with using iron magnets to heal. He came to believe that the physician himself is a magnet of a very special kind, capable of channeling the invisible “magnetic fluid” that pervades the universe into the body of the sick person and bringing about the magnetic balance necessary for a cure.\n\nThe basic principles of Mesmer’s theory of animal magnetism were articulated in twenty-seven propositions in his Mémoire sur la découverte du magnétisme animal of 1779. Among the more informative are the following:\n\n1) There exists a mutual influence between the celestial bodies, the earth and animate bodies; 2) The means of this influence is a fluid that is universally distributed and continuous . . . and which, by its nature, is capable of receiving, propagating and communicating all impressions of movement; 3) This reciprocal action is governed by mechanical laws as yet unknown. . . .; . . . 8) The animal body experiences the alternative effects of this agent which insinuates them into the nerves and affects them immediately; 9) It particularly manifests itself in the human body by properties analogous to the magnet. . . .; 10) Because the property of the animal body which makes it susceptible to the influence of heavenly bodies and to the reciprocal action of those around it is analogous to that of the magnet, I decided to call it “animal magnetism.” . . .; . . . 23) The facts will show, following the practical rules that I will establish, that this principle can heal disorders of the nerves immediately, and other disorders mediately.\n\nMesmer eventually discontinued the use of iron magnets entirely, relying instead on the application of newly evolved animal-magnetic techniques. These techniques involved “magnetic passes” or sweeping movements of the hands to direct magnetic fluid to diseased parts of the patient’s body. Using these methods, Mesmer performed some remarkable, if controversial, cures in Austria and Germany and attempted to gain acceptance for his theory of animal magnetism from the medical establishment of Vienna. He was not successful in this endeavor and in 1778 decided to go to Paris, where, he believed, new ideas were more favorably considered.\n\nIn Paris, Mesmer set up two treatment clinics, one for the rich and the other for the poor. The sick flocked to him and he treated them by the hundreds over the next few years. During that time there were many among both rich and poor who testified to being cured by animal magnetism, in some cases of long-term chronic illnesses.\n\nDuring this period, Mesmer made attempts to get the medical establishment of Paris to approve his theory of animal magnetism, but try as he might, he could not gain a sympathetic hearing. On the contrary, the medical faculty at Paris became alarmed at the popularity of Mesmer’s clinics and moved to suppress them. In 1784 two commissions were constituted to investigate animal magnetism, both appointed by the king of France. One was made up of members of the Royal Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine; it included some of the country’s most eminent scientists and functioned under the chairmanship of Benjamin Franklin (1700–1790), then the American ambassador to France. The second commission was composed of physicians of the Royal Society of Medicine. The resulting investigations were carried out in the face of Mesmer’s objections and without his cooperation. Both commissions filed reports unfavorable to animal magnetism, although a member of the second commission wrote a dissenting opinion recommending further investigation. The first commission also drew up a secret report for the king on potential dangers to morals through the misuse of magnetic techniques.\n\nThe publication of the reports in 1784 was followed by a flood of treatises in response, many written by physicians. Some supported the conclusions of the commissions; others were strongly critical. In the latter category were the protests of dozens of medical practitioners who had themselves been using animal magnetism, in their opinion very successfully. They criticized the commissioners for both their attitude and the technique of investigation.\n\nMeanwhile Mesmer had become embroiled in a controversy about how his theory and technique were to be taught. Mesmer desired to secure his financial condition by charging a fee to those who wanted to be trained in animal magnetism. A scheme was worked out on Mesmer’s behalf by a banker, Guillaume Kornmann (b. ca. 1740) and a lawyer and freethinker, Nicholas Bergasse (1750–1832). It involved the founding of Societies of Harmony—which were to be considered the official organs for teaching animal magnetism, membership in the Society being gained through the subscription of a considerable sum of money. From the parent Society of Harmony in Paris, dozens more were established throughout France. Mesmer and Bergasse, who had become the chief spokesman of the Society of Harmony in Paris, eventually had a falling out and a split resulted.\n\nMesmer grew more and more disillusioned with Paris and undertook a series of trips away from that city. Eventually, he settled in Germany and lived in comparative seclusion. Although he continued periodically to write on animal magnetism after 1790, he was not very actively involved in its affairs. In 1812, the Berlin Academy of Science, surprised to discover that Mesmer was still alive, sent Karl Christian Wolfart (1778–1832) to find out about animal magnetism directly from its discoverer. Wolfart remained with Mesmer for two years, putting together what would be the master’s last treatise on animal magnetism. It was published under the title Mesmerismus. Oder System der Wechselwirkungen in 1814. Mesmer died in 1815.\n\nMagnetic Sleep\n\nAlthough Mesmer’s personal fortunes and fame waned after 1790, animal magnetism (also called “mesmerism”) flourished. This was due in no small part to the work of the Marquis de Puységur (1751–1825), one of Mesmer’s most loyal and enthusiastic pupils. Puységur discovered that some individuals fell into a kind of trance when animal magnetism was applied to them. Although appearing to be asleep, they were still conscious and could reply to questions and convey information. In this state of “magnetic sleep,” as Puységur called it, the patient was very suggestible, taking for reality any fantasy the magnetizer might depict. Upon awakening from magnetic sleep, the patient would remember nothing that had taken place while asleep.\n\nPuységur was fascinated by this unusual state of consciousness, so different from ordinary waking consciousness. He discovered that many in this state could apparently diagnose their own illnesses and those of others, and even prescribe effective remedies for the conditions they perceived. He also noticed that although magnetized subjects had no memory in the waking state for occurrences in the state of magnetic sleep, they did retain a continuous memory from sleep state to sleep state. Noting these two separate chains of memory that accompanied the two distinct states of consciousness, Puységur came to view magnetic sleep and the waking state as “two different existences.” From this seed, the notion of a seemingly separate mind or self operating covertly within the human psyche took root. It came to fruition some one hundred years later with the work of Pierre Janet and his concept of the “subconscious,” as described below.\n\nPuységur noted the similarity between “magnetic sleep” and the natural phenomenon of “sleepwalking” or “somnambulism,” the only difference between the two states being that in magnetic sleep the subject is in a special connection or “rapport” with the magnetizer, whereas in sleepwalking the sleeper is in rapport with no one. Because of the similarity, Puységur called the newly discovered state “magnetic somnambulism.” Another term that eventually came into use was “artificial somnambulism.”\n\nHypnotism\n\nPuységur’s work had a powerful influence on the practitioners of animal magnetism. Mesmer, working from a markedly mechanistic model of the human organism, had emphasized the physical action involved in magnetic healing. Puységur’s orientation was much more psychological. From his experiments with magnetic sleep, he developed the rudiments of a psychotherapy based upon the investigation of somnambulistic consciousness. He evolved a theory of mental disturbance as a state of “disorderly somnambulism” in which the individual moves in and out of a condition of disturbed somnambulism in a chaotic manner. Puységur’s psychological orientation is also demonstrated by the importance he placed on the role of human will when magnetizing and the need for the magnetizer to exercise “good will” in order to be effective. Although Puységur’s views differed in these significant ways from those of Mesmer, he nevertheless retained Mesmer’s notion of a “magnetic fluid” that passes between magnetizer and patient.\n\nPuységur became a very influential figure in the history of animal magnetism. His psychological concerns were taken up by many investigators and this eventually led to a new formulation of the theory of animal-magnetic phenomena. That formulation was first hinted at in the writings of the Abbé Faria (1755–1819) and Alexandre Bertrand (1795–1831) and reached its culmination in the work of the Manchester physician James Braid (1795–1860). In 1842 Braid coined the term “hypnotism” or “nervous sleep” to replace “animal magnetism,” intending to do away with any notion of a physical agent such as “magnetic fluid” that passes between magnetizer and subject and produces the phenomena of somnambulism. Braid described hypnotism as a psycho-physiological state that needs no operator and can be self-induced. He also emphasized the role of suggestion both in producing the hypnotic state and in bringing about the healing effects associated with it.\n\nEventually Braid’s view became the dominant one and his terminology the accepted nomenclature. This took some time, however, and animal magnetism in its traditional form remained a force to be reckoned with for another sixty years.\n\nThree Streams Flowing from Animal Magnetism\n\nIt is possible to trace three distinct currents of thought flowing directly from the discovery of animal magnetism. These three streams may be identified as 1) psychological, 2) medical, and 3) parapsychological.\n\nPsychological Stream\n\nThe most important of these three currents, from an historical point of view, is the psychological stream. Justly it can be said that Mesmer’s discovery of animal magnetism was a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern psychology and psychotherapy. It led to Puységur’s investigation of the consciousness manifested in magnetic sleep and the eventual discovery of a subconscious realm of mental activity. It also led to Braid’s teaching about hypnotism as a psychological phenomenon and the resulting exploration of the psychotherapeutic power of suggestion.\n\nThe magnetic tradition of Puységur and the hypnotic tradition of Braid were both very much in evidence in mid-nineteenth-century France, particularly in experimentation with somnambulism and its effects. Braid’s writings were “discovered” in France around 1860, and by the 1870s and 1880s, men trained in psychological observation, such as Charles Richet (1850–1935), Henri Beaunis (1830–1921), and Joseph Delboeuf (1831–1896), began to become involved in work on hypnotic phenomena.\n\nIn the 1860s, Ambroise Liébeault (1823–1901), a provincial physician, had undertaken some special observations of his own. He used hypnotism to treat the illnesses of some of his clients with great success. Liébeault believed that hypnotism was based on suggestion and that its healing effects were due to the power of suggestion. Hippolyte Bernheim (1840–1919), professor of medicine at Nancy, was impressed by Liébeault’s results, and the two initiated what came to be called the Nancy school of hypnotism.\n\nMeanwhile, the highly respected neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) was developing his own ideas about the nature of hypnotism based on his work with hysterical patients at the Salpêtrière Hospital. Because Charcot worked from a more physicalist model of hypnotism, his ideas came into conflict with those of Liébeault and Bernheim. The resulting competition between the Nancy school and the school of the Salpêtrière continued for many years, resulting in extremely valuable experimental studies of hypnotism, suggestion, and hysteria.\n\nAmong the associates of Charcot, although not an adherent of his school, was Pierre Janet (1859–1947). Janet had a particular interest in hysteria and the automatisms associated with that condition. From his observations, he developed the notion of the “subconscious,” a realm of mental activity in which emotional disorders originate. His ground-breaking work in this area made possible the development of all modern psychotherapies that accept the reality of an unconscious realm of mental and emotional activity influencing ordinary human life. Janet’s discoveries had a strong impact on the subsequent work of Max Dessoir (1867–1947), Morton Prince (1854–1929), Boris Sidis (1867–1923), and William James (1842–1910), among others.\n\nMultiple personality was one of the disorders that was most closely studied by Janet and others who were interested in fathoming the mechanism of the subconscious. It was considered to be a special form of hysteria in which somnambulistic consciousness had taken the form of well-defined, distinct personalities. Janet, Alfred Binet (1857–1911), Eugène Azam (1822–1899), and others pioneered work in this area and used their findings to throw light not only on hysterical disorders but also on the nature of hypnotic consciousness in the normal individual.\n\nThese insights into the subconscious carried implications for possible treatment methods for the emotionally disturbed. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) was influenced by these developments, and his earlier works clearly reflect the magnetic-hypnotic tradition with its gradual unveiling of an unconscious mental life.\n\nMedical Stream\n\nIn its origins, animal magnetism was a healing system. It was based on a view of the human organism as a self-healing entity requiring the proper balance of a universal “magnetic fluid” that affects the ebb and flow of the life force. The techniques of animal magnetism were geared to restoring that balance in persons suffering from illness.\n\nAlthough Puységur’s work diverted the attention of many magnetizers to psychological pursuits, there remained a powerful current of interest in the healing work Mesmer originally envisioned. In the literature it is not always easy to differentiate between those interested in the investigation of somnambulistic consciousness and those interested in magnetic healing, since more often than not practitioners were involved with both. However, the two concerns were distinguishable in practice. This is reflected by the fact that many of the thousands of books written on animal magnetism before 1925 have one section dealing with the treatment of disease and another dealing with somnambulistic phenomena.\n\nPuységur himself had pointed out that many individuals, when put into a state of magnetic sleep, would spontaneously diagnose their own illnesses and those of others. He also described instances in which the somnambulist prescribed treatment by specific medicines or medical procedures. He considered this to be one of the great benefits of magnetic sleep, claiming that somnambulists were almost always correct in their diagnosis and that their prescribed treatments were often successful.\n\nIn 1826 there appeared a hefty treatise of nearly twelve hundred pages compiled by Simon Mialle (b. ca. 1790) entitled Exposé par ordre alphabétique des cures opérés en France par le magnétisme animal. This work gives some idea of the vast extent of the tradition of magnetic healing in the decades following Mesmer. Here Mialle details cases of cure through the application of animal magnetism between 1774 and 1826. In each case there is a description of the disease treated, the animal-magnetic procedure employed, and the results produced. Each instance is documented by source, and the reader cannot help but be impressed by the sheer volume of work of this kind being done in those early years.\n\nThe healing tradition of animal magnetism continued well beyond the year 1826, extending even into the twentieth century. After 1880, books on animal-magnetic healing often incorporated chapters on healing by suggestion, taking a page from the successful medical use of hypnotism by Liébeault and his followers.\n\nBesides healing, another medical use of animal magnetism was as an anesthetic for surgery. The first well-documented surgical operation on an individual in a state of magnetic somnambulism was performed in Paris on April 16, 1829. The mesmerist was Pierre Jean Chapelain and the surgeon was Jules Cloquet (1790–1883), later famous for his works on anatomy. The surgery was for the removal of a cancerous breast from a sixty-four-year-old woman, a Madame Plantin. The earliest use of animal magnetism as an anesthetic in the United States seems to have been a painless tooth extraction performed by the mesmerist Bugard in 1836. It seems that this new use of animal magnetism did not really come into its own until the early 1840s. In 1842 a Dr. Ward successfully performed the amputation of a leg at the thigh upon a mesmerized patient in London. His influential colleague, John Elliotson (1791–1868), immediately took up the cause for this medical use of animal magnetism, and in India James Esdaile (1808–1859), carried out dozens of serious operations on magnetized patients in the mid-1840s. At about the same time a series of surgical operations were performed under Dr. Loisel in Cherbourg, France.\n\nAll this promising activity involving animal magnetism as an anesthetic soon faded, however, with the introduction in Britain of ether as an analgesic in 1847. Although animal magnetism or hypnotism did not become widely used as an anesthetic, some surgical operations under its agency continued to be performed long after chemicals were well established in that role. In fact, the rise of interest in hypnotism in France around 1860 was strongly associated with its successful use in surgery.\n\nParapsychological Stream: Psychical Research\n\nPsychical research, the scientific study of the paranormal, may be said to have had its official beginning in 1882 with the establishment of the Society for Psychical Research in Britain. Psychical research was the direct result of certain developments arising from animal magnetism. These were: 1) the occult medico-philosophical tradition in Germany that adopted animal-magnetic theory; 2) the development of “magnetic magic” in France; and 3) the rise of spiritualism in the United States.\n\nIn Germany animal magnetism developed a strong early following among those influenced by romantic philosophy, so prominent at the end of the eighteenth century. Literary men such as Jean Paul Richter (1763–1825) and E.T.A. Hoffman (1776–1822), physicians including Johannes Kaspar Lavater (1741–1801) and Friederich Hufeland (1774–1839), and religious philosopher Johannes Heinrich Jung-Stilling (1740–1817) are examples of thinkers who found the notion of a universal magnetic agent that connected all beings and was the source of life and health a most congenial concept. The spiritual philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) had made inroads of its own in late eighteenth-century Germany; magnetic somnambulists began to have Swedenborgian style visions, communicating with the world of spirits in mesmeric ecstasy. Paranormal-type phenomena, such as clairvoyance and precognition, were common in these circles, astounding the curious observer. While there were many who were content to account for these marvels through a romantic, occult-oriented philosophy, some felt the need for a more scientific approach that could examine the facts systematically and evaluate their credibility, a need that would not be met until the rise of psychical research in the latter part of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe French developed their own particular melding of animal magnetism and occult tradition. The most influential magnetizer of this kind was the Baron Du Potet De Sennevoy (1796–1881). He developed a system called “magnetic magic” that revised animal magnetism’s traditional doctrine of a universal magnetic fluid by incorporating it within the older notion of a universal spiritual power, which serves as the basis for “natural magic.” This concept, so different from the mechanical view of Mesmer’s, considered magnetism to be the bond between spirit and matter, or body and soul. In Du Potet’s view, mesmerizers who recognized the true nature of magnetism could work “magic,” producing marvelous cures and various paranormal phenomena.\n\nAnimal magnetism began making significant inroads in the United States from the mid-1830s on. Lectures by Charles Poyen St. Sauveur (d. 1844) on animal magnetism excited the imagination of the country and led to the emergence of magnetic practitioners of a peculiarly American type. Itinerant magnetizers wandered the countryside with professional somnambulists at their sides, stopping in the local towns to give medical clairvoyant readings. For a fee, the somnambulist would diagnose an illness and prescribe remedies. The visionary Andrew Jackson Davis (1826–1910) began his career as such an itinerant somnambulist and eventually became an author of great popularity, using the magnetic trance to dictate his spiritual treatises. All this magnetic activity prepared the way for the rise of Spiritualism, initiated by “spirit rapping” in the home of John Fox in 1848. This spirit activity centered on the daughters of the household, and news of the purportedly paranormal activity of the Fox sisters spread rapidly throughout the United States, reaching England, France, and Germany within a few years. Spiritualist “mediums” appeared who claimed to be able to communicate with the departed on the “other side.” Typically, the medium would go into a self-induced trance and produce paranormal phenomena of the mental or psychic type (clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, etc.) or the physical type (levitation of objects, materialization of forms, production of mysterious lights, etc.).\n\nWhen Spiritualism spread to England in the early 1850s, it found a very receptive home. Within a few years spiritualistic mediums could be found in great abundance throughout the country. Spiritualist churches were established; spiritualist alliances were formed; and spiritualist books and newspapers came into print. There was such a proliferation of apparently paranormal spiritualistic phenomena that serious-minded people voiced the need for a careful scientific investigation to discover whether these things were real or illusory.\n\nThe successful spread of Spiritualism was to a large extent due to the popularity of a fad that grew out of spiritualistic circles and emigrated to Great Britain and Europe in 1853. This was the practice of “table tipping,” “table turning,” or “table tapping,” as it was commonly called. A group of people would gather around the parlour table, rest their hands in a circle on its surface, and wait for spontaneous movement to occur. Sometimes the table would rotate; at other times it would rise and fall on one side, tapping a leg on the floor. The tapping would be read as an alphabetical code, and a message would be deciphered. Many explained the phenomenon in terms of the action of spirits of the dead communicating with the living; others attributed the movements and messages to the action of animal magnetic fluid emanating from the participants; still others believed the participants were simply deluding themselves, the movement being produced by their own unconscious physical exertions.\n\nIn Germany, France, England, and the United States, the association between magnetic somnambulism and paranormal phenomena of the spiritualistic type was very strong. Many of the books and articles that appeared wove their way back and forth between the two areas, giving the impression that it was impossible to discuss one without dealing with the other. It is not surprising, then, that when the Society for Psychical Research was formed in England in 1882, it undertook to investigate not only the validity of spiritualistic phenomena, but also the nature of animal magnetism and hypnotism.\n\nIn the thirty years preceding the foundation of the Society for Psychical Research, there had been a number of notable attempts to investigate the phenomena of Spiritualism scientifically. Some were carried out by scientists, others by individuals untrained in the procedures of systematic investigation. The results were uneven and inconclusive. So when a group of academics, most of them associated with Cambridge, decided to set up a society that would undertake a study employing stringent scientific criteria, there was enthusiasm for the idea both from intellectuals and the Spiritualists themselves. The Society was fortunate to have the nearly full-time involvement of a number of highly gifted investigators and within a few years began publishing its Proceedings and a journal. This activity generated a great many similar studies of the paranormal by some of the brightest minds of the day. The result was the publication of a mass of material on psychical research that continued well into the twentieth century.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe three streams flowing from the discovery of animal magnetism often merged. Writers in the psychological stream such as William James and Charles Richet sometimes dealt with issues of psychical research. On the other hand, the literature of psychical research was rich in psychological writings of real significance. An example of this is F. W. H. Myers’s (1843–1901) classical work, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903), which is generally considered to be a significant contribution to the investigation of the subconscious.\n\nThe crossover among the three streams is also illustrated by the fact that both those interested in the psychological stream and those drawn to psychical research often investigated the healing and medical aspect of animal magnetism. Among the former, for example, were Hippolyte Bernheim, Jean-Martin Charcot, and Pierre Janet, who explored the relationship between the healing effects of animal magnetism and psychological factors, such as suggestion; among the latter were the members of the Society for Psychical Research whose studies focused on the nature of magnetic healing.\n\nThe histories of animal magnetism, hypnotism, and psychical research are inextricably intertwined. As will be evident from the annotated entries in the bibliography, the literature of any one of these areas cannot but include the literature of the other two.\n\nFormat of the Bibliography\n\nThis bibliography is intended to include the literature of animal magnetism and those streams of thought that can be identified as flowing directly from it. Conceived in the broadest possible terms, that literature is vast, far exceeding the scope of this work.\n\nThis bibliography has been consciously circumscribed for two reasons. The first is the desire to include only those works that are immediately connected with animal magnetism and the themes that arise directly from it. The second is the intention to produce a work focused on the most significant writings within the historical tradition arising from animal magnetism.\n\nThe effect of including only those works that are closely connected with the themes arising from animal magnetism is most easily illustrated by describing the categories of literature that have not been included. Omitted are works that deal exclusively with occultism, possession, or witchcraft; theosophy, anthroposophy, Christian Science, or other spiritual philosophies; theology or religious thought; and conjuring or stage magic. While spiritualist writings have true importance for the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, only those works have been included here that depict its development from mesmeric influences or that play a significant role in the rise of psychical research. This means that the bibliography does not include stories about clairvoyants, seers, or prophets; books relating communications from spirits; spiritualistic speculations about the afterlife or related matters; and collections of ghost-lore.\n\nThe second reason for circumscribing the bibliography, the wish to focus on the most significant writings arising within the animal magnetic tradition, necessitated the omission of works which, while legitimately part of the history of animal magnetism and its offshoots, are relatively minor. While it is difficult to define the criteria by which such a selection was made, a few words can be said about the thinking that was involved. Rating low on the list of works to be included were writings that simply summarize the work of others, collections of cases that have been dealt with in previous works, and popularizations intended to simplify and condense more serious treatises. In the field of hypnotism, this tended to exclude books on stage hypnotism, handbooks of hypnotic practice, pamphlets meant for home study of hypnotism, treatises on personal magnetism, and writings on auto-hypnosis and auto-suggestion. There are, of course, some works in these categories that were influential or otherwise significant, and they have been incorporated as appropriate into the bibliography.\n\nTime Frame\n\nThe bibliography begins with the year 1766, the date of publication of Mesmer’s medical thesis Dissertano physico-medica de planetarum influxu, which contains the first seeds of animal magnetism. The bibliography ends with the year 1925. This date was chosen for a number of reasons. First, by 1925 publication of works on animal magnetism had almost completely ceased. Second, shortly after 1925 the study of hypnotism entered a new phase, in which researchers such as Clark Hull, M. M. White, and others adopted innovative laboratory and statistical methods to explore its nature and effects. Third, by 1925 most of the classical works of psychical research had been published, and psychical research too was about to enter a new stage of development. Like that of hypnotism, this new stage, initiated by the work of Joseph Banks Rhine at Duke University in the late 1920s, involved the introduction of laboratory and statistical methods into the study of paranormal phenomena. Indeed, what had been “psychical research” became popularly referred to as “parapsychology.”\n\nAnnotations\n\nAnnotations are intended to provide information about the content of the work and thereby indicate its place in the history of the field. The length of the annotation depends to some extent upon the significance of the entry in that history. In some cases, due to inaccessibility of a given work, annotations were compiled without benefit of direct inspection.\n\nAnnotations are given for approximately one-third of the entries. The intention is to provide annotations for the most important items and a sufficient variety of less significant works to convey to the reader a sense of the evolution of the literature.\n\nForm of the Entries\n\nEntries are listed by year, from 1766 to 1925. Within each year, works are listed alphabetically. Each entry contains full bibliographic information, including author, title and publication data. Many entries contain annotations.\n\nPublication information is given in English: cities are cited in their commonly accepted English form (e.g., “Munich” rather than “München,” and “Rome” rather than “Roma”); multiple publishers are joined by English conjunctives (e.g., “Bailliére and Dentu” rather than “Bailliére et Dentu”); and “The Author” is used instead of “chez l’Auteur.”\n\nIncluded with every item is the designation [H] or [P], and in some instances [H & P.] These initials stand for Hypnotism, Psychical Research, and both.\n\nEvery effort has been made to provide information about the first edition of each book. In the few cases in which that could not be obtained, information about a later edition is given. For books in languages other than English, English translations known to exist are listed. It is intended ordinarily to give the earliest English translation.\n\nFinally, undated works have been assigned the most accurate date that can be ascertained. In some cases, because of inaccessibility of the works, entries lack information about publisher or pages.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to acknowledge a number of people who helped make books available for my research.
