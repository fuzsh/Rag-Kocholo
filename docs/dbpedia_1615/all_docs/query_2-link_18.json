Just be sure to keep your muck boots handy, because the learning here is always hands-on and knee-deep.\n\nWhether it's practicing Spanish on a galleon, excavating shipwrecks, or finding your way around The Alligator Farm, the only thing you won't find here are typical, dull lectures. (And yes, we literally mean a farm with real alligators.)\n\nThis college is for people who want to go where others haven't and do what has yet to be done.\n\nWe asked professors and staff to recommend a robust group of graduating seniors from the Class of 2023 who boldly embody what it means to be a Saint.\n\nExplore the stories of these featured graduates, the wisdom theyâ€™ve collected, and the caliber of excellence they achieved at Flagler College.\n\nRead More"
