        "text": "The Convener\n\nAgenda item 2 is an oral evidence session on the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill at stage 1. I welcome Dr Andy Hayward, associate professor in family law at Durham Law School; Dr Kelly Kollman, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Glasgow; Professor Kenneth Norrie, professor of law at the University of Strathclyde; and Martin Loat, chair of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign.\n\nMorag Driscoll, convener of the child and family law committee of the Law Society of Scotland, will join us shortly. We have received apologies from Professor Elaine Sutherland, who is unfortunately unwell.\n\nI ask the witnesses to spend a couple of minutes telling the committee about their knowledge and interest in civil partnerships, and also to tell us whether they support the principles of the bill.\n\nDr Kelly Kollman (University of Glasgow)\n\nI am a political scientist, and I have studied same-sex unions for a number of years, largely in Europe and North America—in western democracies, broadly defined. I have looked quite a bit at the civil partnership laws in the United Kingdom and Scotland, from a comparative perspective. What I can offer to the committee is an insight into what other liberal democracies have done.\n\nAs I stated in my written testimony, I support the bill’s approach. I want to end the discrimination that has been highlighted by the UK Supreme Court’s decision. I like the option of addressing discrimination by extending civil partnerships to mixed-sex or different-sex couples, because we need not only to address human rights and discrimination issues but to pluralise family policy and offer couples, of the same or of different sex, more choice. Civil partnership does that.\n\nDr Andy Hayward (Durham Law School)\n\nI am a lawyer with a background and interests that are similar to those of Dr Kollman. I look at the issues slightly differently. I am based in England, so my specialism is around the long journey that we took when introducing equal civil partnerships there, and I use a comparative perspective, drawing on different models for civil partnership reform.\n\nI support the Scottish bill, just as I supported the equal civil partnerships campaign and the legislation that was introduced in England and Wales. The basis for that support was twofold. From a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender perspective, it was to ensure that same-sex couples who were in a civil partnership—and did not convert it but chose it, when they had the option of marriage or civil partnership—should not have a relationship status that had diminished validity. I also welcomed it from the perspective of equality and choice, so that people were able to formalise a relationship in the way that they chose.\n\nMartin Loat (Equal Civil Partnerships)\n\nI am the chair of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign south of the border. I have been involved for five years, the past two as chair. I have been supporting Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, the couple who won the Supreme Court ruling about 20 months ago, as members will know.\n\nI, of course, support the bill. Our campaign has 140,000 registered supporters, and the anecdotal evidence is that about 400 to 500 couples have already entered into mixed-sex civil partnerships in England and Wales since they were introduced on 31 December. I congratulate the Scottish Parliament on the terminology around different-sex and mixed-sex partnerships. The Westminster Government’s documentation still says “opposite-sex civil partnerships”, which does not allow for any gender or transitioning that may be involved—Scotland is ahead on that.\n\nI am not an academic but a practical campaigner, and, in practice, a number of the couples who have got involved are in middle or later life. They may be divorcees or widowed or have lost a partner, and it has been moving to see the outpouring of emotion and joy on our Facebook and other social media pages when they have found that they are able to have a valid legal union with their partner due to the law change in England and Wales. Scotland should not underestimate that group, because people in their 50s, 60s and 70s have thought about the issue for a long time and know what they are doing. They are not dabbling; they have waited 20 or 30 years and now they can have a mixed-sex civil partnership. It would be tremendous if Parliament could bring that to an equivalent number of couples in Scotland.\n\nProfessor Kenneth Norrie (University of Strathclyde)\n\nI have taught and researched Scottish family law for almost 30 years. In the past 15 years, the major legal development in family law across the world has been dealing with LGBT people, in particular, with regard to civil partnership and then the opening of marriage to same-sex couples. That has been a major focus of my research for a long time.\n\nI support the bill, but my support is possibly a little more ambivalent than that of my colleagues here today. It is far better than the current situation; it was clear even before the Supreme Court told us so that giving same-sex couples more apparent choice than opposite-sex couples was unsustainable. It is a good bill in the sense that it tackles that issue. I would have preferred it to do something else, but I can live with the fact that it is not doing that—I am perfectly happy with that. As the parliamentary process progresses, details may need to be tweaked a little, particularly in relation to gender recognition.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWe will certainly have the opportunity to explore all the detail as we go on.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton (Edinburgh Western) (LD)\n\nI thank the witnesses for their introductory remarks, which were very interesting. Before I ask my substantive question, I will follow up with a brief supplementary question on Professor Norrie’s statement. You said that you would rather the bill had been something else. For the benefit of the committee, can you define what that something else might look like?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nGiven that the status quo was unacceptable—that is clearly the case—the options were to either follow the Scandinavian or Irish approach, which effectively involves winding down civil partnership, or to adopt the approach that has been taken by countries such as New Zealand and England, which is to open civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples. Purely from a legal perspective, it seems to me that it is inefficient law to have two institutions to do the job of one, which leads me to a preference for having one institution. Personally, I do not terribly care what it is called.\n\nIt is efficient law reform to have one institution to which everyone can have equal access—although I must keep emphasising that the bill is much better than the status quo. We currently have two institutions and the bill will make those two institutions virtually indistinguishable, except in name and the social and emotional values that the name carries.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nYou referred to two institutions and, obviously, the other one is marriage. Do you accept that, for many people, the term and concept of marriage carries with it a great deal of baggage and even stigma that they would wish to avoid, although they would still like to unify in the eyes of the law and the people who care about them, and that those people would rather have two options? No one in the political universe is going to suggest that we wind down the institution of marriage.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nHmm.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nOkay—you can plead the fifth amendment on that.\n\nMy substantive question is for the whole panel. From the English experience and in the Scottish context, when we first created civil partnerships, it was obviously a political answer, as much as anything else, to meet the desire of same-sex couples for their unions to be recognised in law. What are your reflections on why, when the original civil partnership legislation was introduced, the inclusion of mixed-sex couples was not considered?\n\nMartin Loat\n\nPerhaps I can answer that question, having been involved in the campaign in England and Wales for a few years. My understanding is that David Cameron, who was Prime Minister at the time of the introduction of same-sex marriage, insisted that it was all about promoting marriage and rejected all ideas that were put to him in favour of full equalisation. So, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 in England and Wales was passed without the fourth component—the full equalisation of mixed-sex civil partnership.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nMy question was not really about the legislation that brought in same-sex marriage; it was about the precursor legislation that introduced civil partnerships. Right out of the traps, civil partnerships were only for same-sex couples, but was the inclusion of mixed-sex couples considered at the time?\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI do not know for sure, but that was in 2004, which is 16 years ago. My sense is that a desire for a civil partnership option for mixed-sex couples is a more recent movement. There was no campaign for it and there are no records that we can find of anyone in 2004 doing what we have been doing for the past two years. I do not know for sure, but I think that it was just not a talking point.\n\nDr Hayward\n\nBefore the Civil Partnership Act 2004, there were two private member’s bills on the subject: Lord Lester of Herne Hill introduced one and Jane Griffiths MP introduced one in the House of Commons. Those bills included mixed-sex civil partnerships. It was felt at the time that it would be better to tackle the issue for same-sex couples directly, because they did not have any access to any method of formalisation. It was felt that addressing the detriment that same-sex couples suffered was a greater priority than the need to find an alternative to marriage.\n\nThe bills had some support—particularly Lord Lester’s bill. However, Lord Lester decided to withdraw his bill in order to pave the way for the bill that became the 2004 act.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nGiven that there was a body of support for that approach in Westminster, were there no attempts during the passage of the 2004 act to introduce amendments to make such civil partnerships available to mixed-sex couples?\n\n09:15\n\nDr Hayward\n\nThere were attempts, which you can read in Hansard—the issue was raised in Parliament—but it was felt that that bill did not provide the opportunity to deal with the issue and that it was not right to use it as a method of protecting mixed-sex couples. It was felt that the Law Commission should review cohabitation and should focus on mixed-sex couples in that arena. We adopted a similar approach to that of the Scandinavian and Nordic countries by focusing on a functional equivalent to marriage at a time when same-sex marriage was not politically viable.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nIn 2004, when the Civil Partnership Bill was going through Parliament, the major political imperative to ensure the passage of the bill was to insulate it from marriage. There were comments from Jacqui Smith, who was the lead minister at Westminster, that the bill was not about marriage and that it did not attack that ancient and wonderful institution. There was a political imperative at the time to say that same-sex couples were different to mixed-sex couples. That argument was used to glean support for the bill. However, that was 16 years ago and the world, particularly in this area, has been transformed. Those debates would have far less purchase today, but they were important at the time.\n\nThere were attempts to amend and widen the bill. Generally, those came from people who were opposed to the whole idea: they were wrecking amendments. For example, there was an amendment calling for any two people, such as brothers and sisters, to be able to have a civil partnership. People talked about spinster sisters. Why should spinster sisters not get an inheritance tax benefit when all those gay people are being given it? That was the sort of argument we heard. That was all peripheral to the main issue of allowing same-sex couples to access all the legal rights, remedies, obligations and responsibilities that opposite-sex couples have had for centuries.\n\nMary Fee (West Scotland) (Lab)\n\nProfessor Norrie, your answer to the last question leads on to my first, which is about the legal and social differences between marriage and civil partnership. You touched on survivor benefits, which is one key difference that we have heard about. Can you expand on the legal and social differences between marriage and civil partnership?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nWhen it comes to issues such as survivor benefits, the major difference is not between the institution of marriage and the institution of civil partnership. The problem is that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 were not retrospective. That meant that, when same-sex couples who had been living for decades as if they had entered into one of those institutions were finally able to do so, any benefits that they had built up—for example in pension contributions—were not counted. It took a Supreme Court decision—using European Union law, by the way—to say that that approach was unlawful. That retrospectivity is an issue.\n\nIf I can give a personal example, I have been in a partnership for 31 years. If one of us dies, or if we separate and there is a divorce, the law will only recognise 10 years of togetherness. That is a much more important issue than the differences between marriage and civil partnerships.\n\nIn relation to the legal differences between marriage and civil partnership, the two institutions have been designed to be as close as possible, which is good. One major legal difference—but, really, who cares?—is on the grounds for divorce or dissolution; for mixed-sex and same-sex marriage, adultery is one of the grounds, but it is not a ground for dissolving civil partnerships. However, you can get round that by other means.\n\nThe other major difference—which I would much prefer was tackled in the bill, because the issue has a real effect rather than an emotional effect—involves access to religious marriage. The 2014 act opened religious marriages to same-sex couples, and we thought that that gave us equal marriage. However, it did not, because each religious organisation has to opt in. There are something like 25 religious bodies in Scotland that have registered with the registrar general for Scotland as being willing to offer mixed-sex marriages; same-sex couples have the choice of about three. That approach is written into the 2014 act and it really limits the choice that same-sex couples have compared with mixed-sex couples. That is the sort of thing that I would much prefer to be tackled in the bill, instead of having a good bill that simply allows people to call their relationship what they want to call it.\n\nMary Fee\n\nThat is interesting. We will come to the issue of adultery later. On the issue that you raised on retrospective rights, do you foresee a time when that will be addressed? Would that be done through a stand-alone piece of legislation? Would there need to be lots of tweaks done to existing marriage laws to fix that?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nIt is not to do with marriage laws; it is in the Equality Act 2010. It would be a simple and relatively straightforward process to amend that. There are jurisdictional issues between the two Parliaments, but there is no need to go into the marriage legislation or the civil partnership legislation, except that the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 contains the provision that says something like, “This is not contrary to the Equality Act 2010 if we don’t make it retrospective.”\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI will make a couple of points on the experience in England and Wales. I depart from Professor Norrie’s view to some extent. He has stated that the technical legal differences between civil partnership and marriage are very minimal, but I want to focus more on the emotional, cultural and symbolic differences between the two institutions, and the meaning that marriage and civil partnership have for some people.\n\nI appreciate that the Scottish legislation is slightly different to that in England and Wales but, on the point about adultery being a ground for divorce and non-consummation being a ground for annulment, in both cases you are, in effect, entering into an institution in which an outside party is making a comment on the sex lives of the individuals. Civil partnership legislation is silent on that matter, leaving it up to the couple to decide how they want to organise things. Particularly for an older couple coming together for a union, their knowing that if their marriage was not consummated it would not be valid might put them under undue pressure.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nWe do not have consummation in Scotland—well, we have consummation—[Laughter.]\n\nMartin Loat\n\nTo some extent, yes—\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\n—but it is not a legal ground.\n\nMartin Loat\n\nYes, in relation to the legislation, there is a difference. Thank you, Professor Norrie.\n\nThe other point that I will make is that, when same-sex marriage was introduced, many couples who had been in a same-sex civil partnership understandably wanted to change that to a marriage. That means that they must have seen a difference that, to them, made it worth moving from one institution to the other.\n\nIf there is another group who are married but see that a mixed-sex civil partnership is the choice for them, I would argue that the emotional differences must work both ways. I do not remember people saying to same-sex couples when same-sex marriage was introduced, “Well, you’ve already got civil partnership. Why do you want to get married then?” and being given arguments about the legal definitions being quite similar. People understood the emotional differences, so I would argue that the reverse should apply.\n\nMary Fee\n\nDoes Dr Hayward or Dr Coleman have any comments to make?\n\nDr Kollman\n\nI echo what Martin Loat has just said. The legal differences between the two institutions are not huge, either in Scotland or in England and Wales, but the symbolism matters a great deal; indeed, as Martin Loat just said, it matters both ways. The symbolism of marriage obviously meant a lot for the legitimacy of same-sex couples but, on the other hand, it comes with a history that still has consequences for behaviour today. Some people embrace that history, but others do not. The choice is therefore an important one.\n\nDr Hayward\n\nI agree with that. The legal distinctions between civil partnership and same-sex marriage are very tight—indeed, they are insignificant. However, the important idea—bearing in mind that formalised statuses are meant to evolve in society—is that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 enables couples to imprint their values on their relationship. Yes, there are some echoes of marriage in terms of the 2004 act, but that act can evolve and give parties the ability to express themselves through that act. I agree with Martin Loat and Dr Kollman that the symbolic values cannot just be sidelined but are quite significant for the couples.\n\nMary Fee\n\nThat is helpful. Thank you. I am conscious of the time, so I will just briefly cover the issue of adultery, because a couple of other witnesses have already touched on it. Do you think that, in order to have true equality across whatever kind of institution couples want to enter into, adultery should be a ground for dissolution of any kind of partnership?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nI would say the reverse. I completely agree with Martin Loat that the law should not be getting involved in looking at people’s sex lives. I would remove the issue of adultery from the legislation. I would remove any interest that our legislation has in the sex lives of adults who are involved in personal relationships.\n\nDr Hayward\n\nI agree with Professor Norrie that adultery should not be a consideration in relation to marriage or civil partnership. However, I would recommend, as an interim measure, that civil partnerships should not recognise adultery at all for mixed-sex and same-sex partnerships. We should also consider down the line—some of the consultation responses touch on this—an overhaul of divorce law. We have a bill currently before the House of Lords—the Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill—that would remove the issue of fault completely from our divorce law and get rid of the issue of adultery completely. There would simply be a statement of marital breakdown, subject to a time period. That would be a much more progressive, modern approach.\n\nMary Fee\n\nOkay. That is helpful. Thank you.\n\nOliver Mundell (Dumfriesshire) (Con)\n\nI want to come back to Professor Norrie on the question of legal efficiency and push it slightly further. Is there an element of the law having to take into account the social and emotional feelings of the people that it is meant to govern? Is that a different form of efficiency?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nDo not get me wrong, because I agree that the law has a symbolic role to play. A really good example of that is the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, which, in reality, gave to same-sex couples very little that they did not already have under the 2004 act in terms of legal consequence. The party that you have to create the relationship, the involvement of ministers and all those sorts of things are different. However, in terms of actual legal consequences, the 2014 act did virtually nothing. That was not the point of the 2014 act, though; the point of that act was symbolism. It declared very clearly that 2,000 years of discrimination against LGBT people, official disparagement of LGBT people and a status-based assumption in the law were all over. It was a very powerful and important piece of Scottish Parliament legislation.\n\n09:30\n\nThere is symbolism in the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill but, for me, it does not have the same purchase. Some people reject marriage because it has a patriarchal, religious history—of course, that is true. However, to me, it is a bit like a woman saying, “I’m not going to vote, because the voting rules used to be patriarchal and were designed to keep men in power and women out of power.” The world has moved on and marriage has evolved. I dislike the phrase “equal marriage”, which was the big, powerful slogan that was used. It served its purpose, but I much prefer the term “gender-neutral marriage”. I think that the 2014 act has created gender-neutral marriage.\n\nIn my view, marriage has been saved as an institution that is open to everybody as a result of the 2014 act. Because of that, I see the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill as being far less powerful. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that it has symbolic and emotional purchase for some people.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nFrom a legal point of view, that would be a legitimate ground for doing something.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nYes.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nI just wanted to clarify that, for the sake of balance.\n\nThe Convener\n\nBefore you go on, Oliver, Dr Kollman would like to comment.\n\nDr Kollman\n\nI agree with a lot of what Professor Norrie has just said. It is true that, from the point of view of symbolism and opening up marriage, the 2014 act had more punch. However, I do not agree completely with the analogy with voting for women. The history of women being excluded from voting does not necessarily impact on women’s behaviour today when they think about voting or participating in politics, whereas the history of marriage—of course marriage has evolved a lot; I am not saying anything against marriage today—still has an impact on how people behave today. That is a big difference. That is why the symbolism of the bill is important.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nDo you have any concerns about the interim plan to recognise different-sex civil partnerships from the rest of the UK as marriages in Scotland?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nAs I read the bill, the interim plan is that if different-sex civil partnerships come into force in the rest of the UK before they do in Scotland, those partnerships will be treated as marriages in Scotland until such time as our bill becomes effective. I see no conceptual difficulty with that whatsoever. For 10 years between 2004 and 2014, our legislatures were perfectly comfortable in telling same-sex couples who married abroad that, when they came to this country, they were in civil partnerships and would be treated as such. A lot of people did not like that, but the law managed and accommodated the situation. That was a mechanism—a clumsy and unfortunate mechanism—to allow people’s legal rights and responsibilities to flow, and that is what the interim measures in the bill will do. In that respect, the bill is simply following a pattern.\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI need to comment, not just because of my role in the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign but as somebody who is in a mixed-sex civil partnership that is recognised in England and Wales. I am in the target group and, given everything that we have been through on a campaigning level, I would have a huge problem in principle with the proposal that, in the interim period, the relationship that I am in would be treated as a marriage if I were to move to or operate in Scotland. That would undercut what I have spent five years campaigning for, to the point that I might not want to come to Scotland until the position changed. I have not gone through all of that just to be treated as married for technical expediency. It is not for me to tell you how to run your laws, but I urge you to either rethink the position or move very quickly through the process so that it becomes a purely theoretical point. It sticks in my throat that the relationship that I am in would be treated as marriage, given that I am a campaigner for mixed-sex civil partnerships.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nFollowing on from that, is there a similar concern about how civil partnerships are seen and whether they are recognised overseas? I know that that is already an issue for some people. For both forms of civil partnership—mixed sex and same sex—are there concerns about how they are seen in other jurisdictions and what rights extend to civil partners?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nIt is an inevitable problem that, if the Scottish Parliament creates or expands an institution, the Scottish Parliament has no power to tell the rest of the world to recognise that institution. I do not think that we should be hung up about that; we have to do what is right for Scotland and for people who live in and come to Scotland. We cannot influence Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia or any other country that is not going to recognise our relationships. I have sympathy for Martin Loat if he feels that his relationship is not properly recognised in Scotland. If I go to half of the countries in the world, not only would I not be regarded as being in a legally recognised relationship that is called something that I do not want it to be called, my relationship would not be recognised at all. I would effectively be divorced every time I got off an aeroplane in some countries. Some years ago, I was told by immigration officers in some countries that I was no longer in a relationship simply because I crossed a border.\n\nNo Parliament on this planet can tell every other country what to do—that is an inevitable consequence of different legal systems having different problems. The issue is the reverse one: what we do when people come to Scotland. That is the important issue. Again, I have sympathy for Martin Loat and I understand the issue because, in a sense I have also faced it, although, frankly, in a more severe form. It would not be technically problematic for the bill to be amended to say that mixed-sex civil partnerships that are validly created abroad will be recognised here, even though people cannot enter into one here yet. I would draw an analogy with polygamous marriages. You cannot enter into a polygamous marriage in this country; however, if parties validly enter into a polygamous marriage in a country that allows it, and if the parties are domiciled there or are nationals, and they come here, they will still be married. I see no technical problem with the bill being amended in the way that Martin Loat wants it to be. I would support such an amendment.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nThat is helpful, thank you.\n\nAngela Constance (Almond Valley) (SNP)\n\nI am keen that we distil the benefits surrounding different-sex partnerships. The panel has touched on the benefits, and Oliver Mundell has spoken about the social and emotional aspects. In answer to Mary Fee’s questions, some of the more practical benefits for pension rights were touched on. In thinking about the benefits of different-sex partnerships, can we focus on the rights that they give people? I am particularly thinking about the different rights that people have in comparison to those that they would have if they were cohabiting. Even in Scotland, where rights are enhanced, if people cohabit for a lengthy period of time, that is still not the same as marriage.\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI will leave the detail to the family law academics. In England and Wales, we faced a challenge in educating people that there is no such thing as a common-law marriage. Many couples who were cohabiting thought that they had rights, although that number might be reducing now. In practical terms, that often affects the woman in the relationship more if the man works, has accrued some wealth and has then left. The woman might think that she will get equal shares, but that might not be the case. We have argued that the civil partnership for mixed-sex couples provides a lighter and easier way to get the legal recognition and protection that would apply to both sides of the couple in that example and protect the children.\n\nI will leave it to others to talk about the fine detail but, from the point of view of our campaign, a mixed-sex civil partnership is an easy and doable way to get equal rights. It costs £46.\n\nDr Hayward\n\nWe have touched on some of the legal benefits, but there is also the idea that the mixed-sex civil partnership is a status. There is formalisation. There is a start date and potentially an end date, and that will generate the ability to calculate and accrue benefits. There are the standard benefits of protection on relationship breakdown, which are really important. I note that section 28 of the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 allows for a cohabitation claim. I know that the Scottish Law Commission is reviewing that. We do not have that in England. Although I welcome cohabitation reform in England and Wales and think that it is the next area for us to go into, the fact that you have that here is quite important. However, reform is needed.\n\nCivil partnerships will certainly be attractive in protecting vulnerable couples. They will be popular in England and Wales—we will probably have a surge in demand—but they will not remove the pressing need for a broader, blanket safety net for all couples.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nAndy Hayward is quite right that the approach does not tackle the real issue in England. There is an argument that opening up civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples is more urgent in England and Wales than it is in Scotland because they do not have cohabitation provisions in the way that we do. We have succession claims, claims on separation, and financial adjustments at those difficult periods of people’s lives.\n\nThe real issue is the choice between a registered relationship—whether that is a marriage or a civil partnership—and an unregistered relationship. One of the real problems in England is that Parliament has consistently refused to deal with the issue of unregistered relationships. If a person does not register with whichever institution, they are left in an extremely vulnerable position.\n\nMartin Loat is quite right to say that all the research and statistics show that people believe that they have a so-called common-law marriage, but they do not: they have nothing. In Scotland, it is quite different. People already have a choice of whether to register their relationship and get the full gamut of rights and responsibilities or not to register their relationship, in which case the law will protect the vulnerable.\n\nThe bill is all about registered relationships. It does not address—and it is not the place to address—any further amendments in relation to cohabiting, unregistered couples.\n\n09:45\n\nAngela Constance\n\nProfessor Norrie, are there enhanced rights in Scotland for people in a civil partnership or a marriage compared with the situation for people who cohabit? Am I right in thinking that that is because of issues to do with pensions and exclusion orders for perpetrators of domestic violence and that there are other quite discrete nuances?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nYou are right, except in relation to the domestic violence legislation, which is very carefully designed to cover all types of couples. Your fundamental point is absolutely right: if a person is in a registered relationship, they have enhanced protections. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament deliberately chose to keep lesser protections for cohabiting couples in order not to undermine the institution of marriage. That is how the argument went at the time. Therefore, there is a hierarchy with marriage and civil partnership at the top, then cohabitants, and then people who perhaps do not live together but are in long-term relationships.\n\nAngela Constance\n\nThank you. That is helpful.\n\nDr Kollman\n\nI will not talk members through the details of the different laws, because the family lawyers can do that. However, on policy needs, it is very clear that family types are continually diversifying and that cohabitants in particular are becoming a much more common family type. The law on cohabitants here is very helpful but, as Andy Hayward has already said, the Scottish Law Commission is looking into whether it is adequate, given that quite a bit has changed since 2006 with regard to how people live their lives and form families. It is worth looking at whether the law on cohabitants is really doing the job that we need it to do, given how society is today.\n\nMary Fee\n\nI want to return to the issue of gender recognition, which Professor Norrie touched on in an earlier response. In your submission, Professor Norrie, you questioned whether the full implications have been worked out for the situation in which one party to an existing civil partnership or marriage changes gender. Will you expand on your comments and explain what difficulties you envisage? Perhaps the rest of the panel can then give their views.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nThe practical difficulty is that there are currently two bills before the Scottish Parliament: the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill, which we are considering today, and the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill, which may be just a draft bill—I cannot remember. The situation is a repeat of what happened in 2004, when the Civil Partnership Bill was going through Westminster. That was followed very quickly thereafter by the Gender Recognition Act 2004. The interplay between those pieces of legislation became very clumsy. The Scottish Parliament faces the same clumsiness this year, which is really unfortunate. If you could combine the two pieces of legislation, many of the problems would be resolved. The main problem is that the situation is overly complex. It seems to me that, once marriage—\n\nMary Fee\n\nIf I may interrupt you, is the situation overly complex by necessity, because of the law, or because we have made it overly complex?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nWe have made it overly complex, but the approach was designed to deal with the fact that, in 2004, there was a complete separation of same-sex relationships and mixed-sex relationships and civil partnerships and marriage. Therefore, if one of the parties in either a civil partnership or a marriage changed gender, that relationship had to come to an end because we could not accommodate a different gender mix in either of the relationships. The marriage legislation half dealt with the problem because, with marriage, gender does not matter now. That is why I prefer the term “gender neutral”.\n\nThe Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill will make civil partnership gender neutral, which is good. If we had started from the point that both relationships are gender neutral, the transgender issue simply would not arise, because it would not matter. However, instead, we are trying to replicate the complex provisions of interim gender recognition certificates while people are in a relationship in order to protect the other party and so on. We do not need all that. If a person in a relationship changes gender and the other person cannot accept or accommodate that and no longer wishes to be in that relationship, the divorce courts can deal with it. That is not a difficult thing. Instead, we are trying to replicate the sensitivities that we created in 2004 in a different world to deal with a different situation.\n\nMary Fee\n\nWhat are the views of the rest of the panel on that?\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI broadly agree with Professor Norrie. I have another point to make in a moment, so I will save time by passing on this one.\n\nDr Kollman\n\nI, too, am broadly in agreement with Professor Norrie.\n\nDr Hayward\n\nPart 5 of the Civil Partnership (Opposite-sex Couples) Regulations 2019—those are the regulations that brought in mixed-sex civil partnerships in England and Wales—has allowed an individual with a full gender recognition certificate to be able to have a mixed-sex civil partnership without having to dissolve the original civil partnership, provided that their partner consents to that. There is an alignment so that there is no break in the relationship—people can switch between the different types of status, which is welcome.\n\nWe are consulting on the issue. I hope that we will be able to change the Gender Recognition Act 2004 through consultation, but that process has stalled. It might be premature to move on that.\n\nMary Fee\n\nProfessor Norrie, are you suggesting that the draft gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill, which is out for consultation, is the means to remedy the issue? If an amendment were made to that bill when it reaches the Scottish Parliament, would something need to be done to the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill so that they mirror each other, or would the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill be the only one that needed to be changed?\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nI do not know. As I said in my written submission, the committee needs to look at the matter carefully. The clean and sensible place to deal with it is probably in the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill. In that case, the provisions in the Civil Partnjership (Scotland) Bill amending the Gender Recognition Act 2004 would need to be reconsidered.\n\nMary Fee\n\nThank you. That is very helpful.\n\nAnnie Wells (Glasgow) (Con)\n\nGood morning, panel. What are your views on allowing married couples to convert their marriage to a civil partnership and vice versa?\n\nMartin Loat\n\nI very much want to come in on that point. The Westminster Government has got itself into knots on the issue, specifically in relation to converting a mixed-sex or traditional marriage to a mixed-sex civil partnership. That is still out for consultation in England and Wales—it was kicked out of the Westminster bill at the last minute, perhaps because it was seen as controversial and possibly opening the door to objections from the church and other religious groups. There is an opportunity in Scotland to neaten things up and get it all clarified.\n\nThere is an argument that couples who find themselves in traditional marriages and realise that they would have had a mixed-sex civil partnership had it been available should be able to convert. The Equal Civil Partnerships campaign position is that we totally agree with that. We do not want there to be any time limit on that—we do not want people to have only two years or 18 months in which to make their decision.\n\nWe have two main reasons for saying that, the first of which is practical. A couple might be living and working overseas in a jurisdiction that does not recognise mixed-sex civil partnerships, so they might feel that they have to get married. In five years’ time, they might move back here—to Scotland, England or Wales—and find that the ship has sailed on the conversion opportunity.\n\nThe other reason is more a social or societal one. We feel that we are on the verge of seeing a new social construct in the mixed-sex civil partnership. Who knows how that might mature or develop? My view is that support for it is silently building and that it will become more popular. In five, 10 or 15 years from now, it could become the norm for many people, who might see others in their peer group entering into such partnerships. If, at that time, a married couple were to decide that they understood the differences and that they would rather be in a civil partnership and wanted to convert to one, the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign would not want that not to be allowed. To me, that would be like saying that we made provisions for veganism 20 years ago but that, if someone now declares that they are vegan, they can be one for evermore. We know that society changes and that things suddenly become more popular and other people want to join in. We would argue for an open-ended ability to convert from a traditional marriage to a mixed-sex civil partnership.\n\nDr Kollman\n\nI broadly agree. The issue is partly about increasing people’s choices in how they structure their lives. Leaving such choices open for as long as we can and making the options as liberal as we can would be good.\n\nI echo what Martin Loat said. It would also be useful to consider examples from other countries. In France, the pacte civil de solidarité—PACS—is what we might call a registered partnership-lite arrangement. It has become increasingly popular over the years—so much so that, for every five marriages, there are now four PACs. The form of registered partnership that is available in the Netherlands, which is open to both mixed-sex and same-sex couples, was previously never all that popular for a variety of reasons, but it has recently become increasingly more so. Things are changing. In other European countries, the direction of travel is similar in that registered partnerships have become more popular for mixed-sex couples.\n\nProfessor Norrie\n\nThere is a fundamental flaw in the bill that will come back to haunt the Parliament. The idea is to do for mixed-sex couples what we previously did for same-sex couples. That is fine. However, when same-sex marriage came in, what we did for those couples was to give those who were already in civil partnerships the choice of either staying in them or converting to marriage. Conversion could be done through two mechanisms: by a purely administrative one or by getting married. I do not think that the marriage option is available in England. At any rate, the point is that people in same-sex civil partnerships can convert to marriage. I think that, for the first year, all fees were waived on the ground that those people had previously had only one option but now had two and that, if they wanted to take the second option, they should not have to pay for that. That model should have been adopted here.\n\nFrom my reading of the policy memorandum, I think that the Scottish Government has deliberately chosen not to allow people in marriages to convert to civil partnerships. I presume that that was through fear of undermining the institution of marriage, but it should have done so. If the whole point of the exercise is to do for opposite-sex couples what has previously been done for same-sex couples, we should do it all. We should allow mixed-sex couples who married but would now prefer to have civil partnerships the opportunity to have them. For the first year, we should not charge them for doing that. We should simply follow the model that we successfully adopted in 2014.\n\nAnnie Wells\n\nI think that all my questions have been answered. Thank you very much.\n\nThe Convener\n\nIf Oliver Mundell’s supplementary question is brief, we can probably fit it in.\n\nOliver Mundell\n\nI think that Professor Norrie has captured the point that I was going to make.\n\nThe Convener\n\nOkay. That brings our session to an end. I thank our witnesses very much for giving their evidence, which has been very helpful. I suspend the meeting briefly to allow for a change of witnesses.\n\n09:59 Meeting suspended.\n\n10:02 On resuming—\n\nThe Convener\n\nAgenda item 2 is the Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill, on which we will take oral evidence from two panels. I welcome our first panel: Fiona Blair, president of the Association of Registrars of Scotland; Rod Burns, deputy registrar general at the National Records of Scotland; Fraser Sutherland, chief executive of the Humanist Society Scotland; and Ephraim Borowski, director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities. You are all very welcome this morning, and I thank you for being with us.\n\nI will start off by asking you to tell us briefly about your organisation and whether you support the general principles of the bill.\n\nFiona Blair (Association of Registrars of Scotland)\n\nI am the president of the Association of Registrars of Scotland, which is also known as AROS. We have been representing Scottish local authority registrars since 1865. AROS provides a valuable networking group for registrars and assistant registrars and, as an association, we are very proactive in contributing towards a workable and customer-friendly registration system. We work closely with National Records of Scotland, provide professional advice on registration procedures and take part in working groups such as this. We are in favour of opening up civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.\n\nFraser Sutherland (Humanist Society Scotland)\n\nThe Humanist Society Scotland is the national body for humanists in Scotland. We have 15,000 members across the country, and many people know us for providing ceremonies at weddings, funerals and naming ceremonies. We are very supportive of opening up civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples.\n\nEphraim Borowski (Scottish Council of Jewish Communities)\n\nI am the director of the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities, or SCoJeC. We are an umbrella body for all the organised Jewish communities in Scotland, which are the ones in the cities. We also work very closely with the scattered Jewish population in more remote areas. We have just finished a piece of research that looks not at this kind of issue but at the issues that concern Jewish people in Scotland in general.\n\nThe Convener\n\nDo you support the general principles of the bill?\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI should put on record that there are political issues—with a small “p”—on which it is not possible to speak with a single view on behalf of an ethnically and religiously diverse community such as the Jewish community. Therefore, I will probably be speaking for a kind of consensus, which is that we are unlikely to be very much engaged with this but do not have any objections to it. However, individuals and groups in the community have diverse views.\n\nRod Burns (National Records of Scotland)\n\nNational Records of Scotland is a non-ministerial department of the Scottish Government. We oversee the registration system and provide support and training in relation to the information technology process and that kind of thing, in order to implement Scottish Government policy around registration. We support the bill.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWhat implications, if any, might the bill have for your organisations?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nWe do not think that there will be many implications apart from the initial set-up. Our social work departments would need to incorporate forced civil partnership along with forced marriage. That would mean a change to their interagency guidance and, possibly, training, which would mean releasing registrars to come down to Edinburgh to do centralised training, with the associated travel costs. However, apart from that, we cannot think of anything that would impact on our service.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nThe implications for us would be much the same as those that Fiona Blair has described. We would update the training and information that we provide. Many of our celebrants are already trained to provide civil partnerships for same-sex couples, and the procedures would be the same; we would just update our celebrants on what was available.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nThere may well be two points where the bill will affect us. First, we have a semi-official role through a concordat with NRS. If a couple in which one partner is from Scotland and the other is from anywhere else in the world want to be married by a rabbi from “back home”, wherever that is, NRS is required to check the bona fides of that individual. However, it does not—quite rightly—want to get involved in the internal divisions between groups in the Jewish community, so it has a single, one-stop shop: SCoJeC. NRS asks us to go to the relevant branch of Judaism and check out the individual. That will apply for civil partnerships just as it does, at the moment, for marriage.\n\nThe second, more important, point concerns the inclusion of section 9 of the bill, which is about religious divorce. I very much welcome that section. At the moment, the only listed faith is Judaism, but the same provision might be available for other faiths if they wanted it, which is why the provision is written in general terms. That is important, because it mirrors the clause in the Divorce (Scotland) Act 1976, which has been extremely useful and has, as far as we are aware, put an end to the abuse that there used to be.\n\nRod Burns\n\nFor NRS, adding mixed-sex civil partnerships will simply add a complementary new function. As Fiona Blair said, there will resource implications in the initial set-up. We will make changes to the forward electronic register, which is the national electronic database for registration; system changes will have to be made; there will be training of registrars; the process will have to be amended; and our handbook will need to be updated. We will have to devote resources to setting up the system, but, once it is up and running, it will become part of business as usual. It will be complementary to same-sex civil partnerships, which Fiona Blair would agree have become a regular part of registration business and are completely unproblematic.\n\nAlison Harris\n\nGood morning. What are the legal and social differences between marriage and civil partnership? Can you explain those?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nIt is confusing for the public, who often ask us what the differences are. I understand that adultery cannot be cited as a reason for the dissolution of a civil partnership, whereas it can be cited in a divorce case. There is very little difference between civil partnership and marriage regarding legal rights, which have been protected and changed over time. It is confusing for the public, and it would be good to have clear guidance.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nI will not speak much about the legal side; you have people who are far more expert than me here to do that.\n\nYou have received quite a lot of written evidence from couples and individuals who see the historical context of marriage as something they do not want to enter into. Civil partnership is more attractive to them because of how marriage has historically been framed.\n\nIt is interesting that, since the introduction of same-sex marriage, a lot of same-sex couples have chosen to get married rather than to opt for civil partnerships when they have that choice. There has been historical discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, who have been unable to have a wedding. That is no longer an issue, which may have changed some of the social aspect of marriage.\n\nThe social aspect changed dramatically during the 20th century. Marriage used to be a religious thing; then registration services, on behalf of the Government, became the most popular choice. From the turn of the century, since 2005, humanist marriages have become a thing. There is a growing popular demand for humanist marriage, which, in the words of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, is a “belief marriage” as opposed to a religious or Government-based service. The social landscape of marriage changed considerably over the 20th century and has also changed since the 2005 decision to allow for a belief body and following the 2014 change in the law to recognise belief marriages.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nThe difference for the Jewish community would be minimal. The reason why we need section 9 is that, in the case of marriage, a single ceremony creates two marriages: civil marriage and religious marriage. If a marriage is going to come to an end, both marriages will need to be terminated, and the processes are different.\n\nThe reason why I said that the bill would not have much practical impact is that the reasons that people give for wanting civil partnerships rather than marriage would make it almost contradictory for them also to want to have a religious marriage ceremony. It may be that this does not come about, but, in effect, Judaism recognises marriage by custom and repute—for want of a better phrase—in that publicly living together still requires a religious divorce. From that point of view, if someone were to go down the new path envisaged by the bill, it would make very little difference at all.\n\nRod Burns\n\nWe work quite closely with the Scottish Government and provide input when it is developing new policy on something like this. However, we set ourselves squarely in the role of implementing whatever the law ends up being. In general, NRS refrains from taking a view on the social impact of something, even though people who work in NRS are quite interested in marriage and civil partnership. We are at the receiving end of settled policy, and we work carefully with registrars, the Scottish Government and other stakeholders to ensure that we are implementing things fairly and transparently.\n\nCivil marriage was introduced in 1940 and, since then, we have had civil partnerships and the introduction of the category of belief marriages—those are all staging posts along the way of new settled policy, which we are working to implement. We do not take a view on the social benefits, although there clearly are social benefits; we just crack on with doing a good job of implementation.\n\nMaurice Golden\n\nFiona Blair mentioned that one of the differences between marriage and civil partnership is in the grounds for divorce or dissolution, specifically in relation to adultery. Do the panel members have any views on that specific subject?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nI have no views on that; I would never get involved in the divorce or dissolution aspect of a marriage—that would be dealt with legally.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nThere is a wider question about reviewing the whole of the divorce legislation and how it sits at the moment. Many voices are saying that the separation requirements in divorce legislation are not modern and up-to-date in relation to how people’s lives work. There have been some high-profile cases down south. It is time for a wholesale review of that legislation, rather than just of that issue.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI agree with that. In Judaism, marriage is entered into voluntarily and the contract is ended equally voluntarily by the parties. Therefore, in a sense, the only ground for religious divorce is irretrievable breakdown—the parties say, “This marriage has come to an end.” Anything that goes towards that level playing field would be consistent with where we are coming from.\n\nRod Burns\n\nWe do not have a view on that issue.\n\nFulton MacGregor (Coatbridge and Chryston) (SNP)\n\nI want to ask about the benefits of introducing different-sex civil partnerships. What might the impact be on different equality groups? We have had submissions from Engender, Children in Scotland and others, letting us know what they think the benefits might be. Do you have any views on that?\n\n09:15\n\nFiona Blair\n\nI think that the introduction of the ability to recognise mixed-sex civil partnerships will be good from an equality point of view and will give us parity with other areas of the United Kingdom. It is already possible to enter into such partnerships in England. Since that law has been implemented in England, as registrars, we have had 47 inquiries in 11 local authority areas from people who want to enter into a mixed-sex civil partnership in Scotland. That is just a small sample that I took before coming to the meeting.\n\nThe reasons that people give for wanting to do that vary. For some, it is their personal preference; they see marriage as a one-time thing and they want something different. Some people do not want to have a ceremony—with marriage it is necessary to have some form of ceremony, whereas with a civil partnership it is just a case of registration. Some people whose marriage ended with a death do not want to get married again because they think that, if they did so, that would be seen as not honouring their first husband or wife. Many different reasons are given for wanting to enter into a mixed-sex civil partnership. From an equality point of view, I think that the introduction of the ability to do that is a good thing.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nFrom our point of view, it is important to give couples the opportunity to decide for themselves. At the moment, we have a mixed system in which some couples can choose between the two options and some couples cannot. We do not favour that, and the bill seeks to repair the situation.\n\nFiona Blair has highlighted some of the reasons why people might choose a civil partnership over a wedding. At the heart of the matter, it is a question of giving couples the choice and allowing them to decide what is right for them. A couple might have a myriad of reasons for making their choice, but it is important that we recognise that choice when they form their relationship in a legal context.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI can speak for only one equality group. Beyond that, all I would say is that, if other groups feel that the ability to enter into a mixed-sex civil partnership would benefit them, our default position is to be in favour of equality.\n\nRod Burns\n\nIt is clear that having a wider range of legal unions available to people brings a range of benefits, but there are some key groups who will benefit quite strongly, such as people who are undergoing the gender recognition process. Under the current rules, the process has always seemed quite harsh. At NRS, we take the end results of the UK gender recognition panel and implement them by making an entry in the gender recognition register. We are involved in the practical, business end of changing people’s birth certificates and facilitating the official legal recognition of their new status.\n\nIt has always seemed quite harsh and rather against the general drift on equalities that someone who was in an existing civil partnership had to dissolve it. For me, a key benefit of the bill is that it will address that. Although only a small number of people will benefit in that way, we are talking about a key equalities group.\n\nI agree with the comments of the other panel members.\n\nFulton MacGregor\n\nWhat do you think are the specific benefits of civil partnership compared with cohabitation?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nCivil partnership provides couples with better financial and legal status. Entering a civil partnership gives a couple a recognised certificate that enables them to prove that they are a couple, whereas cohabiting couples must prove that they have been together for a certain period of time.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nAs humanists, we would favour a system in which it did not matter what the legal status of a couple’s relationship was. People should be treated as equal in the eyes of the law. Lawyers would probably roll their eyes at that and say, “That would be a nightmare—how would you police that?”\n\nAs a belief body, for want of a better expression, we would say that the important thing in a relationship is the commitment between the partners. It does not really matter whether a couple has a piece of paper that says that they are in a civil partnership or a marriage or are cohabiting. What matters is the relationship at the heart of that and the commitment of the partners to each other, rather than the fact that they have a bit of paper.\n\nFulton MacGregor\n\nI hear what you are saying about the idealist point of view, but do you think that the current system provides more financial security?\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nThere are people who have excluded themselves from the marriage landscape because they do not feel that they fit into it. The civil partnership gives them the option to access the legal advantages that they would not get because they do not want to enter into marriage. That can only be a good thing.\n\nOver the years, a number of people who have wanted to enter into civil partnerships have not had that option. Some of those people might change their mind and decide they want to have a marriage instead, but some might decide they do not want any legal ceremony, so they just continue to cohabit. The civil partnership will be another option for them. Fiona Blair has highlighted how registrars have already received a number of inquiries, and, since the legal changes down south, we have had people getting in touch and asking how long it will be before they can have civil partnership as an option.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI understand that there is very little practical legal difference between the two. The reason that somebody might opt for a civil partnership is that, on the one hand, they want recognition, but, on the other hand, they reject—and this is quite clear from the English court cases on the topic—some of the baggage that comes with the term “marriage”. If that was a reason for not formalising the relationship at all, having this option, which allows them to get that recognition, and formalising it in a way that will affect children, property and so on is obviously a good thing.\n\nRod Burns\n\nI echo that stress on recognition. With many apologies to Fraser Sutherland, I do not want to disagree publicly, but NRS is in the business of producing and standing behind bits of paper, so we think that they are quite important. They are no reflection of the strength of a relationship, but they are the means by which people can rely on the formal legal recognition of their union. As I said, we think that expanding the number of options that people have to acquire that legal recognition is a good thing.\n\nI do not have any specific comment on the underlying issue.\n\nAngela Constance (Almond Valley) (SNP)\n\nThe bill replicates the provisions for religious and belief bodies to opt in if they wish to register different-sex civil partnerships. What are the witnesses’ views on those provisions? I would like to start with Mr Borowski.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI thought that you might.\n\nObviously, that is at the interface between the NRS and the community. It will not be an issue for a couple both of whom are Scots. If they are members of the Jewish community, whatever clergy their community has will automatically be recognised by the NRS as able to solemnise marriages and, if it wishes to, solemnise civil partnerships.\n\nThe problem that arises is purely practical. If the celebrant has to be somehow certified to the NRS for it to recognise the religious ceremony as creating a civil marriage or a civil partnership, the new wrinkle will be that, if one member of a couple comes from elsewhere, such as England, or from one of the different umbrella communities—the orthodox, reform or liberal community in Scotland—or potentially another branch of Judaism that does not exist in Scotland, they might want to bring a celebrant from their own community. The issue might be to do with the branch of Judaism not recognising, or not wishing to participate in, civil partnership ceremonies of any kind.\n\nWe have suggested a couple of tweaks to the wording in order to handle a case in which an individual rabbi or member of the clergy is prepared to carry out the ceremonies, but belongs to a branch that has turned its face against them. We take the view that two checks—not just one—would need to happen. If somebody performs a religious ceremony, they do so on behalf of their faith community, and therefore they cannot dissent from that community’s view while supposedly representing it. That is the thinking behind our suggested tweaks to the wording.\n\nAngela Constance\n\nWill you summarise what you think the solution is, given that—correct me if I am making wrong assumptions—pluralism will continue to exist within the Jewish community? You have made suggestions about the wording. For the record, will you explain what would help?\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nLet us start with marriage. Currently, if somebody wants to bring their rabbi from Patagonia, the NRS will ask us about the bona fides of the individual. We will then check with whichever UK or Scotland branch the individual purports to be affiliated with whether it accepts that they are affiliated, and we will pass on the answer to the NRS.\n\nThe same thing that currently happens in the case of marriage would happen in the case of a civil partnership. However, we suggest that two checks need to happen rather than just one. It should be checked that the individual is willing to conduct the ceremony—I presume that they have already been asked, otherwise the couple would not have suggested it—and that the branch that the individual claims to be affiliated with does not have a policy that would prevent one of its local members from carrying out that ceremony. That extra check would be carried out by us rather than by the NRS. We would then report to it.\n\nAngela Constance\n\nOkay. Thank you for that.\n\nMr Sutherland, would you like to add anything in reply to my root question?\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nThere is nothing specific to add. Obviously, the bill will replicate our organisation’s prescribed status under the existing legislation, which allows us to nominate celebrants in order to carry out humanist ceremonies. Nothing major would change in that process with regard to civil partnerships—things would be the same. We do not have quite the same issue that Ephraim Borowski has pointed out.\n\nQuite a lot of couples come to Scotland in order to specifically access humanist marriage, because not many countries around the world offer it. It is, notably, not available in England and Wales. The majority of the couples who want a legal humanist marriage in our sister organisation, which is based down south, choose to come to Scotland to enter into that, because they cannot have that in and England or Wales. Other European states and some US states recognise humanist marriages, but we still get quite a lot of people for them. Scotland is seen as a wedding destination—Fiona Blair could give members the statistics for that. A lot of couples choose to come to Scotland to get married for a variety of reasons, and we do only a small part of the belief marriages. However, that is important.\n\nThe option for more couples might or might not drive extra people coming to Scotland. It certainly will not do so from England and Wales, but it might from further afield, where civil partnerships for mixed-sex couples are not available.\n\nAngela Constance\n\nDo other members of the panel want to add anything? I know that neither Ms Blair nor Mr Burns is representing religious or belief bodies, but they might wish to add something, given what they have heard.\n\n09:30\n\nRod Burns\n\nYes. I simply want to add that the opt-in principle is important. We have done a bit of research, as Fiona Blair has done, on how many bodies have opted in to do the existing civil partnership ceremonies. According to our records, only 13 religious and belief bodies have opted in to the list to do them, whereas there are quite a lot more that do opposite-sex marriages, for instance.\n\nIt would be dangerous to presume that all bodies that put forward celebrants for authorisation will automatically want to do the new civil partnership ceremonies. As Ephraim Borowski said, it is not just about the body; it is also about individual celebrants. There should be no compulsion on a body to provide celebrants to do the new civil partnership ceremonies or on individual celebrants to do them. The principle of voluntary engagement has worked very well so far with the existing civil partnerships, and our general principle would be that, if that is working well for same-sex civil partnerships, we should probably replicate the process for mixed-sex civil partnerships, given that it is tried and tested.\n\nFiona Blair\n\nUntil 2014, civil partnerships were carried out by a registrar or an assistant registrar. Under the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, it was opened up for religious and belief groups to carry them out. From looking at the statistics, I note that only nine civil partnership ceremonies have been conducted by a religious or belief body. The majority have been carried out by a registrar or an assistant registrar. I do not know whether people associate the word “civil” with registration services. However, it is good to give people choice across the board. That is my view.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton (Edinburgh Western) (LD)\n\nGood morning, and thank you for your remarks so far, which have been very interesting. It has been clear to the committee since the bill was introduced that one of the drivers behind extending civil partnerships to mixed-sex couples is the not inconsiderable baggage that some people attach to the term “marriage” or the institution of marriage. For many reasons, people find it off-putting, and they do not want to go down that route. Fiona Blair articulated very well a reason that I had not heard of before, which is that, in the case of widowhood, somebody might want to honour the marriage that has gone before but solemnise the relationship that they are in now. I think that that is exactly right.\n\nSection 3 of the bill, which is entitled\n\n“Interim recognition of different sex relationships formed outwith Scotland”,\n\nrefers to jurisdictions that already have mixed-sex civil partnerships, such as England. Section 3(2)(a) suggests that a couple who have such a civil partnership and come to Scotland are, until the bill is adopted and implemented,\n\n“to be treated as being in a marriage”.\n\nLast week, it came out quite strongly that that would be a real concern to people because, as I have said, that is not what they went into and they do not want to be thought of as being in a marriage. What are your views on that? Do you see any way round it? Could we regard such people differently on implementation of the bill?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nI cannot say that I have thought about that. At present, registrars would not recognise a mixed-sex civil partnership in Scotland, but I do not really have any strong views on the subject. In the interim, recognising such civil partnerships as marriage would be difficult for people who entered into a civil partnership because that was their choice. They had the choice of marriage or a civil partnership, and they went down the civil partnership route. They did not want a marriage. I can see that people would not be happy about that but, as a registrar, I do not really have a view on that, I am afraid.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nI suppose that it comes down to the legalities and how we can recognise something that does not exist. I imagine that that is why the bill is drafted in that way.\n\nIn general, I agree with the principle that you mentioned. If people have deliberately chosen not to have a marriage, why would we classify them in that way? I suppose that the drafters would say that it is because they want to provide the protection that comes with that, as the people are in a legally recognised relationship. It is, no doubt, a tricky one to square.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI do not have very much to say about that, but I will say it nonetheless—I cannot help it. Given that there is almost no difference between the two states, I make the logic-chopping point that there is a difference between being married and being treated as being married. The interim status would merely treat two people as if they were married because there is no alternative to that at the moment. You can call it what you like, but it would merely be a recognition of something that happened somewhere else.\n\nIf I remember correctly, at your meeting last week, somebody discussed with you the analogy of polygamous marriages. You cannot have them here, but if you are misguided enough to have them somewhere else, you are treated here as being married to all the people to whom you are married. There would be something similar to that: people would be treated as if they were married, which is not the same as actually having that status.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nThat is a very helpful insight. Reading section 3(2)(a) in that context puts a slightly different spin on it.\n\nBy extension, given that we have in Scotland the institution of civil partnership, albeit that it is currently only for same-sex couples, what impediment would you see to our changing section 3(2)(a) so that it says that people would be “treated as being in a civil partnership”? I know that the institution of civil partnership for mixed-sex couples does not exist, but we can treat people as if they were in a civil partnership, because the institution does exist.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI think that you are asking me again.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nYou offered the insight, so I would be interested to hear your view on that point.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI would give you the same answer. This is turning into a bit of a philosophy tutorial.\n\nI would have given you exactly the same answer if it had been the other way round: treating two people as if they were in a civil partnership would not actually create a civil partnership. From that point of view, I am not sure whether I can see any difference. If people would be happier with that tweak, it would not affect us. I am not now speaking as a representative of the Jewish community; I am just engaging in an interesting discussion. I cannot see a problem with that.\n\nRod Burns\n\nThere would be a few practical implications if people did not have any form of recognition while the bill came into force. For instance, let us consider a couple in a mixed-sex civil partnership in England, Wales or Northern Ireland—wherever it is—who come to Scotland, set up home, get on with their jobs and engage with life. Let us consider what would happen if one partner got pregnant and gave birth. If they did not have any civil status, the father would not have the parental rights that flow from being treated as being married. That is a key distinction.\n\nI take the point that people take the civil status of their civil partnerships very seriously—it touches on their personal identity. People are quite keen to keep us on the front foot and are almost punctilious in keeping us right on the terminology and language that we use as registrars, and they want the people who oversee legislation to treat them properly and respectfully. I absolutely take the point that people might not like being classified and treated as being married when they are not married and do not like all of that baggage. It is a real thing, not a cavil. To be treated as being married would impinge on people’s identities. However, if there was no protection in that interim period, fairly extraordinary measures would have to be taken to ensure that, for example, somebody could be treated as the father of a child, with all the legal responsibilities that flow from that. Treating somebody as married, albeit that that would be offensive to their identity, would mean that they would have a much less problematic route to receiving parental rights and responsibilities and all the social and legal benefits that would flow from that.\n\nIn practical terms, there are different forms of civil status. When people die, people have to serve as informants. There is a whole host of information and background data that we collect. Some of that goes on to register pages, and that is defined by one’s civil status.\n\nThe approach is probably not ideal in terms of people’s identities but, practically speaking, having some form of recognition is better than having no form of recognition. We deal with complicated cases every day—as do the registrars—that take a lot of delving into and untangling.\n\nFrom an administrative viewpoint, if no other, putting in place some recognition that forestalls those sorts of complexities can be only a good thing, and it would be temporary. Most reasonable people would probably say, “Well, I don’t like it, but I can see the benefits both to me and to the state more widely.”\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nI accept all of that. It is important that we have some recognition in the interim but, from an NRS perspective, can you see a legal impediment to changing that provision so that, in place of the word “marriage”, the words “civil partnership” are inserted? It is being treated as a civil partnership—an institution that exists already in this country—with all the trappings that you describe, albeit not for mixed-sex couples. From a legal perspective, can you see any problem in amending that?\n\nRod Burns\n\nI am not qualified to comment from a legal perspective. I feel a bit like one of Ephraim Borowski’s philosophy students. The only way that I can see that happening is if the bill had already been passed and we already recognised mixed-sex civil partnerships. My brain is falling apart trying to understand that.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nWe do not need to already recognise mixed-sex civil partnerships for that to work, because there is an institution called “civil partnership” that already confers all the parenting rights, pension stuff and everything else. The issue is incredibly important to people who do not wish to be seen as being in the institution of marriage or to be treated as if they were in a marriage. The nomenclature around that is incredibly important—as you say, it touches on people’s personal identities. We have been asked to change that; I just wonder whether we can.\n\nRod Burns\n\nI honestly do not know. Civil partnership is defined exclusively as for same-sex partners. That is the philosophical hurdle that I am trying to get over.\n\nFiona Blair\n\nYes.\n\nRod Burns\n\nI hope that, in your session with the minister and legal representatives next week, they can come up with some wizardry that will answer your question, because I cannot. I am sorry.\n\nThe Convener\n\nYou took the words right out of my mouth. We will explore those questions further with the Government. Is Alex Cole-Hamilton content for now?\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton\n\nI am.\n\nMary Fee (West Scotland) (Lab)\n\nMr Burns, you briefly touched on the issue of gender in one of your answers. In our evidence session last week, Professor Norrie suggested that the provisions regarding gender recognition are overly complex. Do members of the panel share that view? If not, why not; and if so, why?\n\nRod Burns\n\nI have not read Professor Norrie’s testimony in full. Could you give me a quick capsule of why he said they were overly complex?\n\nMary Fee\n\nProfessor Norrie said in his written submission—I will cover that first—that he questioned whether\n\n“the full implications have been worked out when one party to an existing civil partnership or marriage changes gender”.\n\nOne of his reasons for saying that it overly complicates things was that, in his view, the issue of gender recognition should be dealt with by amending the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and should not be brought into this bill. Currently, someone in a same-sex civil partnership who seeks to obtain a gender recognition certificate would need to end the civil partnership. If different-sex civil partnerships are introduced, a couple in a civil partnership in which one person seeks to change gender could continue that civil partnership if the other person agrees. Professor Norrie’s view was that things are being made more complicated than they need to be and that we need to consider amending the Gender Recognition Act 2004 at some point in the future, because that would be the appropriate legislation under which to do something about gender in relation to civil partnerships.\n\nRod Burns\n\nObviously, the Scottish Government is consulting on gender recognition reform and I know from my engagement with officials in the Scottish Government and other stakeholders that it is a ferociously complex area and far from uncontroversial. In NRS, we try to stay away from controversy if at all possible.\n\nThat returns me to our key purpose, which I mentioned at the beginning. We work closely with Scottish Government policy colleagues to serve as a springboard for some of the practical implications of a proposed policy avenue might be, so we think through what our processes are and how the policy could be fully worked out in relation to the information that we require and the data that goes on to forms. That spirals quite quickly into complex discussions.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, one of the key benefits of what is proposed—although I am not going to argue with Professor Norrie—is that it seems to be a limited proposal with fairly huge implications and benefits for an individual who wants to undergo gender recognition. That stood out to me personally.\n\n09:45\n\nAs I said, we deal with relatively small numbers of people—maybe 25 or 30 people a year in Scotland—who have gone through the gender recognition process and been awarded a full certificate. We receive a package with all the information from the UK panel and, in essence, set about putting their life on a new footing.\n\nIt is quite moving talking to people who have gone through that process. Not many people do it, but the impact on them is absolutely profound, and it touches very deeply on identity. So, my view—which is, of course, just my personal view—is that the benefit that could be gained from a relatively limited engagement on that aspect of the gender recognition issue would be quite profound. Obviously, the complexities of dealing with gender recognition in the round are enormous, not least in terms of NRS and the registrars. It has quite significant implications for additional workload and resources that we would need to put in place if we were to go down the route of having a self-certification process and pulling out of a tribunal context.\n\nMy view is that those things are so complicated that we probably do not have time to get into them now; that will happen in the future. However, I reiterate that it seems to me that, as things stand in Scotland, it is a relatively limited proposal, but it would have quite significant benefits personally for individuals.\n\nMary Fee\n\nIt is only fair to point out at this stage that a number of organisations welcome the approach that has been taken in relation to gender in the proposed legislation. Professor Norrie’s view was different to those of a number of organisations. Do any other panel members have a view on this issue?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nI echo what Rod Burns has said. Also, gender recognition would be dealt with at the NRS level and not at the registration level.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nFor us, it is about ensuring that the system allows a couple to remain in a relationship if they consent to that and want to do that. My understanding is that, if that is not in the legislation, those people would have to legally separate and then re-form their relationship in a legal sense. If both parties are accepting of their civil partnership continuing, I do not see why it is beneficial to stop that happening.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI do not think I would want to say anything on behalf of the Jewish community about this issue, because there will be diverse views about both gender recognition and civil partnership. The interface and interlocking of the two is going to produce so many different possible answers, that I could not possibly speak on that without doing an awful lot of homework.\n\nHowever, I think that there is a clear link between the points that Mary Fee and Alex Cole-Hamilton made. The status already exists, and therefore a sideways move is easier than dropping out and then coming back in—or going around two sides of the triangle rather than going straight across the base.\n\nThe Convener\n\nWe have had quite a bit of reflection on the status of marriage versus civil partnership, and the baggage—or whatever it is—that comes with it. To continue that a little further, what are the panel’s reflections on whether we should allow married couples to convert to civil partnerships? Do you have views on that?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nIf a civil partnership can be converted to a marriage, I think that that will be a question that the registrars are asked. I do not have a specific view on it. I note that the Scottish Government does not intend to provide for that as part of this bill but that it might consider the issue at a later date. I think it is something that we will be asked for.\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nSome couples who have come to us have decided that they wanted to proceed with a marriage because a civil partnership was not available to them. I do not know how they would feel about converting to a civil partnership many years down the line.\n\nIt seems odd that, if we change the law so that civil partnership is available to them but there is no conversion option, the only way for them to get that is to get divorced and then form a civil partnership. I do not think that that is a good idea, so I would support the transfer provisions. Couples have come to us and said that they wanted a civil partnership because of all the baggage. Some of them decided that they would not have any legal relationship, but some decided to enter into marriage because they wanted to have the legal protections. If the conversion option was not there, those people would miss out just because they got married five years ago.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI do not think that we have a view on the pros and cons, or that the provision would make much practical difference. I have done no consultation, so what I am about to say is doubly hypothetical, but if it were to be introduced, I do not think that any branch of the Jewish faith would ask people to divorce first before entering into a civil partnership. If they simply wanted to change their civil status, that would be up to them and would have no repercussions further down the line. The whole point of section 9 of the bill is to replicate what is already provided for divorce after a marriage, so it would make no difference from our point of view.\n\nRod Burns\n\nMy view is straightforward and pragmatic. If Parliament were to decide that marriages could be changed to civil partnerships, we would work with the Scottish Government to figure out ways to implement that. It is that simple. We do not have a principled policy view on it.\n\nMary Fee\n\nHas the panel any views on how popular different-sex civil partnerships may be? The Government’s preparatory work estimated that there could be between 100 and 150 and it has based its costs analysis on 109. The Equality Network has estimated that there could be 500 a year. If we base the figure on UK Government estimates, it could be higher, at between 2,000 and 8,000 a year.\n\nFiona Blair\n\nWhen same-sex marriage was introduced, civil partnerships dropped away to roughly 70 a year and marriages increased. Most people—not all—who had entered into same-sex civil partnerships wanted a marriage, with a formal ceremony akin to a marriage.\n\nWe would probably find that there would be a redress; people who had been cohabiting would enter into a civil partnership just for legal protection, so there would be a bit more civil partnership. As I said before, we have had 47 inquiries in 11 local authorities, so more people could choose that route. Whether the mixed-sex civil partnership would be a ceremonial route with a religious element, a simple register office process or a ceremony with a registrar, I cannot say what the difference would be in numbers, but I definitely think that people will choose that option.\n\nRod Burns\n\nFiona Blair is right; on the introduction of same-sex marriage, the figure went from 600 civil partnerships a year down to about 60 or 70, so there was a 90 per cent drop off. Most of those people took up same-sex marriage, but by that token, 50 or 60 on-going new civil partnerships could continue to be created every year. I suspect that there is a smaller but real demand for mixed-sex civil partnerships.\n\nA range from 100 to 8,000 is quite wide. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. A figure of 8,000 is unlikely but, even if we did see figures at the highest end, additional resources may be drawn down by registrars and by the NRS with regard to its oversight of the registration service. We would adopt the process into our normal business as usual. If we were looking at tens of thousands of cases, that would probably displace some of the resources that registrars have available to do marriages. Last year, there were 26,000 or 27,000 marriages, so the system already has knocking on for 30,000 civil unions. We have capacity to deal with quite a lot, but possibly not an additional 8,000. I had not heard that figure, and it seems quite large, certainly when compared with 100 to 150.\n\nMary Fee\n\nIt would be a massive increase. If the legislation is introduced, do you think that there will be a spike in the number of people who want that type of formal relationship, which might then drop off and stabilise?\n\nFiona Blair\n\nYes.\n\nRod Burns\n\nThat seems to be a fairly settled view, and certainly the experience of other countries suggests that there is pent-up demand, so there is a bump at the beginning and then it will taper off, on that model, to maybe a few hundred each year. From a registration system perspective, 200, 300 or 400 a year is eminently absorbable into our normal business.\n\nMary Fee\n\nDo other panel members have a view?\n\nFraser Sutherland\n\nI do not necessarily agree with Rod Burns’s last point, although I appreciate that it is based on what has happened elsewhere. If I draw a comparison with humanist marriage, in 2005, fewer than 100 people decided that that was the option that they wanted to take, and now the number is in the region of 5,000. The reason for the growth is that people have gone to humanist ceremonies and want to replicate them. There is a social growth element in that people see such a ceremony and then recognise it as an option for themselves. I do not know whether that is going to happen with civil partnerships; I am a humanist, so I do not believe in crystal balls telling me the future. I cannot tell you what is going to happen, but it happened with us for humanist marriage and it could happen with civil partnerships. As people start going to see civil partnership ceremonies, they might feel that they are much more reflective of the relationship that they want to form. That question is probably best asked of younger generations who are going to be entering into such relationships 10 or 20 years down the line. We can second guess what people today would do, but we do not know what the future might hold.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nI can link the point with something that Fraser Sutherland said earlier about marriage tourism. I do not see there being a huge uptake in the Jewish community in Scotland, but that leads me to correct something that I said at the beginning of the meeting. I was talking about couples in which one person comes from outside Scotland, but we should actually be thinking about couples in which both people come from outside Scotland. The main difference between Scottish marriage or civil partnership and English marriage or civil partnership is that we license individuals, which is why we have the relationship that we have with the NRS, whereas in England they license premises. Therefore, if a couple, for whatever reason, decide that they want to get married or have a civil partnership ceremony at the top of Ben Nevis, they can. Given that they probably cannot have a civil partnership back home, if they have emotional or philosophical reasons for wanting a civil partnership rather than a marriage, Scotland is a very nice place to do it, although not necessarily at his time of year.\n\nMary Fee\n\nNot at the top of Ben Nevis, no.\n\nEphraim Borowski\n\nIt may well be that small faith communities will actually see the marriage tourism that Fraser Sutherland talked about earlier.\n\nMary Fee\n\nThat is an interesting point, thank you.\n\nThe Convener\n\nThank you for your interesting evidence, which has been very helpful. We will now suspend briefly.\n\n09:58 Meeting suspended.\n\n10:02 On resuming—\n\nThe Convener\n\nWelcome to our second panel of the day. I welcome Tim Hopkins, director of the Equality Network; Kenny Stewart, head of policy at the Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland; and Elena Soper, programmes co-ordinator at YWCA Scotland—The Young Women’s Movement.\n\nCan you tell us about your organisations, whether you support the general principles of the bill and what implications—if any—it will have for your organisations?\n\nElena Soper (YWCA Scotland – The Young Women’s Movement)\n\nWe support the bill. We are a feminist organisation and we run empowerment programmes for women of all ages through our national work, which is based in Edinburgh, and through community outreach work in Glasgow. We do not foresee any issues if the bill is enacted.\n\nKenny Stewart (Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland)\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission is Great Britain’s equality body and one of the UK’s three national human rights organisations. Our job is to help to make Scotland, England and Wales fairer, which we do by safeguarding and enforcing the laws that protect people’s rights to fairness, dignity and respect. We support the aims of the bill on the basis that it advances equality of opportunity for mixed-sex couples.\n\nTim Hopkins (Equality Network)\n\nThe Equality Network is a national lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex equality organisation in Scotland. All our policy work is based on consulting LGBTI people across Scotland. We first did that about partnership recognition in 2000 and 2001 and, even back then, people were saying to us the same things as they are saying now. A lot of LGBT people said that the only thing that is true equality is equal marriage and they wanted to be able to marry, but a significant minority said that marriage is not for them, but that they would like to be able to do something else to register a partnership—civil partnership did not exist in this country in those days. Our policy since 2001 has been that civil partnerships should be introduced and should be available to all couples regardless of gender—and that marriage should be equalised.\n\nIt has taken quite a while to get to this point. Marriage was equalised five or six years ago. We consider the bill to be unfinished business from the equalisation of marriage. We very much welcome it. The bill is well drafted. We have one suggestion to add something to the bill, but I will say more about that later.\n\nAlison Harris\n\nWhat are your views about the legal and social differences between marriages and civil partnerships?\n\nTim Hopkins\n\nAs the committee has heard from other witnesses, the legal differences between marriage and civil partnership are very small. It was mentioned earlier that adultery is one of the ways to prove the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage, but not a civil partnership. I can say some more about that later. There are some other very small differences. A marriage is voidable—meaning it can be annulled—on the ground of the permanent and incurable impotency of one person. That does not apply to civil partnership. The Scottish Government describes that rule as “antiquated” in the policy memorandum to the bill. The legal differences are tiny.\n\nThe important thing is not legal difference but cultural difference and social meanings and personal meaning to the couple and their family. The whole reason why we supported equal marriage was that, although people could already get the legal rights through civil partnership, that is not the same as marriage: marriage has meanings for people that civil partnership does not. For many people, marriage is seen as the gold standard. That is why it was so important that marriage should be available to same-sex couples.\n\nHowever, not everyone sees it that way. For some people, as the committee has already heard, marriage is not what they want, for all sorts of reasons. However, they want the opportunity to enter something like a civil partnership, because the social meanings are different and because it means something different to them and their family. The differences are not about the law—they are wider than that. That is why the bill is so welcome.\n\nElena Soper\n\nFrom a feminist woman’s perspective, for some people—women in particular—marriage can be seen as being rooted in patriarchal and outdated ideals and closely bound to religious processes. Despite the evolution of marriage towards something more equal and the fact that it is not the same as it was historically—it was only 30 years ago that rape was made illegal in marriage; that is still within living memory—the anachronisms are still evident. For example, if we think about a traditional wedding ceremony, the bride is still given away by her father to the groom. Civil partnerships provide an alternative that can be seen as a more equal commitment and less encumbered by traditional and societal expectations of women in their role as a wife.\n\nKenny Stewart\n\nI do not have a lot to add to those answers. Civil partnership is another route to the very similar legal protections that are provided by marriage. We absolutely understand why some couples may prefer that route, for the reasons that other witnesses have outlined.\n\nMaurice Golden\n\nThis question is for Tim Hopkins and anyone else who wants to chip in. Can you elaborate on your earlier point on the difference between the break-up of a marriage and the dissolution of a civil partnership? What are your thoughts on that?\n\nTim Hopkins\n\nThe basic ground on which to get a divorce or dissolve a civil partnership is irretrievable breakdown of the relationship. The law says that that can be demonstrated or proved in several different ways. The principal way to prove it is by ending cohabitation: non-cohabitation for two years is a ground for divorce, even if one partner does not want the divorce, and non-cohabitation for one year is enough for divorce if both partners agree to the divorce. The other ground is what is often called unreasonable behaviour, where one partner behaves in such a way that the other partner cannot reasonably be expected to continue to cohabit with them. An obvious example of that would be domestic abuse.\n\nFor marriage, but not for civil partnership, the other way to prove irretrievable breakdown is through adultery. However, adultery has a very narrow definition. Adultery means sexual intercourse between a man and a woman where one of them is in the marriage and the other is not. Other forms of sexual infidelity are not adultery. If the husband in a mixed-sex marriage engages in other sexual activity with another woman—oral sex for example—that is not adultery. His wife could still get a divo"
