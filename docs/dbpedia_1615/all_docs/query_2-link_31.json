        "text": "Elegant small country house\n\nSuperb barn conversion providing entertaining space\n\nAccessible rural location.\n\n3 reception rooms. 5 bedrooms. Study.\n\nPaddock\n\n3.85 acres\n\nSITUATION Sitting north west of Dumfries in a delightful rural location, The Clachan is approximately 4 miles from the Fairtrade village of Dunscore, which has a strong sense of community with amenities including a community run pub, medical practice, Post Office service (run part time in the community hall), church and primary school with secondary schooling provided in Thornhill at the Wallace Hall Academy. Dumfries is the regional capital with an extensive range of amenities typical of a town of this size including high street shops, retail parks, supermarkets, primary and secondary schools, parks and leisure facilities, golf clubs, cricket club, rugby club, and the famous Queen of the South football club. There is a major hospital on the edge of the town, Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary. The Crichton Campus is home to Dumfries & Galloway College, and the southern campuses of the University of Glasgow and the University of the West of Scotland. Dumfries railway station connects with Glasgow, Edinburgh and Carlisle. There is a mainline station at Lockerbie, around 15 miles north east, with connections to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham and London. Domestic and international flights are available from Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, both around 80 miles distant.DESCRIPTION Historically, The Clachan was the gardener’s cottage which served Newtonairds House. It has been thoughtfully extended over the years to form the compact elegant country house it is today. The current owners have converted the large barn to form a highly useful and attractive games and entertainment barn. The spacious reception rooms comprise a welcoming Sitting Room, elegant Drawing Room with French doors to the garden, and a Dining Room, with French doors to the courtyard. The Kitchen is the heart of the home, with both Aga and range cooker, as well as larder and pantry. A very large utility room provides excellent space for laundry facilities.The Master Suite on the ground floor is a private area of bathroom, bedroom and dressing room. Bedroom 2 provides the main guest room, and is situated next to the main bathroom. A useful study sits next to the Master Suite. Upstairs are two further bedrooms and a box room, with a bathroom completing the main internal accommodation. Accessed from outside is the current owner’s workroom, which is plumbed for a kitchen, and has bathroom facilities. Also accessed from here is the large attic space which has conversion potential, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. ACCOMMODATION Ground Floor: Entrance vestibule. Entrance Hall. W.C.

Storeroom, BathroomGARDEN AND GROUNDSThe garden grounds are mainly laid to lawn, with a variety of mature shrubs and trees surrounding. There is a large patio adjacent to the kitchen. Raised beds and a greenhouse provide scope for the keen gardener to grow their own produce. The barn has a further area of lawn, again with mature trees and shrubs surrounding. The drive way leads to a parking area in front of the house and barn. A derelict former outbuilding provides scope for development subject to obtaining all necessary consents. Two log stores could potentially be used as stables, as well as the current timber stable. A garden shed completes the outbuildings.Entertainment BarnThe former stone barn has been comprehensively refurbished to provide comfortable entertainment space, akin to country house living. There is a workshop, games room and billiard room with seating area and log burning stove.Timber Stable – 4.27 m x 3.66mLandThe land comprises a grazing paddock suitable for equestrian use.AccessThe driveway track leading from the public road to the property belongs to the property. The property further up, known as Nirvana, and the local farmer have a right of access each to use the track. For the avoidance of doubt, they are not obligated to share the maintenance of the track."
