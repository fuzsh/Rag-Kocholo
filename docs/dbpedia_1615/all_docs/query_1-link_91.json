        "text": "Scottish Premiership Football has just kicked off for another season.\n\nEyes from across the world will be firmly locked on the two giant Glaswegian clubs, Celtic and Rangers.\n\nHowever, many people are quick to judge the level of talent in Scotland, with there being a multitude of talent across the top divisions.\n\nLast season, the Scottish Championship saw some significant big names competing in the second tier.\n\nBig clubs such as Dundee United and Partick Thistle fought for promotion, while former internationals Aiden McGeady and Tony Watt plied their trade in the division, too.\n\nSome of Scotlandâ€™s biggest clubs have recognised this level of quality, loaning out some of their prized prospects last season to the Scottish Championship.\n\nIn this tactical analysis and Scottish Premiership scout report, we will provide an in-depth analysis of three players who spent time on loan in the Scottish Championship last season.\n\nThis analysis will highlight where the players excelled while on loan within their loan sideâ€™s tactics and what they must improve if they wish to claim a starting spot at their parent club.\n\nKanayo Megwa (Airdrieonians: On Loan From Hibernian)\n\nKanayo Megwa, born and raised in London, signed for Hibernian in 2021.\n\nThe 20-year-old had spent time at EFL Championship clubs such as Watford and West Brom before making the move north of the border.\n\nAfter a successful loan spell in Scottish League 1 with Kelty Hearts, Megwa was loaned out to Airdrieonians for the 2023/24 season.\n\nHis performances for the North Lanarkshire club have certainly caught many peopleâ€™s attention.\n\nMegwa can be utilised in several positions.\n\nDepending on Airdrieoniansâ€™ formation, Megwa played as either a right-back or a right wing-back.\n\nHe also proved his versatility by filling in as a right centre-back in a back three and left-back on several occasions.\n\nAs seen by Megwaâ€™s heatmap, he didnâ€™t need an invitation to get forward.\n\nMegwa was constantly bombing forward with and without the ball.\n\nOften, he could be found making advancing runs for players to pick him out with long passes.\n\nWhen in possession, he could be found driving past opponents with the ball.\n\nIn this example, Megwa picks up the ball after making a run forward.\n\nHe quickly drives at the oppositionâ€™s full-back, using his pace to beat his opponent.\n\nAfter creating a yard of space, he delivers an excellent ball into the box for his teammates to attack.\n\nMegwa was evidently one of the standout performers when it came to beating players in the Scottish Championship last season.\n\nHe averaged 3.23 dribbles per 90 seconds with a success rate of 63.7%, the fourth highest in the division.\n\nWhen compared with right-backs in the Scottish Championship, he had a percentile rank of 84.9 for dribbles per 90 seconds.\n\nOnce Megwa got into these advanced positions, his crossing was of a decent standard.\n\nStatistically, he averaged 2.7 crosses per 90 with a 40% accuracy, the 11th highest in the league.\n\nHowever, Megwaâ€™s productivity from crosses was low.\n\nHe finished the season with only one assist and had an expected assists tally of 3.06.\n\nHe had a percentile rank of only 46.53 for dangerous passes per 90 when compared with other right-backs in the Scottish Championship last season.\n\nIn this situation, we see Megwa using his speed and 1v1 attacking ability to great effect.\n\nHe bursts past the oppositionâ€™s full-back with great ease, allowing him to get to the byline and deliver a cross.\n\nHowever, he misses the ball, slicing the cross, leading to the ball going out for a goal kick.\n\nMegwa has proven that not only does he possess quality in possession, but he also has many qualities when defending.\n\nHe uses his blistering pace and exceptional agility when pressing to help him win the ball back from his opponents.\n\nMegwa demonstrated this most successfully during the defensive transition.\n\nThis graphic demonstrates the significant number of counter-pressing recoveries Megwa made in the opponentâ€™s half.\n\nThis becomes even more impressive when you consider Megwa made only 27.1% of his recoveries in the oppositionâ€™s half.\n\nMegwaâ€™s ability when pressing and defending 1v1 can also be seen in the fact he won 60.9% of defensive duels.\n\nYet this isnâ€™t his only strength when defending.\n\nMegwa has shown through using both his athleticism and intelligence to be highly effective at making interceptions.\n\nHere, Megwa sees an opportunity to win the ball.\n\nHe reads the oppositionâ€™s midfielderâ€™s first-time pass to the left-winger.\n\nMegwa uses his athleticism to step in and win the ball.\n\nHe is then quick to drive forward and start a dangerous counterattack.\n\nBreaking into one of Scotlandâ€™s most established clubs will be a tall order for Megwa.\n\nInternationals Chris Caden and Lewis Miller are Hibsâ€™ current options for right-back.\n\nMegwa may need to secure a loan move to a club in the Scottish Premiership or EFL League 2 to provide an opportunity for him to develop his ability to play for the Edinburgh club.\n\nHe has, however, put in performances that will attract many clubs, whether that is for a loan move or a permanent departure from Easter Road.\n\nLewis Neilson (Partick Thistle: On Loan From Heart Of Midlothian)\n\nHeart of Midlothian FC have also seen value in using the Scottish Championship to provide a platform for their young talent to develop.\n\nLewis Neilson, 21, was loaned to Partick Thistle last season and played a vital role in the Glasgow clubâ€™s securing a spot in the playoffs.\n\nA product of the Dundee United youth academy, the Scotland u21 international moved to Hearts in 2022.\n\nAfter making 10 first-team appearances for the Jambons, he was loaned out to Partick Thistle to get much-needed consistent first-team football to allow him to progress.\n\nNeilson played in two positions throughout the season.\n\nHe began the season playing in his natural position of centre-back.\n\nHowever, injuries resulted in a change of personnel, and Neilson was used as a number 6.\n\nAs seen from Neilsonâ€™s heat map, he played the majority of his minutes at centre-back on the left-hand side of the pitch.\n\nItâ€™s also clear that he spent a significant amount of time positioning himself in front of the defence, fulfilling his role as a number 6.\n\nIn possession, Neilson undoubtedly has the ability to progress play.\n\nHe averaged 15.05 forward passes per 90 with an accuracy rate of 71.1%.\n\nHe was able to play many passes into the feet of his midfielders, yet he often elected to play long diagonal passes to his teammates.\n\nAs seen here, Neilson has the ball deep in his own half.\n\nNone of the oppositionâ€™s forwards choose to aggressively press the centre-back.\n\nNeilson takes advantage of this and plays an outstanding long ball over the top of the oppositionâ€™s defence for the run of his centre-forward.\n\nNeilson averaged 6.3 long passes per 90.\n\nHe had an accuracy of 52.8%, highlighting the fact that despite his quality when playing long balls, many were intercepted.\n\nHe had a percentile rank of only 33 for accurate passes when compared to other centre-backs in the Scottish Championship.\n\nHere, playing as the deepest midfielder, Neilson seeks to find the left-winger.\n\nHe plays a long diagonal ball, hoping to find the feet of his teammate.\n\nHowever, the oppositionâ€™s right-back has a great starting position, allowing him to intercept Neilsonâ€™s attempt at playing forward.\n\nWhere Neilson really stands out is his ability to defend.\n\nLast season, Neilson had the fourth-most defensive duels in the Scottish Championship, with an impressive success rate of 73.9%.\n\nNeilson thrived in a variety of 1v1s.\n\nHe excelled when he was dragged out wide and often dominated centre-forwards when they had their backs to him.\n\nIn this situation, Neilson remains tight to his direct opponent.\n\nHis aggressive nature and physicality led to his opponent losing control of the ball.\n\nHe then quickly steps in front of the forward and aggressively wins a 50/50 tackle against a challenging opponent.\n\nNeilson had a percentile rank of 82.6 for percentage of defensive duels won per 90 when compared with other centre-backs.\n\nNeilson caught the attention of many for his performances while on loan at Partick Thistle.\n\nHearts have recognised this and shown how much they value him by rewarding him with a new contract, extending his deal until June 2026.\n\nHearts have sent Neilson out on loan to Scottish Premiership club St.\n\nJohnstone who will allow Neilson to prove his worth in Scotlandâ€™s top flight.\n\nAnother successful year on loan could see Neilson state a claim for becoming a valued member of the Hearts squad.\n\nSam McClelland (Dundee United: On Loan From St.\n\nJohnstone)\n\nSam McClelland had a mixed year in his first season playing in Scotland.\n\nMcClelland came through Coleraineâ€™s youth academy before making the move to Chelsea, where he continued his development.\n\nAfter a loan period at EFL League 2 side Barrow, McClelland was released by Chelsea and snapped up by St.\n\nJohnstone in August 2023.\n\nThe Northern Ireland u21 International only managed to make seven first-team appearances for St.\n\nJohnston in the first half of the season.\n\nMcClelland was made available for loan to help him get more first-team minutes under his belt.\n\nIn February, he moved to Dundee United, where he played a crucial role in helping the Tangerines secure the Championship title and promotion back to Scotlandâ€™s top flight.\n\nDespite only playing a handful of games, McClellandâ€™s quality was clear for everyone to see upon his arrival at Dundee.\n\nMcClelland operated as a right centre-back in Dundeeâ€™s 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nIn possession, McClelland was never afraid to ask for the ball.\n\nHe would constantly move and offer excellent supporting angles from under the ball.\n\nThis helped provide his teammates with an option under pressure, allowing possession to be recycled.\n\nHere, Dundee United look to play the ball out from the back.\n\nThe opposition have pressed aggressively hoping to win the ball back in a dangerous area of the pitch.\n\nHere, McClelland sees that his team is under pressure and offers a great supporting angle for his teammates, allowing pressure to be relieved.\n\nPlaying in a team that dominated the ball allowed McClelland to show his quality in possession.\n\nThe numbers clearly show this.\n\nMcClelland averaged 17.11 forward passes per 90 and 6.25 passes per 90 into the oppositionâ€™s final third with an accuracy of 71.1%.\n\nWhere McClelland shone was his ability to play long balls forward.\n\nHe averages 8.72 long balls per 90 with an accuracy of 62.3 %, the third highest in the league by an outfield player.\n\nIn this situation, McClelland has the ball in his own half.\n\nUnder pressure, he looks forward to finding a teammate.\n\nHe plays an excellent long pass into the feet of his centre-forward, allowing his team to progress up the pitch.\n\nDefensively, McClelland showed a lot of quality.\n\nHe displayed a really aggressive nature when battling against the oppositionâ€™s centre-forwards.\n\nOften, he would step in front of strikers, using his strength to physically outmuscle his opponents to win the ball.\n\nHere, McClelland gets out quickly to the advancing forward.\n\nHe ensures to jockey his opponent, not diving in, so his opponent doesnâ€™t have a chance to go by him.\n\nThis allows his teammates to track back and help win possession back.\n\nHis quality is displayed by McClelland winning 75.6% of his defensive duels â€” the ninth-highest in the league.\n\nDespite this quality and his height/physical stature, McClelland does show some inconsistency when defending aerially â€” he only won 51.6% of his aerial duels.\n\nIn this scenario, the ball has been crossed into the box.\n\nMcClelland has done an excellent job of getting close to the oppositionâ€™s centre-forward.\n\nHowever, as the ball is crossed, he fails to get off the ground and is beaten easily in the air, allowing the centre-forward to get a shot off on goal.\n\nMcClelland had a percentile rank of only 27.6 for aerial duels win percentage per 90 when he was compared with other centre-backs in the Scottish Championship.\n\nMcClelland will hope to cement himself in the Scottish Premiership this season with St.\n\nJohnstone.\n\nHe will face competition from a host of centre-backs, including Lewis Neilson and new signing Kyle Cameron, and he will need to perform consistently to remain in the team.\n\nThrough his short spell at Dundee, McClelland has proven he is above the Scottish Championship level.\n\nA move to EFL League 1 or 2 may be on the cards if McClelland fails to break into St.\n\nJohnstoneâ€™s side.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis Scottish Premiership analysis shows the quality of talent that is at the disposal of Scotlandâ€™s top sides.\n\nYet as our Scottish Championship scout report has shown, the 2nd tier has also proven a quality breeding ground for Scottish talent to develop.\n\nEach player proved through their stints in Scotlandâ€™s second tier that they have the potential to play at a higher level and have become a more accomplished player as a result of their time on loan.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the 2024/25 Scottish Premiership season develops."
