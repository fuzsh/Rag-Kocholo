        "text": "The Scottish Football League (\"SFL\") was established in 1890, initially as an amateur league as professionalism had not been legalised in Scottish football.[1] In 1893 a Second Division was formed, with the existing single division renamed the First Division. The Second Division was discontinued during the First World War but revived in 1921.[2] A Third Division was added in 1923 but collapsed three years later as a number of its member clubs found themselves unable to complete their fixtures for financial reasons, with many folding altogether. After the Second World War the divisions were rebranded as Division A and Division B and a Division C was added. This included a mixture of new member clubs and the reserve teams of clubs from the higher divisions, but this division was dropped in 1955.[3]\n\nA major re-organisation of the SFL in 1975 led to the existing two divisions being split into three smaller divisions, with a new Premier Division at the highest level. This structure remained in place until 1998, when the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the Scottish Premier League, which supplanted the Premier Division as the highest level of football in Scotland.[4] In 2013 the two leagues merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, ending the 123-year existence of the SFL.\n\nFor the whole history of the SFL, there was no mechanism in place for club(s) at the bottom of the league to be relegated.[5] A number of clubs who resigned or were expelled from the SFL went on to play in non-league football, either in senior leagues such as the East of Scotland Football League or in leagues governed by the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA).[6][7] Whenever a club left the league (for example, when Gretna was liquidated in 2008), a new club was elected in its place.[8] This closed-shop system was changed soon after the leagues merged, when a play-off between the bottom-placed SPFL club and the winner of a play-off between the Highland League and Lowland League champions was introduced in 2015. Edinburgh City became the first club to be promoted to the SPFL when they won a playoff against East Stirlingshire in 2016.[9]\n\nClubs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe tables show the first and last seasons in which each club competed in the league. Some clubs' membership was intermittent between their first and last seasons. Clubs shown in bold were among the founder members of the league. Where a former club has become defunct, any phoenix club formed as a successor side is noted.\n\nFormer member clubs currently playing in the SPFL\n\n[edit]\n\nClub First SFL\n\nseason Last SFL\n\nseason Notes Aberdeen 1904–05 1997–98 [10] Airdrieonians[note 1] 2002–03 2012–13 [11] Albion Rovers 1903–04 2012–13 [12] Alloa Athletic 1921–22 2012–13 [13] Annan Athletic 2008–09 2012–13 [14] Arbroath 1921–22 2012–13 [15] Ayr United 1910–11 2012–13 [16] Celtic 1890–91 1997–98 [17] Clyde 1891–92 2012–13 [18] Cowdenbeath 1905–06 2012–13 [19] Dumbarton 1890–91 2012–13 [20] Dundee 1893–94 2011–12 [21] Dundee United 1910–11 1997–98 [22] Dunfermline Athletic 1912–13 2012–13 [23] East Fife 1921–22 2012–13 [24] Elgin City 2000–01 2012–13 [25] Falkirk 1902–03 2012–13 [26] Forfar Athletic 1921–22 2012–13 [27] Hamilton Academical 1897–98 2012–13 [28] Heart of Midlothian 1890–91 1997–98 [29] Hibernian 1893–94 1998–99 [30] Inverness Caledonian Thistle 1994–95 2009–10 [31] Kilmarnock 1895–96 1997–98 [32] Livingston 1995–96 2012–13 [33] Montrose 1923–24 2012–13 [34] Morton 1893–94 2012–13 [35] Motherwell 1893–94 1997–98 [36] Partick Thistle 1893–94 2012–13 [37] Peterhead 2000–01 2012–13 [38] Queen of the South 1923–24 2012–13 [39] Queen's Park 1900–01 2012–13 [40] Raith Rovers 1902–03 2012–13 [41] Rangers 1890–91 2012–13 [42] Ross County 1994–95 2011–12 [43] St Johnstone 1897–98 2008–09 [44] St Mirren 1890–91 2005–06 [45] Stenhousemuir 1921–22 2012–13 [46] Stirling Albion 1946–47 2012–13 [47] Stranraer 1949–50 2012–13 [48]\n\nOther former member clubs\n\n[edit]\n\nClub First SFL\n\nseason Last SFL\n\nseason Current status Notes Abercorn 1890–91 1914–15 Defunct effectively from 1920 due to being unable to secure a new ground, officially in 1922 (an annual club dinner however was held until 1939).
