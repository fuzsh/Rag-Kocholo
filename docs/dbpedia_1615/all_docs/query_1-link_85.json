        "text": "New research has revealed that more than one in three working Scottish parents would consider term-time only working to improve their work/life balance.\n\nA YouGov poll commissioned by Amazon found that half (51%) of working parents in Scotland want more flexibility in their jobs, while more than one in three (34%) parents in Scotland said they would consider switching to a term-time contract.\n\nHowever, almost half (44%) of those questioned in Scotland said their current employer offers no opportunity to work flexibly at all.\n\nThe survey also showed that three quarters (74%) of working parents in Scotland think flexible working is a priority when thinking about their next job.\n\nA better work-life balance (63%) and less commuting (53%) are the top perceived benefits of flexibility for working parents in Scotland.\n\nJohn Boumphrey, Amazon’s UK country manager, said: “These findings clearly demonstrate the huge importance of workplace flexibility, and why it matters so much to employees in Scotland and across the UK.”\n\nSeparately, the company has announced that its Amazon Innovation Accelerator is coming to Fife on 20 August and 23 September.\n\nNow in its second year, the programme provides small businesses with free training on how to grow.\n\nHosted at the Amazon fulfilment centre just outside Dunfermline, the accelerator also gives a peek-behind-the-curtain of how the e-commerce giant has scaled its own operations in the UK.\n\nTwo days of in-person workshops will be delivered by senior Amazon leaders, along with site tours and a virtual masterclass on innovation.\n\n“Our aim with the Amazon Innovation Accelerator is to support UK businesses to grow and create a culture of innovation within their own organisations,” said Amazon’s UK regional director Neil Travis. “We received overwhelmingly positive feedback from a pilot last year, and are excited to be expanding the activity this year to six locations across the UK, driving growth in businesses from Fife and further afield.”\n\nStephen Percy-Robb, chief executive at the Fife Chamber of Commerce, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for SMEs to gain invaluable insights and practical training from a global leader in innovation.\n\n“The free workshops, site tours, and virtual masterclass will equip Fife businesses with the tools and strategies they need to grow and thrive in today's competitive market.”\n\nSmall businesses operating in the manufacturing, engineering, logistics, retail or related industries and generating a turnover of at least £250,000 are eligible to apply for participation in the accelerator.\n\nSpaces are limited and applications close 10 August."
