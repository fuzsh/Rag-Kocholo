        "text": "Anderson History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nDenmark\n\nGermany\n\nScotland\n\nSweden\n\nIreland\n\nEngland\n\nOn the Scottish west coast, the Anderson family was born among the ancient Dalriadan clans. Their name comes from the given name Andrew. The given name Andrew is derived from the Greek name Andreas, which means man or manly. The first reference to the given name Andrew was a monk of Dunfermline, who later became the Bishop of Caithness in the reign of David I. The first references to the surname appeared in the 13th century. In 1296, David le fiz Andreu was recorded as a burgess of Peebles, and Duncan fiz Andreu of Dumfries was recorded as taking an oath of fealty. 1\n\nThe Andersons held territories in Moidart, but later moved to Badenoch in the early 14th century. The most prominent branches of the Andersons were the Dowhills, West Ardbrecks and Candacraigs in Strathdon.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Anderson family\n\nThe surname Anderson was first found in the Great Glen and Strathspey, where the Anderson family is descended from Mac Ghille Andreis, servant of St. Andrew, Scotland's Patron Saint. They are regarded as a sept of Clan Chattan and have been associated with this Confederation of Clans from the 15th century.\n\nNot withstanding the aforementioned Scottish ancestry, it should now be mentioned that some of the family moved south into England at early times in their history. By example, we need to mention the manor in the parish of Eyworth in Bedfordshire. \"The manor belonged at an early period to the Leybourns, and was afterwards in the families of Charlton and Francis; in the reign of Elizabeth, Eyworth was the property and seat of Sir Edmund Anderson, lord chief justice of the common pleas, one of the judges who sat at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. The church contains some interesting monuments to the Andersons and others.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Anderson family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Anderson research. Another 65 words (5 lines of text) covering the years 1300, 1515, 1620, 1668, 1710, 1721, 1726, 1796 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Anderson History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnderson Spelling Variations\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the translation between Gaelic and English was not a highly developed process. Spelling was not yet standardized, and so, an enormous number of spelling variations appear in records of early Scottish names. Anderson has appeared as Anderson, Andison, Andersonne, Andersoun, Andirsoone, Andresoun, Androson, Andirston, Andrewson and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Anderson family\n\nNotable amongst the Clan from early times was\n\nDavid and Alexander Anderson of Finshaugh, who made great contributions in the world of mathematics\n\nLionel Albert Anderson (c. 1620-1710), an English Dominican and Recusant who involved in the Titus Oates plot\n\nJohn Anderson (1668?-1721), a Scottish theologian and controversialist\n\nJohn HD Anderson (1726-1796), a Scottish professor who founded Anderson's College in Glasgow\n\nAnderson World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Anderson is the 11st most popular surname with an estimated 773,457 people with that name. 3 However, in Canada, the name Anderson is ranked the 13rd most popular surname with an estimated 70,365 people with that name. 4 And in Quebec, Canada, the name Anderson is the 745th popular surname. 5 Newfoundland, Canada ranks Anderson as 123rd with 294 people. 6 France ranks Anderson as 4,892nd with 1,500 - 2,000 people. 7 Australia ranks Anderson as 7th with 71,588 people. 8 New Zealand ranks Anderson as 8th with 6,986 people. 9 The United Kingdom ranks Anderson as 43rd with 88,023 people. 10 South Africa ranks Anderson as 524th with 13,549 people. 11\n\nMigration of the Anderson family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Anderson family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 78 words (6 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnderson migration to the United States +\n\nThese settlers arrived in North America at a time when the east was burgeoning with prosperous colonies and the expanses of the west were just being opened up. The American War of Independence was also imminent. Some Scots stayed to fight for a new country, while others who remained loyal went north as United Empire Loyalists. The ancestors of all of them went on to rediscover their heritage in the 20th century through highland games and other patriotic Scottish events. The Anderson were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records:\n\nAnderson Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nJochem Anderson, who arrived in New York, NY in 1600 12\n\nHeinrich Anderson, who immigrated to Philadelphia in 1627\n\nThomas Anderson, aged 28, who arriving first in St. Domingo then to Virginia in 1634 or 1635 aboard the ship \"Bonaventure\"\n\nJohn Anderson, aged 20, who arriving first in St. Domingo then to Virginia in 1634 or 1635 aboard the ship \"Bonaventure\" 12\n\nMr. Richard Anderson, aged 17, who arrived in Virginia in 1635 aboard the ship \"Transport\" 13\n\n...

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 25\n\nAnderson Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJames Anderson, aged 19, who arrived in Barbados in 1634 aboard the ship \"Hopewell\" 12\n\nMr. Robert Anderson, (b. 1613), aged 22, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Anne and Elizabeth\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 26\n\nMr. John Anderson, (b. 1614), aged 21, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Alexander\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 27\n\nMr. William Anderson, (b. 1599), aged 36, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Alexander\" arriving in Barbados in 1635 27\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Anderson (post 1700) +\n\nMarian Anderson (1897-1993), American concert and opera singer and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nJohn Anderson GCB, OM, GCSI, GCIE, PC, PC (Ire), FRS (1882-1958), 1st Viscount Waverley, British civil servant and politician, Chancellor of the Exchequer (1943-1945), Lord President of the Council (1940-1943), eponym of the Anderson Shelter used extensively in World War II\n\nPhilip Warren Anderson (1923-2020), American scientist who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1977 for his work on the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems\n\nJohn Anderson (1931-2024), Scottish television personality and sports coach, referee and official trainer on the UK television show Gladiators\n\nRona Anderson (1926-2013), Scottish stage, film, and television actress, best known for her roles in Scrooge (1951) and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969)\n\nWilliam Anderson (1750-1778), Scottish naturalist who accompanied James Cook on his second voyage aboard the Resolution in 1771 as surgeon's mate\n\nPatrick Anderson (b. 1979), Canadian-born American wheelchair basketball player, three-time Paralympics gold medalist\n\nLola Anderson (b. 1998), British world champion and Olympic gold medal-winner in rowing\n\nNorman Bruce Anderson (1955-2024), American scientist who was a tenured professor studying health disparities and mind/body health, and later an executive in government, non-profit, university sectors\n\nErich Anderson (b. 2024), born Edward Eric Anderson, sometimes credited as E.
