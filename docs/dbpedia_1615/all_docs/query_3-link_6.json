        "text": "Product categories are embedded in larger category systems. Within these systems, categories are organized vertically in a “‘stem and branch’ type hierarchy” (Wry and Lounsbury, 2013: 120) in which higher-level, umbrella categories (Kuilman and Li, 2009) nest lower-level product categories. This nesting of categories is important, as meaning can flow from umbrella categories to the product categories below (Durand and Boulongne, 2017). For instance, shifting the position of a product category nested under one umbrella category to another can profoundly affect the meaning of that lower-level category, as in the case of certain traditional Indian art whose meaning was transformed when art critics nested it under the “modern art” umbrella category (Khaire and Wadhwani, 2010). The emergence of a new umbrella category can potentially have an even more profound effect on the categorical landscape, as it “deliberately involves [re]positioning certain entities or goods that were previously disparate” in a way that imparts new “value potential” to those products (Durand and Khaire, 2017: 96).\n\nWhile extant organizational research has shed much light on the construction of new categories, for the most part it has focused on the product categories that reside at the lowest levels of the category structure rather than on higher-level umbrella categories. New product categories are said to arise when a group of “products or services are perceived to be of the same type or close substitutes for each other in satisfying market demand” (Navis and Glynn, 2010: 440). As entrepreneurs develop novel products, their audiences may apprehend distinctive attributes or features that come to define a category prototype against which category membership is then assessed (Pólos, Hannan, and Carroll, 2002; Vergne and Wry, 2014). Entrepreneurs may further the perception that a group of objects constitutes a new category by defining and rendering salient the attributes that distinguish the nascent category from incumbents (Kennedy, 2008; Santos and Eisenhardt, 2009). Entrepreneurs do so by “emphasizing similarities across the firms that claim membership to the category,” often in opposition to incumbent peer categories (Navis and Glynn, 2010: 442). The imagery is one of creating sharp distinctions between emergent and existing categories based on product attributes (Wry and Lounsbury, 2013; Grodal, Gotsopoulos, and Suarez, 2015), a process that is often assumed to involve a “division of labor” (Grodal, 2018: 785) whereby producers claim membership to categories and their audiences evaluate these claims.\n\nThere is some indication, however, that the construction of new umbrella categories may differ significantly from the process described above. Whereas the prototypical view that dominates organizational theory emphasizes similarity via shared attributes, umbrella categories may subsume under the same umbrella products that ostensibly share few attributes. For example, the umbrella category of “transportation” encompasses distinct modes of transport such as planes, trains, and automobiles that share few common attributes (Loken and Ward, 1990). Moreover, Durand and Khaire (2017) suggested that the reordering of the categorical landscape may be of less interest to entrepreneurs and more so to actors further removed from production, and it may follow very different category construction processes. 1 The latter set of actors may, in fact, prefer more ambiguous categories, in contrast to the sharply defined categories sought by entrepreneurs (Pontikes, 2012). Instead of assessing membership using category prototypes, these actors may make use of ideals whereby “category members are items that most suit an ideal, even if they greatly differ from each other—category structure is driven more by goal pursuit than by family resemblance” (Durand and Paolella, 2013: 1109). Termed “goal-derived categories” (Barsalou, 1985; Barsalou and Hutchinson, 1987; Barsalou, 1991), such categories reflect a form of categorization distinct from the prototypical approach that dominates organizational theory.\n\nDespite these potential differences, there is little empirical research on the construction of new umbrella categories and in particular how these come to subsume product categories. A goal-derived lens can be useful in this regard, yet much of the discussion of goal-derived categorization in organizational studies has remained conceptual. In particular, we lack evidence of goal-derived categorization processes unfolding at a collective level and how these processes can produce enduring structures. This is because goal-derived categories were originally conceived as ad hoc categories (Barsalou, 1983)—ephemeral structures created when individuals “face unique situations for which they have no comparable previous experiences or expertise” (Durand and Boulongne, 2017: 651), leading them to creatively recombine existing categories to meet their immediate needs.\n\nTo address these lacunae, we adopt a goal-derived lens to study how umbrella categories are constructed and come to nest product categories. While prior conceptual work has suggested that umbrella category construction may differ in important ways from product category construction, these differences have not been elaborated, and moreover, we know little about the linking mechanisms that nest product categories under umbrella categories. We study how such processes unfolded in the context of the Quebec terroir products umbrella category and the Quebec artisanal cheese product category between 1977 and 2013. This context represents a revelatory case (Yin, 2009) because both artisanal cheese production and the notion of terroir were new to Quebec, and the meaning of the former seems to have been transformed as it was nested under the latter. Artisanal cheese had emerged across North America in the 1980s guided by a rejection of industrial production (Paxson, 2010, 2012), but in Quebec, artisanal cheese became representative of Quebec culture and traditions in the way evoked by notions of terroir.\n\nOver our study period, the Quebec terroir products category came to link foods produced in the Canadian province of Quebec to its land, culture, and traditions, valorizing them as symbols of the Québécois identity, as indicated in this quote from a food writer:\n\nLet us be proud of our roots, our terroir and what can grow here despite the northern climate. The Québécois culture is made up of what we produce and eat. We need to discover or rediscover what comes from our soil, from our own production. (Samson, 2010: 11)\n\n“Quebec terroir products” is an umbrella category that includes an array of foods as subcategories, among which the best known is Quebec artisanal cheese. But despite its association with Quebec’s culture and traditions, the Quebec terroir products category entered public discourse and began to be used only in the late 1990s. It reordered the categorical landscape of food products in the province, as diverse categories of foods were nested beneath it. As a prominent food critic wrote in 1999, of all the categories that would become known as Quebec terroir products, “[artisanal] cheese is a star of the Quebec terroir” (Kayler, 1999). Quebec artisanal cheese was considered virtually emblematic of Quebec culture and history, and yet artisanal cheese production was also relatively new to the province, dating only to the 1980s. Cheese producers had initially been motivated by anti-industrial beliefs, without subscribing to notions of Quebec having a cheese-making heritage, and their product category had received little attention prior to it becoming nested under Quebec terroir.\n\nThis paper aims to offer contributions in two main areas. First, we engage with recent work suggesting that category construction can differ dramatically at different vertical levels (Khaire and Wadhwani, 2010; Durand and Khaire, 2017). Specifically, we distinguish between diverse sets of actors—producers, market intermediaries, and macro actors more removed from the market—and trace their involvement in the category construction process at different vertical levels. Notably, our findings reveal that the state can be a direct participant in the category construction process, a largely overlooked phenomenon given the prevailing view in institutional theory that the state’s role is one of raising or lowering entry barriers through regulatory change or financial incentives (Georgallis, Dowell, and Durand, 2019; Grandy and Hiatt, 2020). We also show that while product category and umbrella category construction may begin independently, the two processes may be linked through an identity attribution process whereby market intermediaries project onto producers an identity consistent with that of the umbrella category.\n\nSecond, we contribute to a burgeoning literature in organizational studies on goal-derived categorization (Durand and Paolella, 2013; Durand and Boulongne, 2017; Glaser, Krikorian Atkinson, and Fiss, 2020). Whereas goal-derived categories have mostly been conceptualized as ad hoc categories—created, used, and then discarded by individuals (Barsalou, 1983)—we show that goal-derived categorization can unfold collectively and with enduring effects. Specifically, we show that participants in the category construction process may collectively define a goal and a set of ideals for an umbrella category and only afterward populate the category with a wide diversity of products that appear to approach those ideals. One corollary of this is that goal-derived categorization may begin absent material exemplars and as such can support higher levels of ambiguity than prototypical categories. In this way, we show how goal-derived categorization may give macro actors a means to reorder the categorical landscape despite being removed from the production of marketable goods or services.\n\nUmbrella Categories and Goal-Derived Categorization\n\nCategories are social constructions that differentiate among entities, such as products, people, and organizations (Lamont and Molnar, 2002; Giorgi, Lockwood, and Glynn, 2015). Categories locate an entity within a broader system of meaning or classification (Glynn and Navis, 2013) and in this way organize an otherwise amorphous and bewildering landscape into identifiable clusters. The dominant approach in organization studies conceives of categories as defined by category members’ essential attributes and encapsulated by their category prototype (Durand and Paolella, 2013; Vergne and Wry, 2014). In this attribute-based approach, a category prototype is used by audiences as a “baseline to assess family resemblance” for membership into a category (Glynn and Navis, 2013; Durand and Boulongne, 2017: 651).\n\nConsiderable research has discussed how entrepreneurs construct new market categories. This research shows that entrepreneurs deploy value-laden (Glynn and Navis, 2010; David, Sine, and Haveman, 2013) and coherent accounts that define distinctions with incumbent categories to give meaning to their own (Wry, Lounsbury, and Glynn, 2011; Lo et al., 2020). As Verhaal, Khessina, and Dobrev (2015: 1466) explained, new market categories may coalesce around “producers who define themselves as categorically opposed to the dominant market logic employed by incumbent firms in existing product space.” The emergence of craft beer in the United States provides a well-known example, as it emerged in direct opposition to industrially produced beers—microbreweries and brewpubs defined “the specialty beer segment in ways that exclude major brewers and contract brewers” (Carroll and Swaminathan, 2000: 731). Similarly, producers of grass-fed beef “solidified the set of binary oppositions” with respect to the production, exchange, and consumption of traditional beef (Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey, 2008: 558). In this way, producers stake “a reactionary claim about who they are in direct reference to a set of established incumbents” (Verhaal, Khessina, and Dobrev, 2015: 1467). The dominant imagery of this research is thus that new categories emerge as producers define the central and distinctive attributes of their product categories in contradistinction to horizontal peer categories, such as craft beer versus mass-produced beer, grass-fed beef versus traditionally raised beef, and soft drinks versus alcoholic drinks.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on distinctions with horizontal peers tends to overlook that category systems have a vertical dimension as well (Durand and Boulongne, 2017). In addition to considering horizontal arrays of peer categories, such as different kinds of feature films (Hsu, 2006), wines (Negro, Hannan, and Rao, 2011), software firms (Pontikes, 2012), or restaurants (Kovács, Carroll, and Lehman, 2014), we must also consider categories as being vertically nested under larger, umbrella categories. For example, grappa is part of the larger spirits category (Delmestri and Greenwood, 2016), and sports cars, sedans, trucks, SUVs, and minivans are all part of the larger automobile category (Wry and Lounsbury, 2013). Umbrella categories are significant as they impact the meanings attributed to the subcategories nested under them. As Wry and Lounsbury (2013: 120) explained, “relevant distinctions may sit at higher or lower levels of analysis . . . one possibility is that categories may cohere in configurations that are associated with a higher level aggregate.” For example, Jones and colleagues (2012) described how two new architectural categories, “modern organic” and “modern functional,” were later grouped into a larger, more amorphous category of “modern architecture,” which also included a third category that blended the two styles. Likewise, in their study of the emerging category “modern Indian art,”Khaire and Wadhwani (2010) described how art historians and critics recategorized twentieth-century Indian art under the “modern art” umbrella, which already existed in the West. In both examples, the nesting of focal categories under higher-level categories affected both their meaning and valuation.\n\nYet, there has been little research on the construction of these higher-order umbrella categories. One reason for this lack of attention may be that the attribute-based approach to categorization tends to see new categories largely as increasingly specific subtypes of the larger categories below which they are nested. For example, in their characterization of a vertical category system, Kuilman and Li (2009: 231) stated that “in such a system, one can define a subpopulation as a subset of a general population by combining all the membership-defining features of the general population with some more specific features idiosyncratic to the subpopulation.” Such a view may preclude the study of the construction of new umbrella categories, as it seems to presume that subcategories are constructed as ever more specific subtypes of umbrella categories in a temporally sequenced process. While such a sequence may reflect the emergence of many vertically nested categories, it certainly does not reflect all. Take for example the umbrella category of cleantech (or greentech), which encompasses a wide range of product categories such as solar energy, biofilms, or biodiesel (The Economist, 2007). While the cleantech category clearly informs the understandings of the subcategories that it encompasses, these subcategories share few visible attributes, and moreover, many of the subcategories existed well before being labeled as cleantech. Thus one cannot readily presume a temporal sequencing whereby the category of cleantech first emerged and then fragmented into related but more specific subcategories.\n\nCompared with the attribute-based (i.e., prototypical) approach to categorization, the goal-based approach may prove more fruitful in the study of umbrella categories. 2 At higher vertical levels of categorization, an attribute-based approach may become inapplicable as subcategories may no longer exhibit similar attributes (Loken and Ward, 1990). Goal-derived categorization, in contrast, may better describe umbrella categories that comprise several quite different (prototypical) subcategories that serve the same (often ambiguous and idealized) goal (Ratneshwar, Pechmann, and Shocker, 1996; Ratneshwar et al., 2001). Unlike in the attribute-based approach, where category membership is assessed on the basis of the possession of certain attributes or features (Vergne and Wry, 2014), in the goal-derived approach category membership is assessed based on approaching ideals. Whereas prototypical attributes are visible among the exemplars of a category, ideals refer to qualities that category members may approach but never fully attain in the pursuit of the category goal (Lynch, Coley, and Medin, 2000; Voorspoels, Storms, and Vanpaemel, 2013). In the classic example provided by Barsalou (1985: 630) for the goal-derived category of “foods to eat on a diet,” an ideal is zero calories: “the fewer calories an exemplar has, the better it serves the goal associated with its category, namely, lose weight” (emphasis in original). Returning to the example of cleantech, each (prototypical) subcategory may include highly specific and agreed-upon attributes, but they share little in common across subcategories apart from serving the goal of environmental sustainability. Among the ideals relevant to this category may be that the included technologies be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. In both examples, goals and ideals, not product attributes, provide the lens that unites the objects under the umbrella category.\n\nMoreover, the goal-derived approach can help disentangle the construction of umbrella categories and the subcategories that they encompass. As mentioned above, prior work on the construction of vertically nested prototypical categories suggests that the umbrella category is constructed first and increasingly specific subtypes then follow. But with goal-derived categorization, umbrella categories may be constructed independently of their member categories. In this perspective, category construction “does not rely on exemplars that capture the central tendencies of the category, but on ideals” (Durand and Boulongne, 2017: 652). This point has two implications. First, umbrella categories can begin as empty sets—i.e., with nothing more than a goal—which challenges the dominant view that “categories emerge as audience members recognize similarities among groups of producers and come to regard and label them as members of a common set” (Negro, Koçak, and Hsu, 2010: 7). In effect, goal-derived categorization can begin absent material exemplars. Second, the construction of umbrella categories may be independent of and potentially even follow that of the prototypical product categories they encompass. In fact, the very importance of goal-derived categories derives from their use in creatively recombining existing categories. For example, various prototypical categories of small-scale electricity producers (e.g., wind, solar, biomass) had long existed in relative obscurity until legislators grouped them under the new “alternative energy” umbrella category as part of their effort to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil (Sine and David, 2003). In so doing, legislators not only regrouped existing categories but also reinterpreted them along the lines of the goal of increasing national security. In this way, umbrella categories can reorder the categorical landscape and give new meaning to the subcategories that come to be nested under them.\n\nHowever, much remains to be learned about goal-derived categorization. A goal-derived lens has historically been used to study ad hoc categories: temporary categories created by individuals to meet their immediate goals (Barsalou, 1983). For example, corporate legal services are classified according to sharply defined prototypical categories, yet sophisticated clients for legal services may define their particular goals and populate their goal-derived categories with firms classified under diverse prototypical categories (Paolella and Durand, 2016). Each user can thus potentially construct their own unique (personal-use) goal-derived category without it impacting the category structure prevailing in the field. We know little about how goal-derived categorization may operate at a collective level and whether it can produce enduring, collectively recognized categorization schemes. By extension, we lack understanding of how goal-based categorization can serve as the basis of market exchanges (Glaser, Krikorian Atkinson, and Fiss, 2020). Moreover, an important aspect of considering goal-derived categorization at the collective level is the potential distinction between the goals of category users and those of the actors who construct the category. In the case of ad hoc categories, this distinction is not relevant because users construct their own categories. But in the case of enduring, collectively shared categories, the situation is more complex as users’ goals may differ from those of producers. Returning to Barsalou’s (1985) example of foods to eat on a diet, which he conceived of as an ad hoc category constructed by individuals desiring to lose weight, this category differs from the diet foods market category. The latter reflects a degree of consensus among market actors, yet the goals of users (to lose weight) differ from the goals (or interests) of food and dietary supplement producers or authors of books on dieting, who stand to benefit economically from consumers’ interest in dieting. Accordingly, we refer to the goals of the category from the point of view of users of the category, and we distinguish these goals from the interests of other actors who might benefit from the category’s use.\n\nFinally, building our understanding of goal-derived categorization can help reconcile debates in the extant literature about the role of producers and non-producers in category construction. Grodal (2018: 785) lamented a “division of labor” portrayed in prior work, whereby producers are said to strategically and symbolically make claims and non-producers (often described as the producers’ audiences) evaluate these claims. 3 In contrast, she argued that non-producers “might do more than merely evaluate claims” (Grodal, 2018: 785). Similarly, Pontikes and Kim (2017) argued for more attention to non-producers’ ability to engage in strategic categorization. By helping us elucidate non-producers’“high capacity to influence” categories (Durand and Khaire, 2017: 95), a goal-derived categorization lens can help us better understand their role in the construction of new categories.\n\nMethods\n\nEmpirical Context\n\nWe study the construction of the Quebec terroir products umbrella category and its most prominent member category, Quebec artisanal cheese. At the start of our study period, the concept of terroir as applied to local food products was entirely new to Quebec; similarly, the Quebec artisanal cheese product category was itself new, dating only to the 1980s. That the latter became the most prominent member of the former despite being initially unconnected to terroir—and that the Quebec terroir category became a shared, enduring “category in use”—makes this a revelatory and exemplary case (Yin, 2009) in the study of umbrella categories.\n\nThe construction of these two categories took place during a period of great social upheaval, which must be viewed in the context of Quebec history. Social, political, and economic inequalities between English and French Canadians had spurred the rise of a Quebec nationalist movement in the 1950s (Gundlach and Neville, 2012). The movement produced a change of identity among the French-speaking population of Quebec from “French Canadian” to “Quebecer”—Québécois in French—and intellectuals and activists promoted the Québécois identity to widen the perceived gulf between French- and English-speaking Canadians. Their discourse emphasized Quebec’s pre-conquest past and, by extension, Quebec’s historical links to France (Maclure, 2003; Oakes and Warren, 2007). Ties between the colony of New France and its mother country had been broken after the British Conquest of 1759, and the two societies had evolved along different paths for the next 200 years, resulting in a break with French traditions, including culinary traditions. Intellectuals celebrated the early life of French settlers, claiming that any traditions appearing after the 1759 defeat were of foreign origin and suspect (Maclure, 2003). The nationalist movement culminated in two referenda on secession, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995, the latter resulting in a secessionist defeat by only 0.6 percent. In 2006, the Canadian Parliament passed a motion recognizing the Québécois as a distinct nation within Canada, and secession remains an ongoing debate in the province.\n\nAlthough it is plausible that Quebec society, by virtue of its French origins, might have already had a tradition of fine cheese consumption, this was not the case. Prior to the founding of the first artisanal cheese producers in Quebec in the 1980s, there had been no culture of fine cheese production or consumption in the province. While there had been some cheese production in the French tradition during the early years of New France, dairy consumption in the colony had been largely limited to milk and butter (Lambert, 2006; Desloges and De Courval, 2009). After the surrender of New France to the British and the ensuing influx of British Loyalists from the south, cheddar production grew sharply, particularly fueled by demand in England (Fournier, 1994). Even among the cheddars produced in Quebec, the stronger tasting variants were exported, and Quebecers preferred the milder variants for local consumption (Fournier, 1994; Dubuc, 1996). Save for a few cheeses produced by monastic orders, mild (i.e., bland) industrially produced cheddar remained the norm at the start of our study period.\n\nRather than being a longstanding tradition, and similar to what happened in other parts of North America (Paxson, 2010, 2012), artisanal cheese production in Quebec emerged as part of the back-to-the-land movement, and artisanal cheese producers were highly motivated by a rejection of industrial capitalism. Whereas in “the 1960s and 1970s, such persons sought self-realization through the counterculture; in the 1980s they came to seek self-fulfillment through self-employment” (Paxson, 2012: 67). As we show below, the first artisanal cheese producers appeared in Quebec during the same period, starting in the 1980s. The number of artisanal cheese producers over time is plotted in .\n\nSimilarly, the concept of “terroir” was itself new to Quebec, entering popular discourse only in the late 1990s. Terroir is described generally as “the taste of place” (Trubek, 2008) and is well established in Europe, having contributed to food becoming a vehicle of national identity on that continent (DeSoucey, 2010). Perhaps best known in relation to wine (e.g., Bourgogne or Bordeaux), it is also applied to a wide variety of gastronomic product categories such as Feta cheese, Kalamata olives, and Serrano ham. The concept elevates the importance of place of origin, drawing attention not only to regional natural environments but also to regional cultures and traditions (Barham, 2003). In Europe, the concept has developed over the past 100 years and is codified and regulated, for example as set out in European Commission Rule 1898/2006 on the protection of designation of origin. In contrast, at the start of our study period, Quebec society did not consider its food as particularly distinctive in any way (Bizier, 2012), and the term terroir was a novelty (Lemasson, 2012). No rules or regulations comparable to those in Europe were in place, and the category was referred to only in highly general and aspirational terms. Notably, Quebec terroir was frequently referred to in the singular, ignoring the fact that the large territory of this province contains a number of distinctive regions and micro-climates.\n\nData Collection\n\nprovides a summary of the data collected. We initially collected data on Quebec cheese producers, a product category we understood to be a terroir food. However, we soon realized that this category had not initially been connected to the emergent terroir category and that cheese producers had not been the primary exponents of the terroir category. We thus expanded our data collection both outward in scope and backward in time by collecting data first on the market intermediaries surrounding artisanal cheese (retailers, food critics, journalists) and then on actors more removed from market interactions—macro actors—who our initial data collection suggested were active in constructing the terroir category. Each group of actors required a different set of data, as we describe briefly below.\n\nTable 1.\n\nActor GroupDescriptionMacro-level actors Chefs and culinary instituteBooks and newsletters (7), internal course materials and working documents (10) Government of QuebecInterviews: Project leader for the Quebec regional foods program (1), artisanal cheese sector assignee (1).

Informant selection began by gathering the names of all producers from a government-issued list of small-scale milk-processing permit holders. We verified the websites of all the firms and dropped from the list those that were not artisanal cheese producers. We then sent invitations to all the names on the list and ultimately interviewed 17 artisanal cheese producers located across the province, in each case visiting them at their facility or home. (Producers generally lived next to or near their production facilities.) Interviews generally lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and were transcribed and manually coded.\n\nOur data on market intermediaries comprise books, newspaper articles, and semi-structured interviews. We collected all books pertaining to Quebec terroir products and Quebec cheeses published between 1980 and 2013. Of the books on terroir products, all discussed Quebec cheeses, which frequently represented the most important category of foods discussed in the books in terms of the number of pages. We also collected newspaper articles mentioning Quebec cheeses and Quebec terroir. Using the Eureka database, we searched Quebec’s largest French language daily (La Presse), which was the earliest indexed French language newspaper (starting in 1988). We conducted semi-structured interviews with cheese retailers, food writers, and one of two dedicated artisanal cheese distributors in the province.\n\nFinally, the macro actors active in the construction of the terroir category produced considerable archival data. We began with Solidarité rurale du Québec (SRQ), a not-for-profit activist organization that had been a vocal proponent of terroir during the late 1990s and early 2000s. We realized that the SRQ’s efforts had been an extension of an earlier government program led by the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, which itself was an extension of a project first implemented by the province’s main culinary institute—Institut de tourisme et d’hôtellerie du Québec (ITHQ)—and chefs’ association—Société des chefs, cuisiniers et pâtissiers de la province de Québec (SCCPQ)—in the 1970s. As the culinary institute is a public entity, its older archives, as well as those of the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, were stored at the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ), the provincial archives. We also submitted access-to-information requests to the Quebec government for documents stored in its internal archives and visited the Ministry of Agriculture’s library. Our searches yielded meeting minutes, strategy reports, course notes, newsletters, and other documents pertaining to the culinary institute’s and the government’s activities as early as 1977. We also collected publicly available government documents, including those related to the development and implementation of laws and regulations. Meanwhile, the SRQ had been prolific, and its publications, including its annual reports, were collected from university and public libraries across the province. We also interviewed the individual who had led the government program that we discuss below.\n\nData Analysis\n\nOur analytic approach was one of abduction, as surprising and unexpected initial findings forced us to suspend our initial notions and motivated our subsequent inquiry into the phenomena at hand (Shepherd and Sutcliffe, 2011). As we explained above, we had initially focused on cheese producers but soon expanded our data collection and analysis to include market intermediaries and ultimately macro actors. For each actor group, we analyzed the data in following the steps recommended by Langley (1999) and used by Delmestri and Greenwood (2016). We began by constructing an event history to identify the actors involved and the major events that occurred at various points in time, starting from the first references to the notion of a Quebec terroir (as a term or concept) we could find. Next, staying as close as possible to the words and phrases of our 30 interviewees and the archival materials, we proceeded with open, in-vivo coding (Corbin and Strauss, 2014) of our data for each actor group, looking particularly for references to cultural heritage and geography. 4 Following the advice of Grodal and Kahl (2017), we sought to remain sensitive to the diversity of actor groups involved in the category construction process and to take into account the distinct contexts and interests of these actors.\n\nConcurrently, we engaged in temporal bracketing to identify any “discontinuities” in the process of category construction (Langley, 1999: 703). This revealed four critical junctures in the flow of events: the successive entries of three macro actor groups—hospitality/culinary organizations (ITHQ and SCCPQ), the Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, and the SRQ—as the primary proponents of the Quebec terroir category followed by the entry of market intermediaries (and to a lesser extent cheese producers) in the nesting of artisanal cheese as a terroir product.\n\nWe then sought to group our in-vivo codes into second-order themes that pertained to our general research question, a process that proceeded through several iterations to discern groupings of first-order codes that were both meaningful and discriminant. In the third step of data coding, we considered whether the emerging themes suggested concepts that might help us describe and explain the phenomena of interest (Gioia, Corley, and Hamilton, 2013). We did this by juxtaposing our second-order themes with existing theory so as to generate more-abstract aggregate dimensions (Langley, 1999; Delmestri and Greenwood, 2016). The result was a three-tiered data structure for each actor group (Gioia, Corley, and Hamilton, 2013).\n\nTwo aspects of this data coding process are notable with respect to macro actors. First, as we followed the coding process outlined above, we were struck by strong similarities in our codes across the three macro-actor groups. For example, as each group successively took the lead in attempting to define and implant the terroir category during its respective period, each called for and subsequently engaged in “inventory taking.” This led us to realize that rather than successive stages of a longer process, we were witnessing recurring cycles of a process repeated three times. As such, our development of second-order themes for macro actors involved the constant comparison (Corbin and Strauss, 2014) of codes within each cycle and across cycles. For example, we asked ourselves questions such as “taking inventory of what?” and “why again?” for each set of macro actors.\n\nSecond, juxtaposing emerging second-order themes for macro actors with extant theory in order to develop third-order dimensions led us to revise and expand our theoretical scope. For example, the term “inventory taking” stood at odds with how extant theory tells us that categories are constructed, namely that categories emerge as a function of audiences’ observations of similarity among ostensibly like objects (Negro, Koçak, and Hsu, 2010). Instead, in our context, we were seeing macro-level actors first defining (or redefining) the category at the start of each cycle and only afterward scanning the environment (i.e., taking inventory) to fill the predefined category. We came to the realization that while the extant theory in organization studies focuses almost exclusively on prototypical categories, the sequence we were witnessing appeared consistent with theory on goal-derived categories (Barsalou, 1991).\n\nWith our coding structure for each type of actor in place, we sought to induce “a process model that is both grounded in and sensitive to our case’s particular historical evolution while still being generalizable to other settings” (Croidieu and Kim, 2018: 11). We developed this model by iterating between theory on goal-derived categories and our coding structure, all while taking into account the broader cultural environment within which the process unfolded (Grodal and Kahl, 2017).\n\nDiscussion\n\nUnderstanding the category construction process requires looking beyond a single category and set of producers. We suggest that attention to the vertical dimension of category systems can shed light on how new umbrella categories reorder the categorical landscape and give new meaning to product categories. To this end, we offer in this paper a conceptual model of how umbrella categories are constructed and come to nest product categories, in the process going from empty categories to “categories in use.” Our work builds understanding in two related areas: (1) how vertical nesting occurs and (2) the origins and nature of goal-derived categories and their relationship to prototypical categories.\n\nUmbrella Categories and the Nesting of Product Categories\n\nExtant research on category construction has generally examined single-product categories, focusing on the role of producers (e.g., Glynn and Navis, 2010; David, Sine, and Haveman, 2013) or professional classifiers (e.g., Khaire and Wadhwani, 2010). In that stream of work, category construction turns on defining the key attributes of the products or services that are to fill the category. Consistent with this prior work, we found that cheese producers made category claims about their products. As seen in prior research, such as on craft beer (Carroll and Swaminathan, 2000), grass-fed beef (Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey, 2008), modern architecture (Jones et al., 2012), and management consulting (David, Sine, and Haveman, 2013), the producers in our case employed persuasive discourse to frame their activities in opposition to dominant incumbents and to thereby project an image of themselves “as a coherent category with a meaningful label and identity” (Wry, Lounsbury, and Glynn, 2011: 450). But in our context, a singular focus on cheese producers would have provided an incomplete understanding of how the Quebec artisanal cheese category developed. Producers’ theorization efforts were only one part of a larger story. The meaning of the category arose from the “interaction between multiple self-interested market participants” (Grodal and Kahl, 2017: 157) across vertical levels. Groups of non-producers that we call “macro actors,” such as government agencies and professional associations, constructed an umbrella category. Other groups of non-producers—intermediaries such as journalists and retailers—embedded the product category under the umbrella category and in the process altered its meaning.\n\nKey among our findings was the role of macro actors in constructing a broader umbrella category with the potential to reorder the categorical landscape. Prior research has generally conceived of non-producers as either evaluators or reclassifiers, rarely as category constructors. The literature on market categories has often suggested a “division of labor” (Grodal, 2018: 785) wherein producers theorize and non-producers evaluate those theorizations. As Pontikes and Kim (2017: 83) pointed out, non-producers may be reluctant to engage in new category construction because “developing categories based on original insights, coining labels, and having them catch on broadly, is a risky process that often fails.” We suggest that this observation is less applicable to macro actors, who are further removed from market exchanges and thus less exposed to market risk. As Edman and Ahmadjian (2017: 112) explained in their study of the construction of the ji-biru (local beer) category in Japan by macro actors (they used the term “external actors”), the interests of such actors “lie not in producing, buying or consuming the outputs of an industry” but rather in furthering objectives such as town revitalization, regional economic growth, and tourism. The macro actors in that case, much like in our case, were regional associations and governments removed from market risk, and like in our case, the ji-biru category was initially empty. We conjecture based on our findings that macro actors are actually well placed to conceptualize and propose umbrella categories.\n\nThis finding has particularly important implications for research on the role of the state in category construction, as the literature has tended to confine the state’s role to one of regulation, deregulation, and/or financial support, not active meaning construction. For example, Georgallis, Dowell, and Durand (2019) described how financial and regulatory support for the solar photovoltaic industry in Europe led to its expansion. Similarly, railroads (Dobbin and Dowd, 1997), farm wineries (Swaminathan, 1995), wind power (Sine and Lee, 2009), and private liquor stores (Dowell and David, 2011) required changes in policies and regulations to develop. This regulatory role is in fact a form of evaluation, whereby regulators and policy makers respond favorably to nascent categories. We show a much richer, more active role for the state in the category construction process, whereby the state actively constructs meaning.\n\nNevertheless, our findings also suggest that macro actors, the state included, may not be well placed to construct lasting umbrella categories on their own. Their timelines are longer, and their work is not tied to the success of any single organization or even category of organizations. As a result, macro actors often work at the policy level, involving a wide array of stakeholders, and the categories they propose are unlikely to survive if they are not elaborated upon and filled in with concrete exemplars. Market intermediaries may play an important role in conferring to the umbrella category a semblance of material reality by nesting product categories, while transforming the meaning of those product categories in the process.\n\nOur findings on how market intermediaries do so also help unpack and extend the reclassification role typically attributed to them. Durand and Khaire (2017: 89) explained that intermediaries involved in category construction engage in a “form of rearrangement or cognitive reinterpretation of existing cues to benefit the actors that initiate these processes in material and symbolic ways.” Similarly, Khaire and Wadhwani (2010) showed how auction houses (among other market intermediaries) introduced constructs and criteria imported and adapted from an existing umbrella category (Western modernism) to delineate the nascent category of modern Indian art and provide the basis of valuation and exchange. We extend these findings to show that intermediaries’ reclassification efforts can involve projecting new identities onto the actors involved in the focal category. This includes ascribing new motives to producers to align their actions with the goals of the larger umbrella category, while activating similar attachments among consumers. Intermediaries thus work at the level of identities—in our case encouraging “patriotic” consumers to support “patriotic” producers—to reclassify a set of products under an umbrella category. This points to identity as a lens that serves a sensemaking function that elevates the importance of certain product or organizational attributes over others (Kim and Jensen, 2011; Smith, 2011). For example, viewed through an environmental sustainability lens, proximity would take precedence over origin in food production. But when viewed through a patriotic lens, origin takes precedence over proximity, leading to the “positive collective identity” that is “central to market functioning” (Weber, Heinze, and DeSoucey, 2008: 546).\n\nGoal-Derived Categories\n\nIn the case analyzed here, a goal-derived lens fruitfully described the umbrella category constructed by macro actors. Whereas prototypical categories encompass ostensibly like objects that are evaluated according to their resemblance to a category prototype, goal-derived categories may encompass highly dissimilar objects serving a similar goal that are evaluated according to the degree to which they approach ideals that no category members may ever fully manifest (Barsalou, 1985, 1991; Ratneshwar et al., 2001). “Quebec terroir products” illustrates a goal-derived category comprising highly dissimilar products (e.g., cheeses, meats, wines), all evaluated according to the seemingly unattainable ideals of representing Quebec’s land, culture, and traditions such that they allow consumers to “taste Quebec.”\n\nThis finding expands the conceptualization of goal-derived categories, as it reveals that they can be enduring cognitive structures. Scholarly work to date on goal-derived categories, whether in psychology (e.g., Barsalou, 1983, 1985; Ratneshwar et al., 2001; Voorspoels, Storms, and Vanpaemel, 2013) or organization studies (e.g., Durand and Paolella, 2013; Durand and Boulongne, 2017), has focused on ad hoc, individual-level categorization processes, such as how an individual selects “foods to eat on a diet” the first time one decides to diet. Consequently, goal-derived categories have been discussed as “temporary categories constructed around specific goals in a given context” in order to solve immediate problems (Durand and Paolella, 2013: 1109). Our findings suggest that goal-derived categories can, in fact, be enduring and shared, and our conceptual model thus responds to calls for theory to explain how goal-derived categories might become institutionalized (Glaser, Krikorian Atkinson, and Fiss, 2020). Moreover, processes of goal-derived category construction at the individual level seem to be similar at the collective level: just as individuals “first define a goal, and only afterwards do they observe and organize the reality into categories of objects likely to help them reach their goal” (Durand and Paolella, 2013: 1109), we found that the Quebec terroir category was collectively envisioned by macro actors prior to their collectively scanning the environment to populate the category with exemplars.\n\nOur findings suggest that goal-derived categories can begin absent material exemplars and progressively take shape over time, and as such they can support higher levels of ambiguity than prototypical categories. Whereas prototypical categories do support some degree of ambiguity—because category attributes define only the minimal requirements for category membership (Glynn and Navis, 2013)—the ambiguity of the Quebec terroir products category appeared to be much greater. Even as late as the early 2000s, when the term “Quebec terroir” was in widespread use, many actors in the field could not define the concept (Cimon-Morin, 2004). Rather than a hindrance, this ambiguity appeared to facilitate collective action among a diverse set of actors, a finding consistent with work showing the relationship between ambiguity and diffusion (David and Strang, 2006; Giroux, 2006). Lacking tangible exemplars to guide them, macro-level actors began by expressing ideals, which may have also proven less contentious than defining specific product attributes. Moreover, ideals can remain stable even while the attributes of the member products evolve dramatically over time. This extends our understanding of how goal-derived categories can provide a basis for market exchanges through a process of “goal-based attribution” whereby market value is determined more by perceptions of attaining an ideal than by possessing particular attributes (Glaser, Krikorian Atkinson, and Fiss, 2020: 938). It also helps us to understand how category ambiguity can persist, not necessarily because actors apply multiple frames to a category (Chliova, Mair, and Vernis, 2020) but because the product attributes that are thought to lead to an ideal may not be clear or may change over time. As a point of comparison with our case, one may consider the category cleantech (or greentech), which encompasses a wide range of product categories under an ideal of carbon neutrality. The member categories of cleantech will likely change over time as new and better technologies emerge and the environmental impacts of older technologies become better known, but the guiding ideal can remain stable over time.\n\nThus goal-derived categorization may prove particularly relevant in contexts of changing societal values and beliefs, as a means to reimagine markets and guide entrepreneurial behavior. Extant organizational research has often focused on the role of entrepreneurs who attempt to legitimate their novel offering by drawing on changing values and beliefs (David, Sine, and Kaehr Serra, 2017). For example, soft-drink producers referenced the values of the Temperance Movement at the birth of the soft-drink category (Hiatt, Sine, and Tolbert, 2009), just as management consultants deployed the values of the Progressive Movement at the birth of management consulting (David, Sine, and Haveman, 2013). However, in other cases, the reframing may be done prior to the innovation itself (Durand and Khaire, 2017) as a means of guiding subsequent entrepreneurial activity. For example, Rao and colleagues (2003) showed that French nouvelle cuisine emerged not because practicing chefs introduced new recipes but because certain French culinary elites translated the anti-authoritarian values of the May 1968 protests into the sphere of cooking. These (macro) actors set forth ideals such as transgression and acclimatization that gained meaning as they were increasingly instantiated by practicing chefs across France (Rao, Monin, and Durand, 2003, 2005). Thus actors removed from markets may turn to goal-derived categorization to set forth new value-laden goals and ideals that guide subsequent entrepreneurial activity.\n\nImplications and Future Research\n\nWhere might processes similar to the ones uncovered here be found? We would look first for contexts in which macro actors take an active approach to markets. We know that there is variance (in geography and over time) in how active states are not just in regulating markets but also in trying to shape them (Hall, 2015), and our findings might be more generalizable to other contexts where states take a more active role in markets. More generally, contexts with more scope for collective action in the economy by macro actors—not only governments but also professional associations and non-governmental organizations—may see more frequent attempts at umbrella category construction. We might also look for contexts with active social movements circulating new sets of values and beliefs across society. Without the Quebec nationalist movement promoting the belief that Quebec constitutes a distinct nation, the goal of “tasting Quebec” may have never formed the basis of an enduring umbrella category. Similarly, the widely circulating value (and related social movement) of environmental sustainability, for example, underpins the umbrella category of cleantech, an ambiguous category that nests a variety of prototypical categories.\n\nNaturally, certain aspects of our context may limit the generalizability of our findings and thus call for future research. First, with respect to umbrella category construction, we found that new macro actors entered after each failed attempt. It is possible instead that existing macro actors could reconceptualize the umbrella category in subsequent attempts, although in our case, each new macro-actor group breathed new life into the umbrella category, which otherwise could very well have been abandoned. Second, not all umbrella categories are fruitfully seen through a goal-derived lens. Higher-order categories could be prototypical in nature, and in such cases macro actors may have more limited scope to reorder the categorical landscape.\n\nWith respect to producers, we found indifference among many artisanal cheese producers in fueling the beliefs that artisanal cheeses were representative of Quebec culture and traditions, such that this role fell largely to intermediaries. Cheese producers may have been particular in their desire to remain small, and it is possible that producers in other categories may be more assertive in nesting their categories under the umbrella category, particularly if they ascertain (and desire) economic gain. Moreover, once the umbrella category is well established, new categories may subsequently be “born under” that umbrella. At the same time, it is interesting to consider how the nesting of an existing product category (such as artisanal cheese) might affect its original identity. Will we see a layering of identities, in this case anti-industrial and patriotic, or a displacement of the original identity in favor of the projected one?\n\nThis research opens new doors into the study of goal-derived categories. We show that such categories are not always ephemeral structures; they can persist over time and form the basis of collective action. Yet this does not imply stasis. Future research could investigate the co-evolution of higher-order umbrella categories and the prototypical categories nested underneath. Might the accumulation of prototypical categories under an umbrella category alter the latter’s meaning? And how might the meanings associated with prototypical categories change as a result of their nesting or the nesting of other prototypical categories? In nascent markets characterized by an evolving and diverse set of organizations and products (Grodal, Gotsopoulos, and Suarez, 2015), goal-derived categorization may be common as it readily permits evolution and change in the member organizations given the inherent ambiguity of the ideals that define the category. Over time, we may find that goal-derived umbrella categories take on more prototypical attributes as the two modes of categorization co-exist, the former defining the value-laden goals served by the category and the latter employed to identify the attributes used to assess category membership."
