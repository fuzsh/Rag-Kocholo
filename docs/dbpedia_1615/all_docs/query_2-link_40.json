        "text": "This piece results from news I received about a court case in Sussex. I started digging, and it got to be like peeling an onion. Perhaps not pleasant, but there you go, that’s life.\n\nObviously I won’t comment on the case itself, or the proceedings. What I’ll do is look at the fascinating connections the accused man has across southern Wales.\n\nAnd wondering how to make sense of it all. Any and all suggestions welcome.\n\n◊\n\nWORKING BACKWARDS\n\nThe case I was directed to began at Lewes Crown Court in Sussex last Monday. A Syrian, living in Swansea, was charged with bringing people from Vietnam into the country illegally, through Newhaven.\n\nHere’s how the incident was originally reported in February.\n\nThe man’s name is Anas al Mustafa, and in a previous report, his address was given as ‘Heather Crescent, Swansea’. This is on the Sketty Park estate, the road running from Sketty Park Drive up to the flats.\n\nAs you might guess, Swansea being my home town, I got to wondering about him.\n\nMy source had directed me to the Companies House website, and the company A & T Food Transport Ltd. Which made sense, seeing as the latest news report mentioned ‘a refrigerated van’.\n\nThere seem to be a number of addresses linked to this company, in Swansea and Cardiff; with Anas al Mustafa also taking us to Bedwas. So let’s see what it all tells us.\n\n◊\n\nA & T FOOD TRANSPORT LTD\n\nThe address given for the company is 22 Caepistyll Street, which links Carmarthen Road with Llangyfelach Street, running past St Joseph’s Cathedral primary school.\n\nThere have been three directors. The man on trial in Sussex. Who is described as British. He resigned 29.09.2023. A Swedish citizen named Mohammad Mustafa al Mustafa, who might be a kinsman. He joined the company 22.11.2023. And Ahmad Farhan Hudad, who filled in between one al Mustafa leaving and the other joining.\n\nThe property in Caepistyll Street used as the company address is owned by the Coastal Housing Group, which I believe is the biggest housing association in Swansea. Here’s the property title document.\n\nIt seems that Muhammad al Mustafa from Sweden now lives in Caepistyll St. Is he the registered tenant? What do the Coastal Housing rules say about running a business from its properties?\n\nAnd come to that, how does a citizen of a wealthy country like Sweden qualify for social housing in Wales?\n\nAnd although the accused’s address is given in the media as being in Sketty Park, on the Companies House entry both he and Hudad give their address as 52 Ceri Road, Townhill. Which, as the title document confirms, is owned by Swansea council.\n\nI have the exact address for Heather Crescent, where the company was based until October 12, 2023, and where the accused is said to live, but this property is privately owned and I’m assuming there’s no connection between the owners and those who probably rented it. So we’ll leave that there.\n\nLet’s end this section by reminding ourselves that the arrested man, Anas al Mustafa, left A & T Food Transport at the end of September last year. The company is now run by the Swedish citizen I believe to be related, Mohammad al Mustafa.\n\n◊\n\nTHE THIRD MAN\n\nAs I’ve said, the third director of the Swansea company was Ahmad Farhan Hudad. He seems to have been holding the fort during the interregnum.\n\nHudad has been involved in two other companies.\n\nOne being Amana Accountant Ltd. This company also uses the Ceri Road address. Does Swansea council have rules about running businesses from council houses?\n\nThere was never much to speak of in terms of money in this company until the accounts for y/e 31.01.2024 showed £50,000 appearing as intangible assets. (Later in the accounts described as ‘goodwill’.)\n\nThe second company is Pure General Trading Ltd. The other director here is Hiwa Mohammed Salman Amin. He gives as his address the new company address on the Enterprise Park in Llansamlet. To be exact, Unit 1, Aber Court, off Ferryboat Close.\n\nThere’s no money in this company, it files as dormant.\n\nThese Llansamlet properties are owned by Swansea council and this particular unit was leased in March 1981 for 75 years. So it’s presumably rented from the lessor.\n\nBut Pure General Trading began life, in May last year, at 83 Mansel Street, just out of the city centre, a scruffy property next-door to a nail bar.\n\nNo 83 is either being rented or, if it’s been sold, then the records haven’t been updated with the Land Registry.\n\n◊\n\nTHE CARDIFF CONNECTION\n\nIf we turn to the Certificate of Incorporation for A & T Food Transport Ltd we see the company’s address given as being in St Mellons.\n\nWhile Anis al Mustafa, the founding director, gives his address as 224 Whitchurch Road.\n\nThis Whitchurch Road property is owned by Somarz Properties LLP. Here’s the title document. Somarz seems to buy up property in and around Cardiff.\n\nThough there’s a strange pattern to the dealings. If we check the Charges, we see that nineteen were delivered from the Principality Building Society on November 5, 2019 (one on Nov 4).\n\nNothing then until four were delivered in July 2022 from Arbuthnot Latham and Co (two of which were satisfied the same month), then a gap of two years until two more were delivered last month from Ultimate Bridging Finance Ltd.\n\nBut I’m having trouble making sense of it. Let me explain.\n\nIf we look at the latest (filleted) accounts for Somarz Properties LLP, to March 30, 2023, we see a massive jump in the value of ‘investments’ from the previous year. An increase of some £14.5m.\n\nYet, to go by the charges registered with Companies House, the only acquisition in that period was 131A Cyncoed Road. (The smaller property at the front.) And nice though Cyncoed might be, there’s no way a house on someone’s drive runs to £14.5m.\n\nOne possibility is that this windfall came from Zafar Malik, who seems to have died late in 2022, and who I assume was related to the current Partners. He was not a good landlord. Or a good neighbour.\n\nAs I’ve said before, Limited Liability Partnerships can be used to hide a multitude of sins. And very often do.\n\n◊\n\nAND SO TO BEDWAS\n\nI’ve spent some happy hours in Bedwas, my Best Man hailed from there. Hell of a boy, Dai. Dead now.\n\nHe once told me a truly weird story from his youth, about sharing a police cell with former politician Ron Davies. It was somewhere in eastern England, typical Valleys boys on tour sort of thing. Struggling now to remember the details. Wish I could ask him.\n\nAnyway, the man we began this tale with, the man on trial in Sussex, was also involved with a company in Bedwas. The company is still in existence, and it’s called A & B Marble Ltd.\n\nThere were two directors to begin with, the other one being Bilal Mahmoud Abou Isha. This company was launched March 4, 2020, at Aftab Foroze Consultancies Ltd in Bristol, with share capital of £10,000 split equally between the two directors.\n\nI couldn’t find A & B at the address given, Unit B4, Pantglas Farm Industrial Estate. But at that address we do find Royal Marble. All explained by the fact that A & B Marble trades as Royal Marble. Which throws up another query.\n\nA & B Marble Ltd is just over 4 years old, but the Royal Marble website tells us:\n\nWith over 20 years of experience, Royal Marble offers the highest quality quartz, granite and marble stone in the region.\n\nSo what was the registered company name for Royal Marble before A & B Marble?\n\nBut then the Royal Marble Facebook page says:\n\nWith over 25 years of experience, Royal Marble has offered the highest quality Quartz, Granite & Marble stone in the region.\n\nTo confuse matters further, there’s another website, this time for ‘Royal Kitchen Designs‘, explained thus:\n\nRoyal Kitchen Designs is a family-owned business, born out of the success of its sister company, Royal Marble, also in Bedwas, Caerphilly.\n\nThere’s something not right about these websites and FB page. They smack of ‘library images’, or even AI. They lack the human touch. Also lacking names.\n\nAnd again, there’s little in the way of money or assets showing in the accounts, Despite all that expensive material on site and claiming to employ 5 or 6 people.\n\nBefore getting into the fitted kitchen business Abou Isha had a catering company in Neath called Damasspice Ltd, which lasted just a couple of years. It filed just one set of accounts, as a dormant company.\n\nWhen Anas al Mustafa left A & B Marble he was replaced by another Syrian, Awad Mohammad Almobarack. Then he left A & B Marble in December 2021, and has surfaced again starting up two companies over in Pontypool earlier this year.\n\nSo we have a company in Bedwas that’s been going for 20 years (or is it 25), but it’s unclear under which flag it was sailing for most of that time because A & B Marble didn’t exist before March 2020.\n\nIn fact, a cynic might wonder if A & B Marble of Bedwas was formed solely to get a loan from the Development Bank of Wales. (Didn’t I mention that!)\n\n◊\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo many short-lived companies, with virtually no money or assets showing in the accounts (apart from one), and constant changes of address and personnel, can often look suspicious.\n\nAnd so many different types of business. Such a multi-talented crew merits the title I’ve given this piece.\n\nThere’s even a sort of pattern, in that two guys form a company, then go their separate ways and recruit someone else for a new company, then it’s a case of rinse and repeat.\n\nVirtually all those involved are Syrian. Making it reasonable to assume a Syrian link to these companies. But what is that link, and how does it operate?\n\nAnd then there’s the question of how those involved managed to get social housing so easily. Did they claim to be refugees? Or did they say they was local boys, like?\n\nAnd how much due diligence was undertaken by that respected institution, the Development Bank of Wales, before lending to A & B Marble Ltd?\n\nFinally, those who preach Nation of Sanctuary, and demand open borders, really need to grow up and consider the real world consequences of being so ‘progressive’.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nDon’t worry, I won’t be looking at every incident we’ve witnessed in recent weeks, or dwelling on the insane sentences handed down for poking your tongue out at cops, or being a couple of streets away from a riot.\n\nThis post is made up of assorted observations and musings about the situation in the UK and elsewhere, particularly the USA. And while the different sections may not at first sight appear to link, believe me, they do. Taken together they help explain why we are where we are.\n\nWell, that’s certainly what I think. But you’re free to form and express your own opinion. Because that’s how democracy should work.\n\n◊\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWe are witnessing a co-ordinated assault on the white working class. And so we need to ask why, for the first time ever, this group finds itself under attack from all sides.\n\nBecause in times past workers and peasants were defended by radicals, thinkers, certain churches, even poets. More recently they had political parties. But today, the white working class is not simply abandoned, it is openly reviled.\n\nI’m old enough to remember a time when the working class was the ‘vanguard of the revolution’, extolled by the comrades and lauded by intellectuals. Horny-handed sons of toil who would lead us to the Promised Land, or the Sunlit Uplands (depending on which ticket you’d bought).\n\nBut a major ‘problem’ with members of the white working class always was that despite voting for socialist parties most were not socialist, let alone revolutionary. Most just wanted something better for themselves and their children.\n\nI can confirm this from my own background and upbringing.\n\nAnd as was discovered in a famous blind survey done in 1929 in Germany, even those who voted for socialist parties could switch to the right because they were socially conservative, believing in law and order, the family structure, and the homeland.\n\nCracks appeared in the 1980s, with Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the USA, both of whom enjoyed working class support. Then came flirtations with UKIP and the Brexit Party; the fall in trade union membership; before finally, and fatally, voting for Brexit in 2016.\n\nIn the same year, many of their blue collar cousins voted for Donald Trump. Making 2016 the watershed year, the final rupture between lower orders and an elite now being worked into frenzies by contrived ‘crises’.\n\nThose the left had once revered were now redundant, in more senses than one.\n\n◊\n\n‘MY SELFISH GRAN!‘\n\nOne of the most revealing pieces in the wake of Brexit came from the BBC. I assumed some executive sent a crew down to interview his kids and their friends at Glastonbury. The video produced was a hoot.\n\nOne boy interviewed blamed his gran, “who’s going to probably die in the next couple of years“. No thought from the arrogant little sod that his gran, and her generation, have contributed their lives to the country they live in, and that gives them a say in the future, however little of it they see.\n\nAnother report from the BBC said that ‘non-graduates’ were more likely to have voted Leave. In other words, the futures of Arabella and her chums at ‘Glasto’ had been blighted by a bunch of thick bastards. How could the oiks be so selfish!\n\nThe reporting after Brexit, and then the Trump victory in November, got a little febrile. For some of our betters it really was the end of civilisation as they’d imagined it – people were no longer listening to them!\n\nAnd it reeked of caste arrogance.\n\nBut as I say, doubts had been growing for some time about the trustworthiness of the white working class; 2016 merely confirmed the worst fears of the metropolitan elite.\n\nIt would have to be replaced. (The white working class not the metropolitan elite.)\n\nAnd so it came to pass that the hard left and the metro elite (often difficult to tell apart) fell in with the Globalist plan to replace the ‘useless eaters’ with migrants from countries that might appear to be shit-holes, but had been thriving and prosperous democracies before the arrival of the (now increasingly vilified) white man.\n\nOr so we’re expected to believe.\n\nAnd so, to replace the white working class the left adopted minorities and migrants. But to ensure success they would need more minorities, and more migrants. That’s why today we have 69 genders, DEI, open borders, and ‘‘the global majority‘.\n\nThe last in that list is the latest variant of, ‘Let’s all gang up on Whitey!‘ It seems to believe a Chinese nuclear physicist will identify with George Floyd.\n\nNaked racism. But so ‘progressive’.\n\n◊\n\nA BRIEF NOTE ON GLOBALISM\n\nI’ve explained Globalism enough times on this blog, but for those who missed it, or weren’t paying attention, I’ll give a quick recap.\n\nBy Globalists I mean unaccountable corporations like BlackRock and Vanguard; equally unaccountable supranational bodies such as the EU Commission, the UN (and its many agencies); and multi-billionaires who fund far left politicians and public officials, who breed and release mosquitoes, or who manipulate the weather.\n\nAll brought together by the World Economic Forum and other bodies. Also attending these gatherings are young politicians, to be flattered and groomed.\n\nTo the point where most national governments in the West are little more than the Globalists’ local management teams.\n\nThose that reject Globalism will be isolated and attacked, traduced by the Globalist media. We’ve seen it with Trump, Farage, Milei, Le Pen, Meloni, Orban and many others, including Putin. The pattern is consistent and predictable.\n\n◊\n\nNOTHING NEW\n\nPolitical leaders being just figureheads takes me back to the early ’60s, and a phrase that’s haunted me since then. It was something said by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas Police HQ.\n\nTo insistent reporters, he says, “I’m just a patsy“.\n\nLet me make clear that I don’t dispute Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the plot to assassinate John F Kennedy. But I believe that by the time that recording was made he’d twigged he was being sacrificed to draw attention away from others.\n\nAnd so he was silenced, by a shady individual, originally from Chicago, and with strong Mafia ties, who just waltzed in off the street with a gun in his pocket.\n\nI’m afraid that’s how the USA has been run for a long time. And deep state control worked fine under the uniparty system. Which is why Globalism could be viewed as the deep state’s uniparty model taken beyond the USA.\n\nThe deep state that has orchestrated regime changes, invasions, proxy wars, that have killed millions, and brought misery to many millions more.\n\nOf course liberals and leftists oppose this behaviour.\n\nYet when the deep state / Globalists preach ‘diversity’ and ‘saving the planet’ the left can’t get their placards and paint out quick enough.\n\nAre they really that stupid?\n\nIf Lee Harvey Oswald is ancient history to you, then remember Jeffrey Epstein, who could have destroyed many powerful people, perhaps the deep state itself . . . if he hadn’t conveniently suicided himself in 2019. Done in a high security facility that suddenly suffered malfunctioning CCTV cameras and absent guards.\n\nThen, just last month, a strange young man was allowed to walk around a crowded field with a rifle, use a rangefinder to judge the distance to his target, put up a ladder, and crawl over a roof to fire shots at Donald Trump.\n\nEverybody saw him – but nobody did anything until the shots had been fired. Then he too was killed before he could talk.\n\nShortly afterwards Joe Biden was told he’d resigned as figurehead president. (You didn’t think stumblin’, mumblin’ Joe was really in charge!)\n\nSo who do you think’s running the USA right now? I’ll tell you.\n\nThe same people who’ve been calling the shots for 60 years or more (apart from one recent interlude), and will continue to run the USA, and the West, if the votes can be rigged to get Harris elected.\n\nWhich neatly brings us up to the modern period.\n\n◊\n\nCOVID, WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION, DONALD TRUMP\n\nTrump in the White House did not build the wall he’d promised, but neither were the floodgates opened (as would happen under his successor). However the deep state couldn’t risk him having a second term.\n\nSo let’s recall how things worked out.\n\nThe presidential election was scheduled for November 3, 2020. Covid was first reported in China – at a US-funded lab – in late 2019. The first case outside of China was reported in Thailand January 13, 2020.\n\nAnd on it went with, what in retrospect, may have been a very important development. One that helped seal Trump’s fate in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJuly 7, 2020 The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpasses 3 million.\n\nThe U.S. begins the process of withdrawing from WHO.\n\nOne of Joe Biden’s first acts after being inaugurated in January 2021 was to reverse Trump’s decision for the USA to leave the World Health Organisstion (WHO).\n\nThe WHO is a UN agency. One that has increasingly – and largely thanks to Covid – taken on itself a role that it was never set up to fulfil. To the extent of over-ruling elected governments to enforce lockdowns, travel restrictions, and censorship.\n\nFor the WHO complements the political and economic agendas of the WEF and other Globalist organisations.\n\nThings came to a head earlier this year with the WHO’s plan for a global pandemic treaty, which was rejected by a number of countries. There were many reservations about handing so much power to a body of unelected bureaucrats.\n\nIt may also have failed because it was rushed through. And if it was rushed through, then it could have been the prospect of Trump winning in November that explains the haste.\n\nHere’s the article from which the above panel comes (with working links).\n\nThe events of 2016 proved that the white working class in the anglosphere was losing faith in its elites and the systems that sustained those elites.\n\nThough in the UK, the political establishment tried to carry on very much as if Brexit had never happened. While still managing to blame (non-graduate) Brexit voters for just about anything that went wrong.\n\nIn the USA, the priority became stopping Donald Trump being re-elected in 2020. Which was successful, thanks to the ‘relaxations’ on the security of the voting process – justified by Covid!\n\nFour years on the priority is again stopping Donald Trump.\n\n◊\n\nELON MUSK TO THE RESCUE\n\nSince the tragedy in Southport we’ve seen riots, ‘counter-protests’ (when there was no protest to counter), and the police and judiciary acting with unprecedented celerity and firmness.\n\nCounter-protests in which everybody seemed to be carrying Socialist Workers Party placards. (An organisation many suspect is controlled by MI5.)\n\nWith a few exceptions, those brought before the courts and sent to prison have been white and working class. Usually from communities in northern England suffering economic decline, that may also have known ‘grooming’ gangs.\n\nA process defended by a media that long ago prostituted itself to the Globalist elite.\n\nA media that tells you the countryside is ‘racist’, controlled by white men all of whose ancestors kept and brutalised slaves, and where cows are destroying the planet. It’s a fascist hell behind that hedgerow!\n\nWhen minds are fucked up with crap like that it’s only a short step to marching with placards declaring, ‘Gays for Hamas’.\n\nWhich may explain why fewer and fewer of us bother with the established media. We get our news from the internet, and the most popular social media platform is Elon Musk”s X. Which is why it’s being targeted by the Globalists and their puppets.\n\nNot just just because Musk allows free speech, but also because he plans to put tens of millions into the Trump campaign coffers. Additionally – though few seem to know – because he’s planning to launch a rival search engine to Google.\n\nFor Google is very much under Globalist control. Manifest in some truly bizarre ways. Such as hindering searches for the Trump assassination attempt!\n\nAnd Google has run into other problems.\n\n◊\n\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR\n\nI’m a big fan of The Simpsons, recording episodes from Channel 4. I must have hundreds saved. Last Thursday, feet up on pouffe, I watched Series 26 Episode 21.\n\nIn which Bart gets bullied at the school dance. So mom Marge calls a town hall meeting that votes to outlaw bullying. And do you know what happens? People start accusing those they don’t like – of bullying. And the accused get arrested.\n\nEvery trivial little thing becomes ‘bullying’. For example, Homer accuses Apu at the Kwik-E-Mart of bullying because he put too much ice in Homer’s soda.\n\nLater, Homer sits on the couch with children Lisa and Bart watching more arrests on TV. Lisa sagely concludes, “The police are arresting basically anyone they want to.” Homer replies, “Lisa, you’ve got to learn to trust your government“.\n\nThen he picks up a table lamp from alongside the couch and says into the lampshade – in an obvious attempt to convince whoever might be listening – “Which is what I do”.\n\nInevitably, Homer too is arrested, when the Flanders boys next door complain about him bullying their father. As he’s being ‘cuffed, Homer says, “Oh, I never dreamed that a law I had abused could be applied to me“.\n\nHomer eventually has to crawl, literally, to beg Ned Flanders’ forgiveness, which is slow in coming. For the real punishment is publicly humiliating and neutering a ‘bully’.\n\nThere is a political message in this episode on a par with anything that used a more serious format to warn us of totalitarianism.\n\nBut if you still don’t get it . . . substitute for bullying ‘hate speech’, ‘disinformation’, ‘racism’, ‘misinformation’, ‘Islamophobia’.\n\nAnd check your lampshades!\n\n◊\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI’ve referred throughout to the white working class, but what’s really at stake is the survival of the countries built by white people. What were once prosperous and stable democracies, now under attack from all sides.\n\nOn the one hand we have the Globalists, but we don’t see them, for they operate through their captured politicians. And at street and societal level, they work through pressure groups, NGOs, uncontrolled immigration, climate hysteria, and just about anything that can make the West ‘wobble’.\n\nAnd of course the Globalists still have traditional media. Because when you control the narrative you can lie to your heart’s content, and call anyone who challenges you with the truth a ‘conspiracy theorist’, or a pusher of ‘misinformation’.\n\nAs we saw a few weeks ago.\n\nWhen a misidentification of the Southport killer as a Muslim immigrant was quickly capitalised on to become Starmer’s Reichstag Fire moment.\n\n1/ A silly mistake became ‘misinformation’, and was used to bring in a crackdown on social media that was surely already planned.\n\n2/ The UK government and the media introduced ‘Islamophobia’ into the mix in order to further justify the crackdown. (And maybe future legislation.)\n\n3/ Attributing the riots to the initial misidentification of the killer allowed the government to avoid the real cause of the riots – uncontrolled immigration.\n\nLeaving us in a sort of stand-off.\n\nFor the time being, a disgruntled white working class has been cowed, but the cause of the anger cannot even be whispered, let alone addressed. Yet we know that when people are backed into a corner, frustrated and angry, they often lash out.\n\nThe onus is therefore on the UK government to defuse the situation by reaching out to its own people, to assure them they are not victims of a ‘two-tier’ system, and to at least listen to their concerns.\n\nWhat they must not do is punch down harder on the white working class, or anyone else expressing dissent. Only dictatorships do that.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nThis piece has been prompted by information received from Scotland, which may clear up a lingering mystery, while also telling us more about the operations of those involved with Parabola Bute Energy.\n\nI use that name because I’m convinced that Bute Energy, which wants to build some 20 wind farms in Wales, plus other installations, also mile after mile of pylons, is little more than a venture into the renewables sector by property group Parabola.\n\nI say that because the ultimate holding company for all Bute companies is Windward Global Ltd. This company is controlled by Oliver James Millican. He is the son of Peter John Millican, who runs Parabola.\n\nThe son worked for the father at Parabola, as did the other Bute principals (though some have since left Bute). They all ‘departed’ Parabola late in 2017 or early in 2018.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I’ll stick to the name you’ve become familiar with.\n\n◊\n\nNEWS FROM THE NORTH\n\nI’ve written a lot about ‘Bute Energy’, in its various incarnations, but always from a Welsh perspective. And despite consistently identifying it as a Scottish company, I’ve never really looked into what Bute’s owners might have got up to in Scotland.\n\nSo let’s put that right. Starting with a warehouse, a very big warehouse, over 122,000 sq ft; it’s to the east of Glasgow, not far off the M8, which runs to Edinburgh.\n\nIt was reported on October 2, 2018 that the Titan warehouse had been bought for £6.5M by Grayling Capital. This is Grayling Capital LLP, formed just over a year earlier.\n\nIf we turn to the Members of this LLP, we see the names of Oliver James Millican, Stuart Allan George, and Lawson Douglas Steele. These are the names we’ve become familiar with as they keep turning up as directors of the Bute companies in Wales.\n\nAt the bottom of the list we see David James Taylor, a Labour insider in Wales whose name has cropped up a few times in the Bute saga.\n\nThe warehouse had been used by Lidl, but the company decided to move out to a purpose-built warehouse of their own. So Grayling looked around for a buyer. They didn’t find one, but the Covid pandemic did provide a tenant, in the form of the Scottish government. Or rather, the Scottish NHS.\n\nThe lease runs to 31 January 2031, at £766,094 per annum. Which was a good bit of business for Grayling, but it got better. For in March 2021 the warehouse was sold for £14.326m to the Lothian Pension Fund. Ultimately owned by the City of Edinburgh Council.\n\nThough I ask myself, why did Lothian Pension Fund pay £14.3m for a property it must have known sold for half that price just over two years earlier? Did the Auditor General get involved?\n\nGrayling Capital LLP is now liquidated.\n\nIn the report I just linked to you’ll see the sale worded thus:\n\nThe Lothian Pension Fund has acquired a prime logistics warehouse at Eurocentral in North Lanarkshire from Windward Titan.\n\nWindward Titan was a vehicle set up specifically for the warehouse deal in Scotland, and that explains why it hasn’t been mentioned on this blog. Though ‘Windward’ should certainly be familiar to regular readers. It crops up with a number of other companies.\n\nWindward Titan is now dissolved.\n\nThe directors were of course Millican, Steele, and George. Control was exercised by Windward Enterprises Ltd, which is now – since St David’s Day this year – known as Windward Energy Ltd. Which is in turn owned by the company mentioned above as the ultimate holding company, Windward Global Ltd.\n\nHere’s the warehouse disappearing from the Windward Titan balance sheet.\n\nYou’ll see that the warehouse was valued at just over £7 million. It sold for £14.3 million. And on top of that there’s the income of £766,000 a year from the Scottish NHS until 2031. Did that lease transfer to the new owner?\n\nWhat’s more, a Scottish source tells me that the value of the warehouse was increased because as part of the lease the Scottish government agreed to undertake improvements costing £2.75m.\n\nBizarrely, this work meant that the warehouse could not be used at the height of the pandemic – which was the reason for taking out the lease in the first place!\n\nOne reason I find this story from Scotland so interesting is that it seems to presage what we’ve seen in Wales. More on this later.\n\nAnother reason is that those involved in the warehouse deal are now in Wales posing as planet savers, but they are first and foremost property speculators.\n\nNever, ever, forget that.\n\n◊\n\nWHO FILLED THEIR BOOTS, AND HOW?\n\nWindward Titan was started with a single £1 share and there was never any money in the kitty, just the value of the warehouse. The only cash money appeared at the end, from the parent company, to settle up with the liquidators.\n\nSo to follow the money we need to turn to Grayling Capital LLP.\n\nA LLP is a Limited Liability Partnership, popular with solicitors, accountants, and other professionals working as a partnership. When used in a more commercial context it can disguise ‘opaque’ dealings.\n\nWhat you see below is from the final page of Windward Titan’s financial statement for year ending 31.03.2020.\n\nIt tells that the Titan warehouse was bought by Windward Titan with a loan from parent company Windward Enterprises Ltd. And it also confirms that everything is ultimately owned by Windward Global Ltd and Oliver James Millican.\n\nTo return to Labour insider David James Taylor. Who’d been Spad to Peter Hain MP and Welsh first ministers Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones. More specifically, to the money given to his company Moblake Ltd (originally Moblake Wind Ventures Ltd).\n\nThere were two possible sources for the ‘interest free loan’ of £605,872 Taylor made to himself. Both linked to Bute.\n\nOne was his shares in Windward Energy Ltd (formerly Windward Enterprises Ltd), but he held these shares until July 22, 2022. Whereas the mysterious £600,000+ had been and gone from Moblake at least a year earlier.\n\nThe answer would seem to be Taylor being a Member of Grayling Capital LLP. He ceased being a Member September 13, 2021, which ties in with the sale of the Titan warehouse in March of that year to the Lothian Pension Fund.\n\nThe question then becomes . . . why was Taylor, living either in Wales or London, involved with a Scottish company doing business in Scotland?\n\nI think the answer may lie in the timing. Taylor joined Grayling Capital in September 2019, a year after the Bute boys seem to have found their way to Wales. They hired him to open doors in Corruption Bay and elsewhere.\n\nSo let’s look at what happened. And how I think it was done.\n\n◊\n\nBUTE COMES TO WALES\n\nNow we’re going to look at how a clearly Scottish company manoeuvred itself into such a dominant position in Wales. But it could only have been done with the help of the Labour party.\n\nOn this blog, I first mentioned Bute Energy in November 2018, in Corruption in the wind?. But only tangentially. For I was really writing about a guy named Radford, who wanted to build three wind farms; two in Powys, the other in Pembrokeshire.\n\nOne of his projects, Hendy, near Llandrindod, was turned down by a planning inspector, but that decision was surprisingly overturned by Lesley Griffiths, who was at the time Energy, Planning and Rural Affairs Secretary in Corruption Bay.\n\nTo do that was strange enough. But it stank even more when it became clear that Griffiths did it just in time for the developer to erect a single turbine (never connected to the grid), in order to meet the Ofgem payment deadline on January 31, 2019.\n\nThose involved even seemed to know about Griffiths’ decision in advance, to the extent of jumping the gun.\n\nHere’s a recent update on Hendy from the CPRW.\n\nWhy did Lesley Griffiths give permission for a wind farm that was never going to be built? The answer is a 10-letter word beginning with ‘c’.\n\nAs I say, the guy involved was Steven John Radford, of Hendy Wind Farm Ltd. But he was only fronting for a big company called U+I.\n\nThe reason Bute got a mention was, and here I quote from that November 2018 piece:\n\nIn September Radford branched out again with Bute Energy Ltd, joining six days after its two founding directors.\n\nThose two directors were Millican and Steele, who we’ve already met. Radford may have been their introduction to Wales. (Bute Energy Ltd was re-named RSCO 3750 Ltd in March 2020.)\n\nOr maybe the key lies with whoever introduced them to each other. So let’s fit a few things into that time-frame.\n\nRadford was already planning wind farms, and lobbying for him was Invicta Public Affairs of Newcastle. Invicta’s representative in Wales since October 2016 had been Labour Spad Anna McMorrin, now MP for Cardiff North.\n\nThe Bute Boys linked up with Radford, and Taylor might have taken over McMorrin’s role providing a link between developers and Labour party. A different Scottish source told me last year that Taylor has now been replaced by Sophie Howe, the former Future Generations Commissioner.\n\nHere’s a table I drew up of some essential facts, with links. You might find it useful.\n\nAmong those who get a mention in the table are the four below. Vaughan is a former Labour MEP, and Uden is the husband of Labour MS Jenny Rathbone. For some reason you won’t find the panel below on the Bute website any longer.\n\nAnd even though McMorrin never seemed to work for Bute before becoming an MP in June 2017, she nevertheless declared £3,000 received from Bute earlier this year.\n\nThroughout this story I’ve been struck by how often Newcastle crops up. It’s the city where Parabola began life. ‘Bute’ companies have used Newcastle addresses. And Invicta, the lobbyist we encountered with Anna McMorrin, is also based there.\n\nAnd there are a number of Parabola outfits using a Newcastle address.\n\nBut Invicta also has an office in Edinburgh, the city where we usually find Millican Jr, Steele, and George.\n\nSomething else worth remembering is that Lesley Griffiths and David Taylor know each other. They’re from the same area, here’s a photo of Taylor canvassing for Griffiths. Both had been involved in the Carl Sargeant tragedy.\n\nWhat we looked at earlier in Scotland seems to be repeated to some degree with what we’ve seen in Wales.\n\nOn the one hand, we saw Millican and his mates do a lucrative deal with the Scottish Government. Here, Bute Energy has been adopted by the so-called ‘Welsh Government’.\n\nIn Scotland, a local government pension fund stepped in to buy Titan Warehouse for perhaps double what it was worth. Here there’s been a big investment from the Wales Pension Partnership. With some councils unhappy with the decision.\n\nIs this all coincidence?\n\n◊\n\nWHAT NEXT?\n\nSomething worth remembering about Bute is that for all the companies, and all the wind farm projects, Bute has never erected a single bloody turbine. Perhaps because those involved are property speculators.\n\nWhich is why some people – and I’ve been one of them – think that Bute is not here to actually build wind farms. Maybe they’re just here to get exclusivity agreements with landowners and planning permissions.\n\nThen sell up, making massive profits, without having done much other than smooch Labour politicians and sponsor Cwmscwt Annual Ferret Show.\n\nBut because there are now so many wind farm projects planned in Wales it can only be a matter of time before we see developers fighting turf wars. Maybe it’s started.\n\nTake the case of Foel Fach and Orddu, just north of Bala.\n\nFoel Fach Wind Farm Ltd, the company, was set up May 31, 2022. Head honcho is David Charles Murray. Orddu is a Bute project, the company formed a year later.\n\nMurray got a mention on this blog back in October 2020 in, ‘Poor Wales: magnet for property spivs, fraudsters, and enviroshysters‘. I mentioned him due to his connection with the project between Port Talbot and Maesteg known as Y Bryn.\n\nBut Murray has been involved with many wind farm projects, and his main vehicle seems to be Coriolis Energy Ltd. It has a very basic website, and here’s the Companies House filing. Coriolis Energy is owned by Coriolis Energy Developments LLP. But again, that’s David Charles Murray.\n\nY Bryn Wind Farm Ltd shares a Berkshire address with Coriolis.\n\nWhen we look at who’s behind Foel Fach, we see again Coriolis Energy Developments LLP and David Charles Murray.\n\nThe map on the left shows the relative positions of the Foel Fach and Orddu summits. The map on the right gives the outline of the Foel Fach wind farm.\n\nBut this is where it gets a bit messy.\n\nFor a start, I can’t find a map for Orddu, so where will it end and Foel Fach begin? Are they contiguous? Do they overlap? Or are they two names for what will be one big site?\n\nWe’ve always been told there must be a ‘buffer zone’ between wind farms and National Parks. But Foel Fach runs right up to the Eryri boundary on the B4501. Who allowed this?\n\nIncidentally, the ‘lake’ to the left on that map is the Tryweryn reservoir covering Capel Celyn. And Foel Fach wind farm will also overlook Frongoch, where Irish prisoners were interned after 1916.\n\nAnd finally . . . I believe David Charles Murray of Coriolis is Scottish. Many of his other projects have been in Scotland. So are he and the Bute boys acquainted?\n\nWind farm developments in Wales are out of control, it’s a free-for-all. Planning permission guaranteed; no matter how ugly, inappropriate, or damaging the project. Wales already has too many wind farms (and too many pylons), we don’t need any more.\n\nAnd because it appears we’re in this mess due to questionable links between wind farm developers and the Labour party, a thorough and impartial examination of such links is surely the best way to proceed.\n\nBeing the transparent and co-operative organisation it is, and with nothing to hide, I’m sure the Labour party will agree.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nLet me start by explaining that the title does not refer to the sad buggers in forgotten communities who vote Labour out of force of habit, nor the careerists they vote for.\n\nI’m dealing with those who bring city streets to a standstill waving terrorist flags and shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Antifa, BLM, and all the other representatives of grievance politics.\n\nAnd the Quixotic beings forever battling ‘fascists’ and ‘transphobes’, ‘climate deniers’ and ‘Islamophobes’. Those who think the white man is genetically evil.\n\n◊\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\n\nI’d considered writing something along these lines for a while, but the trigger for what you’re about to read was something that happened a week ago.\n\nI put out a post on X that linked to Google maps to show the heat island around the Senedd, with nary a blade of grass to be seen near the building whose denizens want to plant trees everywhere . . . preferably on what today are working farms. It struck me as mildly hypocritical.\n\nAmong the responses was one from someone called Ben Wildsmith.\n\nHe seemed to suggest that vegetation does not grow near the sea. Making the marram grass of my childhood summers in Port Eynon a false memory. The palms lining tropical beaches, and trees running down to more northern shorelines, must be equally imaginary.\n\nSo I got to wondering about Ben Wildsmith.\n\nLet’s give some background for what’s coming. At the Trump assassination attempt one man died after shielding his wife and daughter from the shooter, His name was Corey Comperatore, aged 50, and he was a firefighter.\n\nIn one of those theatrical gestures that Americans seem to like, Donald Trump, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, kissed the fire helmet of the dead man.\n\nWhich prompted Ben Wildsmith to put out this post on X. The message reads: ‘Yer Da kisses dead men’s helmets’.\n\n‘Yer Da’ is Scouse for ‘your father’, and the rest is a crude reference to a human penis. However you think about it, it’s distasteful. I mean, is it addressed to Trump’s children? Or is it something really, really clever that’ll be understood by leftist necrophiliacs?\n\nThat helmet belonged to a man who put his life on the line in the job he did, and then gave that life to save his wife and daughter. Doesn’t he deserve better?\n\nWell, no – because he was a Trump supporter. That means he can be ‘othered’, and vilified. Because that’s how too many in the modern left think. Including the brainwashed young man who tried to kill Trump. And this nutter.\n\nReminding us that those who urge ‘tolerance’ are often the most dangerously intolerant.\n\nThey suffer a kind of tunnel vision; which is never a good thing, unless perhaps you’re in a tunnel. But as long as sufferers stick together, they see no problem.\n\nTake the July 4 general election. There were people in Wales celebrating a Tory-free Wales as if that was going to make everything better. Of course it won’t; but these people are so fixated on the Conservatives being the source of all evil that they’re incapable of seeing the truth.\n\nWales has had 25 years of socialist rule from Corruption Bay and it’s been disastrous. But everything’s gonna be fine now – because we’ve got no Tory MPs!\n\nBen Wildsmith was one of those rejoicing, in his Nation.Cymru column. Yes, Ben writes for that site funded by the ‘Welsh Government’. Ben also likes to think of himself as a poet and a musician.\n\n◊\n\nLOST\n\nI believe the left in the Anglosphere started losing its way in the late 1970s. The answer to human misery was certainly losing ground in the UK then (partly due to over-reach), and this culminated in the Winter of Discontent.\n\nWhich helped Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives get elected in May 1979. Her position was then strengthened by an unlikely combination of an Argentine military junta invading some islands nobody’d heard of, and the antics of the extreme left.\n\nIn the USA, Democrat Jimmy Carter won the presidency in 1976, but was not re-elected due to his administrations’s perceived weakness over the US hostages taken in Tehran. Republican Ronald Regan won the presidency in 1980, and was re-elected in 1984.\n\nTo cap it all, after years of obvious decline, but also thanks to a collapsing economy, and a costly and unpopular military intervention in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union started falling apart in 1988/89.\n\nThis was crucial, so it’s worth considering how the end of Soviet Communism affected politics in the West. Or certainly, this is how I see it.\n\nOn the one hand, the US military-industrial complex had grown rich and powerful by holding up the Soviet bloc as an existential threat.\n\nBut in his farewell address in January 1961, less than three years before his successor, John F Kennedy, was assassinated, outgoing president Dwight D Eisenhower, warned:\n\n. . . guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence . . . by the military-industrial complex\n\nWith the Soviet empire gone, those Ike warned against were left almost without a raison d’etre.\n\nBut with China not yet powerful enough to be a credible replacement there was little alternative but to stick with Russia. The regime had changed, but post-Communist Russia still had all those nuclear warheads. And a space programme.\n\nWhich posed a problem for the left, because since 1917 many socialists in the West had looked to Russia for inspiration, even orders.\n\nRemarkably, the left, traditionally critical of US foreign policy in Latin America, Vietnam and elsewhere, eventually fell in with military-industrial complex thinking.\n\nThis was achieved because many leftists began to regard the new Russia under Yeltsin, and then Putin, as a betrayal. And when Putin came all out for nation, church, family, tradition, the left turned on him.\n\nWhen he banned gay marriage the comrades became apoplectic.\n\nPutin’s position on these matters also made him a target for the Globalists, who ridicule religion (but only Christianity), and seek to undermine the family unit, erase national differences, and destroy Western traditions.\n\nThis led to a fear among both Globalists and the military-industrial complex that the new Russia might serve as a dangerous example to the West. This became another reason to treat Russia as the enemy, and to villainise Putin.\n\nAnd so it was full speed ahead to NATO encirclement of Russia, EU enlargement, the 2014 Kiev coup, provoke war in Ukraine and . . . I wonder what comes next?\n\nSomething else that must be understood about the collapse of the Soviet Union is that it killed off any lingering belief in the Communist economic model. It just didn’t work. Few saw that more clearly than the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nThe lesson for ‘our’ socialists was that their war against the corrupt and evil West would need to take a different form. Which meant cultural Marxism; initially the relatively benign ‘political correctness’, with this softening-up process leading to the mind-numbing idiocies of Wokeism that followed.\n\nYet Russia in the early 1990s, with its vodka-loving president, and gangsters fighting over state assets, was a bit of a shambles. In the public mind it was not perceived as the same threat as its superpower predecessor.\n\nOther ‘threats’ were needed as a supporting cast.\n\n◊\n\nFOUND\n\nIn the UK, the initial cleansing under leader Neil Kinnock wasn’t enough to win Labour the general elections of 1987 and 1992. A complete re-brand was needed, and it came with Tony Blair and New Labour which, after victory in 1997, stayed in power until 2010.\n\nNew Labour was a kind of Margaret Thatcher tribute band.\n\nIn the USA, the left seemed to be largely incorporated into the Democratic Party, and to some extent de-fanged.\n\nThe collapse and disintegration of the Soviet empire, and with it the removal of a unifying focus for Western concerns, was also a problem for supranational bodies that like to influence public perceptions and political decisions.\n\nThe answer they came up with was ‘global warming’, or ‘climate change’. This racket fulfils an almost identical role to the Cold War; because as well as focusing minds and frightening people, it’s used to dictate human behaviour, curb individual freedoms, and satisfy corporate greed.\n\nAnd when it came to more immediate military ‘threats’, well there was a theatre company of sociopaths out there with dodgy moustaches . . . and oil. To raise the curtain, and stress the importance of oil, Saddam Hussein conveniently invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nAnd as we soon learned from US and UK spokesmen, Saddam had Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). People who knew that to be a lie were helped to commit ‘suicide’.\n\nPerhaps Saddam felt encouraged to invade after the US had funded and armed his bloody war with Iran from 1980 to 1988. Done, not because the Americans had any liking for him, but because the Ayatollahs had deposed their Shah in 1979. And of course, as payback for the hostage crisis that so embarrassed the USA and brought down the peanut farmer from Georgia.\n\n(Though rumours persist that certain US agencies dragged their feet over the hostages in order to make Carter look bad, and help former CIA boss George H W Bush get elected. What a thought!)\n\nThese forays into the lands of oil initially wrong-footed the left. Normally, the comrades would oppose Western powers invading countries over natural resources. But Saddam Hussein Al-Tikriti was a difficult bloke to defend.\n\nSo by 2010 the left is onside with the thinking of the military-industrial complex agenda, has bought into the Globalists’ climate scam, and is open to adopting any lunacy that can be deployed to challenge Western values and institutions.\n\nWith a Conservative government returned in 2010 the left felt it was time to flex its muscles again.\n\n◊\n\nRE-PURPOSED\n\nIn the USA, blue collar workers and southern whites had been switching to the Republicans for some time. And this continued under Obama.\n\nWhile in the UK, many lower-paid workers had lost their fear of voting Tory with Margaret Thatcher, some moving to even more ‘exotic’ destinations on the right.\n\nWhich meant that Labour and Democrats needed to replace these lost voters. In the USA there was a push to register more voters from minority groups. But that took a dangerous turn when the left started arguing that to ask voters for ID was ‘racist’.\n\nNow, in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, we’ve seen Democrats demand that undocumented, illegal migrants be allowed to vote.\n\nThe thinking behind this is pretty obvious.\n\nThe military-industrial complex may have taken shape to further US imperial ambitions and enrich US corporations, but it soon spread its influence to UK politics, and NATO.\n\nFor as Tom Paxton put it in Daily News:\n\nBan the bombers are afraid of a fight\n\nPeace hurts business and that ain’t right\n\nAt its simplest . . . corporate America gains from making the weapons for the military. The quicker the products are used, and replaced, then the bigger the profits.\n\nBut the military-industrial complex also profits from ‘rebuilding’ the countries wrecked by the weapons it’s produced.\n\nThis report from 2005 explains how Halliburton did it in Iraq. And with the fighting still taking its bloody toll along the Dnieper BlackRock and JPMorgan have been quick off the mark to set up a Ukraine Reconstruction Bank.\n\nGlobalist corporations profiting from a war the USA engineered in order to support the most corrupt regime in Europe. What’s more, Ukraine’s been corrupt for a long time.\n\nAs I’ve reported before, the head of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, wants “governments, businesses and non-governmental organizations” to have the power of compulsory purchase over farms and other private property.\n\nShould that happen, then WWW, or Radnorshire Wildlife Trust, or even Bute Energy, could throw you off your land, or out of your home – to save the planet.\n\nWhen they’re not supporting the US military-industrial complex and the most corrupt country in Europe, the comrades are promoting the Globalist land grab agenda of Jamie Dimon and his buddies.\n\nAs I’ve said before, 2016 saw the process ratcheted up because, through Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, the lower orders had proven themselves to be both stupid and racist. The gloves were off.\n\nWhich is why we are where we are. And seeing the West so weak, socialists may think their time has finally come. But I believe their time has come, and gone.\n\nThe entitled, attention-seeking clowns, with their half-baked ideas, have become an embarrassment. Certainly Ed Miliband thinks so. The days of performance socialism may be coming to an end. People have had enough.\n\n◊\n\nFINISHED\n\nMiliband is close to those hoping to benefit from net zero, carbon capture, and all the other elements of the climate scam. So he may not just be speaking for himself.\n\nBut anyway, it’s not just Miliband, there are other signs that something is changing. Just look around. Can’t you smell it!\n\nThere are governments in Europe hanging on for dear life, dreading the next election. The UK has a government with no real mandate. France seems to be falling apart. The West is being flooded with ‘refugees’ who are nothing of the sort. Following an assassination attempt on the man likely to be the next US president, there was a palace coup to remove the incumbent!\n\nAll because people are waking up to the truths. They know they’ve been lied to in so many ways, and for too long. Those who’ve lied to us are getting worried.\n\nChange is inevitable. Possibly major change.\n\nFinally following Ike’s advice and reining in the military-industrial complex, curbing the power of the Globalists, and dealing with the clowns who serve their agendas without realising it, is the best hope for a just, peaceful, and prosperous world.\n\nBut if it’s too late and the worst happens; then when you see that mushroom cloud, you can at least console yourself by knowing there are no Tory MPs in Wales.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nI suppose I could have done a piece on Vaughan Gething’s belated resignation; but I’ve said almost all I want to say on that nice Mr Musk’s platform. He’s moving to Texas, you know. (Musk, not Gething.)\n\nI will just add that Gething’s resignation speech was a classic of ‘Welsh’ Labour. He took no responsibility whatsoever for his fate; the mistakes, the errors of judgement, the lies, being an arrogant prick, no – it was all somebody else’s fault!\n\nAnd of course, he was the victim of racism. Ideas of victimhood, and exploiting it, are now so embedded in the Labour party in Wales that they direct policy and legislation. As you’ll read in the third section of this offering.\n\nWhich is a Miscellany! A section on Woodknowledge Wales, yet another gang of enviro-shysters. Part three is on yet more tinkering by the ‘Welsh Government’ with the democratic process. And finally, some thoughts on wind turbines, and pylons.\n\n◊\n\nWOOD YOU BELIEVE IT!\n\nAn outfit that’s been in the news lately is Woodknowledge Wales (WKW). It encourages greater use of wood. I quote: “We champion the development of wood-based industries for increased prosperity and well-being in Wales“.\n\n‘Well-being‘! That meaningless term used to justify anything and everything.\n\nI have no issue with timber-framed buildings, or even buildings made entirely of wood. The issue is the politics, the funding, the peripheral messages and hidden agendas that always attach to outfits like WKW.\n\nSo who runs this show, and where might we find them?\n\nLooking through the early directors of what was originally the Welsh Timber Forum I saw a few names I recognised, in fact, people I know personally. But there seems to have been a kind of takeover in 2016.\n\nOf the six directors at the start of 2017, two have since left. The four remaining directors – of what converted to a Community Benefit Society (CBS) on St Patrick’s Day 2022 – all joined in 2016.\n\nThe two departures may even have been connected with the change to a CBS. Strangely, perhaps, of the 36 directors who’ve come and gone since 2001 those two were the only ones to describe themselves on the Companies House listings as ‘Welsh’.\n\nBelow you see the current WKW directors from the latest accounts (to 31.03.2023) filed with the Financial Conduct Authority. Also the companies they run or, in the case of Rachel Moxie, the day job. This filing still uses the address of one of the departed.\n\nThough I’m unclear on the status of Gary Newman. He was a director when WKW was a company, yet he’s signed the most recent accounts from the FCA as secretary.\n\nBut if Newman is now WKW secretary, rather than a director, this would explain why he isn’t listed as being a director of The Foundational Economy Alliance Wales Ltd.\n\nThis lot moved in November 2022 from the United Welsh housing association offices in Caerffili to an address in Porthaethwy (Menai Bridge), which is quite a move.\n\nHowever, the new address for WKW, the one given on the website, is 22 Cathedral Road in Cardiff. (Possibly out back.) Also known as Pentan House, for at this address we also find, Pentan, Rant Media, Moxie People, LRM Planning, The Green Business Centre, and who knows who else?\n\nWith Woodknowledge Wales we have another outfit serving the ‘Welsh Government’s self-destructive obeisance to the Net Zero cult. With councils and housing associations made to use more wood in their new builds.\n\nMuch of which will be from timber grown by foreign corporations on what used to be Welsh family farms. Or wood from monoculture plantations poisoning land and water.\n\nThe role I suggest for WKW would explain the presence on The Board of Shayne Hembrow of Corruption Bay’s favourite housing association.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive / Commercial Director of Wales and West Housing Association . . . In addition Shayne is chair of Shelter Cymru and Chair of Woodknowledge Wales.\n\nHembrow is yet another third sector grifter who came to Wales to help third-rate politicians wreck our country. But I can’t see him listed on the W&W website. Has he gone undercover?\n\nIn the FCA filings we see only Hughes, Meade and Moxey named as directors. So does this mean that Godefroy, Healy and Hembrow joined more recently? And why is Godefroy described in her bio as a “trustee“, for WKW isn’t a registered charity?\n\nFinally, and in what seems to be a recurring theme, we have with Woodknowledge Wales a group close to if not controlled by Corruption Bay . . . with one of those involved getting loans from the Development Bank of Wales.\n\nIn the case of director Jasper Meade, in January 2020, he landed two loans from DBW Investments (14). One specific to a factory in Buttington, near Welshpool; the other, a more general charge over a number of his companies.\n\nAs I say, a recurring theme. Which is why I suggest the Development Bank of Wales needs to be investigated, and then taken away from the control of politicians.\n\n∼\n\nAll that said, I could still support this push to use more wood if I thought it would result in a forestry industry employing thousands of people in rural areas, sustaining Welsh communities, complementing farming rather than being used to destroy it.\n\nBut that won’t happen. It’ll be like renewable energy, environmentalism, 20mph, and all the other results of politicians buying into the climate cult and the control agenda.\n\n◊\n\nBYE-BYE, PORT TALBOT\n\nLet’s stick with Woodknowledge Wales (WKW) for just a minute. They’ve been pushing a report, ‘Serious About Green?—Building a Welsh wood economy through co-ordination‘.\n\nThis makes it clear – as I suggested earlier – that WKW is not simply concerned with us using more wood in buildings. The agenda is much bigger.\n\nAnd while the report itself seems to be the work of WISERD, the quote below is from Woodknowledge Wales, and can be found here.\n\nWales is a sheep, beef and dairy nation and Wales is a steel nation. These activities are deeply ingrained in our cultural identity. They may have been rational activities for the past century but are not well-aligned to the low carbon needs of 21st Century Welsh society.\n\nWe must give up good-pay steel jobs and the Welsh family farm. And we must do so because a bunch of zealots have decided that we who belong here, working in our own country, in spheres they disapprove of, must lose everything.\n\n◊\n\nUNIVERSAL FRANCHISE . . . AND THEN SOME!\n\nNow we’re going to consider the Elections and Elected Bodies (Wales) Bill. Here’s a shorter summary. And this is how WalesOnline reported it last week.\n\nYou’ll see that everyone is to be put on the electoral register whether they want to be on it or not. Speaking for the Electoral Reform Society, chief executive Darren Hughes had this to say:\n\nAutomatic voter registration is a win-win for voters as it takes one more thing off their to-do list while also . . . helping to enfranchise the hundreds of thousands of missing voters in Wales.\n\nWhich is, as we psephologists are wont to say, and at the risk of sounding technical, utter bollocks.\n\n“Takes one more thing off their to-do list“, says Kiwi Darren. But what if it was never on their to-do list? There are thousands of people in Wales who have chosen not to be on the electoral register.\n\nConsequently, to put them on the register, without their permission, will be an infringement of their privacy and an assault on their freedoms.\n\nAs well as bulking up the electoral rolls the Bill also references candidates, and inevitably, we find ‘diversity’ mentioned. Here’s what the summary says on page 5.\n\n“Specific characteristics” is code for trans, as the ‘Welsh Government’ now shies away from using the legally incorrect and deliberately misleading ‘protected’. But it also introduces a new term with “socio-economic circumstances“? Does that mean preference will be given to poor people?\n\nIt’s worth asking, because the summary then takes a rather curious twist when it talks of “financial assistance“.\n\n(Is Section 29 written correctly, or should it read, ‘specified characteristics’?)\n\nFor me, the mention of disability is a distraction, for most beneficiaries of this largesse will in fact come from other groups.\n\nI expect race and a certain religion to figure, but there may be another clue here.\n\nWelsh Ministers may provide financial assistance schemes to help candidates in Welsh elections that have specific characteristics or specified circumstances overcome barriers to participation.\n\nI went to the full version of the Bill in the hope of finding “specified circumstances” explained. But there was nothing. Leaving me to think the Labour party will sponsor candidates from certain categories on whose loyalty it can count.\n\nPutting everyone on the electoral register only makes sense if we have compulsory voting. But we don’t, and I’m not aware of any plans to introduce it. So why put everyone on the electoral register?\n\nHere’s another concern. This legislation might be in place for the 2026 Senedd elections, which means it will complement the Senedd Cymru (Electoral Candidates Lists) Bill. Yes, that’s the one giving us huge constituencies and closed lists.\n\nIn the WalesOnline article you’ll see mentioned Mick Antoniw, the Counsel General. Now I have concerns about this man’s role in elections.\n\nMainly because of his involvement in pushing through the closed lists system. I dealt with it in my piece Senedd Cymru (Electoral Candidate Lists) Bill. There I explained that Antoniw was even trying to get away with not naming candidates!\n\nThe electoral systems of Wales and the UK are screwed up enough without making things worse.\n\nConsider, Labour has just won a landslide victory in the July 4 general election. But it was only a landslide in terms of seats, and entirely due to the peculiarities of the FPTP system. The turnout was well down on recent elections.\n\nThe problem – in addition to the Gething factor and the failure of devolution – is that too many people don’t feel engaged by politics, or feel that politicians don’t speak for them.\n\nThe priority should therefore be engaging with those who are already on the electoral registers but don’t vote. Because it makes no sense to register people who have no intention of voting.\n\nOne change we’ve already seen was the requirement on July 4 for those wanting to vote to produce photographic ID. Now as we know, from the USA and elsewhere, such a rule is racist, and so would never have been introduced by Labour.\n\nFor Labour is far more ‘flexible’ when it comes to rules relating to voting.\n\nWhich is why I predict that, in addition to putting everybody’s name on the electoral register, we shall also see moves to make postal and proxy voting easier.\n\nIn the 2026 Senedd elections we could see un-named Labour candidates, with “specified characteristics” and “specified circumstances“, benefit from “financial assistance” . . . and be elected in turnouts of 127%.\n\nTry to argue then that democracy’s in trouble!\n\nThe truth is that once again we see Labour introducing dangerous divisions and dubious methods to serve its own narrow political interests.\n\n◊\n\nLINKS TO THE OLD NORTH\n\nMany of you must be aware of Bute Energy’s plans for a pylon run some 60 miles long from that company’s wind farms in Powys south through the Tywi valley to Llandyfaelog, south of Carmarthen.\n\nThere the line from Powys will connect with the line from Pembroke to England. For of course virtually all the power generated in Wales goes to England. (Thankfully, we get the thousands of excellent jobs provided by ‘renewables’.)\n\nThe project is being handled by Bute’s Green Gen Cymru. And it’s explained, sort of, here, and if you scroll down there’s even an interactive map.\n\nAs might be expected, there is considerable opposition along the route.\n\nAnd the plan is severely testing the loyalties of some politicians. (Also, their mental dexterity.) For example, Ann Davies, the new Plaid Cymru MP for Caerfyrddin, has said she opposes the pylons . . . but not the wind turbines.\n\nI don’t want to spend too much time on the Tywi valley project because it’s really just the intro to the other elements of this section.\n\nAs I say, roughly half of the electricity generated in Wales goes to England, and the amount will increase if all the planned wind farms get built. The situation is similar in Scotland, with electricity generated there having even further to travel to consumers in central and southern England. (With power being lost in transmission.)\n\nAnd although it’s been reported once or twice, I’m not sure how many people are aware of the planned new Scottish connection. In a nutshell, it’s proposed that electricity generated off south west Scotland will be taken by undersea cable to Pentir, near Bangor, and then overland to Swansea North substation.\n\nI’d like to be able to show you a map of the route, but there isn’t one, all I’ve seen is a vague line from Bangor to Swansea . . . through Eryri. Which obviously isn’t going to happen.\n\nIn this CPRW article Dr Jonathan Dean has this to say.\n\nThe route of this line is not yet known, despite me asking them numerous times. As they will not get consent for pylons in Eryri national park they basically have two options:\n\nalong the north coast to Conwy, up the Conwy valley, past Bala then down to the Tywi valley to Swansea\n\nacross the top of Pen Llŷn to Porthmadog, subsea to near Aberystwyth then cross country to Swansea\n\nWhich could mean the pylons coming down the Teifi valley, where there is already a campaign fighting Bute pylons. This Bute line will carry electricity from Lan Fawr, east of Llanddewi Brefi. I assume it will also serve Blaencothi and Nant Ceiment.\n\nThen the pylons will also run down to Llandyfaelog. But will they share the line coming from Powys, or will there be two pylon runs past Llandeilo? And will they interfere with the route of the planned bypass?\n\nHowever you look at it, lovely Ystrad Tywi is in for a forest of steel pylons marching for mile after mile over hill and dale. Each one sunk in hundreds of tons of concrete. And all done to save the environment, innit?\n\n∼\n\nThe reason that Scotland and Wales have despoiled landscapes in order to generate electricity for England, is partly due to their politicians buying into the climate scam, and partly due to the difficulty of building onshore wind farms in England.\n\nThe latter due to different laws that allowed communities affected by such projects to object and, effectively, block them. But the law is changing.\n\nClearly, if onshore windfarms can in future be built in England, where the power is needed, there’ll be less need to erect windfarms in Wales. In fact, the need might be removed entirely.\n\nIt seems obvious to me that many of the mooted projects won’t now be needed. And that might include the pylon runs in the Teifi and Tywi valleys, even the big one from Bangor to Swansea.\n\nAnd seeing as Bute Energy has yet to erect a single turbine, I think the ‘Welsh Government’ should call a halt to onshore wind projects in order to assess how the new legislation in England might impact on Wales.\n\nWe don’t want the ‘Welsh Government’ (via NRW) felling tens of thousands of trees, allowing hundreds of 800ft wind turbines, and hundreds of miles of pylons, if nobody wants to buy the electricity they erratically produce.\n\nWe’ll just have to live without the thousands of £70,000 pa jobs they’d have created.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nI decided to put this out soon after making up my mind not to bother with an analysis of the general election result. Only in a FPTP system could a party get a massive majority from a reduced share of the vote. A system designed for Whigs and Tories to fight over rotten boroughs is obviously broken.\n\n◊\n\nMIND-BENDING BOLLOCKS, CITIZENS’ ASSEMBLIES, MORE BOLLOCKS\n\nThis piece took life with an article in Nation.Cymru last Thursday entitled, ‘Climate inaction undermines public support for lifestyle changes‘. A strange title, but when you think about it, it’s revealing.\n\nThe suggestion is that because the decision-makers are not doing enough to tackle the ‘climate crisis’ we, the public, are failing to support the lifestyle changes deemed necessary to combat said ‘climate crisis’.\n\nThe article begins:\n\nNew research into the public perception of climate change initiatives finds that whilst there is strong support for low-carbon lifestyles inaction is limiting public beliefs that a low-carbon future is possible.\n\nWhich is absolute bollocks. Outside of OPD circles there’s no ‘strong support for low carbon lifestyles’.\n\nOr rather, support may exist, but only in the abstract. For in the real world, eating, heating, travelling, at reasonable cost, win out every time over the draconian and expensive measures proposed to achieve net zero.\n\nThe N.C article quotes Dr Catherine Cherry, of Cardiff University’s School of Psychology and the Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations (CAST).\n\nThough I’m not sure if Dr Cherry’s really in Cardiff, and if she is, then I’m fairly sure she’s not teaching. Her Linkedin page locates her in Liverpool, but says she’s with CAST at Cardiff University. How does that work?\n\nCall me an old cynic, but here’s how I read it. We, mere hoi polloi, need to be ‘persuaded’ that climate change is happening in order to accept the expensive, behaviour-changing, and freedom-limiting measures demanded of us by the Globalists.\n\nBut how is the voice of Dai Public to be heard? The N.C article recommends that old favourite – Citizens’ Assemblies.\n\nWe suggest involving the public in co-creating positive and fair visions of a sustainable future through deliberative processes like Citizens’ Assemblies. This could help build a public mandate for climate policies and foster a sense of climate citizenship, weakening the discourse of delay.\n\nAnyone who’s been paying attention will know that Citizens’ Assemblies are as representative of genuine public opinion as a Question Time audience. In practice, citizens’ assemblies are stuffed with activists who tell other activists and politicians what they want to hear.\n\nWhat those involved might perceive as a virtuous circle; others as an echo chamber.\n\nAs Dr Cherry is involved with the CAST, that’s where we head next.\n\n◊\n\nCENTRE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nThere’s something very 1984-ish about ‘social transformations’, don’t you think? Rather like ‘nudge unit’ Lynn Global and their ‘Behavioural Sciences’ (BS) work for the so-called ‘Welsh Government’.\n\nCAST looks like another gang of Greta-worshippers agonising over the rest of us. We inconsiderate bastards driving cars, having kids, eating meat . . . basically, just breathing.\n\nAlso at CAST we find Lorraine Whitmarsh MBE. Linkedin tells us she was also at Cardiff University, until July 2020. And she seems to have been a lecturer.\n\nAnd although she’s left Wales for Bath University, Whitmarsh was last year recruited by the Wales Net Zero 2035 Challenge Group. Below is her entry on the WNZ2035 website.\n\nI wonder if her ‘studies of meat consumption’ concluded we should eat more?\n\nProfessor Whitmarsh’s CV might appear to be that of an academic, and nothing more, but I suggest caution because, in addition to her links with the highly suspect IPCC, this BBC article from March 2019 tells us:\n\nA new £5m research centre led by Cardiff University’s psychology department, which will explore new ways to tackle climate change, has also been announced.\n\nProf Lorraine Whitmarsh, who will head up the unit, said it would “address the fundamental question of how we can live differently and better, in ways that meet the need for these systemic, deep and rapid emission reductions”.\n\nAgain, note that it’s the psychology department exploring “new ways to tackle climate change“. What can psychology do even if there is a climate crisis?\n\nIt’s explained in the following paragraph. And I think we know what is meant by, “live differently and better“. This is another reference to the ‘social transformations’ we read about earlier.\n\nIn reality, we are expected to live differently, but it won’t be better. Not for us.\n\nThis new department at Cardiff University seems to be a collaboration with CAST, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), which is part of UK Research and Innovation.\n\nSo we have a department at Cardiff University, where psychologists are funded by the UK government to, among other things, advise the ‘Welsh Government’ on how to make us behave differently in response to a claimed ‘climate crisis’.\n\nHere’s a final contribution from CAST, which is one of those bodies pushing the idiocy that the countryside is racist, and introduces race into the climate debate with:\n\nPeople of colour in the UK are disproportionately affected by climate change impacts.\n\nIt’s nonsense, obviously. Yet another attempt by leftist academics to introduce race into just about every discussion. (A guaranteed route to funding.)\n\nBefore leaving that 2019 BBC article I must comment on the contribution from former first minister, Mark Drakeford:\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the younger generation recognised a failure to act “could have catastrophic consequences for their futures”.\n\nWe are talking now of brainwashed young people. Here’s how it works.\n\nSix-year-olds, after being traumatised by drag queens flaunting their junk and telling them they’re in the wrong bodies, are further terrified by hearing the world will end in the very near future – and it’s all the fault of their wicked parents and grandparents!\n\nPoliticians then claim to be surprised and horrified by levels of ‘climate anxiety’ among young people. As if the inevitable consequence of brainwashing can be divorced from the brainwashing itself.\n\nThis is disgusting hypocrisy. Even for a Labour politician.\n\n◊\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nIf that establishment’s name rings a bell it’s because about 15 years ago someone released a stash of e-mails suggesting that people involved with the Climate Research Unit there had been ‘imaginative’ with their findings.\n\nInevitably, those with a vested interest in promoting the climate scam – and of course their media – circled the wagons and dismissed the claims as smears made by ‘climate deniers’. (Who denies climate?)\n\nThe BBC even made a drama out of it – 14 years later!\n\nCherry and Whitmarsh were both there at that time.\n\nCherry was doing a MSc in Climate Change, after which she worked for a few months for the Norwich Green Party. While Whitmarsh was a senior research assistant at the University of East Anglia from April 2005 until March 2009.\n\nI’m not suggesting that either was involved in fiddling the figures, or indeed that fiddling took place; but there is a cloud hanging over the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia from that period.\n\nI mention this because Cherry and Whitmarsh later came to Wales, to Corruption Bay’s favourite university. Also because what happened in Norwich makes us consider what is often referred to as Plato’s ‘Noble Lie’.\n\nWhich is saying things you know to be untrue for (what you perceive to be) the right reasons, or a beneficial outcome. In Plato’s case it seems to have been reminding different classes of their roles in a divinely-ordered system, thereby ensuring the social cohesion of the polis.\n\nSocial cohesion and a sense of belonging are entirely desirable, but today, in the age of Globalism, and its use of Wokery, there is nothing noble about the lies we are fed.\n\nWe are told that white people are uniquely evil. We are told that men can have babies. In fact, we are told all sorts of lies in order to cause confusion, destabilisation and the very opposite of social cohesion.\n\nIn Wales, farmers are blamed for every pollution incident. Blamed by those who covet the farmers’ land. In many cases, those making the claims are lying.\n\nOne example came from Rachel Sharp of the (officially defunct) Wildlife Trusts Wales. In November 2021 she told the Senedd’s Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee that Welsh rivers and streams were awash with growth hormones used by Welsh farmers. Here’s a link to the video.\n\nGrowth hormones have been illegal in the UK since 1981.\n\nThis blatant lie did nothing to damage Sharp’s reputation. For she sits on the ‘Welsh Government’s Hinkley Point C Reference Group. And it should go without saying that she was also recruited to that discredited-in-advance-of-their-‘findings’ gang, the WNZ2035 Challenge Group.\n\nBoth of which are chaired by the Green Goddess, and author of the Future Generations legislation, Jane Davidson.\n\nIf you really believe that farting cows are destroying the planet, or if you’re a zealous vegan, then you’ll have no qualms about lying when it comes to farmers. Especially when politicians are eagerly waiting to accept and act on your lies.\n\nAnd of course, fund your purchase of vacated farms and abandoned farmland.\n\n◊\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf there really was a climate crisis, then the evidence would be enough to make us change our wicked ways. Psychology would not be needed. But there is no real evidence. As ever, in the absence of evidence, we are subjected to ‘imaginative messaging’.\n\nWhich relies on ‘corrected’ records, contemporary temperatures recorded in ‘heat islands’, computer modelling, and influencing organisations such as the Met Office and the BBC into describing sunny days of 20º Celsius as heatwaves. Phew!\n\nSometimes the deception is so obvious it’s laughable. We had a fine example back in 2022 with Matthew Horwood selling his photos of a tidal creek in Pembrokeshire to media outlets as evidence of a dried up river – due to climate change!\n\nRead it here by scrolling down to the section ‘Someone’s Telling Porkies’.\n\nWhat I found instructive about this episode was that even after they’d been told the truth, the media made no corrections to their reports. They allowed the lie to stand, because they wanted to promote the lie.\n\nBut then, I suppose they have to lie because the headline-grabbing predictions made by Al Gore and other charlatans have all failed to materialise.\n\nSnow still caps Kilimanjaro. The Great Barrier Reef is in rude health. Polar bear populations are thriving. People still take holidays on the Seychelles and other islands we were told would disappear under rising sea levels. Deaths from extreme weather events have plummeted.\n\nAll of which explains why people aren’t buying into the ‘climate crisis’ – because it’s just not happening. So those who want us to believe in climate change, in order to control us and our behaviour, must resort to voodoo psychology.\n\nIf that fails, then perhaps it’ll be hypnotism next. I can see it now – The Great Gateso, black top hat and cloak, leggy assistant, inviting volunteers from the audience to be mesmerised into eating his lab-made ‘meat’.\n\nThis is of course encouraging. It tells us the Globalists are losing. But we must remain vigilant against their emissaries in politics, academia, the media, pressure groups and elsewhere trying to make us accept the lies.\n\nLies that are anything but noble.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nThere’s no avoiding it, and I won’t bother trying. So here’s my quick preview of the general election, and my reason for voting for Reform. Not because I support Reform but because I reject the rest.\n\nDon’t worry, I still want independence, but the immediate priority is confronting Globalism. Because an ‘independent’ Wales run from the shadows, a virtue-signalling basket-case begging to join the EU, isn’t worth having.\n\n◊\n\nTHE TITANIC DECKCHAIRS ANALOGY, AGAIN\n\nIn this election I see the political parties as passengers on the Titanic. With the doomed ship heading towards the iceberg they squabble over the arrangement of the deckchairs.\n\nYet when you listen to the ‘deckchair’ parties arguing you realise that, from the wider perspective, it will make hardly any difference which of them wins. Because they all ignore what’s really important – the looming ‘iceberg’.\n\nThankfully, there may be one party that realises where the focus should lie, and that party is Reform. Which is why I shall be voting for Reform on July 4.\n\nI know nothing of my local candidate, I don’t need to. It doesn’t matter to me if he / she has horns, chronic flatulence, and supports Cardiff City.\n\nThat’s because party politics is dead. It is now the Globalists, their media, and their uniparty, versus the rest of us – Them against us, the people.\n\n◊\n\n. . . BUT FEW NOTED ITS PASSING\n\nYou can see that politics is dead when the uniparty stresses minor differences that are barely perceptible; exploiting understandings and interpretations that no longer apply.\n\nDone to hide the fact that both major parties have signed up to The Agenda. Labour because it’s swallowed the nonsense about a ‘climate crisis’, transgenderism, and believes the New World Order offers something better for humanity; the Tories because they’ve always been relaxed about corporate greed.\n\nYou must reject this deception that relies on long gone ideological differences.\n\nThe struggle now is for the Western way of life, national sovereignty, the family, individual freedom, traditional values, biology, and simple common sense.\n\nConfronting us we have political placemen, a bought media, a corrupted education system, assorted activists, all working to weaken the West so that a select group of wealthy, powerful, and increasingly desperate people can take control.\n\nThey’re getting desperate because they can no longer hide. Too many people know about them. Which means more people wanting to thwart their plans.\n\nFor as the recent elections in the EU told us, the ‘iceberg’ is increasingly visible to ordinary people in many countries. This explains traditional parties suffering electoral defeats, and the ‘far-right’ doing so well.\n\nFor while the Globalists have effectively merged ‘mainstream’ parties, giving them supporters on what are still perceived as left and right, real opposition can only come from where we have always found those who believe in the values I earlier listed.\n\nWhich explains why we’re vilified by the Globalist media and other shills as ‘far-right’, or whatever.\n\n◊\n\nTO FOCUS ON WALES\n\nThis election could not have come at a worse time for Labour and Plaid Cymru. Let me explain why.\n\nSince the advent of devolution in 1999, which put the party in control, Labour has taken credit for anything that went right (very little), while blaming ‘London’ / Tories for everything that went wrong (a lot). But you can only get away with this, even in Wales, for so long.\n\nNow, after 25 years of devolution, perhaps even the stupidest among us realise that the NHS is devolved, so is education. Similarly with the cancellation of desperately-needed infrastructure projects, including improvements to the M4.\n\nWith no hope of the kakistocracy pinning the 20mph disaster on anybody else.\n\nWhile in the pipeline is road charging, emission charges, an intensification of the war on farmers, and even more draconian measures serving net zero.\n\nThese are all Globalist policies being pushed harder in Wales because with no successes to claim in areas that matter, the ‘Welsh Government’ thinks that leading the world in ‘saving’ a planet in no danger is the only way they’re going to get a pat on the head from anybody.\n\nIn fact, we’re entering a phase of blatant deception where we’re told to forget crass and selfish material considerations like food on the table, clothes for the kids, and dignity for your elderly parents; we should focus instead on the joys derived from greater diversity, increased toad populations, and just being nice.\n\nThis is what ‘Well-being‘ is really about. Making you accept declining standards across the board in favour of airy-fairy concepts that mean fuck all. And you’re being preached at by people who will go without nothing.\n\nIn the reality from which those clowns have long drifted it means Wales going down the tubes faster than anywhere else.\n\nAs if 25 years of failure wasn’t enough to damage their chances, Labour in Wales also has to worry about Vaughan Gething, their new leader. To begin with, he’s embroiled in a donations scandal; then two of his Senedd Members stayed away and caused him to lose a vote of no confidence, yet he refuses to stand down.\n\nI think that on July 4 Labour in Wales will be judged on their record in Wales to a greater extent than at any election in the past. This can not be good for them.\n\nWhen we turn to Plaid Cymru, Labour’s erstwhile partners in Corruption Bay, we see another party for whom the timing of this general election has not been kind.\n\nPlaid recently disengaged itself from Labour with the 2026 Senedd elections in mind. Done to give them enough time to go in for some gentle sparring that might persuade mug punters they are now in opposition.\n\nThen came the announcement of the general election.\n\nWhich means that in most people’s minds Plaid is still Labour’s little helper, and only slightly less culpable for the horrors of recent years.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, it’s difficult to see Plaid now as anything more than a ship that long ago slipped its moorings; since when it’s been drifting aimlessly, at the mercy of wind and tide.\n\nPlaid Cymru no longer believes in Wales and what makes Wales Welsh. It has swapped it all for an artisanal tote bag stuffed with green-woke-left lunacies. And people can see it.\n\nIn my area, UK elections saw farmers’ fields filled with Plaid Cymru placards. But not this time round. But never mind, Wil is being replaced with Sarah and others of her ilk who see Plaid as an acceptable left wing party.\n\nLooking at LSR in that picture it’s as if Leanne Wood never went away. Then again, maybe performative ‘socialism’ appeals to you; but it’s always left me cold.\n\nThere was a time when the media used to gleefully report ‘extremists’ in Plaid Cymru, I knew some of them. (I was one of them!) Their ‘crime’ was being over-zealous in their patriotism. Plaid now attracts real extremists who don’t give a toss about Wales.\n\n◊\n\nWHY WE MUST STAND UP NOW\n\nSo, yes, I suppose me voting Reform could be seen as a protest vote, but it goes way beyond a traditional protest vote. Because the West is at a crossroads, and we know where we’re heading unless we change course – because they’ve told us!\n\nInto a cold, dark future, with few jobs; our movements restricted and our behaviour and speech monitored. It’s already out there with hate speech laws. And with the EU implementing online censorship.\n\nLet me explain how ‘hate speech’ works. It begins with politicians allowing themselves to be led by groups pushing idiocies like women having penises and men being able to give birth.\n\nEverybody knows these suggestions are biological nonsense. But the left promotes them because it’s a way of kicking back at ‘bourgeois values’, ‘the patriarchy’, even (somehow!) ‘white supremacy’.\n\nLiberals go along with it wanting to be ‘progressive’.\n\nAnd so laws are passed stating biological absurdities. These laws, of themselves, could be dismissed as a bit of harmless fun. But it never ends there. For this legislation empowers freaks, perverts, sexual predators . . . and of course, political activists.\n\nAnd gives governments the power to silence any criticism.\n\nWhich was always the intention.\n\nYour little daughter comes home traumatised because some bloke flashed his penis at her in the swimming pool changing room. You go to the police, complain – and are told, ‘But that’s a female penis, and you’re under arrest for hate speech.’\n\nWe have now arrived at a point where stating the truth has become a crime. This is the totalitarians’ nirvana. The shades of Hitler and Stalin are comparing erections!\n\nAnd censorship doesn’t come alone. It is accompanied by wrecking economies in pursuit of net zero. Arguing that white people are evil, and making them pay for it. And of course, the illegal immigration of unvetted, mainly young males who have no intention of working or integrating.\n\nFor to achieve the objective of destabilising the West the Globalists have recruited environmentalists, Islamists, sexual deviants and God knows what else. And of course, the quisling left, seeking to succeed from within where the Soviet Union failed from without.\n\nNor must we forget Rupert and Clarissa of the dilettante left; who’ll throw paint, stop traffic, and topple statues to prove how frightfully poor and oppressed they are. Yah.\n\nGoes down well with other spoilt brats at Glasto.\n\nEither we troop silently into this dystopian future, or we say no. And at the moment the best way to say no is to vote for political parties the Globalists do not control. Parties like Marine le Pen’s RN (didn’t they do well!), Geert Wilders’ Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, the AfD in Germany, and others across Europe.\n\nFor that’s one thing I’ve noticed in recent years – a growing appreciation of what it means to be European by people who increasingly reject the EU. There’s a powerful message there if you think about it.\n\nFinally, let’s not forget Donald Trump. When he’s elected US President in November he must not make the mistake he made first time round by taking into his camp too many who were not really on his side.\n\nHe must be ruthless from Day One in rooting out the enemies of the USA and the West. A great start would be keeping his promise to release all the JFK assassination files. As a first step in undoing the power of the deep state that has caused so much misery in the USA and around the world.\n\nFor one of the Globalists’ greatest successes has been to manoeuvre leftists and liberals, who so revered JFK, onto the same side as those who killed him.\n\n◊\n\nA MESSAGE TO LABOUR VOTERS\n\nI’m going to end with a message addressed to Labour voters in Blaengwynfi and Bonymaen, the people from whom I am sprung, and with whom I identify.\n\nThe Labour party has always taken your vote for granted, knowing you’d chop your arm off rather than vote Conservative. But times have changed; there’s no difference between them any more. They march to the same drum.\n\nLabour and Conservatives will make you and your communities poorer, both will close Port Talbot steelworks, and both will implement the half-arsed ideas of those attending the Hay Festival rather than listen to the needs of working class people.\n\nAre you going to carry on being the mug who votes Labour?\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nI had considered doing this piece as an update to the one I put out on Tuesday, but there’s too much I want to say, so it has to be done as a second posting. And that wasn’t the only problem.\n\nFor I’d also intended including a reminder about the generosity to Coleg Soros that I reported on in ‘Green Man, Red Herring‘, in May 2022.\n\n◊\n\nTHE BENEFITRIX\n\nI’m referring now to Troed-yr-Harn, the farm that was bought for Coleg Soros back in January 2021. I couldn’t identify the buyer beyond her name, ‘Jenny Mathilde Daneels Watt’, and so I signed off with a request for information.\n\nHere’s a link to the Land Registry title document (no plan, unfortunately), and here’s the link to the title document for a smaller purchase on the same site (with plan).\n\nI’d assumed that Daneels was a Dutch name, and because Watt is usually Scottish, that she’d married a Scotsman.\n\nThe Daneels name is in fact, Flemish, so I wasn’t far off. Though she is a French citizen with an English mother. (Here’s what Linkedin tells us.) While her Scottish husband’s name is David Crichton-Watt.\n\nI now have more information on them and it’s fascinating. It takes us out East again to Hong Kong, then Kuala Lumpur, and various other locations.\n\n◊\n\nHOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES\n\nBut let’s start in Herefordshire, with this article from Country Life. It tells us:\n\nDavid, a successful hedge-fund manager based in Kuala Lumpur, his wife, Jenny . . . were living at the time in Malaysia and looking to buy a house in England.\n\nWhich they did, and they seemed so happy at Newport House. Their fourth daughter was born there.\n\nYet in 2018 David and Jenny Crichton-Watt moved to Switzerland and put the property on the market for £10m.\n\nThe money from selling Newport House could have covered the £1m splashed out on Troed-yr-Harn. But I suspect that’s a drop in the ocean to a family like Crichton-Watt.\n\nThe main vehicle for Crichton-Watt’s business activities might be Asian Investment Management Services (AIMS) which he set up in 1982. But he seems to have fingers in a number of pies.\n\nAmong them, Steppe Cement Ltd of Kazakhstan. This piece from the Financial Times in October 2022 tells us that the family had just increased its holding in the company.\n\nYou’ve probably seen their trucks delivering to builders in your area. Or maybe not.\n\nAnd as I say, Crichton-Watt has been involved in Hong Kong and China for a long time. Which is where we find Andrew James Kadoorie McAulay of Rewilding Wealth Ltd and who, as we read in the piece earlier this week, is also investing in Coleg Soros.\n\nAnother pie in which Crichton-Watt has a finger in is Phoenix Gold Fund Ltd.\n\nDavid Crichton-Watt is a busy man, on the global stage, and yet . . . I couldn’t find a photo of him. Even this piece (scroll down) has pictures of most investors interviewed, but not him.\n\n◊\n\nMONEY, MONEY, MONEY\n\nIn the previous piece, when I looked at Kadoorie-McAulay and his company, Rewilding Wealth Ltd, I wrote.\n\nLike me when I first saw it, you’re wondering about Rewilding Wealth Ltd. So here’s what I found. It’s registered with Companies House as an Overseas Entity. Located in that bastion of probity and openness, the British Virgin Islands.\n\nI re-visit this because BVI probably could be termed a ‘bastion of probity and openness’ when compared to Kazakhstan.\n\nFor while Kazakhstan is, theoretically, independent of Russia, links are strong, not least because Kazakh President Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, is kept in power by Putin.\n\nOn top of which, 15% of the population is ethnic Russian, and concentrated in the north, close to the Russian border. If he so wished, I’m sure Vlad could engineer a Sudetenland situation.\n\nKazakhstan acts as a Russian gateway and conduit to the rest of the world, and is something close to being a Russian satellite.\n\n◊\n\nALL PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE\n\nThe so-called ‘Welsh Government’ has sold us and our country down the river to the Globalist climate scammers, and those who’ve been encouraged to use the scam to enrich themselves.\n\nPart of the acceptance, a show of commitment by politicians and others, sees Wales playing a disproportionate role in the farce. In practice, it means waging war on motorists, farmers, and just about anybody else the fanatics claim is part of the threat.\n\nBlind acceptance that results in Welsh politicians pimping Wales out to renewable energy companies. And obeying the diktats of the green-haired and the swivel-eyed in various pressure groups.\n\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough . . . I’m told there are 873 environmental gangs operating in Wales, and there’ll be more by the time you read this. All demanding public funding . . . and privately-owned land.\n\nAlso corporations, hedge funds, and other investors seeking to buy farms in order to plant trees and make huge profits from ‘carbon sequestration’. A scam within a scam. Or even, as now seems to be the case with Coleg Soros, for rewilding.\n\n◊\n\nJUDGED BY THE COMPANY WE KEEP\n\nLet me make it clear that just because someone does business in exotic locales, where the application of rules may be ‘lax’, does not imply wrongdoing.\n\nThat said, I did turn up something that might cause concern, when I ran across this document, from which I’ve extracted the entry below. It links David Crichton-Watt, or his Asian Investment Management Services Ltd, with Lutea Trustees.\n\nThe document is produced by:\n\n‘The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a private American corporation that acts as a self-regulatory organization that regulates member brokerage firms and exchange markets‘, based in Washington, DC.\n\nNaturally, I got to wondering about Lutea. So I did another search. And turned up this document from the Jersey Financial Services Commission from 2022.\n\nThis is quite serious. ‘ML’ is money laundering, and ‘TF’ is terrorist financing.\n\nThe finger is firmly pointed at Andrew Mark Hicks. Who the Jersey Financial Services Commission has now barred from working in finance.\n\nFor at the end of the day, and as the Lutea website reminds us – ‘It’s all about trust‘.\n\nI’m not for one minute suggesting that David Crichton-Watt and his wife are involved in money laundering or terrorist financing, but a connection with an outfit like Lutea doesn’t help anybody’s reputation.\n\n◊\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nSo, does Coleg Soros, or ‘Welsh Government’, Powys county council, or any other bugger, care where the money arriving in Talgarth originates? Or how it’s made?\n\nIf not, then it’s up to the rest of us, who do care, to keep asking questions.\n\n♦ end ♦\n\n© Royston Jones 2024\n\nThis wasn’t planned, but it’s too big and complicated for a tweet, and so I’m putting it out as a quickie. As the title suggests, it concerns Coleg Soros in Talgarth, otherwise known as Black Mountains College.\n\nFor those new to this blog, or regulars with short memories, I have written a few times about Coleg Soros, so just type the name in the search box to the right. This piece from June 2019 will explain why I’ve renamed Black Mountains College after that evil old bastard (scroll down).\n\n◊\n\nCOLEG SOROS GROWS!\n\nOver the years I’ve become aware of two Coleg Soros entities: the now dissolved Black Mountains College Ltd, and Black Mountains College Project Ltd.\n\nBut there was a third company I’d somehow overlooked. In my defence I’ll say that this other company wasn’t launched until just before Christmas 2022. It’s Black Mountains College Operations Ltd. Scroll down on the overview page and you’ll see that it’s devoted to education.\n\nIt began life with a single £1 share held by director Ben Rawlence, who’s been involved with Coleg Soros from the off. But then things moved on apace.\n\n◊\n\nINTEREST FROM AFAR\n\nIn June 2023 there was a share issue with a total value of £4,480,000. A couple of weeks later, William John Lana became a director. In November 2023 the company produced a breakdown of shareholders. Here it is.\n\nLike me when I first saw it, you’re wondering about Rewilding Wealth Ltd. So here’s what I found.
