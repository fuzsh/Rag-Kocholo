        "meta_description": "Few people realize that former United States President Gerald Ford was born in Omaha as Leslie King, Jr. Visitors will learn of his name change and other presidential facts. The Betty Ford Rose Garden flourishes where Ford's boyhood home once stood. Twice destroyed by fire, only a replica now exists. Special displays feature White House memorabilia. The site is open year-round, but is especially beautiful in the summer months. Admission is free.",
