        "text": "Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr., the nation’s only unelected president and vice president, was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 14, 1913, the year his parents, Leslie and Dorothy King, divorced. Following his mother’s marriage in 1916 to Gerald R. Ford Sr. in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the future president was renamed for his stepfather and became known to his friends as “Jerry.” Young Ford attended public schools in Grand Rapids, joined Boy Scout Troop 15 of the Trinity Methodist Church, and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout—the only president to do so.1 Ford was a standout high school athlete and football player and went on to play for the University of Michigan, where he earned individual accolades, won two national championships, and received offers to play professionally. After graduation, he attended Yale Law School and briefly practiced law before volunteering to serve in the United States Navy during World War II. He saw action in the Pacific Theater and rose to the rank of lieutenant commander before being honorably discharged in 1946.2\n\nLess than a year later, facing impeachment and possible removal from office, President Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and Ford rose to the presidency. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the Oath of Office in the East Room, where President Ford spoke briefly afterward: “I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. . . . My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works, our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. . . . God helping me, I will not let you down.\"3\n\nPresident Ford immediately set out to reduce inflation and American energy dependency, as well as mitigate a growing economic recession. However, his decision to pardon Nixon slowed the new administration’s momentum, as the president’s approval ratings plummeted. Called to testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Ford explained his decision by stating that the pardon was in the country’s best interest. He believed it would allow citizens and representatives the opportunity to move on from Watergate and to focus on more pressing domestic challenges and international issues. He took a similar position supporting conditional amnesty for those who evaded serving in the Vietnam War. Ultimately, Ford’s controversial pardon likely contributed to his defeat in the presidential election of 1976. Since then, however, some political observers have commended Ford for his decision of conscience.4\n\nDuring his time in office, President Ford strengthened American ties with Japan, France, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe; negotiated the Helsinki Accords on human rights; and continued improving relations with the Soviet Union and China. He announced that the United States would no longer support the government of South Africa on account of its apartheid policies, and he used shuttle diplomacy—working between two parties as an intermediary—to ease conflict in the Middle East. Ford was the first American president to visit Japan, and he and First Lady Betty Ford reciprocated by hosting Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako for a State Visit in 1975. That same year, President Ford ordered American personnel and South Vietnamese allies evacuated as North Vietnamese forces advanced on Saigon. It was a stunning end to the Vietnam War, which had engulfed American politics, society, and culture for more than a decade.\n\nIn 1976, Ford ran for president, hoping to be elected in his own right, but he narrowly lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Gracious in defeat, the Fords invited the Carters to the White House less than three weeks after the election. President Ford closely coordinated with the president-elect to ensure a smooth transition of power between administrations. In his Inaugural Address, President Carter’s first words were: “For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.”5 President Carter spoke frequently with Ford, asking for his counsel on a variety of matters. When a historic peace agreement was reached between Israel and Egypt at Camp David, President Carter called Ford from the helicopter while returning to the White House to personally share the news with him.6\n\nThe first lady selected a “handmade crafts” theme to inspire the public to incorporate thriftier items into their holiday decor amid rising inflation, an economic downturn, and the lingering effects of the 1973 energy crisis.13 Mrs. Ford decorated the tree with handmade patchwork quilted ornaments created by women from Appalachia, ornamental balls made by senior citizens, and handmade toys by craftsmen. To conserve electricity, the Fords also used lower-wattage Christmas lights in the White House and on the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse.14\n\nIn 1975 First Lady Betty Ford continued to feature handmade ornaments with the theme “An Old-Fashioned Christmas in America,” trimming the Blue Room tree with popcorn, gingerbread cookies prepared by White House chefs, pinecones, paper dolls, dried fruits and vegetables, and fabric. Staff and volunteers from Colonial Williamsburg also contributed ornaments and lent antique toys and other pieces from its collection.15 The tree was decorated with garlands of dried red peppers rather than cranberries to make the ornaments last longer. However, that year a new White House tradition began when volunteer Christine Heineman created the first cranberry tree for the Red Room, placing fresh cranberries against a moss-covered Styrofoam cone. This tradition has continued ever since.16\n\nThe 2023 Official White House Christmas Ornament\n\nThis year’s ornament is a festive wreath inspired by the handcrafted Christmas decorations the Fords selected during their time in the White House. The ornament features dolls, cherubs, doves, stars, flowers, gingerbread men, candles, and pentagon balls, along with red ribbons with the words “Christmas 2023” and “The White House.”\n\nOn the back of the ornament are five emblems related to the life and presidency of Gerald R. Ford. “Troop 15” signifies Ford’s success in earning the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest achievable rank in the Boy Scouts of America; his athleticism is represented by a football embellished with “48,” the number he wore when playing for the University of Michigan; a likeness of Liberty recalls the family’s famous golden retriever; a Bicentennial pin signifies President and Mrs. Ford’s contributions to celebrating the 200th anniversary of America’s founding; and an emblem for the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) highlights the first-in-class aircraft carrier commissioned to honor the thirty-eighth president as the flagship of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group. There is also a gold plaque featuring the view toward the North Portico of the White House."
