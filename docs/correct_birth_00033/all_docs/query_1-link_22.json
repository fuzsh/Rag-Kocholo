Today, the house he lived in as an infant is gone, but in its place is a breathtaking little oasis where you can relax, enjoy nature, and maybe even learn something new.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe birthsite memorial is located in the historic Hanscom Park neighborhood of Omaha. Even if you aren’t interested in presidential history, this is the perfect place to spend a nice day outdoors. Have you ever visited?
