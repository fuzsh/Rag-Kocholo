Ford Biography Gerald R. Ford (1913-2006) Early Years Gerald R. Ford, the 38th President of the United States, was born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., the son of Leslie Lynch King and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King, on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, NE. His parents separated 2 weeks after his birth, and his mother moved with him to Grand Rapids, MI, to live with her parents. On February 1, 1916, approximately 2 years after her divorce, Dorothy King married Gerald R. Ford, a Grand Rapids businessman. The Fords immediately began calling her son Jerry Ford, and in 1935 his name was officially changed to Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. The future President grew up in a close-knit family that included three younger brothers, Thomas, Richard, and James. Mr. Ford attended South High School in Grand Rapids, where he excelled scholastically and athletically. He was named to the honor society and both the ``All- City'' and ``All-State'' football teams. To earn spending money he worked for the family paint business and at a local restaurant. He was also active in Scouting, and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in November 1927--the only American President to do so. College Years From 1931 to 1935 Mr. Ford attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he majored in economics and political science, and graduated with a B.A. degree in June 1935. At a time of national economic hardship, he financed his education with part-time jobs, a small scholarship from his high school, and modest family assistance. Outstanding Athlete An extremely gifted athlete, Mr. Ford was a 3-year letterman and played on Michigan's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933. He was voted the Wolverine's most valuable player in 1934. On January 1, 1935, he played in the annual East-West College All-Star Game in San Francisco. That August, he played at Soldier Field against the Chicago Bears in the Chicago Tribune College All-Star Football Game, and his performance led to offers from the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers. In tribute to one of its greatest student-athletes, Michigan subsequently retired Mr. Ford's jersey number 48. In addition, he was named to Sports Illustrated's Silver Anniversary All-America Football Team, received the National Football Foundation's Gold Medal--its highest honor--and in 2006 was recognized by the NCAA as one of the 100 most influential student-athletes of the last century. In 2003, the NCAA created the NCAA President Gerald R. Ford Award, which is presented annually to an individual who has provided significant leadership as an advocate for intercollegiate athletics on a continuous basis over the course of their career. In 2005, the ``Gerald R. Ford Legends of Center Award'' was created to honor and promote President Ford's athletic and public service ideals. The award is presented annually to an outstanding former collegiate or professional football center, who has also made significant contributions to his community through philanthropic or business endeavors. Yale Law School Mr. Ford chose the legal profession over a professional football career. To help pay for law school, he initially took a dual position as assistant varsity football coach and boxing coach at Yale University, where he coached future U.S. Senators Robert Taft, Jr. and William Proxmire. He enrolled in Yale Law School, while also continuing his coaching responsibilities. Among an extraordinary group of law school classmates were future Supreme Court Justices Potter Stewart and Byron White, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, Sargent Shriver, Pennsylvania Governors William Scranton and Raymond Shafer, U.S. Senator Peter Dominick, and author William Lord. Gerald Ford earned his LL.B. degree from Yale in 1941, and graduated in the top 25 percent of his class. After returning to Michigan and passing the bar exam, Mr. Ford and a University of Michigan fraternity brother, Philip A. Buchen (later to serve as President Ford's White House Counsel), established a law partnership in Grand Rapids. Mr. Ford also became active in a local group of reform-minded Republicans who called themselves the Home Front, when the United States entered World War II. Mr. Ford promptly joined the U.S. Naval Reserve, where he received a commission as an ensign in April 1942 and subsequently was appointed lieutenant commander. Following an orientation program at Annapolis, he became an instructor at a pre-flight school in Chapel Hill, NC. In spring 1943, he began service on the light aircraft carrier U.S.S. Monterey. Initially assigned as a gunnery division officer, then assistant navigator, he took part in major operations in the South Pacific, including the battles for Truk, Saipan, Guam, Formosa, Marianas, and the Philippines. During a vicious typhoon in the Philippine Sea in December 1944, he came within inches of being swept overboard. Severely damaged by the storm and a resulting fire, the ship had to be taken out of service. Lieutenant Commander Ford was honorably released from active duty in February 1946, having been awarded: An Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one silver star and four bronze stars, A Philippine Liberation Ribbon with two bronze stars, An American Campaign Medal, and A World War II Victory Medal. Congress Returning home to Grand Rapids, Mr. Ford became a partner in the prestigious law firm of Butterfield, Keeney and Amberg. A self- proclaimed ``compulsive joiner,'' he was already well known throughout the community. He rejected his previous support for isolationism and adopted, instead, an outlook more in keeping with America's new-found responsibilities on the global stage. In 1948, with the encouragement of his hometown political hero, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, and reinforced by his stepfather, who was county Republican chairman, Mr. Ford decided to challenge isolationist Congressman Bartel Jonkman in the Republican primary. Against all odds, the upstart Gerald Ford defeated Jonkman. In the subsequent general election that fall, he received 61 percent of the vote. At the age of 35, Gerald Ford was on his way to Washington for the 1st of 13 terms in the House of Representatives. A seat in Congress wasn't the only thing he won in autumn 1948. On October 15, at the height of the fall campaign, Mr. Ford married Elizabeth Ann Bloomer Warren. For over 58 years their partnership flourished, enriched immeasurably by their four children, Michael, John (Jack), Steven, and Susan, their seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Gerald Ford served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949 to December 6, 1973, being reelected 12 times, each time with more than 60 percent of the vote. The new Congressman quickly established a reputation for personal integrity, hard work, and the ability to deal effectively with both Republicans and Democrats--qualities that would define his entire political career. He once described himself as ``a moderate in domestic affairs, an internationalist in foreign affairs, and a conservative in fiscal policy.'' He became a member of the House Appropriations Committee in 1951 and rose to prominence on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, becoming its ranking minority member in 1961. In 1949, President Truman invited him to the White House for a personal tour to examine the dilapidated and dangerous conditions of the White House. Mr. Ford subsequently was instrumental in securing necessary congressional funding to rebuild and modernize the White House during the Truman Presidency. As his reputation as a legislator grew, Gerald Ford was called upon, among other assignments, to serve on the first NASA Oversight Committee and on the CIA and Intelligence Oversight Committees. He declined offers in the 1950s to run for both the Senate and the Michigan Governorship. His political ambition was specific--to become Speaker of the House. In 1960 he was mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential running mate for Richard Nixon. In 1963 a group of younger, more progressive House Republicans--the ``Young Turks''--rebelled against their party's leadership, and Mr. Ford defeated Charles Hoeven of Iowa for chairman of the House Republican Conference, the number three leadership position in the party. In 1963 following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, President Johnson appointed Gerald Ford to the Warren Commission that investigated the crime. Mr. Ford was the last living member of the Warren Commission. In 1965 he co-authored with John R. Stiles ``Portrait of the Assassin,'' a book about the findings of the Warren Commission. The battle for the 1964 Republican Presidential nomination was drawn on sharp ideological lines between liberal Nelson Rockefeller and conservative Barry Goldwater. However, Mr. Ford had previously endorsed Michigan's favorite son, Governor George Romney, and thus did not become embroiled in the resulting schism in the party. In the wake of Goldwater's lopsided defeat at the hands of Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford was chosen by the Young Turks to challenge Charles Halleck for the position of minority leader of the House. With the help of then- Congressmen Donald Rumsfeld and Bob Dole, Mr. Ford narrowly upset Halleck. He assumed his new position early in 1965 and held it for 8 years. As minority leader, his national stature rose quickly. As part of his efforts to rebuild the Republican Party, he typically made over 200 speeches a year across the country. Under Mr. Ford's leadership, the House Republicans steadily gained members, but never a majority. In both the 1968 and 1972 elections, Mr. Ford was a supporter of Richard Nixon, who had been a friend for many years. In 1968, Gerald Ford was again mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate. Not even the Nixon landslide of 1972 could give Republicans a majority in the House, thereby leaving Mr. Ford unable to reach his ultimate political goal--to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Vice President When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in October 1973, President Nixon was authorized by the 25th Amendment to appoint, subject to congressional confirmation, a replacement. He needed someone who could work with Congress, survive close scrutiny of his political career and private life, and be confirmed quickly. Heeding an immediate and strong bipartisan consensus, he chose Gerald R. Ford. Following one of the most thorough background investigations in the history of the FBI, Mr. Ford was confirmed by a vote of 92 to 3 in the Senate and 387 to 35 in the House of Representatives and sworn in as Vice President on December 6, 1973. President The specter of the Watergate scandal, the break-in at Democratic headquarters during the 1972 campaign, and the ensuing coverup by Nixon administration officials hung over Mr. Ford's 9-month tenure as Vice President. When it became apparent that evidence, public opinion, and the mood in Congress were all pointing toward impeachment, Richard Nixon became the only President to resign. On August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency amidst the gravest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. Few Presidents confronted so daunting a challenge. Not only did the new President face widespread public disillusionment in the wake of the Watergate scandals and the Vietnam war, he had to grapple with a devastating economic recession, a burgeoning energy crisis, and mounting tensions around the globe. The President who never sought the Presidency resolved that his time in office, however long or short, would be a time of healing and energizing the country to move forward in a positive way. But it was President Ford's confidence in his fellow citizens, and his devotion to our constitutional heritage, that helped him shoulder so effectively the burdens of the Oval Office. He immediately set about restoring confidence in the Presidency and healing the wounds of the Nation. In his first speech as President-- Lincolnesque in tone and Ford-like in its personal modesty--he said: ``My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy. As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate. With all the strength and all of the good sense I have gained from life, with all the confidence of my family, my friends, and my dedicated staff impart to me, and with the good will of countless Americans I have encountered in recent visits to 40 States, I now solemnly reaffirm my promise I made to you last December 6: to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me to see the right, and to do the very best I can for America. God helping me, I will not let you down.'' Pardon and Amnesty Shortly after becoming President, he announced amnesty terms for Vietnam-era draft evaders and pardoned his predecessor. Both acts were highly controversial at the time, but President Ford courageously put America's best interests ahead of his own political popularity. The pardon of Richard Nixon was an act as personally courageous as it was politically detrimental. However, Mr. Ford strongly believed that protracted criminal proceedings would keep the country mired in Watergate and prevent the new administration and the American people from addressing other critical issues. Accordingly, he decided to grant the pardon prior to the filing of any formal criminal charges against the former President. Many in Washington and around the country were in an uproar, and Gerald Ford's political honeymoon was over; his approval rating plummeted immediately with an estimated 60 percent of the American public disagreeing with the pardon. However, history has been much more generous regarding the pardon than were President Ford's contemporaries. This historical re- examination of the pardon culminated in the May 2001 presentation of the Profile in Courage Award to President Ford by the John F. Kennedy Foundation. As Senator Edward Kennedy explained in presenting the Award: ``At a time of national turmoil, America was fortunate that it was Gerald Ford who took the helm of the storm-tossed ship of state. Unlike many of us at the time, President Ford recognized that the Nation had to move forward, and could not do so if there was a continuing effort to prosecute former President Nixon. So President Ford made a courageous decision--one that historians now say cost him his office--and he pardoned Richard Nixon. I was one of those who spoke out against his action then. But time has a way of clarifying past events, and now we see that President Ford was right. His courage and dedication to our country made it possible for us to begin the process of healing and put the tragedy of Watergate behind us.'' President Ford's Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, was equally direct in concluding that Gerald Ford ``saved the country. In fact, he saved it in such a matter of fact way that he isn't given credit for it.'' New Administration Within the month President Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller for Vice President. On December 19, 1974, Rockefeller was confirmed by Congress, and the country once more had a full complement of leaders. Mr. Ford confronted a divisive war in Southeast Asia, rising inflation at home, and a desperate need to restore the credibility of the Presidency. He also found himself dealing with a Congress increasingly assertive of its rights and powers. The Ford philosophy was best summarized by one of his favorite speech lines: ``A government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.'' In domestic policy, President Ford pioneered economic deregulation, formulated tax and spending cuts, and decontrolled energy prices to stimulate production. Through such steps, he successfully contained both inflation and unemployment, while at the same time reducing the size and role of a Federal Government whose growth to many observers seemed inexorable. Thus, President Ford foreshadowed subsequent efforts by his successors to continue these policies to make government smaller, smarter and more supportive of private initiatives. He championed policies and legislation that brought about changes that today we take for granted, including individual retirement accounts (IRAs), automated teller machines (ATMs), Title IX regulations for women's high school and college athletics, and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. The heavily Democratic Congress often disagreed with President Ford, which led to numerous confrontations and his frequent use of the veto to restrain runaway government spending. Presidential historian Richard Norton Smith described the essence of Gerald Ford's leadership and strength of character: ``President Ford never confused compromise with surrender, or moderation with weakness. While he had adversaries, he never had an enemy.'' Documentary producer Michael Grass summarized Mr. Ford's effectiveness: ``Ford practiced the political art of intelligent compromise with low-key Midwestern habits of fairness, civility, and truth-telling.'' Columnist Mort Kondracke noted, ``Gerald Ford represented the best in American politics . . . and [a style] that I'm afraid we are never going to see again.'' Through tough negotiations and principled compromise and despite large Democratic majorities in Congress, landmark legislation was enacted to promote energy decontrol, implement sweeping tax cuts, deregulate the railroad and securities industries, and reform antitrust laws. Outstanding Cabinet and White House Staff One of Mr. Ford's greatest strengths as a leader was his self- confidence and sense of security around others. According to columnist David Broder, President Ford ``had one of the most competent staffs any of us have seen.'' The advisors he appointed included a large number of extremely bright, capable people who would go on after the Ford administration to render further outstanding service to the American people. George H.W. Bush was his CIA Director; his White House chief of staff was Dick Cheney; his Secretary of State was Henry Kissinger; his chief economic advisor was Alan Greenspan; Donald Rumsfeld was his Secretary of Defense; his Attorney General was Edward Levi; his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development was Carla Hills; Brent Scowcroft was his National Security Advisor, William Simon was Treasury Secretary, and David Mathews was Secretary of HEW; his Under Secretary of Commerce was James Baker; his Secretary of Transportation was William Coleman; Frank Zarb was Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration; his OMB Director and Deputy Director were James Lynn and Paul O'Neill; and his White House staff included Robert Gates, James Cannon, John Marsh, William Seidman, Max Friedersdorf, Terrence O'Donnell, Robert Hartmann, Red Cavaney, David Gergen, Larry Speakes, and Roger Porter. The list of President Ford's outstanding advisors who continued with distinguished public service careers goes on and on. Foreign Policy In foreign policy, Mr. Ford was resolute and visionary. He continued the policy of detente with the Soviet Union and developed an aggressive ``shuttle diplomacy'' in the Middle East. U.S.-Soviet relations were marked by ongoing arms negotiations, the Helsinki agreements on human rights principles and East European national boundaries, trade negotiations, and the symbolic Apollo-Soyuz joint manned space flight. One of President Ford's boldest, and at the time most controversial, foreign policy initiatives occurred in southern Africa. For many years, U.S. policy was to support the Government of South Africa, which for decades had practiced apartheid. In 1976, President Ford decided that a change in U.S. policy was long overdue, despite political considerations that strongly suggested otherwise. Secretary of State Kissinger went to Zambia and announced President Ford's decision that the longstanding U.S. support of South Africa, with its unconscionable policies of apartheid, was over. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, William Scranton, characterized this decision by President Ford as ``one of the finest achievements'' of twentieth century U.S. foreign policy. President Ford forcefully pushed for conclusion of the Helsinki agreements. His tireless efforts in negotiating those agreements, though politically controversial at the time, are now seen with the benefit of history as the first step toward democratization of Eastern Europe and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. Years later Colin Powell declared Gerald Ford's leadership and personal participation in the Helsinki agreements as ``a bold, brave, visionary act'' and ``one of President Ford's greatest moments.'' President Ford's personal diplomacy also included trips to Japan-- the first by an American President--and China; a 10-day European tour; and establishment of the annual international economic meeting of leaders (today known as the G-8 summits). In addition, as America's Bicentennial President, Gerald Ford received numerous foreign heads of state in the Nation's Capital. Henry Kissinger noted the depth and breadth of President Ford's achievements in foreign policy: ``President Ford established what I believe was the closest relationship of any American President, in any period, with European leaders, and he did this by his special qualities--openness, intelligence, directness. And what is even more remarkable is that they have remained friends of his even after he left government. . . . Abroad his reputation was enormous.'' With the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 as background, Congress and President Ford repeatedly clashed over Presidential powers, oversight of the CIA and covert operations, military aid appropriations, and the stationing of military personnel. On May 14, 1975, just days after Saigon fell, President Ford ordered U.S. forces to retake the SS Mayaguez, an American merchant ship seized by Cambodian gunboats in international waters 2 days earlier. The vessel was recovered, and all 39 crewmen were saved. Unfortunately, 41 brave Americans lost their lives in the preparation and execution of the rescue. The President himself did not escape the tumult of those times. On two separate trips to California in September 1975, Gerald Ford was the target of assassination attempts. The next year he fought off a strong challenge from Ronald Reagan to secure the Republican nomination for President, and a chance to have his leadership confirmed by the voters. He chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate. The Ford-Dole team succeeded in narrowing Democrat Jimmy Carter's large lead in the polls, only to fall short in one of the closest Presidential elections in U.S. history. The Presidency of Gerald Ford The Presidency of Gerald Ford is defined by his personal integrity and unbending adherence to the truth. Ever the Eagle Scout--literally and metaphorically--in reflecting on his life, President Ford consistently referred to the straightforward standards of conduct taught by his parents: ``Work hard, tell the truth, and come to dinner on time.'' Openness was, and is, a core Ford family value. Equally honest and open was Betty Ford, who as First Lady developed a reputation for candor and lack of pretense. President Ford strongly supported his wife in her battles with breast cancer, alcoholism, and addiction to prescription medicines, and he warmly endorsed her frank talk about these and other issues. In 2003 Vice President Dick Cheney observed, ``President Ford restored trust and confidence in the Presidency and the White House simply by the sheer force of his character.'' Thus, by the time of the Nation's Bicentennial, the American people had a renewed pride in their free institutions, and in themselves. Presidential biographer Richard Reeves acknowledged that his earlier assessment of the 38th President had been unduly harsh. A quarter century later, Reeves took a very different tack: ``We judge presidents by the one or two big things that they do,'' he wrote. ``Nobody remembers that Lincoln balanced the budget, and nobody cares. In the end, President Ford did the one thing he had to do, which was hold the country together.'' With the passage of time and the perspective of a broader historical context, the Presidency of Gerald Ford has been understood and acknowledged with much greater clarity and appreciation. Columnist David Broder was unequivocal: ``In an odd, inexplicable way, the truth has begun to dawn on people--that he was the kind of President Americans wanted--and didn't know they had.'' Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill concluded: ``God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford--the right man at the right time who was able to put the Nation back together.'' Former Senator Tom Daschle observed: ``As our President, Gerald Ford did more than wake us from our long national nightmare; he made it possible for us to dream again.'' As President Jimmy Carter graciously acknowledged on January 20, 1977, the man from Grand Rapids had indeed healed the land. Private Citizen Upon returning to private life, President and Mrs. Ford moved to California where they built a home in Rancho Mirage. President Ford's memoir, ``A Time to Heal'' was published in 1979. President Ford remained an active participant in the political process. He spoke out on important political issues and wrote numerous op-ed columns and other articles dealing with issues ranging from support for stem cell research and affirmative action, to urging a censure alternative to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. In 1999, 25 years after he assumed the Presidency, he returned to the East Room of the White House to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He and Mrs. Ford were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the first ever joint presentation of Congress' highest civilian honor. In November 2006, President Ford became the longest living President in U.S. history. The year 1981 saw the dedication of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, MI. Both institutions quickly established themselves as an important part of the Ford legacy. In 2006 the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy moved into its new home at the University of Michigan. President Ford was a frequent participant in conferences examining Congress, the Presidency, and foreign policy; Soviet-American relations; German reunification, the Atlantic Alliance, the future of American foreign policy; national security requirements for the 1990s; humor and the Presidency; and the role of First Ladies in the life of the Nation. At hundreds of colleges and universities he lectured on Congressional/ White House relations, Federal budget policies, and domestic and foreign policy issues. He attended the annual Public Policy Week Conferences of the American Enterprise Institute, and in 1982 established the AEI World Forum, which he hosted for many years in Vail, CO. This continues as an international gathering of former and current world leaders, as well as business executives--all gathered to discuss issues of topical concern. On August 9, 2004, President Ford spoke in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol to members of his Cabinet and White House staff and reflected on his life and Presidency: ``At my stage in life, one is inclined to think less about dates on a calendar than those things that are timeless--about leadership and service and patriotism and sacrifice, about doing one's best in meeting every challenge that life presents. ``History will judge our success. But no one can doubt our dedication. We set out to bind America's wounds, and to heal America's heart. By the time we celebrated our Bicentennial in 1976, we celebrated more than a distant event--we were able to take heart ourselves from the renewal of the great truths expressed by our Founders. ``Without seeking them, I was called upon to fill this Nation's highest offices. For 2\\1/2\\ years, I had the greatest privilege that can come to any American--to lead my countrymen through trying times, and uphold the sacred honor of free men and women everywhere. ``So I ask you to join me in saluting the past, savoring the present, and anticipating the future. For in America, the best has never been--it is always yet to be.'' And now Gerald R. Ford has passed on, having fulfilled the legacy instilled more than 90 years ago in a Grand Rapids household: ``love of God, love of family, love of country.'' Courtesy Gerald R.

Mrs. Ford, escorted by General Swan and Susan Ford Bales, proceeds to the motorcade. Motorcade departs Andrews Air Force Base en route to the World War II Memorial. En route, the motorcade passed slowly through Alexandria, Virginia, where thousands of people lined the motorcade route to pay their respects to President Ford. Motorcade arrives at World War II Memorial. Present at the World War II Memorial are female graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy who have gathered in tribute to President Ford's signing the legislation that admitted women to the Academy. Current Eagle Scouts and Boy Scouts from the Washington, DC, area are present. Several thousand members of the public, assisted by Mr. John Shlaes, are also present. World War II veterans groups come to attention, and Colors are posted. Naval boatswain's mate walks several steps forward toward the hearse. He then pauses and ``Pipes the Side,'' the Navy tradition of honoring senior officers onto or off of the ship. Upon conclusion, the boatswain's mate salutes and holds. The hearse moves slowly away from the Memorial. Mrs. Ford's limousine proceeds to the point just vacated by the hearse. Mrs. Ford acknowledges the female graduates/naval officers of the U.S. Naval Academy. Motorcade departs the World War II Memorial en route to the U.S. Capitol. President Ford previously chose not to have a funeral procession through downtown Washington. However, in tribute to President Ford, military units that would otherwise have marched in such a processional assemble in formation outside the U.S. Capitol in the plaza area just to the east of the House of Representatives steps. Motorcade arrives at U.S. Capitol, East Front of U.S. House of Representatives. President Ford is the President who served the longest in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, he is the only President who went directly from the U.S. House of Representatives, to the Vice Presidency, and then to the Presidency. Accordingly, in an unprecedented tribute, instead of the traditional processional into the Rotunda, President Ford's casket will be carried up the east steps of the U.S. House of Representatives and placed in repose on a bier immediately outside the main door of the House Chamber before being carried into the Rotunda for the State Funeral Service. Mrs. Ford, escorted by General Swan, proceeds inside the Capitol and then to the east corridor adjacent to the House Chamber. She is greeted by Mr. William Livingood, Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. House of Representatives and Mr. William Pickle, Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate. Michael Ford, John Ford, Steven Ford, Susan Ford Bales, Sarah Ford Goodfellow, Bekah Ford Cooke, Hannah Ford, Tyne Vance Berlanga, Heather Vance, Christian Gerald Ford and Jonathan Ford are escorted by Mr. Michael Wagner and Captain Eldridge Browne to the foot of the House steps. A group of President Ford's former House colleagues assembles at the top of the House steps. The following Ford family members and guests proceed to the balcony to the left of the House steps for the arrival ceremony: Gayle Ford, Vaden Bales, Juliann Ford, Blake Goodfellow, Clay Cooke, Matthew Bales, Gregory Willard, Ann Willard, Penny Circle, Ann Cullen, Janice Hart, Len Nurmi, Leon Parma, Barbara Parma, and Richard Garbarino. During the arrival ceremony and the subsequent State Funeral Service in the U.S. Capitol, Mrs. Ford and the family are assisted by Troy McNichols, Ted Daniel, Robert Goodwin, Rachel Perry, Lucy Tutwiler, and David Bohrer. Mrs. Ford, escorted by General Swan, proceeds outside to the top of the House steps, opposite the former congressional colleagues. Armed Forces Body Bearers remove the casket from the hearse. United States Army Band: ``Ruffles and Flourishes'' ``Hail to the Chief'' 21-Gun Salute ``America the Beautiful'' ``Holy Ghost with Light Divine'' Armed Forces Body Bearers carry the casket up the east steps to the House Entrance to the Capitol. The four Ford children, followed by the seven grandchildren, walk up the House steps immediately behind the casket. The honorary pallbearers then walk up the House steps immediately behind the grandchildren. At the top of the House steps, Mrs. Ford, escorted by General Swan and joined by the children and grandchildren, follows the casket into the Capitol. Mrs. Ford and the children and grandchildren proceed to the Rayburn Room, where they are received by House Speaker Dennis Hastert and President pro tempore of the Senate Ted Stevens. As Mrs. Ford enters the Rayburn Room, the Armed Forces Body Bearers move the casket to the Main Doors of the House Chamber. In an unprecedented tribute to President Ford, the casket is placed in repose directly outside the Main Doors of the House Chamber, which is open and lit. The casket remains there prior to the processional. Mrs. Ford, escorted by General Swan and accompanied by Speaker Hastert and President pro tempore Stevens and by her children and grandchildren, proceeds from the Rayburn Room and pauses briefly at the casket.

DANIEL P. COUGHLIN, Chaplain, U.S. House of Representatives: ``How mighty is the hand that can turn a page of history!'' Lord God, You call each of us by name and You alone know each of us through and through. You have called Gerald R. Ford unto Yourself and again he has responded to You with hope and is confirmed by America's prayers just as he sought them when called to serve as President of this great Nation. As we welcome Mrs. Ford and President Ford's family and friends to this Rotunda, the Nation is called to surround them with their prayers-- their sympathy for their loss and their gratitude for sharing his love and his loyalty with all of us for so many years in Government service. Again, at this moment of death, we humbly ask You, Lord, to grant peace and reconciliation, healing and gentle civility to this Nation, as this man so nobly tried to do in life's singular moments by his efforts to close chapter upon chapter on America's sadness. May the brightness of hope and the promise of eternal life reward this modest man, the Honorable Gerald Ford. And may the story of the 38th President of the United States inspire others in this Nation and around the world, to respond to Your Providential call as he did. Lord, call many to seize their moment to make a difference ``by serving the people's urgent needs.'' Then empower them to make bold steps in searching for ways of peace and reconciliation, just as he did. ``For mighty is the hand that can turn a page of history.'' THE HONORABLE TED STEVENS, President Pro Tempore, U.S. Senate: Mrs. Ford, Michael, Jack, Steven, and Susan, distinguished guests, members of the Ford family, friends of Gerald Ford in America and throughout the world: Tonight we say goodbye to a true gentleman, an exceptional leader, and our good friend, President Gerald Ford. In our Nation's history, only nine men have been called upon to assume the mantle of the Presidency by succession. Even among these chosen few, Gerald Ford stands out as exceptional for only one man has assumed both the Vice Presidency and the Presidency. When he took his oath as President, we were a people shaken by disbelief, racked with cynicism, and paralyzed by doubt. Then President Ford's voice--gentle but firm--told us, ``We must go forward now together.'' In our Nation's darkest hour, Gerald Ford lived his finest moment. Guided by his conscience, informed by our history, supported by the love and friendship of his wife, Betty, he was the man the hour required. He knew the road toward national healing began with courage to forgive. He reminded us: while the Presidency may be a human institution, there is great nobility in its humanity. While his path to office was unlikely, history will know Gerald Ford's Presidency was no accident. By the time he took the oath of office, he had achieved everything he set his mind to do: He earned the rank of Eagle Scout and became the University of Michigan football team's most valuable player. During World War II, he served our country with distinction and was one of the men who inspired the title ``the Greatest Generation.'' He honorably served the people of Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives. A ``Man of the House,'' Jerry Ford stepped proudly into his role as Vice President, and the Senate welcomed him as the President of our Chamber. While he never voted to break a tie in the Senate, he was known to all of us as a person full of friendship, willing to sit and discuss issues at the request of any Senator. President Ford achieved the goals he sought, but history will remember most, how, in its hour of need, our Nation sought him. As our 38th President, Gerald Ford stood ready to faithfully execute his office. In doing so, he woke us and told us ``Our long national nightmare is over.'' He was the steady hand in the storm, an honest broker of compromise. He became a great leader--an example for others to follow. President Ford understood the unique circumstances of his moment in history. He strove not to placate some, but to serve all. In so doing, he showed us there were still things which were good and honest and true. He restored our faith in our leaders, and he ensured the office of the Presidency was an institution worthy of the people it serves. We here honor a leader for America and the world. President Ford fought high inflation and unemployment, completed the process of bringing our troops home from Vietnam, set the framework for the Middle East peace accords, and began a new era of cooperation and friendship with Japan. He was deeply beloved by the people of Alaska for signing legislation to protect the marine resources within 200 miles of our shores. No one should suggest the tasks before him were easy. President Ford was scrutinized, questioned, and criticized. He was tested by the fire of public opinion. Few have remained hopeful in the face of such adversity, but Gerald Ford's optimism about America never wavered. He faced each challenge with bravery and courage matched only by his wife Betty, a woman who literally offered hope to millions of Americans by candidly sharing her experiences and inner strength. President Ford once said, ``I am indebted to no man, and only one woman--my dear wife.'' That debt our Nation shares, for Betty Ford is one of the most remarkable First Ladies to have ever graced the White House. In the days since President Ford's passing, many words have been spoken and many statements published alluding to the tremendous character with which he approached his nearly three decades in public life. It was a character I witnessed firsthand when, as chair of our Senate campaign committee, I worked closely with President Ford and his running mate, Senator Bob Dole. During that time, I developed a deeper understanding and greater appreciation for Jerry Ford as a man, a father, and a husband. As was his running mate, Bob Dole, he was deeply committed to our democracy. Absolute honesty, integrity, and openness were the hallmarks of his career. They are now the legacy and the challenge he leaves to us. President Ford's life is a reminder to those who serve this democracy--under this Capitol dome and elsewhere--that we are--for a time--the keepers of this great American experiment. Good stewardship requires us to see beyond party, beyond division, beyond personal aspirations. President Ford once said: ``The Constitution is the bedrock of all of our freedoms. Guard and cherish it, keep honor and order in your own house, and the Republic will endure.'' It will be a fitting tribute to our good friend's memory to make this truth our intention and our purpose. Upon taking the oath of office, President Ford asked our Nation to pray for him. In the next 2 days, Americans will come to this Rotunda to join us in praying for him once again. The line of visitors saying farewell has literally stretched from sea to shining sea--from California to our Nation's Capital. And it will end in Michigan, where the prayers of our grateful Nation will carry President Ford on his final journey home. THE HONORABLE J. DENNIS HASTERT, Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives: Mrs. Ford and members of the Ford family, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests: I don't think it is a coincidence that American history seems to be an almost providential narrative--a story about finding the right man at the right time to lead the Nation. The Presidency is more than agendas and ideas. It is, at its core, a human institution molded and shaped by the character of the men who have served there. In summer 1974, America didn't need a philosopher king or a warrior prince, an aloof aristocrat or a populist firebrand. We needed a healer. We needed a rock. We needed honesty and candor and courage. We needed Gerald Ford. President Ford was one of the few men in history who did not need great events to make him great. On the football field, in the halls of Congress, and in the Oval Office, there was always something big and solid about him. Big and solid and good. In this sacred place, the President now lies in state under the Statue of Freedom. On the way here we paused at the door to the House of Representatives. In that place--the People's House--where Gerald Ford served for a quarter of a century--he was known simply as the ``Gentleman from Michigan.'' And while all Members are afforded this courtesy, in the case of Gerald Ford--``gentleman''--was much more a description of the man himself. For in a time when turmoil and bitter division were all too common, he stood out as a man of deep civility, quiet thoughtfulness and sound judgment. Like Abraham Lincoln, another great Midwestern President who confronted a Nation divided, Gerald Ford was called upon to bind our country's wounds. The twin crises of Vietnam and Watergate had crippled America--sapped our strength--shaken our confidence. With humility and devotion to purpose, Gerald Ford united us once again. In an era of moral confusion, Gerald Ford confidently lived the virtues of honesty, decency, and steadfastness. His example of fairness and fair play, of dignity and grace, brought forth in us our better instincts. He reminded us who we should be and he helped us to heal. The traits that Gerald Ford showed us as a congressional leader--the ability to listen, the courage to forge compromise in the face of shrill partisanship, and the willingness to make the hard, and sometimes unpopular decisions, served him well as President. The critics of the day got it wrong, but history is getting it right. Despite his considerable achievements, the greatness of Gerald Ford lies not in what he did--but in who he was. He represented the strength of the Middle America that forged him. He never changed. Even when power was thrust upon him he remained an ``every man'' who exemplified all that is good about America. Mrs. Ford, you were his best friend, his close partner--and, along with his faith, the source of his strength. You and your children knew him as a devoted family man and you loved him for his integrity, his kindness, and his humor. As the leader of our country at a difficult time in our history, it was those qualities that drew a grateful Nation to him as well. We can never thank you enough for sharing him with us. Just a few feet from here--in the House Chamber--Gerald Ford was sworn in as Vice President of the United States. It would not be long before he would become our President. Speaking to the Nation after taking the oath as President he concluded by saying: ``I now solemnly reaffirm my promise to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right as God gives me to see the right and to do the very best for America. God helping me, I will not let you down.'' You did right, Mr. President. You did not let us down. Well done, good and faithful servant. Godspeed Mr. President. THE HONORABLE RICHARD B. CHENEY, Vice President of the United States: Mrs. Ford, Susan, Mike, Jack, and Steve; distinguished guests; colleagues and friends; and fellow citizens: Nothing was left unsaid, and at the end of his days, Gerald Ford knew how much he meant to us and to his country. He was given length of years, and many times in his company we paid our tributes and said our thanks. We were proud to call him our leader, grateful to know him as a man. We told him these things, and there is comfort in knowing that. Still, it is an ending. And what is left now is to say goodbye. He first stood under this dome at the age of 17, on a high school tour in the Hoover years. In his congressional career, he passed through this Rotunda so many times--never once imagining all the honors that life would bring. He was an unassuming man, our 38th President, and few have ever risen so high with so little guile or calculation. Even in the three decades since he left this city, he was not the sort to ponder his legacy, to brood over his place in history. And so in these days of remembrance, as Gerald R. Ford goes to his rest, it is for us to take the measure of the man. It's hard to imagine that this most loyal of men began life as an abandoned child, facing the world alone with his mother. He was devoted to her always, and also to the fine man who came into their lives and gave the little boy a name he would carry into history. Gerald and Dorothy Ford expected good things of their son. As it turned out, there would be great things, too--in a journey of 93 years that would fill them with loving pride. Jerry Ford was always a striver--never working an angle, just working. He was a believer in the saying that in life you make your own luck. That's how the Boy Scout became an Eagle Scout; and the football center, a college all-star; and the sailor in war, a lieutenant commander. That's how the student who waited tables and washed dishes earned a law degree, and how the young lawyer became a Member of the U.S. Congress, class of 1948. The achievements added up all his life, yet he was known to boast only about one. I heard it once or twice myself--he said he was never luckier than when he stepped out of Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids with a beautiful girl named Betty as his bride. Fifty-eight years ago, almost to the day, the new Member from Michigan's Fifth District moved into his office in the Cannon Building, and said his first hello to the Congressman next door, John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. They belonged to a generation that came early to great duties, and took up responsibilities readily, and shared a confidence in their country and its purposes in the world. In that 81st Congress were four future Presidents, and others who wished for that destiny. For his part, Mr. Ford of Michigan aspired only to be Speaker of the House, and by general agreement he would have made a fine one. Good judgment, fair dealing, and the manners of a gentleman go a long way around here, and these were the mark of Jerry Ford for a quarter century in the House. It was a Democrat, the late Martha Griffiths, who said, ``I never knew him to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part true and part false, and I never heard him utter an unkind word.'' Sometimes in our political affairs, kindness and candor are only more prized for their scarcity. And sometimes even the most careful designs of men cannot improve upon history's accident. This was the case in the 62d year of Gerald Ford's life, a bitter season in the life of our country. It was a time of false words and ill will. There was great malice, and great hurt, and a taste for more. And it all began to pass away on a Friday in August, when Gerald Ford laid his hand on the Bible and swore to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. He said, ``You have not elected me as your President by your ballot, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers.'' What followed was a Presidency lasting 895 days, and filled with testing and trial enough for a much longer stay. Even then, amid troubles not of his own making, President Ford proved as worthy of that office as any who had ever come before. He was modest and manful; there was confidence and courage in his bearing. In judgment, he was sober and serious, unafraid of decisions, calm and steady by nature, always the still point in the turning wheel. He assumed power without assuming airs; he knew how to treat people. He answered courtesy with courtesy; he answered discourtesy with courtesy. This President's hardest decision was also among his first. And in September 1974, Gerald Ford was almost alone in understanding that there can be no healing without pardon. The consensus holds that this decision cost him an election. That is very likely so. The criticism was fierce. But President Ford had larger concerns at heart. And it is far from the worst fate that a man should be remembered for his capacity to forgive. In politics it can take a generation or more for a matter to settle, for tempers to cool. The distance of time has clarified many things about President Gerald Ford. And now death has done its part to reveal this man and the President for what he was. He was not just a cheerful and pleasant man--although these virtues are rare enough at the commanding heights. He was not just a nice guy, the next-door neighbor whose luck landed him in the White House. It was this man, Gerald R. Ford, who led our republic safely through a crisis that could have turned to catastrophe. We will never know what further unravelings, what greater malevolence might have come in that time of furies turned loose and hearts turned cold. But we do know this: America was spared the worst. And this was the doing of an American President. For all the grief that never came, for all the wounds that were never inflicted, the people of the United States will forever stand in debt to the good man and faithful servant we mourn tonight. Thinking on all this, we are only more acutely aware of a time in our lives and of its end. And we can be certain that Gerald Ford would now ask only that we remember his wife. Betty, the President was not a hard man to read, and to his friends nothing was more obvious than the source of his great happiness. It was you. And all the good that you shared, Betty, all the good that you did together, has not gone away. All of that is forever. There is a time to every purpose under Heaven. In the years of Gerald Rudolph Ford, it was a time to heal. There is also, in life, a time to part, when those who are dear to us must go their way. And so for now, Mr. President--farewell. We will always be thankful for your good life. In Almighty God, we place our confidence. And to Him we confirm you, with our love and with our prayers. DR. BARRY C. BLACK, Chaplain, U.S. Senate: Eternal, Lord God, the giver of every good and perfect gift, this evening we express our gratitude to you for giving our Nation the blessing of President Gerald R. Ford. Lord, when this land desperately needed strong moral leadership, you gave it--President Ford's astuteness, honor, commitment, and courage. When we needed a model of unswerving integrity, you provided us with someone who was true and honest. Accept our gratitude for his courage to decide based upon principles, for his pragmatic leadership during cynical times, and for his long life of exemplary service. Thank you for his efforts to do what was in the country's best interests and for helping to bind the Nation's wounds after Watergate and Vietnam. Thank you also for permitting him to remind us that family and faith still matter, and that right living is a language which is clear to everyone. Comfort those who mourn, particularly Mrs. Ford and the children. May the memory of President Ford's dignity, decency, diligence, and decisiveness challenge us to use our lives for your glory. We pray in the name of him who is the resurrection and the life. Amen. At the conclusion of the service, Mrs. Ford, escorted by Vice President Cheney and accompanied by her four children, approaches the casket for a moment of prayer.

A Reading from the Letter of James. ... You must understand this, my beloved: let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger; for your anger does not produce God's righteousness. Therefore rid yourselves of all sordidness and rank growth of wickedness, and welcome with meekness the implanted word that has the power to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves. For if any are hearers of the word and not doers, they are like those who look at themselves in a mirror; for they look at themselves and, on going away, immediately forget what they were like. But those who look into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers who act--they will be blessed in their doing. ... Reader The Word of the Lord. ...

University of Michigan, B.A., 1935 Yale University School of Law, LL.B., 1941 United States Navy, 1942-1946 United States House of Representatives, 1949-1973 Vice President of the United States, 1973-1974 President of the United States, 1974-1977 THE HONORABLE GEORGE H.W. BUSH, Former President of the United States: Well, as the story goes, Gerald Ford was a newly minted candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in June 1948 when he made plans with a reporter to visit the dairy farmers in Western Michigan's Fifth Congressional District. It was pouring rain that particular day and neither the journalist nor the farmers had expected the upstart candidate to keep his appointment. And yet he showed up on time because, as he explained to the journalist, ``they milk cows every day and, besides that, I promised.'' Long before he arrived in Washington, Gerald Ford's word was good. During the three decades of public service that followed his arrival in our Nation's Capital, time and again he would step forward and keep his promise even when the dark clouds of political crisis gathered over America. After a deluded gunman assassinated President Kennedy, our Nation turned to Gerald Ford and a select handful of others to make sense of that madness. And the conspiracy theorists can say what they will, but the Warren Commission report will always have the final definitive say on this tragic matter. Why? Because Jerry Ford put his name on it and Jerry Ford's word was always good. A decade later, when scandal forced a Vice President from office, President Nixon turned to the minority leader in the House to stabilize his administration because of Jerry Ford's sterling reputation for integrity within the Congress. To political ally and adversary alike, Jerry Ford's word was always good. And, of course, when the lie that was Watergate was finally laid bare, once again we entrusted our future and our hopes to this good man. The very sight of Chief Justice Burger administering the oath of office to our 38th President instantly restored the honor of the Oval Office and helped America begin to turn the page on one of our saddest chapters. As Americans we generally eschew notions of the indispensable man, and yet during those traumatic times, few if any of our public leaders could have stepped into the breach and rekindled our national faith as did President Gerald R. Ford. History has a way of matching man and moment. And just as President Lincoln's stubborn devotion to our Constitution kept the Union together during the Civil War, and just as F.D.R.'s optimism was the perfect antidote to the despair of the Great Depression, so too can we say that Jerry Ford's decency was the ideal remedy for the deception of Watergate. For this and for so much more, his Presidency will be remembered as a time of healing in our land. In fact, when President Ford was choosing a title for his memoirs, he chose words from the book of Ecclesiastes. Here was the verse: ``To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. ``A time to be born, a time to die. ``A time to kill, and a time to heal. ``A time to weep, and a time to laugh. ``A time to mourn, and a time to dance.'' He acknowledged that he was no saint. To know Jerry was to know a Norman Rockwell painting come to life. An avuncular figure, quick to smile, frequently with his pipe in his mouth. He could be tough. He could be tough as nails when the situation warranted. But he also had a heart as big and as open as the Midwest plains on which he was born. And he imbued every life he touched with his understated gentility. When we served together in the House of Representatives years ago, I watched from the back bench--I watched this good man--and even from way back there I could see the sterling leadership qualities of Jerry Ford. And later, after I followed his footsteps into the Oval Office, he was always supportive. On the lighter side, Jerry and I shared a common love of golf and also a reputation for suspect play before large crowds. ``I know I'm playing better golf,'' President Ford once reported to friends, ``because I'm hitting fewer spectators.'' He had a wonderful sense of humor and even took it in stride when Chevy Chase had to make the entire world think that this terrific, beautifully coordinated athlete was actually a stumbler. Ford said it was funny. He wrote it in his memoir. I remember that lesson well, since being able to laugh at yourself is essential in public life. I'd tell you more about that, but as Dana Carvey would say: ``Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.'' In the end, we are all God's children. And on this bittersweet day we can take solace that the Lord has come and taken this good man by the hand and led him home to heaven. It is plain to see how the hand of providence spared Jerry in World War II and later against two assassination attempts. And for that we give thanks. It is just as plain to see how the same hand directed this good man to lead a life of noble purpose, a life filled with challenge and accomplishment, a life indelibly marked by honor and integrity. And today we give thanks for that, too. May Almighty God bless the memory of Gerald R. Ford and keep him firm in the hearts of his countrymen. And may God bless his wonderful family. THE HONORABLE HENRY A. KISSINGER, Former Secretary of State: According to an ancient tradition, God preserves humanity despite its many transgressions because at any one period there exist 10 just individuals who, without being aware of their role, redeem mankind. Gerald Ford was such a man. Propelled into the Presidency by a sequence of unpredictable events, he had an impact so profound it's rightly to be considered providential. Unassuming and without guile, Gerald Ford undertook to restore the confidence of Americans in their political institutions and purposes. Never having aspired to national office, he was not consumed by driving ambition. In his understated way, he did his duty as a leader, not as a performer playing to the gallery. Gerald Ford had the virtues of small-town America: sincerity, serenity and integrity. As it turned out, the absence of glibness and his artless decency became a political asset, fostering an unusual closeness to leaders around the world, which continued long after he left office. In recent days, the deserved commentary on Gerald Ford's character has sometimes obscured how sweeping and lasting were his achievements. Gerald Ford's prudence and common sense kept ethnic conflicts in Cyprus and Lebanon from spiraling into regional war. He presided over the final agony of Indochina with dignity and wisdom. In the Middle East, his persistence produced the first political agreement between Israel and Egypt. He helped shape the act of the Helsinki European Security Conference, which established an internationally recognized standard for human rights, now generally accepted as having hastened the collapse of the former Soviet empire. He sparked the initiative to bring majority rule to southern Africa, a policy that was a major factor in ending colonialism there. In his Presidency, the International Energy Agency was established, which still forces cooperation among oil-consuming nations. Gerald Ford was one of the founders of the continuing annual economic summit among the industrial democracies. Throughout his 29 months in office, he persisted in conducting negotiations with our principal adversary over the reduction and control of nuclear arms. Gerald Ford was always driven by his concern for humane values. He stumped me in his 5th day in office when he used the first call made by the Soviet Ambassador to intervene on behalf of a Lithuanian seaman who 4 years earlier had in a horrible bungle been turned over to Soviet authorities after seeking asylum in America.
