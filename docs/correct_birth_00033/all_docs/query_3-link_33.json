        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1913–2006). When Gerald Ford became the 38th president of the United States on August 9, 1974, the country had for the first time in its history an appointed chief executive. He took leadership of the country when his predecessor, Richard Nixon, became the first United States president to resign.\n\nIn Ford’s two and one-half years as president, his greatest challenge was to deal with the country’s severe recession. By late 1975 his cautious policies to limit spending and control inflation seemed to be bringing steady improvement to the economy. Unemployment remained high, however, and it was largely on this issue that Ford lost the 1976 election to the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter. The first incumbent since Herbert Hoover to be defeated for the presidency, Ford received 241 electoral votes from 27 states. Carter won almost 41 million popular votes, while Ford polled 39 million.\n\nFord was minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives when President Nixon designated him vice president on October 12, 1973. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew had resigned two days earlier, after pleading no contest on a felony charge of federal income tax evasion. Ford ascended to the vice presidency under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 1967. It authorizes the president to fill any vacancy in the office of vice president, subject to confirmation by a majority vote in both houses of Congress.\n\nThe scandals of the Nixon Administration made it clear that Ford might be elevated to the presidency. Congress subjected him to the closest scrutiny ever given a public official. An inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and open Congressional hearings resulted in Ford’s confirmation by a vote of 92 to 3 in the Senate and 387 to 35 in the House. He was sworn in on December 6, 1973.\n\nIn his 25 years as Republican congressman from Grand Rapids, Michigan, Ford was unmistakably partisan and conservative in his politics. His Democratic opposition respected him as a politician, however, and liked him as a trustworthy and unpretentious man.\n\nFord’s Early Years\n\nFord was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Leslie Lynch King, a wool trader, and Dorothy Gardner King. He was originally named Leslie Lynch King, Jr., for his father. When the child was less than two years old, his parents were divorced. His mother took him to Grand Rapids, where her parents were living. In 1916 Mrs. King married Gerald R. Ford, who adopted her child and gave him his name, Gerald Rudolph Ford. Three sons were born to the Fords—Thomas, Richard, and James. King also remarried, and a son and two daughters were born to this marriage. They were named Leslie Henry, Marjorie, and Patricia. King died in 1941, and Mrs. Ford died in 1967, five years after her husband died.\n\nOn his mother’s side, Ford traced his American ancestry to Ezra Chase, who was born in Massachusetts in 1717. The president’s grandfather on the King side was Charles Henry King, a prosperous wool merchant whose business interests were in Wyoming.\n\nGerald Ford, Sr., who had a reputation for integrity, hard work, and community involvement, instilled his values in young Gerald, who was known as Jerry. His mother taught him to be even-tempered. The depression years were not easy for the family. The stock market crash of 1929 almost wiped out Ford’s paint and varnish company. As a high-school student, Jerry Ford waited on tables and washed dishes at a restaurant to earn money.\n\nAt South High School, the young Ford won all-city and all-state honors in football. At the University of Michigan, he was a center on Michigan’s undefeated championship football teams of 1932 and 1933. He was voted the team’s most valuable player in 1934, and in 1935 he was selected as a College All-Star. When Ford graduated with a liberal arts degree in 1935, he refused offers from the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions to play professional football. He decided instead to coach football and boxing at Yale University. Ford coached at Yale from 1935 to 1940. In 1938 he began to take law courses, and he was in the top third of his class when he received his degree from Yale Law School in 1941.\n\nA natural athlete, Ford kept up his interest in sports and fitness. Past the age of 60 he still liked to swim daily; he also skied, golfed, and played tennis.\n\nFord was admitted to the bar in 1941 and practiced law for a short time before joining the United States Navy in April 1942. He served for 47 months, 18 of them as an aviation operations officer aboard the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey.\n\nWhen his naval service ended, Ford had the rank of lieutenant commander. He returned to Grand Rapids and his law practice, but he was interested in politics. His wartime experience made him think more about the role of the United States in the world.\n\nPolitical Beginnings and Married Life\n\nMichigan’s senior United States senator, Arthur Vandenberg of Grand Rapids, had forsaken his longtime isolationism to become an outstanding spokesman for internationalism. In 1948 he encouraged Ford to run against the isolationist Bartel Jonkman, of the Fifth Congressional District. Ford won the primary election by nearly a 2-to-1 margin. He went on to defeat his Democratic opponent with 74,191 votes against 46,972. In 12 subsequent elections, Ford carried his district with at least 60 percent of the vote.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Junior Chamber of Commerce gave Ford its Distinguished Service Award in 1948. In 1949 the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce cited him as one of 10 outstanding young Americans.\n\nThrough friends Ford met Elizabeth (Betty) Bloomer Warren, a fashion coordinator for a Grand Rapids department store. She was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 8, 1918, but she lived most of her life in Grand Rapids. She had modeled clothes for a living and had studied dance in New York City for a time with Martha Graham. A five-year marriage had ended in divorce. She and Ford were married on October 15, 1948. They had three sons and a daughter—Michael Gerald, born 1950; John Gardner, born 1952; Steven Meigs, born 1956; and Susan Elizabeth, born 1957.\n\nRecord in Congress\n\nAs a young congressman, Ford followed debates, learned strategy, and gave personal service to his constituents. Ford was a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal policy, and an internationalist in foreign affairs. He distrusted federal programs designed to overcome poverty and social inequality. His constituency did not like what he called the “heavy hand” of government in their lives. From 1951 to 1965 Ford was a member of the House Appropriations Committee, specializing in the defense budget and foreign aid. He endorsed large military budgets.\n\nIn 1963 Ford served as a member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford later was coauthor of a book titled Portrait of the Assassin (1966).\n\nThe young Republican congressmen wanted new leadership after the Democratic landslide election of 1964. They convinced Ford, then chairman of the House Republican Conference, to run for House minority leader against Charles A. Halleck of Indiana. Ford defeated Halleck in the Republican caucus and thus became a national figure. In a weekly televised press conference, Ford and Senate Minority Leader Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois took issue with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s domestic program and conduct of the war in Vietnam.\n\nAs minority leader, Ford was able to hold together the diverse elements of his party. He was unstinting with campaign and fund-raising efforts. He maintained a 90 percent attendance record in Congress, yet he found time to average nearly 200 out-of-town speeches a year on behalf of other congressmen. In the 1966 elections, he helped to bring about the Republican gain of 47 freshman seats in the House.\n\nWhen Nixon ran for the presidency in 1968, Ford served as permanent chairman of the Republican National Convention. In that post, he helped his old friend and congressional colleague to win the nomination. Ford was a staunch defender of the Vietnam conflict, but when President Nixon began to wind down involvement there and move toward détente with the Soviet Union, Ford supported those policies. In fact, he backed Nixon all the way on most controversial issues.\n\nThe 40th Vice President\n\nFord often said that his ambition was to become speaker of the House, but in 1973 it was unlikely that Republicans would soon be controlling the House. Ford was thinking about ending his political career in 1976 and returning, perhaps, to law practice, but then came the call to the vice presidency.\n\nGerald Ford was sworn in as 40th vice president of the United States in the chamber of the House that he loved so well. A joint session of Congress was convened for the occasion. During his eight months in that post, Ford flew more than 100,000 miles and made more than 500 appearances to rally his party. The Republicans were in large part agonized, along with other Americans, by the scandals known collectively as Watergate. Former Nixon aides and associates were being indicted, tried, and sentenced to prison terms. Nixon was resisting subpoenas for evidence, and the House of Representatives was weighing impeachment. Ford supported Nixon, but he also urged him to cooperate with the special Watergate prosecutor.\n\nThe Power Passes\n\nIn President Nixon’s resignation speech, he said that the leadership of the country would be in good hands with Ford. On the following day, as Nixon’s letter of resignation was delivered to the secretary of state, Ford became president. Shortly afterward, he took the oath of office administered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger of the United States Supreme Court. Members of the Nixon Cabinet and congressional leaders attended the ceremony in the East Room of the White House, where Nixon had said farewell to friends and staff that morning.\n\nIn a brief address, President Ford called on the country to bind up the wounds of Watergate. “Our long national nightmare is over,” he said. “Our Constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men.” He promised to follow his instincts of openness and candor. His voice broke as he said, “May our former president who brought peace to millions find it for himself.”\n\nA New Administration\n\nFord began to meet at once with envoys of foreign governments to reassure them that he would continue the foreign policy of the Nixon Administration. With President Ford was Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who retained his office at Ford’s request. Ford later asked all members of the Cabinet and all heads of government agencies to remain for the sake of continuity and stability.\n\nThe Cabinet, besides Secretary Kissinger, included William E. Simon, secretary of the treasury; James R. Schlesinger, secretary of defense; William B. Saxbe, attorney general; Rogers C.B. Morton, secretary of the interior; Earl L. Butz, secretary of agriculture; Frederick B. Dent, secretary of commerce; Peter J. Brennan, secretary of labor; Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of health, education, and welfare; James T. Lynn, secretary of housing and urban development; and Claude S. Brinegar, secretary of transportation.\n\nAn effort to reduce an executive staff that had swelled tremendously under a succession of predecessors was begun by Ford, who also sought to make the presidency more open and less imperial. During the Nixon years the tone and trappings of the presidency were widely criticized.\n\nFord asked Republican officials and Democratic congressional leaders to suggest their choices for vice president. On August 20 he announced his selection of former Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York as vice president designate. Under the 25th Amendment his nomination, too, was subject to congressional approval. When Rockefeller took the oath of office on December 19, 1974, for the first time in its history the country had both a president and a vice president not elected by the people.\n\nAt the beginning of his presidency Ford tried to turn the attention of the country from Watergate toward solutions of its many other problems. Two acts caused much dissension and hurt his chances for reelection. On September 8, 1974, Ford granted a pardon to Nixon for all crimes that he might have committed as president. Because the pardon precluded federal prosecution of Nixon, many people criticized it as violating the principle of equal justice under the law. Ford also gave Nixon custody of tapes and documents pertaining to Watergate, a move later reversed.\n\nMany groups also opposed Ford’s plan to give conditional amnesty to men who had evaded military service during the Vietnam War. His program required up to two years of public service. When the program ended in 1975, only about one-fifth of those eligible had applied. Fewer than one-half of those granted amnesty had accepted its terms.\n\nDomestic Affairs\n\nA combination of inflation and high unemployment plagued the country when Ford assumed the presidency. In September he held an economic summit with congressional leaders and representatives of labor, industry, and agriculture. Ford initially proposed a program to reduce inflation, which was running at a yearly rate of 12 percent. His WIN (Whip Inflation Now) program relied upon several voluntary measures to hold down prices and wages.\n\nBy the end of 1974, however, it became apparent that decreasing industrial production and business activity, accompanied by rapidly rising unemployment, were as serious as inflation. Ford’s WIN campaign was abandoned for alternate measures that would bring the country out of its most severe depression since World War II.\n\nThe president’s economic proposals were generally cautious. He agreed to tax cuts, and he released some funds for housing and other construction to stimulate the economy. Ford opposed large public works programs. He advocated holding down government spending, particularly for social programs. Ford worked to restore health to the private sector of the economy and through it to the nation as a whole.\n\nBy May 1975 unemployment had risen above 9 percent; it then began a slow decline as business improved. Inflation dropped below 8 percent for 1975 and continued to decline slowly. By mid-1976, however, unemployment still stood above 7 percent.\n\nFord’s economic program received a mixed reception—largely because of its failure to create more jobs. The overwhelmingly Democratic Congress strongly opposed his policies. During the first two years of his presidency Ford vetoed nearly 60 bills, several of which would have appropriated large sums to create jobs and stimulate the economy. In spite of its liberal strength, Congress was able to override only about one of every five of the vetoes.\n\nTax legislation, public works programs, and energy policy were issues that sharply divided Ford and Congress. He compromised early in 1975 by agreeing to larger tax cuts than he had wanted. Ford opposed their extension into 1976, however, unless they were accompanied by limits on government spending. He finally accepted a nonbinding agreement to try to curb spending. The tax cuts were further extended by the Tax Reform Act of 1976. In June 1975 Ford vetoed a $5.3-billion public jobs bill, claiming that such a program would be inflationary. Congress failed to override the veto. In August 1976, however, Congress passed a similar bill of nearly $4 billion and overrode Ford’s veto of the measure.\n\nFord advocated an energy policy that would discourage consumption by allowing prices to rise. He proposed the removal of price controls from domestic oil, a tariff on imported oil, and deregulation of natural gas prices. Congress favored continued price controls and mandatory measures, including rationing if necessary. Early in 1975 Ford initiated tariffs on imported oil, an act he later revoked. He vetoed legislation extending controls, then agreed to their temporary extension. In December 1975 Ford and Congress finally reached agreement on an energy policy, temporarily retaining controls that were to be lifted gradually over the next 40 months.\n\nOther legislation vetoed by Ford included bills on housing, education, day care, and labor. One of his most controversial vetoes was of a bill that would have allowed a striking union to picket all contractors at a construction site. Ford threatened to veto any financial aid to New York City, which was nearly bankrupt. In November 1975, however, he proposed direct federal loans if the city balanced its budget, and Congress agreed to his proposals.\n\nPartly because of the Watergate scandals, investigations of United States intelligence operations continued during the Ford Administration. In January 1975 Ford appointed Vice President Rockefeller to head a commission to study improper activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Congressional committees investigated both the CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Reports issued during the year, some of them over the objections of Ford, revealed that both the CIA and FBI had committed numerous illegal and unethical acts.\n\nThere were many changes in Ford’s Cabinet. To head the troubled Justice Department, which had been criticized for its handling of the Watergate investigation, Ford appointed Edward H. Levi, president of the University of Chicago, to succeed Saxbe as attorney general. Stanley K. Hathaway replaced Morton as secretary of the interior, but he soon resigned and was succeeded by Thomas S. Kleppe. Morton succeeded Dent as secretary of commerce but was later replaced by Elliot L. Richardson.\n\nJohn T. Dunlop succeeded Brennan as secretary of labor, but he resigned when Ford vetoed the common situs bill. Ford appointed W.J. Usery, Jr., to succeed Dunlop. Ford chose F. David Mathews, president of the University of Alabama, to replace Weinberger as secretary of health, education, and welfare. Carla A. Hills, only the third woman to have Cabinet rank, was appointed as secretary of housing and urban development, succeeding Lynn. William T. Coleman, Jr., the second African American to serve in a president’s Cabinet, replaced Brinegar as secretary of transportation.\n\nIn November 1975 Ford made the most talked-about changes in his administration. He dismissed Kissinger as head of the National Security Council. Ford also fired James R. Schlesinger, a critic of Kissinger’s policy of détente, and appointed Donald H. Rumsfeld to succeed him as secretary of defense. At the same time Ford nominated George Bush to replace William E. Colby as CIA director. When Ford made these changes, Vice President Rockefeller announced that he would not run for election with Ford in 1976. Butz resigned under fire in October 1976.\n\nFord made one appointment to the Supreme Court. William O. Douglas, who had served longer than any other Supreme Court justice, resigned in 1975. Ford nominated John Paul Stevens for the seat.\n\nThere were two assassination attempts on Ford during 1975. On September 5 Lynette Fromme pointed a gun at the president in Sacramento, California. Two weeks later Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at Ford in San Francisco, California. Ford was not harmed in either incident. In July 1976 a man who climbed over the White House fence was shot and killed by a guard.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nFord maintained the Nixon policy of détente with the Soviet Union and with mainland China. Kissinger continued to direct foreign policy, but he became a controversial figure during the Ford Administration. Critics charged Kissinger with unwarranted secrecy and with misuse of his power. In 1975 Kissinger succeeded in negotiating an agreement between Israel and Egypt that reopened the Suez Canal and established a neutral zone between the two nations’ forces.\n\nCongress denied Ford’s request for aid to Indochina during the closing months of the Vietnam War. When South Vietnam fell to the North in April 1975, Ford ordered the evacuation of remaining American personnel. The simultaneous evacuation of thousands of Vietnamese orphans and refugees and their resettlement in the United States were widely criticized. In 1976 Congress refused Ford’s request for aid to pro-Western forces fighting in Angola.\n\nPerhaps Ford’s greatest personal triumph in foreign affairs was his response to the seizure of the United States merchant ship Mayaguez by Cambodia in May 1975. Ford ordered United States forces to recover the crew and ship, and the operation was successful. In November 1974 Ford became the first American president to visit Japan. The Asian trip also included a stop in South Korea and a meeting in the Soviet Union with Communist Party leader Leonid Brezhnev. They reached a tentative agreement on arms control, but further negotiations were unproductive.\n\nDuring 1975 Ford met with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) heads of state in Brussels, Belgium, and later attended the signing of the agreement of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at Helsinki, Finland. Ford also attended an economic conference near Paris. At the conference a plan for stabilizing currencies was worked out. On his trips Ford met with leaders of several countries, including Egypt’s President Anwar el-Sadat, with whom the United States improved relations. Ford also visited China.\n\nThe 1976 Election\n\nFord announced his candidacy for election in July 1975. Former California Governor Ronald Reagan, popular among conservative Republicans, challenged Ford for the nomination. Both men won several primary elections. At the opening of the Republican convention in Kansas City, Missouri, neither had a majority of delegate votes. Ford won nomination on the first ballot, receiving 1,187 votes to 1,070 for Reagan.\n\nFord chose Robert J. Dole, a conservative senator from Kansas, as his vice presidential running mate. They ran on a platform that was fiscally conservative and less accommodating in foreign affairs. Despite Ford’s success in restoring integrity to the presidency and in strengthening the economy, he failed to win election to the office. In 1980 Ford was asked to run as Ronald Reagan’s vice president, but he decided against joining the ticket.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Ford retired from public life and joined the boards of directors of several corporations. He published his autobiography, A Time to Heal, in 1979. His presidential library and museum, both in Michigan, were dedicated in 1981. Ford died on December 26, 2006, in Rancho Mirage, California."
