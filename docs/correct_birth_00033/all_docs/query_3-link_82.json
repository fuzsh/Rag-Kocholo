        "meta_description": "Gerald Ford came to the Oval Office during a tumultuous chapter in U.S. history. Government confidence was wavering in the wake of Watergate and the following Presidential resignation, andÂ the Vietnam War raged on despite growing opposition at home.\n\nPresident Ford rose to the occasion and led with an impassioned dedication to doÂ what was best for the entire country. Despite its brevity, from August 1974 to January 1977, Ford's leadership in theÂ Oval Office is remembered for its courage and character during some of the nation's darkest hours.\n\nGerald R. Ford: A Test of CharacterÂ is a production of ARK MEDIA.\n\nÂ©2016 Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation and Secchia Family Foundation.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.",
