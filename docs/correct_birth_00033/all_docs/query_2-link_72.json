        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI – Richard Norton Smith is too modest to call this the definitive biography of President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nBut with more than 300,000 words gracing 832 comprehensive pages, he’s at least aiming to challenge the popular narrow view of America’s 38th president.\n\n“Hopefully what this book will do is get a lot of people to rethinking what they thought they knew about Ford,” Smith told MLive in an interview before unveiling the book Tuesday night at the Ford Presidential Museum.\n\n“An Ordinary Man,” retailing around $40 after its release Tuesday, is full of surprises and factoids that rely partly on new material uncovered after Ford’s death in 2006.\n\nOne harrowing example is his baby book. There’s a passage inside about his first car ride in 1913, which was with his mother shortly after he was born in Nebraska. Dorothy was fleeing Ford’s abusive biological father, Leslie Lynch King Sr., who had threatened to kill her two days prior.\n\n“Baby’s first automobile ride was an escape,” Smith said.\n\nDorothy relocated near her parents in Grand Rapids, where she eventually met Gerald Ford Sr. The young couple married in 1917, changed the future president’s name, and instilled in him honesty and integrity.\n\n“He went through life not only looking for the good in people but assuming that there was good in everyone,” Smith said.\n\nSmith, 69, has led five presidential museums, including Ford’s from 1996 to 2001, and this “cradle to grave” opus is the culmination of 10 years, 170 interviews and 40 drafts.\n\n“This was the book I was born to write,” Smith said.\n\nFord is remembered as America’s accidental president, the only unelected commander-in-chief. After Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace in August 1976, Ford assumed the office, just months after being appointed vice president when Nixon’s resigned.\n\nOf all his moves in 29 months at the helm, Ford is most remembered for pardoning Nixon of any wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal.\n\nFord was trying to heal the nation by moving past dark times, yet he paid a political price when he narrowly lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter. Although, wiping Watergate from the national psyche is looked upon more favorably by historians today.\n\nBut Smith, who once worked for Ford and eulogized him at his funeral, sees “good ol’ Jerry” as much more than the pardon and a point of trivia.\n\n“Ford is a much more consequential president than just the guy who recovered trust after Watergate,” Smith said.\n\nHis long-term accomplishments include sensible economic deregulation, Smith said, and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which “planted the seeds” for the Soviet Union’s collapse.\n\nBut it’s the stories of Ford’s modesty and humanity that shine throughout “An Ordinary Man.” Democrat Lyndon Johnson was a heated rival of Ford’s in Congress, but Ford was the first person to phone Johnson after a massive heart attack in 1972.\n\nInside his safely Republican congressional district in West Michigan, Ford never got less than 60% of the vote but still came home every weekend to serve his constituents, Smith said. He once personally delivered a check to a local mobile home resident who had stopped receiving government benefits because of a bureaucratic snafu.\n\nThen there’s the day in 1975 when Ford signed a bill creating the national child support collection system.\n\nAlthough he witnessed a nasty child support battle between his mother and birth father, Smith said, Ford kept that story to himself, forgoing political opportunity as the modest Midwesterner molded in Michigan.\n\n“He turns out to be far from the vanilla, one-dimensional character that I think even some of his admirers assume,” Smith said. “He’s a lot more complicated, he’s frankly a lot more interesting, and ultimately, he’s a lot more contemporary. He’s a lot more relevant.”\n\nSmith will speak about his book April 17 at the University of Michigan, April 18 at Albion College and May 19 at Grand Valley State University.\n\nRead more from MLive:\n\nMarch’s 5% inflation rate lowest in nearly two years\n\nMichigan’s anti-texting and driving laws may get a modern facelift\n\nWhitmer says she’s a ‘climate optimist’ in conference keynote"
