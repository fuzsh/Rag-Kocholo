        "text": "NBA veteran JR Smith will make his collegiate golf debut for North Carolina A&T this weekend, the school announced.\n\nSmith, 36, is a 16-year NBA veteran who enrolled at the school in Greensboro over the summer. He joined the golf team as a freshman walk-on. The Aggies are set to participate in the Phoenix Invitational hosted by Elon University at Alamance Country Club, Oct. 11-12.\n\nAnd while Smith, a two-time NBA champion with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers, certainly isn’t your average college freshman, he still had to qualify just like all A&T golfers.\n\nSmith qualified for the Phoenix Invitational by one stroke, according to the school.\n\n“I’m hoping it puts pressure on the two guys playing with him,” said A&T men’s golf coach Richard Watkins. “I’m hoping it does not affect him. You would think a guy like JR is used to having eyes on him.”\n\nWatkins said that even though Smith has played on the biggest stage in basketball, tournament golf play would be a learning curve.\n\n“He has a good enough golf game to put up some good numbers,” he said. “But this is what I tell people. If you want to find out how good a golfer really is, put the word tournament or money in front of the round. Playing when there is nothing on the line is one thing. But, put meaning to it, and the heart rate changes. The grip on the club changes, and we get to see who you really are.”"
