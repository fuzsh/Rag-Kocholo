        "text": "It’s been a quiet month for J.R. Smith, whose time as a Cleveland Cavalier has all but come to an end.\n\nSmith, who became a fan favorite while helping Cleveland end a 52-year title drought, has been on leave since suggesting the organization was tanking amidst early season struggles and a decreased playing role. Since then, the Cavs have made no secret about his availability on the trading block, although interest has been lukewarm to take on his hefty contract this season.\n\nBut it’s a shooter’s league and if J.R. does one thing really well, it’s shoot the ball. He’s certainly had dry spells and slumps, something not unique to him or any other proclaimed shooter. And as the year trudges on, teams around the league will be looking for veteran help to overcome injuries and bolster depth in preparation for the playoffs, which fares to be good news for his camp as well.\n\nWhether the Cavs agree on a buyout or eventually find a trade partner for Smith, the question is more complex than where the right fit is – rather, what is the right fit for one of the NBA’s most variant journeymen.\n\nSomething to play for\n\nThe best version of Smith is one who has a defined role on a team with something to play for – in short, a playoff contender. He’s a specialist who should be utilized off the bench, playing in meaningful games as such. If he can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, you can forget about him buying in and that’s where his destructive behavior manifests.\n\nThe correlation between Smith’s best shooting seasons and playoff success has been impressive. Seven of eight of Smith’s career-best three-point shooting seasons were all years his teams made the playoffs. He shot 39% or better from three in four playoff appearances with Denver (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011) and three times with Cleveland (2015, 2016, 2018).\n\nSmith’s efficiency was most notably boosted when he was traded from New York to Cleveland during the 2014-15 season, as the move from the lottery-bound Knicks to the Finals-bound Cavs raised his three-point percentage from 36% to 39%. As a result, his scoring output also increased by almost two points per game. He carried his momentum from the 2014-15 season into 2015-16 where the Cavs eventually took home basketball’s biggest prize.\n\nEstablished leadership\n\nEven with the best version of Smith, there’s likely to be some form of on and off the floor distraction that tags along. That’s just who he is. From riding a hoverboard into the arena prior to a Finals game to his game one clock run-out gaffe from last season’s Finals, teams have to understand what they are getting with him, be willing to take the bad with the good and have the personnel to deal with it.\n\nThat’s easier said than done. When it comes to strong leadership, it doesn’t get much better than playing next to LeBron James to get teammates to fall in line. But the Cavs lacked strong leadership outside of James and struggled with identifying their culture in his absence, as was evident this season sans James and former head coach Ty Lue. Anyone looking to acquire Smith needs to have that established, both on the player and coaching levels.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nThere’s no secret that Smith had his biggest off the floor issues while playing in New York. He admitted such and made a point of changing his behavior by committing to stay in Cleveland through the off-season two summers ago. Since being in Cleveland, Smith has gotten married and had another child and is certainly living a more measured lifestyle than he did during his time with New York. Smith isn’t the first and won’t be the last to succumb to the lure of attractive nightlife of an NBA city. But make no mistake that Cleveland being a small market was critical in helping him stay on track.\n\nThere are plenty more factors teams will consider if they want to get involved in the Swish Sweepstakes. Money will be one of the biggest issues, as Smith will have close to $14 million left on his contract this season – most certainly not chump change for contenders already in and flirting with the luxury tax.\n\nSmith is one of the most polarizing players in the league, but there’s a reason the former Sixth Man of the Year is in his 15th season and still able to compete at the highest level. In a league that glorifies three-point shooting and personalities as much as the NBA, there’s certainly a place for J.R. Smith.\n\nAny team looking to render his services has to be aware of the tricky recipe necessary to get the best version of Smith – making the money work may be the least of that complicated formula."
