        "text": "by Ryne Nelson\n\nThe Nuggets have their shooting guard of the future locked-up. This from the Nuggets’ press release:\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have re-signed G J.R. Smith to a multi-year contract, Nuggets Vice President of Basketball Operations Mark Warkentien announced today. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released.\n\nSmith’s offseason has been anything but normal. Very few teams have shown interest in the 6-6 multi-talented guard. Smith even told the Denver Post he had not been approached with serious contract talks.\n\nThe re-signing could prove to be a serious coup if Smith steps-up nicely into a starting role in 2010."
