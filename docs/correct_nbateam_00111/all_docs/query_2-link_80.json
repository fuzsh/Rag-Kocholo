        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Isaac Okoro is the Cavs’ best point-of-attack defender, yet he’s the player most likely to be moved this offseason.\n\nThe Cavs have yet to make any offseason moves outside of re-signing Donovan Mitchell to a three-year, $150.3 million extension, and are eyeing an extension for Evan Mobley.\n\n“I have great belief in the talent here,” Cavs president of basketball operations Koby Altman said during his end-of-season press conference. “If I didn’t, I would say we’re going to look at all these different things and maybe breaking up the core and trying to bring other guys in here. I think around the margins. How do we get better? How do we maximize the talent we have in-house? And really try to pull levers that we have here from every angle that we can look at to maximize what we have in-house.”\n\nMore Cavs coverage\n\nCavs, Evan Mobley agree to massive contract extension\n\nEvan Mobley’s new contract proves he is just as important to the Cavs as Donovan Mitchell — Jimmy Watkins\n\nCavs end summer league on a high-note with victory over Indiana Pacers, 100-93\n\nBringing Kenny Atkinson to Cleveland as the next head coach was a main emphasis to improve the players already on the roster because of his player development resume and acumen.\n\nWhile there is no expectation for the Cavs to make a move in the weak free agency class this offseason, there is potential for the organization to improve around the margins by trading rotation pieces.\n\nWith the goal of keeping the Core Four intact, especially after Darius Garland confirmed that he doesn’t want to be traded and Atkinson having a previous relationship with Jarrett Allen from their time together in Brooklyn, the options for growth rely on smaller moves.\n\nOkoro, being a restricted free agent, is a trade option. The 23-year-old was offered an $11.8 million qualifying contract in June and has yet to re-sign as he seemingly shops the market for a larger contract or a bigger role.\n\nWhen the Cavs were still rebuilding as Okoro entered the league, he was a starter and tasked with holding down the defensive front, while Garland was the leader on offense before Mobley joined the squad a year later. Since the Cavs added Mitchell and Max Strus, Okoro’s starts dipped from more than 60 in each of his first two seasons to less than 50 for the previous two years.\n\nThe organizations with the cap space to give Okoro an offer that rivals the Cavs’ qualifying offer would be the Pistons, Jazz, and Nets. Detroit is now home to former Cavs head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who rebuilt the Cavs by utilizing the defensive prowess of Okoro, Mobley, and Allen as the identity of the team in an era that mainly focuses on offense. Okoro could be interested in rejoining Bickerstaff in a larger role with the Pistons.\n\nThe Cavs stand to gain the most immediately from a sign and trade with the Nets that would send Okoro to Brooklyn for Dorian Finney-Smith.\n\n“I know I’m gonna be good regardless,” Finney-Smith said of trade rumors. The Nets originally acquired him with Spencer Dinwiddie and a 2029 first-rounder in the 2023 trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Mavericks. “If I’m here, I’m here. If I’m not, I’m not. So I just try to be wherever my feet are at. So I’m a Net right now.”\n\nThe negative of this trade is that the Cavs, who are already limited in draft capital for the foreseeable future due to their blockbuster trade to acquire Mitchell two summers ago, would more than likely have to add a second-round pick to intrigue the Nets enough to give up Finney-Smith, with other teams vying for his services.\n\nThe 31-year-old is scheduled to make $14.9 million this coming season with a player option for 2025-26 that would allow the Cavs to gauge how Finney-Smith fits.\n\nThe conversation then becomes whether the Cavs will be getting more by gaining Finney-Smith while losing their premiere perimeter defender in Okoro, who has room to grow as a younger guard in the league.\n\nCurrently, the Cavs are looking to grow in size, spacing, and shooting, especially from beyond the arc.\n\nFinney-Smith is 6-foot-7. Okoro is 6-foot-5. Finney-Smith can guard multiple positions without as much of a height differential. During the regular season, Okoro had a 110.7 defensive rating, while Finney-Smith’s was 113.2.\n\nBut the main topic of discussion is the offensive growth that the Cavs could receive by adding Finney-Smith, especially during the playoffs.\n\nAlthough Okoro may have a better field goal percentage (46.7%) for his career and a better 3-point percentage during recent seasons, Finney-Smith’s averages improve drastically when he’s in the playoffs, while Okoro’s do the opposite.\n\nFor the past two years, Okoro has been played off the court because of his lack of shooting, even if he was the best defender on the floor. In the playoff series against the Magic and Celtics, Okoro shot just 30% from the field on shots taken with the nearest defender six or more feet away — classified as wide open by NBA.com’s stats database — with all of these attempts coming from 3-point range.\n\nOkoro has played in 17 playoff games during his career, starting in nine, and averages 38.7% from the field and 27.1% from 3-point range. Finney-Smith averages 44.6% from the floor and 41.7% from beyond the arc in the 35 playoff games he’s played in, starting each contest.\n\nKenny Atkinson has preached that he hopes to enhance the culture that the Cavs have already created, improving the offense while maintaining the defensive prowess that has had them in the top 10 in defensive rating for the past three seasons.\n\nThe Cavs’ ambition is to reach the Eastern Conference finals and NBA Finals. It is still to be determined if they will prioritize Okoro’s known defensive ability, look to pursue the shooting potential with a sign and trade Finney-Smith, or go in a different direction."
