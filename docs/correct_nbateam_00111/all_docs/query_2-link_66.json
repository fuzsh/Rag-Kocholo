        "text": "STARKVILLE – Former Mississippi State softball players Brylie St. Clair and Madisyn Kennedy broke out the bats in the fourth week of the WPF and AFP schedules. Combined, the pair tallied 24 total bases on seven extra-base hits.\n\nKennedy began to heat up on Wednesday, launching a solo homer in the Florida Vibe's 8-4 victory against the Chattanooga Steam.\n\nOn Saturday against the New York Rise, she provided the spark the Vibe offense needed. Trailing 4-0 in the bottom of the sixth, Kennedy hit a three-run homer as the Vibe rallied to tie the ballgame. They would go on to win 7-4, and Kennedy drew a pair of walks in the ballgame as well. The next day, she did it again, driving in two with a homer in the fourth to extend the Vibe's lead to 5-1.\n\nSt. Clair's efforts were more concentrated. The Texas Monarchs went 2-2 against the Hub City Adelitas in a series that had a little bit of everything. The Monarchs lost the opening game in five innings due to a run rule, but St. Clair's club responded with a 9-5 victory on Friday night. St. Clair walked and singled in that game.\n\nOn Saturday, the former Bulldog was in the spotlight. St. Clair reached base four times in five trips and scored three times. She doubled to open the ballgame, and later drove in a run with her second double in the second inning. She tripled home a run in the sixth to extend the Monarch's lead to 6-4, but the Adelitas forced extra innings. In the eighth, St. Clair tripled again and would score the winning run on a walk-off homer as the Monarch's claimed an 8-6 victory.\n\nSt. Clair batted .500 on the week with an 1.100 slugging percentage. Her efforts raised her season batting average nearly 80 points, and her season slugging percentage climbed 221 points. She now boasts an .882 OPS for the year. Kennedy, meanwhile, collected more RBIs last week than she had in the first three weeks of the season combined. She finished the week with a 1.256 OPS and now carries a .891 OPS for the year.\n\nChloe Malau'ulu's Oklahoma City Spark played just twice this week, meeting a roster of Athletes Unlimited players on Friday and Saturday night. The Spark won both games by a combined score of 10-2. On Saturday, Malau'ulu drew a pair of walks and scored twice.\n\nProfessional softball in the United States consists of three different leagues. Two play with traditional, location-based teams, the Association of Fastpitch Professionals (AFP) and Women's Pro Fastpitch (WPF). Two Bulldogs are currently playing in each of these leagues. The third organization is Athletes Unlimited (AU), which does not have traditional teams. Instead, athletes compete as individuals earning fantasy sports style points. Teams are re-drafted by the leading players each week in Athletes Unlimited, where one Bulldog is active. AU begins play in late July.\n\nBulldogs In The Show\n\nMadisyn Kennedy – Florida Vibe (AFP)\n\nOpponent GP-GS AVG AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI BB HBP SO SF SH SB OBP SLG PO A E FLD 7/8 – W, 5-4 vs. Chattanooga Steam 1-1 .000 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 .000 .000 3 0 0 1.000 7/9 – W, 8-4 vs. Chattanooga Steam 1-1 .333 3 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 .333 1.333 3 0 0 1.000 7/10 – L, 3-5 vs. Chattanooga Steam 1-1 .000 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 .000 2 0 0 1.000 7/11 – W, 3-1 vs. Chattanooga Steam DNP -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 7/12 – L, 7-12 vs. New York Rise 1-1 .333 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 .500 .333 2 0 0 1.000 7/13 – W, 7-4 vs. New York Rise 1-1 .500 2 2 1 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 .750 2.000 2 0 0 1.000 7/14 – W. 8-5 vs. New York Rise 1-1 .333 3 1 1 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 .333 1.333 0 1 0 1.000 Weekly Totals 6-6 .267 15 5 4 0 0 3 6 3 0 6 0 0 0 .389 .867 12 1 0 1.000 Season Totals 17-17 .214 43 12 10 2 0 4 11 7 0 14 1 0 0 .333 .558 33 1 1 .970\n\nChloe Malau'ulu – Oklahoma City Spark (AFP)\n\nOpponent GP-GS AVG AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI BB HBP SO SF SH SB OBP SLG PO A E FLD 7/12 – W, 4-0 vs. Athletes Unlimited 1-1 .000 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 .000 0 0 0 -- 7/13 – W, 6-2 vs. Athletes Unlimited 1-1 .000 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 .667 .000 0 0 0 -- Weekly Totals 2-2 .000 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 .333 .000 0 0 0 -- Season Totals 15-13 .250 36 6 9 0 1 2 3 2 0 10 0 0 1 .289 .389 15 0 0 1.000\n\nBrylie St. Clair – Texas Monarchs (WPF)\n\nOpponent GP-GS AVG AB R H 2B 3B HR RBI BB HBP SO SF SH SB OBP SLG PO A E FLD 7/11 – L, 1-9 (5 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-1 .000 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 .333 .000 3 0 0 1.000 7/12 – W, 9-5 vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-1 .333 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 .500 .333 0 0 0 -- 7/13 – W, 8-6 (8 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-1 .800 5 3 4 2 2 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 .800 2.000 1 0 0 1.000 7/14 – L, 7-15 (6 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-0 -- 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1.000 -- 0 0 0 -- Weekly Totals 4-3 .500 10 4 5 2 2 0 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 .615 1.100 4 0 0 1.000 Season Totals 15-13 .282 39 10 11 3 2 0 3 8 2 5 1 1 2 .420 .462 23 0 0 1.000\n\nAspen Wesley – Texas Monarchs (WPF)\n\nOpponent APP-GS ERA W-L CG SHO SV IP H R ER BB SO 2B 3B HR AB B/AVG PO A E FLD 7/11 – L, 1-9 (5 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-1 9.33 L 0 0 0 3.0 6 4 4 0 1 2 0 1 14 .429 0 1 0 1.000 7/12 – W, 9-5 vs. Hub City Adelitas DNP -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 7/13 – W, 8-6 (8 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas 1-0 7.00 -- 0 0 0 2.0 2 2 2 0 3 0 0 1 8 .250 0 0 0 -- 7/14 – L, 7-15 (6 inn.) vs. Hub City Adelitas DNP -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Weekly Totals 2-1 8.40 0-1 0 0 0 5.0 8 6 6 0 4 2 0 2 22 .364 0 1 0 1.000 Season Totals 7-3 2.65 2-2 1 0 0 31.2 30 12 12 6 14 7 1 3 121 .248 0 4 0 1.000\n\nFor more information on the Bulldog softball program, follow on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram by searching \"HailStateSB.\""
