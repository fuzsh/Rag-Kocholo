        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- J.R. Smith's future remains uncertain after he declined his player option with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2015-16 season.\n\nWhile he's been forced to watch other players ink deals, the uneasiness doesn't seem to be bothering him much. Smith recently joined Cleveland Cavaliers director of player development Phil Handy and newly-signed Miami Heat swingman Gerald Green as instructors at the Guam Basketball Clinics, part of Handy's 94 Feet of Game program.\n\n\"I just want to be somewhere I can make a difference,\" Smith said of his contract situation according to the Pacific Daily News. \"I don't want to be somewhere I can't have an affect on the team.\"\n\nSmith, 29, arrived in a three-team midseason trade and helped Cleveland surge up the standings in the second half of the season. He averaged 12.7 points and shot 39 percent from 3-point range during the regular season with the Cavs. But was a playoff enigma -- his much-needed scoring outbursts mixed with a two-game suspension and a dreadful Finals performance where he shot 31 percent from the field.\n\nA full-time starter in the regular season, Smith came off the bench for much of the postseason run, giving way to Iman Shumpert.\n\n\"I would love to be a starter, but it depends on the situation and what team I'm on,\" Smith said. \"Cleveland is in a situation where they don't really need me to start. I can come off the bench and bring the energy and stuff like that.\"\n\nSmith's career has been dotted with costly shenanigans that have forced teams to shy away in free agency. Others in the past have given up entirely, but LeBron James and head coach David Blatt have been staunch in their support. The 2013 Sixth Man of the Year has a unique ability to ignite the team's second unit and his catch-and-shoot stroke helps provide spacing offensively, something the Cavs covet.\n\nFor those reasons and other salary cap realities, Smith re-signing with the Cavs still seems likely. In Las Vegas a few weeks ago for the NBA players' union summer meeting, Smith told our Joe Vardon that he would like to return, even if it means settling for less than the $6.4 million he walked away from in June.\n\n\"I definitely want to come back to Cleveland,\" Smith said. \"The coaches, the team, everything about the situation, it's perfect for me.\"\n\nIt's been a busy summer for the Cavs as they have re-signed Shumpert, James, Kevin Love and Matthew Dellavedova. Most recently, the team traded Brendan Haywood and Mike Miller to the Portland Trail Blazers for two separate trade exceptions, which expire one year from the acquisition date. The Cavaliers have also agreed to deals with a pair of free agents -- Mo Williams and Richard Jefferson -- hoping to boost the lowest scoring second unit from this past season.\n\nBut Smith continues to wait.\n\nHe's keeping his mind off this summer's negotiations, but staying close to the basketball court. In the Pacific with Green, a longtime friend who inked a one-year deal with the Heat despite his numbers slipping this past season, the duo demonstrated drills and played defense against the kids.\n\nOf course, Smith also carved out time to dazzle on the court with a dunking show that was posted to Instagram."
