        "text": "What is J.R. Smith's Net Worth?\n\nJ.R. Smith is an American former professional basketball player who has a net worth of $35 million. J.R. Smith was drafted straight out of high school in 2004 by the New Orleans Hornets as the 18th overall pick. Known for his sharpshooting abilities, he has played for several NBA teams, including the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and briefly with the Los Angeles Lakers. His career is highlighted by winning two NBA championships, first with the Cavaliers in 2016 and then with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nThroughout his career, Smith was recognized for his scoring prowess, particularly from the three-point range, and his high-energy style of play. He received the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2013 while playing for the Knicks. Despite his on-court successes, Smith also drew attention for his unpredictable behavior and various on-and-off-court controversies.\n\nEarly Life\n\nEarl Joseph \"J.R.\" Smith III was born on September 9, 1985, in Freehold Borough, New Jersey. He grew up in the Clarksburg section of Millstone Township and spent five years in high school. He attended Steinert High for the first semester of his freshman year and then McCorristin Catholic High for the next. He was permitted to transfer to Lakewood High having not participated in sports for either school where he repeated his freshman year. J.R. played two seasons of basketball for the school before moving on to Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in 2002. He became a highly rated football and baseball player, but he focused strictly on basketball as a senior. Smith committed to the University of North Carolina after a long recruiting battle, but after winning co-MVP with Dwight Howard at the 2004 McDonald's All-American Game, decided to forgo college and enter the NBA Draft.\n\nNBA Career\n\nWith the 18th overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected J.R. Smith. He spent two years with the Hornets. He played moderately well, earning Western Conference Rookie of the Month honors three times during his first year with the team. He was traded to the Denver Nuggets in 2006. He played well for the team setting a franchise record for the number of successful three-pointers (11) during a single game. He spent one year with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls in Asia in 2011. He reportedly signed a $3 million, one-year deal to play with the Golden Bulls, a single-season record for a Chinese league contract at that time. In June 2011, he sued the Golden Bulls for failing to pay $1 million in salary. The team claims they withheld his salary for missing practices and faking an ankle injury.\n\nSmith returned to the NBA to play for the New York Knicks ahead of the 2012 season. In 2013, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nSmith joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in January of 2015 as the result of a three-team trade involving the Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder. He was instrumental in the team sweeping the Hawks to reach the NBA Finals where they fell short to the Golden State Warriors in six games. In 2016, J.R. Smith started all of Cleveland's playoff games once again helping them to the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. This time, the Cavaliers won the series in seven games for the franchise's first NBA Championship after overcoming a 3-1 deficit.\n\nSmith struggled the next year, and when LeBron James left the team in free agency to head to the Los Angeles Lakers, J.R. joined him after being waived by the Cavs in July of 2019. He won his second NBA Championship when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games.\n\nContracts & Career Earnings\n\nIn 2013, Smith signed a three-year, $18 million contract with the New York Knicks. He signed a two-year, $10.4 million deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2015, and then a three-year, $57 million contract with the team in 2016.\n\nOver the course of his 18-year NBA career, J.R. Smith earned more than $90.2 million in salary alone.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nJ.R. Smith married Jewel Harris in August of 2016, and the couple has three daughters together. Smith also has one daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nDuring his playing days, Smith was known as perhaps the most heavily tattooed player in the league saying he lost count around \"70 something.\" He modeled for Mike and Supreme in 2018 and had the Supreme logo tattooed on his calf."
