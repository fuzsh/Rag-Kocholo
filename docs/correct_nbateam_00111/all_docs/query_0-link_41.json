Smith played high school basketball at New Jersey basketball powerhouse Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark. He entered the NBA out of high school after being selected in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft with the 18th overall pick by the New Orleans Hornets. He has also played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Los Angeles Lakers, as well as for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). In 2016, Smith won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers, and later won another championship in 2020 with the Lakers, playing with LeBron James in both of them.\n\nIn 2021, Smith enrolled at North Carolina A&T State University, where he joined their Aggies golf team.\n\nHigh school[]\n\nBorn in Freehold Borough, New Jersey, Smith grew up in the Clarksburg section of Millstone Township, New Jersey. Before attending high school, Smith attended Millstone Middle School and graduated in 1999. From there, he moved on to Steinert High School and McCorristin Catholic High School before transferring to Lakewood High School. Smith played high school basketball for the first time at Lakewood High School. He would later transfer to Saint Benedict's Preparatory School and play basketball there as well. During his career there, he would average over 27 points, six rebounds, and five assists. Smith was highly rated in football and also played baseball. He focused strictly on basketball as a senior. In the Fall of 2003, Smith signed a letter of intent to play at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nIn April 2004, following a 25–point performance at the McDonald's All–American Game (in which he was named game Co–MVP with Dwight Howard), Smith decided to forgo college and declare himself eligible for the NBA Draft.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (2004–2006)[]\n\nJ.R. was selected eighteenth overall, in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft, by the New Orleans Hornets—one of nine players who were drafted that year straight out of high school.\n\nIn his rookie season, Smith averaged 10.3 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game in 76 games (56 starts). Smith participated in the Sprite Rising Stars Slam Dunk Competition in 2005, finishing behind Amar'e Stoudemire and the eventual winner, Josh Smith. The Hornets finished the season at 18–64 and failed to qualify for the playoffs. Smith was named the Western Conference Rookie of the Month three consecutive times in January–March of 2005.\n\nIn his second season in New Orleans, Smith saw his numbers decline across the board, averaging 7.7 points, 2 rebounds, and 1.1 assists in 55 games (25 starts). The Hornets spent part of the season in Oklahoma City because of Hurricane Katrina. The Hornets finished 38–44, helped by the playmaking ability of eventual Rookie of the Award winner Chris Paul; despite the 20–game improvement, they still missed the playoffs. Smith fell out of favor with Hornets coach Byron Scott due to a poor work ethic. He began the 2005–06 season as the starting Shooting Guard and ended it out of the rotation.\n\nDenver Nuggets (2006–2011)[]\n\nOn July 14, 2006, the Hornets traded Smith and Forward–Center P.J. Brown to the Chicago Bulls for Center Tyson Chandler. On July 20, Smith was traded again, this time to the Denver Nuggets for Guard Howard Eisley and two 2007 second–round draft picks.\n\nOn December 16, 2006, Smith was involved in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl. The brawl began when Mardy Collins flagrantly fouled Smith on a fast break. Smith was suspended for 10 games. On February 20, 2007, Smith suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee which required knee surgery. He missed several weeks. Smith averaged 13 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in his first season with the Nuggets.\n\nSmith's first trip to the playoffs during the 2006–07 season, with the Nuggets, proved disappointing. Smith, a 39% three–point shooter during the regular season, failed to connect on any three–point shots in the first four games and was criticized for poor decision–making by coach George Karl. After Game 4, Karl informed reporters of his plan to bench Smith for all of Game 5. Karl said, \"He's done\", and explained his frustrations over Smith's poor judgment to shoot a three late in the game trailing 93–89 with 25.7 seconds left, \"I have no idea what planet that came from.\" Karl told the Associated Press that he had drawn up the play to give the ball to either Allen Iverson or Carmelo Anthony. Karl did not stop there and continued venting over Smith's poor play, \"And then, of course the one with eight seconds to go, from 50 feet, I just love the dignity of the game being insulted right in front of me.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2007, Smith was involved in an incident at a Denver nightclub. The Nuggets suspended him for the first three regular season games of 2007–08 season for his role in the incident. During the season, Smith averaged 12.3 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.7 assists.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Smith established career–highs for field goal percentage (.461) and 3–point percentage (.403). During the 2008–09 season, he averaged 15.2 points over 81 games (18 starts), finishing second in voting for the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award behind Jason Terry. In February 2009, he participated in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, finishing third. On April 13, 2009, Smith had a career–high 45 points and franchise–best 11 3–pointers to help the Nuggets clinch the Northwest Division title and home–court edge in the playoffs for the first time in 21 years with a 118–98 win over the Sacramento Kings.\n\nOn December 23, 2009, Smith scored a season–high 41 points against the Atlanta Hawks, becoming first NBA player ever to record multiple games of 10+ 3–pointers. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging a then career–high 15.4 points per game. In 2010–11, he averaged 12.3 points and 2.2 assists as the Nuggets' sixth man. Smith's tenure with the Nuggets ended in September 2011 due to the NBA lockout. A fan favorite in Denver for his 3–point shooting and electric dunks, Smith often drew the ire of coach Karl for his befuddling shot selection.\n\nZhejiang Golden Bulls (2011–2012)[]\n\nIn September 2011, due to the NBA lockout, Smith signed a one–year deal with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). In accordance with CBA rules, Smith's contract with the Golden Bulls did not include an opt–out clause that would allow him to return to the NBA following the conclusion of the lockout. His deal was estimated to be worth around $3 million, the highest in league history. In 32 games for Zhejiang, he averaged 34.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 2.5 steals per game. On February 1, 2012, he scored a season–high 60 points with 14 3–pointers in a 122–110 win over the Qingdao Eagles. He had four 50+ point games during the season.\n\nNew York Knicks (2012–2015)[]\n\nOn February 17, 2012, Smith signed with the New York Knicks. He appeared in 35 games for the Knicks to finish the regular season, before appearing in all five of the Knicks' postseason games.\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Smith re–signed with the Knicks. In 2012–13, he averaged a career–high 18.1 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 2.7 assists over 33.5 minutes in 80 games off the bench. He earned Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors for the period ending March 31, after posting three consecutive 30–point efforts off the bench, becoming the first NBA player to accomplish the feat in over 23 years. He was subsequently named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year, becoming just the third player in franchise history to win the award, joining Anthony Mason and John Starks.\n\nOn July 11, 2013, Smith re–signed with the Knicks. He missed the first five games of the 2013–14 season for violating the NBA's anti–drug policy. On March 26, he hit nine 3–pointers against the Sacramento Kings, tying the Knicks' franchise record. On April 4, he scored a season–high 32 points with eight 3–pointers in a 90–89 loss to the Washington Wizards. Two days later, in a 102–91 loss to the Miami Heat, Smith broke an NBA record of 21 three–pointers taken in a single game, a mark set in 2005 by Damon Stoudamire. Smith hit 10–of–22 3–point shots against the Heat, setting a franchise record for 3–pointers made and finishing with 32 points for the second straight game.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2015–2019)[]\n\n2014–15 season[]\n\nOn January 5, 2015, Smith was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three–team trade that involved his former team the Knicks and the Oklahoma City Thunder. On April 27, 2015, Smith was suspended for the first two games of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Chicago Bulls after he swung his arm and made contact with the head of Boston Celtics forward Jae Crowder in Game 4 of their first–round series against Boston. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the top–seeded Atlanta Hawks, Smith made eight 3–pointers and scored 28 points in a 97–89 victory. He helped the Cavaliers sweep the Hawks to reach the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. During Cleveland's NBA Finals run in the 2015 Playoffs, Smith appeared in 18 games (four starts), averaging 12.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 31.1 minutes per game.\n\n2015–16 season: First championship[]\n\nOn September 2, 2015, Smith re–signed with the Cavaliers. Smith played in 77 games (all starts) with Cleveland in the 2015–16 regular season, averaging 12.4 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.1 steals in 30.7 minutes. He ranked seventh in the league in 3–pointers made (204), setting a franchise single–season record. He also shot .400 from beyond the arc, which was tied for 18th–best in the NBA. Smith led Cleveland in steal–to–turnover ratio (1.37) and scored 10 or more points 50 times and 20 or more points 11 times. During Cleveland's playoff run, Smith started in all 21 games, averaging 11.5 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.2 steals in 34.8 minutes per game. He made a franchise playoff–record 65 3–pointers, which were also the fourth–most threes made by any NBA player in a single postseason. Smith scored in double figures in each of the last five games of the NBA Finals, as Cleveland went 4–1 over that stretch against the defending NBA champion Warriors, becoming the first team in NBA Finals history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit, and took home the franchise's first ever NBA title.\n\n2016–17 season[]\n\nOn October 15, 2016, Smith re–signed with the Cavaliers. After a contract stalemate that had consumed nearly the first three weeks of training camp, Smith and the Cavaliers reached an agreement on a four–year deal worth $57 million. On November 1, in a win over the Houston Rockets, Smith hit his 344th three–pointer, passing Damon Jones for ninth place on the team's all–time list. On November 18, he hit three 3–pointers against the Detroit Pistons to move past Dirk Nowitzki into 15th place on the NBA's career list for 3–pointers. On December 13, Smith, having been in a season–long shooting slump, scored 17 of his season–high 23 points in the first half of the Cavaliers' 103–86 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He came into the game shooting a career–low 31 percent from the field and 32 percent on 3–pointers, the lowest mark since his rookie season with New Orleans. He finished the game with 8–of–17 from the field and 6–of–10 on 3s, passing Dale Ellis (1,719) for 14th on the career three–pointer list. On December 20, in a win over the Milwaukee Bucks, Smith suffered a fractured right thumb that required surgery. Three days later, he was ruled out for 12–14 weeks. He made his return to the line–up on March 9 against the Detroit Pistons. Smith helped the Cavaliers go 12–1 over the first three rounds of the playoffs to reach the NBA Finals for a third straight season. There, the Cavaliers faced the Warriors for a third consecutive season in the Finals, but lost the series in five games.\n\n2017–18 season[]\n\nSmith struggled over the first 10 games of the 2017–18 season. He got it going on November 7, scoring a season–high 20 points on 5–of–7 3–pointers in a 124–119 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, passing Rashard Lewis (1,787) for 14th place on the NBA's career 3–pointers made list. On December 14, in a 121–112 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Smith passed Chauncey Billups (1,830) for 11th place on the NBA's career 3–pointers made list. On March 2, 2018, Smith was suspended by the Cavaliers for one game for throwing a bowl of soup at assistant coach Damon Jones. During Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the defending champion Warriors, their fourth consecutive Finals meeting, Smith got a free–throw rebound with 4.7 seconds left in regulation time. The game was tied, meaning that a field goal would have won the game. Smith, apparently confused and thinking that the Cavaliers were winning, attempted to dribble out the clock before realizing his error and passing to George Hill with 1.2 seconds left in front of a visibly irate LeBron James, but Hill's shot was blocked by Draymond Green. The Cavaliers lost 124–114 in overtime. In a post–game interview, Smith initially claimed to have known that it was a tie game. He later backtracked, saying, \"After thinking about it a lot... I can't say I was sure of anything at that point.\" The Cavaliers went on to lose the series in a four–game sweep.\n\n2018–19 season[]\n\nCleveland began the 2018–19 season with a 2–13 record after LeBron James left the team (for the second time) in free agency for the Los Angeles Lakers. Head coach Tyronn Lue had been fired after an 0–6 start, the team was suffering injuries to All–Star Kevin Love and others, and Smith's role had been reduced. On November 20, 2018, the Cavaliers announced that Smith \"will no longer be with team as the organization works with J.R. and his representation regarding his future.\" A day earlier, he had accused the team of not trying to win, saying their goal was to \"develop [young players] and lose to get lottery picks.\"\n\nOn July 15, 2019, he was waived by the Cavaliers.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2020)[]\n\nOn June 29, 2020, Smith was reportedly signed by the Los Angeles Lakers, and on July 1, 2020, the signing was claimed official and Smith signed for the remainder of the 2019–20 season. He reunited with former Cavaliers teammate LeBron James. On July 30, he made his debut for the Lakers, recording no points and one foul in a 103–101 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On August 3, Smith logged his first points for the Lakers, grabbing four points in a 116–108 win over the Utah Jazz. On August 13, he recorded a season–high 11 points, along with one rebound and two assists, in a 122–136 loss to the Sacramento Kings. On August 20, he recorded a playoff–high 11 points, along with two assists, in a 111–88 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

The university announced on October 8, 2021 that Smith had qualified to play in the Aggies' upcoming tournament, the Phoenix Invitational hosted by nearby Elon University, on October 11 and 12. Under team rules, all golfers must qualify for regular–season tournaments in practice unless they were among the team's top two golfers in its previous tournament. Smith qualified for the Phoenix Invitational by one stroke, shooting rounds of 83 and 78 (respectively 12 and 7 over par) on the event's first day. Smith was named the North Carolina A&T Academic Athlete of the Year for 2021–2022 with a 4.0 GPA. Smith's time with the men's golf team is the focus of the 2023 docuseries Redefined: J. R. Smith.\n\nEsports[]\n\nIn 2021, Smith signed with Complexity Gaming and he also played Warzone tournaments.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 2012, The New York Times described Smith as perhaps the most heavily tattooed player in the NBA. He said that he got his first tattoo at 15 years old, has been in \"[p]robably a thousand\" tattoo parlors as of December 2012 and had lost count of his number of tattoos \"around 70–something.\" In June 2016, a Cleveland clothing company began selling a T-shirt which reproduced Smith's torso and upper arm tattoos.\n\nIn November 2016, Smith appeared on stage with his family at a Cleveland rally for the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign to endorse Clinton's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election.\n\nSmith modeled for Nike and Supreme in 2018. He subsequently had the Supreme logo tattooed on his calf.\n\nFamily[]\n\nSmith is the son of Ida and Earl Smith, and has three brothers and two sisters. His younger brother Chris briefly played alongside him on the Knicks in 2013–14. His younger brother Dimitrius played football at Monmouth University.\n\nIn August 2016, Smith married Jewel Harris; the couple have three daughters together. Smith has one daughter from a previous relationship. Their second daughter together was born in January 2017, weighing one pound at birth. Former Hornets and Knicks teammates Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony are the godfathers of his first two daughters.\n\nControversies[]\n\nOn June 9, 2007, Smith and two passengers were injured in a car accident on Stagecoach Road in Millstone Township, New Jersey, when the SUV that he was driving collided with another car. Smith and a passenger, Andre Bell, were ejected from the vehicle at around 5:30 p.m. Smith's vehicle went through a stop sign and collided with the other car. Smith was taken to Jersey Shore University Hospital. Bell suffered serious head injuries before being pronounced dead on the night of June 11. Neither Smith nor the second passenger suffered life–threatening injuries. Smith and Bell were not wearing seatbelts at the time. In October 2008, a grand jury in Monmouth County, New Jersey, declined to indict Smith on a vehicular manslaughter charge stemming from the accident.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Smith pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving in relation to the June 2007 accident. Smith was initially sentenced to 90 days in a Monmouth County (N.J.) jail, but 60 of those days were suspended, on the condition that he complete 500 hours of community service. On July 31, 2009, The Denver Post reported that Smith was released from jail after serving 24 days of his sentence.\n\nOn August 5, 2009, Smith closed his Twitter account because he was accused of writing in a way that reflected the Bloods gang, specifically replacing his c's with k's.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, Smith was suspended seven games for the 2009–10 NBA season in response to his guilty plea to a reckless driving charge related to the fatal 2007 accident. The NBA also cited his poor driving record as grounds for the suspension. Smith's driving record included five suspensions in eight months, but was \"in good standing\" at the time of the crash in New Jersey. He was required to pay restoration fees and fines. Smith totaled 27 points against his record from April 2005 to January 2006, including eight violations on seven different days. Five citations were for speeding. Since the accident, he has received two more speeding tickets and three license suspensions in New Jersey.\n\nIn March 2012, Smith was fined $25,000 by the NBA for posting a picture of model Tahiry Jose on his Twitter account. In May 2012, Smith was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida for failing to appear in court in 2011 after he was cited for operating a motor scooter with no valid license. The following month, he sued his former team, the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, for $1 million after the team withheld that amount from his salary claiming that he missed many practices and faked an injury.\n\nDuring the celebrations after the 2016 NBA Finals victory, Smith was spotted multiple times without a T–shirt. During President Barack Obama's congratulatory call to head coach Tyronn Lue, Obama made a reference to Smith's lack of shirt. As a result of his famous shirtlessness, Smith commissioned a t–shirt of his torso.\n\nIn September 2018, the NBA threatened to fine Smith if he appeared in a game without covering up the Supreme logo tattooed on his leg. Smith initially resisted, but after talking with National Basketball Players Association officials, eventually agreed to hide the tattoo.\n\nOn May 31, 2020, Smith was seen on video attacking another man. The man was allegedly participating in the George Floyd protests and had allegedly broken Smith's truck window with his skateboard. Smith claimed in a video to have chased the man down and \"whooped his ass\" because he \"broke his shit\", and he referred to the man as a \"motherf*cking white boy.\""
