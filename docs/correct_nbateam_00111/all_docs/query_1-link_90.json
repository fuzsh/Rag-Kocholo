        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – In some ways, J.R. Smith is this generation’s Bobby “Bingo” Smith to Cleveland Cavaliers fans.\n\nBingo Smith had a much longer career, 10 years with the Cavs beginning with the birth of the franchise in 1970.\n\nHis number No. 7 has been retired by the franchise, something that confuses many younger fans. He was never an All-Star. He never averaged more than 15.9 points per season. For the Cavs, he was a career 13.2 scorer.\n\nGood but not great.\n\nBut to fully appreciate Bingo Smith, well, you had to be there. . .\n\nFor the dismal days and smoky nights at the old Cleveland Arena in the early 1970s when the Cavs were deplorable. . .\n\nFor the Miracle of Richfield in 1975-76 season at the sparkling new Richfield Coliseum and the first playoff appearance in franchise history. . .\n\nFor the times where listening to the radio and hearing Joe Tait scream “BINGO!!!” when Smith drilled a 25-footer. This was before the NBA had a 3-point shot.\n\nBingo was a long-range shooter with few worries when it came to what was supposed to be a “good” or “bad” shot. He had he ball. He saw the rim. He fired away.\n\nThe same with J.R. Smith.\n\nThe Cavaliers waived J.R. Smith on Monday.\n\nNo tears.\n\nHis contract signed after the 2016 season was worth $45.6 million guaranteed — a little over $15 million annually for the 2-plus seasons where he played 132 games. It’s a complicated deal where he will continue to be paid $1.4 million annually the next three years.\n\nLOTS OF LOVE, LOTS OF LAUGHS\n\nEveryone who played a significant role on the 2016 Cavs title team will be warmly greeted and fondly remembered by Cleveland fans who experienced that glorious season.\n\nThey will remember J.R. Smith scoring eight quick points in the third quarter of Game 7 of the 2016 Finals in Oakland against Golden State. He also worked hard on defense in the 93-89 victory over the Warriors.\n\nThey will laugh about him forgetting the score at the end of Game 1 of the 2018 Finals. He dribbled out the clock with 4.5 seconds left, thinking the Cavs had a lead.\n\nThe score was tied. They lost in overtime.\n\nSmith was ridiculed, but to this day, I ask this question: “Where was the coaching staff? All those guys in suits? Why didn’t someone scream ‘TIME OUT!’”\n\nThe 2016 title team had LeBron James as the captain delivering one epic performance after another. They had Kyrie Irving at his best. They had Kevin Love sacrificing his scoring to concentrate on defense and rebounding.\n\nThey had Tristan Thompson’s fierce rebounding.\n\nThey also had J.R. Smith defending – something his critics said he’d never do.\n\nThey had J.R. Smith being a team player – also defying his critics.\n\nAnd they had J.R. Smith celebrating the title, as only J.R. Smith would.\n\nHe went around shirtless. He smoked cigars. He shook hands, told jokes, made everyone around him happy.\n\nThat’s why fans gave him a huge ovation at the Celebrity Softball Game during the recent All-Star celebration in Cleveland. He ripped off his shirt, ripped a triple and had a grand old time.\n\nLots of hugs, lots of laughs.\n\nAnd lots of memories.\n\nWHY HE MATTERED\n\nThe 1948 Indians...\n\nThe 1964 Browns...\n\nThe 2016 Cavaliers...\n\nThe last three Cleveland champions in the three major sports.\n\nFor fans who watched those teams, some players such J.R. Smith will always be treasured – not just the big-name stars.\n\nChanning Frye (another Cavs champion) received rousing ovations from the fans last season -- as he was approaching retirement. He rarely started in the championship season.\n\nMatthew Dellavedova remains with the team and is loved by fans, despite having a limited role in the 2016 playoffs.\n\nJ.R. Smith will be 34 before the start of the 2019-2020 season. He still wants to play somewhere.\n\nSmith has not been a very good player in the last few seasons.\n\nInjuries. Age. Fading talent. Bickering with management.\n\nThat’s part of his story, too.\n\nBut J.R. Smith came up huge on a big stage to make sports history in Cleveland.\n\nThat’s how I prefer to remember him."
