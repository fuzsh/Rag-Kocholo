        "text": "The NBA’s pre-bubble transaction window has triggered movement from all corners of the league. The Lakers and Cavaliers both made moves today, showing that roster movement during this period is not exclusive to the teams headed to Orlando.\n\nFollowing Avery Bradley’s decision to opt out of the NBA’s restart, the Lakers closed in on a deal with veteran guard J.R. Smith. ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski broke the news on Smith’s imminent signing on Monday.\n\nSmith, who was selected at No. 18 in the 2004 NBA Draft, last appeared on the court with the Cavaliers for 11 games in the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe Cavaliers, who are not heading to Orlando, reached an agreement with former Oregon Ducks big man Jordan Bell. The Athletic’s Shams Charania revealed that Bell agreed to a two-year deal with Cleveland. Along with the addition of Bell, the Cavs converted Dean Wade’s two-way contract to a multi-year deal. Wade started in 123 games over his four-year career at Kansas State.\n\nOutside of roster additions, forward Wilson Chandler informed the Nets that he will not be traveling with the team to Orlando for the restart. ESPN’s Malika Andrews delivered the news regarding Chandler’s decision on Sunday. Chandler, who signed with Brooklyn in the summer of 2019, appeared in just 35 games this season."
