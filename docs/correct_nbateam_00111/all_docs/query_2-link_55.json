        "text": "CLEVELAND — Since late November, and probably for a lot longer than that, this was how JR Smith’s tenure with the Cavaliers was going to end.\n\nGone before the final season on his contract was fully guaranteed for $15.6 million.\n\nHow it happened — the Cavs waived him by a 5 p.m. deadline Monday to avoid having to pay him an extra $760,000 for still being on the roster — is just the details.\n\nSure, you might say, the Cavs wasted a potential asset by failing to trade Smith (because of his contract, a team could have acquired him and waived him, saving at least $11 million against the salary cap), but the price to Cleveland for doing such a deal turned out not to be worth it. As it turned out, there weren’t enough teams desperate to clear cap space, and too many were demanding the Cavs take on a bad contract — which would have been too expensive — without offering a first-round pick.\n\nAs it is, the Cavs waived and “stretched” Smith, which means he’ll be paid about $1.4 million per season over the next three years, and are now a reported $2.8 million under the luxury tax.\n\nBut all of these financial and contract machinations … aren’t they kind of missing the point when it comes to Smith? What a life he led in Cleveland. Successful. Controversial. Colorful. Half naked. Disappointing. Appreciated.\n\nSmith is finally gone from the Cavs, but there is no way he could (or should) be forgotten. Here’s a look back at the moments you’ll all hold on to for Smith in Cleveland, for better or worse, long after the cap hit the Cavs took Monday is forgotten.\n\nThe beginning\n\nOn Jan. 5, 2015, then-general manager David Griffin pulled off a three-team trade in which Smith and Iman Shumpert came over from the Knicks, Dion Waiters was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Lou Amundson, Alex Kirk and a second-round pick were sent to New York. At the time, Shumpert was the centerpiece of the deal, but he was out with a shoulder injury. The Cavs had to take Smith to get Shumpert, and Griffin approached LeBron James about it to see whether he minded a player with a bad reputation joining the locker room. Smith had already racked up nearly $1 million in fines by the time he got to Cleveland. “OK, I’ve got him. I got him,” was LeBron’s response to Griffin. Smith started all but one of his 46 games for the Cavs and averaged 12.7 points. But there were some rocky moments — including when he hit Jae Crowder in the face during Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against Boston, drawing a two-game suspension. Smith was one of the Cavs’ few healthy remaining regulars by the time the NBA Finals arrived. He drew some wayward glances by riding a PhunkeeDuck scooter into the locker room before games.\n\nGame 7\n\nWhat more needs to be said? In the most important game of his life and in the 47-year history of the Cavs’ organization, Smith scored eight of his 12 points in the third quarter against the Warriors to thwart a Golden State run. You know what happened in the final frame — The Block, The Shot and The Stop (is that what we call it? Anyway …) — and suddenly Earl Smith III was an NBA champion. He didn’t wear a shirt for days after, including during the Cavs’ celebratory parade in downtown Cleveland. He actually made a T-shirt in the likeness of his naked, tattooed torso.\n\nThe holdout\n\nAfter the title season, Smith declined the player option on his contract, becoming an unrestricted free agent. There was virtually no market for him outside of Cleveland, which was already over the cap and couldn’t pay anybody else to replace Smith. So, while not technically a holdout because Smith was in fact not under contract, he missed all of training camp negotiating with the Cavs on a new deal, a time in which he postured with teammates by hanging out with them around Cleveland and working out privately in local gyms. Finally, on the last night of the preseason, Smith and the Cavs agreed to the four-year, $57 million deal that was terminated Monday. It was a terrible season for him personally. After some nagging leg issues early in the season, Smith sustained a broken thumb that required surgery and kept him out until March. Also, in January, his daughter Dakota was born prematurely at 22 weeks and remained in the hospital until May.\n\nNo soup for you\n\nYes, JR threw a bowl of soup at assistant coach Damon Jones. But BEFORE that, the 2017-18 campaign was trying for him. The Cavs signed LeBron’s best friend, Dwyane Wade, during training camp. Wade plays Smith’s position, and even though Smith was the starting shooting guard on three consecutive Finals teams, the future Hall of Famer Wade was not about to come off the bench. The demotion lasted only three games — Wade asked to go back to the bench — but it nevertheless crushed Smith for weeks. In early March 2018, Smith and Jones were jawing at each other in practice, and the discussion spilled into the lunchroom, where, yes, Smith lobbed a bowl of chicken tortilla soup at him. Cost Smith a game.\n\nOh, no\n\nSmith’s NBA epitaph, whenever the time comes to write it, should probably be led by what he did for the Cavs, and by proxy Northeast Ohio, in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals. But this one, Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, would be way up there. The score was tied at 107 when teammate George Hill missed a foul shot with 4.7 seconds left. Smith corralled the rebound, but rather than go back up for another shot, pass the ball out to LeBron or anybody else on the perimeter, or, hell, call timeout, Smith dribbled out the clock. He forgot the score. The Warriors won the game in overtime, LeBron punched a locker-room blackboard in anger and broke his hand (though he didn’t miss any games) and the Cavs were swept. Smith probably took too much blame. Hill could’ve made the free throw. LeBron or coach Tyronn Lue could’ve called timeout. But LeBron’s reaction to JR in the moment (I mean, you saw it, you know) was all it took.\n\nThe last straw\n\nBy the time training camp started in September 2018, the Cavs looked very different from the previous June. LeBron was gone, for starters. Smith, 33, was told entering camp not to expect much playing time as the team went young. And yet, two coaches, Lue and Larry Drew, continually played him. In the meantime, the Cavs were losing in a big way. Kevin Love was out with toe surgery, Lue was fired after an 0-6 start, and at one point general manager Koby Altman offered Smith the chance to get paid while sitting at home and waiting for a trade. Smith refused, but, on Nov. 20, he told The Athletic’s Jason Lloyd: “I don’t think the goal is to win. The goal isn’t to go out there and try to get as many wins as you can. I think the goal is to develop and lose to get lottery picks. I think that was always the plan.” If you want to argue the sequencing of the Cavs’ season, when they decided to rebuild and how injuries played a role, fine. Most of what Smith said in that moment was true. And, of course, those are things no player can say publicly about his team. The Cavs and Smith agreed to part ways the next day, with Smith remaining on the roster until Altman could find a trade that never came.\n\nHistory’s verdict\n\nDid Smith underperform his contract? Yes. He never averaged more than 8.6 points in his last three seasons. But did he earn that payday with his work in 2016? (Let us not forget, he averaged 12.4 points and shot 40 percent from 3-point range for the season.) Well, in his final public appearance in Cleveland as a Cavalier — last week at the MLB All-Star Game’s celebrity softball game, Smith was greeted by a standing ovation as he strode to the plate. He tore off his jersey. Made it all the way around the bases on an inside-the-park homer (with errors), and did a rusty, hadn’t-been-used-in-a-while rendition of his 3-point celebration. The crowd went berserk.\n\n(Top photo: Gregory Shamus / Getty Images)"
