Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick admitted he'd prefer Paul Pogba did his rehabilitation with the club, but said the decision for the midfielder to rehab in Dubai was made before he arrived at Old Trafford. There are issues as their performance are nowhere near good enough, Neville told Sky Sports. Aston Villa, Everton, Villarreal and Leicester are half decent teams. I think for Christian, the door is always open. Follow Tottenham Hotspur with Sky SportsFollow every Tottenham game in the Premier League this season with our live blogs on the Sky Sports website and app, and watch match highlights for free shortly after full-time. Over 14 years on, Peter Bosz's current team boasts its share of talent and even though the result would not have any bearing on both sides' positions the group, the game provided the toughest assignment of Van Bronckhorst's nascent tenure. It is generally the quickest and most convenient option and gives players and staff maximum time to prepare for games. Lacazette summed up Arsenal's character' Lacazette endured a frustrating evening and is still without a league goal from open play since December 11 but he kept going until the last, eventually helping Arsenal over the line. âWeâre buzzing to take on three of the worldâs best sides at home. Canada are reigning Olympic champions, Spain have some outstanding players in their squad, and obviously it doesnât get much bigger an occasion than England v Germany. Forest are ambitious themselves this window as they look to push for promotion to the top flight this season. Arsenal have not only a rich history on the men's side but also an enormous history on the women's side, she says. Arsenal vs Watford on Sky: Tierney in contentionArteta: Smith Rowe should be happy England omission is questionedI think [the top sides] are in a much stronger position than we are right now, as they've had a chance, especially over the last several years, to really build their squads to a different place. As for Newcastle, this was an early stern test for Howe and once Arsenal got their noses in front, the result was never likely to go in their favour. Norwich and Burnley follow next and six points - or at least four - are needed to bolster their chances of surviving in the top-flight. The player with the most completed passes to Aubameyang at Leeds was goalkeeper Bernd Leno with five.

NationalÂ ... And so, for all of Chelseaâs fight, they are out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage, while they are comfortably third best in the Premier League as well. They deserve to be commended for almost completing an unlikely comeback in Madrid, but ultimately they fell short, with the three goals conceded at Stamford Bridge last week proving crucial â so too some big missed chances late on in the second leg. Ross Stewart claimed his first Sunderland hat-trick as the Owls were comprehensively beaten, with Callum Doyle and Benji Kimpioka also scoring. Indeed, the French side have lost each of their last three games when hosting English opponents (v Manchester United in 2019 and 2020, v Manchester City in 2021).Paris Saint-Germain were held by Club Brugge on MD1, extending their winless run in the UEFA Champions League to four games (D1 L3). Jorginho's error robbed them of a clean sheet against Manchester United but it was only the fifth goal conceded this season. UEFA put the matter to their disciplinary team, and they awarded the win to the French side, which led to Spurs being knocked out of the competition. They were founded in 2015 by Bobby Kasanga who realised there was no semi-professional team in the borough of Hackney. He wanted to give local players the opportunity to play semi-pro. The 22-year-old was outstanding in this match, scoring a beautiful 25-yard effort to open the scoring, with the ball finding the bottom corner as well as providing a delightful assist for Milan Skriniar's headed goal. I believe in continuity, I believe you build by creating a great organisation with stability and the minute you turn people over and it's musical chairs, it's not a good thing. We interrupt your coverage of the here and now to bring you a delightful slice of how things were. Not a day goes by we don't miss Dimitar Berbatov, and all those Dimitar Berbatov things he used to do. Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford both came on as United look to see out their victory. This was not the first time. Morocco went ahead thanks to Hakimiâs free-kick which went through the top corner and gave Thomu no chance. It was the Paris Saint-Germain full-backâs second straight free-kick conversion in this tournament after another well-taken strike in their last match against Gabon. The only Premier League Saturday fixture to survive the Covid outbreak was one-way traffic in the first half and Arsenal could have had double their three-goal lead at the break. Rodri rose highest to head Riyad Mahrez's free-kick goalwards but his powerful header was cleared off the line by Presnel Kimpembe. The 34-year-old, who has been a free agent since leaving Al-Hilal in August, added on the likelihood of a deal being concluded: Here [in Toronto] they are really sure that it is done. They are waiting for him in March. They probably wanted to direct Vlahovic towards the English offers. Meanwhile, Sky Sports News reported in August Tottenham were interested in signing Vlahovic. So, it may well be strange Antonio, but ultimately Arsenal probably did your tenure a favour - losing to a bunch of kids would do nothing for those elite credentials. Should the Villans win, they will be the first team to complete a league double over Manchester United with a different manager in charge for each game since Bolton Wanderers in 1950-51 (Walter Rowley and Bill Ridding).As a player, Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard ended on the winning side in 10 Premier League games against Man Utd, a joint-record along with Nicolas Anelka, John Terry and Petr Cech. Now they have to create opportunities for him. That is potentially where Lampard's signings, Dele Alli and Donny van de Beek come in, but they are also goalscorers themselves. The government do expect us to carry out more random checking than what we've previously done so there is every chance it will take longer to get in. Within a decade of that interview, he had won the Ballon d'Or, been named Fifa's World Player of the Year and scored for Barcelona what many consider to be the greatest hat-trick of all-time. Allan Saint-Maximin provided a key threat going forward for the Magpies and after beating two defenders, he unleashed a low strike from the edge of the area which Schmeichel did well to keep out. Chris Wilder's side are now winless in five matches after Riley McGree's goal was quickly cancelled out by Swans striker Michael Obafemi in a breathless opening to the second half at the Swansea.com Stadium. When you're struggling like Liverpool are, you play your best team. Divock Origi isn't going to win Liverpool leagues, no disrespect. Paul Pogba is not expected to return to action for Manchester United until February, with the midfielder set to be sidelined for another four or five weeks. Perhaps Chelsea legs were tired - a legitimate grievance given they played away at Manchester United three days ago - but the performance was reserved, almost standoffish. Man of the match - Chris Willock It's two goals in two games for the 23-year-old, who is a key component of Mark Warburton's front line. âWe did some extra tests at 12 oâclock today to make sure who would arrive at lunch. From there we had to pick the team. Would it be the same line-up? I donât know. The situation started yesterday with the players feeling unwell and not training. By 2002, he had lifted the World Cup as an integral part of Brazil's fearsome frontline - Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo. A year later he added a Champions League title with AC Milan. It's a damning result and they had chances to make it worse, Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo told Movistar. Sometimes things like this do happen but we've got no intention of letting that happen at this present time here at West Ham. West Ham are seventh in the Premier League as they target an improvement on last season's sixth-placed finish and possible qualification for next season's Champions League.
