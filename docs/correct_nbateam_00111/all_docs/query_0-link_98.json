Smith over his behavior on the bench that rubbed management the wrong way.\n\nSmith will be allowed to play against Charlotte on Monday night, although Rex Chapman, vice president of player personnel, didn’t rule out some sort of punishment for the guard.\n\nSmith, who has been mired in a prolonged shooting slump, sulked on the bench Saturday night, when he played a season-low 12 minutes and scored just three points in a win over New Orleans.\n\nNuggets coach George Karl said Smith will come off the bench, as usual, against the Bobcats."
