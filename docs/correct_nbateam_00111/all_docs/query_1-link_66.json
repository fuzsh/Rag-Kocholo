        "text": "Love him or hate him, one thing is for sure about LeBron James: He has an iron-clad commitment to his craft and his body.\n\nHe reportedly spends more than $1 million a year to keep his body right, so it’s no wonder he was able to post some amazing individual numbers this season (30.3 points, 8.2 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game) at age 37.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers superstar has also been working on his game.\n\nDays ago, he was in a New York City gym getting up shots with Kevin Love, his former teammate on the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2015 to 2018.\n\nMore recently, James was spotted working out with J.R. Smith, another former teammate.\n\nSmith played with James on the Cavs from midway through the 2014-15 season through the 2017-18 campaign. The 6-foot-6 wing was a key part of the historic 2016 Cavs team that won the NBA title.\n\nSmith then joined the Lakers for the 2020 NBA playoffs, allowing the two to win a second world championship together.\n\nBecause it’s James, and because of the disproportionate power he supposedly has over the Lakers organization, this may inevitably make fans wonder whether he is angling to bring Smith back to the Purple and Gold next season.\n\nList\n\nLakers sign Scotty Pippen Jr. of Vanderbilt to two-way contract"
