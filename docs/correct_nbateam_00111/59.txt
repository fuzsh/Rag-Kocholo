J.R. Smith is an innocent bystander (for once, hey-o!) in all this drama regarding Melo (or...Melodrama, get it?). He’s just trying to go out there and play his best. His play this year has been a big reason the Nuggets, despite all the distractions, are sixth in the West, and feature the best offense in the land. But in an interview with the Denver Post, Smith talked a little bit about the situation in Denver, and his quote was at least a bit revealing.

Now, obviously, J.R. Smith is not going to be in on the talks with the front office regarding whether and where to trade Carmelo Anthony. He’s not “in the loop” on things. But Smith is a Denver player confirming what the situation has looked like for a while... the Nuggets don’t really know what they want to do with Anthony. They don’t have a plan. They kept pushing for more and more assets in the Nets deal, and tore it apart. They have constantly balked at the Knicks, while the Knicks have remained calm, cool, and collected, never losing sight of the fact Melo can sign with them in free agency.
