        "text": "Is your name TREE\n\nlast year my uncle met a couple called TREE on a coach holiday to Wales I think. I would love to meet them,as they knew my mother Doreen Price and her brother as children. They live on an East Hull housing Estate.Unfortunately they are not in the phone book. Do you know them? Larkin\n\nWilliam Alfred (born 1823 in Wapping) and Susannah Larkin (nee Ansell) and their children moved to Kingston Upon Hull some time around 1870 from Greenwich. He was a sawyer. His sons Alfred and George became fishermen/seamen. Alfred was lost at sea in 1888. I think George married Susannah Tucker. Another son, William Robert Alfred, also a sawyer moved to Hull with his wife Emily and family but went back to London, (Lee) in 1880. William senior and Susannah also had daughters, Louisa Ann born 1854; Susannah Louisa who married Edward Howbrigg in 1886; Ann Elizabeth born 1856. Can anyone flesh out more information about the Larkins in Hull? Bolderson / Balderson\n\nJohn Bolderson (or Balderson) was born circa 1847/8 in Hull. His father was George, a farmer or farm labourer. But I can find no trace of them in the census or BMD. Can anyone give me any information please? John married Sophia Harvey nee Lain in Hull on 24 September 1872; and John was soon widowed. He remarried - Margaret Lauchlan nee Hackett. Dunn, Henry William\n\nHenry William Dunn was convicted of theft in London, 1827. He appeared to have at least two sisters in Hull. He was transported to NSW and has many descendants in Australia. Does anyone have any idea of his antecedents in Hull? He was very naughty and didn't put any details on the usual certificates in Australia, ie marriage, death or childrens birth certificates. Will share his family tree in Australia. Best regards Rosie thomas rowntree thompson joiner\n\nI cannot find Thomas Rowntree Thompson anywhere on census, births, marriage, deaths etc. His son Thomas Thompson _ also cannot find on Births -(occ fisherman) was born in 1868ish and married one Annie Elizabeth Betts in Hull in 1899. Thos was 31 and Annie 21 - address 37 Havelock st at the time. On the marr cert it gives his father's name as Thomas Rowntree Thompson (deceased) occ joiner. etc. Thos and Annie had 3 children, Ethel May 1902, Stan Moran 1905, and Hector 1909. At some point they ended up living in Grimsby, they were there by 1929. Thomas was lost at sea acc to family stories but I have no proof of that either. Anyone know of Thos Rowntree Thompson? Bentley family of Hull\n\nLooking for descendants of Sam Bentley (1874-1953) who married Fanny Begal (1875-1929). Believe that one son, Israel, married Maria Marton in the 1930s. Other sons were Wolff (b.1904) and Morris (b. 1905); daughter was possibly Rachel, who married Israel Gilbert (Golberg) in 1930. Also descedants of Abraham Bentley who married Jenny Baron. Daughter Olga (b. 1926) might have married Maurice Dennison in 1947; daughter Audrey might have married John H. Franklin in 1950. There might have been other daughters, Lylla and Yetta. There was another person called Abraham Bentley who had a daughter, Ruth, in Hull at that time. These are possibly all descendants or related to Isaac and Fanny Bentley, who came to England from Poland in the 1890s. They are my great grandparents, and I am trying to trace these relatives for the family history.

Edward (edwin )Lee\n\nI am trying to trace any descendants of the Lee family who possibly originated from Mirfield then moved to Hull presumably for work opportunities on the trawlers etc.My great grandfather was Edward aka Edwin Lee born around 1859 ,his father was Matthew Lee who may have married a Sarah Blissitt but not sure.Edward married Georgianna/georgina from Suffolk.One of their children was my grandfather John Lee who was born in 1910 and died at sea in 1935 when my mother was only 9 months old.I think one of Edwards children -Emma -married into the Foster family from around the sculcoates/Myton area of Hull.If anyone has any of these people in their family could they please let me know through this site.

They lived in Hull the rest of their lives having a plethora of boys and girls! William Henry,Thomas Wm., Frederick G., Robert, Walter G., and Sarah Ann, & Edith. The sons became self employed joiners & decorators in Hull. I have tracked William Henry who went on to have by 1901 (with wife Isabel Gertrude?) Thomas Cedric, Alice Ellaline, William Ernest & Doris Lillian. My father, age 90 and myself(childless) are the last survivors of that original Liverpool connection. Any contacts? Searby\n\nMy great (great) grandfather was John Quarton Searby, a boatman later a Customs Officer at Kingston-upon-Hull (where this family originated and was centred). With his first wife Ann Pick he had two children William Sothern Searby who became a shopkeeper (Ham and bacon) in Bridlington and married Janey/Jennie/Jeannie Mewse. They had one child Rose Ethel who married George A Bullock in Hartlepool and possibly another daughter who died aged 5. I am not sure if my paternal grandfather Joseph Harold Searby (later a shopkeeper in Anlaby Road, Hull) was the son of John Quarton or of William Sothern. Janey/Jennie died in 1893 and William remarried, probably Clara Simpson and had further children. One of them, Marjorie, married Stanley Herman Pickering in 1926. Arthur Frederick married Ellen Pratt at Grimsby, became a Hosier's Manager at Bridlington and had one son. With his second wife Mary Temperton, John Quarton Searby had 6 further children. Florence Mary Searby married Charles Fearn Craven and possibly had a son - Arthur or George. Walter Searby married Ella Eliza French and probably had a son Walter who died aged 3. Harry Searby (Grocer in Hull) married Annie Wilson. Annie Searby married William Salton. Alice Searby married Arthur Fish and had children Arthur and Norah. Hilda Searby married Cyril B Mowforth and had daughter Enid M Mowforth (born York). Any information would be appreciated as I have failed to make any connections with members of the Searby family.

John was a merchant seaman recorded on marriage to Emma Donna Esther Lyth in 1886, Kingston Upon Hull, East Yorkshire. His name was registered on marr. cert. as MacWhiteman, but may have been known as ÂMacÂ by his shipmates. He worked for the Thomas Wilson shipping line (later Ellerman Wilson line) out of Hull, and was drowned on 18.9.1888 at Elsinore, Denmark when a ship-to-shore boat from the ÂS.S.

The surnames are shown below, one (Corbett) having come from Birmingham but several from Cheshire and Lincolnshire, though all names have a beginning or move into East Yorkshire, including Hull. Beck, Beharell, Corbett, Grainger, Hammond, Holdsworth, Huntsman, Jones, Kingston, May, Ogdon, Roberts, Staveley, Storey and Waudby. Horton\n\nI am looking for ancestors of John and Rebecca (Milner) Horton both born in 1811? He in Hull and she in Bridlington. He is believed to have been a tailor by trade. They apparently had 4 children before coming to the United Sates in 1850. Their names are Charles, Sara, David and Thomas. They moved to Eden Prairie Minnesota in 1850"
