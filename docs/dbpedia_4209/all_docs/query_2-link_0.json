        "text": "(This page also refers to Phillip Goodhand-Tait's previous band, Circus. For the hip hop artist of the same name, see Circus(2)).\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait (born 3 January 1945, Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer and keyboard player.\n\nGoodhand-Tait was known as Phil Tait in his school years. His mother was a piano teacher and his father was involved in trade unions. Goodhand-Tait began his music career shortly after the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, in 1957. His first group, Phill Tone and the Vibrants, was renamed Phill and the Stormsville Shakers in 1961. The band included Paul Demers on drums, Ivor Shackleton on guitar, and Kirk Riddle on bass. By 1966, the same year the group released its first singles, the Stormsville Shakers's lineup included Tait, Riddle, Ian Jelfs on guitar, David Sherrington on tenor sax, and Alan Bunn on drums.\n\nThat same year Mel Collins was recruited on second tenor sax. In 1967, the band's name changed to Circus, releasing further singles sides. January 1969 saw Goodhand-Tait exit the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Jelfs, Collins, Riddle, and new drummer Chris Burrows to write, record and release the self-titled pop-jazz album Circus, after which they disbanded in 1970.\n\n(read more on Wikipedia)\n\n[]\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait was, like Jess Roden, an artist who never achieved major commercial success but became a lasting Peel favourite.\n\nWIth his band the Stormsville Shakers, Goodhand-Tait began to make his name in 1966, when their early singles were released and were played by Radio London and other pirate radio stations. At that time, Peel was working in America for the San Bernardino radio station KMEN and 'I'm Gonna Put Some Hurt On You' by Phillip Goodhand-Tait And The Stormsville Shakers was included in the DJ's KMEN British Pop Top Ten chart for two weeks in June 1966,\n\nBy the time Peel returned to Britain in 1967 the music scene was changing, and some groups and artists changed their style as a result - like the Alan Bown Set and Phillip Goodhand-Tait. According to Ken Garner's The Peel Sessions book, the BBC audition panel described Phillip's new band, Circus, as 'outdated, square, rubbish, badly played, out of tune, ... NO'. Unsurprisingly they failed in their BBC audition, but nonetheless, they managed to do a session for Peel's programme in 1968. He also saw them perform in London twice in 1969.\n\nPeel remained a fan of the musician and named his track, 'No Problem', as one of his favourite songs in the Peel's 77 All Time Favourite Records List, published in Disc & Music Echo on 15th January 1972. He also mentioned in the list that Phillip Goodhand-Tait & The Stormsville Shakers was his favourite group name after Stark Naked And The Car Thieves.\n\nIn 1973, Peel had the singer perform at his roadshow in Chelsea Village, Bournemouth. [1] [2]\n\nA year later, Peel reviewed Phillip's single, 'Almost Killed A Man', in Singles Reviews, published on 9th March 1974 in Sounds, where he called it \"a really excellent record\" and stated that the singer deserved to be better known. Comparing him with fellow DJM label artist Elton John, JP remarked that \"Philip has none of Elton's brashness and hustle about him, but as a writer, he's not far behind\".\n\nThe musician also did two solo sessions for Peel's show and the DJ would often revisit Phillip's songs in later decades on his radio programmes, including tracks by both of his previous bands, the Stormsville Shakers and Circus.\n\nSessions[]\n\nCircus\n\n1.
