        "text": "Annie Croft was born in the village of Skirlaugh in 1892 and started as a ‘baby’ performer at the tender age of 5.\n\nYounger than Mira by 9 years, she entered theatre when Variety and Vaudeville were the main forms of entertainment and gained fame on the London, European and Australian stage.\n\nAged 15 in 1907, she taught up and coming talent at her school the Waverlee Academy of Music, at the same time carrying on as a dancer and singer using her soprano voice to sing the soaring notes of popular songs.\n\nBy 1914 she had become a fine comedy actress and spoke the written word as an elocutionist which pleased her audiences, making her very famous in her home town of Hull.\n\nLike many in the city her thoughts also turned to those less fortunate and in a caring city she did what she could. Ms Croft and her pupils gave concerts for charity at a time when people were expected to look after themselves.\n\nOn November 24th 1910 Waverlee Academy raised money for the Deaf Children’s Schools Fund and on April 21st to 23rd she was seen at the Lecture Hall in Kingston Square for the Mother Humber Fund. Right up until she left for America her charitable giving carried on.\n\nShortly afterwards Annie appeared as ‘Yum Yum’ in the Hull Amateurs’ performance of The Mikado. One of the most important operatic roles it was held the Grand Theatre in December 1910 and afterwards she continued acting with them for another four years.\n\nBy April 1912 when appearing in Doncaster, she was reported as being approached by a talent-spotting Agent keen to spur on her success but it took another couple of years for it to come to fruition and she returned to Hull with her dreams unrealised, staying local to Hull.\n\nDoing everything herself from stage management to performing, she penned the musical ‘Lu Lu Girl’ appearing at the Lecture Hall theatre from January 27th 1913.\n\nLater that year, in November, she appeared as ‘Mad Margaret’ in the Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘Ruddigore’ again at the Grand, but soon international success was beckoning. Ms Croft was popular at a time when Hollywood movies were silent and stage shows were the audience’s television across the land.\n\nMr Robert Courtnedge, a musical comedy producer, spotted Ms Croft and in April 1914 she left her pupils and cancelled all outstanding engagements in Hull. Her last performances were in the musical comedy ‘The Pearl Girl,’ also playing Juliet in the Hull Shakespeare and Playgoer’s Society at the Alexandra just before she left.\n\nMoving to London, from there her star was in the ascendant and after a successful stage career she left with husband Reginald Sharland to go to America before giving birth to sons Peter and David Croft.\n\nAppearing in one film, ‘On With The Dance’ in 1927, she toured Australia in 1928 with Reginald both playing in ‘The Girlfriend,’ but it was her sons who broke into national consciousness, particularly second son David who inherited her comedic talent and the glitter of good luck.\n\nIn the Seventies and Eighties he penned classics like Dad’s Army, Hi-De-Hi and ‘Allo ‘Allo, comedy staples on British television."
