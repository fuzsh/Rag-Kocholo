        "text": "About this Playlist\n\nIn the expansive retro rendition of Hoof’s ‘Human Rhythms Not Algorithms‘ playlist, a sweeping array of music spanning the 1960s to the early 2020s. Comprising hits from that era, obscure yet captivating album tracks, and tunes once lost but resurrected through extensive digital excavations and traditional research methods.\n\nThe ‘where to start with’ playlists serve as more than just a mere musical compass; they are an enjoyable creation but an even greater delight to experience.\n\nSo, where does one embark on this musical journey? One might begin with the band that arguably laid the groundwork for contemporary pop music. Delve into the discographies of John, Paul, Ringo, and George, then transition to the enduring competition between the Fab Four and their counterparts, still reigning on the global charts today. From Mick Jagger, Ronnie Wood, and the entire Stones ensemble to The Who—who pioneered progressive rock—to the individual endeavors of Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey. Move on to the legendary songwriting partnership of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, creators of some of the most cherished and iconic songs of all time. Explore the repertoire of one of the best-selling bands in history, along with a selection from Stevie Nicks’ fellow bandmates.Following this, a cherished favorite of Hoof’s emerges—the Empress of Soul, Gladys Knight. Then, of course, there’s Bowie; need I elaborate further? Similarly, The Purple One and The Modfather each bring forth an extensive catalogue. The list grows exponentially, with nearly 250 songs from Weller, spanning The Style Council to The Jam. Subsequently, a series of playlists surfaces from some of Hoof’s most cherished bands, with the promise of continual expansion on a monthly basis. Expect curated selections from the likes of the Beta Band, Beck, Eels, Radiohead, Bahama Soul Club and Ashley Beedle.\n\nThe latest inclusion is inspired the mixes of Paul Hillery, a serious record digger, who discovers albums in dusty record bins and finds some quality Folk Funk and Country Soul songs. Inspiration also comes from the many compilations and playlists over the last few years from the likes of DJ Supermarket sharing the sounds of AoR and Yacht Rock."
