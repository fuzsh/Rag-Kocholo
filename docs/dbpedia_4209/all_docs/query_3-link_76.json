        "text": "Hull will be the UK's City of Culture from 2017, meaning three years of events from the city's arts scene and a boom in investment and funding.\n\nWhile many may be quick to snub the east Yorkshire city, which has some of the highest levels of unemployment in the country and has been a regular mention in the annual Crap Towns list, Hull actually has a rich history of inspiring creatives. Here are some of them.\n\nSir Tom Courtenay\n\nHull born and bred, Courtenay attended the city's Kingston High School with TV actor John Alderton before heading to RADA and a starry career in film. However, Courtenay's greatest service to Hull is possibly convincing Hollywood actor Omar Sharif to support its football club while both men were on the set of Dr Zhivago in the Sixties. They later shared a flat together. Upon receiving an honorary degree from Hull University in 2010, Sharif explained that Courtenay \"kept telling me about Hull City Football Club\" and he \"began to idolise the team\".\n\nNEWS: Hull named UK City of Culture 2017\n\nMaureen Lipman\n\nMaureen Lipman returns to her school in Hull (BBC)\n\nLipman is another actor who was born in Hull and grew up in a \"small, three-bedroomed terraced house in Northfield Road. It was in the part of the Anlaby Road that lay somewhere between commercial and suburban living.\" Lipman's father was a tailor who kept a shop in the city centre. In 2012, the comedienne returned to Newland School for Girls, where she was reportedly \"funny and got away with murder\", to film a documentary.\n\nNorman Collier\n\nThe comedian perfected his chicken impersonation and broken microphone routines in the clubs of Hull and the surrounding area. Collier was born in Hull and was encouraged to leave his job in the city's BP chemical factory by his colleagues, whom he would amuse with improvised routines during tea breaks. He finally became a full-time comic in 1962 and never left his hometown for the bright lights of London, instead living and raising his three children in a nearby village.\n\nStevie Smith and The Watersons\n\nAlthough Smith moved to London when she was three, the poet and novelist was born in Hull, a house she described as \"such a happy house, I'll never forget 34 Delapole Avenue\". The very same address was later inhabited by folk singer and guitarist Martin Carthy and his wife Norma Waterson, whose family had a folk club and pub in Hull. Waterson, along with her sister Lal, brother Mike and cousin John Harrison formed The Watersons, a key band in Hull's undergound but vibrant Sixties folk scene.\n\nMick Ronson\n\nBest known as David Bowie's guitarist and musical collaborator, Mick Ronson was born in Hull and played his first ever gig in Brough, a village 11 miles away, aged 17. Ronson formed his inimitable style playing in two local bands: first The Mariners, then The Crestas. He secured a solid reputation for the latter, playing four gigs a week with the band in venues in Hull and nearby Beverley and North Ferriby in the early Sixties. Ronson's final solo album, released in 1994, a year after his death, paid tribute to his hometown. Titled Heaven and Hull, the Humber Bridge is pictured in the album sleeve.\n\nAnthony Minghella\n\nThe Oscar-winning director of The English Patient spent a decade at Hull University becoming a first-class drama student and lecturer. Although he moved to London in the early Eighties to pursue a television career, Hull was where he admitted he honed his skills as a director and writer by ventures such as writing and staging his own philosophical musical in his final year. In 2008, the university built The Anthony Minghella Studio, which was opened by Alan Plater, another Hull-based playwright.\n\nThe Housemartins\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"fourth best band in Hull\" formed in the early Eighties and became a vessel for musical names including Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, Stan Cullimore, Paul Heaton, who formed The Beautiful South with fellow member Dave Hemingway and comedian Phil Jupitus, who toured with the band in 1986 as \"Porky the Poet\". The Housemartins achieved chart success over the course of the decade with their album London 0 Hull 4, and stayed loyal to the city. Even after being tipped by John Peel the band continued to perform in venues in Hull, such as The Tower nightclub, for documentaries and radio sessions.\n\nRoger McGough and Philip Larkin\n\nBefore the author and playwright went on to form the Liverpool Poets in the 1960s, McGough studied French and Geography at Hull University. McGough and Larkin met Needler Hall, where McGough was a librarian and Larkin a sub-warden until he found accommodation and went on to become the university's main librarian. Later McGough plucked up the courage to write to the older Larkin, a published poet, about his own poetry, sending him his work as he was too nervous to discuss it with him in person.\n\nAs for Larkin, known as the Hermit of Hull, the city formed the setting for much of his work. The poet held his post at the library for 30 years until his death in 1985, renting a flat overlooking the city's Pearson Park for two decades. He would write in his office in the library, impressing his colleagues with what appeared to be long hours of professional dedication. Larkin said of the city, \"I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that\".\n\nAndrew Motion\n\nAndrew Marvell\n\nContinuing the poetry theme, it would be wrong not to include one of Hull's earliest. Marvel was born near Hull in 1621 and was educated in the city's grammar school, now named after him. He later became MP for the city.\n\nJohn Alderton\n\nAlderton grew up in Hull, the son of a man who was born and bred in the city. He went on to become a regular TV and stage actor in shows such as Upstairs, Downstairs. He returned to his more familiar Yorkshire to play vet James Herriot in the 1975 film, It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet.\n\nWreckless Erik\n\nThe new wave singer, best known for releasing (I'd Go The) Whole Wide World in 1977, attended at the Hull College of Art. He was one of the original members signed to Stiff Records, the label which also took on Ian Dury, Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe.\n\nTracey Thorn and Ben Watt\n\nThe founders of pop group Everything But the Girl were both studying at the University of Hull when they were signed as solo artists to the Cherry Red Records label. In the same year that Thorn graduated with a first in English Literature, the pair released their debut album together, Eden. Thorn's autobiography, Bedsit Disco Queen: How I Grew Up and Tried to Be a Pop Star, opens on the pair's first day at university, when Watt made a tannoy announcement: \"If Tracey of the Marine Girls is in the building, will she please come to reception\". The band's name is even inspired by the slogan of a Hull shop, Turner's Furniture.\n\nGenesis P-Orridge\n\nP-Orridge, born Neil Andrew Megson, is thought by some to have been the original godfather of punk. His first gigs with performance art collective COUM happened in various pubs around Hull, and Megson moved to the city in 1969. It was to become the place where he would rename himself as P-Orridge and court the attentions of the national media after being picked up by the Yorkshire Post and the University of Hull's student paper. Local radio broadcasts and riots at the city's Gondola Club followed, resulting in its closure, but COUM gained funding from the Yorkshire Arts Association shortly after. Before P-Orrige relocated to London in 1973, he ruffled Hull's feathers once more with his conceptual artwork Wagon Train at the Ferens Art Gallery.\n\nHave we missed out a Hull cultural icon you think should be included?
