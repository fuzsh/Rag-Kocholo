We are now poised to transform the clinical management of cancer in all people with a family history. I am Chief Investigator of the CaPP3 trial, a dose non-inferiority study to determine the optimal dose of aspirin for cancer chemoprevention in Lynch Syndrome, will reach last Patient Last Visit in June 2024. 1879 carriers of Lynch Syndrome have been randomised in the UK, Finland, Spain, Israel and Australia. CAPP2 also demonstrated a major reduction of non-colorectal cancers in those randomised to resistant starch (high fibre) supplements.\n\nOur Cancer Prevention Group has developed a patented multiplex PCR assay, the Newcastle MSI-Plus Assay, which is being deployed to screen colorectal and other tumours for evidence of sporadic or germline MisMatch Repair deficiency, the underlying molecular basis of Lynch syndrome and a target for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors. We have shown the assay to be able to detect Microsatellite Instability in cell free DNA from urine of people with Lynch syndrome who have a urinary tract cancer."
