        "text": "Biography of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull (c.1665-1726)\n\nEvelyn was the third son of Robert Pierrepont of Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, and his wife Elizabeth Evelyn. He was born at West Dean, Wiltshire (an estate brought to the Pierrepont family by the marriage of Robert Pierrepont with Elizabeth Evelyn), was educated at Winchester School, and entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1683.\n\nHe served as M.P. for East Retford from 1689-90, until he succeeded his brother as 5th Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull. In the first decade of the eighteenth century he was known as a sociable and popular man, and a member of the Kit-Kat Club.\n\nHe was Commissioner for the Union with Scotland in 1706, and in the same year was created Marquess of Dorchester. Among the local offices which he held were those of Custos Rotulorum of Nottinghamshire, c.1696-c.1701, and of Wiltshire, 1706-12 and 1714-26, Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire c.1701-14, and Lord Lieutenant 1714-26, Recorder of Nottingham 1707-26, and Chief Justice in Eyre North of the Trent, 1714-16. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1708. In August 1715, he was created Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull.\n\nHis loyal support of the Whig government ensured more appointments after receiving the dukedom. He was Lord Privy Seal from 1716 to 1718 and again from 1720 to 1726. In between, he acted as Lord President of the Council. The Duke became a Knight of the Garter in 1719, and acted as Lord Justice (Regent) during the King's absence. He died at Holme Pierrepont in March 1725/6.\n\nA portrait of the Duke, by G.
