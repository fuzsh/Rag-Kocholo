        "text": "Welcome to the Yorkshire BMD web site, part of the Local BMD Project group of Family History and Genealogy web sites.\n\nThe Register Offices in the county of Yorkshire, England, hold the original records of births, marriages and deaths back to the start of civil registration in 1837.\n\nThe county's Family History Societies are collaborating with the local Registration Services to make the indexes to these records freely searchable via the Internet.\n\nAlthough the indexes are not yet complete for all years and districts, we hope that the database will eventually cover all Yorkshire births, marriages and deaths from 1837.\n\nThe menus at the top give access to all the sections of this web site. To visit all the other web sites which are placing original registrars' indexes on-line click on the UKBMD logo below. UKBMD also has a Multi-Region Search feature which can be used to search several BMD sites in one go if you are not sure of the area that your ancestors were from.\n\nIf you have any comments or queries regarding this web-site, or wish to contact us, please visit our Frequently Asked Questions page.\n\nSoftware update: The Advanced Search feature has been updated to include a Gaelic Prefix option with the aim of taking into account names that have been anglicised and possibly lost their O' or Mc', etc., prefixes over time, or indexed without an apostrophe, e.g. as ONEIL rather than O'NEIL. See the Hints and Tips page for details.\n\nFree Online Tutorials on how to get the best from these Local BMD websites can be found on the UKBMD website's Tutorials page.\n\nYorkshire BMD has been in continuous operation since 2 April 2002"
