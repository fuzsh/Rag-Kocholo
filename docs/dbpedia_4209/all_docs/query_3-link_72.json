        "text": "This topic area covers statistics and information relating to Hull’s resident population including the age and gender structure of the local population, numbers registered with local GPs including local strategic need and service provision. Further information relating to population including Race and Ethnicity and Population Projections are given within Population, and information relating to Housing and Households including household composition is given within Tools and Resources.\n\nHeadlines\n\nPeople have different health and wellbeing needs at different ages and stages of their lives so it is important to understand the structure of the local population, not just in terms of their gender and current ages, but in terms of future projections of population numbers as well as other factors which influence health need such as deprivation, housing, employment, etc as well as where different groups of people live in the city. This is necessary in order to plan services, improve health and reduce inequalities.\n\nFrom the 2022 mid-year figures, it is estimated that 268,852 people live in Hull. This is an increase of 1,832 from the 2021 Census (which is just under 8,000 people higher than the original resident population estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics for mid-year 2020). From the Census, it is estimated that there are 115,500 households with at least one usual resident.\n\nHull has a relatively large population aged 20-39 years. Young people tend to move into cities to both study and work, so Hull is no different from many other cities.\n\nThe percentage of the population aged 40+ years is lower than England, and whilst the percentage aged 65+ years in Hull is lower than England, it is due to increase over time.\n\nThe age structure of the population differs across Hull with Kingswood, Marfleet and Orchard Park having the highest percentage of children aged 0-9 years, University, Orchard Park and North Carr having the highest percentages aged 10-19 years. Kingswood, Central and Newington & Gipsyville have the highest percentages aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, and Kingswood, Avenue and Central have the highest percentages aged 40-49 years. Holderness, Boothferry and Drypool have the highest percentages aged 50-59 years, and Sutton, Ings and Bricknell have the highest percentages aged 60-69 years. Pickering, Sutton and West Carr have the highest percentages aged 70-79 years, Pickering, Ings and Sutton have the highest percentages aged 80-89 years, and Bricknell, Ings and Pickering have the highest percentages aged 90+ years.\n\nWhilst the geographical boundaries are the same for the local authority and the Clinical Commissioning Group (and its successor Hull’s Health and Care Partnership or sub Integrated Care Board), the populations differ. In general, the local authority commissions services for the residents whereas the sub-ICB provides care for the patients registered with GP practices within Hull. From the GP registration file in January 2024, a total of 317,974 people were registered with a Hull GP and/or lived in Hull. Overall, 288,916 were registered with a Hull GP and lived in Hull, 3,855 lived in Hull but were registered with a GP outside of Hull (mainly East Riding of Yorkshire) and 25,203 were registered with a Hull GP but lived outside of Hull (virtually all living in East Riding of Yorkshire). Overall, 314,119 patients were registered with Hull GPs.\n\nBased on the GP registration file, 292,771 people lived in Hull which is considerably higher (by almost 24,000 people) than the resident population estimated mid-year 2022. Both estimates are subject to incorrect assumptions or errors, but it is likely that the GP registration file overestimates the population. It is also possible that the Census and the annual mid-year estimates from the Office of National Statistics slightly underestimates the resident population.\n\nWhen delivering care through primary care, the differences in the populations need to be considered as just under one in every 12 patients registered with Hull GPs live in East Riding of Yorkshire (or 8.0% of all patients overall), although this varies dramatically Hull’s 28 GP practices (from just above zero to more than half of patients).\n\nThe Population Affected – Why is it Important?\n\nIn order to improve health and reduce inequalities, it is important to understand the make-up of the local population. People at different ages and stages of their lives have different health needs. Furthermore, other characteristics such as ethnicity, socio-economic group, deprivation, poverty, gender, age, sexuality, religion and other factors may have differing health needs and also seek professional medical help to a lesser or greater degree or have problems accessing services compared to others. Certain geographical areas will have higher proportions of specific populations such as couples with young families, older people, students, and other groups and this will influence the health needs for different geographical areas. Understanding the population is an essential tool in determining current and future health needs in order to plan services, improve health and reduce inequalities.\n\nEstimates of the resident population have been produced by the Office for National Statistics after the 2021 Census so these are presented, but the Census includes additional information such as the household composition so information is also presented from the Census.\n\nThe Hull Picture\n\nResident Population\n\nFrom the Office for National Statistics mid-year population figures, it is estimated that there are 268,852 residents of Hull in 2022. This is an increase of 1,832 people from the 2021 Census when it was estimated that 267,020 people lived in Hull, and an increase of 12,729 from the Census in 2011.\n\nThere was an even split in Hull between men (134,568) and women (134,284).\n\nEach five year age band from 0-4 to 60-64 contains between 5.7% and 6.5% (between 15,297 and 17,359 people) of the overall population with the exception of those aged 20-39 years which are slightly higher (between 6.7% and 8.0%) due to the student population and young population living in the city (between 18,120 and 21,374 people). Overall, there are an estimated 41,738 people aged 65+ years living in Hull representing 15.5% of Hull’s total population.\n\nAround one quarter (24.8%) of Hull’s population was aged 0-19 years, just under one-quarter (25.2%) aged 20-36 years, one quarter (25.0%) aged 37-56 years and over one-quarter (25.0%) aged 57+ years.\n\nThe population pyramid shows the age and gender structure of Hull’s population compared to England using the mid-year 2022 population estimates.\n\nFor each five year age group, there are higher percentages of people aged under 40 years living in Hull. In Hull, the majority of the population are aged under 40 years (54.2%) compared to around half of the population for England (49.4%).\n\nThe table below gives the estimated number of residents in Hull for mid-year 2022 by five year age group.\n\nThe table below gives the number of residents in Hull from the Office for National Statistics mid-year 2022 estimates for each 10 year age group.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 215,050 people aged 16+ years and 208,683 aged 18+ years living in Hull which represent 80.0% and 77.6% of Hull’s population respectively (which are both lower than England at 81.5% and 79.2% respectively).\n\nThe population in Hull is relatively young compared to England as a whole. Cities tend to have younger populations due to students and younger people wanting to live in cities, and more families and older people tending to want to live in suburbs and in the countryside. In 2022, the median age of Hull’s population was 37.0 years and Hull was ranked 46th lowest (out of 317 lower-tier local authorities in England). This means that half of Hull’s population in 2022 is estimated to be aged 37 years or younger and half of Hull’s population is estimated to be aged 37 years or older. Tower Hamlets in London had the lowest median age at 30.5 years whereas North Norfolk had the highest median age at 55.3 years. The median age of Hull’s neighbouring East Riding of Yorkshire was 49.6 years (ranked 296 lowest of the lower-tier local authorities in England).\n\nBetween mid-year 2021 and mid-year 2022, there were 3,202 births and 2,704 deaths in Hull giving an natural increase of 498 in Hull’s population. In terms of internal migration, the Office for National Statistics estimated that there were there was an estimate inflow of 11,530 people coming into Hull over the year and an estimated 14,273 people leaving Hull in the year thus a reduction of 2,743 people overall. For international migration, there were an estimated 6,541 people coming into Hull and 1,867 people leaving Hull giving a net gain of 4,674 people due to international migration. There were a a further decrease of 93 people due to special circumstances such as changes in the armed forces and/or prison population.\n\nHull is 71.6 kilometres square and thus – from the mid-year 2022 population estimates – it is estimated that there are 3,756 residents per square kilometre.\n\nIn terms of size (square kilometres), Hull is ranked 69th lowest out of 317 lower-tier local authorities. The smallest local authority is the City of London which is only 2.9 square kilometres followed by Kensington & Chelsea which is 12.1 square kilometres. The largest local authority is North Yorkshire which is 8,037 square kilometres.\n\nIn terms of population density, Hull is ranked 45th highest out of the 317 lower-tier local authorities. Tower Hamlets has the most residents per square kilometre at 16,478 with West Devon having the lowest at 50 residents per square kilometre. England has 438 residents per square kilometre. Neighbouring East Riding of Yorkshire is 2,404 square kilometres with 346,309 residents and thus 144 residents per square kilometre.\n\nResident Population By Electoral Ward\n\nTotal Resident Population\n\nFrom the 2021 Census, Newington & Gipsyville, St Andrew’s & Docklands and Orchard Park have the largest resident populations in Hull whereas Ings, Bricknell and Pickering have the smallest resident populations.\n\nThere is a relatively even split between males and females for all wards in Hull with St Andrew’s & Docklands (54.0%), Central (53.9%) and Beverley & Newland (52.6%) having the highest percentages of males.\n\nAge Distribution of Residents Across Hull’s Wards\n\nFrom the 2021 Census, the household composition and type of properties differs across Hull’s wards, for instance, Kingswood is a ward with a high percentage of younger families, and there are a high percentage of students living near the University. Further information relating to household composition can be found in Housing and Households under Health and Wellbeing Influences. The household composition of the different wards will influence the age distribution across Hull’s electoral wards as illustrated in the following table.\n\nStatistical disclosure control was used to protect the confidentiality of individuals. This meant that where there were small numbers, data strategies were employed such as swapping records to different geographical areas based on matching characteristics and by adding ‘noise’ to some data cells using a ‘cell-key-method’ to further protect records. Therefore, it is likely that the one person recorded as being aged 90+ years living in Kingswood has been subject to statistical disclosure so it is possible that the number of residents is not exactly one, but perhaps between zero and say ten.\n\nThe following points can be made by summarising the above table for each age group:\n\nAged 0-9 years: Kingswood (17.1%) has the highest percentage aged 0-9 years, followed by Marfleet (16.9%) and Orchard Park (16.6%), whereas Bricknell (10.2%), Avenue (9.8%) and Beverley & Newland (9.5%) have the lowest percentages aged 0-9 years.\n\nAged 10-19 years: University (19.1%) has the highest percentage aged 10-19 years, followed by Orchard Park (15.1%) and North Carr (15.0%), whereas Drypool (9.9%), Derringham (9.8%) and Beverley & Newland (9.1%) have the lowest percentages aged 10-19 years.\n\nAged 20-29 years: Kingswood (21.8%) has the highest percentage aged 30-39 years, followed by Central (17.3%) and Newington & Gipsyville (17.3%), whereas Ings (12.3%), Bricknell (12.0%) and University (11.4%) have the lowest percentages aged 30-39 years.\n\nAged 30-39 years: Kingswood (21.8%) has the highest percentage aged 30-39 years, followed by Central (17.3%) and Newington & Gipsyville (17.3%),whereas Ings (12.3%), Bricknell (12.0%) and University (11.4%) have the lowest percentages aged 30-39 years.\n\nAged 40-49 years: Kingswood (15.0%) has the highest percentage aged 40-49 years, followed by Avenue (14.7%) and Central (14.5%), whereas Ings (10.6%), University (10.1%) and Marfleet (10.1%) have the lowest percentages aged 40-49 years.\n\nAged 50-59 years: Holderness (15.6%) has the highest percentage aged 50-59 years, followed by Boothferry (14.9%) and Drypool (14.8%), whereas Orchard Park (11.5%), Kingswood (10.8%) and University (8.3%) have the lowest percentages aged 50-59 years.\n\nAged 60-69 years: Sutton (13.2%) has the highest percentage aged 60-69 years, followed by Ings (12.6%) and Bricknell (12.5%), whereas North Carr (8.1%), University (6.6%) and Kingswood (5.3%) have the lowest percentages aged 60-69 years.\n\nAged 70-79 years: Pickering (10.7%) has the highest percentage aged 70-79 years, followed by Sutton (9.9%) and West Carr (9.6%), whereas Newington & Gipsyville (4.8%), University (4.2%) and Kingswood (1.9%) have the lowest percentages aged 70-79 years.\n\nAged 80-89 years: Pickering (5.4%) has the highest percentage aged 80-89 years, followed by Ings (5.3%) and Sutton (4.6%), whereas Central (2.0%), University (1.9%) and Kingswood (0.4%) have the lowest percentages aged 80-89 years.\n\nAged 90+ years: Bricknell (1.3%) has the highest percentage aged 90+ years, followed by Ings (1.2%) and Pickering (1.1%), whereas Newington & Gipsyville (0.3%), University (0.3%) and Kingswood (0.0%) have the lowest percentages aged 90+ years.\n\nIn terms of other age groups:\n\nAged 0-4 years: Kingswood (8.4%) has the highest percentage aged 0-4 years, followed by Marfleet (8.2%) and Orchard Park (8.0%), whereas Bricknell (4.8%), Holderness (4.8%) and Avenue (4.8%) have the lowest percentages aged 0-4 years.\n\nAged 0-19 years: Orchard Park (31.7%) has the highest percentage aged 0-19 years, followed by Marfleet (30.6%) and North Carr (30.3%), whereas Derringham (20.7%), Avenue (19.7%) and Beverley & Newland (18.6%) have the lowest percentages aged 0-19 years.\n\nAged 20-39 years: University (39.3%) has the highest percentage aged 20-39 years, followed by Beverley & Newland (38.8%) and Kingswood (37.3%), whereas West Carr (23.9%), Ings (23.8%) and Pickering (23.6%) have the lowest percentages aged 20-39 years.\n\nAged 40-64 years: Holderness (35.6%) has the highest percentage aged 40-64 years, followed by Drypool (34.3%) and Boothferry (34.2%), whereas Marfleet (27.6%), Orchard Park (27.5%) and University (22.0%) have the lowest percentages aged 40-64 years.\n\nAged 65+ years: Pickering (22.7%) has the highest percentage aged 65+ years, followed by Sutton (21.7%) and Ings (21.7%), whereas Central (10.9%), University (9.4%) and Kingswood (4.0%) have the lowest percentages aged 65+ years.\n\nAged 80+ years: Ings (6.6%) has the highest percentage aged 80+ years, followed by Pickering (6.5%) and Sutton (5.4%), whereas Newington & Gipsyville (2.4%), University (2.2%) and Kingswood (0.4%) have the lowest percentages aged 80+ years.\n\nParts of Kingswood, North Carr, Orchard Park, Marfleet, and Newington & Gipsyville have the highest percentages of the resident population aged 0-4 years.\n\nParts of Kingswood, North Carr, Orchard Park, Marfleet, Longhill & Bilton Grange, At Andrew’s & Docklands and Newington & Gipsyville have the highest percentages of the resident population aged 0-9 years.\n\nParts of North Carr, Orchard Park, Longhill & Bilton Grange, Marfleet, Southcoates and University have the highest percentages of the resident population aged 0-19 years.\n\nParts of Kingswood, North Carr, Marfleet and Southcoates have the highest percentages of resident population aged 20-39 years together with areas around the city centre (St Andrew’s & Docklands and Central) and around the University (University, Bricknell and Beverley & Newland).\n\nParts of Kingswood, Sutton, Longhill & Bilton Grange, Holderness, Southcoates, Drypool, Avenue , Boothferry and Bricknell have the highest percentages of people aged 40-59 years.\n\nThe areas of the city with the highest percentages of residents aged 60-69 years is quite scattered across the city with Kingwood, North Carr, Orchard Park, University, the southern parts of Beverley & Newland, and areas around the city centre the least likely to have the highest percentages of those aged 60-69 years.\n\nThe highest percentages of people aged 70-79 years tends to be in an arch around the city centre with the highest percentages in Pickering, Newington & Gipsyville, Boothferry, Derringham, Bricknell, northern Beverley & Newland, West Carr, Holderness, Sutton, Ings and Longhill & Bilton Grange.\n\nThe same areas that tend to have higher percentage of people aged 70-79 years also have a high percentage aged 80+ years, namely, Pickering, Newington & Gipsyville, Boothferry, Derringham, Bricknell, northern Beverley & Newland, Sutton, Ings and Longhill & Bilton Grange.\n\nKingswood, North Carr, University, Orchard Park, southern parts of Beverley & Newland, Avenue, Newington & Gipsyville, St Andrew’s & Docklands, Drypool, Southcoates and Marfleet tend to have the lowest percentages of those aged 60+ years.\n\nFrom the 2021 Census, the household composition also differs across Hull (more maps are included within Housing and Households within Health and Wellbeing Influences). A higher percentage of households are single person households of people aged under 66 years around the city centre, with a high percentage of multiple occupancy households (mainly students) near the University, and a mix of families with children and older people to the north, east and west of the city centre with a particularly high percentage of households containing dependent children in Kingwood and North Carr.\n\nPatient Population Registered with Local GPs\n\nBased on the general practice registration file for January 2024, the estimated resident population is noticeably higher than the Office for National Statistics’ estimate for Hull at 292,771 residents with 288,916 of these residents registered with general practices in Hull. A total of 317,694 people are either registered with a Hull GP as a patient or live in Hull based on the GP registration file for January 2024.\n\nOf the 123 patients who live beyond East Riding of Yorkshire, 40 live in North Lincolnshire, 21 live in North East Lincolnshire, 8 live in Doncaster, 6 living in Lincoln, 5 live in Leeds, and 5 live in York, but the remaining 38 patients are recorded as living in local authorities throughout England. It is possible that some of these patients lived in the city and moved away but have not yet changed their GP, and may not be an ‘active’ patient. However, it is possible that some of the patients living elsewhere do live in the city and have recorded another address as part of the GP registration process, for example, parental address given for students, or that they work in the city or divide their time between two different addresses, and may be an ‘active’ patient for the practice.\n\nOf the 317,974 people who are either registered with a Hull GP as a patient and/or live in Hull based on the GP registration file, 288,916 (90.9%) are registered with a Hull GP and live in Hull, 25,047 (7.9%) are registered with a Hull GP but live in East Riding of Yorkshire, and 3,519 (1.1%) people live in Hull but are registered with a GP in East Riding of Yorkshire. Additionally, there are a small number of people who are either registered with a Hull GP and live further afield, or who are recorded as living in Hull but are registered with a GP further afield.\n\nOf the 314,119 patients registered with Hull GPs, 25,047 (8.0%) live in East Riding of Yorkshire and this is an important consideration if services are provided via primary care.\n\nOf the 292, 771 people estimated to live in Hull based on information in GP records, 288,916 (98.7%) live in Hull, 3,519 (1.2%) live in East Riding of Yorkshire and a small number live beyond East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nAs at January 2024, the total number of patients registered with Hull general practices also differs substantially ranging from 2,768 registered patients for Delta Healthcare to 56,831 registered patients for Modality Hull.\n\nAs at January 2024, all 28 practices in Hull have patients registered with them who live in East Riding of Yorkshire and 25 practices have patients who live beyond East Riding of Yorkshire or whose local authority is not recorded. The percentage of their patients who live within East Riding of Yorkshire or other local authorities varies across Hull’s 28 GP practices from 0.6% to 52.3%. This includes a very small percentage who live beyond East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nModality Hull practice operates as a single Primary Care Network (PCN), this PCN has the highest percentage of patients living in East Riding of Yorkshire or beyond (17.4%). One in ten patients in HASP and Symphonie PCNs also live in East Riding of Yorkshire or beyond.\n\nMore than half of all patients registered with the Laurbel Surgery live in East Riding of Yorkshire, and nearly one in five patients live in East Riding of Yorkshire for Modality Hull and The Oaks Medical Centre.\n\nThe age distribution of the patients registered with Hull practices also differs.\n\nNewland Health Centre has a high proportion of students registered with the practice and as a result has a much different age structure of their patients compared to all other practices in Hull. Just under half (47.2%) of all its patients are aged 20-29 years. Of all 28 practices, it has the highest percentage of patients aged 18-24 and 25-39 years, and the lowest percentage of patients aged aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80-89 years.\n\nExcluding Newland Health Centre, the following statements can be made in relation to the age distribution of patients:\n\nAged 0-4 years: The percentage of the population aged 0-4 years ranges from 3.7% for Laurbel Surgery to 8.5% for Haxby – Kingswood & Orchard Park.\n\nAged 5-11 years: The percentage of the population aged 5-11 years ranges from 6.1% for Hastings Medical Centre to 12.6% for Haxby – Kingswood & Orchard Park.\n\nAged 12-17 years: The percentage of the population aged 12-17 years ranges from 4.3% for Wilberforce Surgery to 9.2% for Raut Partnership.\n\nAged 18-24 years: The percentage of the population aged 18-24 years ranges from 5.6% for Hastings Medical Centre to 8.8% for CHCP – City Centre.\n\nAged 25-39 years: The percentage of the population aged 25-39 years ranges from 26.9% for Haxby – Kingswood & Orchard Park to 35.7% for Clifton House Medical Centre.\n\nAged 40-64 years: The percentage of the population aged 40-64 years ranges from 11.5% for Laurbel Surgery to 22.8% for Wilberforce Surgery.\n\nAged 65-79 years: The percentage of the population aged 65-79 years ranges from 6.1% for Haxby – Kingswood & Orchard Park to 22.3% for Laurbel Surgery.\n\nAged 80-89 years: The percentage of the population aged 80-89 years ranges from 1.2% for Wilberforce Surgery to 6.6% for Hastings Medical Centre.\n\nAged 90+ years: The percentage of the population aged 90+ years ranges from 0.2% for Haxby – Kingswood & Orchard Park to 1.2% in Haxby – Burnbrae Surgery.\n\nDifferences in Resident and GP Population Estimates\n\nThe total estimated resident population from the GP registration file (as at January 2024) is considerably different from the estimated number of residents from Office for National Statistics mid-year estimates for 2022. From ONS’s mid-year estimates for 2022, it was estimated that 268,852 people lived in Hull, so with an estimated 292,771 residents from the GP registration file, the GP registration file gives an estimate of 23,919 residents higher (or 8.2% higher).\n\nONS produce annual estimates based on the Census, ageing people each year, adding births and subtracting deaths, and adding adjustments to estimate local, national and international migration. Whilst it is a legal requirement to complete a Census form, the Census is an underestimate as not everybody completes the Census particularly men, younger people and those living in the most deprived areas. ONS adjust the figures to try to account for this under-count. ONS uses the GP registrations to estimate local and national migration, and there are other sources of data to estimate international migration, but these data sources are not complete and comprehensive. So migration will comprise the largest error component, and furthermore the error rate increases with each successive mid-year estimate until the next Census. The original estimates for mid-year 2020 were based on the 2011 Census, and there was a noticeable jump in Hull’s population estimate following the 2021 Census. ONS with a difference of almost 8,000 residents between the original mid-year 2020 estimates and the 2021 Census. The largest differences (7% or more) occurred among those aged 15-19 years, 35-44 years, 50-54 years, 60-64 years and 90+ years.\n\nAs there is generally a difference between the last mid-year estimate in a series (just before a new Census) and a new Census, ONS back-revise their estimates for previous years after a Census. ONS published their back-revised figures for the mid-year populations from 2011 to 2020 in November 2023 as well as publishing new mid-year population estimates for 2022. With the back-revised estimates, it means that the mid-year population estimate for Hull for 2020 was increased to 267,591 (from the original estimate of 259,126) so there was not such a large increase between 2020 and 2021, but a more gradual increase between 2011 and 2020 as recognised by the increase in population following the 2021 Census.\n\nWhilst the GP registration file is a count of real people, it is not necessarily more accurate. People who move house do not always inform their GP of their new address, and they do not always register with a new GP practice if they have moved too far to attend their GP practice. Once someone registers with a new GP they are automatically removed from the practice list of their old practice (but this will not happen if they move abroad). Thus it is possible that people move to Hull and live in Hull some time before registering with a local GP, and people can move away from Hull but not update their GP with their new address or change their GP to a practice local near to where they move. This is particularly the case for young people especially men, who generally use their GP less frequently.\n\nThus both the ONS and GP registration file estimates of resident population will not be totally accurate. In general, the ONS population estimates and the Census estimates are used as the official figures for resident population estimates. It is possible that they underestimate the population slightly, but it is likely that the GP registration file overestimates the resident population.\n\nStrategic Need and Service Provision\n\nAt different life-stages, people have very different needs. For instance, among areas with a high percentage of families, maternal health, breastfeeding, vaccinations, and a good start in life are important issues. Students and young people may need advice and support in relation to lifestyle and behavioural factors such as alcohol and smoking, mental health, and sexual health. People of working age may have needs in relation to employment, mental health, sexual health, and lifestyle and behavioural risk factors, such as smoking and diet. Older people will tend to have more long-term conditions, and needs in relation to falls and hip fractures, dementia, and mental health including social isolation.\n\nBecause approximately 26,000+ “extra” people registered with Hull GPs live in East Riding of Yorkshire, if services are delivered through primary care, account needs to be taken of these non-Hull residents on the lists of Hull general practices.\n\nAs well as understanding the gender and current age structure of the local population, it is important to examine the future projections for the age and gender structure of the population (see Population Projections also under Population) as well as other factors which influence health and the need for health services such as Race and Ethnicity, and other factors such as deprivation, housing, employment, etc (see Health and Wellbeing Influences) as well as where different groups of people live in the city (see Ward and Area Committee Profiles under Place).\n\nResources\n\nOffice for National Statistics population estimates: www.ons.gov.uk\n\nOffice for National Statistics.
