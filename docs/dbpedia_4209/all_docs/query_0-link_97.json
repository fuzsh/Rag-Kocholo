At the beginning of World War l in 1914 there were not enough Nuns to do nursing of the wounded so in January 1915 the Canadian government put out the call for trained nurses to serve in the war. At first there were 70 positions and 2,000 trained certified nurses applied. During World War 1 (1914-1918) 3,141 trained nurses enlisted with the Canadian Army Medical Corps. 2,500 of these nurses served overseas. They were given the rank of lieutenant making them the first women in the Commonwealth to be officers in the military. The Canadian Nursing Sisters were nicknamed 'bluebirds' since their uniforms were a light blue double-breasted blouse with and open collar and a long blue skirt. They wore a white veil head covering and a white apron was worn over top of the uniform. They were paid $4.10 a day with room and board included. These courageous and adventuresome women provided medical services for Canadian and Allied troops and enemy prisoners of war at the war near the front in Europe and they operated treatment facilities and hospitals in rear areas of France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Some 50 Nursing Sisters were casualties of disease or enemy action such as bombings, or sinking of ships. The women earned the admiration and affection of their patients who referred to them as Sisters of Mercy or Angels of Mercy. I have included in this listing of nurses over 300 stories of these courageous and adventuresome women as samples of the dedication of the over 3,000 women who served.

While nursing in Hailabury Hospital in northern Ontario, René (she pronounced it Reen) came across an old woman who had survived much longer with cancer than doctors had projected. The old lady had used a remedy that she said was an old Indian cure for cancer. The old lady shared the recipe for this life saving tea and René, whose goal was to control cancer and alleviate pain, used it to help cancer patients, including her own mother, who were considered to be incurable. René began to refine the herbal tea. She joined with Dr R. D. Fisher to study in a makeshift lab and began to research on mice with the herbal tea and found it to be successful in treating breast cancer and other cancers. They isolated what they deemed was the herb responsible for reducing the tumors and called their product ESSIAC which is Renés surname spelled backwards. In 1926 she was charged with practicing medicine without a license by the Canadian Government. Thus began a 50 year controversy over this cure. From 1928 through 1930 René worked at the Christie Street Hospital Laboratories, Toronto and even consulted with Dr. Frederick Banting (1891-1941), one of the discoverers of Insulin) but she always kept the formula of Essiac to herself. She opened a cancer clinic in Bracebridge, Ontario where tending patients deemed hopeless by other doctors. René continued to treat patients in Bracebridge even though her cure fell out of favour. She married Charles McCaughey, a North Bay Lawyer, and former patient but retained her maiden name. In retirement she took up oil painting. In 1977 René handed her formula to the Resperin Corporation, controlled by uranium magnate Stephen Roman of Toronto who paid $250.00 during a test period and promised of a share in future profits. In 1985 a Dr. Gary Glum purchased the formula for $120,000.00 from one of Renés former patients and released this formula into public domain in 1988. He wrote a book, Calling of an Angel: Essiac Natures cure for Cancer. Mary McPherson who had worked with René in preparing the formula did not want to die with the controversy over her head so she released the formula, as she had prepared it, to public domain on December 23, 1994. Today several versions of Essiac are on the market sold as a natural remedy. The Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre was built and named in her honour in her hometown of Bracebridge.Sources: Obituary.
