        "text": "One of the Boys, which I consider perhaps Roger Daltrey’s most criminally underrated solo album that deserved much better success, was recorded from November 1976–March 1977 at The Who’s Ramport Studios in London and Pathé Marconi Studios in Paris. Because of tax complications, the vocals had to be recorded in Paris instead of at home.\n\nThe album has a more eclectic sound and consistently high-quality material because Roger enlisted the help of a larger group of songwriters instead of just one or two main people with their own particular style. He also used a lot more musicians than on his previous two solo albums.\n\nFor the third time in a row, Roger’s cousin Graham Hughes designed and photographed the album art. The cover is modelled after René Magritte’s painting Not to Be Reproduced, which also depicts the subject reflected from the back instead of showing his face.\n\nRoger generously let students from a nearby technical school in the Battersea district film the London recording sessions for an educational project they were doing.\n\nRoger co-wrote three of the songs, his first time since “Here for More” in 1970 he’d done any songwriting. When he puts his mind to it, he’s more than capable of producing a nice tune. His musical calling, however, is obviously singing, which is where he’s chosen to focus his strengths and develop his talents.\n\nOne of the Boys was recorded during a six-month sabbatical from The Who, and Roger felt it would finally establish a coherent musical direction for himself as a solo artist. In a 1977 Rolling Stone interview, he said, “It’s always been difficult for me to do that up till now. I’ve always said that if I wanted to make a rock and roll album I’d do it with The Who, because that’s the finest rock and roll vehicle in the world. It would be pointless to do second-best to that. But there are all kinds of music The Who don’t touch.”\n\nIn that interview, Roger also admitted feeling overwhelmed and inhibited by Pete’s constant, excellent supply of songs, “but a solo album seemed a good opportunity to put my own material to the test.” His prior songs were “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” (single; co-written with Pete), “See My Way” (on A Quick One), “Early Morning Cold Taxi” (outtake from The Who Sell Out), and the abovementioned “Here for More” (B-side of “The Seeker”).\n\n“The Prisoner” was inspired by John McVicar, an armed robber and prison escapee whom Roger later portrayed in a 1980 biopic. Roger was so fascinated by his stories of prison life, he bought the film rights to Mr. McVicar’s memoir.\n\nTrack listing, with stars by the bonus tracks:\n\n“Parade” (written by Phillip Goodhand-Tait)\n\n“Single Man’s Dilemma” (Colin Blunstone)\n\n“Avenging Annie” (Andy Pratt) (#88 in the U.S.)\n\n“The Prisoner” (Roger, David Courtney, S. Todd)\n\n“Leon” (Phillip Goodhand-Tait)\n\n“One of the Boys” (Steve Gibbons) (features backing vocals and bass by John Entwistle, whose deep “Boris the Spider” voice you can’t miss)\n\n“Giddy” (Paul McCartney)\n\n“Say It Ain’t So, Joe” (Murray Head)\n\n“Written on the Wind” (Paul Korda) (#46 in the U.K.)\n\n“Satin and Lace” (Roger, David Courtney, Tony Meehan)\n\n“Doing It All Again” (Roger, David Courtney, Tony Meehan)\n\n“You Put Something Better Inside Me”* (Gerry Rafferty, Joe Egan)\n\n“Martyrs and Madmen”* (Steve Swindells)\n\n“Treachery”* (Steve Swindells)\n\nI love every single song on this album! It’s held up so well over time, and is hands-down one of Roger’s strongest, finest solo albums. Sadly, it wasn’t promoted well enough, and only achieved modest chart success (#45 in the U.K., #46 in the U.S., #80 in Australia). I’d highly recommend it as a great place to start exploring Roger’s solo work."
