        "text": "Everlasting Love: RPM Collects The Complete Love Affair and Steve Ellis On CBS\n\nA recent release from Cherry Red's RPM Records imprint opens with a bold statement in its liner notes: \"In 1968, only The Beatles sold more records in Britain than The Love Affair\" - surprising but true! Today, the band is best-known for its hit \"Everlasting Love,\" a U.K. Number One that still is in rotation on oldies radio. But in the brief period between January 1968 and July 1969, The Love Affair scored five U.K. Top 20 hits. The Love Affair and Steve Ellis' Time Hasn't Changed Us: The\n\nI Love Being Here With You: Peggy Lee's \"Live in London\" Box Set Coming In December\n\nA pair of rare albums by the legendary Miss Peggy Lee are getting the deluxe, expanded treatment this fall from Universal Music. Peggy Lee: Live in London is the title of the new 4-CD box set due on December 4 containing the soulful songstress' 1977 studio album Peggy; the concert album Live in London recorded at the famous Palladium on March 13, 1977; an entire disc of previously unreleased material including studio outtakes, rehearsal takes and the March 20 Palladium show; and a DVD of the\n\nBill Wyman Opens The Vault Doors with \"The Solo Box,\" \"Complete Willie and the Poor Boys\" Sets\n\nEarlier this year, erstwhile Rolling Stone bassist Bill Wyman released Back to Basics, his fifth solo album and first in over two decades. The time couldn't be better, then, to revisit Wyman's past work apart from his former bandmates. Edsel has happily obliged with two new multi-disc collections in the Bill Wyman's Recording Archives series showcasing Wyman's own musical melange of blues, soul, pop, and rock-and-roll. The 4-CD/1-DVD White Lightnin': The Solo Box reissues and expands Wyman's\n\nBREAKING! Return To Cypress Avenue: Rhino Remasters, Expands Van Morrison's \"Astral Weeks,\" \"His Band and the Street Choir\"\n\nThere's even more coming from Van Morrison! Following up on 2013's multi-disc deluxe edition of the Northern Irish soul man's 1970 classic Moondance and on the heels of Legacy Recordings' announcement earlier this week that the Sony imprint has acquired the majority of Morrison's post-1971 catalogue, Rhino has just announced two new deluxe editions drawn from Morrison's seminal early Warner Bros. discography. Both 1968's label debut Astral Weeks and 1970's jubilant His Band and the Street\n\nLet's Go Disco: Big Break Gets Down With MFSB's \"Universal Love\"\n\nBig Break Records is letting the love come through - Universal Love, that is! - with its new reissue of the third album from Philadelphia International Records' inimitable house band, MFSB. The only mystery about the 1975 album is how this No. 2 R&B smash (and respectable No. 44 Pop success, as well) has avoided compact disc release after all these years. Happily, it follows 1972's MFSB and 1973's Love is the Message into Big Break's catalogue in a newly-expanded and remastered\n\nThe Milk of Human Kindness: Esoteric Expands Third and Fourth Procol Harum Albums\n\nEsoteric Recordings has just continued its series of expanded Procol Harum reissues with A Salty Dog and Home, the band's third and fourth albums as originally released in 1969 and 1970, respectively, on the Regal Zonophone label. As with Esoteric's reissues of Procol Harum and Shine On Brightly, both titles are available in single- and multiple-disc configurations with bonus tracks culled from past reissues plus previously unreleased material. After initial sessions held in Los Angeles\n\nIn Memoriam: Cilla Black (1943-2015)\n\nWe're deeply saddened at the news of the passing of Cilla Black, 72. Throughout the course of a recording career spanning five decades, the Liverpool-born artist lent her distinctive sound and big voice to songs by The Beatles (\"Love of the Loved,\" \"It's for You,\" Step Inside Love\"), Burt Bacharach and Hal David (\"Alfie,\" \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\"), Randy Newman (\"I've Been Wrong Before\") and the greatest songwriters of her era. Also beloved in the United Kingdom as a television presenter on\n\nTogether In Perfect Harmony: Paul McCartney's \"Tug of War\" and \"Pipes Of Peace\" Join Archive Collection\n\nAt last, we can say, say, say it's true: the next two volumes of the Paul McCartney Archive Collection are on their way for October 2 release in a variety of formats. Macca's second and third albums of the 1980s, the platinum sellers Tug of War and Pipes of Peace, will arrive from Concord Records and MPL with the expected array of bonus material, highlighted by a complete 2015 remix of Tug of War. 1982's Tug of War marked McCartney's first album following the breakup of Wings. It followed\n\nComes Love: JSP Readies Judy Garland's \"The Best of Lost Tracks\" with New-to-CD Tracks\n\nThis December, JSP Records will revisit the musical legacy of the one and only Judy Garland with a new single-disc collection that draws on a past release while offering new-to-CD material, as well. The Best of Lost Tracks 1929-1959 is based on the label's 2010 box set Lost Tracks which received international acclaim for its presentation of 100 rare tracks from the late superstar - 55 of which (including her two earliest solo recordings) were previously unissued. This release presents 22\n\nReturn to \"Battersea Power Station\": Esoteric Reissues Debut of Junior's Eyes, Onetime Bowie Backing Band\n\nCherry Red's Esoteric Recordings imprint has recently unearthed another rock cult classic. Battersea Power Station, from Junior's Eyes, was produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T Rex) and appeared in June 1969 on EMI's Regal Zonophone label. Alas, it was to be the band's only original album release. Esoteric has dusted off Battersea Power Station and reinvigorated the album as a 2-CD set with a bonus disc of singles, demos and sessions, some previously unreleased. Junior's Eyes was led\n\nSatisfy Your Soul: RPM Collects Rare Rock and Soul from Larry's Rebels and Ronnie Jones\n\nRPM Records, an imprint of the Cherry Red Group, continues to delve deep into the vaults for another pair of rare rock-and-roll releases. Larry's Rebels has long been a beloved band to fans in the group's native New Zealand; with RPM's release of I Feel Good: The Essential Purple Flashes of Larry's Rebels 1965-1969, the rest of the world can get hip to the Rebels, too! Active for a rough five-year period during which time the band, like so many others, endured personnel changes, Larry's\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of July 10\n\nWelcome to today's Release Round-Up for the first international Friday release date! Like you, we're still adjusting to the switch from Monday in the U.K./Tuesday in the U.S. to a worldwide Friday date. Please sound off in the comments below on whether you would like to see us run this longtime feature each Friday, or earlier in the week (so that you may plan ahead for Release Day)! The Hollies, Changin' Times: The Complete Hollies, January '69 - March '73 (Parlophone) (Amazon U.S. /\n\nGet On Up, Get On Down: Roy Ayers' Jazz, Funk and Disco Revisited On \"Searching for Sunshine\"\n\nIn a career spanning six decades, vibraphonist and composer Roy Ayers has pushed the boundaries of jazz, transitioning from bop to soul-jazz, funk and acid jazz. Three classic albums from the \"Godfather of Neo-Soul\" have recently been reissued by Australia's Raven Records label with a handful of bonus selections, as well. The 2-CD set Searching for Sunshine: 1973-1980 collects Ayers' Polydor albums You Send Me (1978), Fever (1979) and No Stranger to Love (1979) and then dips into other areas\n\nWhiter Shades: Esoteric Kicks Off Deluxe Reissue Campaign For Procol Harum\n\nCherry Red's Esoteric Recordings imprint is skipping the light fandango with its new reissue campaign dedicated to the classic albums of Procol Harum. Though these titles have been previously issued on CD before (including recent, now out-of-print deluxe editions from Salvo Music), Esoteric's new editions boast previously unreleased music and other new bonuses as well as copiously-annotated booklets and restored original album artwork. The first two titles in the series, 1967's Procol Harum\n\nCan't Get It Out Of My Head: Jeff Lynne and ELO's 2014 Hyde Park Concert Gets Fall Release\n\nLast September, 50,000 lucky spectators bore witness to Jeff Lynne's return to the concert stage when the Electric Light Orchestra frontman took the stage at London's Hyde Park for the most eagerly-anticipated performance of BBC Radio 2's Festival in a Day. Now, Lynne's performance - backed by his band (including ELO's Richard Tandy) and the BBC Concert Orchestra - is coming to DVD, Blu-ray and digital formats. On September 11, Eagle Rock Entertainment will release Live in Hyde Park preserving\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of June 30\n\nWelcome to our final Tuesday Release Round-Up - and it's a doozy! As many of you know, the record industry will next week adopt a universal Friday release day. No releases are scheduled for Tuesday, July 7; instead, Friday, July 10 is the date! DVDs and Blu-rays will, for the foreseeable future, remain released on Tuesdays. We'll resume with a new Release Round-Up on Friday, July 10! Ronny and the Daytonas, The Complete Recordings (2-CD Set) (Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K.) / The\n\nLong Live Love: RPM Collects Sixties Sound of The Stormsville Shakers\n\nPhillip Goodhand-Tait has had his songs recorded by artists ranging from Gene Pitney to Roger Daltrey and has also fronted a number of bands in his many decades in the music industry. Cherry Red Group imprint RPM has collected 27 tracks by singer-musician-songwriter Goodhand-Tait, solo and with his bands The Stormsville Shakers and Circus as One and One is Two: Complete Recordings 1965-1967. Born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, Goodhand-Tait began his music career while still in\n\nHang On To Yourself: David Bowie's \"Five Years 1969-1973\" Box Collects Albums, Bonus Discs\n\nForty-four years to the day after David Bowie first performed at Glastonbury (then known as the Glastonbury Fair rather than today's Festival), Parlophone Records has announced the first in a new series of box sets which will eventually span his entire career. Five Years: 1969-1973, named of course after the opening track of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, will be available on September 25 in 12-CD or 13-LP configurations, containing all of the core material (ten\n\nIn Memoriam: Back Tracks - James Horner (1953-2015)\n\nWe're deeply saddened to share the news of the tragic and unexpected death of film composer James Horner whose stirring melodies have thrilled, excited and inspired generations of moviegoers on films like Aliens, Avatar, An American Tail, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and of course, Titanic. Back on March 8, 2010, our own Mike Duquette paid tribute to the Horner legacy with a special installment of Back Tracks. In memory of Mr. Horner and his immense contributions to cinema and music, we're\n\nBreak On Through: The Doors' \"Other Voices\" and \"Full Circle\" Come To CD, LP\n\nA lost chapter of The Doors' story is finally coming to light this fall. On September 4, Rhino will reissue for the very first time on officially-sanctioned CD and 180-gram vinyl the two albums released by The Doors - John Densmore, guitarist Robby Krieger, and keyboardist Ray Manzarek - following the 1971 death of Jim Morrison: Other Voices (1971) and Full Circle (1972). The albums will be made available as a two-CD set, newly remastered by The Doors' longtime associate and original Other\n\nCherry Red's él Label Mines Jazz and Beyond with Django Reinhardt, Grant Green and More\n\nCherry Red's él label is in a jazz mood with three recent releases from two late legends of the guitar, Django Reinhardt and Grant Green, and one fondly-remembered group, The Temperance Seven! Though Django Reinhardt (1910-1953) lived to just 43 years of age, the Belgian-born French guitarist of Romani descent invented a wholly new vocabulary for jazz guitar, sometimes referred to as \"gypsy jazz.\" Able to use just two fingers on his left hand, he created a singular style of swing thanks to\n\nYou Can't Ever Come Down: Esoteric Revisits \"The American Metaphysical Circus\"\n\n\"We were firmly in the American tradition of artistic and political radicalism intermixed with patriotism, and to thus establish a psychic 'distance' from The Beatles.\" So stated Joseph Byrd in a 2004 interview excerpted in the liner notes to Esoteric Recordings' new reissue of 1969's The American Metaphysical Circus. The album, credited to Joe Byrd and the Hippies, exemplified the adventuresome spirit of the era which led the venerable Columbia Records label to sign a number of\n\nAce Collects Good Vibrations On \"Here Today! The Songs of Brian Wilson\"\n\n2015 has been a banner year for Brian Wilson. The Beach Boys legend has already released a new album, is currently preparing for a tour with Searching for Sugar Man cult hero Rodriguez, and will next month see the full release in theatres of his biopic Love and Mercy. Ace Records is joining the celebration with the June 29 U.K. release (July 10 in the U.S.) of Here Today! The Songs of Brian Wilson. One of Ace's first releases in its Songwriters and Producers Series was 2003's Pet Projects:\n\nReview: Wes Montgomery, \"In the Beginning\"\n\nNever-before-heard music by Wes Montgomery isn't easy to come by. Montgomery - an influence to George Benson, Jimi Hendrix, Pat Metheny and every great guitar man in between - didn't enter a recording studio until 25 years of age, didn't record as a leader until another ten years had elapsed, and was dead ten years after that, felled by a heart attack at age 45. His body of work can neatly be divided into three distinct periods at different labels: Riverside (1959-1964), Verve (1964-1966) and"
