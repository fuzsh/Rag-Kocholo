        "text": "Retro NBA Nut\n\nOVR: 19\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2008\n\nLocation: Ireland\n\nPosts: 1,572\n\nBlog Entries: 17\n\nMike Hobbs Takes the Reins: A New Era for the Clippers.\n\nMike Hobbs Takes the Reins: A New Era for the Clippers.\n\nMarch 20, 2009.\n\nIn a move that signifies a seismic shift within the Los Angeles Clippers organization, Mike Hobbs has been named the new President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. The announcement comes on the heels of Steve Ballmer's recent acquisition of the team, marking the beginning of what Clippers fans hope will be a brighter, more successful era.\n\nAs the Clippers limp through the final stretch of a dismal season, sporting a disheartening 17-51 record, Hobbs' arrival brings a much-needed breath of fresh air. His first order of business: taking over the GM duties from Mike Dunleavy, who will remain head coach for the remainder of the season. Dunleavy, whose dual role had clearly taken its toll, will now focus solely on coaching as the team embarks on a grueling Eastern Conference road trip.\n\nThe Return of Mike Hobbs\n\nFor those who have followed the NBA closely, Mike Hobbs is no stranger. Once the promising GM of the Utah Jazz, Hobbs' tenure was abruptly cut short in the 2002-03 season when Jerry Sloan ousted him in a controversial power play. Disillusioned, Hobbs retreated from the basketball world, choosing to spend time with his family in Boston. For years, he watched his children grow, occasionally fielding calls from NBA teams that sought his expertise but never finding the right fit. Until now.\n\nHobbs' return to the NBA, under the ambitious and energetic ownership of Steve Ballmer, is a statement of intent. Ballmer, fresh off his role as Microsoft's CEO, is bringing his signature enthusiasm and business acumen to the Clippers, and he sees Hobbs as the perfect partner in this transformative venture.\n\n\"I am honored and excited to join the Clippers at such a pivotal moment,\" Hobbs said at his introductory press conference. \"This franchise has immense potential, and I look forward to working with Coach Dunleavy, the players, and the entire organization to build a winning culture.\"\n\nA Tumultuous Season\n\nTo say the Clippers have struggled this season would be an understatement. With a 17-51 record, the team has been plagued by inconsistency, injuries, and a lack of cohesion on both ends of the floor. As they head off on a 10-day Eastern Conference road trip, the focus will inevitably shift to Hobbs and his vision for the future.\n\nHobbs is expected to attend several games during the road trip, using the time to meet with Coach Dunleavy, players, and other key personnel. His presence alone is likely to inject a sense of urgency and optimism into a team desperate for direction.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nSo, what can we expect from Hobbs' tenure? For starters, his reputation as a keen basketball mind and talent evaluator precedes him. During his time with the Jazz and the Knicks, Hobbs was instrumental in assembling competitive rosters and had a knack for finding diamonds in the rough. The Clippers, who have historically struggled with player development and scouting, stand to benefit greatly from his expertise.\n\nOne immediate challenge will be assessing the current roster and identifying core pieces to build around. With the NBA Draft and free agency looming, Hobbs' decisions in the coming months will set the tone for the Clippers' future. Will he look to build through the draft, leveraging the team's likely high pick? Or will he make bold moves in the trade market to accelerate the rebuild?\n\nAnother critical aspect will be his relationship with Dunleavy. The veteran coach, now relieved of his GM duties, will need to align with Hobbs' vision for the team. Their ability to work together effectively will be crucial in navigating the rest of the season and laying the groundwork for future success.\n\nA New Hope for Clippers Fans\n\nFor a fan base long accustomed to disappointment, the arrival of Ballmer and Hobbs represents a new dawn. The Clippers have spent decades in the shadow of their more illustrious neighbors, the Lakers, but with the right leadership, they have the potential to carve out their own legacy.\n\nAs the team embarks on this road trip, all eyes will be on Mike Hobbs and his initial moves as the new GM. His decisions, both immediate and long-term, will shape the destiny of the Clippers for years to come.\n\nIn the end, the Clippers' journey from perennial underdogs to contenders won't be easy, but with Hobbs at the helm, there is finally a sense of direction and hope. The road to redemption starts now, and Clippers fans can finally dare to dream of better days ahead.\n\nFor more on this developing story and other NBA news, stay tuned to Grantland.\n\nLast edited by RMJH4; 07-21-2024 at 04:02 AM.\n\nRetro NBA Nut\n\nOVR: 19\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2008\n\nLocation: Ireland\n\nPosts: 1,572\n\nBlog Entries: 17\n\nGame 69: LA Clippers 90 - 108 Detroit Pistons.\n\nGame 69: LA Clippers 90 - 108 Detroit Pistons.\n\nMarch 20th, 2009 by NBA.com\n\nClippers Starters\n\nB.

McDyess (Pistons)\n\n24pts, 17 rebs, 1 ast, 2 blks\n\nGame Recap by David Aldridge.\n\nIn a commanding performance at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Detroit Pistons overpowered the LA Clippers, cruising to a 108-90 victory. The night belonged to Antonio McDyess, who led the Pistons with a stellar double-double, racking up 24 points and 17 rebounds, and showcasing why he remains a force in the paint.\n\nDetroit wasted no time establishing their dominance. McDyess set the tone early, controlling the glass and providing crucial second-chance points. His defensive presence was equally impactful, as he tied for the team lead in blocks with two, reinforcing the Pistons' interior defense.\n\nTayshaun Prince was the orchestrator, dishing out 12 assists and facilitating a smooth offensive flow. His court vision and unselfish play allowed Detroit to maintain a balanced scoring attack, keeping the Clippers’ defense on their heels all night.\n\nAllen Iverson brought his trademark intensity to the floor, notching three steals and turning defensive plays into fast-break opportunities. Iverson's energy and disruptive play were pivotal in keeping the Clippers' backcourt under pressure, resulting in multiple turnovers.\n\nThe Clippers, despite a promising starting lineup struggled to find their footing. Randolph and Gordon had moments of brilliance, but the team as a whole couldn't match Detroit’s execution and consistency.\n\nDetroit's supporting cast, including Arron Afflalo and Kwame Brown, played crucial roles. Afflalo’s perimeter defense and Brown’s presence in the paint were key in stifling the Clippers' offensive efforts.\n\nAs the final buzzer sounded, the Pistons celebrated a comprehensive team win, underscored by McDyess' outstanding performance. For the Clippers, this game was a stark reminder of the challenges they face on their Eastern Conference road trip. With their record now at 17-51, the Clippers must regroup and find ways to spark their struggling season.\n\nLast edited by RMJH4; 07-21-2024 at 04:02 AM.\n\nRetro NBA Nut\n\nOVR: 19\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2008\n\nLocation: Ireland\n\nPosts: 1,572\n\nBlog Entries: 17\n\nGame 70: LA Clippers 76 - 96 Toronto Raptors\n\nGame 70: LA Clippers 76 - 96 Toronto Raptors.\n\nMarch 22nd, 2009 by NBA.com\n\nClippers Starters\n\nB.

Bosh (Raptors)\n\n16pts, 13 rebs, 1 ast, 2 stls, 1 blk\n\nGame Recap by David Aldridge.\n\nIn a game that highlighted the contrasting fortunes of two NBA franchises, the Toronto Raptors convincingly defeated the LA Clippers 96-76 at the Air Canada Centre. The Raptors, led by the dynamic frontcourt duo of Chris Bosh and Shawn Marion, showcased their playoff aspirations, while the Clippers continued to struggle in a difficult season.\n\nToronto's control of the game was evident from the start. Bosh and Marion dominated the boards, each grabbing 13 rebounds, ensuring the Raptors maintained a decisive edge in the paint. Bosh also contributed significantly on the offensive end, complementing Marion's relentless energy and defensive prowess.\n\nJose Calderon orchestrated the Raptors' offense with finesse, dishing out 8 assists and keeping the Clippers' defense on its toes. Calderon's efficient playmaking was a key factor in Toronto's balanced scoring attack, which systematically dismantled the Clippers' defense.\n\nAnthony Parker's defensive intensity was another highlight for the Raptors. Parker recorded 4 steals, disrupting the Clippers' offensive rhythm and creating fast-break opportunities that Toronto capitalized on.\n\nFor the Clippers, Zach Randolph was the lone bright spot, leading his team with 20 points. Despite Randolph's efforts, the Clippers struggled to find consistent scoring from the rest of the lineup. Eric Gordon showed flashes of brilliance, particularly on the defensive end with 2 blocks, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide.\n\nBy the end of the fourth quarter, the Raptors had solidified their dominance, sending a clear message to the rest of the league about their playoff intentions. For the Clippers, now 17-53, it was another night of introspection and a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead as they continue their arduous road trip.\n\nLast edited by RMJH4; 07-21-2024 at 04:02 AM."
