        "text": "Dallas Mavericks Acquire Caron Butler in Seven-Player Trade\n\nOn February 13th, 2010, the Washington Wizards traded forward Caron Butler, center Brendan Haywood and guard DeShawn Stevenson to the Dallas Mavericks for forwards Drew Gooden, Josh Howard, Quinton Ross and James Singleton.\n\nThe Washington Wizards were in one of the more precarious and chaotic positions in modern day NBA history. The franchise was in a free-fall amidst the Gilbert Arenas incident. To make matters worse, the team wasn’t performing well either.\n\nThe Wizards had the choice of trucking along with high-priced stars or rebuilding with the team’s foundation crumbling by the second. The first domino to fall centered around former All-Star forward Caron Butler during the month of the 2010 trade deadline.\n\nWith the Dallas Mavericks keen on setting up a championship run, the Wizards obliged and put this seven-player deal into play.\n\nAt the All-Star break, the Mavericks were 32-21, fourth place in the West, and closer to ninth place (four games ahead) than to first (eight and a half games out). They had lost six of their last eight games. The team needed a boost and saw a need for a trade to re-shuffle their roster and compete in the highly competitive Western Conference.\n\nOne big piece the Mavericks had was forward Josh Howard who had an expensive team option at the end of the season which essentially made him an expiring contract. Howard had fallen out of favor in Dallas after numerous incidents including him announcing that he smokes marijuana publicly. Howard’s stock as an All-Star caliber player had cratered in Dallas, and the Mavericks had been looking to deal him for quite some time.\n\nThe Wizards on the other hand were 17-33 at the time of the trade. The team had absolutely fallen apart on the court and off the court. The franchise went all in by dealing its 2009 first rounder to the Timberwolves for Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Injuries, dissension, and chemistry issues caused this Wizards team to fall apart.\n\nOne major incident was the Gilbert Arenas-Javaris Crittenton moment when both players brought guns into an NBA locker room. This situation was unprecedented for the Wizards let alone the NBA. Both Arenas and Crittenton were suspended for the rest of the season and this incident was the beginning of the end for the Wizards roster.\n\nThe centerpiece of this deal was Caron Butler. The former All-Star forward’s final few months with the Wizards were below par compared to his first three years. He had a public spat with teammate Gilbert Arenas, who claimed that he wasn’t on the same page as the rest of his teammates. He struggled to adjust to head coach Flip Saunders’ point guard-centered offense after thriving under Eddie Jordan’s Princeton offense, which requires more playmaking from forwards.\n\nButler also sulked after failing to receive a contract extension before the 2009-10 season began. With Butler’s contract set to expire after the 2010-11 season, Grunfeld didn’t want to tie up any money long-term to a team that lost three straight first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers after committing about $161 million in contracts to Arenas and Jamison in the summer or 2008.\n\nButler wanted a more prominent role in the offense, which led to him breaking off and freestyling from time to time. He famously went against a play Saunders called for Randy Foye and missed a game-winning attempt against Dallas on Jan. 26. According to team insiders, he sometimes complained about not getting enough shots (via Washington Post)\n\nThe Wizards had been talking to several teams for weeks about trades involving Butler and center Brendan Haywood. One scenario involved the Houston Rockets and Tracy McGrady’s $22.5 million expiring contract going to the Wizards for the Butler-Haywood package.\n\nTalks with the Mavericks had stalled in the past week prior to the trade, partly because of Washington’s insistence that the Mavericks take DeShawn Stevenson in any deal involving Butler going to Dallas. When Washington agreed late in the week that it would add Haywood to the deal, talks picked up on Thursday the 11th and only grew more serious on Friday the 12th. Many people regarded this trade as the first major domino needed to loosen things up on the trade market in advance of the annual trading deadline on the 18th.\n\nThe Wizards wanted prospect guard Rodrigue Beaubois added to the deal, but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said that the young guard was untouchable.\n\nThe bottom line to this trade is that it is essentially a salary dump that gave the Wizards nearly $15 million in salary cap relief for the 2010-11 season. The deal also provided nearly $2.5 million in cap relief during the 2009-10 season for the Wizards, who shipped out about $19.7 million in salaries while getting back $17.3 million. Coupled with the savings they already received after the season-ending suspensions of Arenas and Crittenton, the Wizards’ luxury-tax penalty was reduced by nearly $7 million.\n\nRoss was the only player the Wizards receive who was signed through next season. His salary for the 2009-10 season was $1 million with a player option for $1.1 mil for the 2010-11 season.\n\nJosh Howard had a team option worth $11.8 million for the next season which was a foregone conclusion as far as the option being declined. He had his 2009-10 season salary at $10.9 million as well. Drew Gooden had $4.5 million expiring contract and James Singleton had a $1 million expiring contract.\n\nIn the Mavericks case, Caron Butler was making $9.8 million during the ‘09-'10 season and was owed $10.5 million for the '10-'11 season. Brendan Haywood had a $6 million expiring contract and DeShawn Stevenson had a $3.8 million salary for the 2009-10 season with a player option for $4.1 million for the next year. The Wizards received a $6 million trade exception from the trade due to Haywood’s salary being included.\n\nCaron Butler was originally acquired by the Wizards from the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-player deal that involved Kwame Brown going in the other direction. After initially playing the role of sixth man, Butler became a starter and flourished. He made two consecutive All-Star appearances in '07 and '08 and had established himself as a multi-faceted player.\n\nButler had a nice midrange game, was a good secondary ballhandler, and a solid distributor during his time with the Wizards. Butler along with Gilbert Arenas and Antawn Jamison formed one of the top scoring trios in the league, but never found a way to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in a playoff series in three tries. The Wizards always were a top-half offensive team during the peak years of the big three in Washington, but the team’s defense was always in the bottom five of the NBA.\n\nHe averaged 19.0 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 3.5 APG, and 1.8 SPG while shooting 45% from the field, 31% from the three-point line, and 87% from the free-throw line in 310 games and four and a half seasons with Washington.\n\nBrendan Haywood was originally drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was traded twice in a two month span before ending up in Washington where he would end up spending the majority of his career. After eight and a half seasons in Washington, Haywood finished with averages of 7.7 PPG, 6.3 RPG, and 1.5 BPG, while shooting 53% from the field and 62% from the foul line. Haywood is still top ten all-time in rebounds and blocks in Wizards franchise history.\n\nDeShawn Stevenson originally signed a free agent deal with the Washington Wizards in the summer of '06. He became the starting two guard and had some of his best years in the role of floor spacer and perimeter defender. He complemented the Wizards trio of scorers with those skills and had some success in Washington. He’s probably best known for feuding with LeBron James during Washington’s 2008 Playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nStevenson left Washington with averages of 9.0 PPG, 2.5 RPG, and 2.6 APG. He finished with splits of 40/35/72 from the field, three-point line, and free-throw line.\n\nDrew Gooden signed a one-year deal with the Dallas Mavericks after spending time with Chicago, Sacramento, and San Antonio during the 2008-09 season. Gooden was solid in his half-season with Dallas. He posted averages of 8.9 PPG, 6.9 RPG, and 1.1 BPG in 46 games (11 starts). Before the trade, Gooden was shooting 47% on FGs and 81% on FTs.\n\nJames Singleton signed a free agent deal with the Mavericks in the summer of 2008 after spending the previous season in Spain. Before the trade, Singleton averaged 4.3 PPG and 3.5 RPG in 87 games and 6 starts with Dallas. The forward shot 49% from the field and 87% from the free-throw line with Dallas.\n\nQuinton Ross was signed to a multi-year contract by Dallas prior to the 2009-10 season. He spent his Dallas tenure in a limited role. Ross finished with averages of 2.0 PPG and 1.0 RPG in 27 games (7 starts) with Dallas.\n\nSoon after this deal went down, the Mavericks began a winning streak that lasted 13 games and 25 days. The streak initially had critics thinking the additions of Butler, Haywood, and Stevenson could turn the team into contenders. Unfortunately for Dallas, they had the wrong matchup in the first round. The #2-seeded Mavericks met the #7-seeded Spurs and were upset 4-2.\n\nThe season after that, Dallas stockpiled even more talent with the addition of center Tyson Chandler. The Mavericks put together an even stronger 57-25 record and won a championship with Caron Butler sidelined by a ruptured patellar tendon that he suffered earlier in the season. Haywood and Stevenson were both supporting bench players who played solid roles that season. Stevenson started three games for Dallas in the Finals before the team chose to start J.J. Barea for the last three games of Dallas’ 4-2 series win over Miami.\n\nButler established himself as a second scoring option to Dirk Nowitzki. Butler was solid, but went through a decline of sorts in production while with Dallas. He suffered the previously mentioned ruptured patellar tendon during the middle of the 2010-11 season and missed the rest of the season.\n\nButler ended up leaving the Dallas Mavericks for the Los Angeles Clippers shortly after the lockout ended. He signed a three-year $24 million deal with the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency. He finished his tenure in Dallas with averages of 15.1 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 1.7 APG, and 1.4 SPG in 56 career games with Dallas. Butler also shot 44% from the field, 39% beyond the arc, and 77% from the charity stripe.\n\nHaywood’s role in Dallas fluctuated. He was a starter initially after the trade. He even re-signed with Dallas for a luxurious six years, and $55 million. Unfortunately for Haywood, Dallas acquired center Tyson Chandler from the Bobcats and Haywood was relegated to the bench.\n\nHaywood was waived by the Dallas Mavericks with the amnesty clause after the 2011-12 season and was subsequently claimed by the Charlotte Bobcats. He averaged 5.4 PPG, 5.9 RPG, and 1.2 BPG in 154 games with Dallas and shot 55% from the field and 44% from the charity stripe.\n\nStevenson played a minor role in Dallas during his time there. He was a solid defensive option off the bench for the team but struggled with his shot mightily throughout his time in Dallas. He went on to sign with the New Jersey Nets after his contract expired in 2011. The Fresno, California product left Dallas with averages of 4.5 PPG, 1.4 RPG, and 0.9 APG, while shooting 37% from the field and beyond the arc. He also shot 75% from the foul line in 96 games (59 starts).\n\nThe Wizards continued to fall apart with a 9-23 record to finish out the rest of the season with a 26-56 record which did help put them in position to draft point guard John Wall with the first pick of the 2010 NBA draft.\n\nDrew Gooden was traded once again by the Wizards just four days later to the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal also involving the Cleveland Cavaliers. Gooden never played a game in a Wizards uniform.\n\nHoward struggled to get on the court for the Wizards after the trade. He played just four games after the trade before tearing his ACL. After re-signing with the team during the 2010 offseason, he only played in 18 games during the following season due to knee tendinitis complications.\n\nThe Wake Forest product moved on and signed with the Utah Jazz after the NBA lockout. He finished his brief Wizards tenure with 9.5 PPG, 4.0 RPG, and 1.3 APG in just 22 games (13 starts) with the Wizards.\n\nSingleton and Ross both finished out the rest of the 2009-10 season with the Wizards.\n\nSingleton averaged 6.1 PPG and 6.9 RPG in 32 games (3 starts) while shooting 38% from the field and 84% from the charity stripe. The forward passed up on a minimum-level deal from the Wizards (among other teams) and chose to play in China for the 2011-12 season.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Singleton would end up rejoining the Wizards for a cup of coffee late in the 2011-12 season on a ten day contract. The Wizards ended up signing Singleton for the rest of the season.\n\nRoss averaged 1.5 PPG, in 25 games and 10.4 MPG before being traded in late June of 2010 to the New Jersey Nets for Yi Jianlian.\n\nCaron Butler Official Statement after trade (via Washington Post):\n\n“I have had a great four and a half years with the Wizards and will only have the best memories. I just want to thank the organization, the city and most importantly, the fans for embracing me and my family the way they did while we were here. I am looking forward to my new opportunity with the Mavericks and will continue to play with the same desire and intensity that I have had throughout my entire NBA career.”\n\nReflecting on the Gilbert Arenas-Javaris Crittenton Incident (via Washington Post):\n\n“I knew it was over that day.”\n\nOn how he expected the trade to happen:\n\n“I think that was a long time coming. I just think it was going to eventually happen. It was a team where the expectations were severely high and we obviously underachieved. It just didn’t work out right. It’s nobody’s fault.”\n\nOn being upset that he wasn’t offered a contract extension by the Wizards:\n\n“I wasn’t upset about it, but I worked my tail off the last couple of years when Gilbert was injured. Obviously, he’s the cornerstone and the franchise guy for that organization, you know, without a doubt. He’ll go down as one of the best players to ever play the game if he comes back [healthy]. But when he was out, you’ve got to give credit where credit was due. I was at the helm, helping lead that ballclub to the playoffs and things of that nature. I obviously got injured and wasn’t able to make the push at the butt end of the seasons. But that was me and Antawn, being the leaders and controlling the atmosphere and everything around there. You should be compensated and rewarded. I understand it’s a business, you put it aside and get prepared for the season but it was tough. You expect certain things.”\n\nOn the environment in Washington:\n\n“You had a certain way we was used to playing for a couple of years. Then you had your franchise guy, a guy you needed to be everything he needed to be, coming back, trying to prove a point, show that he was back in a major way. It was just like everybody was on different pages. We was trying to pull it together and frustration and adversity reveals character and you had people speaking out of turn. Basically, it was chaos over there. Now, looking back at it. That was a crazy situation. That was a crazy environment to come to play basketball and keep your head and keep your morale up. Being a guy that’s an emotional force on the court and off the court, that was real frustrating and once [Abe] Pollin passed away, it was open season. I was like, all right, anything can happen.”\n\nOn how the season fell apart:\n\n“We was trying to force players to be certain things instead of coming in and letting players be who they are and adapting to the players, not making players adapt to a new scheme. It was just tough.”\n\nOn coach Flip Saunders:\n\n“Flip is a great person and he’s a good coach. I think Flip was trying. I don’t know what he was really doing, but I know he had good intentions. I just think things could’ve been managed better and maybe it could’ve worked out. Flip’s not a confrontational guy. He just tried to do the right thing. I respect him. I respect everybody on the coaching staff. It just ended up not working.”\n\nOn his relationship with Gilbert Arenas:\n\n“We had a great relationship, and wherever it went wrong, for that brief moment, we still have a strong alliance. It’s all love. I wish him the best. I don’t got no grudges or vendettas toward anybody. It’s just frustrating to think about what we could’ve been for so many years. We all are still in the prime of our careers and we’re young, so it’s frustrating and now we have to deal with this and take this while you have the opportunity. I still text Gilbert. I talk to Gilbert and I was one of his biggest supporters going down the stretch, telling him to keep his head up.”\n\nOn his fond feelings for Washington:\n\n“Home is where the heart is. There is still a lot of love for D.C.”\n\nOn the professionalism in Dallas (via Washington Post):\n\n“You’ve got a great veteran group that does a good job of policing the locker room. Doing a good job of making sure everything is kosher around here. It’s a great atmosphere for basketball. Great workplace. No outside distractions. Just coming in and playing basketball.”\n\nOn leaving his home in Washington:\n\n“They could’ve just sent me anywhere, but obviously, Mr. Pollin was still working and it’s a blessing. The Pollin family really took care of me. But, you know, Washington was really home for me. Coming to a new city and having to invent yourself all over again, it’s mind-boggling to think about that on the fly, but at the same time I understand the nature of the business. Players get recycled in this game all the time.”\n\nBrendan Haywood on the pressure and heightened expectations of playing in Dallas (via Washington Post):\n\n“In D.C., even when we made it to the playoffs, we were never really taken seriously. Everybody thought, 'They maybe might win a first-round series.’ But a lot of people didn’t think we’d win that. This is a different animal. At the same time, I wouldn’t have it any other way. As you get older, you realize the playoffs aren’t a given. Competing for a championship isn’t a given. And basketball, it seems like it takes a while, but it’s a very short career. I’m just grateful for every playoff game I can play.”\n\nOn always having to battle for the starting center position:\n\n“It’s a situation I’ve been in before in D.C. So I’ve been in situations where I’ve been a starter. I’ve been in situations where I have to come off the bench. I feel I can contribute in both aspects. You may like one more than the other, but it doesn’t change your approach or how hard you go out there and play.”\n\nOn the situation in Dallas (via Washington Post):\n\n“Basketball life was great in Dallas. It was a great group of guys, everybody was on one accord, we were working toward one goal. Things were just done right from the top all the way down to the bottom, and you couldn’t have asked for a better situation.”\n\nOn the differences between Dallas and Washington:\n\n“Um, yeah, it was very obvious. It was very obvious. They had established the way things were done around there, and you were forced to basically adhere to a certain standard. We came from D.C., and that wasn’t always enforced. In Dallas, it was something totally different, and we liked it. Just look at the structure, how things were done, the no-nonsense attitude and just how everybody got along and the family atmosphere. There was no agendas. That was something totally different for us.”\n\nOn the Gilbert Arenas situation:\n\n“See, it’s different, because I like him as a person. Gilbert’s a friend of mine, so I would be biased. From a business aspect I would have to look at it, do the fans want him back? Has he offended a lot of people? I don’t know. For me, I’d want him back, because he’s a friend of mine, but from a business aspect I’m not sure how I’d look at it.”\n\nJosh Howard on feeling it was time to move on (via Washington Post):\n\n“Sometimes you outgrow things and it’s time to move on. The Mavs are trying to make a push. I know it wasn’t my fault that I got traded. I did everything I could in my ability to help them win. I guess it was time to part ways.”\n\nOn his experiences in Dallas:\n\n“Dallas is a great organization, taught me a lot. Being able to go to the playoffs all my years was a blessing, but what I learned down there, I’ll bring up here and hopefully make a positive turnaround. It was a good thing to be spoiled by the Mavs, being able to make it to the playoffs, but we can make a strong push to get that eighth spot or even the seventh spot. I’m coming here with a positive attitude, trying to play hard and get us to the playoffs.”\n\nDrew Gooden on getting traded once again (via Washington Post):\n\n“This is not my first rodeo getting traded. We’ll see what happens. I’m a Washington Wizard, but we’ll see what happens.”\n\nOn being surprised:\n\n“I was caught by surprise. Things started to slide downhill over there and you knew something was going to happen, but for what I provided for that team, I didn’t think it would be me, but it’s the business. ”\n\nOn the transition:\n\n“It won’t be tough for me. Transition to another team, I’m used to it. I’ve been to San Antonio, Cleveland, Sacramento for a game, Dallas, Chicago, D.C., the last 12 months it seems like. The transition won’t be hard at all.”\n\nOn his beard:\n\n“I thought I was moving to the sun, in Dallas. Now I’m back in the cold. I guess I’ll have to grow one back out.”\n\nWashington Wizards president of basketball operations Ernie Grunfeld (via Washington Post):\n\n“We haven’t achieved the things that we were hoping to,. We just felt like we need some change and we needed some freshness. Maybe this group together has gotten a little bit stale. Maybe we needed to go in another direction at this time.”\n\nOn what the Wizards received in the trade:\n\n“We’re getting some quality players here. Josh Howard was an all-star a few years ago and Drew Gooden was a starter for a team that went to the NBA Finals. We get some very solid players, players who are going to come in and give us some freshness. At the same time it does give us more flexibility down the road.”\n\nOn expectations for the season:\n\n“We all thought this would be a much more productive season for us, but a lot of things happened along the way. Players always tell you what to do and if you are not winning as you would like to win, sometimes it’s necessary to make some changes.”\n\nOn Brendan Haywood’s impending free agency:\n\n“He’s one of the better big men out there. So I think there is going to be a lot of demand for him in the offseason.”\n\nOn the trade being necessary (via Washington Post):\n\n“It was time to make some changes. A lot of things happened that were out of our hands, out of control, but the bottom line is, this is the NBA and you want to win and you want to put the best group out there. And I don’t think this group was meshing very well. We played selfish basketball and we didn’t win as much as we’d like to win.”\n\nOn the players the team traded (via Inside Hoops):\n\n“Caron, Brendan and DeShawn all made significant contributions to this franchise and this community, but this was an opportunity we did not want to pass up. We wish all three players the best and thank them for what they helped us accomplish during their tenures with the Wizards.”\n\nOn the players the Wizards acquired:\n\n“Our four new players bring versatility and the experience of playing in a winning situation. Josh and Quinton can each play both the shooting guard and small forward positions while providing athleticism and outside shooting. Drew can play both the power forward and center positions and he and James give us an inside presence that combines skill and toughness.”\n\nDallas Mavericks president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson (via ESPN):\n\n“We are more than excited to welcome Caron, Brendan and DeShawn to the Mavericks family. Caron is an established professional and an All-Star with the ability to score from anywhere on the floor. Brendan will solidify our center position with athleticism, shot-blocking and defense. DeShawn has also shown that he can be a talented asset to this team.”\n\nOn the players Dallas dealt (via Mavs Blog):\n\n“We would like to thank these four players for their valuable contributions. It is especially difficult to part with Josh. He began his career as a Maverick and we have watched him grow. We appreciate what Josh has helped this franchise accomplish.”\n\nOn Josh Howard specifically (via Pegasus News):\n\n“Josh was a very, very difficult decision. Here’s a guy that started his career with the Mavericks, was a huge part of our success and took us to the Finals. We’re going to miss him both on and off the floor.”\n\nOn what Caron Butler can bring:\n\n“You’re looking at a guy like Caron Butler that can give us an offensive push. He’s been around the block, two-time All-Star, knows what it takes to win at the highest level, has the experience – that was a factor. Caron is probably more of a conventional fit for us.”\n\nMark Cuban on the trade (via ESPN):\n\n“It makes us significantly better.”\n\nOn making the trade (via NY TImes):\n\n“The goal is to win a championship, not to make the playoffs. I had an approach that I thought could work. Fortunately, we were able to complete the trade we did instead.”\n\nOn Josh Howard:\n\n“Different teams go through different situations. The Mavs went through it in the '90s, the Wizards are going through some issues right now. Sometimes giving guys a fresh home I think re-energizes them, and will work the other way, too. I think Josh will find himself re-energized with the Wizards.”\n\nOn Drew Gooden (via ESPN Dallas):\n\n“Drew did a great job. He laid it out there every game for us to try to fill in as a 5. Going into the season we thought that would work and it just didn’t play out as planned.”\n\nOn Brendan Haywood (via Pegasus News):\n\n“We think (Haywood) can really help us get to a level where we can put Damp and him in there, in some cases, matching up against two bigs. He can run and he can finish…He’s not a go-to scorer, but he’s certainly someone that can anchor our defense.”\n\nMavericks head coach Rick Carlisle on the change in the Mavericks after the trade (via NY TImes):\n\n“We’re tougher, top to bottom now. Tougher physically, a little bit mentally tougher team, just because of the makeup of these guys. No disrespect to any of the guys who were here. It’s just given us sort of a different personality.”\n\nOn owner Mark Cuban planning on blowing up the team:\n\n“I knew that he was considering blowing it up, but those decisions are his, because he’s the owner. I’m glad things went the way they did.”\n\nWizards head coach Flip Saunders on Drew Gooden (via Washington Post):\n\n“We had a good talk about things. We’ll see where things are. It’s always tough when you’re traded. He’s been a guy that’s been traded a lot at the trading deadline so I think he had some concerns. I hope my talk to him, and Ernie talked to him, I hope he understands why we wanted him involved in the deal and that things will work out.”\n\nMavericks guard Jason Kidd (via ESPN):\n\n“It gives us a chance to win. When you’re talking about Caron, Haywood and DeShawn Stevenson, you have three quality players. The West is strong. This hopefully gives us a chance to compete against [the Lakers] and Denver.”\n\nMavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki on the trade (via NY TImes):\n\n“Actually, I think we’re better. We’re more talented, we’re deeper.”\n\nOn the team making tough decisions (via Pegasus News):\n\n“Sometimes you have to make some tough decisions. It’s always tough and sad to see a teammate leave, especially when you’ve played with him for a long time…Sometimes the franchise moves on and makes tough decisions, and that was one of them.”\n\nMavericks guard Jason Terry (via NY TImes):\n\n“No question. I don’t think there’s any question in this locker room and around the league, the perception of us right now is we’re a contender.”\n\nOn needing to make changes due to a feeling that the team was accepting losing:\n\n“I thought for about a month and a half, we kind of accepted it. And anytime that starts to creep into your team, there has to be a change.”\n\nLakers guard Kobe Bryant on the trade (via Dallas-Observer):\n\n“You’re going to love Caron. He’s tough as nails. Makes Dallas a better team. Competition in the West just got tougher.”\n\nTNT Analyst Charles Barkley on the trade (via Dallas Morning News):\n\n“It’s a great trade for the Mavericks. They’re going to be happy with Caron Butler. He’s going to be really good with Jason Kidd.”\n\nNBA TV Analyst Steve Smith on the trade (via Dallas Morning News):\n\n“They weren’t going anywhere the way they were. It’s going to make them better. Butler needed to get out of Washington.”"
