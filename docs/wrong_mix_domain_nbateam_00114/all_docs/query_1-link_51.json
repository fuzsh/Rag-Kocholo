        "text": "Matt JonesAnalyst I\n\n50 Most Worthless Players in the NBA\n\n0 of 50\n\nSo maybe worthless is a bit harsh. Every player has some value no matter how bad they are or how little they contribute on the court.\n\nSome guys may be a good locker room leader, a good cheerleader from the side or just be there to practice against the team's All-Star.\n\nWhatever the reason for these guys hanging around the league, it is not always obvious, and fans are often frustrated with what they see each night.\n\nThe following list is of players whose value is not as apparent as others and who are not exactly setting the NBA on fire with their on-court statistics.\n\nSome of these players are new to the league and still fighting for playing time, some are not living up to big contracts that they signed several seasons ago and some are simply past their prime and trying to hold on to their careers as long as they possibly can.\n\nUnfortunately, some have suffered injuries that have altered their careers and have decreased their value significantly.\n\nNot that I could play any better and not to take anything away from the hard work these guys have put in, but these are the players we are often not sure why they have a job in the NBA.\n\nPlayers are not ranked and are in no particular order.\n\nDeSagana Diop, Charlotte Bobcats\n\n1 of 50\n\nDeSagana Diop is a big man who is just there to take up space.\n\nNever once in more than his 10-year career has he averaged more than three points or 5.5 rebounds per game.\n\nIn his 12.3 minutes this season, he is putting in 1.1 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.\n\nHe also struggles from the free-throw line, where he recently threw up one of the worst missed free throws in NBA history.\n\nKwame Brown, Golden State Warriors\n\n2 of 50\n\nThe horrible history of Kwame Brown is well known, and we don't need to get into how he failed to meet expectations when he was the first pick of the 2001 NBA draft.\n\nHe has a 6.8 point-per-game career average to go along with only 5.8 rebounds.\n\nTo make matters worse, he is currently out for several months with an injury.\n\nDespite being one of the worst players in the league, he is making $7 million this season in Golden State.\n\nDeMarre Carroll, Denver Nuggets\n\n3 of 50\n\nDeMarre Carroll signed a free-agent contract with the Denver Nuggets despite playing only 12 games last season.\n\nHe has a career average of 2.7 points and 1.9 rebounds per game.\n\nHe is a bit more of a defensive player, but only played 15 total minutes in three games this season due to an injury.\n\nLazar Hayward, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n4 of 50\n\nLazar Hayward is in his second year in the league and has already been traded twice since being drafted as the last pick of the first round in 2010.\n\nLast season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, he averaged 3.8 points and 1.7 rebounds per game. This year, his numbers have dropped, as he struggles to get onto the court for the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nTravis Outlaw, Sacramento Kings\n\n5 of 50\n\nTravis Outlaw had some good moments and seasons in his career, but he is not doing anything this year.\n\nOutlaw signed with the Sacramento Kings after the New Jersey Nets used their amnesty clause to get rid of him and his outrageous contract.\n\nLife is not good for Outlaw in Sacramento, where he is using his nearly 12 minutes per game to score only 3.1 points per contest.\n\nChris Duhon, Orlando Magic\n\n6 of 50\n\nChris Duhon has not exactly set the NBA on fire in his first seven seasons, and this year is one of his worst so far.\n\nHe did have a good year as the starter on a bad New York Knicks team, but he is nowhere near that player now.\n\nAs the backup for the Orlando Magic, he is averaging 3.2 points and 2.5 assists per game.\n\nDuhon did have a 14-point night in only his second start of the season, but this type of performance is not common for him this year.\n\nBrian Cook, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n7 of 50\n\nIn his ninth year in the NBA, Brian Cook has missed several games for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nAs a reserve big man, Cook has career averages of 5.7 points and 2.7 rebounds in less than 14 minutes per game.\n\nCook has spent a lot of time on the bench during his career.\n\nRashard Lewis, Washington Wizards\n\n8 of 50\n\nRashard Lewis was one of the NBA's brightest stars early in his career, but he gave up on the Orlando Magic a couple of years after signing a huge contract.\n\nHis scoring average of 8.4 points per game this season is about half of his career average, and he has not lived up to the expectations he had when he signed for so much money.\n\nLewis is second only to Kobe Bryant in terms of total salary that he will earn this season, with a paycheck of over $22 million.\n\nSteve Novak, New York Knicks\n\n9 of 50\n\nI am not sure exactly what Steve Novak's role on the New York Knicks is, but it is obviously not to score points and grab rebounds.\n\nNovak has a career average of four points and 1.1 rebounds per game.\n\nHe will play a little more now due to his teammates being out with injury, but he may only be good for dishing out his six fouls every night.\n\nJon Brockman, Milwaukee Bucks\n\n10 of 50\n\nJon Brockman went from bad to worse when he was traded from the Sacramento Kings to the Milwaukee Bucks before the 2010-2011 season began.\n\nBrockman, who is still developing as an NBA player, scores only 2.3 points and grabs just 3.4 rebounds per game.\n\nWith Andrew Bogut going down with another injury, Brockman may get some more playing time but is not the player that Bucks fans can count on to help solve the problem.\n\nTony Battie, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n11 of 50\n\nTony Battie has found a way to hang around the league since 1997, but this season is by far his worst.\n\nNow on his sixth team, Battie is not anywhere near the player he was when he started all 82 games for the Orlando Magic a few years back.\n\nBattie is not coming off the bench as often as he would like in Philadelphia and is only averaging 1.7 points and 2.5 rebounds per game.\n\nIt looks like his 14th season in the NBA could be his last.\n\nSemih Erden, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n12 of 50\n\nSemih Erden was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the last pick of the 2008 NBA draft. He was later traded with his current teammate Luke Harangody for a future second-round pick.\n\nErden, the seven footer from Turkey, is a big man who does little more than take up space in the paint.\n\nIt is not a good sign when a center has an average of only 2.1 rebounds per game. He is only adding 3.4 points per game this year as well.\n\nTo make matters worse, Erden has fallen out of the rotation in Cleveland recently, as he did not play in a game last week due to a coach's decision.\n\nJamaal Magloire, Toronto Raptors\n\n13 of 50\n\nJamaal Magloire has played in the NBA 11 seasons, but he is past his prime in Toronto this year.\n\nMagloire's production has been on the decline for several seasons, but this is the worst of his career. He is scoring only 0.9 points per game for the Raptors and does not play much.\n\nDespite his long career, Magloire is going to have a hard time signing a new contract next summer when his current deal expires.\n\nJohan Petro, New Jersey Nets\n\n14 of 50\n\nThe New Jersey Nets are not a good team, and Johan Petro is not helping that much.\n\nPetro, who averages 4.2 points and 2.8 rebounds per game this year, has started a few games for the Nets, but he cannot get anything going this season.\n\nOverall, the Nets are not a good team in the low post, and the 7' Petro is part of that equation.\n\nJared Jeffries, New York Knicks\n\n15 of 50\n\nSince becoming the 11th overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft, Jared Jeffries has not been much more than a disappointment.\n\nIt is not good for a 6'11\" forward to have career averages of only five points and 4.2 rebounds per game.\n\nSince rejoining the New York Knicks last season after some time with the Houston Rockets, Jeffries' game has actually gotten worse since the first time he was in New York.\n\nKosta Koufos, Denver Nuggets\n\n16 of 50\n\nKosta Koufos should have stayed in college instead of coming out and being drafted by the Utah Jazz.\n\nAfter a couple of less than stellar seasons with the Jazz, Koufos has taken his game to Minnesota and to Denver, where he continues to underperform with the Nuggets.\n\nKoufos has career averages of 3.3 points and 2.5 rebounds per game.\n\nHe often looks lost on the court and seems surprised when one of his shots goes in the basket.\n\nHamed Haddadi, Memphis Grizzlies\n\n17 of 50\n\nIranian born Hamed Haddadi was an undrafted free agent who signed with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2008.\n\nSince that time, the 7'2\" Haddadi has struggled to play in the NBA and has a career average of only 6.2 minutes played per game.\n\nHaddadi is having his best season this year by averaging 2.6 points and three rebounds per game.\n\nHe posted better numbers in 18 games in the Developmental League, but even there he did not do well.\n\nDespite his lack of production, Haddadi will stay in the league for several years based on his size.\n\nGreg Oden, Portland Trailblazers\n\n18 of 50\n\nDue only to injuries, Oden has not yet had the opportunity to show why he was the first overall draft choice ahead of Kevin Durant in the 2007 draft.\n\nCalling Oden worthless is unfair, but he has not been able to reach any of his potential and has seen his value drop considerably.\n\nHe has played in only 82 games during his entire career.\n\nCredit should be given to the Portland Trail Blazers, who still hold out hope that Oden can some day overcome his injuries and are loyal to Oden.\n\nHasheem Thabeet, Houston Rockets\n\n19 of 50\n\nHasheem Thabeet is the worst draft pick the Memphis Grizzlies ever made, and he has never lived up to being the second overall pick in 2009.\n\nThabeet was supposed to use his 7'3\" height to be a shot-blocker and a dominant center in the NBA.\n\nThat still has yet to pan out.\n\nThabeet has spent time in the Developmental League and has career averages of 2.2 points and 2.7 rebounds per game.\n\nHe has only played in four games this year for the Houston Rockets.\n\nYi Jianlian, Dallas Mavericks\n\n20 of 50\n\nYi Jianlian has seen an increase in playing time with the injury to Dirk Nowitzki, but he has not improved much with the additional time.\n\nYi was supposed to solve all of the Milwaukee Bucks' problems when they selected him with the sixth overall pick in 2007.\n\nInstead, he is now on his fourth team and has the lowest averages of his career. Through six games with the Dallas Mavericks, Jianlian is scoring four points per game with only 2.7 rebounds.\n\nTo say that he was a draft bust is an understatement.\n\nDarko Milicic, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n21 of 50\n\nLike Kwame Brown, the story of Darko Milicic and his disappointing career is well known.\n\nDrafted in 2003 in front of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade, Milicic has done nothing in his eight years in the NBA.\n\nHe is now playing for his fifth team and has a career average of 6.1 points and 4.3 rebounds per game.\n\nJamaal Tinsley, Utah Jazz\n\n22 of 50\n\nJamaal Tinsley was once a solid starting point guard who led the Indiana Pacers into the playoffs.\n\nNow he is stuck as the third point guard for the Utah Jazz who sees very little time on the court. Before coming to Utah, Tinsley was playing in the Developmental League for the Los Angeles D-Fenders.\n\nTinsley jumped at the chance to play in Utah, where he can mentor the younger players, but with only 4.8 minutes per game, it is unlikely that he is going to do much more.\n\nSebastian Telfair, Phoenix Suns\n\n23 of 50\n\nSebastian Telfair did not get a fair shake when he came into the league in 2004.\n\nExpected to be one of the top point guards in the NBA despite skipping college, Telfair has struggled his entire career to find the type of play he was supposed to provide.\n\nTelfair has not been a consistent starter throughout his career and has not started for the Phoenix Suns this season.\n\nPlaying behind Steve Nash, he is averaging only 4.4 points and 0.9 assists per game this season.\n\nJason Collins, Atlanta Hawks\n\n24 of 50\n\nIt is hard to say which of the twin brothers, Jason or Jarron Collins, had a worse career.\n\nJason, who is still in the league playing for the Atlanta Hawks, has averaged only 3.9 points and 0.9 rebounds per game over his career.\n\nHis brother Jarron averaged 3.9 points and four rebounds for his career.\n\nRegardless of which brother was better, neither was very good and both should be out of the league.\n\nVladimir Radmanovic, Atlanta Hawks\n\n25 of 50\n\nSince leaving the Los Angeles Lakers, Vladimir Radmanovic has fallen off of the NBA radar. Playing for the Charlotte Bobcats and Golden State Warriors has not helped him out.\n\nNow with the Atlanta Hawks, Radmanovic is averaging six points per game as an oversized three-point shooter.\n\nRenaldo Balkman, New York Knicks\n\n26 of 50\n\nDuring his eight-plus years in the league, Renaldo Balkman has not done anything special.\n\nHe is currently on his second go-around with the New York Knicks, but he is playing worse than the first time.\n\nOver his career, he averaged 4.1 points per game and 3.5 rebounds.\n\nHis numbers the season are down from that, as he is not getting much playing time.\n\nSundiata Gaines, New Jersey Nets\n\n27 of 50\n\nSundiata Gaines is best known for hitting a game-winning three-point shot to beat LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers a couple of seasons ago.\n\nGaines, who spent some time in the Developmental League before signing 10-day contracts in Utah, is having his best season this year, but his career has been inconsistent.\n\nHis career numbers are 4.5 points and 1.6 assists per game.\n\nShelden Williams, New Jersey Nets\n\n28 of 50\n\nShelden Williams is not even the best basketball player in his own home, let alone on the New Jersey Nets or in the NBA.\n\nNicknamed the Landlord, Williams has had a rough career that has seen him average only 4.5 points and 4.1 rebounds per game.\n\nHe has played for seven NBA teams since the Atlanta Hawks wasted the fifth overall pick on him in 2006.\n\nRoger Mason Jr., Wasington Wizards\n\n29 of 50\n\nRoger Mason Jr. did have some good seasons with the San Antonio Spurs, but he has done very little since that time.\n\nMason signed as a free agent with the Washington Wizards before the season began. He has been as disappointing as the Washington Wizards have been this year by averaging only 1.9 points per game this season.\n\nEduardo Najera, Charlotte Bobcats\n\n30 of 50\n\nAfter leaving the Dallas Mavericks, Eduardo Najera has become a forgotten player in the NBA.\n\nWith a five-point per game career average, Najera never posted good numbers but was known as a hustle player.\n\nNow playing for the Charlotte Bobcats, no one is sure what he is known as.\n\nNajera has only appeared in five games this season for the Bobcats.\n\nDamien Wilkins, Detroit Pistons\n\n31 of 50\n\nThe son and nephew of two former NBA players, Damien Wilkins looked like he was putting together a nice career in Seattle, but was never the same when the team moved to Oklahoma City.\n\nNot known as a starter, Wilkins is playing nearly 18 minutes per game for the Detroit Pistons this season off the bench.\n\nHe is only averaging 3.3 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in that time.\n\nSolomon Alabi, Toronto Raptors\n\n32 of 50\n\nSolomon Alabi is only in his second year in the league, but he is not ready for life in the NBA.\n\nHe has bounced back and forth several times between the Toronto Raptors and the Developmental League.\n\nHe was recently recalled from the Bakersfield Jam, but is not expected to help the Raptors out much.\n\nBetween last season and this year, he has appeared in 13 NBA games and has scored a grand total of six points.\n\nLuke Harangody, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n33 of 50\n\nLuke Harangody was a very late second-round pick of the Boston Celtics, who have since traded him away.\n\nAlthough he is currently on the injured list, he has not had much to talk about.\n\nHe did play better with the Cleveland Cavaliers after the trade last season, but he is still learning how to manage the NBA game.\n\nHis has career numbers of 3.8 points and 2.8 rebounds per game.\n\nSasha Pavlovic, Boston Celtics\n\n34 of 50\n\nSasha Pavlovic is one of those players who has a hard time finding an home in the NBA.\n\nHe has played for five different teams after being taken from Utah by the Charlotte Bobcats in the expansion draft of 2004.\n\nPavlovic is another player who never met his expectations but has found a way to stay in the league.\n\nHe averages 2.8 points per game for the Boston Celtics this season.\n\nJerry Stackhouse, Atlanta Hawks\n\n35 of 50\n\nJerry Stackhouse does not belong on this list for his entire career, but he is a player who is past his prime and needs to hang up the sneakers.\n\nOnce known as one of the most exciting players in the league, this former All-Star has lost a lot in his 17th season in the league.\n\nHe is well below his career averages, with only three points and 0.9 rebounds per game this season in seven games.\n\nIt is time for him to call it an end to a good career.\n\nBrian Cardinal, Dallas Mavericks\n\n36 of 50\n\nBrian Cardinal has been around the league since 2000 and has always found a way to make a roster.\n\nHe does have a championship ring that he earned with the Dallas Mavericks last season, but that does not make him a good player.\n\nHe has career numbers of 4.9 points and 2.4 total rebounds per game.\n\nSupporters of Cardinal would argue that the things he does to help the team win do not show up in the box score.\n\nSolomon Jones, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n37 of 50\n\nSolomon Jones of the Los Angeles Clippers is the classic example of a big man that will find a team for several years due only to his size.\n\nIn his six seasons, Jones has played for three different teams but never averaged more than four points per game.\n\nThis year, he has appeared in seven games for the Clippers and has a total of six points, 13 rebounds and nine personal fouls on the season.\n\nDevin Ebanks, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n38 of 50\n\nDevin Ebanks is a young player who is part of an extremely underperforming bench for the Los Angeles Lakers this season.\n\nEbanks was not expected to do much in the NBA, and he hasn't. He has a career scoring average of 2.9 points per game over 31 games.\n\nHe has spent some time in the Developmental League, but he is not getting enough time to really develop into a solid player.\n\nEddie Curry, Miami Heat\n\n39 of 50\n\nEddie Curry deserves a lot of credit for overcoming off-court tragedies and working his way back to the NBA, but the Miami Heat experiment is not yet working out.\n\nHe has appeared in three games this season and has six points and four rebounds total. Hopefully he will improve as he gets more playing time.\n\nCharlie Villanueva, Detroit Pistons\n\n40 of 50\n\nMatt Carroll, Charlotte Bobcats\n\n41 of 50\n\nHe did spend some time in the developmental league early in his career and has bounced around a bit from team to team.\n\nThis season, he is playing about 14 minutes for a bad Bobcats team and averaging only 4.1 points per game.\n\nSo far this year, he is 3-of-21 from three-point range for a percentage of 14 percent.\n\nFrancisco Elson, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n42 of 50\n\nFrancisco Elson recently signed with the Philadelphia 76ers and has played in two games with his new team.\n\nLast season, he came off the bench in Utah for the Jazz—something that he has been accustomed to during his career.\n\nOverall, Elson has averaged 3.7 points and 3.5 rebounds per game for his career.\n\nThat is not even that good for a guy that comes off the bench just to rest the starters.\n\nEarl Barron, Golden State Warriors\n\n43 of 50\n\nEarl Barron has been in and out of the Developmental League and has dealt with more 10-day contracts than he would like to.\n\nBarron has taken the role of a journeyman center who has played with six different teams.\n\nThis season, he is with the Golden State Warriors, where he has only played in one game.\n\nHe has career averages of 5.1 points and 3.6 rebounds per game.\n\nMichael Redd, Phoenix Suns\n\n44 of 50\n\nLike Greg Oden, Michael Redd's once very promising career was cut short way too early with knee injuries.\n\nAt one time, Redd was one of the best scorers and purest shooters in the entire league.\n\nRedd deserves recognition for his comeback attempt with the Phoenix Suns this season, but it is hard to watch him average only 3.3 points per game.\n\nHis career average is 19.8 points per game.\n\nJuwan Howard, Miami Heat\n\n45 of 50\n\nAfter 17 seasons roaming around the NBA, Juwan Howard needs to just call it a career.\n\nPlaying in Miami to win an NBA Championship before he retires, this former All-Star has seen a drop in his production over the last several seasons.\n\nThis year, he is averaging only 0.9 points per game in just 4.7 minutes on the court.\n\nLuke Walton, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n46 of 50\n\nLuke Walton is still sitting on the bench for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe has appeared in only five games this season for the team and has scored only 10 total points.\n\nWalton, who was never that good to begin with, caught the benefit of playing with Kobe Bryant to prolong his career.\n\nIt is not likely that Walton will be in the league once his contract is up at the end of next season.\n\nNikola Pekovic, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n47 of 50\n\nDespite being a late-round draft pick in 2008, Nikola Pekovic did not make it to the NBA until last season.\n\nThe 6'11\" forward is playing better this season than last, but he is going to find himself as the odd man out in Minnesota with all of the quality forwards they have on the team.\n\nPekovic has pretty good numbers at 5.7 points per game for his career, but he does not get as many rebounds at three per game as a player his size should.\n\nLarry Owens, New Jersey Nets\n\n48 of 50\n\nLarry Owens' NBA career is just getting started, but he already is at a disadvantage.\n\nOwens was recently called up from the Developmental League to play for the New Jersey Nets, who need help at the small forward position.\n\nOwens has played a total of 17 NBA games for three different teams and has career averages of 2.8 points and 1.6 rebounds per game.\n\nDespite being a young guy, let's hope he improves with the Nets and can stick around for several years.\n\nRoyal Ivey, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n49 of 50\n\nRoyal Ivey has played in the NBA for four different teams in seven years and has a hard time staying on the court.\n\nHe has averaged only 12.6 minutes and has a career scoring average of 3.5 points per game as a reserve point guard.\n\nHe has played in only three games this season for the Oklahoma City Thunder and has a total of two points and one assist on the year in 20 total minutes.\n\nBrian Scalabrine, Chicago Bulls\n\n50 of 50\n\nLast but certainly not least on this list is Brian Scalabrine, who is a player that many believe is worthless, and many believe is a good role player.\n\nI can not win either way with Scalabrine.\n\nI will hear complaints whether he is on the list or not, so I leave it up to the reader to decide whether or not he should be here.\n\nScalabrine has played for three different teams in his more than 10-year career.\n\nHe has averaged 3.1 points and two rebounds per game in 13.3 minutes overall. He was able to win an NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics and is now trying to do the same with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nRegardless of his numbers, I will leave it up to the readers to decide whether he belongs on this list or not.\n\nLeave me your thoughts and tell me what you think.\n\nFollow on Twitter @CJ_NBA\n\nX"
