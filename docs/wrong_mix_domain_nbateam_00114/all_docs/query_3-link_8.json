        "text": "It’s 2019 and a grown ass man was arrested Saturday night for weed. That man is ex-NBA player Kwame Brown … who was busted in Georgia with a bunch of marijuana … including pot-infused cookies, tea and mints. The 2001 first overall pick was a passenger in his Mercedes-Benz van when it was pulled over by Brunswick PD late Saturday night … when cops say his car REEKED of weed. Kwame copped to having weed in the car … and told law enforcement he had some in the trunk of the van. Sure enough, cops found a backpack with all the weed treats.\n\nBrunswick Police arrested Kwame Brown following a traffic stop shortly after midnight Saturday at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and I Street, charging the Glynn County Sports Hall of Fame member and former NBA player with felony possession of edible marijuana products, according to a police report.\n\nThe vehicle’s driver, Ivy Mcgeil Cash, 48, was arrested for driving without a license, the report said. As Brown was being arrested, Cash allegedly “started yelling that the bag belonged to him,” the report said. Brown then also said the marijuana products belonged to Cash, the report said. The 7-foot-tall Brown could not be transported to the county jail in a standard patrol vehicle, “and we had to wait for a larger one to transport,” the report said.\n\nBrown said in a lawsuit that his signature was forged on various authorization forms and agreements, allowing his financial adviser to make investments and stock trades without his consent. When Brown sought an accounting of his investments last year, he was told he had no monies with Merrill Lynch, according to his complaint filed Thursday in Los Angeles."
