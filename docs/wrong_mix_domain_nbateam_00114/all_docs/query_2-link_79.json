        "text": "Kwame Brown is a former NBA player who played for 12 years in 7 different teams. He used to be comfortable playing either center or as a point forward. He retired in 2013 after having played in 4 NBA finals.\n\nKwame had a decent career and after retirement also his focus has been on the NBA as he is very active about his opinions on social media. The start of Browns’ career was not as smooth as he would have liked and one reason behind that might have been Michael Jordan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAlthough there might be a lot of good things about Michael Jordan, one thing a lot of people feel about him is that the way MJ treated Kwame was not good at all. A lot of people believe that MJ might be part of the reason why Kwame never reached his actual potential.\n\nKwame Brown reveals how he dealt with bullies of the NBA\n\nKwame made his debut in the NBA in 2001. The Washington Wizards drafted him as their first overall pick. But the promise he had never fulfilled expectations.\n\nAlso read: Kwame takes his anger out on Kendrick Perkins after the latter tweeted his claims.\n\nMichael Jordan had bought 10% of the shares in Wizards while he also played there for two seasons after coming out of retirement. MJ was an influential figure in the franchise just because of who he was more than anything else.\n\nAccording to Kwame, Michael Jordan used Doug Collins to undermine the young member of the team. Kwame revealed that MJ used to make remarks at him for him to get angry and react. Kwame said that he knew better because his mother told him so. He used to discuss when it got tough and his mother used to give examples of his brother and what he has gone through in relation to his brothers’ prison time.\n\nWatch This Story: Moments when Michael Jordan was mean to Kwame and others.\n\n“I got drafted in the NBA. My brothers went to prison as teenagers. So I’m looking at it like this, it ain’t about me you know. I came through a homeless shelter and I have been through so many worse things,” said Kwame on how he maintained his cool when Michael Jordan and Doug Collins acted in a disrespectful and demeaning manner.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIt was quite impressive how Kwame, at the age of just 18, knew what they were trying to do and used to ignore it. His maturity at the time was commendable, as this still remains something of a dark mark on Michael Jordan, as many believe he stopped Kwame from progressing in his career.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHe did not get enough game time as a young rookie. Hence, he never lived up to be one of the best despite his potential.\n\nHow would Kwame have turned up if he had not faced such plights? We’ll never know but one can guess maybe he would have lived up to the expectations."
