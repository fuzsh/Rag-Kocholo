        "text": "An agreement exists between the NBA and FIBA that governs the movement of players back and forth, and so Sacramento had to wait until he was a free agent overseas and had an interest in coming to the NBA. To lure him over, they guaranteed him $13 million, with a team option for 2025-26. A guaranteed contract works both ways. Vezenkov did not have a player option for 2024-25, and so when reports surfaced that he wanted to return overseas, he couldn’t just leave; the NBA-FIBA agreement wouldn’t allow him to break a contract with his NBA team.\n\n“When I took the job you know it was a veteran laden team,” Billups said. “Melo [Anthony] was actually still on the roster. I really took the job thinking that I was going to be coaching him. You know with Dame [Lillard] and CJ [McCollum], Nurk [Nurkic]. So it was perfect for me, I’m thinking okay boom, a few moves here and there, I’m coming to like try to elevate things and then very quickly it changed.”\n\nPaul George on vibe he got for signing with Clippers: 'I'm on the B team'\n\nTomer Azarly: Paul George: “I think initially, coming back to LA that was home. But it’s not the same love. Because when I was in LA, they said, ‘you should’ve been a Laker.’ That’s all I was hearing… I’m on the B Team. That’s how the vibe and the love felt.”\n\nPaul George: 'Pressure causes a lot of injuries'\n\n“I think just taking the pressure off Joel,” George said. “I think I can kind of help him get through a season healthy. And again, it’s just not putting so much pressure on him. Regardless of how good you feel, I think pressure causes a lot of injuries as well, and you think you have to get overplayed, you have to touch every possession, that kind of just wears you down, especially for how physical he is. “So that’s the key. Everybody do their part, make sure we’re working on our bodies, and that we don’t just put that pressure on one individual to go out and win games for us.”\n\nJared Weiss: Brad Stevens’ statement on the Sam Hauser extension: “You can count on Sam. He comes to work every single day with the right mindset and attitude. His shooting gets most of the attention – but his feel for the game, defensive versatility, and his consistency as a teammate have allowed him to impact our team in the biggest of moments. We are excited Sam has decided to extend his contract with the Celtics.”"
