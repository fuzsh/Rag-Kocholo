The Dallas Mavericks announced Thursday that they have acquired center Andrew Bogut along with a future second-round pick from the Golden State Warriors in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick.

Bogut (7-0, 260) is an 11-year veteran with career averages of 10.3 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.6 blocks and 29.4 minutes per game in 644 games (630 starts) with Milwaukee and Golden State. He earned All-NBA Third Team honors with the Bucks in 2009-10 and was named NBA All-Defensive Second Team with the Warriors in 2014-15. He was also a member of the Warriorsâ€™ 2015 NBA championship team.

A native of Melbourne, Australia, Bogut was selected by Milwaukee with the first overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. He became the first Australian ever taken with the top pick. Bogut appeared in all 82 games for the Bucks in 2005-06, earning NBA All-Rookie First Team honors after finishing the season with averages of 9.4 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. He averaged a double-double in three consecutive seasons with Milwaukee from 2008-11. In 2009-10, Bogut averaged a career-high 15.9 points to go along with 10.2 rebounds per game en route to being named All-NBA Third Team.

Bogut was traded along with Stephen Jackson to the Warriors in exchange for Monta Ellis, Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh on March 13, 2012. He made his debut with the team the following season (2012-13), and the Warriors went on to reach the postseason in each of the next four years (2013-16). After winning a title with Golden State in 2014-15, Bogut helped the Warriors win an NBA-record 73 games in 2015-16 and reach the Finals for the second straight year. Bogut suffered a left knee injury in Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals and was forced to miss the remainder of the series.

Bogut played collegiately at Utah, where he was named the Naismith College Player of the Year and won the John R. Wooden Award as a sophomore in 2004-05. The 7-footer declared for the NBA Draft following his sophomore season.

Bogut has also represented the Australian National Team in international competition, including the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
