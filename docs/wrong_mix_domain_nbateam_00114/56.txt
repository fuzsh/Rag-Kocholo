 Photo Gallery: 01/18: Lakers vs. Mavericks

DALLAS – Before his team brought the Dallas Mavericks’ 13-game winning streak to a crashing end on Jan. 7, Lakers coach Phil Jackson resigned himself to having to outscore teams as long as Lamar Odom and Kwame Brown were out with injuries.

The Lakers surprised the Mavericks on that night at Staples Center, with Dallas shooting 42.2 percent. But they were unable to hold down the Mavericks on their home court Thursday night.

With Dallas owner Mark Cuban watching from his courtside seat in a “Talk nerdy to me” T-shirt, the Mavericks blew away the Lakers in the middle two quarters on the way to a 114-95 victory at American Airlines Center.

Playing with house money after winning Wednesday night in San Antonio, the Lakers went bust in a big way. Now they need a victory Saturday against the New Orleans Hornets in Oklahoma City to take two of three games on this trip.

Josh Howard had 29 points, Dirk Nowitzki 27 and Jason Terry scored 12 points and had 13 assists for Dallas, which shot 54.5 percent. The Mavericks made 60 percent of their shots in beating the Lakers here in December.

The Lakers brought in Kobe Bryant (26 points) for the end of the game. The Mavericks were never threatened, but put away the game with 3:29 left when Bryant bricked a dunk and Dallas guard Anthony Johnson ran out for a dunk at the other end.

Dallas won the second quarter, 34-20, and the third quarter, 35-24. The Lakers went 7:11 without a field goal in the third quarter.

In their victory over the Mavericks this month, the Lakers used Bryant for a stretch of the fourth quarter against Nowitzki. There was no need Thursday as Brian Cook and Vladimir Radmanovic both struggled to stop him.

The Lakers were outrebounded, 53-28, committed 16 turnovers and made just 5-of-19 3-pointers.

Jordan Farmar had a season-high 17 points in 26 minutes off the bench for the Lakers.
