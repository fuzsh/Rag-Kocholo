        "text": "Memorial Day History: The First 101 years (1868 - 1968)\n\nJump to Major Parts in this Analysis:\n\nUnderscoring Union Victory\n\nEmphasizing Unity\n\nJust Another Holiday\n\nTable of Presidential Activities on Memorial Day\n\nPresidential Authority\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nMaster Table of Memorial Day Observances\n\nUnderscoring Union Victory\n\nMemorial Day began as a kind of exclamation point for the Northern victory over the rebellious South in the Civil War.\n\nOften referred to as “Decoration Day,” the first Federal Memorial Day, May 30, 1868, was designated as a time to “decorate the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion.” That is the language of “General Order Number 11” (May 5, 1868) issued by General John Logan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). Logan also noted that \"Their soldier lives were the reveille of freedom to a race in chains, and their deaths the tattoo of rebellious tyranny in arms.\"\n\nThe GAR was a fraternal organization of Union veterans. Among other things, the GAR tried to provide support for soldier’s widows and children, and it lobbied the government on behalf of veterans and survivors. To again quote General Order 11,\". . . let us in this solemn presence renew our pledges to aid and assist those whom they have left among us a sacred charge upon a nation's gratitude, the soldier's and sailor's widow and orphan.\"\n\nOn May 26, 1868, President Andrew Johnson was narrowly acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. On May 28, 1868, he issued the first Memorial Day Order (see the \"Master Table\" below for links to specific documents). Johnson’s \"order\" is basically a request to the Executive Departments that employees be allowed, if “consistent with law and the public interests” to participate in the ceremonies. Johnson did not refer to “decorating graves” or “the rebellion.” He did not declare a holiday or suggest that workers would be on paid leave. But his order did specify “paying a fitting tribute to the memory of the brave men whose remains repose in the national cemeteries.”\n\nOn Christmas Day 1868, President Johnson pardoned all Confederates of the charge of Treason. This pardon especially cleared top Southern leaders most of whom had sought refuge abroad. Johnson's action did not diminish the fervor for “Decoration Day.”\n\nSubsequent presidential administrations from Grant in 1869 through Cleveland in 1895 (except for 1887 and 1892) issued nearly identical Memorial Day orders. They directed that the “several Departments” would be closed on May 30th to allow employees “to participate in the decoration of the graves of the soldiers who fell during the rebellion.” That is, Presidents incorporated the language of Logan’s General Orders No. 11.\n\nThe first two Grant orders that survive (1872, 1873) specify that employees may be allowed to participate in decorating graves “in connection with the Grand Army of the Republic.” This is a remarkably explicit alignment of official policy with the goals of a nominally private interest. Subsequent orders drop the reference to the GAR.\n\nIt became common to read the text of General Logan’s Orders at Memorial Day observances at least until 1949. So in principle, participants were reminded that the Federal holiday is rooted in the desire to recognize those who died defending the Union during “the rebellion.”\n\nThe explicit commitment to decorating the graves of Union troops, but not Confederates, drew complaints from the outset and reminders that the practice of decorating graves was already observed in the South. These complaints became more pointed and numerous as the years passed.\n\nEmphasizing Unity\n\nPresidents played a key role in changing the focus of Memorial Day to be more inclusive toward the Confederate dead. This was consonant with the changing political context: the end of reconstruction; the emergence of legally sanctioned racial discrimination; the rise of a globally significant United States with an interest in projecting military force; and growing Republican party awareness of the need to win Southern electoral support.\n\nAs early as 1872, the Amnesty Act (17 Stat 142) had permitted most former Confederates to hold positions in the Federal government. As specified in the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, section 3, this action required a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress.\n\nCleveland (1885-89). Grover Cleveland was the first president to firmly push against the dominant conception of how to observe Memorial Day. Cleveland was the first post-Civil War president from the Democratic Party, the first not to have served in the Civil War, and the first to include former Confederates in his Cabinet. His election depended on support from the South.\n\nAs President, Cleveland brought two former Confederates and slave owners into his Cabinet: Lucius Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi (Secretary of the Interior) and Augustus Garland of Arkansas (Attorney General). In 1886, he diverted attention from Memorial Day by announcing on May 28 that there would be a White House wedding (his to Frances Folsom) five days later. On the third Memorial Day of his term, in 1887, Cleveland went fishing. Some years later, a newspaper report on Benjamin Harrison’s Memorial Day plans headlined, “Harrison Will Not Go Fishing May 30” (Arizona Republican, 5/27/1892).\n\nIn years prior to Cleveland’s fishing trip, every President on every Memorial Day had attended formal ceremonies at Arlington, Gettysburg, Philadelphia, or New York City.\n\nHarrison (1889-93). Cleveland’s successor, Republican Benjamin Harrison (who won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote by wide margins in the South), did not go fishing. But he did make a major rhetorical gesture toward the former Confederates in his 1892 election-year speech in Rochester, NY.\n\nWe have found a plane of mutual respect, and I am glad of it, and not only this, but we have found a common country. . . . It gladdens my heart now to believe that the love of the old flag is so revived in these Southern hearts that they would vie with martial ardor to be in front of the charge if we should ever be called to meet a common enemy.\n\nHarrison and subsequent Republican Presidents made a deliberate shift to emphasize national unity among—and partisan outreach to—the White majority in the South.\n\nCleveland ( 1893-97). In 1893, at the start of his second term, Cleveland again went fishing on Memorial Day. In 1895 he announced a plan to attend Memorial Day ceremonies at the Cemetery of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital where Confederate dead were buried together with Union dead. At that ceremony, there was to be a speech by Navy Secretary Hilary Herbert, a former Confederate officer. The announced theme of Herbert’s remarks was “Reunion of the Gray and Blue.”\n\nThis plan was displaced by the unexpected death of Secretary of State Walter Gresham who received a White House funeral on May 29. Immediately after the funeral, Cleveland escorted Gresham’s coffin to Chicago where, on Memorial Day, it was entombed at Oak Woods Cemetery. Ironically, on that same day, a Confederate Monument was dedicated at that cemetery. The local GAR posts had refused to participate in those ceremonies.\n\nIn 1896, Cleveland did not participate in Memorial Day ceremonies. I have (thus far) found no reports of his activities on the day. (The media focus was on his veto of the Rivers and Harbors Bill and the question of whether the veto would be overridden.) Cleveland followed a standard Presidential practice of sending memorial wreaths to different sites.\n\nJust before Memorial Day 1896, the Supreme Court decided in Plessy v Ferguson that segregation by race in public facilities was Constitutional.\n\nMcKinley (1897-1901). President McKinley took further major steps in the Memorial Day “unity” project. His actions were connected to a variety of international tensions and US international aspirations. Memorial Day 1898 followed by less than six weeks the formal Declaration of War with Spain. In late May, McKinley issued a call for more volunteers for military service.\n\nOn Memorial Day 1898 itself, McKinley sent a letter of regret that he could not join the observances at the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, VA—the burial place of thousands of Confederates including Jefferson Davis, J. E. B. Stewart, and George E. Pickett. His Secretary of War had permitted US troops to participate in the Confederate Memorial Day procession in Richmond. After the main ceremonies at Arlington, which McKinley attended, Cleveland’s former Navy Secretary, the ex-Confederate Hilary Herbert, made remarks—a first for an Arlington Memorial Day that was noted by the Washington Post.\n\nThe war with Spain wrapped up swiftly—hostilities ended in mid-August 1898. The terms of a peace treaty were finalized on December 10. But before that date, in the midst of a “Peace Jubilee” tour of the South, McKinley made a widely noted address to the Georgia Legislature. In that speech, he spoke of national unity: “Sectional lines no longer mar the map of the United States.” And then, in words that drew prolonged cheers and seem to have been taken to be a Presidential order:\n\n[W]hile, when those graves were made, we differed widely about the future of this government, those differences were long ago settled by the arbitrament of arms; and the time has now come, in the evolution of sentiment and feeling under the providence of God, when in the spirit of fraternity we should share with you in the care of the graves of the Confederate soldiers.\n\nThat is, henceforth the Federal Memorial Day holiday would no longer be about decorating the graves of Union soldiers. It would be reconceived to be about honoring American military courage and valor, no matter what the cause—even if the cause had been a rebellion in defense of slavery.\n\nOn Memorial Day 1899, the Washington Post reported, consistent with McKinley’s Atlanta pledge, the graves of Confederate soldiers at Arlington “were decorated with unsparing hand.”\n\nIn 1900, in an address at Antietam Battlefield, McKinley continued to stress the rhetoric of unity. In the Civil War, “American soldiers never surrendered but to Americans!” And in the war with Spain,\n\nThe followers of the Confederate generals with the followers of the Federal generals fought side by side in Cuba, in Porto [sic] Rico, and in the Philippines, and together in those far-off islands are standing to-day fighting and dying for the flag they love, the flag that represents more than any other banner in the world the best hopes and aspirations of mankind.\n\nA few days later, on June 6, 1900, McKinley signed an Appropriations Bill providing funds to move the bodies of Confederate soldiers buried in the Washington D.C. region to “some suitable spot” in Arlington Cemetery.\n\nRoosevelt (1901-1909). Theodore Roosevelt sounded the unity theme with great consistency. At Gettysburg on Memorial Day 1904, he proclaimed: “All are at one now, the sons of those who wore the blue and the sons of those who wore the gray, and all can unite in paying respect to the memory of those who fell, each of them giving his life for his duty as he saw it . . .\"\n\nOn Memorial Day 1906, at the Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Roosevelt suggested that “we could not honor too highly the memory of Grant and Lee, of Sherman and Johnston, of Stonewall Jackson and Sheridan. . . .” Earlier that Spring, Roosevelt’s Secretary of War, William Howard Taft had formally approved the general location for a Confederate monument in Arlington Cemetery.\n\nTaft (1909-1913). By the time of the Taft Administration, the “unity” aspect of Memorial Day was well-established. The observances no longer emphasized Union bravery and brilliant generals. The last corps commanders from the Civil War were dead. In 1909 Taft participated in dedicating a monument not to any great general, but to regular soldiers. In 1911 and 1912, Taft’s Memorial Day speeches had little to do with the Civil War but with advocacy of international arbitration to resolve disputes (1911), and the importance of Constitutional limits (1912).\n\nThe Confederate Monument was set for construction in 1912, and Taft spoke about that fact at a November 1912 Convention of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The occasion was the day of the laying of the cornerstone for the Confederate Monument. Taft did not attend the cornerstone ceremony. That ceremony was led by Cleveland’s former Navy Secretary Hilary Herbert. However, that evening Taft again sounded his theme of unity in his speech to the UDC Convention.\n\nWilson (1913-1921). Wilson, the first Democrat elected since Grover Cleveland, celebrated Memorial Day 1913 by going for an 8-hour automobile tour of Maryland backroads. The New York Times pointed out that he had heeded the objections of veterans’ groups to the scheduling of sporting events on Memorial Day.\n\nIn 1914, after first announcing that he would not speak, Wilson spoke at Arlington and began by saying that he did not have “a prepared address.” He observed that the Union soldiers “not only reunited States, they reunited the spirits of men. [T]he very men whom they overcame in battle join in praise and gratitude that the Union was saved.”\n\nFive days later, President Wilson oversaw the formal unveiling of the Arlington Confederate Monument. His task, he said, was this: “To declare this chapter in the history of the United States closed and ended. . . [A]s we have shed our blood upon opposite sides, we now face and admire one another.”\n\nJust Another Holiday\n\nBy the time the Confederate Monument was dedicated in 1914, it had long been clear that for many Americans, Memorial Day was just a welcome holiday—especially so when it fell on a Friday or a Monday. In 1875, less than a decade after the first 1868 observance, the Baltimore Sun noted that these events “have now grown to be days for secular enjoyment. . . . [Many people have ] picnics and excursions totally unconnected with the purpose of the day.”\n\nIn 1877, the Chicago Daily Tribune prominently reported the outcome of a professional baseball game: “Chicago’s Defeated at Cincinnati.” As the day became more broadly and firmly established as a legal holiday, so did secular events.\n\nBy 1890, next to a New York Times article previewing Memorial Day events, was an overview of upcoming events in “The Athletic World.” These featured yachting, rowing, horse racing, and baseball. In 1891 The Arizona Republican sounded a plaintive reminder that “Memorial Day . . . should not be a holiday of festivities, but one of solemn remembrances.” In 1892 the New York Times editorialized that “Memorial Day is a permanent holiday. . . honoring the dead, outdoor pastimes. . . “\n\nThis holiday trend continued and consolidated. In 1909, President Taft, who was known as a baseball fan, preceded Memorial Day ceremonies at Gettysburg with a stop in Pittsburgh to attend a baseball game. (Taft’s brother was one of the owners of the Chicago National League Team.). The year 1911 marked the initiation of an annual automobile race at Indianapolis—always on Memorial Day. In 1913, the New York Times had no front-page article about Memorial Day, but there was one about the resumption of horse racing at Belmont Park.\n\nSo, eventually, it would not be surprising or disturbing if the President did not attend a formal Memorial Day observance and instead took a short vacation from the job.\n\nBy the late 1930s, a feature of newspaper reports on Memorial Day include reports of heavy holiday traffic, accidents, and fatalities.\n\nThe table immediately below shows whether presidents personally attended Memorial Day Ceremonies and whether they spoke.\n\nFrom Grant through McKinley, (8 presidents, 33 years) presidents attended ceremonies 88 percent of the time (that is, all except Cleveland), but only spoke 21 percent of the time. For the period from Theodore Roosevelt through Hoover, (5 presidents, 33 years) presidents attended Memorial Day ceremonies 90 percent of the time, and they spoke at 90 percent of the ceremonies they attended. From FDR through LBJ, (5 presidents 35 years) presidents attended ceremonies only 36 percent of the time, and when attending, made a speech or remarks only about 40 percent of the time. In that last period, none of the extensive speeches were “traditional” Memorial Day speeches focusing primarily on the meaning of, and our gratitude for, past sacrifices.\n\nPresidential Activities on Memorial Day, Ulysses Grant – Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n+(The number of ceremonies personally attended)/(the number of ceremonial days that occurred during the President’s service).\n\nPresidential Authority\n\nIn 1868, at the time of the first Memorial Day observance, it was not entirely clear that the President had the authority to exempt workers from work on special occasions. Prior presidents had closed the Executive Departments during periods of mourning following the death of presidents. But in 1868 there were no legally defined Federal holidays. Arguably, there was no explicit authority to simply shut down some or parts of the government. This changed dramatically in a matter of years when holidays were authorized.\n\nLegislation signed June 28, 1870, designated a group of named holidays (New Year’s, July 4, Christmas) as “holidays” but only within the District of Columbia (16 Stat. 168). The law also included among such holidays ”any day appointed . . . by the President. . . as a day of public fast or thanksgiving.” The law did not address whether or not government employees would be paid, or the instance of Memorial Day. It primarily addressed commercial transactions that had maturity or payment dates that might be affected by the holiday.\n\nBut in short order, that changed (citations to these laws are given in the table) :\n\nA law of 1/31/1879 added Washington’s Birthday to the official DC holiday list.\n\nA law of 4/16/1880 provided that wages would be paid on legal holidays for employees of the Government Printing Office if other government employees were paid.\n\nA law of 4/3/1881 called for paying DC government employees in 1881 for Inauguration Day and Memorial Day.\n\nA law of 3/3/1883 required seven hours of work from government employees except on Sundays or days “declared public holidays by law, or executive order.” This explicitly empowered presidents to declare holidays on their own authority, and this section was cited in the next six Memorial Day orders.\n\nA law of 1/6/1885 specifies a number of paid holidays, including Memorial Day, for employees in Washington DC.\n\nA law of 2/23/1887 specifies that both Memorial Day and July 4 are to be paid holidays for all Federal employees, not just those in Washington DC.\n\nA law of 8/1/1888 makes Memorial Day a holiday for all in Washington DC, not just Federal employees. At this point, if not already in 1887, any presidential Executive Order authorizing Memorial Day became superfluous, but it was issued at least another seven times!\n\nA law of 3/3/1893 (27 Stat 715) prohibited the closing of the Executive departments \"as a mark to the memory of any deceased ex-official of the United States.\"\n\nA law of 6/28/1894 adds Labor Day to the Federal holiday lineup.\n\nNone of these acts authorized a President to change the observance of a holiday to a different day if it fell on a Sunday. Nonetheless, presidents repeatedly ordered the observance of Federal Memorial Day to a day other than Sunday. In 1875 (to Saturday); 1880 (to Saturday); 1886 (to Monday). On later occasions when there was no published order, the observance was also moved: 1909 (to Monday); 1915 (to Monday); 1926 (to Monday); 1937 (to Monday).\n\nThe Sunday 5/30 date was observed by (and proclaimed by) the President in 1948, 1954, and 1965. But in 1965, the Washington Post reported that “Monday [5/31] has been declared an official holiday. Both Federal and District Government offices will be closed.” It is not clear where this declaration was published or by whom. (I would be delighted to be informed about this point.)\n\nThis practice was made irrelevant by the 1968 Uniform Monday Holiday Act (82 Stat 250) specifying that Memorial Day would be on the “last Monday in May.”\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nScholars have not found much of interest in “ceremonial” Presidential orders or in the substance of their remarks on ceremonial occasions. But this is a mistake, at least with respect to Memorial Day.\n\nThe presidential “unity project” of the late 19th century was bipartisan. It was Cleveland’s clear goal, but emerged as bipartisan during the term of Benjamin Harrison. In the search for unity, Presidents contributed their authority and voice to defining a moral equivalence between the leaders and soldiers of the Confederacy and of the Union. This was explicit in their language.\n\nThis equivalence supported an emerging system of racial discrimination and segregation sustained in law and regulations. That system shaped American life for generations, and as of 2024 is by no means in the past.\n\nOne visible indicator of this system—and the unity project--was the spread of monuments and other symbols (such as named buildings and places) honoring Confederates and their leaders.\n\nThe extent of these public “symbols of the Confederacy” has been documented in a 2019 study published by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The SPLC study identifies 1270 instances of the dedication of sites recognizing the Confederacy between 1866 and 2017. (The SPLC study seems, oddly, not to include the Confederate Monuments at Arlington Cemetery and at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago—so it’s not complete.)\n\nIn the 26 years from 1866 through 1891--the year before Benjamin Harrison’s Memorial Day speech rhetorically embracing the “unity project”—SPLC data show 117 Confederate symbols were dedicated.\n\nIn the 21 years from 1892 through 1912 (the year the cornerstone for the Confederate Monument was laid at Arlington Cemetery), the SPLC counts 424 additional dedications. The peak year for new dedications in the entire dataset was 1911 (under President Taft).\n\nThe “unity project” was a remarkable success.\n\nFrom 1913-1933, the next 21-year period, an additional three hundred commemorations were dedicated. Of these, 129 were during the presidency of Woodrow Wilson.\n\nIn 2017, violent demonstrations in Charlottesville, VA were linked to a plan to remove a monument to Robert E. Lee. The 2020 killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers helped advance over 180 additional decisions—often with controversy--to remove public monuments and named facilities honoring Confederates.\n\nThis all reminds us that consistent Presidential rhetoric—and policy action--devoted toward a specific theme, can be consequential. This has been particularly true for Memorial Day, which, after all, did not begin as a day of unity."
