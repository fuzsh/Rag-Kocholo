        "text": "Martinsville’s Tuskegee Airman, Armour McDaniel, was honored in February with the gift of a framed photograph of a wreath on his grave at Arlington National Cemetery and a flag flown over the Virginia state capital.\n\nThe presentation was made Tuesday at Hugo’s, coordinated by former Martinsville Mayor Danny Turner and veteran W.C. Fowlkes. State Sen. Bill Stanley (R-Franklin County) presented the flag to McDaniel’s cousin, Imogene Draper of Martinsville, and local veteran Jimmy Wilson of Axton and city councilwoman Jennifer Bowles came to the ceremony to pay their respects.\n\nStanley said that the General Assembly passed a resolution honoring Tuskegee Airmen last week.\n\n“We need to preserve their history and make sure other generations” know their story as well, Stanley said.\n\n“It is an honor and a privilege” to have placed the wreath on his grave and then give Draper a picture of it, Turner said. He and Fowlkes were among a group of local people who laid wreaths on the graves of local veterans at Arlington National Cemetery in December.\n\n“It was certainly rewarding to me, being a career military guy myself,” Fowlkes said.\n\nBorn in 1916, McDaniel was the son of Charlie and Mary Earley McDaniel and a grandson of Sallie Ann Thomas Earley, Draper said. The family owned the land where the Patrick Henry Mall now stands.\n\n“We have always been proud of Armour’s choices in his career,” she said.\n\nHe was a graduate of Piedmont Christian Institute. He earned a bachelor's degree from Virginia State College (now University), a degree in economics from Temple University and teacher qualification from Rider College in New Jersey.\n\nA cousin told him about the Tuskegee program, “and he chose to volunteer. And the rest is history,” Draper said.\n\nTuskegee Airmen were the first black American military pilots in World War II. They broke barriers in an age when black men were not welcome in the military.\n\nNine hundred thirty-two airmen were graduated from the Tuskegee program, and only 355 — including McDaniel — served in active duty. The Tuskegee program had 10,000 support personnel.\n\nArmour McDaniel, who died in 1989 at age 73, described his experience in a 1987 article for the Indianapolis News. “The people in the Air Corps did not feel that blacks had the capability of flying,” he told reporter Steven Pockrass. “They found every excuse to discourage us.”\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHe always used to tell his family that “when he was in the air, he was as free as he ever would be in this life,” Draper said.\n\nThe airmen’s first assignments were nothing special, according to reports. Eventually a lead officer, Col. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., advocated for them to get significant missions. They were assigned to the 15th Air Force in June 1944 to escort white bomber pilots. Under their protection, the bomber pilots, whose losses had been high before then, were guarded safely from then on.\n\n“All of the bomber pilots knew when they saw the Red Tails they were safe,” Stanley said.\n\nThey painted the tails of their airplanes red, which gave them the nickname “Red Tails.” The Red Tails completed 1,578 successful missions, according to an article from May 18, 2003 by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nMcDaniel joined the Army in 1942 and graduated in one of the first flight classes at Tuskegee Army Air Field in 1943. He was stationed in Italy with the all-black 332nd Fighter Group, which provided air cover for ships entering the Naples harbor and escorted bombers into Germany.\n\nA picture from one of his missions has been memorialized in the National Aerospace Museum in the Smithsonian Institute as well as the book “History of the Tuskegee Airmen” and in Time/Life books. It shows the damaged left wing of his plane. In 1944, McDaniel led an attack on German barges on the Dannile River, headed toward Austria. He destroyed six barges, each with about 250 troops. The left wing of his plane was hit by a shell, but he made it back to his base.\n\nMcDaniel described another of his close calls in “The Tuskegee Airmen: The Men Who Changed a Nation” by Charles E. Francis and Adolph Caso.\n\n“After Elsberry (another pilot) attacked the leader, I attacked the leader’s wingman,” McDaniel said in an interview. “I couldn’t catch him somehow, but glancing downward, I saw another enemy pilot trying to make his getaway. I dived on him, dropping from 27,000 feet to 10,000 feet. When I fired on him, he dove through some clouds and crashed against a mountain. I pulled up just in time to miss crashing into the mountains.”\n\nIn March 1945, his plane was shot down, and he was taken as a prisoner of war. It was his longest mission of the war and the squadron’s first encounter with German jet planes, which could outmaneuver the American planes considerably. His plane was in the lead position, and it was hit.\n\nHe made his first combat jump to bail out of the plane, and both legs were fractured when he landed. German military took him to Nuremburg, later transferred him to Munich and ultimately Stalag Luf 7A at Moosburg, Germany. He was rescued by Gen. George S. Patton.\n\nMcDaniel continued his military career, which included combat in Korea.\n\nAfter retiring in 1965, McDaniel became a civil rights specialist with the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in New York.\n\nHe was buried in Arlington Cemetery with full military rites in 1989. His widow, Faye McDaniel, still lives in Indianapolis.\n\nMcDaniel was “a great Virginian, a great American,” Stanley said.\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
