The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:00 p.m., in the Board Room, Academy School District 20 Headquarters, 1110 Chapel Hills Drive, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Hon. John J. Hall [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Hall, Lamborn, and Salazar. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN HALL Mr. Hall. Good afternoon. Thank you for your patience. The Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, hearing on ``Is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cemetery Construction Policy Meeting the Needs of Today's Veterans and Their Families,'' will now come to order. I would ask everyone to please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance. [Pledge of Allegiance.] Thank you all for coming today. I'm sorry my plane was a little bit delayed, but it's wonderful to be here in Representative Doug Lamborn's district. And we're fortunate to also have Representative Salazar joining us. Without objection, he's been asked to join us on the dais. The title you've just heard, a long but necessary one, ``Is the VA Cemetery Construction Policy Meeting the Needs of Today's Veterans and Their Families,'' a topic of particular importance to this region and throughout the country. First a couple of preliminaries. I mentioned Congressman John Salazar, from the 3rd District of Colorado and also a Member of the Committee, who is, by unanimous consent, joining us on the dais. Without objection, so ordered. And I would also like to recognize Scott Prestige from the office of Congressman Mark Udall from the 2nd District of Colorado, who is in the audience and has a statement, which I will ask, without objection, if we can enter that into the record also. [The statement of Congressman Udall appears on p. 61.] So it's a pleasure to be here with all of you and to bring the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee out into the country and actually see people and have them see and speak to us and see how we operate. Congressman Lamborn was kind enough to come to the 19th District of New York, where I live, the home of the military academy of West Point and which I am proud to represent. I'm proud and honored also to be in Air Force country, especially since it's not football season. We'll be working on that. I'm also pleased to know that H.R. 1660, a bill that passed in the House sponsored by Congressman Salazar--that you are also a lead cosponsor. Mr. Lamborn. Yes, I am. Mr. Hall. Both of you sponsored or supported legislation to build a national cemetery in the southern Colorado region, which passed the full House unanimously and now awaits action from the Senate. Mr. Salazar, I know that you, and Ranking Member Lamborn, as well as the rest of the Colorado delegation, have worked on the VA's national cemetery policy concerns in your region on a bipartisan basis. I'm glad we're able to bring this hearing to your State where these issues are front and center. I also would, parenthetically, tell you that I'm proud that this Subcommittee, and the full VA Committee are, if not the most, certainly among the most bipartisan in the House of Representatives and in the Congress. We occasionally differ on how to pay for things, but we almost always agree on what needs to be done, and that is to take care of America's veterans. Last preliminaries: In accordance with Committee rules, I ask all cell phones and pagers to be turned off, including mine, as we have a lot of business to conduct in a short period of time and we want to have as few interruptions as possible. Also, out of respect for our witnesses, I ask for the audience to please refrain from speaking out of order. This is not--I had to tell the folks in my district, too--this is not actually a public hearing. This is a Congressional hearing. We have panels of witnesses scheduled that will take up the time allotted. But I'm sure you can get a few words in with us individually on our way out after the hearing is over if you need to do that. My thanks to the witnesses for coming today to appear before the Subcommittee. The issues, I know, though pertinent to the cemetery policy at the VA, are of the utmost importance to you, and I look forward to receiving your testimonies. On a personal note, it is a special privilege for me as Chair of the Subcommittee to conduct it in my Ranking Member's district. Mr. Doug Lamborn, it's been an honor serving with him. Moreover, it's an honor for me to be able to address the issues facing veterans in or nearby their homes. Although my district, the 19th of New York, is thousands of miles away in the Hudson Valley, beautiful in a different way than the beauty that you see every day here, we share a lot of similarities. We both have one of our Nation's fine military academies, West Point and the Air Force Academy. Also, our district houses many prominent military installations. Both places are ones where a high percentage of our Nation's veterans call home and return after their service to live most of or sometimes all of their lives. My mother-in-law still goes to the commissary, as her husband is buried at West Point. So I understand the magnetism that these areas hold for those who graduate from these institutions or serve in these communities. I understand also that southern Colorado is home to one of the largest concentrations of World War II and Vietnam veterans in our country. Since their genesis on July 17, 1862, national cemeteries have served as the hallowed resting place for our Nation's veterans and their loved ones. Currently, VA operates 125 national cemeteries in 39 States and Puerto Rico and maintains over 2.8 million grave sites. The annual number of burials is on the uprise, with just 36,000 in 1973, up to over 100,200 in 2006. Veterans who have served in this country's armed services are buried in cemeteries operated by the States, the VA, the Department of Interior, Arlington National Cemetery and American Battle Monuments Commission. VA also provides grants to over 69 State veteran cemeteries under its National Cemetery Administration's State Cemetery Grants Program that operates in 35 States, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. We are here today to examine the adequacy of VA's current policy, which entails locating national cemeteries in areas with a large concentration of unserved veterans, and providing reasonable access to a burial option in the national or State veterans cemetery within 75 miles of their residence. As such, VA concludes that new national cemeteries will be established in areas with an unserved veteran population threshold of 170,000 within a 75-mile radius. Under this policy, 83 percent of all veterans are served, the converse of which means that there are at least 17 percent or nearly 2 million veterans and their families who are underserved by this policy. The Subcommittee also addressed the VA's national cemetery policy issues during a hearing held on May 8, 2007, wherein I expressed concerns of whether this policy was adequate enough to address both rural and urban locations. Those concerns still stand. I also think it's critical that VA makes sure that there's plenty of opportunity for public input during any new cemetery policy or location selection process. I know that VA is currently conducting its own study of these criteria and has plans to move the percentage of veterans served to 90 percent by fiscal year 2010. I look forward to hearing more about these plans during your testimony. In the way of follow-up to last year's hearing, I would like to be updated on the current status of the VA's national shrine commitment. Lastly, the Subcommittee has been apprised of a situation at Greenwood Island, the old Camp Jefferson Davis site and the soldiers' asylum home in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where veterans of the Mexican-American War are buried but whose resting places are being eroded by nature and construction. It is reported that some of the coffins and/or bodies have become disinterred and have been found by local fishermen. Whereas I appreciate the National Cemetery Administration's (NCA's) response provided to staff, I would like to know the NCA implications of this situation, if any, and how we can remedy this grievous oversight. I now recognize Ranking Member Lamborn for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Chairman Hall appears on p. 43.] OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DOUG LAMBORN Mr. Lamborn. Good afternoon. And I would like to personally thank you, Chairman Hall, and your staff for agreeing to hold this hearing. There is a lot of work involved with bringing Congress to southern Colorado, and I appreciate it. It is an honor to participate in this important occasion. I remember fondly the field hearing this Subcommittee had on veterans disabilities in your Congressional district last year. It was a productive meeting, as this promises to be. I sure enjoyed and learned from the tour of West Point, which also is in your district. I know you have a very tight schedule, but I hope your plans open up so that you can have that tour of the Air Force Academy I told you about, and I'd love to take you on before you have to go, but if your schedule permits. I would also like to thank all of the witnesses for being here today. Their statements will be helpful, interesting, informative and deeply moving. I want to thank my friend, Representative John Salazar for being here. I also want to thank everyone in the audience. You are interested in this issue, and you have come today. We also have students from Aspen Valley High School with us today. I want to especially thank my friend, Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, Bill Tuerk, for joining us here today to discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs policy for the location and construction of new national cemeteries. This is truly a momentous occasion. There has never before been a field hearing in this Congressional district on this vital subject of a national veterans cemetery. Fortunately, in Under Secretary Tuerk, we have the highest-ranking official within the VA who works on this issue. Mr. Chairman, property honoring a deceased veteran is one of our most sacred and solemn responsibilities. These patriots have earned a place of honor in our national shrines. Veterans and their families are due the tribute and thanks of a grateful Nation. We should ensure that the final resting place for those who have given so much is accessible to family members and loved ones. This way they can come and pay tribute to the service of those brave men and women who have borne the sacrifice in defense of liberty. We are seeing increased demand on all of our national cemeteries, especially as members of the greatest generation pass from our presence. VA estimates that interments in national cemeteries will rise from the current level of 2.8 million to 3.2 million by 2012. VA also estimates that as early as 2016 or as late as 2020, Fort Logan National Cemetery will be at full capacity and they will be looking to construct a replacement cemetery. Today, Mr. Chairman, we will hear very moving and eloquent testimony from Coloradans who are personally affected by the distance of the Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver from the Pikes Peak area. I believe there is a better way to determine needs than simply drawing circles and a 75-mile radius around a national cemetery to determine where the most underserved veterans are located. There are many other factors that should be taken into account, including travel time to and from national cemeteries, access to public transportation in the area, weather conditions, climate restrictions, and other factors that may affect one part of the country, such as the front range of Colorado more than another. In addition, VA needs to focus greater attention than ever on demographic trends to determine with increased accuracy where veterans are most likely to live in the future. It is my understanding that the 75-mile rule was created many years ago. We are in the 21st century now, and with the advent of technologies like GPS, it is very easy to determine driving distances and times. For instance, by doing a simple Google search, I discovered that a veteran from Lake George, Colorado, which is about 60 miles as the crow flies from Fort Logan, must travel 105 miles by road, with a driving time of over 2 hours, not including poor weather or traffic. According to the 75-mile rule, this veteran from Lake George is considered served by Fort Logan. I would venture to say that he is underserved. This example only points out a flaw within the 75-mile rule and does not take into account the tens of thousands of veterans who live beyond 75-mile radius here in southern Colorado. As this rule, in my opinion anyway, is arbitrary and outdated, I propose that the Department of Veterans Affairs determine a 21st century process for selecting national cemetery sites that takes into account factors in addition to veteran population and straight-line distance. I would offer my services and those of my staff and even the many willing veterans in this district who have been working on this issue for over a decade now. I believe that with a little hard work we could fine-tune a process that would serve more veterans and hopefully the same or perhaps even a lower cost in VA's current system. Since bureaucratic hurdles have made it hard for such a processed change to take place, my friend Representative Salazar and I have had to help alert VA to the glaring inequities associated with the current process. Mr. Chairman, it is for that reason that I was pleased to work with you and Representative Salazar to pass H.R. 1660 with my amendment out of the VA Committee and out of the House last year. This bill would authorize the establishment of a national cemetery in southern Colorado, in El Paso County in particular, and would greatly benefit the veterans and their families in all of southern Colorado. H.R. 1660 represents a major step forward to the campaign to establish a national cemetery, and I urge our colleagues in the Senate to take this bill up as soon as possible. And Representative Salazar, I'm going to ask you to talk once again with your brother, who as you all may know is one of the U.S. Senators from here in Colorado. I also hope that all of our witnesses understand that when this legislation is enacted, we must always work together to help the National Cemetery Administration within the VA find a suitable location for this cemetery, and that this would serve the highest number, therefore, of veterans and their families. I want to thank everyone once again for being here today, and I'm looking forward to the testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. [The prepared statement of Congressman Lamborn appears on p. 44.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Lamborn. I would now recognize Congressman Salazar for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN T. SALAZAR Mr. Salazar. I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I think that most of you may know John Hall. He's a famous songwriter, with the band Orleans, and wrote the songs, ``You're Still the One'' and ``Dance With Me.'' We appreciate you coming to Colorado. What do you think about the snow here in the Springs? Mr. Hall. I wish I would have brought my skis, and I wish I would have had time to use them. Mr. Salazar. I want to thank both you and Ranking Member Lamborn for having this important hearing here in Colorado. Let me just take a moment, briefly, to thank all of you in the audience who have served this country and your families. The great sacrifice that you've made is the reason that we have the greatest country in the world, in my opinion. I had the opportunity to serve at the tail end of the Vietnam War. My father was a World War II veteran. My son served two tours right after 9/11. We come from a long line of veterans, and I know the sacrifices that your families have made. What we're about to do here is a monumental task that we have taken on. Mr. Lamborn, I appreciate your hard work. You've truly been a champion on veterans issues, as you have, Mr. Hall. This legislation that we've been talking about was legislation that Congressman Hefley, Mr. Lamborn's predecessor, had worked on for nearly 15 years, on trying to create a southern Colorado cemetery. We got together earlier this year, Mr. Lamborn and I worked together on trying to provide language that would actually create what we call now the new southern Colorado veterans cemetery. According to the Congressional Research Service, which is a non-partisan office that provides research and information to Members of Congress, there are over 150,000 veterans that are making southern Colorado their home. The residents of southern Colorado have a long, long history of serving in the military. Until recently, Pueblo was America's only city that had four living recipients of the Medal of Honor. Congress realized 15 years ago, and recognized Pueblo, Colorado, America's ``Home of Heroes.'' During the Vietnam War, almost 10 percent of Colorado soldiers killed in action were from Pueblo. Southern Colorado veterans and their families have been awaiting for an accessible veterans cemetery for far too long. When they pass away, they deserve facilities that are close to their families. It is wrong to expect a family to have to travel hundreds of miles in some areas to find a final resting place for their loved ones, simply because the current regulations do not take rural areas into account. I've had the opportunity to visit one of the most beautiful cemeteries that I've ever seen in my life with Under Secretary Tuerk in Georgia. That's the way that we should honor those who have served us. During the winter months in Colorado, especially in my district where most of it is mountains, the mountain passes are often closed. In fact, in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, just earlier today there was over six inches of snow. All too often, widows have to drive over 700 miles round-trip from Cortez, Colorado, to Fort Logan to see their loved ones. I was proud to be the author of H.R. 1660 along with Mr. Lamborn, which directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for veterans in southern Colorado. This bill would do several things. It would place a veterans cemetery between Pueblo and Colorado Springs. Mr. Lamborn and I agreed during our discussions that, rightfully so, it should be in El Paso County because we have the largest number of military personnel. This is not only an Air Force issue, Mr. Chairman. It is also an Army issue. We have Fort Carson right here in El Paso County, just on the south side of Colorado Springs. And I'm a little partial to the Army because I served in the U.S. Army. The House of Representatives has shown strong support for our bill by adopting it in a unanimous voice vote on May 23, 2007. Veterans in our district, and veterans service organizations agree that a cemetery is critical and that the need will continue to grow. We have information that Fort Logan will probably not be accepting more burials after about 10 years from now. We're getting fairly full there. In a letter of support, the Military Order of the Purple Heart wrote, ``The defenders of our Nation's freedom and their families deserve much better. They deserve a national cemetery located in southern Colorado where they chose to live out their lives. We shouldn't punish those veterans for where they choose to live. The 150,000 veterans serving in Colorado served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the Iraq conflicts. They chose to make southern Colorado their home. Our Nation should honor that service by providing them a final resting place.'' It is not fair for our Nation to force a widow to drive from Alamosa over 500 miles round-trip or to drive from Cortez over 700 miles round-trip. We're placing a huge burden on the families with the added cost of the trip, and with the high price of fuel right now. National cemeteries are the final act of gratitude that we bestow upon those who served our Nation. They give families comfort and inspire future generations by preserving the memory of our heroes that are no longer with us. I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and the experts here with us today, on the current regulations and how we can better improve them to serve more veterans, especially those in rural areas. It is my understanding under the current regulations, that there would never be another cemetery built in a rural area, and actually in many States that are sparsely populated, western States such as Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, because of sparse population. With that, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to thank you for having this hearing here today. And I want to welcome our guests. I appreciate your being here to testify. Mr. Hall. Thank you, Congressman Salazar. I ask unanimous consent that the opening statement of Congressman Udall from the Second District of Colorado be accepted into the record. Without objection, so ordered. Welcome to our panelists. Before we move to the first panel, I wanted to--in case you're curious who you're looking at, there are staff who I also want to thank from both sides of the aisle here on the dais. We have majority Staff Director and Counsel of the Subcommittee, Kimberly Ross, and Minority Staff, Jon Clark. Thank you to our stenographers and recordkeepers, without which this would not be an official hearing. All panelists, I would like to remind you that your complete written statements have been made a part of the hearing record. So please limit your remarks so that we may have sufficient time to follow up with questions, once everyone has had the opportunity to provide testimony. Joining us on our first panel is Linda Lee-Witt, President of the Gold Star Widows, and Milly Briseno, an Iraq war widow. Thank you and welcome to the table, please. Excuse me--Past Secretary of Gold Star Widows. Ms. Lee-Witt. I still have to correct you, Mr. Chairman. I am a member of the Gold Star Wives of America, and I am a Past Secretary for the local chapter. Mr. Hall. Past Secretary of the local chapter and member of the Gold Star Wives of America. Thank you. It's an honor to have you before us today. And, Ms. Lee-Witt, you are now recognized for 5 minutes. Speak into the microphone, and make sure it's turned on, please. STATEMENTS OF LINDA LEE-WITT, PETERSON AFB, COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, MEMBER, GOLD STAR WIVES OF AMERICA; AND MILLY BRISENO, CO- FOUNDER, COLORADO MILITARY SURVIVORS, COLORADO SPRINGS, CO (IRAQ WAR WIDOW) STATEMENT OF LINDA LEE-WITT Ms. Lee-Witt. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee. I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. My name is Linda Lee-Witt. I am a member of the Gold Star Wives of America and the Administrative Officer of the Retiree Activities Office of Southern Colorado, in the 21st space wing, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs. My testimony, however, today will be my story as a widow of a veteran. My husband, Robert, grew up in a military family. His father served during World War II and retired as a major from the Army. As a child, Bob lived and went to school all over the world. Like his father, he dedicated his whole career to the U.S. Government. He served with the United States Air Force and in Vietnam. After retiring from the Air Force in 1978, he continued to serve his country in civil service, in safety engineering at Fort Carson here in Colorado Springs, where he deployed with the troops wherever they went. His passion for the safety of the young soldiers was deep, and he identified with what they and their families faced every day. He died from a service-connected cancer on November 3, 2004, in our home. Due to the weather conditions, which you all saw yesterday. We had a blizzard early in November, and our driveway has a steep incline. Due to that, when the mortuary van came, they couldn't get up the driveway to take my husband's body down to the van, and our son had to put his father's body in a four-wheel drive to take down to the mortuary van. I wanted my husband to be buried with the full honor and respect that he so deserved, and for months I kept his ashes, not wanting them in a civilian cemetery. Eventually, to my regret now, I chose to have his remains buried at the National Veterans Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. His parents are buried there. All of my children are here. My grandchildren are here. Had there been an appropriate cemetery in El Paso County, without question I would have had his remains here. We weren't a part of the military community at that time. It was civil service, and he'd been retired from civil service. So I had really never heard of Fort Logan, and it sounds maybe a little bit strange, but I thought Fort Logan was a town somewhere. I didn't know about Fort Logan being a military cemetery, a veterans cemetery. Together as a family, probably we will never be able to coordinate a trip together to Tennessee to visit my husband's grave. I would love for my grandchildren to see how this country honors our veterans, when they pass. I'd love for them to see the hundreds of headstones, their grandfather's among them, and know the freedoms and the rights that they have today are because of the men and women like their grandfather who were willing to give their lives for those freedoms. Working with the wives of servicemembers in the World War II and Vietnam era, they express how hard it is to make the trip to Denver. Some of them with their advanced age, many are unable or afraid to drive themselves and they have to ask someone to take them. Talking with young widows of today's war, the hardship for them is to take the whole day with young children and visit their husband's graves. The logistics involved getting to Fort Logan are trying, and many families have a hard time finding Fort Logan, from what I understand. Because of the sporadic unpredictable climate here in El Paso County, from late spring to fall, I-25 is often impassable. Monument Hill, just north of town, can be treacherous. For the widow, visiting the grave site is one of the most important elements in the grieving process. And those first months, the loss and the feeling of aloneness is almost like fear. Visiting the grave is a way for us--some of us to connect to our spouse. Eventually, an acceptance of the fact that they're no longer here. For the children, it's seeing that their parent was given a place of honor, a resting place of honor. As with my husband, many of our service men and women and their families opt to stay and live in Colorado Springs after their military service. We have a huge military presence in Colorado Springs and it's rapidly growing, yet we have no national veterans cemetery to accommodate them when they're put to rest. El Paso County's need for a national cemetery is vital to the health and well-being of our widows, the dependents and our community. It's my hope that based on the hardships endured by the military widows and families in the southern Colorado area and the large military presence here, that the VA would grant El Paso County a national veterans cemetery. Congressman Lamborn, I'd like to thank you for arranging this today, and thank you, too, to your staff for the support you give the military. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lee-Witt appears on p. 45.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Ms. Lee-Witt. Ms. Briseno, you are now recognized for your opening statement. STATEMENT OF MILLY BRISENO Ms. Briseno. Thank you so much for taking the time out to hear about our experiences as younger widows. At the height of my husband's 17-year Army career and in the 13th year of our marriage, our life came to screeching halt. An unexpected massive stoke at the age of 35 took his vibrant life from this temporary home and left my three children and me reeling as we struggled for direction and purpose in this completely unfamiliar world of loss. My husband's death was not combat-related, but from natural causes. My husband's untimely death came just 1 month after moving to Fort Carson. As a young family full of promise and a bright future, we never thought to discuss burial plans. I really struggled to know how to honor his life as a dedicated soldier, whose career in the Army Medical Specialist Corps demonstrated his commitment and the restoration and preservation of life. To honor him and affirm my family's identity as a military family, we chose to bury my husband at a national cemetery. We chose Fort Logan. Fort Logan was the closest one to our home and my in-laws' home. It has been difficult to visit his grave site, for many reasons. We really do want to visit more. My family and my in-laws reside in Colorado Springs, near Fort Carson. The travel distance to such a congested metropolitan area poses great inconveniences from my young family. At the time of my husband's death, my children were 9, 5, and 2\\1/2\\ years old. A trip to Fort Logan involves an entire day's plans. It is quite challenging at times for the children. With the weather here in Colorado, we mainly make it to Fort Logan, at the most, two times per year. We miss most of our significant special occasions, such as birthdays, anniversaries and other holidays, because they occur in the fall and winter seasons. As a family, we try to set a goal to get to Fort Logan, at least for Memorial Day. The effects of limited visits to Fort Carson have had an impact in these first 3 years of grief, not only for my immediate family, but also for my mother and father-in-law, my husband's sisters and their families who reside in Colorado Springs. Our family has had less participation in commemorative events, which occur at Fort Logan. We have less opportunities to connect with the military's sensitive and supportive community, which can be found among the visitors at Fort Logan. My family may miss out on one way to continually affirm their military identity. And personally, I myself have struggled with having less access to an acceptable place to face the reality of grief and process those complicated emotions. It is difficult to deal with grief as a younger widow with young children. Through my involvement with Colorado military survivors, I have found that a new generation of widows are emerging. This new group of widows faces additional struggles in dealing with grief because we do not fit the common stereotype. I attend a widows' support group at Fort Carson, which averages from five to eight participants, and we meet twice a month. Up until recently, I was the oldest one by at least a decade. We are finding that we must find a safe place to face our grief, one in which we have opportunities to express our emotions of loss and pain. That is why we gather together, and that is why I wish we were closer to Fort Logan. The small plot of land that I stake claim to in Denver holds a vital place in my ability to process my grief. My husband's headstone is an immovable reminder that forces me to face the heartache involved in the unexpected ending of his earthly story. His headstone solemnly stands among thousands of its kind at Fort Logan. To most, these pale stones represent so much pain and suffering. But to me, they each hold a story. They are just like a sea of bookends. The dates engraved on my husband's headstone tell the beginning and the finale of his life. His headstone is a fixed mark that causes me to focus on the finale, and the heartache. A cemetery is an acceptable place in our society to express one's grief. Young widows find very few acceptable places to deal with their loss. With now almost 3 years of learning in the obstacle course of grief, I realize the necessity of exercising this heartache. It has taken me a long time to come to the understanding that heartache is strength training. It helps transform the weakness of my faith into a powerful conditioned response to my loss. Once only heartache, pierced through with fear, now has become thanksgiving that appreciates the work of sorrow. Military loss is more complex. It is a traumatic loss, especially for young families that face this sudden tragedy. Our society still puts expectations on grief recovery. Because of the traumatic grief that military families endure, their bereavement is prolonged and can be more difficult. It is a lifelong process to learn to move forward with one's grief. As an organization, Colorado military survivors strives to unite survivors in their loss, and help them find strength in a community well acquainted with sorrow. My initial connection with one of my dear friends now, also a young widow with two young children, was made at Fort Logan when I discovered that her husband was buried just two rows away from mine. Together we face each day encouraging each other to press on, to remember to have faith in God, and to grow through our grief in order to help one another. If we were able to be closer to a place that would help us face these challenges with greater strength, we could be more effective in encouraging a new generation of grieving families. We could accomplish this by affirming their value and assuring them of the honored place of appreciation that their loved ones' treasured stories hold in our community. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Briseno appears on p. 46.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Ms. Briseno and Ms. Lee-Witt. You each have a bottle of water in front of you that you may open and drink if you'd like, courtesy of the Subcommittee. I will just ask a couple questions, and then try and leave more time for our Colorado Representatives to ask theirs. Ms. Lee-Witt, first, let me express my sympathy to you and also Ms. Briseno, and my thanks for your gift to our country and for your loved ones, your husband's gift to our country, and blessings on you and them. Also thank you for coming here and for having the fortitude to come and tell us your story. I know the national cemetery policy is complicated, and that the problems that you described exist in many locations, including my home State of New York. But, Ms. Lee-Witt, can you tell me more about what you and your organization have done to bring a national cemetery to Colorado, and the response to those efforts? Please use the microphone. Ms. Lee-Witt. As far as Gold Star Wives, Rose Lee is a gold star wife, she is on this very Committee in DC. Locally, here, we don't really have a group that meets. We donate to the NALP organization. It's a non-profit organization. The widows who are involved in the government in Washington, D.C., really do a lot there and testify on behalf of military widows. I think Rose Lee was just in Florida for this very--this very discussion on the cemeteries. So that's what the Gold Star Wives do. As far as what I do with the Retired Activities Office, I try to help widows and retirees. I'm in contact with them and help direct them to the people that they need to meet to get what they should have in benefits and support. I didn't know a lot of this, of course, again, until after my husband died. So Gold Star Wives is active in this very thing, right here in the Springs, and at the base, we help the retirees. Mr. Hall. Well, thank you. And of course, thanks for the work that the Gold Star Wives do. We see Ms. Lee very frequently in Washington. Ms. Briseno, you mentioned in your testimony the personal struggle of having to travel long distances to visit your loved one, and I want to thank you for sharing a rather poetic testimony with us, of how you've had to endure this journey and this tremendous inconvenience. It's a journey, not only a physical one, but an emotional and spiritual one as well. In terms of the future, can you describe how an additional cemetery in the region would assist others who may face the same issues? Ms. Briseno. Well, as an organization, Colorado Military Survivors, is a new non-profit here in Colorado Springs. We have encountered many new surviving families in this area. And our hope is to advocate for those that need to be closer in order to process their grief. And I think my experience with widows and family members in this area show that we're--we're coming to the understanding that it's important to be closer, to face the challenges, especially as younger widows. We have additional challenges, with the complications of losing our loved one, that was active duty especially. I think that families, we can encourage families and support them in their grieving process and to continue to move on and show how much we appreciate what they've done by giving them access to a place that they can move forward in their grief. Mr. Hall. Thank you very much. Mr. Lamborn, you're now recognized for questions. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you both for your eloquent and moving testimony. Ms. Briseno, you mentioned that your family tries to go to Fort Logan at least on Memorial Day, if not more often. Can you ever think of examples with yourself, or other people that you worked with through the Military Survivors Organization that you're working so much with, where trips have had to be postponed or canceled because of this changeable weather? The weather we have here today and yesterday is a perfect example of how our volatile weather can change plans. Ms. Briseno. Well, personally, my husband died on September 28, 2005. Our 14th wedding anniversary was November 30th. I was bound and determined, because it takes a while to get the permanent headstone up, I had gotten word that his headstone had been placed. So I had not visited Fort Logan since his interment on the 28th of September, and that--the day before, it was predicted that there was going to be snow. My family and I were living with my in-laws. And my mother- in-law was terrified that I was going to try and make it up there the next day, because I was bound and determined to visit his grave on our anniversary. And due to the weather, and also a little minor accident with my daughter at school on the day of our anniversary, I decided it was probably not a good day to go. And my mother-in-law was quite relieved that I did not try and trek up there by myself. I insisted on going by myself, because it was that personal time that you need and don't want to show it in front of everybody. And I think that that--I decided not to go that day. So I had to decide other ways to commemorate the day, without going to his grave site. So that postponed my first visit. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. And for either one of you, you talked about a mother with small children. On the other end of the scale, someone, a widow or widower for that matter who is elderly, do you know of special needs there that might make it difficult to go from this part of the State to Fort Logan. Ms. Lee-Witt. Well, I deal with a lot of the older widows, Vietnam and World War II era. And many of them are in walkers. They are afraid to drive in a metropolitan area. They hate going over Monument Hill. We have a lot of accidents on Monument Hill. A lot of them are too sick to drive or they're too afraid to drive anywhere but their little neighborhoods. So for them, yes, they have to depend on someone else if they're going to go. I hate to--I'm not that old, but I hate to drive in Denver too. So, yes, that's a big issue with the older widows, and a lot of them have their spouses at Fort Logan. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you both. Mr. Hall. Thanks, Mr. Lamborn. Mr. Salazar. Mr. Salazar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was very moving testimony, and my heart goes out to you and your families. The legislation that we currently have in the House, actually, is stuck in the Senate, does several things. First of all, it establishes a national cemetery in the southern Colorado region, and also requires the Secretary to establish a national cemetery in this county, in El Paso County. It requires the Secretary to consult with State and local officials as to the site selection, and it requires a Secretary to consult with government officials in the site selection. It authorizes the Secretary to accept the gift of an appropriate parcel of real estate to be used for the cemetery, and it requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the establishment of the cemetery. It requires the Secretary to add the cemetery to the current list of priority projects. As you know, there are six cemeteries on the priority list. This will not circumvent any of those. It falls in line, it would be number seven. Under Secretary Tuerk, I hope, he agrees with that. It does not allow the cemetery to take priority over any of these current projects. Do you have any objections to any of these proposals, and would you have any objections if the cemetery was selected closer to the Pueblo line, as it might be able to serve more veterans and would cover a greater geographical area that would serve veterans in southeast and southwest Colorado. Would either one of you or both of you address that? Ms. Lee-Witt. Since Fort Carson is the--where they're expanding so much, the southern part of El Paso County would be fine with me, and between Pueblo and the Springs, I think would be appropriate. I think if it's in Pueblo or south of there, it's going to still be just as hard for the El Paso County widows and families. Mr. Salazar. This does designate that El Paso County will be the home. Ms. Lee-Witt. Okay. Mr. Salazar. We wanted to try to move it closer to the Pueblo County line, still in the El Paso County so that it would be able to serve more veterans, and I think that maybe we could find an appropriate gift of land in that area. Ms. Lee-Witt. I wouldn't have any objection to that, as long as it's not going over Monument Hill or having to be the-- -- Mr. Salazar. It's warmer down south. Ms. Briseno. I think traveling aspect, that's probably the main concern, is that it would be accessible, even if the weather was a bit rough, just because--and then being less congested. It was hard to find Fort Logan the first time I went, and I think it would be easier for families that have even more complications in travelling, any families of any age, because it would be more accessible, and probably a calmer, quieter place for one to face their grief. Mr. Salazar. Would either one of you possibly think of disinterring the remains of your loved ones, and if we had an actual cemetery close by, bring the remains to this area? Ms. Lee-Witt. I would definitely consider that for my family. Ms. Briseno. When I talked with my in-laws, my father and mother-in-law, my sister-in-laws, even with my children, my oldest one being 12, that was everybody's first question, is whether we would do that. And I think for my in-laws, because of being parents and facing additional health issues and concerns, travel is hard for them. And we know several families in the Pueblo area of parents that, due to their age, it makes it difficult. And so that was the concern of my in-laws was if they would--if that would be a possibility for our family. Mr. Salazar. Thank you both very much. Thank you for your sacrifice. Ms. Lee-Witt. I'd like to add to that too. I did say that all my children and grandchildren are here now, and because my husband's body is in Tennessee, that also is where I will be buried. And that would be a hardship, at that point, for all of my family. So I would definitely consider that. Mr. Salazar. Thank you. Mr. Hall. Thank you, Ms. Lee-Witt and Ms. Briseno. And having spent a bit of my life making music in Tennessee, I can tell you that Nashville is a wonderful town. I would encourage you, if circumstances allow, to make the trip. Thanks again for your testimony, and you're now excused. We will call our second panel: Mr. Victor Fernandez, Co- Founder of the Pikes Peak Veterans Cemetery Committee; Mr. Bud Sailar, Director of El Paso County Board of Veterans; Mr. C. Douglas Sterner, Former Chairman of the Colorado State Board of Veterans Affairs; and Mr. Jeff Chostner, Pueblo County Commissioner; and Tim Grabin, Department Commander of the American Legion. As before, your written statements are in the record. So feel free to confine yourselves to 5 minutes. The yellow light means 4 minutes, and the red light means 5. So, Mr. Fernandez, you are now recognized. STATEMENTS OF VICTOR M. FERNANDEZ, MEMBER, PIKES PEAK VETERANS CEMETERY COMMITTEE, COLORADO SPRINGS, CO; BUD SAILAR, DIRECTOR, EL PASO COUNTY, CO, VETERAN AND MILITARY AFFAIRS; TIM GRABIN, DEPARTMENT COMMANDER, DEPARTMENT OF COLORADO, AMERICAN LEGION; C. DOUGLAS STERNER, PAST CHAIRMAN, COLORADO STATE BOARD OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; AND HON. JEFF CHOSTNER, COLONEL, USAF (RET.), COMMISSIONER, PUEBLO COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, PUEBLO, CO STATEMENT OF VICTOR M. FERNANDEZ Mr. Fernandez. Good afternoon. I'm Vic Fernandez, and I'm West Point Class 1959, and I was born in Trinidad, Colorado, where my World War II veteran father was intered--or is intered. I am a member of the Pikes Peak Veterans Cemetery Committee. Thank you very much for coming to Colorado to hear our message. I'll cover three issues. First, why we need a new national veterans cemetery in Colorado. Second, why it should be established in the Pikes Peak region. And third, what we have done to assure that it is established here. Regarding the first issue, Fort Logan in Denver, the State's major national veterans cemetery is expected to reach capacity about 2020. Fort Logan National Cemetery is landlocked in a residential area of Denver and cannot be expanded. Because of the size, geography, and weather patterns of the State of Colorado, the State's other small, remotely located cemeteries do not offer reasonable service to Denver or the Pikes Peak region. Those are reasons why it should be in the Pikes Peak region, and that's all southern Colorado. First, the large veteran population of the Pikes Peak region has not been properly served by Fort Logan. Fort Logan is located in a difficult to find residential section of a major metropolitan area, with poor access from interstate and/ or other highways. This has resulted in surviving spouses and families from southern Colorado making the trip to visit the loved one, but failing to find the cemetery. Second, in winter, it is especially difficult to get to Denver over the topography of Monument Hill and through the weather patterns of what we call the Palmer Divide. Those topographic and weather pattern's hindrances make the Veterans Administration's internal 75-mile rule a useless tool in the State of Colorado, resulting in unsatisfactory service to veterans and their families in southern Colorado. Third, the Pikes Peak region, with its rapidly growing six military installations is producing veterans at a much faster rate than the remainder of the State of Colorado. Many local military complete their service and remain in this area. Additionally, hundreds of our local military have given their lives during the global war on terror, and were buried in our local cemeteries, these active duty Americans need to be counted and properly served by a local national veterans cemetery. And finally, the service life of Fort Logan can be lengthened for the veterans of Denver in the northern--in northern Colorado if the Pikes Peak cemetery is established and opens soon. So what have we done to assure that a national cemetery is established in the Pikes Peak region? My colleagues and I have worked for the establishment of this cemetery for over 10 years. Politically, we have solicited and received the backing of past, as was mentioned, and present Members of Congress. We have the backing of all of the Colorado contingent in the Congress of the United States. We have the backing of county commissioners and city councils from several counties and cities in southern Colorado, including Pueblo and Colorado Springs. We are supported by all of the veterans organizations in the surrounding counties, and the United Veterans Council of Colorado, Committee of Colorado. We have made several contacts with and have carried on letter-writing campaigns to the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs for over these past 10 years. To date, we do not consider any of the responses to have been satisfactory. We studied the VA regulations. We performed due diligence studies. We have written a comprehensive plan, and that plan is entitled, ``A National Veterans Cemetery for the Pikes Peak Region.'' This is that plan. I will give a copy of this to each of you. The plan contains color maps, the photos of 10 most viable low and no- cost undeveloped sites between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, and a matrix that we use to rank these 10 sites. In conclusion, in order to provide sufficient burial space for Colorado's veterans in the future, and to fairly meet the needs of southern Colorado's veterans, plans for Pikes Peak Veterans Cemetery must get under way immediately, and we are prepared to help. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Fernandez appears on p. 47.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, sir. And, without objection, I will ask that the report you're giving us be entered into the record of this hearing. [The report entitled, ``A National Veterans Cemetery for the Pikes Peak Region,'' appears on p. 63.] Mr. Hall. Mr. Sailar. STATEMENT OF BUD SAILAR Mr. Sailar. Good afternoon, Congressman. My name is Bud Sailar, and I am the Director of El Paso County Veteran Military Affairs Office. I thank you for the opportunity to testify and present the views of our local veterans and their concerns. Like many, we consider the national cemeteries as memorials to veterans who preserved our freedom. The future veteran demographics of Colorado will show that the Pikes Peak region, with its military installations, are producing veterans at a much faster rate than the remainder of Colorado. Fort Carson, which is the most popular station of choice, is alone on track to go to a population of over 30,000 soldiers, not counting their spouses. And when many, if not most of these local military complete their service, they remain in the area, which further accelerates the growth of the veteran population here. We also find that a large number of military, who were once stationed here, return here after military retirement. In short, our veteran population is growing at a much faster rate than the remainder of Colorado. I myself am a native of Pennsylvania. And when I completed my service at the Air Force Academy, I chose to stay here. And my family's here, and I've had 26 years living in this area. Additionally, we find that it is interesting and very disappointing that our large active duty military population is not counted in the veteran population numbers used to determine population served by national cemeteries. Presently, over 100 burials per week take place at Fort Logan. During the next 22 years, according to VA data, there will be an additional 40,000 veterans in southern Colorado. Many of these will not be honored in the national cemetery because, in that same 22-year period, over 90,000 veterans will be buried at Fort Logan. This will more than tax the cemetery usage. One of the things that I find really disappointing, or disheartening is in talking to surviving spouses, I find that a lot of the surviving spouses have their spouses' remains in urns on a shelf in their home. I recently spoke to one widow, and Ms. Witt referred to it earlier, that she did not want to have her family or her husband buried at Fort Logan because of her age, and that she could not travel there. And it makes it very difficult on those individuals. So it is really disheartening to our staff that we see so many surviving spouses that have to hold their loved one's remains instead of being able to make a decision right away, and alleviate some of the pain that they have because they've already lost the loved one. Mr. Chairman, I wish you and Under Secretary Tuerk could have arrived in Denver yesterday morning and traveled down I- 25. You would have had a perfect example of the weather conditions here and what families have to put up with. And it would have been a firsthand experience seeing what was going on. And again, we thank you for coming here. We feel this is a very important issue, and that it really needs addressing, especially in thanking the numbers of veterans and their families that have served this country, and especially the numbers of the younger veterans that we're losing because of the war on terror. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sailar appears on p. 49.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Sailar. I can tell you that Under Secretary Tuerk did, in fact, arrive yesterday. I chickened out. But he tells us that he made the drive and it was truly awful and dangerous. You'll hear from him in a little while, but thank you for your testimony. Mr. Grabin, you're recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF TIM GRABIN Mr. Grabin. Mr. Chairman, Members of Subcommittee, Honorable Congressmen John Hall, Doug Lamborn and John Salazar, I am a native. My name is Tim Grabin, the Department Commander of the Colorado American Legion. I am a native of Canon City, Colorado, which is southern Colorado, a long history of family who have honorably served over many generations. During Word War II, I lost an uncle who was killed in action, and he is buried there in Canon City, and perhaps that is the reason he is buried there rather than Fort Logan due to some of the transportation situations and crossing the mountains. It is some complication. I would like to thank you for allowing the American Legion, the Department of Colorado, to present its views on the VA cemetery construction policy. I've endorsed a copy of the resolution adopted by our National organization. As part of my written testimony, this remains our current position on burial allowances. Burial plots, allowances and establishment of additional, national and State cemeteries. I would like to concentrate my remarks on the need for additional cemetery space in Colorado. And hopefully, in the Colorado Springs area, serving veterans in southern parts of Colorado and other areas. Colorado continues to grow, and new veterans and their families are a part of that growth. Historically, because of numerous military establishments in the southern Colorado area, veterans return to Colorado, making Colorado their new home because of climate, environment, and strong military support systems in place. With the new veterans population growth, will come the need for new cemeteries. Space for southern Colorado area is the perfect place for a new cemetery. As the Department Commander of the American Legion, I would like to put our organization on record as favoring the establishment of a new--a brand new cemetery in southern Colorado. And we would not favor the Fort Logan satellite concept. For instance, during our winters in Colorado, on many occasions Colorado Springs is separated and isolated from Denver because of inclement weather on Monument Hill. To count on Fort Logan establishment to provide support services during those times would possibly delay counsel, the services for those being intered. All support services must be co-located within the new cemetery. We are adamant that the location of the south of Monument Hill and located so that the maximum number of veterans be served. We want to thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to express our views. We want to continue to be a part of the discussion and decisionmaking. We stand ready, as an organization of over 2.7 million veterans, nationwide, to put our strong voice behind the efforts. Thank you for the privilege to serve here today for veterans on this day. [The prepared statement of Mr. Grabin appears on p. 50.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Grabin. Mr. Sterner, you're recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF C. DOUGLAS STERNER Mr. Sterner. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity. On February 4, 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, Army Private Harold D. Hissong was killed in action. On learning of his death half a world away in the small town of Somers, Montana, his mother, Florence Hissong planted a tree at the front entrance of her home, overlooking Flathead Lake. Five years later, I was born in nearby Kalispell. And in many ways, I grew up alongside that tree, for I could not miss it every time I visited my grandmother. As a growing boy, each time I saw it, it stood as a reminder, not only of the uncle that I never knew, but of the great price of freedom, of the responsibility passed on to every generation to answer its own call of duty. And when my day came, I understood my obligation was privileged to serve my Nation through two tours of duty in Vietnam. I was in no small part inspired by the lessons learned from a tree planted in honor of a World War II hero. Mr. Hall. Excuse me, Mr. Sterner. Is your microphone on? Is there a switch? Why don't you switch with Mr. Grabin? Thank you. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Mr. Sterner. Thank you. I am--from good to worse. Mr. Hall. Whoever has the knob, turn it down a little bit and we'll be fine. Mr. Sterner. I have come to learn and understand that memorials are not about those who went before us. Rather, memorials stand as an example as a beacon to inspire and guide future generations of Americans. The location of our veterans cemeteries is not so much about the convenience with which we place our dead, as it is about the convenience that we offer to the families who have lost a loved one, and are reminded and inspired by the monuments to their selfless service. The ethos of a warrior states, ``I will never leave a comrade behind.'' And no matter where in the world a young man or woman falls in service to their country, they know that their comrades will do everything in their power to see that they are returned home. This ethos is not predicated upon policies established within constraints of budgets and convenience. It is a solemn obligation to those who've served and have sacrificed. As a nation, we have no less a solemn obligation to ensure that the final resting place of our veterans be in close proximity to their home. Fifteen years ago, my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado, was recognized by the U.S. Congress as America's Home of Heroes due to the fact that it was the only city in America with four sons who are living recipients of the medal of honor. It should not be surprising that Pueblo would produce four such heroes over three different wars in a span of only 24 years. Pueblo is Home of Heroes because of these four, but also because of thousands others like them who have served with pride and patriotism. In the 2000 census, Pueblo numbered among the top 254 largest cities in America, number five with the largest percentage of World War II veterans. Such dedication to service is endemic to our community, and our community believes strongly in duty, honor and country. Eight years ago, two of our hometown heroes died within months of each other. Bill Crawford, who earned the Medal of Honor in World War II was buried at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Carl Sitter, Bill's high school classmate who earned a Silver Star in World War II and the Medal of Honor in Korea was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On April 6, 2007, Jerry Murphy passed away, the third Puebloan in less than 10 years to earn the Medal of Honor when he received it for his actions in Korea. Although funeral services were held in his hometown, he was subsequently transported far south to Santa Fe National Cemetery for burial. You see, there exists today no veterans cemetery within 90 miles of Pueblo that ensures that Mr. Murphy, or for that matter, Mr. Crawford or Mr. Sitter could have returned home for their final journey. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, the VA cemetery construction policy failed these three distinguished heroes of my hometown, as well as the people of Pueblo who remembered them fondly. It continues to fail the families of our city of 100,000 citizens, comprising one of the highest percentages of World War II veterans in the Nation, and in fact a uniquely high percentage of veterans of all recent wars who must travel more than 100 miles and navigate the traffic of metropolitan Denver just to pay respect to their loved ones buried at Fort Logan. Please consider the needs of our city as well as the entire southern Colorado region, remembering our obligation as a Nation to our veterans and to their families, and provide the much needed national cemetery in our area so our heroes will rest in peace and dignity where they belong: at home in southern Colorado. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sterner appears on p. 51.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Sterner. Colonel Chostner. STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF CHOSTNER, COLONEL, USAF (RET.) Colonel Chostner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Congressman Lamborn and Congressman Salazar for having us here today. I've been involved with this matter since 2003 as a former member of the Pueblo Colorado City Council, as Chairman of the Greater Pueblo Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Committee, as President of the Air Force Association, Mel Harmon Chapter, and the American Legion. I served 22 years on active duty. I retired as a colonel in the United States Air Force, and I'm currently a Pueblo County Commissioner. This matter is near and dear to my heart, and I'm sure to my other colleagues because we've had other friends who have fallen in combat. And we need to dedicate their service to this country in an appropriate way where we can lay their remains. In April 1986, I was promoted to the grade of major with my fellow Mayor, Fernando Ribbas Dominici. Two weeks later, he was killed over the skies of Tripoli as the last 111 that went in over that particular city. In 1991, my wing deployed during operation Desert Storm, the Island of Diego Garcia. My wing, the 92nd bomb wing, was the only wing to lose a B52 during combat, and I lost friends on that particular aircraft as well. It's my view that it is imperative that a new veterans cemetery be established in southern Colorado. And by that, I mean in a location south of the city of Colorado Springs. As you know, the closest veterans cemetery is Fort Logan National Cemetery. It's located in the Denver metro area. It's a fine facility, and one of which we're all proud. I have two relatives who lay in that cemetery. However, it's my understanding that Fort Logan is nearing capacity, and there's a pressing need to establish another veterans cemetery, either as an adjunct of Fort Logan, or as a new cemetery. I've also been informed that there are different Veterans Administration regulations, based on the status of the cemetery. Under either criteria, however, we were dismayed to learn that the Veterans Administration has recommended a veterans cemetery between Colorado Springs and Denver. None of the participants to the discussions that I've been involved with over the last 5 years ever envisioned a cemetery north of Colorado Springs. All believe it should be south of Colorado Springs. I would urge that you review the current Veterans Administration regulations regarding status of veterans cemeteries and how said cemeteries define the geographical area in which they may be placed. In my view, the current regulations do not sufficiently take into account location of other existing veteran cemeteries, and the ability of other concentrations of veterans to avail themselves of the right to burial in the national cemetery. This discrepancy is most apparent in the matter before your Subcommittee, in that, as Mr. Sterner mentioned, the next closest veterans cemetery is Santa Fe, New Mexico. If you dealt just strictly in geographical terms, a new cemetery should probably be close to Trinidad, Colorado, but given the concentration of the veterans, we all came to a consensus that it should be at a location south of Colorado Springs. Yet, instead of proposing a cemetery that would either be more geographically central to the area or closer for other veterans in the region, the Veterans Administration recommends a new cemetery in close proximity to the existing one. While it will provide more capacity, it does not allow more convenience or availability to the region's veterans or their families. I appreciate the ability to speak before you today, and I would urge that you alter the regulations. Thank you very much. And, Congressman Salazar, as a fellow veteran, I would also thank you for your service to the United States. [The prepared statement of Colonel Chostner appears on p. 59.] Mr. Hall. Thank you, Colonel Chostner. Thank you all for your testimony, for your service to our country, and for your service to our veterans. Mr. Fernandez, I'll start off by asking you, in your testimony, you showed us and told us about the plan in National Veterans Cemetery for the Pikes Peak region, which we've entered into the record here. Have you received any feedback on this plan, and do you think plans such as yours would serve as a good example for the creation of future veterans cemeteries in other locations? Mr. Fernandez. Yes, sir, we have received feedback on it. We've received feedback from both Senators' offices, Senator Salazar and Senator Allard. We have received feedback from Congressman Salazar, of course Congressman Lamborn, and you received testimony today from Congressman Udall. He is also back. Several others have said that. This sort of a thing actually didn't come about by accident. My second career, after I finished playing soldier, was as an urban planner. And I realize the importance of urban planning to get anything done. We--I reached out to a fellow that I had worked with. His name is George Calhoun. He's a retired West Point officer, class of 1954, and he was the actual author of this. We on the Committee provided the data, photographs and maps that he would need to produce this document, and it was produced therefore by him, approved after some slight modifications by the Committee. It does have 10 sites, and those 10 sites are in the County--we have one site in Pueblo County, one site in Fremont County and the others are in El Paso County, and they are all between Colorado Springs and Pueblo, with the exception of one site that is east of Colorado Springs, near Schriever Air Force Base. That particular site was offered early on, and it is a good site, but doesn't meet the between the cities kind of thing. Mr. Hall. Thank you, sir. I have 5 minutes total. Mr. Salazar. Mr. Chairman, may I request that this booklet be handed out so that we can look at those? Mr. Hall. Sure, that would be great. Thank you so much. We'll read the report and get back to you with more questions. Thank you for your response. Also, I wanted to ask Mr. Sailar, in your testimony, you mentioned that 400 active duty servicemembers who were stationed in Colorado have died serving this Nation over the last several years, but some were buried in their hometowns. Can you tell the Subcommittee why these veterans should be counted in the numbers for a local cemetery? Mr. Sailar. Because, sir, they have become a large part of this community and this county, and a lot of these veterans that were buried in other areas not only lost their lives during conflict, a lot of them passed away due to the injuries that they sustained in combat. So they were not counted as direct combat fatalities. This is important. We are finding more and more, especially from Fort Carson, there are individuals remaining in El Paso County and the Pikes Peak region. After their service, they come back here or they just stay here. Mr. Hall. So you think a significant number of the 400 would have--their families would have chosen to have them buried in a cemetery in southern Colorado, were there one in existence. Mr. Sailar. Without a doubt, sir. Mr. Hall. Thank you. Mr. Grabin, how does the Fort Logan cemetery system currently handle inclement weather? Do they cancel interments? Do they have adequate indoor facilities for services? Mr. Grabin. As far as--I believe they do have indoor, as far as Fort Logan. I'm not as privy at this time to give that report. But I know, as far as southern Colorado, when the weather is bad, and they do close Monument Hill, we are not able to get over Monument Hill, even if you had a four-wheel drive, there are days, a four-wheel drive hearse, you would not be able to get over that hill. Mr. Hall. Thank you, sir. That red light is for me, and I'm going to yield to Mr. Lamborn. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Fernandez, you heard from the testimony of the two widows earlier, and they talked about sometimes there are great difficulties in going from here to Fort Logan. You heard their testimony. Is there anything you could add to what they said about that particular situation? Mr. Fernandez. Yes, sir, I'll add two things. First of all, we did have a friend of ours pass away in December. His name was Colonel Bill Carnahan. Bill passed away about the 14th of December. And because of the weather patterns and topography, he was not able to be buried at Fort Logan until mid-January. That's item number one. Item number two, I know of at least a dozen families who presently have the ashes of their folks, if you will, on the shelf waiting because they want the cemetery so that they can put them in a proper veteran--national veterans cemetery here in the Springs or nearby. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. Mr. Sailar, I was talking to a young Army captain last night, and he said that Fort Carson is maybe the most popular place to be stationed in the Army. If it's not the most, it's right up at the top. With that in mind, will that kind of reputation make the Pikes Peak area--make the numbers of veterans here accelerate more in the future as people rotate in on active duty or come here, possibly, after retirement? Mr. Sailar. Sir, your statement is exactly right. I have friends that actually were never stationed in the Pikes Peak region, and in having spoken to them, and told them about the area, they've come out and visited me. They have moved here. And others are planning to move here. So this situation is not just for ones that are stationed here. They are coming back here because they like the area so much and the community is a large veterans supportive community. There are individuals moving here. Myself and my colleague, Mr. Tackett, belong to the National Association of Veterans Service Officers, and we have contacts all over the country. And we get calls from veterans--in fact, I got calls just last month from a veteran in Florida that is moving to Colorado, who wanted to know what the veteran support system was here, because he's moving here to be with his family. His wife had passed away, and so he's going to move here to live with his daughter and her husband. And we're seeing more and more of this, older retirees and veterans moving into the area to live with families. My father-in-law, he and his wife, he is an ace from World War II, P-38 pilot. He's 88 years old, and we moved them here from Kansas. So hopefully it doesn't come soon, but when the time comes, there will be a national cemetery here because all of his relatives, my wife and his daughter all live in this area. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. Another question for you, Mr. Sailar. You said that the VA's numbers do not include active-duty military. Could you do a quick rough calculation for us on if you did include active- duty military and if you included dependents, how would those numbers change for the Pikes Peak area? Mr. Sailar. Well, just to give you a quick thing, on Fort Carson, alone, over the next couple of years, they expect over 30,000 active-duty members to be stationed at Fort Carson. I've heard that there's going to be some other units coming in too. That doesn't count another 45,000 dependents. Now, there are spouses that are eligible to be buried along with their veteran spouse in a national cemetery. There are also children that can be qualified to be buried in the national cemetery with their father or mother if either parent is a veteran. So these numbers, like I mentioned earlier, from the VA data itself project over 125,000 veterans will pass away along the front rage between now and 2030. That doesn't count spouses. That doesn't count other individuals moving into the area. So those numbers could double very easily. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. And one last question, before my time is up. Mr. Grabin, you heard what was said about the desire for people in Pueblo. We heard from a County Commissioner, for instance, and Mr. Sterner as well. Would those same feelings be echoed by the folks that you know where you live in Canon City, which is probably about the same distance, but in a slightly different direction? Mr. Grabin. A little different angle. I would personally like to share this portion as a representative of the American Legion in answering that: ``As to the exact location, we will leave that decision to the planners to determine the best location that will meet all the provisions of the law and the requirements for growth, space to provide the absolute best setting in terms of view, landscape, serenity for the final resting spot for America's veterans. But we are adamant that the location be south of Monument Hill, located so that the maximum number of veterans be served.'' That would be El Paso County. Mr. Lamborn. Thank you. Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Lamborn. Mr. Salazar. Mr. Salazar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All of you are aware of the proposed sites for the cemeteries, correct? Have all of you been? Is there any preference? And I'd like each one of you to answer that, starting with Colonel Chostner, if you will. Colonel Chostner. I prefer the one that is further south. I'm not sure exactly what the name of it is. I'd have to look at it. I'm not sure of the exact name of it. Mr. Sterner can refer to that. If I could mention, though, Congressman, there are 16,000 veterans in Pueblo County. And if you look at the veterans in Fremont County, El Paso County, and Teller County, you're looking at a significant number of veterans themselves. So in response to your question, Congressman Lamborn, there's a significant population south of the El Paso County line that have availed themselves of a cemetery, hence my recommendation that it be as far south as possible. One last thing, Congressman, with regard to the inclement weather. I mentioned I had two relatives that were buried in Fort Logan. The last one I did was in January of 2003. That ceremony was almost canceled because of the weather. And secondly, it was held outside, which was not the most appropriate way to commemorate that individual. Mr. Salazar. You are aware that the legislation that is being proposed that we actually passed includes the 29 counties of southern Colorado in order to be able to meet the 150,000 veteran threshold. And that is why we thought that it would be better to be south of Colorado Springs so that we could address all of southern Colorado. Mr. Sterner. Mr. Sterner. Yes, Congressman Salazar, and thank you for all your great work on behalf of veterans over the years. I've done some markups on this. I'd like to point out a couple of things. First of all, in the 29 counties that were identified in H.R. 1660, the Rio Grande County was not listed, and yet it falls within that area, bringing in another 3,000 veterans. Also locating the cemetery somewhere in El Paso County, or in that vicinity, while it would--Chaffee County and Park County are not counted as part of the southern Colorado region, but they do fall within the attachment area. Park County population is 19.2 percent veterans, one of the highest in the Nation. Chaffee County's population is 17.1 percent. So now we're talking even outside a region of numbers well in excess of the 150,000. I have done a series of documents that I would be happy to present to the Committee showing five different locations, ranging from the proposed Douglas County option, which I find unacceptable, to my hometown of Pueblo. Frankly, I find Florence is a very, very attractive area, or in that near area between the Fremont-El Paso County line. We've got open area there. It falls well in attachment area for Colorado Springs, for Canon City, for Westcliffe, for Pueblo, and the surrounding areas. That would be my personal preference. Mr. Salazar. Mr. Grabin. Mr. Grabin. I don't truly have a personal preference. I want to stay more neutral. I do think that south of Monument, up around the Air Academy, is the most beautiful as far as its scenery. Down toward the old racetrack, south of Colorado Springs, while we have easily accessible, I think that's a very good location. And I'm not so sure as far as out toward Fort Carson, just how that would work, but I think that's something to consider as well. Mr. Salazar. The old dog track area---- Mr. Grabin. Well, the racetrack. Mr. Salazar. The racetrack, okay. There is actually property there, a sufficient amount. Is it 500 acres. Is that correct, Mr. Fernandez? Mr. Fernandez. The Pikes Peak International Raceway portion of that had been sold, and so therefore it's not available. But there are sites on either side of I-25 that are public property. They are property of Colorado Springs Utilities, and there is sufficient acreage, approximately 250 acres, and one in close to almost 300 acres in the other that would be satisfactory. Mr. Salazar. And is your preference closer to the Pueblo line or somewhere in that neighborhood south of Fort Carson? Mr. Fernandez. Sir, I'm going to have to remain neutral also, but I would like to bring to your attention Figure---- Mr. Salazar. You sound like a Congressman. Mr. Fernandez [continuing]. Figure 4.1. Under figure 4.1, we did rate these things, and we rated them by availability of water, accessibility, acreage, land ownership, topography, aesthetics, and feasibility. And the top sites were the Cheyenne Mountain State Park site, which is actually on Highway 115. Second was the Cane Ranch, which is free property to us. Mr. Salazar. And that was my next question. Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up, but can I just have another couple minutes? Thank you, sir. The Cane Ranch, for example, isn't it the owner, if I am correct, he has agreed to actually donate the property? Mr. Fernandez. He has done so. The property is now in the hands and holding by El Paso County. Mr. Salazar. And that is which proposed site? Mr. Fernandez. That is proposed site--it's called Cane Ranch. If you'll take a look at Figure 4.1, you'll see that rated 31 points in our booklet. Mr. Salazar. And that is exactly--oh, that's south of Fort Carson. Mr. Fernandez. It's actually outside--it's outside of gate 1, on Highway 115, across--oh, the Cane Ranch, no. Cane Ranch is in Fountain. It's in Fountain. Mr. Salazar. Well, Mr. Sailar---- Mr. Fernandez. It's south of Colorado Springs. Mr. Salazar. Mr. Sailar, do you have any objection to that site, or is that your preferred? Mr. Sailar. Sir, in speaking to a lot of veterans in our community, they want it in southern Colorado, and I have heard them say anywhere other than over Monument Hill; Right on the border line between Pueblo and Colorado Springs is very preferable to everyone that I have spoken to. And I really don't believe any member of any committee that I am a member of, would object to that. If that was the area that was going to be picked, that would be very pleasing to all of the members of our military community and their families. Mr. Salazar. Thank you very much. And I just want to--just a quick comment. Mr. Sterner, thank you very much for helping to author the Stolen Valor Act, which the President signed into law last year. We really appreciate that. Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Salazar. Thank you, all on our second panel, for your testimony and for your service to our country and to our veterans. And we're now going to take a recess of about 3 minutes and then come back. [Recess.] Mr. Hall. The Subcommittee will return from recess and come to order. And our third panelist is Under Secretary William Tuerk, Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, National Cemetery Administration (NCA), for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. And your entire statement, of course, is in the record, as you know, having done many of these affairs. And you're recognized now for your testimony. STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM F. TUERK, UNDER SECRETARY FOR MEMORIAL AFFAIRS, NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Mr. Tuerk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. And you anticipated my first request, and that is to submit my statement and have it printed in the record. I don't propose to read it to you. You and the visitors here who are in attendance have copies of my testimony, and it's available, and you can read it. So I'll summarize some of the points raised in that testimony, and perhaps amplify some other points, particularly in light of some of the comments that I've heard. I commend you and I commend the staff for your foresight in making me last, and not first witness. It was useful to hear the prior testimony before giving my own, and I appreciated that opportunity. Surely I was going to stay and listen to the testimony of the witnesses that came after me, but I'm glad I had a chance to hear them before I offered this testimony. If I may, just a couple things before I start. First, to Ms. Briseno and Ms. Lee-Witt, I want to thank you both for your husbands' service to our Nation. I'm sure I speak for everyone in the room--the members of the panel have already spoken for themselves in expressing our appreciation for the service that your families have rendered. I don't know if it's appropriate to do this, but I'm going to do it as just a personal note. To both of you ladies, I can tell you, I understand from personal experience your grief, your situation. I understand from personal experience the comfort one can get from visiting one's spouse's gravesite, and I wish that your spouses' gravesites were more convenient for you. I hope they will become more convenient for you. Again, I would suggest to you, Ms. Lee-Witt, that when we build a cemetery here in Colorado, you certainly ought to consider having your husband's remains reinterred up here. I can tell you, I have been to the Nashville National Cemetery, and it's an extraordinary site, a very historic site dating to 1862. I happened to be there at an event commemorating the burials of what are called, in sort of arcane language, U.S. Colored Troops, African American citizens of the north who fell to preserve the union. Many hundreds of them are buried in Nashville; it is a very interesting and historic site. Believe me, your husband is in a place of honor there. Now, if I may, and I'm going to try and do this as quickly as I can. But some of these points, I think, bear some amplification. First, I'd like to talk just a little bit about the background of NCA and what we're tying to accomplish now--what this formula that's been cited, imperfect though it be. Right now we are engaged in the largest expansion in the national cemetery system since the Civil War. In a course of about 10 years, we will have opened 17 new national cemeteries and over 40 State cemeteries. Our goal is to provide services to more veterans than are currently served. Our tactic, and we've been directed by Congress to pursue this tactic, is to identify the areas with the largest populations of unserved veterans and locate new cemeteries there. Consistent with that approach, we have, in the last several years, opened up cemeteries in major, major metropolitan areas, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Dallas, Seattle, Pittsburgh, Miami. We are on target, right now, to open up cemeteries in other large cities, Sarasota, Philadelphia, other sites. This is not to say that the people of Colorado Springs are served as well as we like or are adequately served. It's a matter of ranking priorities. Chicago, for example, when we decided to build a cemetery there, had 991,000 veterans living within 75 miles of Chicago, veterans who were unserved. Sites that remain to be served don't have numbers quite that dramatic, but I want to make the point that our prioritizing system has attempted to locate the Federal dollars and to locate the facilities where we can do the most good for the most people. I do understand there are unserved veterans who are not in proximity, even by our standard, to Fort Logan National Cemetery. By our reckoning, about 27,000 veterans live beyond the 75-mile ring from Fort Logan. And I understand reasonable people can differ on whether that's an intelligent standard or not. But by that standard, just for perspective, there are many other cities with many more unserved veterans that have yet to have the benefit of a national cemetery, In Charleston, West Virginia, for example, there are 154,000 veterans who have no burial option within 75 miles. The nearest national cemetery to the people of Charleston, West Virginia, is West Virginia National Cemetery, 142 miles away, over very difficult West Virginia terrain. Similarly, in the Chairman's home State, in Buffalo, New York, there are 144,000 veterans living within 75 miles of Buffalo who have no burial option at all. The nearest national cemetery to Buffalo is 105 miles away, in Bath, New York, in south central New York. As in West Virginia, there is difficult mountainous terrain to traverse between Buffalo and Bath. I don't offer this except for perspective on where our standards have led us. I've heard much discussion about the imperfections in that standard, and I recognize there are imperfections in that standard. We know it is imperfect. We have asked a contractor to analyze that standard critically and to perform many other forward-looking activities for us. So that standard perhaps might be changed. But one point I want to make to this community is that, heretofore, we have been less than encouraging to this community using that standard because we took into account the fact that Fort Logan was operating just 59 miles north of here. We have, however, reassessed the situation in light of one inescapable fact that's already been cited to you. Fort Logan National Cemetery is now interring veterans in its last active area. As one of the witnesses testified, it is landlocked. We cannot acquire land contiguous to Fort Logan. It is going to close, it must close. We estimate now that in 2019, plus or minus 1 or 2 years, that cemetery is going to close. And as I have discussed with your delegation, we are looking at the situation of cemetery service on the front range in a new way now. We are assessing the situation with the assumption that after 2019 there will no longer be a cemetery in Denver. Looked at from that point of view, if one doesn't take into account the presence of a cemetery in Denver, we see that there are some 285,000 veterans in the Denver-Colorado Springs-Pueblo area who will be unserved the day that cemetery closes. By our standard, 170,000 unserved veterans within 75 miles qualifies a location for a new cemetery. Clearly, the front range in Colorado would merit a new cemetery under that standard. And I'm here to tell you, we are proceeding on the assumption that there will be a new cemetery to be located here, a cemetery that will succeed Fort Logan, and I'll get into details about that in just a second. But we are no longer of the view that this community should not get a cemetery. We are committed to the idea that a cemetery ought to come here. Now, I can't promise a new national cemetery here before you today. I can promise I will actively advocate for it. And I can advise you that I have actively advocated for it with some success. But many other players will be involved before a new national cemetery can be built here, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the next Administration, most importantly, the Congress. I will need the Congress's support to get authorization to build that cemetery and to get funding to build that cemetery. But subject to that caveat, I can tell you that the National Cemetery Administration will proceed, and we have already started our initial steps. But the point I want to make here is that it's not so much a question of if a cemetery is going to be built here, it's a question of when and where. Now, let me talk, for a second, if I can, though I'm over my time, Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Hall. Go ahead. Mr. Tuerk [continuing]. On the when and where questions. First, when. We estimate that Fort Logan will close in about 10 years. I've learned from hard experience over the last couple of years, that it's a 5-year proposition to get a new national cemetery open--to acquire the land, to go through all of the environmental analysis, to design the cemetery, to construct the cemetery's first phase, not the entirety of the cemetery, but just the first phase, is a 5-year proposition. We're about 10 years out from Fort Logan closing. We recognize that reality. We are proceeding now with the first steps to get the new cemetery in place. What have we done? We have sought and we have pending before the Congress right now a legislative proposal to include in our budget a separate line item, which would authorize us to acquire land independent of a separate authorization to build a new cemetery, to acquire a land in advance of the precise need for that land so that we may start to shop and seize opportunities to acquire land as they become available. We had specifically in mind, when we requested this authority, this community and a couple of other communities that will suffer a similar fate as this one will if we don't get moving now. Portland, Oregon, is in a similar situation to Denver- Colorado Springs. Our cemetery in Portland can't expand. We've got to find a successor site there. San Juan, Puerto Rico is in a similar situation. We're at the end, the last phase of cemetery development there. We've got to start acquiring land now so that we can have a new cemetery already in place when the old one closes. If we get this authorization, and if we get adequate funding from the Congress to proceed, we expect, depending on when this year's appropriations bills get enacted, to proceed to start to scout for land immediately. Upon getting that authority and getting funding, we will start to look. The next critical question is where. This Under Secretary wishes he hadn't already popped off on that subject. But I did testify before your senior Senator about 3 weeks ago. Senator Allard asked me the question of where I thought the appropriate site might be. I did offer in that testimony the view that it seemed to me that somewhere between Colorado Springs and Denver would probably make sense. Why? That point of view was pretty much governed by what I have heard from this community telling me that traversing from here to Denver is unacceptable. My thought process was, when Denver's cemetery closes, the veterans of Denver would have the same point of view if the cemetery were all the way down here or south of here. They would have to traverse the same traffic that Colorado Springs' veterans do traveling north. They would have to traverse the same weather. They would have to traverse the same highways that the folks in Colorado Springs find unacceptable heading north. I offered that opinion based, essentially, on that fact. But it was premature for me to have offered an opinion, I think, on where the cemetery ought to be sited. If we get the authority we seek, I am going to send real estate pros out here to scour the entirety of the front range to see what we can find, to see what's available, to see what might be appropriate sites. I or my successor--candidly it will probably be my successor--will get recommendations from that group of professionals, recommendations that won't look unlike these with the sort of scoring, the sort of charting, taking into account various factors. And at that point, the Under Secretary, after having gotten input from the community, will probably, at that point, make a decision on where the site ought to be. What sort of things will he take into account, will he or she take into account? Certainly the size of an available site is very important to us. This will not be a satellite cemetery to Fort Logan. It will be a full blown national cemetery that we will want to last for up to 100 years. We will be looking for at least, least 200 acres, probably, in view of the topography here, twice that amount. We will be looking at, and we will take into account, proximity of various sites to the veteran population to be served, a factor that I prematurely took into account with my testimony and my response to Senator Allard. It's one factor; but it's only one factor. We will look at the quality of the land in question. Does it have access to utilities? Does it have access to water? Is it relatively flat? Is it free from subsurface rock and fill? That's an important factor to us. We'll take into account, finally, the cost, the cost to buy the proposed site and the cost to develop it. When all of these factors and others are taken into account, that's when a decision will be made. And certainly we will take into account what I have heard here about the desire to be south of--the hill that I---- Mr. Hall. Monument Hill? Mr. Tuerk [continuing]. The Monument that I got stuck in on the way down from here. Certainly that will be taken into account as well. I did not mean to suggest that Pueblo is entirely inappropriate. I did not mean to suggest that southern El Paso County is entirely inappropriate. These things will have to be weighed, but they have to be weighed, it seems to me, in light of the fact that Denver, at the point of decision, will be facing an absence of a cemetery. And there's a very significant veterans'"
