        "text": "Silver Star Recipients\n\nAllen, Warren E. - 2nd Ranger Company\n\nBecton, Julius Jr. - He rose from private to lieutenant general, fighting in three wars during his nearly 40-year Army career. Becton was awarded the Silver Star for leading his platoon in an attack on Hill 201 near the Naktong River. He joined the Army as a private in 1944, retiring as a lieutenant general in 1983. \"On the morning of September 17th, Lt. Becton was ordered to lead his platoon in an attack against enemy positions near the Naktong River on Hill 201. Under intense mortar, automatic weapons, and small arms fire, Becton led his men in a spirited charge up the hill. Despite being hit by enemy fire, Lt. Becton ignored the pain and encouraged his men onward. His platoon plowed ahead, killing and wounding many enemy troops, and forcing them to withdraw. The other platoons from Company L assigned to back up Lt. Becton's charge had been pinned down by heavy fire coming from a nearby ridge, and were unable to move forward. Despite being cut off from the remainder of his company, Becton urged his men forward, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Upon reaching a position with favorable terrain, he stopped and skillfully deployed his troops to form a defensive perimeter. For the next ten hours, Becton and his men defended their position, repelling several enemy attempts to overrun their small force. Becton was wounded three additional times during the fight, but refused to give in and stubbornly held his ground. That night, under the cover of darkness, Becton was able to lead his men back to the main elements of his battalion. Though the U.N. forces were unable to break out from the Pusan Perimeter that day, Becton's initiative and skillful leadership prevented the North Koreans from making a counterattack, allowing the 3rd Battalion to occupy an advantageous position from which they would later drive the enemy from the entire area. Julius Becton would receive the Silver Star for his heroism on that day and after a short time in the hospital recovering from his wounds, he rejoined his regiment, becoming Executive Officer for Company I.\" [Source: TogetherWeServed]\n\nBussey, Capt. Charles - On July 20, 1950, Army Capt. Charles Bussey, the commander of the all-black 77th Engineer Co., was awarded the Silver Star for his action at the battle of Yechon.\n\nClark, A.C. - Pfc. (Later Corporal) Clark was serving as an automatic rifleman in Company H, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines when he was awarded a Silvar Star for covering the evacuation of two wounded Marines in his combat patrol He was from Louisiana. His citation reads:\n\n\"The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Private First Class \"A\" \"C\" Clark (MCSN: 1221465), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as an Automatic Rifleman of Company H, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 13 December 1952. When the combat patrol was subjected to intense enemy fire and two of his comrades were seriously wounded, Private First Class Clark fearlessly advanced forward of the casualties and brought devastating fire to bear upon the enemy, thereby enabling several other Marines to remove the wounded men to safety. Continuing his attack, he silenced one hostile machine gun with the fire of his automatic rifle and killed three enemy soldiers. Although twice wounded during the action, and suffering extreme pain, he refused evacuation and assisted in evacuating two other casualties to the main line of resistance. By his outstanding courage, marked fortitude and selfless devotion to duty, Private First Class Clark served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

With fire coming from all directions, the Americans fell one by one. Shot through the thigh, McEachin returned fire while his commander, First Lt. Henry A. Schenk, a 29-year-old white officer who had emigrated from Austria at the age of 6, directed their desperate defense. Determined to assist Schenk, McEachin crawled toward the lieutenant's position before taking a second shot to the gut, as two more men were felled by enemy fire. Schenk was then hit and mortally wounded. Seconds later another blast hit McEachin, rendering him unconscious. McEachin awoke, lying face up in a nearby creek, the battlefield silent. The severity of his injuries quickly became apparent; he could barely move. Somehow he mustered strength and began crawling toward a patch of reeds. Suddenly the shadow of a man came toward him, a blond American soldier in Army fatigues who had taken refuge in the reeds during the attack. The men had never met, let alone spoken, but the soldier quickly began attending to McEachin's wounds, using his own T-shirt to craft a makeshift tourniquet. With McEachin half-conscious and unable to walk, the soldier carried him across the countryside and through streams toward safety while evading enemy troops. Reaching a forward aid station, McEachin was placed on a litter and prepped for evacuation. During their goodbyes, McEachin told the man who had saved his life: \"I never got your name.\" The soldier replied: \"I never got yours either. Let's just say we're brothers under the skin.\" McEachin, who never learned the man's identity, received a Silver Star and Purple Heart for his actions and later became an award-winning actor.

On that date, Sergeant Miles participated in a classified mission, code named Spitfire, behind enemy lines in the vicinity of Karyoju-ri, North Korea, was, along with two other special operations soldiers, attempting to retrieve supply bundles dropped earlier that morning on the wrong drop zone when his group came under fire from a Chinese company advancing toward Spitfire's main base of operations. Sergeant Miles could have broken contact and evaded but elected to engage in a delaying action to give Spitfire's main body time to escape and evade despite knowing he and the other two were facing impossible odds and this decision would likely result in his own death, which it did. Surviving Spitfire members reported the ensuing firefight lasted thirty or so minutes, giving them time to clear the area and evade, eventually reaching friendly lines after a twenty-one day odyssey. Sergeant Miles' actions saved his fellow team members from death or capture and are well above and beyond the call of duty.

The action took place in the early morning hours along a narrow ridge of loose shale shrouded in low clouds that reduced visibility to a few feet. Overrun by the enemy, Pugh’s company formed a circular defensive position along a sheer drop and held off multiple waves of charging North Koreans. White company commander Major Melvin Blair ordered his men to withdraw from the ridge top once they had depleted their ammunition, throwing his own spent sidearm into the face of an attacker before doing so. Pugh and several others who still had rounds to fire volunteered to cover the withdrawal of their comrades. When most of the company had sufficiently moved back, Blair shouted for the volunteers to join. Still having ammunition Pugh, continued firing at the enemy and urged his commander to keep moving back. At this point, Blair grabbed a rifle from a wounded soldier and moved back up the ridge to assist. In the process, he was tackled to the ground by charging North Koreans, who were swiftly gunned down by Pugh. When Blair regained his footing and again shouted for Pugh to fall back, he responded “Hell, we are having fun.” Pugh and his comrades did not fall back until Blair officially ordered them to do so. The group reached the bottom of the mountain four hours later. Major Blair reported, “they are great soldiers…I am recommending Pugh for the Distinguished Service Cross and the other members of the last guard for the Silver Star.” Pugh returned to the United States in May 1951 and helped teach student officers combat lessons at Fort Benning, Georgia. At the time of the Korean War, Pugh already had fifteen years of Army service and had earned a Bronze Star for WWII service at Guadalcanal and Italy.

Instead of being charged with AWOL, (Absent Without Leave) he was charged with cowardice in the presence of the enemy. And fortunately for him, he produced two witnesses: a major in the Medical Corps and a lieutenant in the Nurse Corps, both of whom testified that he was in a base hospital the very day that he was supposed to be AWOL.

Rudy, can be likened to the jazz music that shaped the many facets of his life: smooth, mellow, and thoughtful, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of everyone who is fortunate enough to have been in his presence. After graduating with a BA degree in music, from Southern University in Baton Rouge, Rudy joined the Army. During his six years of distinguished service in the Armed Forces, Rudy served in the Korean War. He served his country honorably, while continuing to add fuel to his musical flame: He was director of an Army jazz band known as the Down Beats; Band Director of the 56th and the 289th Army Bands in Korea and Japan, respectively. His bands entertained troops during the Korean War and greeted all the ships that transported troops to Korea. Many of Rudy's former band members went on to play with Count Basie and other \"Big Bands\" after their service tenure. Rudy, however, decided that Louisiana was where he belonged. He left the Army as a Master Sergeant to return home with the Combat Infantry Badge. Rudy continued his education, receiving his master's degree in music from the University of Southwestern Louisiana after withdrawing from LSU when he was not allowed to direct the band before a white audience because he was black. He began his \"formal\" teaching career at Southern University as the Assistant Band Director. He left Southern University, and from 1957 through the 60's, during Jim Crow segregation, he taught music at Central High in Natchitoches and Central High in Bogalusa. His last employer was the Lafayette Parish School System, where he taught music at Acadian, Broussard, Youngsville, and Moss Middle Schools from 1968 to 1985. After retirement, he volunteered his music teaching services at Holy Rosary Institute and Immaculate Heart of Mary. Rudy was a leader in his community and spoke truth to power. He worked tirelessly to balance the inequities that existed in a Jim Crow south that demanded submission from black people who were considered \"less than.\" Being a nonconformist was risky, but Rudy decided submitting to the racist customs of the period was not an option. He stopped attending Catholic church when he grew tired of his family sitting in the back pews and taking communion last. He was always on a counter-racist code. As a Korean war veteran, he followed the example of the Deacons of Defense and, along with other black war veterans, protected their neighborhood by implementing organized security protocols. His youngest son was born the year Emmett Till was lynched. He promised his children this would only happen to them over his dead body. In 1971, Lafayette Parish was newly desegregated. Protest arose over the mistreatment of black students at Northside High. There were also demands to hire black teachers, administrators, and coaches. The superintendent told Rudy that he needed to put an end to his sons' participation in these demonstrations; but Rudy, told his son to continue fighting for justice. This unending support and love were again evident when his son was expelled from Port Allen High School in West Baton Rouge Parish and arrested for participating in more demonstrations. Rudy touched the lives of many of his students. He motivated them to work toward their highest degree of proficiency. His enthusiasm was palpable when former students would express how he made a difference in their lives. These moments were cherished because it served as evidence that he had accomplished what he had set out to do: to get them to reach higher and to believe. Rudy believed that everyone deserved respect and could succeed if given order and responsibility. As a result, his bands were not only exceptionally talented and skillful, but well-disciplined and organized. He would accept students in his band that were labeled as \"behavior problems.\" He embraced them and used compassionate discipline to get them back on track. He showed them that someone cared. That was his way. He believed that every child was capable of high academic achievement, no matter their race, income, or zip code. In 1991, he and his son started a boy scout troop that served the black community of North Lafayette. Many of the scouts attended Moss Middle, the lowest performing school in the parish. He wanted to show his scouts that they could achieve the most ambitious goals. They set a goal to backpack the Grand Canyon from rim to rim. They trained for two years and in 1993, he and 17 scouts, ages 12 and 13, backpacked the Grand Canyon from the south rim to the north rim. His scouts continued in high adventure scouting to climb Mount Whitney in California and Mount Rainier in Washington. Rudy was an avid bass fisherman. His favorite fishing spot was Henderson Lake. Upon retirement, he resided in Houma, LA and quickly became a member of the community band. He and his wife Lois Walker Davis, the heart of his life, enjoyed year-round gardening and great fishing. Rudy was preceded in death by his wife, Lois Walker Davis, his parents, Edwin and Edith Taylor Davis, brothers Edwin and Harold Davis, and a sister, Mary Davis. He leaves to cherish his memory four loving children, Rudolph Davis, Jr. and Greg Davis, Sr., and stepdaughters Nell Hebert and Arris Charles, two daughters-in-law, Donna and Dorothy Davis, 10 grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren, two brothers, Donald Sr. and John Davis and 3 sisters-in-law, Iris, Jackie and Shams Davis, and a host of nieces, nephews and friends.\n\nDeiz, Robert William - associated with war bond poster.

Afterwards, Gibbons pitched for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1948 to 1949. Nevertheless, he had his greatest successes neither in Florida nor the Negro Leagues. It came when the Clowns sold him to the Brandon Greys of the Mandak League. Gibbons then went to Canada and joined the Brandon club from 1949 to 1950. In his first season, he was the most dominant hurler in a league that also boasted Leon Day and Satchel Paige, as he went 19-5 and fanned 229 in 198 innings pitched, completing 20 of his 23 starts while leading the club in wins and the league in strikeouts.

Joel demonstrated indomitable courage, determination, and professional skill when a numerically superior and well-concealed Viet Cong element launched a vicious attack which wounded or killed nearly every man in the lead squad of the company. After treating the men wounded by the initial burst of gunfire, he bravely moved forward to assist others who were wounded while proceeding to their objective. While moving from man to man, he was struck in the right leg by machinegun fire. Although painfully wounded his desire to aid his fellow soldiers transcended all personal feeling. He bandaged his own wound and self-administered morphine to deaden the pain enabling him to continue his dangerous undertaking. Through this period of time, he constantly shouted words of encouragement to all around him. Then, completely ignoring the warnings of others, and his pain, he continued his search for wounded, exposing himself to hostile fire; and, as bullets dug up the dirt around him, he held plasma bottles high while kneeling completely engrossed in his life saving mission. Then, after being struck a second time and with a bullet lodged in his thigh, he dragged himself over the battlefield and succeeded in treating 13 more men before his medical supplies ran out. Displaying resourcefulness, he saved the life of one man by placing a plastic bag over a severe chest wound to congeal the blood. As one of the platoons pursued the Viet Cong, an insurgent force in concealed positions opened fire on the platoon and wounded many more soldiers. With a new stock of medical supplies, Sp6c. Joel again shouted words of encouragement as he crawled through an intense hail of gunfire to the wounded men. After the 24-hour battle subsided and the Viet Cong dead numbered 410, snipers continued to harass the company. Throughout the long battle, Sp6c. Joel never lost sight of his mission as a medical aidman and continued to comfort and treat the wounded until his own evacuation was ordered. His meticulous attention to duty saved a large number of lives and his unselfish, daring example under most adverse conditions was an inspiration to all. Sp6c. Joel's profound concern for his fellow soldiers, at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.\" Lawrence Joel was born February 22, 1928 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and died February 04, 1984 in Winston-Salem.
