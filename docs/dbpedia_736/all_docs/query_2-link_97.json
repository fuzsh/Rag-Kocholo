        "text": "Sean Kirst: A lifetime after World War II, cherishing the most precious of treasures\n\nIt was easy, for so long, to think the stories would be there.\n\nThere was the cedar chest in the attic, which held my father’s battered Army cap, his scrapbooks and a pair of ornate sandals he brought home for my mother, from the war. There were the black-and-white photographs on the mantel and the medals on a bedroom dresser, which my parents always talked about maybe framing up, but never did.\n\nThere were the moments when my dad and my mom spoke across the table of lighter memories, of the camp where my father would swim each day to the cabin they rented on the side of a small nearby lake, of their long and separate train rides to New York City not long before my dad went overseas – with Manhattan their closest point for meeting in the middle.\n\nWorld War II had shaped the trajectory of their lives, which was pretty much the same for the parents of many kids I knew at school. It was that way for my uncle, who came over to drink coffee with my folks, and for the guys my father worked with on the coal pile at the steam station, and for the man in the white shirt behind the counter at the corner store.\n\nEven now, the generation that endured the war carries the memory of “V-J Day” with a mesh of joy, relief and sorrow.\n\nThey had all been in \"the war,\" a reality and seemingly casual reference that was as present in our collective lives as the weather that swept in off the lake, even if my parents did not spend much time talking about it.\n\nYet I learned early – a realization in my gut long before I consciously worked through it, in my head – that there were things you did not ask, and places you did not go, because whatever answers you hoped to learn at 10 or 15 or 20 seemed certain to be offered someday, someplace, when it was the right time.\n\nWhat I learned late was that life moves like lightning, and many things that seem forever disappear long before you are prepared, in any way.\n\nI went to college, met my wife-to-be, graduated and started moving around as we built our lives. My parents both died while I was in my mid-20s, gone before they had much of a chance to take the breath they had worked so hard to earn. Moving toward 35 years later, I still contemplate mysteries I wish I had asked about when I had the chance.\n\nEven after they were gone, many of their siblings and their longtime friends were still around, and I figured there was time to learn some answers.\n\nGeorge and Corrine Klein of Amherst make annual pilgrimages to remember their high school friend who was killed in the siege of Iwo Jima.\n\nThat is a dangerous assumption. You raise your kids and go to work and do each day what you need to do, and you wake up one morning and you are 61, gray-haired, with the recognition that the end of World War II is now as far from us in the American past as the end of the Civil War was to my parents, on the day Pearl Harbor was bombed.\n\nOnce, the daily rhythm of every community in the nation was dominated by generations shaped by those war years. Today? After lifetimes that encompassed cascading national struggles, the demographic that came of age in World War II had already dwindled to a sliver – even before the women and men who so vividly recall the war were among the most vulnerable and isolated, in the pandemic.\n\nAccording to reports, only somewhere beyond an estimated 100,000 veterans are still with us from the 16 million people who served in the American military during World War II, which equates to less than 1%.\n\nIf we are going to listen, our last chance is now.\n\nThat is the point of today’s special section in The Buffalo News, which includes portraits of veterans who served during that time. But it is also a truth I try my best to remember in daily life, with the tiny group of mentors, relatives and friends whose memories of those decades of great change now translate into the greatest kind of civic treasure.\n\nConscious of the swift passing of her generation, Holocaust survivor Sonia Klein fears what happens without the sharp edge of eyewitness memory.\n\nBuffalo sent thousands upon thousands of soldiers, sailors and Marines off to war, many departing by train from the Central Terminal. Most – but in an aching way, nowhere close to all – returned to the embrace of family in that same echoing place, some dealing with wounds that in many ways would take lifetimes to heal.\n\nFor the most part, they were working people who had endured the trials of the Great Depression, then were thrust into a war that claimed an almost unfathomable number of lives around the world. They left a community that went into rationing and an anxious vigil while they were gone, a community where thousands of women took wartime jobs in places like Curtiss-Wright or Bell Aircraft, where my mother worked – a workplace shift that would accelerate vast changes in the American landscape.\n\nThere is something in the wording – in a voice that somehow captures both a battle-worn officer and the younger brother, far from home – that makes it eternal, Kirst says.\n\nIn the decades after the war, those who returned and those who had done their own service at home ran school bingo games and were elected to city councils. They worked in hospitals and schools and on the floors of factories. They built Little League fields and neighborhood veterans posts.\n\nStill, what I learned – a lesson I suspect was shared by many of my friends – is that certain things came up only at rare flashes in time, maybe on some gentle morning when sunlight cut through steam from perking coffee on the stove. For whatever reason, at those quiet moments, my parents felt a need to talk.\n\nLike countless families, we had our own loss during the war. Sitting at the kitchen table, my mother might speak of the toddler daughter – my sister – who died of encephalitis while my dad was in the Pacific, grief that never totally went out of our house. Maybe she would bring up a brother whose grave we sometimes visited in the veterans’ section at Forest Lawn – a guy she loved who survived combat and then came home, clearly suffering, to take his own life as a young man.\n\nAs for my father, he would listen to our childhood questions about the war and use humor as a strategy to quickly shift to something else. He was a quiet guy, and only once did he speak to me of what he saw in combat. He stood on the sidewalk beyond my mother’s hearing, always his chosen place when it was something that was not easy to say, and he responded to a hard passage in my own life by sharing a glimpse of what he witnessed in the surf, during a landing.\n\nIt was enough to make me realize that so many of these people I encountered all the time – doing their jobs, raising their kids, waiting in line at Tops – went home at night to silent rooms and similar visions.\n\nSuddenly, now, all of that is so long ago. The impossible truths you are warned about when you are young – that years can seem to vanish as quickly as a sunrise – are, as we each learn, inevitably true. Even the youngest of the “kids” who went into the service as teens, near the end of World War II, are well into their 90s – if we are lucky enough to have them here, at all.\n\nThey are the bearers of firsthand witness no one else can share again, reminding us of how one of the most profound acts of tribute is also a fundamental measure of respect:\n\nIt is simply to listen, to hear every word, while we still can.\n\nStories of Honor: Raymond E. Clancy made Christmas delivery to Gen. George Patton\n\nOn Christmas Day 1944, Raymond E. Clancy made an important holiday delivery – a delivery of gasoline for Gen. George S. Patton's tanks during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\n\"We had to land in a little cornfield\" in the Belgian town of Bastogne, the 97-year-old Army Air Forces veteran said. His C-47 Skytrain delivered hundreds of metal jerrycans full of fuel, then returned to France. \"We took off as soon as we could; we didn't want to get stuck there,\" he said.\n\nClancy remembered flying about a dozen missions as an aerial engineer and crew chief with the 91st Troop Carrier Squadron of the 439th Troop Carrier Group.\n\nHe was born in Buffalo, the oldest child and only son of Edward and Florence Hickey Clancy. He grew up in the Kensington-Bailey area and graduated from St. James grammar school. He studied auto mechanics for two years at Burgard Vocational High School before enlisting.\n\n\"Do you know when I got my diploma?\" he asked with a chuckle. \"I was 70. My son went over to the school and showed them my honorable discharge papers and they made out a diploma for me.\"\n\nBefore leaving for basic training at Greensboro, N.C. – where \"it was hot, hot, hot,\" he recalled –- he had met a neighborhood girl, Elizabeth \"Betty\" J. Spizzano. From chatting at a neighborhood playground, he started walking her home and eventually met her parents.\n\n\"Then when I enlisted, she wrote to me almost every day,\" he said. \"No matter where I was stationed, the letters would catch up to me. I wrote back whenever I could.\"\n\nWith his training in car repair, Clancy was assigned to aircraft mechanics school. His first post was to Burbank, Calif., where he trained on the P-39, a Bell Aircraft product. He was then transferred to Gulfport, Miss., where he was assigned to the C-47 Skytrain. After completing training as a specialist mechanic, he flew to England at the end of 1943, serving at the Balderton and Upottery Royal Air Force bases.\n\nClancy's C-47 could tow two G-4 gliders filled with paratroopers or transport supplies or vehicles.\n\n\"Those poor paratroopers,\" he said, \"they didn't know where they were, they didn't know anything, but they had to drop out, get under cover and start fighting.\"\n\nAfter the Germans were driven out of France in late summer 1944, Clancy and his men moved to Alencon, France. \"We lived in a tent city there,\" he said. \"The Germans had left lots of small hand grenades and other things like ammunition\" capable of injuring or even killing people, he said.\n\nWhen they made the fuel delivery during the Battle of the Bulge, his plane flew into a battle area. But \"they kept the airplane landing zone free and clear of ground fire,\" Clancy said. \"They unloaded it real fast and we got out of there, and they were so thankful to get that gas.\"\n\nDuring his missions, \"we got shot up a couple of times where new metal had to be used for repairs,\" he said.\n\nWhile he was in France in October 1944, Clancy, a corporal, wrote a letter asking Betty Spizzano to marry him. She said yes.\n\nHe was honorably discharged as a sergeant in October 1945 with an Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters, a Distinguished Unit Badge and the European, African and Middle Eastern Ribbon with six battle stars.\n\nHe and Betty married on Jan. 16, 1946, in St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church. They had a son, Robert, and a daughter, Kathleen.\n\nWith a job history that included working in gas stations, driving a taxi and selling everything from college football programs to used cars and fences, Clancy resumed work. \"I never collected unemployment in my life,\" he said proudly. After a few years, he was hired as a brakeman by the old Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Co., then worked for Conrail. His 37 years included working as a freight and passenger conductor before retiring in 1985.\n\nThe couple lived in Cheektowaga for many years until Betty Clancy died after 73 years of marriage, and almost two years ago, Clancy moved into Elderwood in Hamburg. There he has his medals in a frame and a large bald eagle with stars and stripes on his wall, a testimony to his service.\n\nStories of Honor: From a Niagara County farm to sports to the Battle of Iwo Jima\n\nOver the next month, The Buffalo News will continue to tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

Kinyon saw both the majestic and the morose aboard the USS Shoshone.\n\nThe Niagara County native witnessed the iconic moment when Marines raised the U.S. flag during the Battle of Iwo Jima.\n\nHe also watched fallen Marines buried at sea in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe World War II veteran, who enlisted in the Navy in November 1942 at age 20, turns 99 today.\n\n\"I seen a lot of good things and a lot of bad,\" Kinyon said.\n\nThe Shoshone, an attack cargo ship, carried smaller boats used to transport Marines and supplies.\n\nKinyon's job aboard the ship was maintaining and repairing engines. In this three-plus years in the Navy, he rose to the rank of chief motor machinist's mate.\n\nHe was among 14 chiefs on the Shoshone, which felt pretty packed when the 366-person crew was joined by 350 Marines and their 15 German shepherds.\n\nBorn in a farmhouse in Appleton, what Kinyon remembers most about the first day of the invasion of Iwo Jima is the bullets flying overhead, he said.\n\nA kamikaze pilot attacked the boat just ahead of the Shoshone during the invasion.\n\n\"Boy, was that a blast,\" he said of the explosion.\n\nThe Marines who went ashore the first day could barely get off the island's black beaches, Kinyon said.\n\nOn the second day of fighting, Marines used blowtorches to clear tunnels of Japanese troops. After a scorching fire, they would send the dogs in.\n\nAs a young man, Kinyon grew up on a farm and excelled as an athlete. He grew up playing sports with his older brother, Ralph.\n\nIn 1941, while playing for Barker High School, Roy Kinyon was a two-sport star. In baseball, he led the Niagara-Orleans League in both batting average and, in basketball, scoring average, according to newspaper clippings his mother, Jennie, kept. He was captain of the baseball and basketball teams that each won the league championship that year.\n\nBefore he enlisted, he played semi-professional baseball for a team in Olcott and was invited for a tryout with the Buffalo Bisons.\n\nWhile Roy Kinyon picked the Navy, his brother signed up for the Army Air Forces.\n\nRoy Kinyon's talent and love of sports helped him get through some of the monotony of his time in the service, his family said. While at a training base in Florida in 1944, he convinced the base commander to let him try out for a baseball team comprised of professionals and college players.\n\nHe made the Fort Pierce Commandos, playing left field and second base, and traveled around the state playing other military teams.\n\nHe got back from the war in 1946. The following year, he broke his leg in a fall from a piece of equipment while at a job in Barker. He spent three months recovering at Buffalo General Hospital, which is where he met a nurse named Theresa.\n\nThey got married in July 1948, had four children and were together 64 years. Theresa Kinyon died in 2013.\n\nRoy Kinyon now has 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nHe spent 35 years working at Harrison Radiator in Lockport. He prays the rosary daily and remains an avid sports fan.\n\nDuring the Battle of Iwo Jima, the crew of the Shoshone ferried food and ammunition for the Marines between the ship and the island \"all day long,\" Kinyon said.\n\nIt was quite a moment when the Marines raised the flag on the fifth day of the battle.\n\n\"That's when I had chills going up and down my back when all the ships started blowing their horns,\" he said. \"It was unreal.\"\n\nStories of Honor: Seven decades after WWII, veteran remembers the happier moments\n\nIn May and June, The Buffalo News will tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

Arthur P. Miller of Buffalo cultivated a broad range of memories from triumphant to tragic.\n\nAs he sat under a gazebo on the grounds of the Brothers of Mercy campus in Clarence more than 75 years later, surrounded by his medals and memorabilia, it was the happier moments about which Miller chose to reminisce.\n\nThey included sharing a bottle of scotch with a couple of U.S. citizens who were stranded in Rome prior to the liberation of Italy by Allied forces; sharing a 200-pound wheel of Limburger cheese with an entire village in Austria; and sharing a poignant encounter with a German soldier in which they both managed to avoid killing or getting killed.\n\nMiller's youngest son, Paul, who now lives in Houston, said his father has been brimming with these long-ago memories in recent years.\n\n\"That's his whole life now. He never talked about it for years, but that's the biggest part of his life now,\" said Paul Miller.\n\nHis father was eager to share and genuinely humbled by those taking an interest in his stories, including staff at the Brothers of Mercy Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where the 96-year-old veteran has been a permanent resident for three years.\n\nMiller was born on June 28, 1924, in Buffalo, and grew up on the East Side. He attended St. Stanislaus Catholic Elementary School and was a 1939 graduate of Seneca Vocational High School before he was drafted into the Army in 1941.\n\nAs a result of his background in radio and telephone technology, Miller said he requested that service be in communications.\n\n\"I told them I wanted to be in electronics. So I wound up being in charge of telephone and telegraph,\" he said.\n\nMiller said that did not spare him service on the battle lines, though.\n\nHe served in North Africa, Italy, France, Austria and Germany. Miller joined his men on the Appian Way to Rome in May 1945 for the liberation of Italy. Miller said he and his Jeep driver, Pablo Garcia, encountered an American husband and wife in Rome who had been trapped in the city since the start of the war and were grateful to see him.\n\n\"The nice part about it was that the woman had a big, American flag. She wrapped it around me,\" said Miller.\n\n\"Naturally, I was crying and she was crying,\" he said, dabbing his eyes with a tissue.\n\nThe husband broke out a bottle of Haig & Haig scotch that the couple had been saving, vowing not to open it until Italy was liberated.\n\n\"So we all had a little drink out of that bottle, and they welcomed us and I welcomed them ... So, that was a happy day,\" Miller said.\n\nHe even found something pleasant to remember in dealing with one of the enemy, during a chance encounter in Germany, in which either of them could have wound up dead.\n\n\"I made friends with people who were ready to kill me,\" Miller said.\n\nHow did he manage that?\n\n\"Very easily. I just talked them out of doing it,\" he said.\n\n\"He was the same age I was. We were both 19 or 20, and he carried a rifle, and I said, \"I don't like you carrying that rifle. Why don't you put it on the ground? And he said 'why?' And I said, 'because it's making me nervous.' And so he finally laid it down,'\" Miller said.\n\nMiller spoke to the German soldier half in German and half in English, and asked him: \" 'Why do we want to kill each other?' I said, 'why don't we go home. You're as old as I am. You probably have a girlfriend or a wife. You can have a family. You can raise your family and forget about the war,' \" Miller said.\n\nThe two men saluted each other and walked away.\n\n\"There's only one thing I feel bad about and that's I didn't get his name,\" Miller said.\n\nHe recalled the time a German air force officer surrendered to him in Austria near the end of the war.\n\n\"We were taking German prisoners down the road, a back road, and I noticed this little white thing coming out of the forest. So I told Pablo, my driver, 'why don't you stop.' It looked like someone was waving a little white flag. So he stopped .... and I waved him on and he came in,\" Miller said of the German officer.\n\n\"He was the sharpest soldier I ever saw in my life,\" Miller recalled, describing his long chamois leather coat and boots.\n\n\"The only thing he could see is that I had a .45 on my side and a .38 on my shoulder holster,\" said Miller.\n\nIn the midst of war, Miller still marveled at the beauty of Austria.\n\n\"I stayed there with my men for a whole month, and we ate a lot of Limburger cheese, Swiss cheese and drank a lot of beer. And it was very easy because ... we found out after a few days, hey, there's a little brewery here, and a little cheese factory,\" Miller said.\n\n\"Now, the only way I could buy the cheese was in a 200-pound wheel that they made,\" he added. \"We gave the people that lived in this town the cheese. They did a lot of stuff for us. They became our family and we became their family. It was wonderful.\"\n\nAfter 3½ years of service, Miller was discharged in 1945.\n\nHe earned the Bronze Star, and during a 2011 ceremony in New York City, Miller was awarded the National Order of the Legion of Honor from the president of France for his participation in the liberation of France.\n\nMiller cherishes a framed black-and-white photograph he took of Allied soldiers in the shadow outside the Eagle's Nest in Anzio, Italy.\n\nHe married the former Madeline Marie Bokowski in 1950.\n\nThey had three children, now in their 60s: Gretchen; Timothy, a retired New York City-based actor; and Paul. The couple had two grandchildren.\n\nThey were married for 65 years until her death in 2015.\n\nMiller was a mechanical engineer for the Sylvania Company in Batavia for 30 years.\n\nPhotos: WWII veteran Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor Arthur Miller\n\nStories of Honor: Buffalo man who went ashore on D-Day simply 'did the job'\n\nIn May and June, The Buffalo News will tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

Balliett saw nearly a year of combat in France and Germany and won a Bronze Star for courage under fire.\n\nToday, as he prepares to celebrate his 98th birthday in June, Balliett says his wartime experiences were no big deal.\n\n\"I had a job to do. I was called to do the job. I did the job. The job is over and we came home,\" Balliett said during an interview in his Buffalo home. \"The World War II veterans, as a majority, did not come home and talk about the war. I don't know why. We just didn't.\"\n\nHe said he never thought he would be killed, unlike some of his buddies who expected to die – and did. Balliett survived several incidents without a scratch.\n\n\"I'm not a hero. The real heroes are dead,\" said Balliett. \"It was still combat, but it wasn't as bad as infantry combat.\"\n\nOn D-Day, June 6, 1944, Balliett's 344th Field Artillery Battalion landed on Utah Beach, by far the more lightly defended of the two beaches American forces assaulted on the German-held Normandy coast.\n\n\"They missed the initial landing area, is what I heard. I didn't know they missed it because I didn't know where it was anyway,\" Balliett said.\n\nCasualties were light at first.\n\n\"The first time we went forward, it was quiet and peaceful. We were supposed to dig a foxhole,\" Balliett said. \"If you've ever been to Normandy, you can't dig a foxhole like you see on television. You had roots, you had rock. It was just enough to lay down, but it's not really protecting you.\"\n\nThat's where Balliett survived a \"tree burst,\" a shell that struck a tree and turned the wood into shrapnel, killing the soldier in the next hole. And it's where he successfully fled from a barn the Germans obliterated with shell fire while he was trying to sleep there.\n\nAfter the Germans retreated from Normandy, Balliett and his buddies checked out what their guns had done in the Falaise Gap, an escape route the Allies cut off.\n\n\"They took us artillery people on a tour. That sounds good, huh?\" Balliett said. \"You could see the bodies burnt. It stunk. It made me sick to my stomach, all these bodies of the Germans. We wiped them out there.\"\n\nHe earned his Bronze Star Feb. 1, 1945, near Heckhuscheid, Germany.\n\nThe citation says Pfc. Balliett \"assisted in establishing an artillery observation post and traversed an open field through intense shelling to lay the necessary telephone wire. On three occasions he advanced through unrelenting fire to locate and repair breaks in the line.\"\n\n\"They say three occasions. I have no idea. It could have been three, could have been two, could have been five,\" he said. \"All I remember is we ran out and made the splice.\"\n\nBalliett, a Buffalo native who attended School 45 and Lafayette High School in 1941, was drafted and assigned to the artillery during basic training at Fort Bragg, N.C.\n\nHe crossed the Atlantic aboard the USS John Ericsson, which had been a luxury liner before the Pentagon requisitioned it.\n\n\"By the time you got to England, you were worn out,\" Balliett said. \"You only had two meals a day because there were just too many men. By the time you got to stand up at the table – you didn't have to sit – you didn't feel like eating. It wasn't that good. The Red Cross gave us a package containing soap. It didn't lather like it was supposed to. It never cleaned you.\"\n\nAfter arrival in England, the men ran for the showers on shore. \"Ice-cold water,\" Balliett said.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Buffalo, married the former Bernice Twist, who died in 1989, and had two daughters, Suzanne, who is deceased, and Jo Ann Michael. He worked 39 years at Western Electric.\n\nIt's possible none of that might have happened if President Harry S. Truman hadn't ordered two atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan in 1945, making it unnecessary for Balliett and his buddies to invade that country after the Germans surrendered.\n\n\"That's why I have a Truman calendar,\" said Balliett, pointing to the wall of his home.\n\nStories of Honor: Orphaned at 5, a disciplined childhood prepared WWII vet for the Army\n\nIn May and June, The Buffalo News will tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

He and four siblings were sent to live there after the death of their parents.\n\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the signature New Deal programs to get through the Great Depression, and where Wienclawski spent two years prior to the Army, was also regimented.\n\n\"I was always disciplined and in the Army it was the same way,\" said Wienclawski, 101, who recently spoke about his life and military service from his Town of Tonawanda home.\n\nHe credits the orphanage for teaching a lot of life skills that served him well, though he said it was also like living in a jail since home and school were under one roof and leaving was restricted.\n\nAt the recommendation of an older brother, Wienclawski joined and flourished in the Civilian Conservation Corps, a two-year program that hired single men to work in parks, forests and other public lands.\n\n\"You learned everything. Everything!\" he said. \"I learned how to chop down trees, I worked as a surveyor, I learned how to drive a truck, operate a bulldozer, how to grade hills.\"\n\nPresident Biden has cited that program as an inspiration to call for a Climate Conservation Corps.\n\nWienclawski was put in charge of supplies when it was discovered he had taken bookkeeping, typing and shorthand at Riverside High School.\n\n\"I learned everything about ordering supplies, from truck parts to charcoal furnaces,\" Wienclawski said.\n\nIt turned out to be perfect training for the four years he spent in the Army.\n\nWhen his time was up, Wienclawski went to work as a crane operator at American Brass. He got his draft notice in 1942 and reported to a Niagara Falls induction center in 1943.\n\nWithin a short time he was made a supply sergeant at a base in Portland, Ore. On furlough, he returned to Buffalo that October to marry Amelia Boblak, who he met in his teens when they were frequent roller-skating partners. They were married for 76 years until her death in February 2020.\n\nWienclawski was transferred the following month and was a supply sergeant in Saipan, an island under Japanese control.\n\nAmong Wienclawski's photos is one of him posing shirtless with three of his military buddies, a cigar dangling from his mouth.\n\nHe was there during the three-week Battle of Saipan that began June 15, 1944. More than 3,400 Americans died and over 10,000 were wounded. An estimated 29,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. Civilian casualties were heavy.\n\nA wall in Wienclawski's living room displays two painted handkerchiefs made by civilian prisoners of war who lived on the barracks. He also keeps two dolls with kimonos made by another Japanese prisoner from rags dipped in cosmolene oil to clean rifles.\n\nWienclawski remains deeply touched by the works of art and the people who generously made them.\n\n\"I believe in judging people the way you would judge yourself,\" he said, adding that he fought against German and Japanese soldiers who \"didn't want to go against us anymore than we did.\"\n\n\"So you don't want to hold anything against them, and I don't,\" he added.\n\nWienclawski left the service in 1946 and returned to Buffalo, where his bride was waiting for him and his siblings still lived. He finished high school at a school for veterans and was rehired at American Brass, where he oversaw molten metal furnaces for much of his 45 years there.\n\nThe World War II veteran is a member of the Milton J. Brounshidle American Legion Post 205 and the Harry E. Crosby VFW Post 2472.\n\nHe was a longtime volunteer with the Brighton Fire Company.\n\nWienclawski is grateful for the life he's led despite the loss of his parents and the hardships that came after their deaths.\n\nAt the same time, there are wartime memories he would just as soon forget and is reluctant to discuss.\n\n\"I don't like to watch movies of the war,\" Wienclawski said. \"That brings back memories that you don't want to keep remembering.\"\n\nStories of Honor: He turned 18 at battle. At 94, he still thinks of the guys who didn't return\n\nOver the next two months, The Buffalo News will tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

One day, weeks before the end of the fighting in Europe, a fellow soldier, a married man in his 30s, died when a shell landed directly in his lap, Maier recalled.\n\n\"I think he was the last guy killed in our outfit,\" Maier said during a recent interview. \"Those are the guys I feel sorry for.\"\n\nMaier was just 17 when he enlisted in the Army through a specialized training program that sent him to study at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He had grown up in Racine, Wis., the only child of a machinist father and homemaker mother.\n\n\"I'm a lone star,\" Maier said. He attended a high school named after the original patent holder for malted milk and, in recent years, has provided $3,000 in annual scholarships to its graduates.\n\nAs a child, he built model airplanes using the wood from the boxes that held 2-pound blocks of Kraft cheese, a hobby that sparked an interest in flying.\n\n\"I wanted to become a pilot. But my eyesight was 20-400,\" Maier said.\n\nHe moved up his graduation from high school and, by February 1944, was on campus at Madison, where the members of his training program included future Playboy founder Hugh Hefner.\n\nThe group was supposed to spend four years there, but when D-Day came the Army ended the program in order to get more soldiers into the war as soon as possible.\n\nMaier went to basic training at what was then Camp Hood, in Texas, and by fall 1944 was on a troop ship heading to Scotland. He then joined the 314th, part of the 79th Infantry Division, in the Alsace region of France, where they replaced other units depleted by combat.\n\nThe 79th faced fierce resistance in eastern France and while crossing the Reine River into western Germany. \"We pushed the Germans out of there,\" he said.\n\nHe made it through the fighting, including marking his 18th birthday, without being wounded. But the exposure to combat, and to his fellow soldiers from across the country, was eye-opening to a teenager.\n\n\"You grow up fast,\" said Maier, noting he learned how to swear in Spanish.\n\nBy V-E Day, which marked Germany's surrender, Maier's unit was in Dortmund, Germany, guarding a brewery.\n\n\"To keep people away from what was left of the beer,\" he said with a laugh. \"The only people that got any beer was our company.\"\n\nHis regiment was preparing to join the fighting in the Pacific theater when word came of Japan's surrender.\n\nThe devastation wrought by the war was apparent, Maier added. \"We went through Nuremberg,\" he said. \"Nuremberg was rubble.\"\n\nMaier earned a Bronze Star medal for meritorious achievement, a recognition he modestly downplayed.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, I didn't do anything,\" Maier said. \"I think they just had a bunch of Bronze Stars they had to give out.\"\n\nHe came home in June 1946, returning to Madison to earn an engineering degree.\n\nWhen Bell Aerosystems recruited him to join the company's plant near Niagara Falls, Maier remembered thinking, \"Oh boy, I'm back on airplanes again.\"\n\nMaier met his future wife, Lucille, in January 1951 in Bell's employment office. Maier had his hat on the chair next to him in the crowded waiting area when she approached and asked if that seat was taken. Lucille Maier died in 1999.\n\nMaier was a development engineer at Bell and head of its accelerometer group. Some of the components his team worked on were incorporated into NASA's lunar module.\n\nHe left Bell in 1972 and joined Teledyne Taber in North Tonawanda, working as a chief engineer on aviation instrumentation, before retiring in 1980.\n\n\"I'm obsolete now,\" he quipped.\n\n***\n\nRead previous Stories of Honor:\n\nStories of Honor: WWII vet Paul Woods persevered through racism at home and overseas\n\nDuring the next 10 weeks, The Buffalo News will tell the stories of some of Western New York’s veterans who served our country in the armed services in World War II and beyond.\n\nKnow of a veteran's story we should tell?

The soldiers were under fire for three days and three nights as they waited for the tide to subside before they could reach the beach.\n\nWoods earned three Bronze Stars and a Philippine Liberation Medal for his military service in the Pacific Theater. But those accomplishments still were not enough for the Black veteran to secure a seat on a bus headed to his home state of Alabama after the war.\n\n“I remember it like it was yesterday,” said Woods, 98.\n\n“The bus was loaded. I had my uniform and all my medals on and was going to get on the bus, and the ole bus driver said, ‘No, you can’t get on the bus,' ” Woods said.\n\nA white lady offered to give up her seat, but the driver prohibited it, and Woods had to get off the bus.\n\n“It was a segregated country when it came to Blacks. Joe Louis was the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, and he couldn’t eat in a white restaurant,” he said.\n\nBut triumph clouded by hardship was already familiar to Woods.\n\nBorn in 1923 in Bazemore, Ala., he recalled having to walk 10 miles to get an education in a one-room schoolhouse.\n\nHis father died when Woods was only seven. He and his 13 siblings and half-siblings were split up at his father's gravesite and raised by various relatives. Woods went to live with a wealthy uncle, who had owned a Model T Ford when most African Americans didn’t even own a horse.\n\nStill, they could not get gasoline at filling stations that posted signs like, “Gas only for white people,” he said.\n\nIn 1941 at age 17, Woods joined a segregated U.S. Army and served for four years, discovering that war itself does not discriminate.\n\n“Everyone was brothers on the battlefield at all times,” Woods said. “A bullet knows no rank, no color, no status. It doesn’t care how rich you are or how poor you are. It doesn’t know you.”\n\nWoods and his wife, Mary, moved to Buffalo in 1953 with their three young children.\n\nA year later, he started working at Bethlehem Steel as a chipper, cleaning the steel to roll it. To feed his growing family – which eventually included 15 children – he worked two, sometimes three, shifts daily for 31 years until the plant closed.\n\n“We were never on welfare,” he said proudly. “I always taught my children charity begins at home.”\n\nAlong the way, the family built a home from the ground up on five acres in Angola in 1966. They were the first Black family in the neighborhood, said daughter Paulette Woods, a Buffalo School Board member.\n\n“The neighbors asked us if we were there to start a race riot,” she recalled.\n\nAll of Woods’ children went to college. He has 28 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. He and his wife also were licensed foster care providers through Randolph Child and Adolescent Services, and in 1997 were honored as Foster Parents of the Year.\n\nIn a February ceremony, Mayor Byron W. Brown and Rep. Brian Higgins honored Woods, the World War II coordinator for Jesse Clipper American Legion Post No. 430, with a flag and proclamations.\n\nHe was transported by Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., in April 2012 to see the World War II Memorial, where he met retired Sen. Bob Dole, another World War II hero.\n\nAnd when Woods returned to Australia four years ago, it was a very different experience compared to his previous time there.\n\nBack in 1942, he and thousands of Black soldiers were relegated to living in tents set up in the middle of a racetrack for horses. The white soldiers stayed in barracks, Woods said.\n\nIn December 2017, he went back to the Warwick Farm Racecourse once more and was presented with a picture of the tents the Black servicemen stayed in at the racetrack. He also met with the U.S. consul general in Sydney.\n\nWoods said he’s glad to be in the land of the living, given what he’s gone through in war abroad and in dealing with racism at home.\n\n“It was worth it,” he said. “After all this segregation stuff I went through, I’d rather be here in America than anywhere else.”\n\nWhat I learned from interviewing hundreds of war veterans\n\nThey are heroes who seldom seek the limelight.\n\nMany of the hundreds of veterans I have interviewed wonder why I want to talk to them. Some start out by saying, \"Do you really think I have a story worth telling?\" It's mostly their friends and relatives who suggested I call.\n\nBut after listening to hundreds of stories of military service – from storming the beaches of Normandy during World War II or nearly freezing to death in the Korean War or getting a hand blown apart in Vietnam – I have found every word of great importance.\n\nListening to them, at times, has caused me to choke up as I typed their stories from the safety of our newsroom. Hearing such humility can do that.\n\nSo I’d very much like to take the credit for coming up with the idea of Saluting Our War Heroes, this weekly feature that has appeared almost every Monday since March 2010.\n\nBut I can’t.\n\nIt was late publisher and Air Force veteran Stan Lipsey’s idea to pay tribute to the many local veterans who put their lives on the line to preserve our freedom.\n\nIf not for the veterans, whether they served on the front lines or in support roles, I might not have been able to write this. The tyrants and dictators of the world despise freedom of the press. Our veterans willingly have and continue to take up the call to defend America where our First Amendment is a cherished right.\n\nAs a boy, I frequently quizzed my dad, a World War II veteran, about his war experiences. He never talked about the horrors he saw. Instead, he marveled at all the places his military service took him: northern Africa, Italy and the South Pacific by way of the Panama Canal. The closest he got to anything heavy was when he once told me, \"There are no atheists in foxholes.\"\n\nDecades later, when Lipsey suggested saluting local war heroes, I embraced the assignment, picking up where I'd left off with my father. It gave me a broader opportunity. I could talk to veterans from all the different wars and those who served in \"peaceful\" periods.\n\nOdd as it may sound, it provided me with a weekly respite from the mayhem of crime reporting. But I know why it worked for me: the veterans. They possess special qualities – gratitude that they survived, an enduring sense of loss for those who never made it home and a true appreciation for our country.\n\nNearly a decade later, The Buffalo News has published more than 475 pieces on veterans and turned the weekly feature into a book. The Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park also incorporated the salutes into a kiosk exhibit.\n\nThe plan initially was to write abbreviated portraits of each veteran, but it quickly became clear their stories deserved a more complete telling.\n\nIn 2015, Alvin Hardy told me that, as he charged to the shores in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, he was frightened but death never entered his thoughts.\n\n“There were five beaches, and we landed at Utah Beach. There was a lot of noise. All the shells going off and that stuff. Some of the soldiers were hit and floating in the water,” Hardy recalled. “You just kept on going forward.”\n\nNorman J. Zimmerman also remembered Normandy.\n\n“I landed seven days out from D-Day at Omaha Beach. It was very bad, very bad. There were a lot of dead soldiers. The Red Cross was there. We were in hurry to get out of there,” Zimmerman said four years ago.\n\nWeather dogged American troops in the Korean War. Vets who were no strangers to winter in Buffalo told me how they froze in a place called the Chosin Reservoir. That earned them a special name, the \"Chosen Frozen.”\n\n\"I ended up with frostbite, shrapnel in my left ankle, and my left knee was cracked when I got knocked down in an explosion,\" Tom Wagner told me in 2010.\n\nIn the 1960s, Americans were back in Asia, some 3,000 miles south of the Korean peninsula fighting in the jungles, rice paddies and highlands of Vietnam. Unlike other wars, this one turned into a political nightmare back home. There were major protests against the war and returning service members often suffered the brunt of the peace movement's anger.\n\nSometimes lost in the memories of those troubled times are the sacrifices of so many young Americans who willingly served. Chuck \"Sully\" Sullivan is one of them.\n\nSullivan lost his right hand and sight in his left eye when an enemy grenade he was disposing of prematurely exploded. That did not stop him from returning home and living a full life.\n\nHis indomitable spirit was on full display in April when he told of how doctors equipped him with a hook for everyday use and prosthetic hand for special events like weddings and funerals.\n\nThe doctors also wanted to outfit him with a glass eye, but he refused.\n\n“I said I have too much artificial stuff already. When they said I would one day scare my grandchildren with my blind eye, which looks a little funny, I told them, ‘I want to scare them,' ” he laughed.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, America went to war against terrorism. That took our troops to the searing deserts of the Middle East and unforgiving terrain of Afghanistan.\n\nRetired Air Force veteran Karen Schultz Chapman served not only in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but also the First Gulf War after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.\n\nProudly describing herself as a “grease monkey,” Schultz Chapman served in Afghanistan as a flight chief in charge of 40 mechanics who not only repaired A-10 Warthog attack jets but loaded them with bombs and 30 mm Gatling gun ammo.\n\nDescribing Afghanistan, Schultz Chapman said in 2018, \"You could see in the distance adobe homes with no electricity or running water. I would see people going down to the river and getting buckets of water.\n\n“At night, you would see fires going. You got a real good appreciation for being an American. When you see people living like that, you say, 'Wow, we do live in the greatest country.' \"\n\nSchultz Chapman is not alone in undertaking multiple deployments. Other members of the military in recent years repeatedly answered the call. Among them was Edwin L. Garris.\n\nHe served in the First Gulf War, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War. And you might say he was living the dream. Ever since his boyhood, he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his four older brothers, who were all members of the military.\n\nIn his deployment to the Iraq War, Garris told of how the enemy had taken to fighting unconventionally.\n\n\"The vehicle I was in was hit on different occasions by improvised explosive devices. It happened at least twice and we were able to push through. We were in an armored Humvee and that armor saved a lot of soldiers' lives,\" Garris recalled last year.\n\nAsked if he would deploy a fourth time, he answered without hesitation: \"My bag is always packed. I serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States.\"\n\nAs I mentioned, his and so many other patriotic stories might never have been told were it not for their families and friends encouraging them to share their experiences with me and other reporters.\n\nBut time has taken a toll with the passing of veterans, particularly from WWII, Korea and even Vietnam. We have fewer veterans. In Erie County, their numbers dropped by 28% from 2005 to 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.\n\nThe News remains committed to highlighting the stories of local veterans, though Saluting Our War Heroes will soon shift from weekly to monthly.\n\nSo keep sending us recommendations on veterans to feature at lmichel@buffnews.com or call me at 849-5594.\n\nWhat I've learned from interviewing hundreds of veterans is that their stories help us all understand the sacrifices they made.\n\nKorean War aerial gunner lost engine on very first mission\n\nMel Szymanski of Lancaster flew 28 missions during his time in the Air Force while serving in Korea, and documented every one them right after each bombing run.\n\nLike a meticulously kept diary, Szymanski \"penciled in\" details of the mission in blue or black ink and supplemented the narrative with photographs and maps, which he has kept in a binder for nearly seven decades.\n\n\"I kept notes after each mission,\" the 88-year-old veteran recalled recently at his dining room table inside a neat, yellow ranch house on a modest street lined with old oak trees.\n\n\"Each time we flew a mission, I penciled it in, the location, the date and the target as we went along. This was not something I did at the end. I had notes all the way through everything,\" Szymanski added.\n\nSzymanski confessed to having no idea why he was compelled to document everything, but it appears to comport with his basic character, even today.\n\n*******\n\nName: Mel Szymanski\n\nBirth date: Aug. 17, 1930\n\nHometown and residence: Lancaster\n\nBranch: Air Force and Air Force Reserves\n\nUnit: 343rd Bomb Wing Squadron\n\nOccupation: B-29 aerial gunner\n\nYears of Service: 1951 - 1955\n\nRank: Airman First Class/ Staff Sergeant\n\nMedals: Air Medal; Good Conduct Medal; National Defense Medal; Korean Service Medal; U.N. Service Medal; Republic of Korea Medal; New York State Conspicuous Service Cross; New York State Conspicuous Service Star; Gunner's Wing; Air Crew Member Wing.\n\n*******\n\nBorn in Depew – \"in a house, not a hospital,\" he stressed – Szymanski did not harbor dreams of flying an airplane while growing up. Still, the 1948 Depew High School graduate made the choice to enlist in the Air Force at the start of the Korean War.\n\n\"See, the Air Force did not draft. The other three branches were drafting at that time ... including the Navy and the Marine Corps. And I wanted to be in the Air Force,\" Szymanski recalled.\n\nAfter his eight weeks of basic training at Sampson Air Force Base, near Seneca Lake, south of Geneva, Szymanski was transferred to Lowery Air Force Base in Denver, Colo., in May 1951, where he initially trained to repair arsenals on B-29 planes but wound up becoming an aerial gunner aboard one instead.\n\n\"It was great,\" he said. \"I think I would have been very bored with my service time if I didn't fly. When you flew, you didn't know what you had to do during the day. You could wake up here and have dinner across the country, or stay there overnight or for a couple of days.\"\n\nSzymanski's first mission on Aug. 18, 1952, the day after his 22nd birthday, was among his most memorable – and dangerous. He and his crew took off in stormy weather at 9:20 p.m., headed for Nakwon, North Korea. About 5 miles from their target, they ran into intense anti-aircraft fire, which he meticulously documented hours after the mission.\n\nThe bomber plane took a direct hit to one of its engines, which lost all of its oil. The plane took more hits to its left engines and suffered damage to the fuselage. Upon returning to base, while over the Sea of Japan, the crew checked the bomb bays and discovered five unreleased bombs.\n\n\"We were unable to salvo them, so the central fire control gunner went into the bomb bay and stomped on them until they fell,\" Szymanski wrote at the time.\n\n\"It happens once in a while,\" Szymanski casually recalled almost 67 years later, sitting at his dining room table.\n\n\"I had to do that one time. You just hang on and stomp,\" he said.\n\nOn that first mission, his plane was diverted from Yokota Air Base in Japan, because of dense fog, and forced to land 35 miles away at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo with enough fuel for one landing attempt, which Szymanski described as scary. Ultimately, the plane landed safely about 10 hours after the start of the mission. Once they exited the aircraft, they discovered numerous holes and dents in the fuselage.\n\n\"One large hole was directly under my seat,\" Szymanski said. \"The plane was not flyable, so we were bused back to Yokota.\"\n\nNone of this gave him pause or caused him any trepidation about subsequent missions, said Szymanski, who was later dubbed \"the Polish Ace.\"\n\n\"When you're that young you don't really realize or think about the consequences. I mean, I was there. I did what I was supposed to do and when it was over, I'm still here, and I'm ready for the next one,\" Szymanski said.\n\n\"My whole life I just cross a bridge when I come to it and I don't think about it,\" he added.\n\nOne subsequent mission on Sept. 12, 1952, was especially deadly, when they lost three B-29 bombers during fighting near the infamous MiG Alley, the name given by the United Nations pilots during the Korean War to the northwest portion of North Korea, where the Yalu River empties into the Yellow Sea.\n\nOne of the three B-29 bombers was shot down over the Sui-ho power plant and dam in Yalu on the border between North Korea and China. Another suffered flak damage and crashed in South Korea, and the third disappeared without a trace.\n\n\"Yeah, we never knew what happened to it,\" said Szymanski.\n\nDuring a third memorable mission that took them back to the MiG Alley on Nov. 18, 1952, Szymanski lost two very good friends in battle, who were gunners on another plane.\n\nAbout MiG Alley, Szymanski said: \"You flew anywhere in there, you were in big danger from enemy aircraft, MiG fighters. We flew in there quite a few times.\"\n\nHis tour of duty ended in December 1952. Upon his return to the States, he and his unit were stationed outside of Sacramento, Calif. Then the whole unit was transferred to the air base in Mountain Home, Idaho, about 40 miles from Boise. There they were retrained to be atomic bomb carriers.\n\nAnother standout moment for Szymanski was seeing an atomic mushroom cloud.\n\n\"On March 17, 1952, my crew took part in an atomic bomb test at 5:20 a.m. at Yucca Flats, Nev. We flew at 20,000 feet altitude about a half-a-mile from ground zero. It was a terrific sight. The colors were very bright from one end of the spectrum to the other. The cloud must have risen 35,000 plus feet. We all wore dosimeters (to measure the radiation) on a cord around our necks, but we were never told how much radiation we were exposed to,\" he logged in his journal.\n\nSzymanski was discharged from the Air Force on March 19, 1955.\n\n\"My four years in active duty – I was one year in the Reserves – was like a high point in my life, to be honest. I don't ever regret being in. I'm proud of being in. It was a good part of my life,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know that I would ever want to do it again but, at the time, it was great. The fact that I'm still here talking about it made it greater,\" Szymanski added.\n\nAfter his service, Szymanski returned to his job as a research analyst at DuPont in Niagara Falls, where he remained for 11 years. He later sold insurance and worked at a chemical plating plant. In 1971, he went to work for Erie County in the Environment and Planning Department, from which he retired after 25 years in 1995.\n\nHis wife of 54 years, Barbara, died in 2011. The couple had three daughters and a son. His eldest daughter also died several years ago, Szymanski said.\n\nAside from his journal and flight logs, the most memorable things from his time in the Air Force was the camaraderie he developed with his fellow gunners, Szymanski said.\n\nYou took care of each other. You did everything together. My crew was together for better than three years, basically the same 11 guys all the time,\" he said, adding that some became lifelong friends.\n\n\"The gunners were like brothers. The rest of the crew was more like cousins,\" he said.\n\nTheft of cow in Vietnam War gave vet chance to right a wrong\n\nAfter graduating high school in a small town near the Delaware Water Gap in New Jersey, Daniel Figueroa wanted to expand his horizons.\n\nWhen a buddy suggested they enlist in the Army, Figueroa said he was on board.\n\n“I enlisted the next day, but he didn’t,” said Figueroa, who was 18 at the time. Why his friend put it off, he does not know, but he says he is glad he didn’t wait.\n\nIf he’d delayed and gone in with his friend a couple of years later, Figueroa says he might have been wounded with his buddy in Vietnam.\n\n“My friend got pretty banged up with shrapnel,” said Figueroa, who served in Vietnam but was spared battlefield wounds.\n\nHis first stop with the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division was helping quell the Dominican Republic’s civil war in the spring of 1965. He was familiar with the Caribbean, having lived in Puerto Rico until he was 9, when his parents moved to the states.\n\nWhen his commanding officer realized he could speak Spanish, Figueroa’s bilingual abilities were put to work as an interpreter.\n\nThat did not spare him from the hazards of war.\n\n“We were assigned to Santo Domingo to take back the government. We were going house to house searching and I kicked in a door and shot and killed a man who came at me,” Figueroa said.\n\nAfter three months, he returned to the United States, but not for long.\n\n“On Christmas Eve in 1965 I was in Saigon. It was hot and humid,” Figueroa said. “My mother was worried because my older brother was also in Vietnam with the 25th Infantry Division.”\n\nFigueroa says he never had the chance to utilize his parachuting skills in Vietnam, but he and other members of the 82nd 1st Cavalry played a role in the aerial side of the war.\n\n“We would send out spotters and then radio in the location of the enemy so that our planes could bomb them,” Figueroa said.\n\nThe unit also assisted patrols that came under enemy attack.\n\n“We’d go out when patrols got in trouble. One time I remember that we had to keep on firing our weapons all night just to stay alive,” he said. “We’d gone out too far into a rice paddy and were surrounded by the enemy. The enemy kept coming at us all night. Some of our soldiers were killed.”\n\nAt dawn, another unit arrived and pushed back the enemy to allow the pinned down units to escape.\n\n“That showed me what life was all about and I appreciated it more,” he said.\n\nEven though he was in a war zone, Figueroa demonstrated his sense of right from wrong.\n\n“One time when we went into this village, a soldier stole a cow from an old man. I put my rifle in the face of the soldier and told him to give the cow back. He said, ‘But we’re going to have steaks tonight.’ I said, ‘No, we’re not. Give the cow the back. We didn’t come here to steal from people.’ ”\n\nHonorably discharged in 1967, Figueroa worked in Princeton, N.J., for a manufacturer of cameras utilized in the nation’s space program. Two years later, he received word that Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna was hiring.\n\n“I took a chance and drove up on a Friday and by Tuesday I was working at Bethlehem Steel,” he said.\n\nThe ambitious war veteran advanced from laborer to crane operator at Bethlehem. In his personal life, he married the former Elba Rivera of Buffalo’s West Side. They would go on to raise three children.\n\nWhen layoffs hit the steel plant around 1971, Figueroa decided to follow a friend’s advice and move to California, where police departments were hiring Spanish-speaking individuals.\n\n“But there was a knock at my door. It was someone from the Veterans Administration saying that the Buffalo Police Department was looking for bilingual officers. There were no Spanish-speaking officers.\n\n“I took the test and came on first as a peace officer. It was myself, George Melendez and Raul Russi. We were the first Hispanic officers.”\n\nAmong his proudest moments as a police officer was when he saved a man who jumped into the Erie Basin Marina in a suicide attempt.\n\n“I jumped into the water and my partner threw me a rope and we got the guy out. The police commissioner gave me a medal for that,” Figueroa said.\n\nAnother proud moment happened when he was assigned to a security detail protecting President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, during a Buffalo visit.\n\n“I got separate pictures of myself with the president and with his wife,” Figueroa said.\n\nIn 2006, Figueroa retired as a detective sergeant from the homicide squad.\n\nService in the military and Buffalo Police, he says, has provided him with lots of memories.\n\n“My military experience taught me how to survive,” Figueroa said. “As a police officer, I helped everybody, whether it was a junkie or anyone who needed help. That gave me satisfaction.”\n\n*****\n\nDaniel Figueroa, 74\n\nHometown: Cidra, Puerto Rico\n\nResidence: Buffalo\n\nBranch: Army\n\nRank: Spec. 4\n\nWar zone: Vietnam\n\nYears of service: Enlisted, 1964 – 1967\n\nMost prominent honors: Vietnam Campaign Medal, Good Conduct Medal\n\nSpecialty: Infantry and paratrooper\n\nAmherst veteran glad he served in desegregated armed forces\n\nJames R. Heck III of Amherst served two years as an Army officer, but never saw any combat.\n\nThe 87-year-old retired Buffalo Public School administrator served in the military during a peaceful period, between the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam.\n\nFor Heck, it was a good time to be in the Army.\n\nAside from the country being at peace, when Heck arrived at Fort Benning, Ga., it had been a little less than a decade since President Harry S. Truman had desegregated the armed forces. African-American soldiers could serve right alongside their white counterparts.\n\n\"I enjoyed my military service. I really did not see any overt prejudice or segregation because Harry Truman made sure of it when he wrote that order. When you get an order from the commander-in-chief, the president of the United States, you damn well better obey it. OK?\"\n\nHeck said his brother, Rhomie Jr., who is six years older, was not quite so lucky.\n\n\"See, my brother was drafted in 1942, I think it was. You had no choice. When you became 18, in his case, automatically, you went in because World War II was on,\" Heck said.\n\n\"My brother fought in a segregated army. I don't think I would have fought in a segregated army, because it's so wrong and so stupid. My brother said the only time he saw white soldiers was when he saw the white officers who were over them in his company. I don't think my temperament would have allowed me to do that,\" he added.\n\nHeck recalled hearing about his Uncle Harry who voluntarily enlisted in the Army during World War I and served in a segregated unit while stationed in France.\n\n\"In France, black soldiers could fight side by side with French soldiers against Germans, but they could not fight side by side with white American soldiers. That doesn't calculate in my head and, if it doesn't, I can't go along with it, I just can't participate in that. I think I would have done a Muhammad Ali,\" Heck said, referring to the black heavyweight boxing champion who famously refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War in 1967.\n\n\"Or, I would have fled to Canada,\" he added.\n\nBorn in Lynchburg, Va., in 1931, Heck was no stranger to segregation. The youngest of four children, he was raised in Suffolk, Va., until he was 11 years old, when his father, a minister, took an assignment at a church in Carlisle, Pa.. Before the move, Heck said his father sat his children down for a talk.\n\n\"He said: 'I want you to know something. You're not going from Suffolk, Virginia, to the land of freedom, where black folks are free to do whatever they want.' He said, 'there isn't much difference between Suffolk, Virginia, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania,' and he was absolutely right,\" Heck recalled.\n\n\"I went to a segregated school in Suffolk and I went to a segregated elementary school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The only reason I went to a white high school is because there was only one in town,\" Heck said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Heck attended West Virginia State College, then a historically black institution.\n\n\"At West Virginia (State), you had to spend your freshman and sophomore years in Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC. That was required for male students,\" Heck said.\n\n\"Then, after spending two years in the ROTC, you might as well go ahead do the other two years and graduate with your commission as second lieutenant. You get your second lieutenant bars and your degree at the same time. My degree was in business administration,\" he said.\n\nAfter graduating from West Virginia State College in 1955, he was assigned to the 39th Field Artillery Battalion at Fort Benning. Heck was able to enter the Army as a junior officer.\n\nRight before he entered the Army, Heck had married Shirley Johnson of Buffalo, who he had met at West Virginia State.\n\nHeck never served overseas while in the Army. After his discharge in 1957, Heck and his wife settled in Buffalo.\n\nHeck spent two years active duty in the Army Reserves after his discharge.\n\n\"I had to serve another 6 years, either in the active reserves or inactive. I chose not to be active, but I could have been called back to war, back to duty, anytime during that six-year period. That was a part of my contract as result of my participation in ROTC and becoming an officer,\" said Heck.\n\n\"That was a good plan, because you had a ready-made Army waiting. All you had to do was reactivate them. A lot of my friends stayed in the active reserves while holding another job,\" he added.\n\nAfter a stint operating a grocery store and selling real estate, Heck earned degrees in elementary education from Buffalo State College and began teaching at School 78, before becoming director of school integration for the Buffalo School District in 1972.\n\nDuring that period, Heck remembered meeting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when the civil rights leader spoke in 1967 at Kleinhans Music Hall.\n\nHeck said he believes everyone between the ages of 18 and 25 should be be required to spend some time serving in the military.\n\n\"Including the sons of the top 2 percent and 10 percent, or whatever,\" said Heck.\n\n\"There should be no outs for anyone. You shouldn't be able to buy your way out of that service. The reason I feel that way is because that's what you call equality. People of different races, backgrounds, ethnicities get to know each other. It's such a pattern for life. You'd have less racial strife, in my opinion. You would learn discipline. You would learn duty, and you would learn about other people,\" Heck added.\n\n****\n\nName: James R. Heck III\n\nAge: 87\n\nHometown: Suffolk, Va.\n\nResidence: Amherst\n\nBranch: U.S. Army\n\nRank: First Lieutenant\n\nAssignment: 39th Field Artillery Battalion\n\nYears of service: 1955 to 1957\n\nVietnam War vet never stopped serving his native Tonawanda\n\nWayne Baumgartner enlisted in the U.S. Air Force right out of Kenmore East High School and served his country for nearly eight years.\n\nBut he hasn't ever really stopped serving.\n\nBaumgartner, who was a staff sergeant in the Air Force and Vietnam War veteran, has continued his work for the greater good in several capacities in his native Town of Tonawanda.\n\n\"We owe it to the country to serve,\" said Baumgartner, 75, who is the chairman of the Town of Tonawanda's Community Emergency Response Team and a longtime leader of the American Legion Milton J. Brounshidle Post 205 in Kenmore.\n\nBaumgartner joined the Air Force out of high school in July 1961 and worked at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station. He joined with two high school friends who \"didn't make it six months,\" he said. Baumgartner largely served as an administrative specialist, including a two-year tour in Germany. He reenlisted early at Niagara Falls in 1965. A year later he was sent to Vietnam.\n\n\"Vietnam was just building up around '64-'65, and I went in '66. I didn’t think they needed administrative people over there as much as fighting soldiers, so it was a surprise,\" Baumgartner said. \"I was kind of excited in a way. I wasn’t looking for a way out, I wanted to experience it firsthand, and I don’t regret going.\"\n\nBaumgartner was based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, a Republic of Vietnam Air Force base near Saigon in South Vietnam. It was a major base for the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War.\n\nHis duties involved documenting plane and troop movements in and out of the country. There were 10 Air Force detachments in Vietnam, and each had to account for itself via monthly reports. Sometimes, a detachment wouldn't send their information to the base, and Baumgartner would travel around the country to retrieve the report.\n\n\"If they didn't send them in, I'd have to hop on a plane and go get them,\" he said.\n\nOne time that meant a trip to Tay Ninh, a base about 60 miles northwest of Saigon. He was transported on an Army Caribou cargo plane.\n\n\"The pilot told me he'd be there 20 minutes, so I told him I could probably run there and run back in five minutes,\" Baumgartner said. \"I get to the building, and I hear them taking off. I was stranded overnight. There wasn't a plane until noon the next day.\"\n\nThere was only a four-person detachment at Tay Ninh. The group decided to head into town.\n\n\"We're driving along in our blue Air Force truck, and the side mirror gets shot out,\" Baumgartner said. \"He kept driving like it was a daily thing. It didn't faze them at all, they said it happens all the time. All I had was a 30-caliber revolver with six rounds. That’s all they give you when you leave the base.\"\n\n•••\n\nWayne Baumgartner, 75\n\nHometown: Town of Tonawanda\n\nResidence: Town of Tonawanda\n\nBranch: Air Force\n\nRank: Staff sergeant\n\nSpecialty: Administrative specialist\n\nWar zone: Vietnam\n\nYears of service: 1961-69\n\nMost prominent honors: Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Good Conduct Medal with one oak leaf cluster (which represents a second award), Republic of Vietnam Medal\n\n•••\n\nBaumgartner is proudest of his Air Force commendation medal, awarded to members of the Air Force who distinguish themselves by meritorious achievement and service.\n\nBecause he reenlisted early, his service amounted to less than eight years. He served seven years, seven months and seven days.\n\n\"I wouldn’t change it for the world,\" Baumgartner said of his military career. \"Military people are a different breed. They have your back, all the time. It could be a stranger you don’t know, but if you need something, bingo, you’ve got it.\"\n\nAfter his military service, Baumgartner worked two years as a steamfitter apprentice before working for J.C. Penney in the Boulevard Mall for 35 years, retiring as a maintenance stock manager. He and his wife of 57 years, Sandra, raised two daughters and three sons, including two who followed their father into public service: David, a recently retired Town of Tonawanda police captain, and Michael, the supervisor of the Town of Tonawanda's paramedics.\n\nThroughout his post-military career and his retirement, Baumgartner has been active in the community. He is a 50-year member at Brounshidle Post, where he served as commander. He has been involved in post fundraisers, including efforts to provide Christmas gifts to needy veteran families.\n\nAs the chairman of the Town of Tonawanda's community emergency response team program, Baumgartner heads the initiative that has educated 500 residents about disaster preparedness and trains them in basic disaster response, including skills in fire safety, search and rescue and extrication. The program has 137 active members.\n\n\"We train people to take care of themselves, and each other,\" said Baumgartner, who also organizes the annual charity hockey game between the town's police and firemen.\n\nBaumgartner's two paths of service came together this summer when he was honored by State Sen. Chris Jacobs as part of the Veteran of the Month program. He was told there would be a group picture during the event and to bring some of his formal military wear.\n\n\"We were having a legion family picnic, and I'm running it, making all of this food, and someone says change for the picture,\" he said. \"I walk out there, the senator is there, my family and everyone. It was quite a surprise.\"\n\nWorld War II vet James T. Kelley Sr.: 'I just liked the Navy'\n\nJames T. Kelley Sr. has a warm smile that quickly turns to laughter.\n\nIt is a character trait that appears to have served Kelley well throughout his 93 years and, including his two years in the Navy during World War II and 1 1/2 years in the Navy during the Korean War.\n\n\"I just liked the Navy — the water, the boat, the camaraderie,\" Kelley explained.\n\nA lifelong South Buffalonian, Kelley attributes his affinity for most things marine-related to having grown up near Buffalo Creek and not far from the Buffalo River. In fact, he was ready to enlist in the Marines soon after the United States entered World War II on Dec. 7, 1941. The problem was, he was only 16.\n\n\"The neighborhood guys were all looking to join and did, but my dad was adamant that I finish high school first,\" said Kelley.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 1943, Kelley went to work for Worthington Pump on Roberts Avenue off Clinton Street, until he was drafted the following year. He and a few other guys from his neighborhood went downtown to the U.S. Post Office on Ellicott Street, determined to enlist in the Marines.\n\nUnfortunately, the Marine recruiters informed Kelley that they had already filled their quota of volunteers. So he went to another line and a Navy recruiter approached him.\n\n“The officer says to me, ‘I hear you want to be a Marine.’ I told him all about how I grew up near the Buffalo Creek and in the river. So I said, ‘If I had my druthers, I’d rather be in the Navy.’ He took me down, put me in line and said, ‘Put this lad in the Navy' and, bingo, I was in,” Kelley cheerfully recalled.\n\nKelley said it was a bittersweet moment seeing his high school sweetheart and future wife, Rose Marie Esposito, and her father in the distance from a train window as he rolled off to his new adventure.\n\n\"We were leaving from the depot down in lower Main Street, and the train ran by my father-in-law's outdoor market, and they were out there waving to me when I was going to boot camp,\" Kelley said.\n\nAfter his training as a Navy electrician, Kelley wound up as a gunner aboard a small warship sailing with much larger destroyers in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Japan. He said his most tense moment of combat was firing at an enemy plane that seemed determined not to go down.\n\n\"It was zeroing in on our ship, and I could see the tracer bullets from the gunfire. There was a period of time there where I wondered, why doesn't it fall? Why doesn't it stop?\" said Kelley.\n\nBoth exhilarated and scared, he watched as the plane flew closer towards the ship. Though only minutes had passed, it seemed like an eternity before it fell.\n\n\"Eventually, about one or two football fields away, boom! It was in the ocean,\" Kelley recalled.\n\nKelley returned to the States and was discharged in 1946. He married Esposito the following year. They had two children, a girl and a boy, before the Navy recalled him, much to his wife's chagrin.\n\nThis time, Kelley ended up spending most of his time in Europe and at ports in the United States.\n\n“It was like a vacation, that year-and-a-half,” he said.\n\n“Oh, I went to Cherbourg, France. I ended up in Paris, down to Portugal and got up to see — what’s the shrine there? — Our Lady of Fatima,” said Kelley. “Why the ship went there or why it went to Cherbourg, I have no idea.”\n\nWhen his tour was up, the ship's commander tried to talk Kelley into signing up for another four years in the Navy.\n\n\"I liked the service. My wife changed my mind. 'You come home,' she told me,\" Kelley said.\n\nKelley went to work for the Buffalo Fire Department and the couple had two more daughters.\n\nKelley also moonlighted as a counselor for the Father Baker orphanage in Lackawanna. He retired from the fire department in 1983 after 27 years. He also worked for the New York State Office of General Services. But he still found time for recreational sports.\n\n“I love to play ball, softball. I played a lot of softball. Up until I was 50, I played three nights a week. I played for different taverns,” Kelley said.\n\nA catcher, Kelley was inducted into the Western New York Softball Hall of Fame in 1983.\n\nHe and his wife were married 69 years until her death in April 2017. Kelley's son, veteran Buffalo News sportswriter Jim Kelley, died in 2010.\n\nHe is still cherished and doted on by his three daughters, Cathy Dengler, Carol Murphy and Karen Heck, six grandchildren and several great- grandchildren.\n\n\"I've been very fortunate in my life,\" Kelley said.\n\n• • • • •\n\nJames T. Kelley Sr., 93\n\nHometown: South Buffalo\n\nResidence: South Buffalo\n\nBranch: Navy\n\nRank: Electrician Mate 2nd Class\n\nWar zone: Pacific in WWII, Europe during Korean War\n\nYears of service: 1944 - 1946, 1951 - 1953\n\nMost prominent honors: Silver Star\n\nAngola vet recalls Battle of Soui Tre in Vietnam\n\nThe Battle of Soui Tre was one of the most intense, one-day battles fought in Vietnam.\n\nIt started in the early morning hours of March 21, 1967, as a search and destroy mission by U.S. military forces in the Tay Ninh Province of South Vietnam.\n\nEugene Hackemer, of Angola, was 18 years old, having enlisted in the Army only a few months earlier, after dropping out of Lake Shore High School. Hackemer was now a member of a mechanized infantry unit that was mainly charged with repairing and maintaining armored personnel carriers.\n\nWhile Hackemer was back at the base, a night patrol operating outside the defensive perimeter reported waves of Viet Cong infantry firing off weapons.\n\n\"One of our artillery units was getting overrun...and we were called out about maybe 4:30, 5 o'clock in the morning, to help,\" Hackemer recalled. \"They needed a lot of help there.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. forces having several 105-caliber howitzers pointed directly at the enemy, the Viet Cong just kept coming, Hackemer said.\n\n\"They were just coming from everywhere, they said. And they were kind of hollering all over the radio. So it was kind of bothering us guys that we couldn't get there quick enough. Then we ran into an armored outfit and we were stuck in the woods. We had to get around them, their tanks, and they were having a hell of a time getting through the woods,\" said Hackemer.\n\n\"When we broke the wood line, which was about, maybe, an hour later from where their position was, man, they were everywhere. They had jets already called in, helicopters coming in. There were gunships,\" he added.\n\nThe American forces eventually overtook the enemy and claimed nearly 650 Viet Cong casualties. Thirty-six U.S. servicemen were killed in the battle and 190 were wounded.\n\nThough combat was all around him throughout his time in Vietnam, the Battle of Soui Tre was the most memorable event, Hackemer said.\n\n\"It made the newspapers,\" he said of the battle. \"It stayed with me for a long time.\"\n\nHackemer said his early days upon returning to the United States also stuck with him.\n\n\"Afterwards, when we came home I was stationed in Fort Meade, Md., where they sent us to Washington, D.C., during the riots. Being back from Vietnam and seeing all this was horrifying,\" he said.\n\nHackemer met his wife, Barbara, at Fort Meade. They were married in 1968.\n\n\"We had two little girls. One's 49 years old now. She was born on my birthday, so that was kind of cool,\" said Hackemer. \"My other daughter was born with a cranium bifida and she has passed away since then. She had a lot of problems.\"\n\nHackemer thinks his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange may have contributed to his daughter having been born with the condition. He believes the herbicide may also have been responsible for his own health battles.\n\n\"I had a heart attack already about five years ago and they believe it was from Agent Orange. It was the same kind of heart attacks that a lot of veterans were having after they came back from Vietnam. So I get a little bit of a pension from them for that. I have post-traumatic stress. I get that. Yeah, it was quite an experience being in the military,\" Hackemer said.\n\nAfter 28 years in the track maintenance division of South Buffalo Railway, Hackemer is retired.\n\n\"I've been retired for about 20 years now. I got off when I was about 48 years old. I'm 69 now,\" Hackemer said.\n\nMuch of his time since retirement has been spent at the American Legion Post 928 in Derby, where he served as commander from 2007 to 2014.\n\n\"Some guys I met, we all joined the post and started marching with them and going to parades and what not,\" Hackemer said.\n\nAt first he was drawn by the easy camaraderie, which grew into an abiding concern about veteran issues.\n\n\"You see (volunteer) firemen who join fire companies. They stay with them forever. And we kind of do the same thing, us guys in the military. We kind of like to stick together. We all talk the same way. We have the same lingo. We still laugh about different things that happened to all of us and we all went through it. It kind of brings back memories. And, yet, you talk to them, seriously – when it got serious – you also knew problems were occurring with some and we could help them, you know,\" said Hackemer.\n\nAs his interest grew, so did his penchant for taking on leadership roles.\n\n\"That's what kind of made me go for commander in American Legion in Derby. It was a new building. They were just about bankrupt and I got about seven or eight guys to come along with me, a bunch of volunteers, and we went in and kind took over the whole post and got it on its own feet. Now I'm helping a VFW post for the same reason. They were closed and I got them back open again,\" Hackemer said.\n\n\"I guess you would call it a never-ending battle with helping each other out here,\" he added.\n\n****\n\nEugene \"Babe\" Hackemer, 69\n\nHometown and residence: Angola\n\nBranch: Army\n\nRank: SP5\n\nWar zone: War Zone C, Vietnam, Battle of Soui Tre\n\nYears of service: Enlisted December 1966 - December 1968\n\nMost prominent honors: Presidential Unit Citation, Army Commendation Medal\n\nSpecialty: Mechanized infantry division\n\nHolocaust survivor was drafted by U.S. Army to fight the Nazis\n\nIn the late 1930s, Stephan H. Lewy and other Jewish kids were once locked in a Berlin synagogue by Nazi soldiers who cut a gas line, leaving the children to die and suffocate. An older boy helped save them.\n\nFearing for his life, Lewy embarked on a nearly 4,000-mile journey in 1939 after obtaining safe passage on a Kindertransport to France, and eventually a visa to the United States.\n\nHe was just one of tens of thousands of German Jews seeking refuge across the Atlantic. But he didn’t realize he’d soon be traveling back to Europe to fight against the Nazis.\n\n“I got a letter from Uncle Sam,” Lewy, now 93, said.\n\nAfter arriving in New York City, Lewy was drafted and sent across the ocean as an interpreter and interrogator in the U.S. Army’s 6th Armored Division.\n\nHe didn’t want to go back. Lewy had been forced out of his Berlin school because he was Jewish. His father, Arthur, had been taken to a concentration camp in 1933.\n\n“We just had to make sure that we stayed alive,” recalled Lewy, during a recent interview at the Montabaur Heights senior living facility in Clarence, where he resides.\n\nLewy was terrified about returning to Europe in 1944. But he would help liberate the infamous Buchenwald death camp and later be honored as a war hero.\n\nThe 6th Armored Division was a personal favorite of Gen. George S. Patton. It landed on Utah Beach in war-ravaged Europe shortly after D-Day, and the Army warned Lewy to be careful. If he was captured as a refugee by a Nazi officer, he would be sent straight to a concentration camp.\n\n“Some of our soldiers, German refugees like myself, were caught in battles. And some of them didn’t make it,” he said. But Lewy was never recognized, and lucky.\n\nHis division cut across France, south of Paris. It would eventually cross the Maginot Line into Germany during the late fall of 1944. Lewy’s division fought on the front line amid gunfire and bombings, and he spoke to German prisoners captured by American forces.\n\nIt became an art in identification. Lewy was trained to match German insignia to different generals, battles and injuries. By looking at a uniform’s patch, he could provide a brief history on any given soldier.\n\nHe would often travel by Jeep, and as the “Super Sixth” division pushed through Germany, soldiers would offer civilians chocolate or cigarettes.\n\nEverything changed when he reached Buchenwald.\n\nBuchenwald, or Konzentrationslager in German, was one of the largest concentration camps in the country, just northwest of Weimar. Lewy’s division was the first to reach it.\n\n“We forced them to bury the people that were killed by the Germans,” Lewy said of the camp's civilians, who claimed they had no idea Jews were being killed in Buchenwald.\n\nLewy and the rest of the division found emaciated, dying Jewish prisoners. Young Elie Wiesel was there. He would later document the moment in his book, “Night.” Soon after being liberated, Wiesel looked at himself in a mirror. A corpse looked back, he wrote.\n\n“It’s a very difficult situation. Because you are angry, and you want to do something about it,” Lewy said. “And on the other side, they were denying it existed. So it was an internal battle.”\n\nHe shipped back to the United States after the war and was reunited with his his stepmother, Johanna, and his father, Arthur, who had escaped a concentration camp after suffering a heart attack in 1933.\n\nLewy attended Northeastern University, married his love, Frances, and worked for years as an accountant.\n\nBut he has never forgotten the bloodshed. And he has never forgotten Buchenwald.\n\n****\n\nStephan H.

Harvey, 81\n\nHometown: Niagara Falls\n\nResidence: Town of Lockport\n\nBranch: Marine Corps\n\nRank: corporal\n\nWar zone: Korean War\n\nYears of service: enlisted, February 1952 - February 1955\n\nMost prominent honors: Purple Heart, Combat Infantry Badge, Korean War Medal\n\nSpecialty: infantry, and drum and bugle corps\n\nAs they climbed down rope cargo nets on the side of the troop ship, the sergeant barked at the Marines.\n\n“Don’t look down and don’t step on your buddies hands below you.”\n\nEighteen-year-old Chuck W. Harvey, carrying all of his fighting gear on his back, managed to follow orders and dropped into a landing craft without incident.\n\nHe was one of 5,000 Marines arriving on Feb. 5, 1953, at Incheon, South Korea, to fight against the North Koreans and Chinese in the Korean War.\n\nHarvey’s heart was torn.\n\n“Every Marine received advanced combat training, but I played the trumpet and had also received four months of training with a drum and bugle corps. Four or five day before we landed, I was told I was going to be transferred to a front-line outfit.”\n\nAs the landing craft motored toward shore, Harvey realized he might never return home to Niagara Falls.\n\n“I had quit Gaskill Junior High School when I was 16 to become a baker at Niagara Fancy Bakery on East Falls Street but it didn’t work out and I went back to school for a short time. I quit school again to join the Marine Corps.”\n\nHe remembers what the school principal told him.\n\n“He put his arm around my shoulders and said, ‘You know, Charles, this isn’t what an educator is supposed to say, but I think this is the best selection for you.’ It was comforting to hear that. I was still basically a kid.”\n\nHarvey’s mother, Harriet, had signed the early enlistment papers so he could join at 17.\n\nOnce ashore at Incheon, he and the other Marines boarded a northbound train “headed as far as the train could take us to the front lines.”\n\nThen they climbed into northbound trucks covered with green canvas roofs.\n\nOn the way, he started talking to another 18 year old, Herbie Moore from Wisconsin. It was the start of a lifelong friendship.\n\n“When we got out of the trucks, we walked and all I could hear was artillery, machine guns and mortars. The mortars were the worst damn things,” Harvey said.\n\nMembers of “Item Company,” 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Harvey and Moore climbed a steep hill to their bunker, relying on a rope so that they would not lose their footing in the mud and darkness.\n\nInside the bunker, Harvey and Moore made friends with other Marines and familiarized themselves with the 3.5 rocket launchers they would be operating.\n\n“We would climb out of the bunker and over the top of the hill and into the trenches on the front lines. We were multi-taskers. We replenished ammo, fired our rocket launchers and repaired our bunkers,” Harvey said of the combat routine.\n\nDaytime was rough, but nighttime was even worse.\n\n“We’d go out on night patrols and it was hard to see.”\n\nThat, he said, increased the chances of stepping on less-than-lethal “shoe box mines” intended to blow off a foot or break a leg.\n\n“The enemy knew if they just injured a Marine, three or four others would come to his assistance and do whatever they could.”\n\nThe enemy also sought kills with “Bouncing Betty” land mines.\n\n“The shrapnel hit you in the stomach,” Harvey explained. “You were cognizant of these things, but you couldn’t let it interfere with what you had to do.”\n\nThere were different types of night patrols.\n\n“In combat patrols, we went out looking for trouble, in reconnaissance patrols we gathered information and we also had listening patrols. You could literally hear the enemy talking,” he said. “We could also smell them sometimes. They ate garlic and smoked opium.”\n\nOccasionally, Harvey said, all was quiet “and you could almost rest and that was a blessing.”\n\nToward the end of his war duty in July 1953, he recalled catching a break with mess hall duty. But it was short lived. He remembers the night of July 8.\n\n“We had just gone to sack, maybe 11, 11:30, and we could hear our guys firing 4.5 Charlie rockets at the enemy and the rockets were going over our tents. Whatever was happening, it wasn’t good.”\n\nSuddenly somebody ran into the mess hall crew’s tent.\n\n“‘Grab your weapons, we’re going up.’ We boarded the trucks and the road we took was ‘76 Alley.’ That was the weapon the Chinese fired at us and they were accurate.”\n\nOne of the guns knocked out the truck in front of Harvey’s and in a flash, he and other Marines leaped into a nearby rice paddy.\n\n“You just react. That’s what adrenaline and training can do.”\n\nThey continued on foot.\n\n“A lieutenant took charge and a bunch of us were taken to outposts Berlin and East Berlin. They’d been run over by thousands of Chinese.”\n\nA combination of artillery, mortars and additional troops succeeded in pushing back the enemy, although it was far from safe.\n\n“I was on Outpost Berlin and the word was passed to ‘fix bayonets.’ That’s when everything I had experienced up to 18 years old was going through my head at a billion miles an hour. I’m saying to myself, ‘I’m not going home.’” But Harvey was spared hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese did not return.\n\nYet Harvey was not out of the woods.\n\nIn mid-July 1953, he was back on the front lines.\n\n“We knew the armistice was going to be signed and the position we were holding was the gateway to Seoul and the Chinese wanted to break through it,” Harvey said of a last advance expected by the enemy.\n\nOn the night of July 19, he felt the brunt of it while out on patrol.\n\n“In a heartbeat, I thought the world was coming to an end. Several rounds were landing per second. I went flying through the air and my rifle was gone. Shrapnel hit my right leg. I was bleeding from my ears from the force of the concussions,” he said, overcome with tears from that 63-year-old memory. “We managed to crawl into a bunker.”\n\nEventually, his patrol was rescued.\n\nAfter recuperating, Harvey received orders to return to his unit on Aug. 2, which was several days after the war had ended.\n\n“I was waiting for a truck to take me and I heard all this racket and I asked someone what was going on. It was the drum and bugle corps practicing. So I got permission and went over to see them. All my buddies in it asked where I’d been.”\n\nHarvey shared his war stories and the corps’ sergeant, whom he knew all the way back to his days at boot camp on Parris Island, asked if he would like to return to the music-making unit.\n\n“I said ‘yes.’ It was about the best thing that could happen to me under the circumstances. There was good food, you could drink beer and watch USO shows.”\n\nAnd while that may sound like a happy ending, Harvey says he has suffered from post-traumatic stress from his war experiences throughout life.\n\n“I see my behavior specialist at a VA clinic in Lockport and he helps me talk things out,” the 81-year-old bachelor said. “It’s difficult, but it is very comforting.”\n\nemail: lmichel@buffnews.com\n\nLives of two Buffalo sailors converged on the ill-fated USS Indianapolis\n\nThe Rev. Thomas M. Conway survived the Japanese torpedoes that sank the USS Indianapolis in the waning days of World War II, and he and other survivors floated in the Pacific Ocean waiting for rescuers. He died on the third day.\n\nCrewmate Frank J. Lucca also survived the attack, and after four days adrift, he and 315 other survivors were rescued.\n\nThe Navy records 883 crew members of the Indianapolis killed in the initial sinking or dying in the days later, waiting for rescue.\n\nNext month, a Hollywood movie will tell the story of the sea disaster, and how naval brass turned the skipper, Capt. Charles Butler McVay III, into a scapegoat. “USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage” is set to be released on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, starring Nicolas Cage as the captain.\n\nConway and Lucca are Buffalo’s connections to the story. Father Conway, a Connecticut native and the son of Irish immigrants, served in the Buffalo Catholic Diocese before joining the Navy.\n\nLucca was from an Italian family on the West Side. After the war, he returned to Buffalo, married and raised a family. He died in 1999, with his three grown children at his bedside, at the age of 73.\n\nConway is memorialized with a South Buffalo park named after him and records of his military service and sacrifice in the diocesan archives.\n\nTheir stories converge on the tragedy of the Indianapolis.\n\nThe 610-foot cruiser had been on a secret mission to deliver the final components for the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. Three days later, when the second bomb hit Nagasaki, the war was over.\n\nBut the USS Indianapolis had already been sunk.\n\nTwo torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck the ship late Sunday night July 30, 1945, in the Philippine Sea. At least 300 crew members were killed immediately. An estimated 900 others, including Conway and Lucca, escaped the ship before it sank 12 minutes later.\n\nLucca was topside when the torpedoes struck, and he was able to abandon ship as the cruiser quickly sank. He stayed afloat with a life belt, and in the days after, resisted drinking saltwater as the unrelenting sun beat down. Others did not resist, and they paid the consequences.\n\nAs survivors bobbed about in the shark-infested waters wearing life jackets and life belts, clinging to debris and sharing the few life rafts floating atop the oil-slickened water, Conway plied about offering hope and prayers to the groups of sailors over three days before his strength gave out.\n\nOn Aug. 3, a pilot spotted the survivors, and the rescue operation began.\n\nFrank Lucca\n\nHalfway through his 16th year, Lucca tried to enlist, but the Navy rejected him because he was too skinny. The 5-foot-4 teenager ate pasta and bananas for a year. The Navy liked the results and with parental permission, he set off to sea.\n\nLucca’s cousin, Fran Lucca, also was in the Navy during World War II, serving aboard the USS Burrows DE 105. The cousins crossed path in August of 1945, 10 days before the Indianapolis sank, but they did not see other.\n\nFran Lucca, now 91, shared letters with The Buffalo News that he wrote from Pearl Harbor to his parents. They help to tell the Indianapolis’ story.\n\nIn one dated July 20, 1945, Fran Lucca wrote:\n\n“As we were pulling into port today, a slick and powerful heavy cruiser zoomed past us very close ... and I looked at the number and guess whose ship it was? None other than Frankie Lucca, Uncle John’s kid. He’s tied up a little way from us and I’ll try to get in touch with him. It sure will be swell seeing him again. Tell Uncle John that I will try.”\n\nFive days later, Fran sent another letter updating his parents: “I tried to contact Frank Lucca. My signalman sent word that I would like to meet him ashore for a couple beers. The return message was ‘Sorry cousin ... will be pulling out within three hours.’ I sure wish I could have seen him.”\n\nAfter word reached Fran of the Indianapolis’ sinking, he wrote a somber missive dated Aug. 16, 1945:\n\n“I just heard the official word on the tragic end of the Indianapolis, Frank Lucca’s cruiser. Has Uncle John heard any word yet? I guess there are only a couple-hundred survivors out of about 1,200. They say the ship blew up in a million pieces and sank within 15 minutes, so he had one chance in a million to survive. I pray that he is safe.”\n\nFrank Lucca’s son, also named Frank, provided the details of how his father beat the odds.\n\n“He’d been working in the engine room, and when he went up to his bunk to go to bed, it was too hot and he decided to sleep topside. He brought up a blanket and laid underneath one of the big guns. He was there only a few minutes when they were hit. He was on the high side of the ship when the order to ‘abandoned ship’ was given. He had to jump about 90 feet into the water. He was wearing a life belt and floated around on his own for two days until he met up with a group of guys that had a raft.\n\n“The injured were on the raft and the rest were in the water hanging onto it. He told me they would cup their hands and hit the water when the sharks came to scare them away. The real danger wasn’t sharks but drinking the saltwater. He told me he forced himself not to give in and drink it. He was a tough guy.\n\nWhen he was rescued, he had sores on his body from being in the saltwater. He had trouble with his toenails his whole life from the saltwater because he wasn’t wearing shoes when he jumped.\n\n“You know, I think about what my father experienced at 19 and what I experienced at 19. I was in college drinking beer and chasing women,” he said. “It was pretty wild what he went through.”\n\nAn obituary in The Buffalo News filled in additional details of Frank Lucca’s time in the water:\n\n“Lucca was one of the sailors cited for his compassion for fellow crewmen. Members of the crew took turns resting on debris and lifeboats in the water. But Lucca, who was not injured in the attack, stayed in the water, giving up his turns to the injured or just plain worn-out fellow crewmen,” the obituary stated.\n\nFather Conway\n\nConway was an assistant pastor at St. Brigid’s Catholic Church in South Buffalo when the war began. He repeatedly asked Bishop John A. Duffy for permission to join the Navy as a chaplain. Duffy was inundated with requests from other priests wanting to do the same, but he relented when Conway pointed out that he had made his request long before other priests.\n\nConway’s days of sailing on Lake Erie in his little boat were over.\n\nIn Thomas Helms’s book “Ordeal by Sea,” Conway’s ordeal in the aftermath of the sinking is recorded.\n\n“Father Thomas Conway ... burned himself out keeping up a constant patrol among the men, ministering to the dying, talking reason into others who had become momentarily deranged and calming the frightened with prayers until all at once he reached the limit of his endurance and his life drained away.”\n\nA crewmate held Conway’s head above the water and cried out, “He’s dead because of us. He used up his life helping us. He prayed for everybody, not for himself but for me and you and you.”\n\nOnly after a prayer was said did the shipmate let go of the chaplain.\n\n“When the prayer was finished, the young sailor slowly and gently r"
