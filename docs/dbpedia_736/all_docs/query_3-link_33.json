        "text": "Veterans Day, in the US, is being substituted today though it’s actually observed on November 11th. We honor the veterans of the armed forces and those killed in the country's wars. The observance originated in 1919 on the first anniversary of the 1918 armistice that ended World War I and was known as Armistice Day. * 1. Veterans Day was initially called Armistice Day. * 2. There’s no apostrophe in Veterans Day, implying the occasion doesn’t belong to veterans. Rather, it’s a day that honors all soldiers who once served their country, both dead and alive. * 3. Veterans Day is different from Memorial Day. In that Memorial Day explicitly honors military members who’ve lost their lives while serving. * 4. Several other commonwealth countries, including Canada and Australia, also honor soldiers who lost their lives in wars. However, in these countries, the occasion is called Remembrance Day instead of Veterans Day. * 5. Veterans Day was briefly celebrated in October. In 1968, the Uniform Holidays Bill was passed, which moved Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. The law went into effect in 1971, but in 1975, President Gerald Ford returned Veterans Day to November 11 due to the important historical significance of the date.\n\n\"Looking Back with a Chuckle: The Waistline Chronicles of a Veteran\" As we celebrate another glorious year, I couldn't help but take a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Stumbling upon two photos, 35 years apart, I was struck by a humorous realization. One photo captured my youthful self, freshly commissioned, beaming with pride in my unit. The other, a recent snapshot, where I had the while leaving the army after three decades. Despite the decades that separated these two moments, there was a remarkable constant, other than our proud regimental crest - OUR WAISTLINES! Ah, the military academy! A place where they take raw, enthusiastic youths and sculpt them into lean, mean, fighting machines. It seems the Army has a timeless tradition, immune to generational changes, ensuring that each one of us passes out with a waistline that's enviably slender. But here's the chuckle-worthy twist - maintaining that academy waistline through the years? That's a battle in itself! As veterans, we might fondly remember our youthful physiques, but let's face it, life (and perhaps a few extra helpings at the mess) adds a few inches to that once-slim silhouette. So, here's to the unchanging traditions of the military and the ever-changing waistlines of its veterans. We might not all have the same waistline we did at 20, but we share the same spirit, dedication, and pride. #MilitaryHumor #TimelessTraditions #LeanMeanAt20 #VeteranTales #WaistlineWars 🪖\n\nMemorial Day vs. Veterans Day: Understanding the Differences Memorial Day and Veterans Day are two important U.S. holidays that honor military personnel, but they serve different purposes and are observed in distinct ways. Memorial Day: Date: Last Monday in May Purpose: Honors and remembers the men and women who have died in military service to the United States. Observance: Often marked by somber ceremonies, laying of wreaths, and placing flowers on graves. Many people visit cemeteries and memorials to pay their respects to fallen soldiers. It’s a time for reflection and remembrance. Veterans Day: Date: November 11 Purpose: Celebrates and honors all military veterans, both living and deceased, who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Observance: Celebrated with parades, ceremonies, and events that thank veterans for their service. Many schools and organizations host programs to recognize the contributions of veterans. While both days honor military service members, Memorial Day is specifically dedicated to those who lost their lives in service, whereas Veterans Day honors all who have served. As Americans, we often celebrate Memorial Day as an extended weekend, please take a moment to honor the fallen members of the U.S. Armed Forces while you enjoy time with your families. Have a blessed weekend!\n\nToday is launch day for Army 250. This is a citizen-led project I started to encourage communities, institutions, and individual Americans to engage with the story of the U.S. Army as we approach its 250th birthday in 2025. Every week we'll be sharing a newsletter that lifts up different dimensions in how the Army has influenced American life and society. This will include military campaigns and stories of American soldiers throughout our history, but it will also look at the connections between the Army and facets of American life seemingly far removed from the battlefield: food, fashion, music, literature, religion, business, civil society, and so many other domains have Army stories. This makes the Army's story relevant and personal for all Americans, irrespective of one's direct connection to the service. You can access the newsletter here: https://lnkd.in/eTG56_xG This effort is intended to complement and support the incredible initiatives underway led by the US Army, the National Museum of the US Army, the Association of the United States Army - AUSA, and the US Army Center of Military History, among other institutions. Please share with anyone you think would be interested in this, and if you'd like to contribute to this project, please send me a message! #army250 #us250 #army #veterans #\n\nAs everyone enjoys this long weekend, I thought it was a good time to highlight the differences between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. While both are public holidays in the United States that honor members of the military, there are key differences between the two. 🇺🇸 What Memorial Day and Veterans Day honor Memorial Day honors military personnel who died in service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or because of wounds sustained in battle. Veterans Day honors everyone who has served in the military, whether or not they served in wartime or died in battle. 🇺🇸🇺🇸How Memorial Day and Veterans Day are observed Memorial Day: Did you know that a national moment of remembrance takes place at 3 p.m. local time? Veterans Day: While we should always thank members of the military for their service, Veterans Day is the day we come together to thank living veterans for their service and remember all who have served. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Origin of Memorial Day and Veterans Day Memorial Day was first celebrated a year after the end of the Civil War, which claimed more lives than any other conflict in U.S. history and required the establishment of the nation’s first national cemeteries. Until 1971, the holiday was known as “Decoration Day” in reference to the decoration of graves. Veterans Day was first celebrated on Nov. 11, 1919, to commemorate the end of World War I. Hostilities formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. Until 1954, Veterans Day was known as Armistice Day. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Is Memorial Day only for fallen soldiers? Memorial Day is dedicated only to those who died in battle or after injuries sustained in battle, rather than active-duty soldiers or living veterans. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Dates of Observation Memorial Day is the last Monday of May. Veterans Day is November 11 of each year. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Don’t forget Armed Forces Day. Another holiday honoring members of the military is Armed Forces Day, which honors those currently serving in the U.S. military. It is observed after May Day, which is May 1. Enjoy the holiday and please take a moment to remember those who have fallen and given so much to our liberties. 🇺🇸 #memorialday #america\n\nAs everyone enjoys this long weekend, we thought it was a good time to highlight the differences between Memorial Day and Veterans Day.

Many service members carry invisible scars that often go untreated due to the stigma surrounding mental health. But it's not just service members who face these challenges. The past few years has been tough on everyone, and it's important to recognize that the pandemic has caused similar stressors for many. Unfortunately, even medical professionals who have been working tirelessly lack the necessary training and support to deal with the mental health fallout. Let's take a step forward and be mindful of those around us. Together, we can create a more supportive and understanding community. #mentalhealthawareness #supporteachother\n\nToday we honor the brave men and women who have served our nation with unwavering dedication. Their selflessness and sacrifice have safeguarded our freedoms and inspired us all. Thank you for your service!
