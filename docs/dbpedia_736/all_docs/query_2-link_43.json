TESTIMONY OF INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ---------- AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS WITNESS BEN FOLDS, AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS Ms. McCollum [presiding]. Good morning. Welcome to the first day of two public witness hearing being held here for non-tribal government programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior, Environment Appropriations Subcommittee. And I am pleased to be joined by the former chair of this committee, still a great member, Congressman Michael Simpson of Idaho, as well as our vice chair, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree of Maine. Now, you might have noticed there was a little commotion before I put down the gavel. We were out in the hall really quick. So I would like you all to give a warm welcome to a visiting delegation of the Parliament of Georgia. We appreciate your interest in our legislative process, and we hope you find our hearing instructive because it is very important to this committee that we support our public lands, our arts, and things that make America so very special. Yes, please. [Applause.] Everybody was being so, so quiet and so polite. I didn't want to put anybody on the spot, but thank you for welcoming our guests. Last year when I became chair of this subcommittee, I brought back the important tradition of public witness days for non-tribal programs, and I am pleased today that for this hearing, more than 40 witnesses composed of a diverse range of partners, including public nonprofit organizations, State and local governments, will have an opportunity to testify before this subcommittee. Today we will hear about numerous topics related to the jurisdiction of this subcommittee, including the arts and the humanities, environment, public lands, and wildlife. I am eager to learn more about each of your priorities, and I look forward to our discussions that we have on these issues because I believe it will help all of us on this committee be more informed while we begin to develop the 2021 appropriations bill. Before I turn to Mr. Simpson, I would like to cover a few hearing logistics, however. We will call each panel of witnesses to the table one at a time, and, as you can see, our first panel, gold stars, right here. Each witness will have 5 minutes to present their testimony, and we will be using a time tracker to track the time. As I pointed out, we have 40 witnesses, so we want to be respectful of everybody's time. So when the light turns yellow, you have 1 minute remaining, and we would like you to please conclude your remarks. When the light blinks red, I will lightly gavel. [Laughter.] It is a light gavel. It is not a heavy one, and ask you to please conclude your remarks so the next witness can begin. Now, each witness needs to know we have their written statements, and I have been reading through them, so everything will be in the record. So don't feel pressure or rushed to get everything covered orally in your 5 minutes. After we hear the testimony of each witness on the panel, members will have an opportunity to ask questions, so get ready. We ask really good questions. And I would like to remind those who are joining us in the hearing room that the committee rules prohibit the use of cameras and audio equipment during the hearing by individuals without House-issued press credentials. After this morning's hearing concludes, we will adjourn and reconvene at 1:00 this afternoon for the hearing. So at this time, I am honored and very happy to yield to my dear friend, my dear friend, Mr. Simpson from Idaho. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for calling this important hearing to get input from the public on a wide array of programs under this subcommittee's jurisdiction. Mr. Joyce and I, along with other members of the subcommittee, look forward to working with you in the days and weeks ahead to do what we can to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and to make the difficult, but necessary, choices among competing priorities. Like the chair, I would like to take a minute to extend a warm welcome to all of our witnesses and to the delegation from the Parliament of Georgia, who are sitting in the audience. Since we have a full day ahead of us, I am happy to yield back, and I look forward to the testimony. Ms. McCollum. Thank you. There will be a portion of the testimony where I will have to step out and attend another hearing, but the vice chair, who has many other arts titles here at the U.S. Congress, will be ably ready to assist in taking remaining testimony. So with that, we have our first panel: Mr. Ben Folds, Ms. Pam Breaux, Ms. Beth Kane, and Stephanie---- Ms. Eriacho. Eriacho. Ms. McCollum [continuing]. Eriacho. Beautiful name. In the interest of time, I am just going to let you introduce your arts organizations so we have more time for questions. Mr. Folds? Mr. Folds. Chair McCollum, Ranking Member Joyce, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of Americans for the Arts and the NEA, something that is very important to me. I was here speaking to your committee 1 year ago, and I wish more people could see this side of D.C. It is really nice to see you all working together on something that is important to everybody, and it gave me some fuel to go back out and do it again for 1 year, something that I do as advocacy for arts. I have submitted written testimony for the record that presents arguments we know are effective in making the case for the National Endowment for the Arts. I state that I am asking for at least $170 million for the National Endowment for the Arts for the 2021 Fiscal Year. You all know this, but it is worth noting for the public watching that this request just brings us to the 1994 levels of investment for the NEA. That is not a big ask for something that is very important. I began my career as a rock and roll recording artist 30 years ago, making albums and touring every corner of the U.S. It is kind of like I am on constant campaigning. I just talk to people. I am everywhere and talk to everybody. For the past 15 years, a big part of my career has been performing with symphony orchestras in cities big and small. I just got back from performing two nights with the Minnesota Symphony. I performed with the Utah symphony in Salt Lake in April. I do that regularly. Tacoma Symphony Orchestra in November. I have done them all. One of my greatest experiences was Cleveland's Contemporary Youth Orchestra, and that is a total NEA success story. That is wonderful. It is 100 kids, all walks of life, and they are fantastic. They play all original music. I did five seasons of primetime NBC music television. I am about to embark on a TV series for Fred Rogers Productions composing songs with children. I am the artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center where my mission is to bring younger audiences to experience the symphony, an important part of our culture. It means a lot to me. At my own gigs, I tell each audience that the symphony orchestra is the artistic symbol for civilization, which I believe is very true. You are seeing 50, 60, 100 people on stage working together. The rhetoric that we use every day--in concert, in harmony. Those are all symbols of the symphony orchestra, and the symbols matters to me. That is what we take with our flag. I am a cold-hearted capitalist you should know---- [Laughter.] Mr. Folds [continuing]. Who is grateful for the competitive environment in which I succeeded because it pushed me creatively, and it pushed me personally. So I come to you as an artist, an arts advocate, but also a small business owner because in rock music, the band runs out of gas and you are done. Zero-zero. A small business owner knows the difference between spending and investing. If you spend too much you fail. The NEA is to me, is a great investment. It is felt most profoundly in rural areas where an NEA dollar results in $9 in matching funds from the private sector. That is the kind of investment that satisfies the cold-hearted capitalist in myself. But the invaluable, irreplaceable service that the NEA offers most has to do with access to the arts. That is the important part to me is the access and the access for everyone. It is hard to do it any other way. It is not as much about supporting the arts, which is important, but it is about finding ways for the arts to support and help us. It is putting the arts to work, and you see that every day if you tour as much as I do. For profound examples of this, I don't have to draw from my professional career. I live in a small Hudson Valley River town. It is as small as a postage stamp. It is just a few blocks wide and deep. We have a very diverse population that you will ever see. It seems like a Kentucky rural countryside. It is sitting right next to Brooklyn. It is all together. But sadly, despite the proximity, there is not a lot of mingling. Different blocks, different stores, different churches despite all our best intentions. Just last December, I attended a fun little concert. It involved children, and it involved local professional performers, musicians, and dances. It was just so cool. I don't normally like stuff like this, but it was awesome. Kids from all the neighborhoods got together, sung together. The parents mingled. Everyone had a good time, and it is the first time I saw everyone together. I looked at the program, ``Made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts,'' and they nailed it. They nail it all the time. And the people in the community made it work all the way to whatever level this has to come down from. We have a lot of arts, a lot of arts money in the Hudson, but I have never seen it bring people together like that. I think I am out of time, so I am just going to say that $170 million is not 50 cents a year per person. It is not quite 50 cents. Over my lifetime, I have seen it increase at $1 per capita. Thanks for your time. [The statement of Mr. Folds follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Wonderful. Please. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF STATE ARTS AGENCIES WITNESS PAMELA (PAM) BREAUX, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF STATE ARTS AGENCIES Ms. Breaux. Good morning. Ms. McCollum. Good morning. Ms. Breaux. Chairwoman McCollum, Ranking Member Joyce, and members of the committee, today, Members Pingree and Simpson, thank you for your invitation to deliver this testimony today regarding Federal appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts. My name is Pam Breaux, and I serve as president and CEO of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, or NASAA, the organization that represents and serves the Nation's 56 State and jurisdictional arts agencies. And today I am here to thank the committee, to thank the members for their tremendous support of the Arts Endowment, and urge the committee to consider funding it at $170 million in Fiscal Year 2021. In the recent funding bill passed by Congress, this subcommittee supported an increase in funding for the Agency. The States and NASAA are extremely grateful for this. We recognize that committee members worked together in a bipartisan manner to support the Endowment and its important contributions to our country. Through its highly-effective Federal/State partnership, the Endowment contributes 40 percent of its programmatic funds to State, jurisdictional, and regional arts agencies each year. That resulting $49 million Fiscal Year 2019 helped to empower States and regions to address their priorities. Unique among Federal agencies, the Endowment funds State plans. These plans are developed by State arts agencies in response to citizens, communities, arts organizations, legislators, and governors. That makes the Federal/State arts investment incredibly responsive and relevant to citizens. The report accompanying the last appropriations act affirmed Congress' support for this important partnership and its corresponding 40 percent allocation, and we thank the committee for this acknowledgement. State arts agencies use their share of Endowment funds combined with funds from State legislators to support about 22,000 grants to arts and civic organizations and schools in more than 4,500 communities. Twenty-two percent of the grant awards go to non-metropolitan areas, supporting programs that benefit rural America, and 26 percent of State grant dollars go to arts education, fostering student success in and out of school. Congress' continued support of the 40 percent formula is essential to State arts agencies, boosting their ability to ensure that the arts benefit all communities regardless of wealth or geography. In response to an increased demand for arts programming for older Americans, for example, the Minnesota State Arts Board recently provided training for teaching artists to learn how to design and implement high-quality arts education programs specifically for older adults. With the total number of older adults in in Minnesota expected to double between 2010 and 2030, creative aging programming is a key strategy for fostering positive aging and healthier lives. And the State Arts Board Programs will ensure that Minnesota artists are trained to provide these vital services. In an additional example, the Ohio Arts Council demonstrates its commitment to all the people of the State by successfully fulfilling its Fund Every County Initiative. Now all 88 counties in the State have received arts funding in response to their needs. Should Congress support an increase for the Arts Endowment, State arts agencies will be in a position to expand their meaningful work to help communities thrive as fulfilling and productive places to live, conduct business, visit, and raise families. NASAA and state arts agencies also applaud the Arts Endowment's many services to the country, including its leadership in developing noteworthy programs for communities, military personnel, veterans, students, and so many others. We proudly partner with the Endowment and work collaboratively with them to benefit all communities across the country because together we can accomplish what neither side can achieve alone. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. We look forward at NASAA to continuing to work productively with this committee, and we stand ready to serve as a resource to you. Thanks. [The statement of Ms. Breaux follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, February 6, 2020. NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES AND THE STATE HUMANITIES COUNCILS WITNESS BETH KANE, GRANTEE, NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES AND THE STATE HUMANITIES COUNCILS Ms. Kane. Madam Chair and member of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to present testimony on behalf of the State Humanities Councils, the state affiliates of the National Endowment for the Humanities. My name is Beth Kane, and I am director of the Norway Memorial Library in Norway, Maine. My institution has received no fewer than 24 grants from the Maine Humanities Council. I am here to request $170 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities for Fiscal Year 2021, and $54 million for the Federal/State Partnership, which provides allocations by formula to the 56 humanities councils. Because this request is so important, I would like to tell you what the State Humanities Council support has done for Norway and other rural communities across our country. Norway, Maine is a town of about 5,000 people in southern Oxford County between Little Androscoggin River and the western foothills of the Mahoosuc Range of the White Mountains. The Norway Memorial Library has a staff of six and serves over 40,000 visitors a year. Our most recent annual report records program attendance of 6,301. As in so many towns across rural America, the library in Norway is an anchor cultural and educational institution and plays a central role in the life of the community. The Maine Humanities Council has been our valued partner for more than 30 years. Through grant funding and program partnerships, the Council has helped to shape how we understand our work and clarify our vision for the kinds of intellectual and cultural opportunities we offer. In partnership with the Maine Humanities Council, the library has been home to popular book discussion programs for the general public and for low literacy adults, who may have never dreamed they would be part of a book group. Other offerings include lectures, theatrical presentations, and community discussions programs. To give just one example, in 2013, the library was awarded a Bridging Cultures Muslim Journeys Bookshelf by the American Library Association and the NEH. We turn to the Maine Humanities Council for financial support for cultural programming, including speakers, musicians, a film screening, and scholars to help lead book discussions. This year, several Norway organizations will come together to plan events for the State's bicentennial. The library and Norway Historical Society will seek Council support for programs as part of this series. Time and again we have seen hunger for this kind of programming, and it is no small thing when a discussion series on race and justice in America brings in 89 people over five discussions, or 52 people attend a talk by an Iranian immigrant sharing his family's story of building a life in Maine. These experiences have lasting impact on the life of the community. Maine Humanities Council programs and grants enable people in my town to access cultural and lifelong learning opportunities that the library simply could not provide on its own. The work of our State Humanities Council levels the playing field so that my small-town library can offer experiences equal and intellectual depths and breadth to those found in America's biggest cities. I am very proud that the Norway Memorial Library is a valuable resource for the people of my community, but I am not here today because my library is special. I am here because libraries serving communities like mine are partnering with their state humanities councils in every corner of America. What I have described in Norway is a microcosm of the impact State humanities council support has had on individuals and neighbors across our country. The councils make humanities programs possible in places where a small grant of several hundred to a few thousand dollars can make an enormous difference. The councils, along with the NEH, are now looking ahead to the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, an event that offers Americans the opportunity to renew our understanding of our founding principles, explore how they have been both challenged and reinforced, give voice to marginalized stories in communities, and deepen understanding of our collective history and the pillars of democracy. The State humanities councils can help make the next 5 years a time when we rededicate ourselves to strengthening civics education and reinvigorating our ability to work through differences. My written testimony describes a wide range of programs made possible by State humanities councils in communities large and small, in every corner of this Nation where residents are talking with each other about issues that matter. The State councils are well positioned to effectively put to use the $54 million we are requesting through Federal/State partnerships. Thank you for this opportunity you have given me to testify, for the support you have provided over the years, and for the important work of the State humanities councils and the National Endowment for the Humanities. [The statement of Ms. Kane follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Thank you. This panel, and I know we have another speaker, but I set it up going in this direction. So we have heard from the Assembly of State Arts Agencies. We have heard from Americans from the Arts, and we have heard from the Endowment for the Humanities. And now we are going to hear from a very, very special American, one who not only shared her story, but her uncle's story, and how the arts and the humanities make it possible for us to say thank you for your service. Please introduce yourself for the record. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. JEFFERSON COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITNESS STEPHANIE ERIACHO, STUDENT VETERAN, JEFFERSON COMMUNITY COLLEGE Ms. Eriacho. My name is Stephanie Eriacho, and I am a student at Jefferson Community College in Watertown, New York. Good morning. Thank you to the subcommittee for inviting me today to testify today. I am pleased to testify in support of the National Endowment for Humanities on behalf of the National Humanities Alliance. As I said, I am a student at Jefferson Community College, home to Fort Drum. I am a retired Navy veteran and aircraft mechanic by trade. I deployed 12 times, including a 7-month deployment to Iraq, and a 13-month deployment to Afghanistan. In 2018, the College offered a class for combat veterans called Dialogues of Honor and Sacrifice. The class made possible by a National Endowment for the Humanities grant was intended to teach the history, literature, and art of the Civil, Vietnam, and Iraq Wars. I was drawn to this course because I wanted to better understand my uncle's experience. He is an Army veteran who had been twice during the Vietnam War, and was awarded two Purple Hearts. I remember my uncle as being intimidating, quiet, and a scary man who wanted nothing to do with me. We hadn't spoken more than two full sentences to one another by the time I left to join the Navy in 1996. Nonetheless, I visited my uncle every chance I could during my time in the Navy, but nothing was as special as the visits after I experienced real combat deployments. Now, seeing me as a fellow combat veteran, he let down his guard. He smiled, laughed, and even joked around. My uncle was now able to talk, even just a little bit, about his experience in Vietnam. Knowing I could relate, he let me see his guilt and pain that he had been harboring for years: guilty for wanting to be proud of wearing his Army uniform even being spat on when he stepped off the plane; guilty for being able to come back home to his family unlike so many brothers who lost their lives in front of him. It was not until another tour in Afghanistan that I grew more like my uncle. When I returned, I began to self-medicate with alcohol, or I was working out 6 times a week for about 2 hours a day to the point of exhaustion. My relationship with my husband, my children, and my family were severely strained. My children, especially my oldest, were afraid when I got angry. I could not wrap my head around why I felt lost, alone, and misunderstood. It was in the midst of these challenges that I had the opportunity to take the Dialogues of Honor and Sacrifice course, and while I hoped the focus on the Vietnam War would help me understand more about my uncle, I didn't realize how it would affect me. How it would help me as well. The course began 2 weeks before JCC's 2018 fall semester with a week-long trip that took both professors and students to Gettysburg, Arlington National Cemetery, and Washington, D.C. We learned the history of the sites and bonded quickly. Although we were strangers, we were interested in one another, taking turns, talking and listening. Sometimes no words needed to be spoken, only the presence of a fellow combat soldier who understood. Fall semester began with the trip still fresh in our minds, and we dove straight into the history of all three wars. We studied contrasts and similarities between the three wars, but to our amazement, we realized that these soldiers were not so different from us. Experiences in Vietnam, the battle, and the firefights in Iraq were also similar. As veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, we could relate to stories from a Civil War. This camaraderie across conflicts was amazing. It was a special bond that most could never fathom. Our focus shifted to poetry, literature, music, and art as we read, Here, Bullet, a book of short poems. Our task was to create our own poem, intimidating at first, but became a touching, lasting experience, a liberating sense of freedom to open your heart and pour every brutal emotion onto paper so that readers can experience the reality. When we moved to The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien, it became everyone's favorite because every student carried something special in their combat war zone. We related to one another across different branches of military, different theaters of war, and even drastically different duties while at war. Moving towards the last 2 weeks of the week, we entered the world of art. Each student was given a blank masquerade mask to decorate it as we saw ourselves. The introspection and self- evaluation produced every raw emotion I have ever felt as they flooded onto my mask. The syllabus surely did not reflect therapy or liberation as a goal, but it helped me face my past with the realization that none of us are alone in the battle of normalcy. The curriculum allowed everyone to engage and challenge one another. They forced everyone to try different perspectives and even think differently than they normally may. During the last week of the course, we had the privilege of speaking with two Vietnam veterans. My initial drive for pursuing this program was upon me, trying to understand my uncle, hoping to learn how to bond with him. I learned horrific details from these Vietnam veterans, but ones I wanted to hear, ones I knew would help me relate to my uncle. But I also began to realize that searching for a better understanding about my uncle was not as impossible as I thought. Our lives and experience paralleled each other at each times; occasionally, even mirrored one another. My experiences were less gruesome and less drastic, but in the end, he and I carried the same demon from war. We are kept awake at night for the same reasons. Through a combination of course and therapy, my night terrors have lessened dramatically. Anxiety attacks are almost gone. I still avoid big crowds, but I have learned to work through my fears. My relationship with my family, both immediate and extended, have improved and are no longer strained. For the first time in my life, I have been at peace with myself and no longer self-medicate to drown out the noises in my head. I am so grateful for the opportunity I had to take this course and appreciate the support the subcommittee has offered NEH in recent years, making programs like this possible. To ensure that more veterans and all Americans can benefit from humanities as I did, I ask that you fund the NEH at $170 million for the Fiscal Year of 2021. Thank you for your time. [The statement of Ms. Eriacho follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Thank you, and the Mask Program is something that I have seen that we have worked with other arts organizations, Americans for the Arts. So thank you so much for your testimony. Ms. Pingree, do you have a question for the panelists? Ms. Pingree. So many, but I have a feeling you want me to keep it short. Ms. McCollum. I can tap you lightly. [Laughter.] Ms. Pingree. Okay. Well, first, Madam Chair, thank you. This is a wonderful panel. I know it is going to be a great morning of panelists, but this is really a great, as you said, sort of transition between looking at the big picture. And thank you so much for sharing your personal story. That is just really profound. I don't think any of us could say it better about how the arts can impact an individual, a family, and obviously the community. You took the course, that is really great, and I really appreciate you sharing so much with us. And to all of you, thank you. Of course, we are great fans of Americans for the Arts, and really appreciate all that they do in--in the national perspective on all of this. And for you to make this part of your career, it is really beneficial. We love the state associations for the arts, and it is important to us. And, Beth, thank you so much for coming from the State of Maine. I am honored to have you here. And, of course, if you lived in the State of Maine, there is only 1.3 million people, and we joke we are just a small town with very long roads. [Laughter.] And, of course, Beth and I hadn't seen each for a very long time, and then we realized that were closely connected by her husband. And that is just how it is in Maine. You know everyone one way or the other. And thank you for the great work. I really appreciated the fact that you brought it home to all of us that in every small rural town, there isn't sufficient funds. There aren't sufficient funds to support the kinds of works that the NEA and the NEH do. And I don't think people realize how profound that is, the number of people who would come in to hear the experience of an Iranian immigrant or to come in and talk about race, and, you know, many challenges that are faced in every single community. And you all really brought that out about how the arts can bring us all together. So I am obviously making a statement, not asking a question, but just quickly because I won't have as much time as I would like. But is there more that you could do? I mean, I hope we can fund at $170 million, and based on all your testimony, we should be doing this at $170 billion, I don't know. You know, it should be twice that, right? [Laughter.] Mr. Simpson. I don't know about all that. [Laughter.] Ms. Pingree. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, but, as you said, I think less than 50 cents a person. I think this is a contribution we would all make seeing the work that you did. But just quickly share with us, what could you do if you had a little more money, and why is it so important in a community like Norway because I am assuming you wouldn't find these funds in the communities' budget. Ms. Kane. We would not. We have great support in our community, but a lot of it is not necessarily financial support. We could always do more. We try to keep in the back pocket availability and openness to programs that come our way. We are always keeping our eyes and ears open. We can't do everything on a shoestring. We have very generous authors and professionals in Maine who come to libraries, but money always helps. What we find is the cultural aspect, discussing a book is one thing, but when you can actually bring in speakers or musicians, or take the food, or hear more in depth, it grows and expands that experience for everyone in the community. That frequently takes money that we don't necessarily have. Ms. Pingree. Well, thank you. I would love to ask you all a question, but I know I will get in trouble. But thank you so much. You really gave great testimony this morning. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. McCollum. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you all for being here to testify. This is an area that I think is very important, and I think it is bipartisan between Republicans and Democrats. Several years ago I said, I guess about 4 or 5 years ago, we had one of the directors for the NEA out in Idaho. In fact, I think I have had the last four out to Idaho. Last summer we had Mary Anne Carter and toured the State for a few days and stopped at local arts councils and everything. I said, you know what we need to do is find a plan where we can project 5 years ahead where we would like to double the investment in the arts and humanities, and put that one a glide path somehow as they did in 1994 when they said they wanted to NIH funding over a 5-year period, and they did it. When you look at our total budget of stuff, $170 million is not all that much money. But they do incredible work in communities all across this country, and it has been, as I said, my pleasure to have the directors of both the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities out to the State. In fact, I had the director for the National Endowment for the Humanities bring to Boise one day when I was there about 10 or 12 people who had gotten grants, that the State had given grants to. And we sat around the table, and they each talked about what they were doing and why they were doing it, and so forth. It is fascinating stuff, but it is very important. Pam, you mentioned 40 percent of the $170 million, if you got that, goes to the States. Is that true? Is that the same in the Humanities? What is the split between State and---- Ms. Kane. I haven't done the percentage. That sounds about right. Yes, thank you. Yeah, this is my homework. Mr. Simpson. Is that the right split? Ms. Breaux. Yeah, it is about the same. They parallel. To my humanities? Yeah, they are parallel. Mr. Simpson. Is that the right split? Ms. Breaux. It is. I think it is an important split. Forty percent is meaningful and goes a long way to match State dollars for important programming, and it is also meaningful that the National Endowment for the Arts retains 60 percent of its funding at the national level because it allows arts organizations across the country to compete in a national pool. And those who are able to do that find incredible leverage within that to go out and raise other resources for programming. Mr. Simpson. And I think it is probably true for most of us is that, you know, I am not worried about the arts in New York, or the arts in Washington, or the arts in Los Angeles. I am worried about the arts in Salmon, Idaho. Ms. Breaux. Right. Mr. Simpson. And how do we make sure that we can continue to support the arts communities in rural America---- Ms. Breaux. Right. Mr. Simpson [continuing]. That don't have access to a lot of these things? So it has been fantastic what they have been doing. I hope they continue it. I have always questioned whether 60/40 was the right split or whatever, and I don't know what it is, but I know that my wife is on the Idaho Falls Arts Council, and there is one person they do have to satisfy in this world. [Laughter.] And so I do whatever I can. Ms. Breaux. One additional note on the importance of the investment on the Federal side, on the 60 percent side, is it allows both the Endowments, I think, to invest in new work that then can have a major ripple effect. And a prime example of that would be both Endowments' investments in arts and humanities and military, right? Mr. Simpson. Yeah. Ms. Breaux. It is both the Endowments that began those pilots that have led to so much important work now going on across the country in arts and humanities to benefit members of the military. And that had to be tested and created someplace, and it is the leadership shown at both Endowments that enable that to happen. So that is another important part of a strong investment on the Federal side, that leadership and what they-- -- Mr. Simpson. You talked about the authors, and the Idaho Humanities Council brings out authors and does a lecture in north Idaho and southeast Idaho, and southwestern Idaho, and they have been fascinating. And ever since I started going to those when I can, when I get out of here and go to them, it has cost me a lot of money. Then I support the humanities, and last year, we had Douglas Brinkley that wrote ``Moonshot,'' and listening to him talk about it all is just fantastic. So anyway, Stephanie, thank you for your testimony. We appreciate it very much. Ms. McCollum. As I mentioned, I have another committee that I am going to be going to later, and it is the one that oversees the defense money. And we are having the Department of Defense, now that the humanities and the arts have proven ways in which to help our service men and women heal, recover, be resilient, be strong, they are stepping up to the plate in order to free up more dollars for more opportunities to work with our communities at large. And when you help a veteran, you help their family, and I say that as a daughter of a veteran, so. But, Mr. Folds, I want to know, when you mentioned working on this project with the Rogers Foundation, with kids, my kids had an artist in residence, and the ``Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich'' song has not left my head since you mentioned that. [Laughter.] So will you help me think about something else today and just kind of tell me where you are going to go? What are some of the goals and aspirations, because I think it is really important to get into schools and for kids to understand music is language, music is math. Mr. Folds. Exactly, yeah. Ms. McCollum. Music is transformative. Mr. Folds. Yeah. I mean, the angle of the show that I am doing with the Rogers Foundation is music as communication first and foremost. I mean, the human brain works that way. You know, if a little kid says, I want to go home, it is like, okay, we have got to a song. You do that 3 times. [Laughter.] Mr. Simpson. We begin to think that doing is an art is great. It is hijacking something that we already do in communication, and if you can teach a kid that and not intimidate them too badly at the beginning about are you going to be a musician, are you going to be proficient at it or not. When you learn art as, you know, painting, the first thing you do when you are a little kid is you do something that is an original piece that came out of you. When you do music, not so much. You know, you are usually learning dead German music, you know? And I think it is really important to do both, but this show is an attempt to, and it has been really successful so far in the pilots that we have done. The kids have all kinds of ideas. Behind we will have a student group of musicians that are a little bit older so they can see that you could get good. Ms. McCollum. Yeah. Mr. Folds. Plus I give them the riff. So if the kid has said, I want to go home, I am like, okay, harp plays this, you play this, and now say what you just said. And they say it, and they sing it, and they come up with new ideas. So I think it is good because it is not for kids who are going to grow and be musicians. It is for kids to grow up and have an idea of how to speak publicly, how to organize their lives, how to connect abstract and critical thinking together. And I am inspired by it. Ms. McCollum. Well, I want to thank the first panel for setting the table literally up here for what we are going to hear the rest of the morning and this afternoon. Thank you very much. Thank you, Stephanie. Ms. Eriacho. Thank you. Ms. McCollum. It is always a good sign when people are still talking after a panel has left, but I want to be respectful of everyone's time. So I am going to, because we are already a little behind, we are not going to introduce everybody twice. I am just going to let you folks take it. You sat in order, and introduce yourself and your organization because we want to have time for questions. So, please. Ms. Onley. Is it on? Ms. McCollum. The little red light is on. Ms. Onley. Okay. Thursday, February 6, 2020. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WITNESS KAMERAN ONLEY, DIRECTOR OF U.S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY Ms. Onley. Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. It is hard to follow that last panel. That was pretty moving and very exhilarating. On a personal note, I will start with I am Kameran Onley. I am the director for U.S. policy and government relations at the Nature Conservancy. And on a personal note, as I was sitting there listening to your last panelist, I was thinking of my daughter who is 12, and she is literally going through a test right now on the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence. And it has just been so fun for me to tell her that I am coming up here to talk to you, really exercising democracy. I wish she could be with me here today, but she is taking a science test also. [Laughter.] But just thank you. It is really timely for me. So Chairwoman McCollum, Congressman Simpson, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit our recommendations, the Nature Conservancy's recommendations, for Fiscal Year 2021. The Nature Conservancy is an international organization. We are in all 50 States, but also around the world, working to protect ecologically important lands, waters for people and nature. Building on the themes that you heard from our last panel, you know, the nature really unites people. We see that across the country. It brings people together to work on issues they care deeply about in their community. It also heals people. We have seen more and more science where we have seen veterans use our rivers, use our parks, use our nature to really heal after some very traumatic events. We would like to thank you all on the committee for the work that we do over the years with policy initiatives on the ground. Chairwoman McCollum, you have been just a champion for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We cannot thank you enough for that, increasing the funding for the conservation not just for your home State, but for projects around the country, nationwide. I also wanted to recognize Ranking Member Joyce has continued support for the Great Lakes Initiative. It has been great. Each one of you have done work with us, the Nature Conservancy, in your home States, but also nationwide. We cannot thank you enough. We have a lot of it in our submitted testimonies. I can't highlight it all, so I apologize for that. We have to be brief. Those are just two examples of where we have worked with you. As we enter the Fiscal Year 2021 budget cycle and likely another challenging fiscal environment, the Conservancy wishes to thank all of you for the 2020 programs and the support there. Our budget recommendations that we submitted to you in full reflect a balanced approach from the funding levels that we have seen in prior years. The Fiscal Year 2020 spending package dedicated $495 million dollars to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Thank you. This is a fund that has seen strong bipartisan support, again, bringing people together, and the Conservancy appreciates Congress' commitment to the funding of important projects on the ground and the recreational project that that program delivers across the country. The Conservancy this year is supporting $900 million full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We are looking forward to that, but also looking forward to working with all of you to see a permanent funding fix for that program. We strongly support funding for habitat and wildlife conservation investments, like the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund and the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants Program. These and other investments are essential to ensuring that we take strategic actions to prevent species from being listed as threatened or endangered. Notably, the Conservancy requests continued investment in ongoing efforts to restore and conserve sagebrush habitat and the greater sage-grouse across Federal, State, tribal, and private lands. These resources are needed to implement on-the-ground projects and monitor habitat treatments, address fire, invasive grasses, and facilitate the partnerships and the science needed that for effective conservation. We also urge the subcommittee to continue its support for programs that focus on specific geographic areas. I mentioned the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, but the EPA's programs and the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, Long Island Sound, Gulf of Mexico programs, all of those contribute to protecting habitat, water quality on a large landscape scale. These programs have a proven record of supporting the States' voluntary restoration efforts, and the Conservancy urges the committee to continue to support strong Fiscal Year 2020 funding for these programs. I will close by thanking all of you for the continued work to address wildfire funding. Congress took major steps to stabilize the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service as well as the Department of Interior's budgets with the 2018 fire fix. However, the fire fix will only be fully successful without substantial reinvestment and the programs that help those forests be resilient. Strategic, proactive hazardous fuel and restoration treatments have proven to be safe and cost effective in reducing risks, and leaving forests a more natural condition resilient to those wildfires. Again, thank you for the opportunity to be here and to submit the Nature Conservancy's recommendations for Fiscal Year 2021.

AMERICAN HIKING SOCIETY WITNESS KATHRYN VAN WAES, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN HIKING SOCIETY Ms. Van Waes. Thank you. I am Kate Van Waes, executive director of American Hiking Society. Chair McCollum and members of the subcommittee, on behalf of American Hiking Society and the Trails Move People Coalition, I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide testimony today on the vital importance of adequately funding our Nation's trails and public lands to ensure access for all. This is about more than preserving precious ecological and cultural treasures. Children's outside playtime is shrinking, and the gap between the diversity of our Nation and the diversity of those spending time outdoors is widening, resulting in measurable detriment to mental and physical health and development. We cannot afford to push trail funding to the sidelines. American Hiking Society is the only national nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering all, and I stress all, to enjoy, share, and preserve the hiking experience. We envision a world where everyone feels welcome in the hiking community and has permanent access to meaningful hiking. Our efforts ensure funding for hiking trails, the preservation of natural areas, and expansion of access to and inclusion in outdoor recreation. American Hiking Society has mobilized over 558,000 trail volunteers to construct and maintain 41,000 miles of trails on Federal and State public lands at a value of over $108 million in labor. I am also testifying today on behalf of the newly-formed Trails Move People Coalition. The member organizations of the Coalition represent millions of Americans who spend their time, money, and energy to get out on trails for recreation and volunteer activities. I thank the subcommittee for in recent years leading congressional efforts to provide incremental increases in funding that benefit trails and the hiking community, and I encourage continued progress, and know I am speaking to friends today. I will highlight a few of these funding priorities today with the full list of recommendations provided in my written statement. We are grateful to the subcommittee for providing increased funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in Fiscal Year 2020. Like the Nature Conservancy, we are urging full funding at $900 million. The LWCF protects and makes accessible much of our Nation's trails, public lands, parks, and open spaces. One great example is the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program. This innovative program has made real progress in expanding access to outdoor spaces for urban communities, especially urban communities of color, whose access to and inclusion in outdoor recreation have been disproportionately negatively impacted by geography, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Along with full LWCF funding, passage of the Outdoors for All Act will help programs, like Outdoor Recreation Legacy, thrive. Hiking, simply walking along a trail, be it urban or wild, poses the fewest participation barriers of almost any outdoor activity. But it requires trails, paved and unpaved, and trails don't build and maintain themselves. That requires human labor and Federal funding. Specifically, for the Forest Service, which is responsible for over 80 percent of all federally- managed trails in the U.S., we recommend funding the capital improvement and maintenance trails budget at $100 million, which will allow the completion of annual maintenance needs and begin addressing the huge trail maintenance backlog. For the Bureau of Land Management, we urge the creation of a trail specific line item in their budget. The BLM manages over 13,000 miles of trails, traversing a rich diversity of landscapes for hikers, anglers, hunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Unlike other Federal land managers, though, BLM does not have an individual funding line item for trails, resulting in inconsistent funding levels and a lack of clarity on allocations. For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, we recommend funding for refuge visitor services at just over $74 million. National wildlife refuges provide incredible opportunities for outdoor recreation on 11 national scenic and historic trails and 44 national recreation trails, supporting more than 37,000 jobs. In conclusion, the nearly 1 million square miles that comprise U.S. public lands are our most treasured natural, historic, and cultural resource. Whether you are a hiker enjoying the abundance of American trails, which span over 4 times the total length of interstate highways, whether you are a member of the indigenous populations for whom these lands are their ancestral homes, or one of the 145 million outdoor recreation users, our public lands are of incalculable value to hundreds of millions of Americans. As we all strive together to protect these lands and trails and make them accessible and welcoming to all communities for generations to come, Congress must do its part to ensure adequate funding. I thank the committee for holding this public witness day and providing me with the opportunity to give this testimony. [The statement of Ms. Van Waes follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, February 6, 2020. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TRAIL COALITION WITNESS AMANDA WHEELOCK, POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER, CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TRAIL COALITION Ms. Wheelock. Chair McCollum and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition, a nonprofit organization with the mission to complete, promote, and protect the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. My name is Amanda Wheelock, and I am the policy and communications manager for the Coalition. For those who haven't had the fortune of visiting the Continental Divide Trail, usually known simply as the CDT, travels 3,100 miles along the spine of the Rocky Mountains, connecting the vibrant Tonahutu of the southern New Mexican desert to the equally brilliant yellow larches of Glacier National Park in northern Montana, as well as countless natural historical and cultural treasures in between, including several hundred miles in the 2nd District of Idaho. The Continental Divide Trail Coalition and our members greatly appreciate your previous support for the CDT and the entire National Trail System through appropriations to our land management agency partners to build and maintain these trails, and respectfully request that you continue and increase the support as detailed in our written testimony. We are also grateful for your efforts to increase appropriations for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, often referred to as America's best conservation program and the subject of my testimony today. Statistics abound on the myriad successes of LWCF, but I myself prefer stories to statistics. So let's imagine ourselves on the CDT for a, moment walking just a few miles outside of Steamboat Springs, Colorado on a warm summer's day. As we walk, shimmering Aspen Groves and golden rangeland stretch beyond the horizon in front of us as does the black pavement of the highway we are walking on. An 18-wheeler whizzes by just 5 or 6 feet away, followed by a long line of cars stuck behind it, cursing and wishing they could get up to Rabbit Ears Pass even quicker than they are now. Here in northern Colorado, due to a lack of public land, the CDT is forced to follow along the shoulder of Highways 14 and 40 for almost 15 miles, tempting no one but the most determined of through-hikers to experience this particularly dangerous section of this National Scenic Trail. Despite more than 4 decades of work by dedicated Land Management agency staff, nonprofit partners, volunteers, and members of trail site communities, the Continental Divide Trail remains incomplete due to gaps just like this one in public land ownership along its corridor. Without LWCF funding, there is no realistic way to acquire the lands necessary to create a continuous corridor for the trail, leaving what should be a world-class recreational resource with no path to completion. That is why the Continental Divide Trail Coalition respectfully requests $900 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund in Fiscal Year 2021, because we believe that resources like the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail deserve the protection via LWCF that they were promised. And we are not alone in this belief. A full 98 percent of small business owners along the CDT support Congress providing dedicated full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and just last year, more than 200 of those business owners along the trail went a step further, signing open letters urging their senators and representatives to provide LWCF with full permanent funding. Residents of Steamboat Springs, which became an official CDT gateway community in 2018, want dearly to see their section of trail moved off of the highway and made footing of a National Scenic Trail. The Yampa Valley Community Foundation has provided funding to CDTC to support our work to close the gap. Big Agnes, a multimillion-dollar and much beloved gear company borne out Steamboat Springs, rallied their entire staff of more than a 120 people to relay all 750 miles of the CDT in Colorado to raise awareness of the trail and the need for its completion. And many local residents stand willing and ready to volunteer to build the new trail section. Steamboat Springs resident, Kathleen Lynch, perhaps captured their spirit best when she said, ``It is so much more than a trail to the people who live here. It feels so much a part of what defines us as a community that protecting it is inherent to what we believe in.'' The Land and Water Conservation Fund is vital to communities like Steamboat Springs all across the United States, to their economies, to their health, and to their identities. We hope to see you invest in these communities and in our public lands by fully funding LWCF in Fiscal Year 2021. Thank you for your time today and for your consideration of these important requests. [The statement of Ms. Wheelock follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, February 6, 2020. PARTNERSHIP FOR THE NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM WITNESS KATHY DECOSTER, ADVOCACY & POLICY COORDINATOR, PARTNERSHIP FOR THE NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM Ms. DeCoster. Good morning. My name is Kathy DeCoster, and thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am testifying this morning on behalf of the Partnership of the National Trail System, but I wanted to echo what Kameran and others earlier have said about our appreciation for the time you put into these public witness days. It is probably underappreciated or certainly unknown maybe outside these walls, but we are very grateful that you are listening to the American people for many days. I am just glad I am on the early panel. [Laughter.] I am testifying today for the Partnership, which represents the 30 congressionally-designated national historic and scenic trails that make up the National Trail System. I brought a couple of maps to look at while we are talking because you may know about the one or two trails that are in your district or your State, but you may not know that there is at least one national trail in each of the 50 States. Altogether, they are a significant public land resource for the American people worthy of investment. The 19 national historic trails help tell our uniquely American story from colonial exploration, to the forced relocation of Native Americans, to the civil rights struggle, and so much more. And the 11 National Scenic Trails, like Amanda just discussed, along the Continental Divide Trail, provide millions of Americans with access to the outdoors over thousands of miles close to home and in remote wilderness areas. Here are some quick statistics to keep in mind. These 30 trails connect with 84 national parks, 89 national forests, 70 national wildlife refuges, over 100 BLM public land areas, and 179 national wilderness areas. The individual national trails and their supporting groups have engaged 129 trail towns mostly in rural areas at the local level, and they run near or through 100 major urban areas. So the system is really something we are working to expand and appreciate the support you all have given. Your ongoing commitment in the past and last year's appropriations bill has made an enormous difference to this system and to the successful work of trail groups and trail administrators on the ground. It is also worth noting that in 2019, the Federal funds invested in the trails leveraged over $13 million in private funding and 1 million volunteer hours that are valued at almost $26 million. So you can be assured that every dollar you appropriate is stretched much farther on the ground, and the Partnership is committed to expanding this leveraging power of the national trails. This impressive system of trails is not yet complete, however, as Amanda talked about so effectively. In order to ensure that the national trails serve the American people most effectively, we are requesting investments in Fiscal Year 2021 for operations, construction, and maintenance for all 30 trails in the Park Service, the Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, and full funding at $900 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with over $38 million of that allocated for the parks. I mean, for the trails. My old job just surfaced. Sorry. Ms. McCollum. As you say, everything connects. Ms. DeCoster. Everything connects. [Laughter.] These funds are critical to ensuring that the integrity of the trails that make up the National Trail System is supported and enhanced now and into the future. My written testimony includes specific funding requests for the varied needs within the Agency's operations, construction, and maintenance categories for all 30 trails, and we are happy to dig in later as you put your bill together on those. We also want to extend our gratitude, as others have, for your continued robust investments in the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the annual allocations to specific national trails. We call for full funding for LWCF in Fiscal Year 2021 so that the entire $900 million that is deposited into the LWCF account every year can be allocated by Congress by this subcommittee to the conservation and recreation programs for which that funding is intended. We understand that within your current budget allocations this is very challenging as well as your need to meet all the other programs, as has been testified to and will continue to be today. So that said, we were very heartened to see a final LWCF appropriation in Fiscal Year 2020 that was the highest in 17 years. We really appreciate that. LWCF funding for the national trails is critical. There continued to be identified needs for land acquisitions along several national trails, totaling almost $40 million in Fiscal Year 2021, and the specifics are highlighted in our written testimony. Full funding of LCWF and the allocation of some of those funds to specific trails will give trail managers the tools they need to protect important trail resources and ensure that the National Trail System can meet the needs of the American people. Thank you again for allowing us to testify today, and we look forward to working with you as you put your bill together. [The statement of Ms. DeCoster follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Well, thank you, and thank you very much for helping me make the case, along with all the colleagues on this committee, that we need a bigger baseline budget. And thank you for the acknowledgement for what this committee did for all LCWF. But we need your help in getting a bigger topline number altogether, and many of the programs that you pointed out, you also want to see an increase in, and that is some of the lines in Forest, and BLM, and Park. So altogether, it just puts more pressure on the dollars. And I appreciate also the singling out of some of the trails and some of the connections that you want to do, but as of right now, we are not able to specify anything but putting things in the topline number due to constraints with not having full agreement with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that that we can specify certain trails or certain projects. I would like to see us do some of that where we can get something completed and done, and move on to the next one, but that is the discussion that will continue to take place on this side of the Capitol, but also has to take place on the other side of the Capitol to do that. So thank you. I just want to thank you for helping me make the case where we need to work with a bigger allocation, and for also recognizing not only the testimony that you heard today, but what we will hear from our tribal brothers and sisters who also work on many of the projects that you are working on together. So I can't thank you enough. I don't have a question for you because you got everything laid out for me to take when I go in and make my argument. So thank you from the top of my heart for helping me make the case that our subcommittee needs a larger allocation, period. And we all want to work together for finding that permanent funding solution for LWCF because that will help this committee in being able to move forward on those joint projects that you so all eloquently put out. Ms. Pingree? Ms. Pingree. No, I didn't really have anything. I appreciate your helping people to understand just beyond this room that it is the big number that governs everything else. So thanks for everyone's hard work and doing all that we can. I get to work with almost all of you, except the Continental Divide, which is way too far away. [Laughter.] But anyway, it is a wonderful part of the trail system, and thanks for providing this map. It is really impressive to see what all of them are. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. McCollum. And I know, having worked on environmental policy for many, many years, Peter, we like you. But I just want to cherish this moment of all the women sitting here at the table on both sides. [Laughter.] Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause.] Ms. DeCoster. Thank you. Ms. McCollum. So as I pointed out--thank you to the third panel--we have colleagues coming in and out. We have full testimony in front of us, and they will be joining back again shortly. I figured out a way to kind of get us back on time, and that is not to do the double introductions. So, Ms. White, I am going to let you lead it off and give us the full background of who you are supporting, and go right into your testimony. And we will start it will start the timer when you go into your testimony, not for introducing yourself. Thank you. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA WITNESS KASEY WHITE, DIRECTOR FOR GEOSCIENCE POLICY, GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA Ms. White. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much, Chairwoman McCollum. My name is Kasey White, and I am pleased to testify today in support of the U.S. Geological Survey, on behalf of the Geological Society of America. GSA is a scientific society with more than 20,000 members from Academia industry, and government in more than 100 countries. GSA applauds the work of the subcommittee to increase the USGS budget in Fiscal Year 2020. Thank you for supporting the Survey and ensuring its ability to continue to serve the Nation through its research and partnerships. GSA or urges Congress to build on these investments and provide USGS with $1.35 billion in Fiscal Year 2021. This increase will allow the USGS to implement new initiatives created by recent legislation, sustain base funding for critical research and monitoring, and update and maintain its facilities. The USGS is one of the Nation's premier science agencies with the distinctive capacity to engage interdisciplinary teams of experts to gather data, conduct research, and develop integrated decision support tools about our earth. In addition to underpinning the science activities and decisions of the Department of the Interior, USGS research is used by communities and businesses Across the Nation to make informed decisions regarding land use planning, emergency response, natural resource management, engineering, and education. The recent passage of several pieces of legislation illustrates the bipartisan congressional support for the Agency. Last year, the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation Management and Recreation Act established a national volcano early warning and monitoring system at the USGS, and reauthorize the USGS' National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. The previous year, the enactment of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018 reauthorized and expanded this important program, including adding our earthquake early warning capabilities. GSA recommends adequate funding to implement these laws. USGS research addresses many of society's greatest challenges. For example, natural hazards are a major cause of fatalities and economic losses. NOAA found that in 2019, the United States saw 14 weather and climate events with losses exceeding $1 billion, which included floods, severe storms, tropical cyclones, and wildfires. USGS data is utilized by decision makers in many sectors to mitigate the effects of these natural disasters. For example, the aviation sector relies upon USGS volcano monitoring to create safe flight routes. NOAA depends on data from the USGS to issue flood, drought, and tsunami warnings. USGS is a key partner in obtaining measurements necessary to predict severe space weather events, which can have drastic impacts on the electric power grid, satellite communications, and navigation systems as highlighted in the March 2019 executive order coordinating national resilience to electromagnetic pulses. GSA urges investment in the USGS hazards programs as an improved scientific understanding of these events will reduce future losses by informing effective planning and mitigation. In addition to conducting research on long-term patterns of climate change, USGS connects science to local communities. Climate adaptation science centers provide scientific information necessary to anticipate, monitor, and adapt to the effects of climate change at regional and local levels. These centers work with communities to make smart, cost-effective decisions on issues as diverse as protecting cultural resources to planning for wildfires. GSA appreciates the expansion of this important program and Fiscal Year 2020. As the U.S. increases its use of renewable energy, there is a vital need to understand the abundance and distribution of critical mineral resources both within the U.S. and globally. This goal will require expanded collection and analysis of geological, geochemical, and geophysical data. Earth MRIs are an important part of this effort, and GSA appreciates congressional support for this program. The Landsat Satellite Program has amassed the largest archive of remotely-sensed data in the world, a tremendously important resource for everything from natural resource planning, land use planning, and assessing water resources, the impacts of natural disasters, and global agriculture. GSA supports interagency efforts to ensure the continuation of this vital monitoring program. All of these endeavors are supported by the core systems sciences, facilities, and science support. These programs and services, such as geologic mapping and data preservation, provide critical information and infrastructure that form the foundation of USGS research. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony today for the support of the U.S. Geological Survey. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The statement of Ms. White follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Make sure the mike is on. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. 3DEP COALITION WITNESS JOHN M. PALATIELLO, 3DEP COALITION Mr. Palatiello. Thank you, Madam Chair. My name is John Palatiello, and I am pleased to be here today on behalf of the 3DEP Coalition. I am also the government affairs consultant to the National Society of Professional Surveyors, and the founder and president of USGO, the informal coalition of leading geospatial firms. The 3DEP Coalition includes more than 40 organizations. If I may, I would like to insert into the record a list of these organizations that support the 3DEP program. Ms. McCollum. We will do that. Just make sure that you leave that at the end of the presentation. Mr. Palatiello. I will do. Thank you. Thank you very much. As the subcommittee is aware, 3DEP is the USGS program that is satisfying the growing demand for consistent, high-quality topographic data across the country, primarily through the collection of elevation data with LIDAR. There are more than 600 applications that benefit from this data. They support economic growth, responsible environmental protection and resource development, infrastructure improvement, and many more. USGS' own assessment of this program shows that it generates about $13 billion in annual benefits and has a benefit cost ratio of 4.7 to 1, so it is an extraordinary investment of our tax dollars. And I would say that it provides the underpinning to a number of the programs that you will hear about in the course of the public witnesses here today. Since 2015, over 200 Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental partners have collaborated in support of 3DEP. I have a map here that my colleague is showing that where now about 67 percent of the Nation is completed with this data for the first time over. The optimal funding for this program is at $146 million a year. At that level, the country can be mapped in 7 years and then go on another repeat cycle. So at our current funding level, we are at about 67 percent. I would like to draw your attention to two things with regard to this map. One, Madam chair, I think jumps out at you is there is unfortunately a big white space in the middle of the country other than perhaps the Twin Cities. And so is a tremendous need for precision agriculture for stormwater management, for a variety of applications in agricultural America. The other point that I think is very important to draw attention to is the fact that the other major unmapped part of the country is the public lands west, and there is a critical need whether you are talking about wildfire mapping, rural broadband development, rural infrastructure. We would hope that the subcommittee could fund this program not only through USGS, but through the other agencies. It is the landowners, the Forest Service, BLM, that have an inherent interest in having this data for good management. As I mentioned in the beginning of my statement, 3DEP has supported numerous programs, applications, and activities. I would hasten to add, Mr. Joyce, that in my written statement, I talk about some great work that an Ohio firm is doing on the 3DEP program, and that is being replicated by the other firms that are involved as well. But when we talk about hazard mitigation, energy resource development, wildlife and habitat management, flood plain mapping, flood risk management, agriculture, precision farming, natural resource, conservation, invasive species mapping and mitigation infrastructure, transportation, climate change monitoring, all of these are activities where the 3DEP data becomes good baseline data for all of them. So we would urge the full funding of the program at its optimum level of a $146 million. We understand the constraints on you. Whether we do this solely within USGS or through the other agencies, as I mentioned, there is a critical need to finish the country and provide that data and the benefits that I mentioned. Thank you very much for the opportunity to be with you this morning. [The statement of Mr. Palatiello follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Thursday, February 6, 2020. GEOMAGNETISM WITNESS DAVID JONAS BARDIN, GEOMAGNETISM Mr. Bardin. Chair McCollum, Ranking Member Joyce, Mr. Simpson, Vice Chair Pingree, Mrs. Watson Coleman, I am David Jonas Bardin, and I appreciate your again holding this public hearing and again letting me testify. This subcommittee was the leader on the USGS Geomagnetism Program that had such success in the minibus that was signed into law on December 20th, and I am going to give you all the credit in the world. You identified issues. You identified the issue of what happens when the Air Force withdraws a stipend. You dug into the facts. Your staff went and found out with the Air Force on the one hand, but also with USGS stuff, which they don't tell you in the way the green book, the budget justifications are done nowadays. So you have to dig them out on why three observatories might have been closed down, which really had to do with deferred maintenance issues that I want to raise. And you fully funded the Administration's request for the $1.7 million for 1 more years' worth of the magnetotelluric survey in order to try to do what the President's executive order of March last year calls for, completion in 4 years. So I give you credit. I give you hosanna, and I hope, Madam Chair, that you and your staff again will dig in on some of the issues I want to raise. Today I just want to talk thematically. I am not asking. You raised the appropriation for the USGS Geomagnetism Program, Congress did, to $4 million, which is almost all of the $4.1 million that the House voted for. Your Senate colleagues came around to your advice and your insights, for which I give them credit, but I give you the most credit and thanks. Ms. McCollum. They didn't bring any money with it. Mr. Bardin. The $4 million the minibus appropriates is almost the entire $4.1 million that the House did. The Senate would have had a somewhat lower number. One of the differences was on the magnetotelluric survey that you fully funded the Administration's request. They initially didn't, but then finally in the minibus, they did. There are a couple of things I would like you to look into, and, as I say, this is thematic testimony. After we see the Administration's actual proposal next week, I probably will supplement it. At the very least, I will give you a table which shows you year by year what has been requested and what has been appropriated. And I can't fill in the bottom line now because I don't know it yet. But basically, the history flat, flat, flat until the sequester, and then down, and only last year. Thanks to this subcommittee and the minibus did it go up to the $4 million. I think it should be higher. I would like you to look into at least two questions. One is the $1.7 million for the magnetotelluric survey. This is a new undertaking for USGS and the Geomagnetism Program. They have never done it before. They are working hard to figure out how to do the details, and I hope that you want on a tactful staff level will follow what are the issues at the moment. None of that money has been obligated. Now, it is not remarkable since it was appropriated on December 20th, and none of it has been obligated. But we are not going to feel good about it if that isn't corrected and cured by the end of the Fiscal Year. And I think it is a question of finding what are the roadblocks for the money and what needs to be done there. The second area I would like you to take a look into is deferred maintenance. There is a problem for some of the observatories on deferred maintenance. The formula which works very well for much of the Interior Department doesn't really apply very much to geomagnetic observatories. They are not catering to visitors like national parks. They don't have large numbers of staff people. So to the extent that priorities are set based on health and safety of staff, health and safety of businesses, they really don't apply to a facility wherever it is located. And I think we need some reconsideration. Perhaps the Administration will come up with something on its own, but if not, perhaps either in report language or even more, once you get the facts, that would be helpful. The Geomagnetism program staff does an excellent job of keeping track of the deferred maintenance issues, the accumulating balance. They have the facts. So if you ask them the questions, they can produce the answers, and I trust they will produce truthful answers. But they are not being volunteered because that is not the way it is normally run. I am supposed to stop now, so I will stop. [The statement of Mr. Bardin follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. McCollum. Thank you. We mentioned with the other panel, you know, their succinct way in which they outlined how we needed to have more funding. And I appreciate the way this panel, and, you, sir, in particular, Mr. Bardin, pointed out that the House had money for some of the projects that we're talking about today. But when Mr. Joyce and I went to conference with the Senate, when we left conference, we had $1.3 billion less than what we left the House with. So it is a challenge. And that is why these hearings today are so important to hear your priorities, to give us some questions to be asking the administration, discussions for us to have amongst ourselves, so that with the dollars that we have, we put forth the most robust budget that that meets the needs of the people here. I just want to take an observation because we are talking about earth. And in the testimony about earth science and the studying of earth science, most high schools don't even have an earth science class anymore. They might have a climate studies class in which they are talking about climate trends, but that is different and needs to be incorporated into a more robust earth science class. So I was the only girl in my earth science class---- [Laughter.] And it is something that I have found very useful for me just as taking a biology class or other things like that, because it is the planet we live on. So thank you. As a social studies teacher, I want to thank you for shouting out for earth science because that is where social science and physical science meet each other and other things. So thank you for pointing that out. And I am going to talk to my education colleagues and do some lobbying. Ms. White. Terrific. Thank you. Ms. McCollum. So, Mr. Joyce, thank you for joining us, and I didn't have a question, I had a comment, and so I will turn it over to you and see if there is a question or comment you have. Mr. Joyce. None at this time, but thank you very much for the recognition, and I thank Mr. Simpson for helping me out here. Mrs. Watson Coleman. I am good. Ms. McCollum. Okay. Ms. Pingree. Can I ask a question? Ms. McCollum. Yes. Ms. Pingree. Ms. Pingree. Sorry. I will go home and do a little homework. Thank you all for the important work you do. It is obviously under recognized most of the time, but I will do a little homework. But will you just tell me what 3DEP means? Mr. Palatiello. It is 3-Dimension Elevation Program. Ms. Pingree. Oh, okay. So---- Mr. Palatiello. It is the topographic mapping of the country. It is primarily collected through LIDAR, which is a process where a sensor is mounted in the fuselage an airplane. As it goes along a flight path, it is sending thousands of lasers to the ground, and measuring the time it takes for that laser to leave the airplane, hit the ground, and come back and register with the sensor. And by doing thousands of pulses a second, it goes along and all of a sudden the mountains rise and the valleys fall. And that is how modern topographic mapping is done. So this is a program to do with current topographic mapping of the entire Nation. Ms. Pingree. So, what is the range of an airplane? Like is it---- Mr. Palatiello. The size of the swath? Ms. Pingree. Yeah. Mr. Palatiello. That depends on the altitude of the aircraft, and that will relate to what the scale and resolution of the mapping is that is guys hired. So the lower it is, the broader the swath, and the higher resolution the data is. The higher the altitude is, the more narrow the swath and the less accurate or larger scale the mapping will be. So what this program does is it did create sort of a common denominator for the accuracy. All the stakeholders were brought together. A study was done and looked at both what was a reasonable budget and what was a scale of mapping that would meet the greatest number of needs. And that is the standard in 3DEP. Ms. Pingree. So last question. So the topographic maps that we currently have, we have them, but you are doing like the next sort of digital electronic---- Mr. Palatiello. Yes. So you remember the pink and green topographic maps with the contours. This is the next generation. This is the replacement to that, which produces the benefit of being both digital data so it can be used to plot it and manipulate it, and also it can be printed. Ms. Pingree. Perfect. Thanks so much. Mr. Palatiello. Thank you. Ms. McCollum. I am just going to add on because I think one of the things that you can 3DEP that we can't do with some of the better precision satellites that we have where we can move and position faster, is now we have a full complement. And I think this is very exciting that if we need to look at something, what is happening with a flood plain in a large swath area, we are getting better satellite image to do that. But you can do something that they can't do, and that is, and I know the reason why Minnesota is not mapped is because of our trees. Ms. Pingree. Yes---- Ms. McCollum. No, the reason why they are not mapped is because of our trees, because the satellites can't do what you can do. And if you would explain a little more about what LiDAR can do that the satellites can't do. And this is why they complement each other and it is so exciting. My trees don't get in the way. That is not why I am not mapped. Mr. Palatiello. Well, there are a lot of trees in Maine as well, and you can see Maine is a further along. [Laughter.] So LiDAR does---- Ms. McCollum. All right, guys. I have the gavel. [Laughter.] Minnesota wins. Mr. Palatiello. What LiDAR does is the technology enables the collection of what I described before about the timing and the distance from the sensor to the ground and back. You can do that to the treetop, or you can do it to the bare earth, and that way you can penetrate those tree canopies. When we used to do mapping with old conventional aerial photography, in Maine, for example, and Minnesota, particularly the northern tier States in the country, particularly those where you had deciduous trees, you could only fly aerial photography mapping during a time of the year where there is snow. Think about this in Maine. No snow on the ground. The sun is high enough where you don't have long shadows. You can only do it around noon time, I mean, a couple of hours midday, and no leaves on the tree. What is that? That is 3 days in March in Maine? [Laughter.] I mean, in all seriousness, that was the challenge with conventional aerial photography and photogrammetry. You no longer have those constraints with LiDAR. The other benefit of LiDAR is because you can measure that tree canopy, this is an extraordinary tool in measuring, monitoring, verifying, and validate the effects of climate change. You can measure the biomass, and if we had a program where were doing the country every year, we can go back year by year and saying, well, we are losing 3 percent of our biomass in the country. And we don't have that data now, so we can't define the effects or measure the effects as precisely as we would like, but the technology is there. Ms. McCollum. So we have two tools in the toolbox. When we can combine them now, we can get amazing, amazing in-depth and real-time imagery. So it just means we have to be more creative on how we finance both of these types of mapping to go forward because they are both critically important. Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. No, I don't have any questions. I feel like what I have learned here just in the last few minutes is that we have a lot more forestry programs in Minnesota. [Laughter.] Thank you. Ms. McCollum. Good morning, Mr. Stewart. Did you have a question for the panel? Mr. Stewart. No. Thank you. Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mr. Joyce. Madam Chair. Ms. McCollum. Yes? Mr. Joyce. I think there is somebody at the table who is celebrating today, if I am not mistaken. Ms. McCollum. Really? Mr. Joyce. There might be a birthday? Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you. [Laughter.] Ms. McCollum. I respect you so much, Bonnie, I will not lead ``Happy Birthday'' in a song. [Laughter.] I would drive all our witnesses who are ready to approach the table out of the room. I was asked to sing softly many times in grade school. So, Ranking Member Joyce, what we have been doing to stay on time is we have been having the panels introduce themselves. Mr. Joyce. That is great. Ms. McCollum. And not counting their introduction time against their testimony time. And we have found that, as you come down in the panelists, right, you don't want to be the one that is running 15 minutes, now it is 20, now it is a half an hour behind. So I want to thank the panels for doing that. I will probably be leaving during this panel, so after the introductions, Mr. Joyce, Ms. Pingree will be taking the gavel. Mr. Joyce. I am used to ladies being in charge on this committee. [Laughter.] Ms. McCollum. Thank you. So please start. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. THE CORPS NETWORK WITNESS MARY ELLEN SPRENKEL, PRESIDENT AND CEO, THE CORPS NETWORK Ms. Sprenkel. Chairwoman McCollum, Ranking Member Joyce, members of the subcommittee, my name is Mary Ellen Sprenkel, and I am the president and CEO of the Corps Network. On behalf of the Corps Network, our 131 member corps, and the 25,000 diverse Corps members they annually engage, thank you for the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee about utilizing service and conservation corps to complete priority projects with the National Park Service and related public land management agencies. Based on the model and philosophy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, today's corps are locally- based nonprofit organizations that engage young people between the ages of 16 and 30, and recently returned veterans up to age 35, in service projects that address conservation, recreation, disaster response, and community needs. Through a term of service that could last several months to 1 year, corps participants or corps members gain work experience and develop in-demand skills. Corps members are compensated with a stipend or living allowance, and often receive an educational award or scholarship upon completing their term of service. Additionally, corps provide participants with educational programming, mentoring, access to career and personal counseling, and supportive services. Like the Civilian Conservation Corps, today's corps work with the land management agencies to maintain and improve our natural resources and recreation infrastructure. Last year alone, corps built, improved, or maintained more than 13,000 miles of multiuse trail and waterways, restored 1.4 million acres of wild wildlife and fish habitat, cleared almost 67,000 acres of invasive species, removed 19,000 acres of hazardous fuel, increased access to and utilization of nearly 8,000 recreational facilities, responded to 223 wildfires and other natural disasters, preserved 336 historic structures, and planted almost 1.1 million trees. Further, they leveraged an additional 107,000 volunteers who completed 537,000 service hours valuing more than $13 million. In addition to traditional natural resource work, many corps participate in projects to preserve America's historic and cultural resources. Six years ago, the Corps Network partnered with the Historic Trust for Historic Preservation to develop the Hope Crew Model, and under this model traditional corps crews work side by side with a historic preservation expert to refurbish and maintain historic structures and facilities. Several hundred projects have been completed in the years since. Through these projects, corps members not only develop a sense of connection to our country's history, but learn marketable job skills. Regardless of the type of project, land managers find corps to be cost effective and capable of producing high-quality work. The National Park Service commissioned an independent study by Booz Allen Hamilton, which found that corps can save up to 87 percent on certain maintenance projects. In addition, in regular surveys, virtually all Federal partners report being highly satisfied with the project work and say they would work with a corps again. With over $19 billion in deferred maintenance on Federal lands, we need to harness America's growing enthusiasm for the great outdoors and engage more people in service and volunteerism on public lands. One obvious strategy is to engage and bring to scale the existing network of corps to start tackling a variety of deferred maintenance projects already identified by the Restore Our Parks Project, which we will hear more about in a moment. The National Park Service relies on several funding streams to engage corps in this work. Therefore, we respectfully request that you support funding increases that directly address deferred maintenance needs within the National Park System. Specifically, we request strong funding levels for the repair and rehabilitation, cyclic maintenance, and line item construction accounts. In addition, we also request robust funding for similar accounts of other land management agencies under your jurisdiction, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Corps have long been cost-effective partners of Federal land management agencies, and have been working to generate excitement and new ways to engage youth and veterans in outdoor service, while helping to accomplish much-needed project work. The time has come to seriously consider corps as an essential part of any plan to tackle deferred maintenance and usher in future stewards and champions of our natural treasures. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I welcome any questions. [The statement of Ms. Sprenkel follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Ms. Pingree [presiding]. Thank you. Ms. Brengel. ---------- Thursday, February 6, 2020. NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION WITNESS KRISTEN BRENGEL, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION Ms. Brengel. Yes. Thank you so much for having me. My name is Kristen Brengle. I am the vice chair of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association. I want to thank Ranking Member Joyce and members of the subcommittee for giving us the opportunity to testify today. We are grateful for the work that all of you do on behalf of the national parks. In fact, this committee is full of park champions that we are thrilled about. Ranking Member Joyce, I want to thank you in particular for your work on the Great Lakes, pollution, invasive species, all of the issues up there. It has been great working with you and your staff. We truly appreciate all the subcommittee does for parks given scarce funding. As the chair pointed out earlier, the overall budget is tough to work with. In particular, we want to thank you for the land and water conservation funding last year. It was particularly impressive. So I am here to share some concerns that we have about the current state of our national parks and our worries about the staff who protect them. We are hearing and seeing the following. Morale is low. This is due to weakening policies, a looming reorganization, and a lack of leadership. In fact, as some of you may know, 10 of the 16 senior park service positions that oversee critical departments, including operations, interpretation, visitor, and resource protection, and even the acting National Park Service director, are either vacant or without a permanent leader. Second, many parks are suffering unrepaired damage, as my colleague pointed out to the right, and the effects of climate change. The other issue and, Ms. Pingree, you know this very well, some of our popular parks are completely overcrowded, including Acadia, which I was just there. Beautiful. [Laughter.] And this can lead to resource harm. The other issue is conservation, is taking a backseat to development outside of their borders. This is due to rampant drilling and mining, proposals which this committee is very well aware of. And specifically we thank you for Chaco, for the language on Chaco Cultural. In the last 3 years, NPCA has documented 112 administrative actions that erode protections for waterways, wildlife, visitor experiences, air quality, and quality of life for staff. The consequences of these actions could be felt for generations. We appreciate the committee's willingness to consider some of these issues as you deliberate the bill. To dive specifically into the National Parks Service budget, park operations and deferred maintenance are our highest funding priorities. One of the largest challenges facing park superintendents is operating budgets insufficient to prevent the reduction of personnel. One superintendent recently reported uncontrollable fixed costs of more than 5 percent. This will no doubt result in fewer staff. One area where the staff shortage becomes a major issue is with the huge influx of visitors to many popular parks. With inadequate staff, national parks are getting crushed. Joshua Tree, for example, no longer has an off season. There are just tons of people there through the year. In 2018, there were 1.6 million more visitors than a decade prior, similar to Zion and other parks in Utah. That 125 percent increase in visitation was coupled by a 31 percent erosion of base staffing levels. As an example, a Joshua Tree ranger was making sure cars weren't parking on the side of the road, crushing vegetation. When asked the range what his job actually was, he said he was on the trail crew. Because he was dealing with so many visitors, he couldn't work on the trail. This means less maintenance. The lack of operations funding has a ripple effect. Now getting to the deferred maintenance backlog, it is one of our highest priorities, and my colleague at Pew next to me is going to testify in greater detail on this important issue. But one example to point out is Great Sand Dunes. Some of the pressing projects are very connected to visitors. The visitor center roof, re-roofing of the comfort stations, and rehabilitation of campgrounds, these are just some of the thousands of examples that there are cross the park system. We are working on other funding sources, including the bill that Mr. Kilmer is leading, the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act. We are thankful for that bill, and we appreciate all the co-sponsors here. We hope that it gets signed into law this year, but we still need this committee to focus on deferred maintenance and routine maintenance as we look at the budget. I should note a huge thanks for the Centennial Challenge funding, which also helps with the maintenance backlog and great programs; National Heritage Area funding, which is also a wonderful program; Endangered Species Act funding, and, course, the EPA's geographic programs in last year's bill. As I mentioned earlier, we are alarmed by the impacts of climate change. We must ensure the Park Service has the resources and guidance they need to monitor climate change impacts to the parks, and utilize the best available science to help parks adapt to climate change. We can reduce repair costs if parks have the funds they need to be resilient from the start. On another topic, we appreciate your oversight on the Interior Department's reorganization. We are concerned not just about the BLM move, but the potential for a larger initiative to harm management and stewardship of our parks. We don't want the reorganization to undermine the Park Service's co"
